    "content": "The Russia investigation is a sham . It \u2019 s actually a cover story for special counsel Robert Mueller and Donald Trump working together to expose thousands of pedophiles hidden in plain sight \u2014 including Hillary Clinton ( and Bill Clinton , and Barack Obama ) , who will soon be under arrest . ( Or perhaps already have been and are on their way to Guantanamo Bay . )\nThe GOP lost the Alabama special election for Jeff Sessions \u2019 s Senate seat on purpose \u2014 a plan devised years ago to reveal the use of fraudulent voting machines and , ultimately , take down none other than George Soros . Or the Rothschilds . Or the Illuminati .\nAnd there \u2019 s no White House chaos at all ; in fact , despite legal scandals and special counsel investigations and bile-laden tweets , everything , absolutely everything , is going just as Donald Trump intended it .\nWelcome to QAnon , sometimes referred to as \u201c the Storm. \u201d It \u2019 s a conspiracy theory that \u2019 s swept social media and is starting to break into the mainstream , with Trump rally attendees in Florida on July 31 holding signs and wearing T-shirts emblazoned with \u201c We are Q \u201d and the conspiracy theory \u2019 s main catchphrase , \u201c Where we go one , we go all . \u201d\njust some extremely normal people at an extremely normal political rally for an extremely normal president https : //t.co/0Gxa9sa81B pic.twitter.com/9Z2pDX9zCg \u2014 Andrew Kirell ( @ AndrewKirell ) July 31 , 2018\nRoseanne Barr , formerly the star of the No . 1 show on network television , is just one of Q \u2019 s biggest supporters . And the conspiracy theory is being pushed by some of the far right \u2019 s biggest voices , including Alex Jones and Sean Hannity . Still others are winking and nodding at it , retweeting # QAnon references while pretending to be none the wiser .\nAnd it has one overarching \u2014 and , if you \u2019 re a Trump supporter , hopeful \u2014 message : Donald Trump is in complete control . Of everything .\nConspiracy theories create order out of chaos , attempting to make sense of events that don \u2019 t make sense . And researchers have found that fact-based arguments against them only serve to reinforce them in the minds of believers . That \u2019 s what makes QAnon or Sandy Hook trutherism or any other conspiracy theory so difficult to combat : Because conspiracy theories aren \u2019 t based on facts , conspiracy theorists aren \u2019 t receptive to them either .\nSo if the first year and a half of the Trump administration has been enmeshed in confusion and chaos , QAnon is the conspiratorial response : Everything is fine . As a popular saying among Q adherents proclaims , believers must only \u201c trust the plan . \u201d\nTrust the plan . \u2014 Laura Loomer \u274c ( @ LauraLoomer ) June 30 , 2018\nThe beginnings of \u201c the Storm \u201d lie with Donald Trump himself .\nOn October 5 , 2017 , during a photo opportunity held before a military dinner , Trump said that the dinner was \u201c Maybe the calm before the storm. \u201d When a reporter asked , \u201c What storm , Mr. President ? \u201d Trump responded , \u201c You \u2019 ll find out . \u201d\nTRUMP : `` You 'll find out . '' ( via Satellite News ) pic.twitter.com/bWMzGrDPNa \u2014 Kyle Griffin ( @ kylegriffin1 ) October 5 , 2017\nFor non-conspiracy theorists , this was Trump-speak . He tends to just say things that have little to no relevance in anything either he or his administration will actually do \u2014 like that \u201c maybe we should give \u201d the Chinese style of one-man dictatorship \u201c a shot . \u201d\nBut for conspiracy theorists on Reddit , already primed to believe in code words and secrets and , well , conspiracies , \u201c the Storm \u201d soon became the most important \u201c movement \u201d of the Trump era .\nThe first post from an anonymous user claiming to be a high-level government informant came on October 28 , on the 4chan message board /pol/ . The user was nicknamed \u201c Q \u201d after Q-level security clearance , the Department of Energy equivalent of \u201c Top Secret. \u201d ( \u201c NG \u201d refers to the National Guard . )\nHRC extradition already in motion effective yesterday with several countries in case of cross border run . Passport approved to be flagged effective 10/30 @ 12:01am . Expect massive riots organized in defiance and others fleeing the US to occur . US M \u2019 s will conduct the operation while NG activated . Proof check : Locate a NG member and ask if activated for duty 10/30 across most major cities .\nA few hours later , Q posted again , adding coded phrases that /pol/ users would interpret and argue over for months . In short , he or she appeared to state that Hillary Clinton had been \u201c detained \u201d by authorities and that Trump knew that \u201c criminal rogue elements , \u201d including Clinton , had to be arrested , while referencing billionaire philanthropist George Soros , himself the subject of a number of conspiracy theories .\nThese postings were thrilling for people steeped in far-right conspiracy theory lore \u2014 from the very real Operation Mockingbird , a CIA effort to blackmail journalists and give out false information to share propaganda , to the wild theory that Huma Abedin , a former Hillary Clinton staffer and ex-wife of Anthony Weiner , was secretly working for the Muslim Brotherhood . ( She wasn \u2019 t . )\nEven the name Q seemed to imply that this person knew things others didn \u2019 t . The rapidly expanding group of people who follow Q \u2019 s postings \u2014 and believe them \u2014 became known as QAnon .\nQ has tried to offer \u201c proof \u201d that he , she , or they have real intel . ( They posted images that redditors believed confirmed Q was on Air Force One , and thus had real information from the president himself . ) Some followers even believe that Trump is Q \u2014 though others think it \u2019 s John F. Kennedy Jr. , who they believe faked his 1999 death .\nQ offered real hope to Trump supporters : Everything is fine , Trump has everything under control , and everyone who stands in his way will soon be sent to prison . Literally .\nIn a posting on November 1 , 2017 , Q said that on November 3 and 4 , John Podesta , chair of Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign , would be arrested , military control would take hold , and \u201c public riots would be organized in serious numbers to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials \u201d :\nMy fellow Americans , over the course of the next several days you will undoubtedly realize that we are taking back our great country ( the land of the free ) from the evil tyrants that wish to do us harm and destroy the last remaining refuge of shining light . On POTUS \u2019 order , we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta ( actionable 11.4 ) . ... We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System ( EMS ) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message ( avoiding the fake news ) to all citizens . Organizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury \u2013 certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations ( at home and abroad ) .\nObviously , none of this happened . There were no public riots or mass arrests or the use of emergency broadcasts . ( In fact , the Emergency Broadcast System went out of service in 1997 , replaced by the Emergency Alert System . )\nThe overwhelming majority of Q \u2019 s assertions are hilariously untrue : that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was placed in power by the CIA , that Seth Rich was murdered by MS13 under orders from former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz , that many prominent Democrats are currently wearing ankle monitors because they are secretly under arrest .\nThe fact is that QAnon \u2019 s base assertion \u2014 that Trump really is in control of everything \u2014 is an inherently strange one to make when the Trump administration does , actually , control the entire federal government .\nBut that didn \u2019 t stop QAnon from percolating , first moving from 4chan to 8chan ( 4chan \u2019 s weirder equivalent ) , and then pushing outward on the internet , to Twitter and YouTube , with believers making \u201c explainer \u201d videos about QAnon that get hundreds of thousands of views .\nConspiracy theorists and members of the alt-right and far right were among the first to jump on the QAnon bandwagon ( though some have decided Q has been \u201c compromised \u201d ) .\nBut so did leaders of a right-leaning anti-abortion group , and so did some celebrities , like Roseanne . As New York magazine \u2019 s Paris Martineau detailed in December 2017 , the QAnon hashtag has been used so many times on Twitter it \u2019 s now virtually untrackable .\nQAnon is now about everything \u2014 and it \u2019 s in the real world\nQAnon has only gotten bigger over the past few months . Former MLB pitcher and conservative pundit Curt Schilling shared a video on Twitter in June that alleges that QAnon isn \u2019 t just about Trump . It claims every US president before Trump was engaged in a criminal conspiracy with pedophile rings and the \u201c deep state \u201d and pharmaceutical companies , all to enslave the American people .\nI 've been asked about the `` Q '' for a few months now . Not really knowing who or what it was in any sort of detail . Started researching this movement a few weeks ago and someone sent this to me today . Pretty much impossible to stop watching once you start https : //t.co/5829JEuhSj \u2014 Curt Schilling ( @ gehrig38 ) June 26 , 2018\nQ occasionally references the Pizzagate conspiracy theory , which led one man to walk into a pizzeria in Washington , DC , with an assault rifle because conspiracy theorists claimed that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta ran a child sex ring in the basement . Accusations of pedophilia aimed at celebrities , companies , and politicians are a critical part of QAnon .\nRoseanne and others have tweeted that the purportedly \u201c unprecedented \u201d increase in sex trafficking arrests taking place under the Trump administration is the direct result of Trump working with Mueller to arrest pedophiles nationwide . ( For the record , there has not been an \u201c unprecedented \u201d increase in sex trafficking arrests . )\nThere \u2019 s a reason for this : As Slate \u2019 s Christina Cauterucci wrote in July , accusations of pedophilia are the easiest and most effective way to tarnish someone \u2019 s reputation with no proof necessary , as pedophilia is universally considered a horrific and horrendous affront .\nAnd since perhaps the only thing even more horrendous is the murder of children , it \u2019 s no wonder , then , that one of the main proponents of QAnon posted on YouTube that Americans would be forced to comprehend \u201c films of innocent children pleading for their lives while people are butchering them \u201d once \u201c the Storm \u201d came to pass . QAnon isn \u2019 t about protecting Trump , in their view . It \u2019 s about saving children from rape and murder \u2014 and who could oppose that ?\nBut the open source nature of QAnon , where Q posts something for thousands of other people to interpret as they see fit , means other conspiracy theories fit neatly within QAnon \u2014 like ones about false flag shootings , Jewish bankers controlling the world , or the Illuminati . As the Daily Beast \u2019 s Will Sommer wrote in July :\nWhile the Storm is at the center of the QAnon narrative , it \u2019 s also flexible enough to fold in just anything that makes the news . Q is fond of hinting that each mass shooting is a false-flag attack organized by the cabal , and he used a blurry webcam picture of a flash of light near the Puget Sound to claim that the deep state had tried to shoot down Trump \u2019 s plane .\nOne recent example : When NBC \u2019 s Ben Collins went on the Today show on Wednesday to attempt to explain QAnon , one poster alleged that his script had been \u201c written by Jacob Rothschild. \u201d The Rothschild family has been the center of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for centuries , and for the record , Jacob Rothschild is 82 years old , lives in England , and is not writing \u201c scripts \u201d for the Today show .\nsaw this live about an hour ago .. total hit job .. completely biased and clearly a script written by Jacob Rothschild himself .. @ oneunderscore__ is responsible .. but he does what Jacob wants .. they really don \u2019 t have much ammunition left .. getting closer to MASS ARRESTS # PEDOVORES # QAnon https : //t.co/qf0P4kjUQn \u2014 # ARRESTPODESTA ( @ ARRESTPODESTA ) August 1 , 2018\nBeginning in early 2018 , QAnon adherents made their way to the world outside the internet . In April , 200 QAnon supporters marched in DC . In June , when the Inspector General released its report criticizing the actions of FBI officials like former Director James Comey during the investigation into Clinton \u2019 s emails , QAnon insisted there was a second , secret report , which would send virtually every high-level Democrat to Guantanamo Bay if they weren \u2019 t already on their way .\nOne man , Matthew Wright , took a rifle and a handgun and barricaded himself in his car on the Hoover Dam , holding a sign reading \u201c RELEASE THE OIG MEMO , \u201d referring to that supposed second report .\nThe man arrested was Matthew P. Wright , age 30 of Henderson , NV . \u2014 JJ MacNab ( @ jjmacnab ) June 16 , 2018\nAnd Michael Avenatti , Stormy Daniels \u2019 s attorney , was allegedly followed in person by a QAnon believer on July 29 , while Q posted that a \u201c message \u201d had been sent .\nAs the Pizzagate incident in DC showed , conspiracy theories breaking into the real world have consequences . And those consequences can be extremely dangerous in a charged political climate \u2014 and in a media environment with no overarching guardrails \u2014 where nothing is false and anything could be true .\nConspiracy theories are hard to fight because they \u2019 re about what we want to believe\nOther conspiracy theorists have attempted to throw cold water on QAnon , like this blogger who wrote that he too had been a believer but , after reviewing the evidence , concluded that he had \u201c been tricked \u201d by a LARPer ( live-action role player ) creating a fantastical story for their own entertainment . But true believers remain deeply committed .\nConspiracy theories like QAnon are \u201c self-sealing \u201d \u2014 meaning that evidence against them can become evidence of their validity in the minds of believers , according to Stephan Lewandowsky , a professor at the University of Bristol who studies conspiracy theories and conspiracists . Trying to disprove a conspiracy theory thus usually only serves to reinforce it .\n\u201c For example , if scientists are accused of creating a \u201c hoax , \u201d such as climate change , but they are then exonerated by multiple enquiries , then a conspiracy theorist will not accept that as evidence of their innocence , but as evidence of a broad conspiracy ( to create a world government or whatever ) that involves the government , judiciary , Soros , and anyone else who once shared a supermarket checkout line with Al Gore in the 1970s , \u201d Lewandowsky said .\nAnd here \u2019 s the really important point : Conspiracy theories aren \u2019 t created by evidence , but by belief , or by the desire to believe , that there must be something more to the events that shape our lives , culture , and politics than accident or happenstance .\nWhere there is confusion , or even pain and tragedy , QAnon , or shootings termed \u201c false flags , \u201d or 9/11 trutherism brings some semblance of order and security . The 9/11 attacks were so horrific that they can \u2019 t possibly have happened without President George W. Bush being behind it somehow , orchestrating things behind the scenes . A mass shooting at an elementary school that killed so many small children is so terrible that it can \u2019 t possibly have really happened . And the Trump administration must only seem to be enmeshed in constant chaos .\nConspiracy theories often serve an ironic function of providing a sense of order in chaos . People would rather believe that there are evil masterminds out there that pull strings on cataclysmic events than accept the occurrence of random events . Conspiracy theories also serve to elevate events to be less banal : For example , it is easier to conceive of Princess Diana having been killed by some elaborate evil conspiracy than being the victim of a rather banal drunk-driving accident . So whenever there is a tragic or cataclysmic event , some people will find a conspiracy theory more acceptable than the\u2014often\u2014more uninteresting official account .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : Most people have never heard of QAnon , or Q \u2014 and that includes most of Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters . But there are those who do believe in QAnon \u2014 that Trump and Mueller are actually working together to arrest Democrats and Obama officials ( who are all also pedophiles and cannibals ) , that everything is actually under control .\nQAnon provides a soothing balm , telling believers that the only people who really know what \u2019 s going on are the believers \u2014 and the president .",

In June, when the Inspector General released its report criticizing the actions of FBI officials like former Director James Comey during the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, QAnon insisted there was a second, secret report, which would send virtually every high-level Democrat to Guantanamo Bay if they weren\u2019t already on their way.\n\nOne man, Matthew Wright, took a rifle and a handgun and barricaded himself in his car on the Hoover Dam, holding a sign reading \u201cRELEASE THE OIG MEMO,\u201d referring to that supposed second report.\n\nThe man arrested was Matthew P. Wright, age 30 of Henderson, NV. \u2014 JJ MacNab (@jjmacnab) June 16, 2018\n\nAnd Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels\u2019s attorney, was allegedly followed in person by a QAnon believer on July 29, while Q posted that a \u201cmessage\u201d had been sent.\n\nAs the Pizzagate incident in DC showed, conspiracy theories breaking into the real world have consequences. And those consequences can be extremely dangerous in a charged political climate \u2014 and in a media environment with no overarching guardrails \u2014 where nothing is false and anything could be true.\n\nConspiracy theories are hard to fight because they\u2019re about what we want to believe\n\nOther conspiracy theorists have attempted to throw cold water on QAnon, like this blogger who wrote that he too had been a believer but, after reviewing the evidence, concluded that he had \u201cbeen tricked\u201d by a LARPer (live-action role player) creating a fantastical story for their own entertainment. But true believers remain deeply committed.\n\nConspiracy theories like QAnon are \u201cself-sealing\u201d \u2014 meaning that evidence against them can become evidence of their validity in the minds of believers, according to Stephan Lewandowsky, a professor at the University of Bristol who studies conspiracy theories and conspiracists. Trying to disprove a conspiracy theory thus usually only serves to reinforce it.\n\n\u201cFor example, if scientists are accused of creating a \u201choax,\u201d such as climate change, but they are then exonerated by multiple enquiries, then a conspiracy theorist will not accept that as evidence of their innocence, but as evidence of a broad conspiracy (to create a world government or whatever) that involves the government, judiciary, Soros, and anyone else who once shared a supermarket checkout line with Al Gore in the 1970s,\u201d Lewandowsky said.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the really important point: Conspiracy theories aren\u2019t created by evidence, but by belief, or by the desire to believe, that there must be something more to the events that shape our lives, culture, and politics than accident or happenstance.\n\nWhere there is confusion, or even pain and tragedy, QAnon, or shootings termed \u201cfalse flags,\u201d or 9/11 trutherism brings some semblance of order and security. The 9/11 attacks were so horrific that they can\u2019t possibly have happened without President George W. Bush being behind it somehow, orchestrating things behind the scenes. A mass shooting at an elementary school that killed so many small children is so terrible that it can\u2019t possibly have really happened. And the Trump administration must only seem to be enmeshed in constant chaos.\n\nAs Lewandowsky told me:\n\nConspiracy theories often serve an ironic function of providing a sense of order in chaos. People would rather believe that there are evil masterminds out there that pull strings on cataclysmic events than accept the occurrence of random events. Conspiracy theories also serve to elevate events to be less banal: For example, it is easier to conceive of Princess Diana having been killed by some elaborate evil conspiracy than being the victim of a rather banal drunk-driving accident. So whenever there is a tragic or cataclysmic event, some people will find a conspiracy theory more acceptable than the\u2014often\u2014more uninteresting official account.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Most people have never heard of QAnon, or Q \u2014 and that includes most of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. But there are those who do believe in QAnon \u2014 that Trump and Mueller are actually working together to arrest Democrats and Obama officials (who are all also pedophiles and cannibals), that everything is actually under control.\n\nQAnon provides a soothing balm, telling believers that the only people who really know what\u2019s going on are the believers \u2014 and the president.\n\nCorrection: A photo caption previously misidentified the website 4chan as part of Reddit.",
