In that piece , I asked who \u2014 struggling dailies , emerging public radio initiatives , spirited startups , local TV stations \u2014 might seize the opportunity of the day and ramp up the kind of local news coverage that readers might support with subscription or membership .\nCould alt-weeklies be part of the solution ? More than 100 of them still populate the landscape , from the hometown Portland \u2019 s Pulitzer-winning Willamette Week to Cincinnati \u2019 s CityBeat to Vermont \u2019 s Seven Days to the L.A. Weekly ( itself just now put for sale ) . The alternative press was born out of an earlier tumult , in the 1960s and \u2019 70s , and I knew it well , having been part of it early in my career . Then , it was \u201c alt \u201d as in counter , as in counterculture \u2014 but that \u2019 s a blast from a fast-disappearing past . Now , these publications almost all build their audiences around things to do , guides , and calendars ; the level of incisive local reporting varies widely .\nFurther , the word \u201c alt \u201d has taken on the dark new reality of \u201c alt-right , \u201d the sanitized neo-Nazi umbrella for those who decry ( \u201c L\u00fcgenpresse ! \u201c ) the press , not build it . And then there \u2019 s the la-la land of \u201c alternative facts \u201d that Kellyanne Conway unveiled to Chuck Todd over the weekend . Throughout the past week , the pages of America \u2019 s news sites have been transformed into what seems an alternative universe itself , as the rat-a-tat-tat of Trump-promised change looks like the flipside of the past eight years .\nThat alt-what dilemma of the weeklies offers just a variation on the theme . For them and for America \u2019 s news media generally , the question grows more urgent by the day : Who are you now and what can you do for would-be paying readers ?\n\u201c Hold the media accountable , and make your public officials hear you , \u201d Zahra Billoo , the executive director of the Bay Area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations told the Washington march Saturday . Expect to hear a lot more of that sentiment . Within the demand comes both a threat and an opportunity to reclaim a paying readership for news that newly matters in subscribers \u2019 lives .\nFundamentally , we \u2019 ve arrived \u2014 possibly again \u2014 at a place where people expect values-oriented media . Let \u2019 s talk about what that may mean , and then , more practically , I \u2019 d like to offer five ways news media can begin to breathe new life into the notion .\n\u201c Values \u201d may seem a scary proposition for much of the legacy press and the digital startup press that has followed it . It can conjure up partisanship or \u201c taking sides , \u201d but it doesn \u2019 t need to .\nTake that word : accountable . Journalists have talked about accountability journalism and practiced it well for decades . But in recent years , it has sometimes seemed like an add-on \u2014 maybe a foundation will fund it ? \u2014 rather than the basic mission of a free press , national and local , in a free society . That \u2019 s how the framers saw it when they gave the press quite a shout-out . They didn \u2019 t do that so that fishmongers , tailors , and alehouse keepers would have a place to advertise . They did it to keep tabs on power .\nAs budgets and newsroom workforces throughout the country have been halved , stenography \u2014 limp , single-source stories \u2014 have become more the rule than the exception . Too few of the remaining local reporters , at the nation \u2019 s 1,370 or so local newspapers \u2014 we have only four national ones \u2014 have both the time and local knowledge to hold local and state politicians and business to account . So they largely \u2014 with very important and award-worthy exceptions \u2014 don \u2019 t do enough of that work . That \u2019 s the certainly a question of capacity , one that I raised last week , and it \u2019 s the gating issue here .\nIncreasingly , though , I \u2019 ve come to believe that we can \u2019 t rebuild local news capacity until we \u2019 re more clear about our 21st-century values . What might we include in those values ?\nIt may not be bad to start with a few Robert Fulghum tips from All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten . They seem oddly modern and newly recited in this toxic political atmosphere :\nThese seem to be human values and American values , and the press can remind all of us about them . Maybe a few additional ones can be borrowed from the Boy Scouts : being trustworthy , loyal , helpful , thrifty , and brave .\nThose are just for starters , though . Try the four principles of the long-established and once universally accepted Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics .\nYes , it does seem quite basic to have to list these , but the times apparently demand remedial courses . Underlying all this , a single word : fairness . Even more than mere \u201c accuracy , \u201d it \u2019 s the word that has driven the best journalists from tiny towns to major metros . It \u2019 s still the best barometer .\nRather than assert some shaky new world or parse meanings of words most everyone understands \u2014 \u201c fact \u201d and \u201c lie \u201d now among them \u2014 the admonition of Washington Post editor Marty Baron , reaffirmed by others , says it simply : \u201c Just do our job . Do it as it \u2019 s supposed to be done . \u201d\nMake no mistake , it \u2019 s not the adoption of a values-based mission that \u2019 s essential . It is acting on these values that must now define news media . If publishers , editors , and general managers \u2014 at dailies , public radio stations , alternative weeklies , TV outlets and emerging digital startups \u2014 assert such values , what work will they point to , each week or each day , that fulfills that promise ? Those news organizations \u2014 The New York Times , The Washington Post , The New Yorker , Vanity Fair , The Atlantic , Mother Jones , The Guardian \u2014 that have seen a boom in subscription sales have done just that . They \u2019 ve done the visible work , and readers have responded .\nThis is the outline of the new social contract I urged last week . A contract is , by its nature , transactional . Journalists , and those who pay them , must make a new bargain , a new offer to their readers and communities \u2014 and then make good on it .\nI wonder how many of the 3 million or so people marching on Saturday \u2014 and of all those lighting up the lines of Congress this week \u2014 subscribe to a newspaper . I bet you many of them did once but no longer do .\nThey probably didn \u2019 t find those papers politically objectionable , but instead would more likely cite a worse fault for media : blandness and incompleteness . Readers do expect coverage of the day , and those that don \u2019 t provide it don \u2019 t deserve reader support . ( Consider , for instance , the 22 percent of U.S. dailies that didn \u2019 t feel the mass protest of millions deserved play on their front pages . )\nThis is the new virtuous circle that must be spun , and quickly : Readers hold news media accountable for covering the news , and news media hold the power centers of their nation , states , and communities accountable for their actions . Spin the wheel faster , and more money will fall out , paying more and more journalists to do their jobs . Call it a pipe dream if you wish ; I call it a necessity .\nAt this point , it seems clear that without reader revenue , we \u2019 re likely to see a robust local press continue to wither away toward extinction . 2017 witnesses a convergence of severe financial pressures and intense press demonization , led by the new president . In a nation in which the press and broadcasters represent a thin line between partisan propaganda and citizen-readers , the time for action \u2014 new action \u2014 is now .\nPress critic Jay Rosen \u2019 s brutal realism \u2014 \u201c Winter is coming : Prospects for the American press under Trump \u201d \u2014 seems more prescient each day as working journalists are charged with felonies , multiple federal agencies are gagged , and the \u201c alternative fact \u201d war with the press looks to be an enduring affair . Comparisons to press crackdowns from Turkey to Venezuela to Russia , seemingly unimaginable six months ago , demand reading .\nWhat might this new asserted social contract look like ? I hope to be building it throughout the year \u2014 and your submissions are highly valued \u2014 but let \u2019 s start with five points of the moment :\nWhen the bear appears in the wilderness , you don \u2019 t curl up in a ball ; you make yourself seem as large as you can . The press needs to do that . In addition , subscribers are more willing to pay for strength \u2014 that day-after-day demonstration of news values \u2014 than to weak appeals for support . Assert the strength of the news product \u2014 and how your subscription can make it stronger .\nWishful thinking also won \u2019 t work . Earlier this week , some journalists noted how new White House spokesman Sean Spicer behaved on Monday as compared to Saturday , saying the shift might herald the long-awaited political pivot . Journalists who make too much of kinder words here and there and don \u2019 t stay focused on actions will be run over . Wesley Morris , The New York Times critic-at-large , deftly dissected a cousin of this wishful thinking ( \u201c Politics \u2019 newest empty gesture , the disavowal \u201d ) , appropriately decrying \u201c political language used in such a bloodless , begrudging way that it \u2019 s borderline dangerous . \u201d\nEven before the raft of Trump initiatives launched this week , the infinity of news has weighed heavily on readers \u2019 minds , with the smartphone an accomplice . Now that overload can lead to a political overwhelming .\nAs Callum Borchers outlined in The Washington Post recently : \u201c The news overload is enough to make you want to throw your hands up \u2014 or , perhaps , use them to reach for a cold beverage and a remote control , with which you can escape the transition tornado by tuning in to back-to-back NFL playoff doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday . This is a near-perfect situation for Donald Trump . \u201d\nWe know solutions for overtaxed readers , in an age of digital and social news bounty : editing . That \u2019 s why newsletters have proven so valuable as a new news marketing tool . But news companies of all kinds can go farther . How about organizing Trump \u2019 s tweets into tables , searchable by date and topic , with the fact check alongside it , rather than only writing one fact-checked story after another , which for readers tend to disappear into the ether ? Various kinds of scorecards \u2014 we \u2019 ve seen beginning indications of them here and there \u2014 can help readers make sense of the change-in-policy chaos and change-in-law confusion that is yet to come . Tame transience by creating permanent searchable records , new variations on the old Times Topics pages and their cousins of an earlier generation .\nThe real-life implications for Americans , given the spate of policy/law changes , looks like it is going to be profound . Especially at the local level ( where , let \u2019 s remember , everyone lives ) , health care , environmental , education , and criminal justice impacts should be quite reportable . This week , via NPR \u2019 s All Things Considered , I heard the kind of report we need . NPR , in partnership with Phoenix \u2019 s KJZZ and Kaiser Health News , produced \u201c Arizona Children Could Lose Health Coverage Under Obamacare Repeal. \u201d In less than four minutes , it made human impacts clear .\nWe \u2019 ve all seen them , those stories \u2014 now multiplied by the fake-news feeding frenzy \u2014 of how many Americans believe \u201c facts \u201d that simply aren \u2019 t true , like \u201c vaccines have been shown to cause autism \u201d or \u201c President Obama was born in Kenya. \u201d How about publishers \u2014 again , nationally and locally \u2014 creating with polling partners a series of Ignorance Indexes , tracking over time how much community/nation ignorance has increased or decreased ?\nWe \u2019 d hope \u2014 one of our fundamental values , right ? \u2014 that as a learning species and nation , we could all agree that facts are important . Does that sound elitist or partisan , you know , asserting that facts are important ? Forget the noise . If factuality is one of those core values , double-down on it . And have some fun with it . Maybe show the comparative results of two groups : subscribers and non-subscribers .\nGiven the events of the day , would-be allies of the press are popping out of the woodwork . Meryl Streep \u2019 s Golden Globe call-out for the Committee to Protect Journalists ( now even more necessary , as six journalists have been charged with felonies related to Inauguration Day violence ) boosted CPJ donations 140 times normal . John Oliver \u2019 s summer appeal to support journalism clearly spurred some rush of subscription sign-ups . Publishers \u2014 who must earn support they receive \u2014 must ask who are the social influencers , local or national , who will get people to open their wallets , given the new realization that paying for news makes a difference ?
