    "content": "It was bound to be an eventful week for U.S. politics , with the impeachment trial of Donald Trump wrapping up the same week as the State of the Union . We got all that drama and then some , courtesy of the Iowa Democratic Caucuses and a faulty election app . It became a disastrous week for U.S. election integrity\u2026 and it \u2019 s only going to get worse .\nNo shortage of U.S. political news to follow this week , as all the major stories drove to the same unavoidable conclusion\u2014upcoming presidential elections in November will be considered the least legitimate by American voters in at least a century . Up until this week , conventional wisdom was that the biggest threat facing U.S. electoral legitimacy emanated from Russia ( and other foreign actors ) looking to actively interfere in the proceedings , from attempting to hack vote totals to purposely spreading fake news . But this was the week the American people should have woken up to the fact that the greatest threat to U.S. elections may well be from Americans themselves .\nBegin with impeachment . After much hemming and hawing , the Senate voted both to bypass the need for more witnesses and to acquit President Trump of his impeachment charges along party lines\u2026 save for GOP Senator Mitt Romney , who joined Democrats in voting to find Trump guilty of abuse of power ( though not of obstructing Congress ) . A Trump acquittal was always going to be a problem for Trump critics who believe Trump \u2019 s decision to leverage military aid into an investigation into his political rival clearly qualifies as \u201c treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors \u201d \u2014any Trump victory that follows would be inevitably tainted in their eyes . But deciding to forgo witnesses ( even when one , former national security adviser John Bolton , seems to have enough pertinent information to literally write a book ) only fuels more feelings of illegitimacy for the upcoming presidential elections . And the GOP approach to framing impeachment as a purely partisan attempt to overturn the 2016 election results ( Romney \u2019 s vote to convict notwithstanding ) was a smart bit of politicking that allows Republican senators to avoid engaging the evidence that had been mounting against Trump and simply focus on the process matters they took issue with\u2026 a tactic to keep Republican voters onside while at the same dinging Americans \u2019 faith in U.S. political processes more broadly .\nNow turn to Iowa . Iowa has long been in the crosshairs of critics arguing that a state as small , rural and white shouldn \u2019 t have such a prime position in the nominating calendar . It \u2019 s also been in the crosshairs for past missteps as well\u2014in 2012 , Romney was declared the winner of the Republican caucus by a slender 8 votes , only to have his victory officially reversed 16 days later in favor of Rick Santorum , though the damage to Santorum \u2019 s momentum was already done . 2016 proved to be a testy Iowa contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as well , which probably factored into some prominent Sanders supporters ( and possibly even campaign surrogates ) implying that the fix against him was in . And it didn \u2019 t help that prominent Trump surrogates like Donald Trump Jr. and Senator Lindsey Graham jumped at the opportunity to pile on the Democrats , fanning the flames of conspiracy theories by suggesting that the DNC is ( yet again , according to them ) conspiring to prevent Sanders taking the nomination . And all that was after multiple candidates tried to claim victory for themselves , the digital app for reporting the votes malfunctioned and delayed the results for days on end , and the chair of the Democratic National Committee called for a \u201c recanvass , \u201d only to be rebuffed by Iowa Democrats .\nAll of which is to say\u2014there are elements on both the Republican and Democratic side whose interest it is to erode the legitimacy of elections in a short-term play to gain votes for their preferred political candidate with long-term consequences to the legitimacy of U.S. elections and political processes going forward .\nThere \u2019 s more to come . Now that Trump has been acquitted , he \u2019 s emboldened to take even more aggressive and controversial political decisions . While Senator Susan Collins of Maine believed that Trump learned his lesson , Trump himself begs to differ ( forcing Collins to concede that her comments were more \u201c aspirational \u201d than anything else ) . And with the precedent set that this batch of GOP senators are highly unlikely to abandon him ( especially as elections draw nearer ) , Trump may well solicit other foreign actors to interfere on his behalf\u2014at this point , he \u2019 s facing his last election ever and has little to lose by doing so . The Trump team has proven it will go to great lengths to ensure that his conversations with other foreign leaders never see the light of day , which is a disaster at a time when more transparency is needed to renew confidence in the electoral process and the American public has grown numb to White House denials . And while Trump \u2019 s State of the Union speech steered clear of the divisive issue of impeachment , his post-impeachment press conference sans teleprompter served a reminder that the worry with Trump isn \u2019 t typically the scripted remarks\u2014it \u2019 s the ones he makes off the cuff\u2026 and he \u2019 ll be making plenty of those over the next few months .

Anti-establishment Democrats have long been railing against establishment politics , and can easily point to Trump \u2019 s acquittal as Exhibit A . Should Bernie Sanders fail to capture the Democratic nomination , in their mind they have Exhibit 1A . And if state Democratic parties screw up any more primaries , more mainstream Democrats will question the legitimacy of the process as well , fueled by GOP operatives who will seize the opportunity to show how inept the Democrats are , another short-term push for voters that ends up delegitimizing the overall American political process in the long run .\nAccording to a poll conducted by Ipsos and C-Span this past September , 46 percent of Americans have little to no confidence that November elections will be \u201c open and fair. \u201d This week \u2019 s developments won \u2019 t help .\nEurasia Group \u2019 s Top Risk # 1 for 2020 .
