    "content": "Back from its one-week July 4 recess , the Senate is zeroing in on student loans Wednesday , poised to take up bills addressing the interest rates on subsidized federal loans after a key rate doubled last week .\nAfter Congress refused to act last month , the rate borrowers pay on subsidized Stafford loans \u2013 which make up about 40 percent of federal education loans \u2013 doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1 .\nPressure is now mounting on Congress to come up with a fix before many student loans are issued later this summer , but the various sides appear unable to come together \u2013 even though they \u2019 re not too far apart on what they seem to want .\nEven the measure passed by House Republicans in May , which is criticized by most Democrats , isn \u2019 t too far from the plan in President Obama \u2019 s budget proposal . Both call for a long-term fix that would peg the interest rate to US Treasury borrowing rates .\nWithin Senate Democratic ranks , meanwhile , there is a strong split \u2013 epitomized Tuesday by dueling news conferences held by different factions of the party after a closed-door lunch .\nSome Senate Democrats , including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Thomas Carper of Delaware , along with Angus King of Maine , an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats , touted the bipartisan solution they \u2019 ve been pushing , which differs from the House Republican plan but which also would peg interest rates to the 10-year Treasury rate .\nBut Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats criticized that solution as well as the one from House Republicans .\n\u201c Speaker Boehner says the House has acted and the ball is in the Senate \u2019 s court . But Democrats can \u2019 t support a plan that would be worse for students than doing nothing at all , \u201d Senator Reid said in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday .\nReid and many other Senate Democrats favor once again passing a short-term fix \u2013 extending the 3.4 percent rate one more year , which they would pay for by changing some tax rules on certain retirement accounts .\nThey say such a short-term solution would enable them to focus on deeper , more systemic problems and long-term solutions to college affordability in the fall , when they take up the Higher Education Act . Others see it as Congress once again punting a thorny issue down the road rather than addressing it .\n\u201c Why should we have a political one-year fix for 2 million students and leave 9 million more paying rates that are higher than they should , 7 million of them middle-income students ? \u201d asked Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R ) of Tennessee , speaking to reporters after the lunch Tuesday . He was referring to the fact that the one-year extension would apply only to subsidized loans , while the bipartisan solution he supports would also lower interest rates , at least in the short term , for students getting unsubsidized federal loans as well .\nSome college finance experts say a short-term solution is unlikely to really encourage Congress to address bigger issues in the fall .\n\u201c If they push this off to the Higher Education Act reauthorization , then this issue will again dominate the conversation , and there are many other issues lawmakers need to tackle , \u201d says Jason Delisle , director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the New America Foundation , who hopes Congress will come up with a long-term solution for government-issued education loans .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to come up with anything different in the next year .
