But he returned to Chicago \u2019 s Northside missing something small but crucial : photo identification . With government offices closed in a statewide partial shutdown , he has no idea when he might get an ID .\nAlbuja used to work as a forklift operator for a printing company , a job he says was waiting for him when he finished his sentence . But someone in the human resources department broke the news that they couldn \u2019 t rehire him without valid identification .\n\u201c Every single job I apply to , every temp agency I go to , they say the same thing , \u201d Albuja said . \u201c Without the ID nobody can do nothing for me . This is the longest I \u2019 ve ever been without a job . It \u2019 s like they want you to go back to prison . \u201d\nAcross the country , in states such as California , New Jersey , Louisiana , Illinois , and Oregon , people coming home from prison during the coronavirus crisis are running into this seemingly simple but overwhelming dilemma : How do you get an official ID when almost every licensing office is closed ? And without an ID , how do you do anything ? Many said they are left in limbo , unable to get a job , find housing , open a bank account , or even access basic benefits without that essential document . It \u2019 s yet another way the COVID-19 crisis has made the already difficult process of re-entry nearly impossible .\nCoronavirus Coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic , criminal justice and immigration . Related Stories\n\u201c It \u2019 s so basic , it \u2019 s getting almost no attention , \u201d said Katherine Katcher , founder and executive director of Root and Rebound , a legal advocacy and reentry organization that works in California and South Carolina . \u201c This entire population of people have not been taken into consideration . \u201d\nOne Root and Rebound client , Vah Saechao , had the money to rent an apartment in Clovis , California , but says he was turned down by over 20 landlords because he couldn \u2019 t provide identification . In Los Angeles , Zakee Hutchison has asked his family to mail cash or gift cards to the transitional house where he \u2019 s living , as he can \u2019 t apply for jobs or even get a debit card right now .\n\u201c Trying to communicate with the DMV is like trying to talk to Martians on the moon , \u201d Hutchison said . \u201c It \u2019 s just impossible . \u201d\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles has moved most operations online , and opened some offices in early May . But any online system is a challenge for people with limited access to technology or little experience navigating the internet . Getting a new ID after a years-long sentence would require an in-person visit anyway , and the DMV \u2019 s website says \u201c new appointments are not currently available . \u201d\nIn an emailed statement , the California DMV said they work closely with state corrections officials to make sure people released from prison can access ID . Currently , individuals who are eligible for a reduced-fee or no-fee ID card can walk into one of the open offices without an appointment . To qualify , you need a waiver signed by a registered social service provider .\nEven if you can get in the door , though , the open offices are scattered throughout the state . \u201c The closest one to me is in a city called Santa Ana , which is 3 \u00bd hours by bus , \u201d said Joshua Snyder , who uses a walker to get around .\nIn Louisiana , the Office of Motor Vehicles was closed for two months before re-opening some in-person locations last week . One set to open outside New Orleans had to nix that plan the same morning , due to a potential COVID exposure . At another nearby office , people started lining up at 4 a.m. the day it was set to open , according to reentry service providers in the city .\nIn the meantime , social service providers are scrambling to find workarounds . The First 72+ , a reentry service provider in New Orleans , wanted to house recently released people in hotel rooms for two weeks , so they could quarantine before moving into longer-term housing .

To get a free , government-issued phone , clients need a food stamp card to prove financial need , Orians said .
