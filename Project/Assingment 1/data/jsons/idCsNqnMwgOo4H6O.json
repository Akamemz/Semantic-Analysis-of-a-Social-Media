    "content": "There comes a time in an actor \u2019 s life when they find themselves seated in the Dolby Theater for the 12th consecutive hour , and they are either working on their face of gracious defeat for when their name is not called out as a winner , or they are optimistically going over a victory speech in their head , ensuring they don \u2019 t forget this producer or that agent or that grip on stage . ( Or they are running around the bar , asking why the Academy can \u2019 t \u201c just do another \u2018 Shallow , \u2019 \u201d which is probably the only reason I have not been invited to the Oscars . ) On Sunday night , we got two excellent speeches from actors , and two less excellent ones : Brad Pitt and Laura Dern mixed the intimate with the courteous , thanking their famous families and famous co-stars and reflecting on lives spent in front of the camera . Lead acting winners Joaquin Phoenix and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger , however , had speeches of a different flavor up their sleeves .\nIt has been said , correctly and coincidentally by me , that Joe Pesci delivered the best-ever Oscar acceptance speech : \u201c It was my privilege . Thank you. \u201d But people keep winning Oscars , so people keep giving Oscar speeches . Today , in the glow of Parasite \u2019 s Best Picture win , we are gathered here to decipher two of the most puzzling acceptance speeches from the night : Zellweger accepting her award for playing Judy Garland in Judy , and Phoenix accepting his award for King of Comedy , Revisited , excuse me , that \u2019 d be Joker .\nThank you to the Academy . Thank you for inviting me here alongside one of the most special collaborations and meaningful experiences of my life .\nTranslation : Thank you for making me sit here , through three host-less hours of jokes and an Eminem performance , to take home this trophy .\nI \u2019 ve said it before , and I \u2019 m going to say it again . Cynthia , Scarlett , Charlize , Saoirse , I have to say , boy , it is an honor to be considered in your company .\nCongratulations to the other nominees ! I wish you the best , but at another awards show , during another year , on another stage , ideally when I am not also competing .\nDavid Livingstone , Cameron McCracken , director Rupert Gould , boy , it was a privilege to work with you . I feel so proud to be in your beautiful movie .\nIt \u2019 s around this point in every Ren\u00e9e Zellweger speech where you raise your eyebrows and remember , Oh right , she really does just have that Southern accent .\nI \u2019 ve got ta thank my stage moms , Matt and Jeff and Eric , Paul , Gary , Jessie Buckley , Finn Wittrock , Rufus Sewell , all the cast and the crew who worked so hard on this film to celebrate Judy Garland . My extended family at CAA , Peter , Brian , and Kevin . Imprint , Nicole and Dom .\nA light Lou Bega riff for your Oscar night : A little bit of Matt in my life/ A little bit of Jeff by my side/ A little bit of Eric is all I need/ A little bit of Paul is what I see /A little bit of Gary in the sun /A little bit of Jessie all night long A little bit of Finn here I am / A little bit of you makes me your \u2026 Best Lead Actress winner !\nNanci Ryder , thank you for the 25 years . John Carrabino , my handsome date of 25 years . Thank you for always dreaming bigger than I would dare and for bringing it back to the work and joy and gratitude . My immigrant folks who came here with nothing but each other and a belief in the American dream . How about this ?\nRen\u00e9e Zelleweger has had the same team \u2014 manager and publicist \u2014 for literally as long as Sir Shaw Ronan has been alive . That \u2019 s showbiz , kid !\nThank you to you big brother Drew , Brandy , Judy , Stone , and Eva for all the love , all the love and support possible that makes you believe anything is possible .\nThey \u2019 ll push your buttons ! /They \u2019 ll make you wan na Hug \u2018 em/A family/A family/Proud , Proud family !\nI have to say that this past year of conversations celebrating Judy Garland across genders and \u2026 I \u2019 m sorry , it \u2019 s across generations and across cultures has been a really cool reminder that our heroes unite us .\nNo , the best among us who inspire us to find the best in ourselves . They unite us . When we look to our heroes , we agree , and that matters . Neil Armstrong , Sally Ride , Dolores Huerta , Venus and Serena and Selena , Bob Dylan , Scorsese , Fred Rogers , Harriet Tubman .\nI know how you started out this night . You were desperate for someone to speak the names of Venus and Serena Williams , Sally Ride , and Martin Scorsese in the same sentence . You didn \u2019 t think it could happen . In fact , you were sure they couldn \u2019 t pull it off . You put money on this . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is 84 percent white , it \u2019 s 68 percent male . There \u2019 s no way I \u2019 m getting Venus and Serena and Selena in the same sentence . But look what Ren\u00e9e Zellweger did . That !\nWe agree on our teachers , and we agree on our courageous men and women in uniform who serve . We agree on our first responders and firefighters . When we celebrate our heroes , we \u2019 re reminded of who we are as one people united .\n[ Utterly random , sorry , I don \u2019 t know what in the name of a TEDx talk this means . ]\nNo , Judy Garland did not receive this honor in her time . I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy that began on our film set .\nBasically : Y \u2019 all are giving this to me because you clowns never gave it to her .

( I bet you \u2019 d forgotten that \u201c Same Love , \u201d was a popular Macklemore song in 2012 . That song was most assuredly not about the love of film . )\nI don \u2019 t know what I \u2019 d be without it .

I think , whether we \u2019 re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights , we \u2019 re talking about the fight against injustice . We \u2019 re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation , one people , one race , one gender or one species has the right to dominate , control and use and exploit another with impunity .\nNooooo don \u2019 t equate veganism with anti-racism \u2014 these issues are fundamentally different ! \u2014 your so sexy aha .\nI think that we \u2019 ve become very disconnected from the natural world , and many of us , what we \u2019 re guilty of is an egocentric worldview \u2014 the belief that we \u2019 re the center of the universe .
