    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nRegarding the discussion about automation , \u201c Study after study is published every year warning the public about the looming threat of robots . The McKinsey consulting firm estimates that automation could kill 73 million US jobs in the next 10 years . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) estimates 13.6 million lost US jobs . Nearly a dozen separate studies say it could be anywhere from 3 million to 80 million . That \u2019 s a huge difference\u2026 will a quarter of all US jobs really disappear , as one of the debate moderators suggested ? No one has a damn clue . \u201d Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez Campbell , Vox\n\u201c Last week , an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that a plurality believe Trump has worsened the nation \u2019 s security . And the poll was conducted mostly before Trump gave a green light to Turkey \u2019 s invasion of northern Syria\u2026 For several decades \u2014 since the early Cold War , really \u2014 Republicans have usually been able to convince the country that they were the ones to be trusted to keep Americans safe . But , as with so much else , President Trump has squandered that durable advantage\u2026 [ and ] left an enormous opening for Democrats to establish themselves as the champions of national security . \u201d Dana Milbank , Washington Post\n\u201c A great fun fact about Pete Buttigieg is that he once won a \u2018 Profiles in Courage \u2019 essay contest in high school with a piece celebrating his political hero : Sanders . And while the two are clearly running in different lanes in 2020 , they have gone through a similar experience as candidates . Sanders began 2016 as a protest candidate , only partway through realizing that he could actually , truly win the whole shebang . He had to pivot from being a gadfly to a plausible nominee\u2026 [ Buttigieg now has ] to make the same pivot\u2026 \u201c He \u2019 s running as an Indiana pragmatist , not the heir to Sanders \u2019 s legacy his teenage self would \u2019 ve been excited about . And while this surely annoys Beto O \u2019 Rourke and Amy Klobuchar , he is the candidate in that lane with the most fundraising prowess and the most plausible path to the nomination in the polling ( especially in Iowa , where he \u2019 s in fourth , but not that far down from first ) . If Biden fades out , Buttigieg stands to take his place . \u201d Dylan Matthews , Vox\n\u201c If there was any doubt that Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , Pete Buttigieg , Amy Klobuchar , and Beto O \u2019 Rourke cleared that up pretty quickly tonight\u2026 \u201c The tenor of the critiques Warren received tonight were far milder versions of the attacks she \u2019 ll have to fend off from Republicans if she \u2019 s the nominee\u2014that her unabashedly progressive agenda will turn off middle-of-the-road voters , that the candidate who boasts about all her plans is being evasive about her most far-reaching proposal . How she responds over the next few months might well determine whether she keeps her perch atop the primary race . But for Warren , being the target of everyone \u2019 s rhetorical fire is undoubtedly a good problem to have. \u201d Russell Berman , The Atlantic\n\u201c Focusing a conversation about America \u2019 s deeply messed up , unaffordable and unfair health care system with a \u2018 gotcha \u2019 question about whether fixing it would require tax increases serves no one other than moderators looking to frame progressive proposals entirely around their costs\u2026 no serious person can claim the government wouldn \u2019 t need to raise money to finance a single-payer system\u2026 \u201c The real question is who would pay those taxes and how the burden of new taxes would compare to what American households are currently paying in premiums , co-payments and care their insurance plans don \u2019 t cover at all . And that \u2019 s to say nothing of the millions of uninsured Americans , who today face unlimited costs when they get sick or injured. \u201d Jeffrey Young , Huffington Post\n\u201c Now , it is true that instituting universal health-care coverage would cost a lot of money and require raising taxes . But it \u2019 s also true , as Warren ( and Sanders ) keep trying to remind everyone , that\u2026 it would save the U.S. money on health care overall , because it would eliminate or cut back on the many types of medical spending that currently come out of consumers \u2019 pockets . As they could possibly do a betterjob pointing out , universal-coverage systems , rather than being crazy hypotheticals that exist only on paper , have been implemented in America-like countries like Canada and the U.K. without inducing society-ruining catastrophes. \u201d Ben Mathis-Lilley , Slate\nThe right believes Buttigieg and Klobuchar had a good night , and criticizes Warren \u2019 s response on healthcare .\nThe right believes Buttigieg and Klobuchar had a good night , and criticizes Warren \u2019 s response on healthcare .\n\u201c Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out\u2026 [ Klobuchar ] was lively , common-sense , and pugnacious , particularly with Warren . Most of the other candidates are now in the state where they \u2019 re terrified of telling any primary voters anything they don \u2019 t want to hear , so they promise all things to all people , and that none of it will require any sacrifices or offsets . The corny humor and jokes about nagging her daughter would probably work in a general-election battle in the Midwest\u2026\n\u201c Buttigieg has always turned in well-prepared performances ; if his previous nights had any problem , it was that they were smooth to the point of slickness ; he still has that vibe of listening to a presentation from McKinsey Consulting . But if tonight was the pressure night for most of the second tier , with other candidates eager to promise the moon , Buttigieg seemed like the relaxed voice of reason\u2026 Every candidate tries to tell personal stories about what shaped their values , but Buttigieg does this better than most with his discussion of growing up in South Bend and serving in Afghanistan . \u201d\n\u201c [ Buttigieg ] was calm but resolved . America 's word matters greatly not simply for its moral essence , but for the strategic understanding that word proffers in others . The understanding of enemies that America is challenged at one 's peril . The understanding of allies that America is a force to align with in pursuit of a better future . The understanding of neutral nations that America is a nation to respect\u2026 Buttigieg was also right about something else , something too many on the Left and Right ignore or pretend to ignore : the basic truth that there is a foreign policy middle road between endless war and total withdrawal from the world\u2026\n\u201c His plans deserve close scrutiny . Chinese anti-ship missiles and Russian air defense bubbles wo n't be defeated by a larger foreign aid budget and nicely tinged calls to peace . And it must be said that Democrats do not have as supreme a record on foreign policy as they presently wish to presume . Trump 's predecessor was weak on China and weak on Russia . Those nations rose in threat to America thanks to the space President Barack Obama gave them . Still , Buttigieg deserves credit for speaking plainly about the importance of American leadership . Without that leadership the world would be poorer , less free , and less safe . \u201d\n\u201c Joe Biden was , once again , seemingly left alone for the most part . Up until the end of the debate , he wasn \u2019 t really hit too hard , and even after the divisions over Medicare For All , Biden \u2019 s record in the Senate and as Vice President , and a rather chauvinist attempt to take credit for Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s time as head of the consumer finance agency she touted as a major accomplishment , Biden still stood tall . The problem is that all of this happened to Biden as an afterthought . Everyone was focused on Warren . Everyone was worried about Sanders \u2019 health . Everyone was looking for Buttigieg and others to step up . And no one really cared how well Biden did . That is a bad thing for him . \u201d\n\u201c Sen . Elizabeth Warren deservedly drew heat from several rivals over her stubborn refusal to acknowledge that implementing a $ 32 trillion plan to provide free health insurance to everybody would require increasing middle-class taxes\u2026 She 's trying to make the case that because middle-class Americans would be getting free healthcare , their costs would go down overall\u2026\n\u201c [ But ] it 's one thing to argue that people are getting a better deal by sending money to the government in exchange for services . It 's another to refuse to acknowledge they are paying taxes . For instance , people may believe that paying property taxes and sending their kids to public school is a good deal on net . But they still think of property taxes as taxes and increases in property taxes as tax increases\u2026\n\u201c Even looking at things on a net tradeoff basis , however , Warren 's numbers [ on healthcare ] do n't add up . An analysis of the 2016 Sanders campaign proposal from the liberal Urban Institute\u2026 found that the plan would increase overall health spending in the U.S by $ 6.6 trillion over a decade . The largest revenue raiser Warren has proposed during her campaign is a $ 2.75 trillion wealth tax , or less than half this amount\u2026 The clearest proof that middle-class taxes will have to go up is that other countries with socialized health insurance systems along the lines of what Warren is advocating have higher middle-class taxes than the U.S . \u201d\nRegarding her candidacy as a whole , \u201c Warren seems to have concluded that if a rule-breaking candidate like Donald Trump can be elected president , then the old political rules don \u2019 t apply any more . So she has endorsed Medicare for All and backs eliminating private health insurance ; she has said she \u2019 d ban fracking for oil and natural gas ; she supports decriminalizing illegal border crossing , health care for illegal immigrants who get across , and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves\u2026\n\u201c Warren obviously hopes that her calls for federal oversight of large corporations and her call for a 2 % wealth tax on multimillionaires will resonate with non-affluent Trump voters . But those voters seem more concerned with elites \u2019 political correctness than convinced that Warren \u2019 s proposal will send their way any money somehow mulcted from corporations\u2026 \u200d `` This is not to say that Warren is a sure loser . Any Democratic nominee has a serious chance of beating Donald Trump . But it says something interesting about the Democratic Party that its current top three are in their 70 's and all from overwhelmingly Democratic states . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
