He increased that to 71 % this year .\nLatinos were crucial in helping Obama win the battleground states of Colorado and Nevada , and in putting the president in the lead for Florida 's 29 electoral votes .

Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night .\n2 . The youth vote came up big \u2014 and the white vote got smaller\nA big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls .\nAccording to national exit polls , 18-29 year olds increased from 17 % to 18 % of the electorate from 2004 to 2008 . They made up 19 % of the electorate this time around . That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president 's drop in capturing the youth vote , from 66 % in 2008 to 60 % in 2012 .\nIt was n't just age , but also race , that worked in the president 's favor .\nObama 's share of the white vote dropped from 43 % four years ago to 39 % this year . But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74 % of the electorate four years ago to 72 % now . And the African-American percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13 % . Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74 % for Romney to win .\n`` The youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that 's to the president 's credit , '' Fleischer said .\n3 . The auto bailouts helped drive Obama to victory in Ohio\nFor months , the Obama campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler , and they were given prominent prime-time placement during the Democratic National Convention in early September . It 's a strategy that the Obama campaign thought could be the difference in Ohio , a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election .\n`` The American auto industry is back on top , '' Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State .\nThe bailouts were started under President George W. Bush in 2008 but Obama grabbed the keys to the program the next year , managing and funding the assistance .\nRomney opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers . The Obama campaign and other Democrats have attacked Romney over his opposition to the federal intervention , which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies .\nAnd in the final weeks leading up the the election , the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China .\nIt seemed to work . Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government 's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers , and according to exit polls , the president won three quarters of those voters .\nMuch was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan , to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election , and Romney 's return to the Keystone State on Election Day . The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads .\nTo a lesser degree , there was a similar push in Minnesota , another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month .\nThere was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map .\nWhile Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota , it was n't enough . And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago , it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again .\nWe had a Democratic president , a Republican House of Representatives , and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election . And we 'll have a Democrat in the White House , with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election .\nWhen all the bills are in , total spending for the 2012 election ( all federal and state races ) could top a record-breaking $ 6 billion .

Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night.\n\n2. The youth vote came up big \u2014 and the white vote got smaller\n\nA big question heading into Election Day was whether younger voters would show up at the polls.\n\nMore of them did than last time.\n\nAccording to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008. They made up 19% of the electorate this time around. That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president's drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012.\n\nIt wasn't just age, but also race, that worked in the president's favor.\n\nObama's share of the white vote dropped from 43% four years ago to 39% this year.

Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters.\n\n4. Romney wasn't able to expand the map\n\nMuch was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney's return to the Keystone State on Election Day. The Romney campaign and allied super PACs supporting the GOP nominee flooded Pennsylvania airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads.\n\nTo a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month.\n\nThere was talk by Romney campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map.\n\nIt didn't pan out.\n\nWhile Romney performed stronger than 2008 Republican nominee John McCain in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it wasn't enough. And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again.\n\n5. What will $6 billion get you?\n\nWe had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election. And we'll have a Democrat in the White House, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate after the election.\n\nWhen all the bills are in, total spending for the 2012 election (all federal and state races) could top a record-breaking $6 billion. And what did all that money buy?\n\nSome would argue ... nothing.",
