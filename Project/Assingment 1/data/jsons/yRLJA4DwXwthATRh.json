''\nThis is what we 've come to : the rich businessman on his yacht feels out of the loop , because campaigns only care about billionaires .\nWith attempts to regulate spending in tatters , and unlimited donations now permitted to flow into and out of Super PACs and outside groups , campaigns are increasingly spending their time wooing the absolute richest of the rich .\nAnd according to Gold and Hamburger , donors who are merely rich , but not mega-rich , are feeling neglected .

'' Head over and read the full , excellent piece .\nBut it did n't always work this way . Back before Citizens United v.

Because of these contribution limits , presidential campaigns were particularly reliant on star fundraisers called `` bundlers , '' who could convince many of their rich friends to cough up several thousand bucks each .\nBut Super PACs that can raise unlimited sums have changed the math .
