For months , the connection he has made with his core audience \u2013 in some cases , through those very qualities \u2013 has limited any damage .\nBut now , with only two other competitors left in the race and Trump urgently needing 1,237 delegates to avoid a contested convention in which the party will be aligned against him , his clairaudience isn \u2019 t enough . So far , he 's won fewer than 50 percent of the delegates on offer ; to get to 1,237 , he 'll need to win more than 60 percent of those remaining .

What \u2019 s your solution ? \u201d\nUntil this week , Trump has been able to successfully run a primary campaign on such broad policy prescriptions ( or none at all ) because of his celebrity , his tell-it-like-it-is style , and the fact that there were so many candidates in the race \u2013 candidates who mostly fought each other , not him .\n\u201c With 17 candidates running , there \u2019 s not enough time to force details on tax cuts or whatever your foreign policy is , \u201d says Mackowiak . \u201c Now we \u2019 re down to three candidates and there \u2019 s more of a requirement for specificity . \u201d\nAs that dynamic has changed , however , Trump has not grown as a `` credible nominee , '' Mr. Mackowiak argues .
