    "content": "As Covid-19 began spreading across the African continent in late March , the U.S. State Department took to Twitter to boast about American health assistance there . A March 25 tweet from the department highlighted more than $ 100 million in U.S. medical assistance to foreign countries , including in Africa , as evidence of America \u2019 s emphasis on mitigating \u201c endemic and emerging health threats \u201d and its \u201c long-term investment in the lives of Africans. \u201d When it comes to Africa , the messaging suggests , America \u2019 s focus is on saving lives , not ending them . But a wealth of evidence reveals that the opposite is true in the two African countries of greatest interest to the U.S. military : Libya and Somalia .\nSince U.S. Africa Command became fully operational in 2008 , American troops have seen combat in more than a dozen African countries and conducted more than 1,500 air attacks , commando raids , and other ground missions in Libya and Somalia alone . Yet these two countries , where U.S. forces have spent hundreds of millions on airstrikes , have fared especially poorly in terms of direct U.S. health assistance . Libya and Somalia are also the only two African countries where the U.S. stands accused of killing civilians and failing to take responsibility for their deaths . \u201c This sends an appalling message to the citizens of those countries \u2014 namely , that the U.S. cares more about propping up their governments than about helping people suffering on the ground there , \u201d said Daphne Eviatar , director of the Security with Human Rights program at Amnesty International USA . \u201c The irony is that message will only encourage ill will toward the United States and U.S. forces , and ultimately fuel support for the armed groups the U.S. is fighting. \u201d The U.S. military has sought to portray AFRICOM as something more akin to the Peace Corps than a geographic combatant command like Central Command , which oversees U.S. military operations and war-making across the Greater Middle East . A parade of top generals and boosters have promoted the idea that AFRICOM would wield soft power through a \u201c whole-of-government \u201d approach , partnering with civilian agencies to \u201c advance U.S. national interests \u201d on the African continent . As a \u201c hybrid \u201d command , officials vowed , it would stand apart from its war-fighting brethren and approach its corner of the world differently . \u201c It is , at its heart , a different kind of command with a different orientation , \u201d said then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates at AFRICOM \u2019 s inauguration in 2008 , stressing that it would forge \u201c civilian-military partnerships. \u201d Earlier this year , in testimony before members of the House Appropriations Committee , AFRICOM \u2019 s chief , Gen. Stephen Townsend , was still touting the command \u2019 s \u201c whole-of-government \u201d mindset . Problems like Covid-19 \u201c don \u2019 t really have military solutions \u201d and necessitate working with partners like the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development , Townsend said in March . Two weeks later , the State Department \u2019 s Africa Media Hub tweeted about America \u2019 s focus on helping , rather than harming , Africans . The tweet was accompanied by a color-coded map showing which African countries have received the most direct \u201c global health assistance \u201d from the United States since 2001 .\nThe U.S. has offered over $ 100 million in medical assistance to foreign countries , incl . # African nations , to combat # COVID19 . @ USAID has invested over $ 1.1 billion dollars since 2009 to prevent , detect , & respond to endemic & emerging health threats . https : //t.co/jZNfi5kn6M pic.twitter.com/1YClIwtLkp \u2014 US Africa Media Hub ( @ AfricaMediaHub ) March 25 , 2020\nIn April , the Africa Media Hub tweeted out an enhanced version of the map that included U.S.-funded national reference laboratories , whose core functions include supporting disease diagnosis and surveillance , as well as investigating outbreaks . The maps demonstrate that when it comes to the most militarily important countries on the continent , America \u2019 s synergistic whole-of-government approach to wielding soft power to achieve national security goals is more fantasy than reality .\nThe U.S. Govt is leading the world \u2019 s humanitarian & health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic . U.S. govt agencies are working together to prioritize foreign assistance based on coordination & the potential for impact . More info : https : //t.co/oiX1Rk7aEw pic.twitter.com/7u0guKmney \u2014 US Africa Media Hub ( @ AfricaMediaHub ) April 10 , 2020\nAFRICOM engages in six \u201c lines of effort \u201d \u2014 primary objectives to be accomplished over years of sustained military operations . Most , such as \u201c strengthen partner networks , \u201d relate to general undertakings , but two target individual African nations : \u201c Develop security in Somalia \u201d and \u201c Contain instability in Libya. \u201d Of at least 13 African countries where U.S. forces have engaged in combat in the last decade , these nations have seen the U.S. military \u2019 s most intense ( Libya ) and sustained ( Somalia ) attacks . The State Department maps also show that these two countries have received among the least U.S. health aid on the continent : less than $ 500,000 for Libya and between $ 500,000 and $ 99 million for Somalia . Since 9/11 , the U.S. has carried out more attacks in Libya , targeting militants associated with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State , than anywhere but the war zones of the Greater Middle East . The United States has conducted no fewer than 776 airstrikes \u2014 and likely far more \u2014 in the North African nation from 2011 to the present , according to figures provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by retired Air Force squadron commander Lt. Col. Gary Peppers and by Airwars , a U.K.-based airstrike monitoring group . The bulk of those attacks occurred during the Obama administration , which launched the first large spate of strikes in 2011 to support the rebels who ultimately ousted then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . That war shattered the Libyan state and turned the country into a haven for Islamist militants , leading to another surge in U.S. strikes in 2016 . That summer , the fledgling post-Gaddafi regime \u2014 the Libyan Government of National Accord \u2014 asked for American help in dislodging ISIS fighters from Sirte . The Obama administration designated the city an \u201c area of active hostilities , \u201d loosening guidelines designed to prevent civilian casualties and allowing the U.S. military a freer hand in carrying out airstrikes . Between August and December 2016 , according to a statement from AFRICOM , the U.S. carried out \u201c 495 precision airstrikes \u201d in the city .\nIn 2011 , President Barack Obama pledged that the United States would \u201c work with the international community to provide assistance to the people of Libya , who need food for the hungry and medical care for the wounded. \u201d Almost a decade later , medical care remains a challenge for Libyans because , according to USAID , \u201c a substantial proportion of health facilities [ are ] only partially operational or closed. \u201d The State Department \u2019 s recently tweeted maps highlight one of the reasons : almost nonexistent U.S. support . Libya is one of only two countries to receive so little in direct American health assistance , according to government figures . ( The other is Tunisia , where U.S. troops have also been involved in combat in recent years , but whose relative stability sets it apart from its neighbor Libya . ) While the U.S. military has carried out more airstrikes in Libya , Somalia is the site of America \u2019 s longest-running air campaign outside the CENTCOM area of operations \u2014 and that war is escalating at an exponential rate under the Trump administration . The United States has carried out more than 220 attacks in Somalia since 2007 , primarily aimed at the terrorist group al-Shabab . There have already been more U.S. airstrikes in Somalia in 2020 than there were declared attacks by AFRICOM during the entire Obama presidency . Add ground operations , and the number of total U.S. attacks in Somalia would be even higher , according to retired Brig . Gen. Donald Bolduc , who served as commander of Special Operations Command Africa from April 2015 to June 2017 , and Air Force files obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 via the Freedom of Information Act . There has been much speculation about U.S. troop drawdowns in Africa , and Covid-19 has paused or curtailed U.S. military deployments around the globe . But the number of troops deployed in Somalia has hovered between 650 and 800 American personnel since last year , Manley said .\nTo house those forces and support hundreds of ground missions over the years , the U.S. military has built an archipelago of outposts and bases across the country . But experts say that what Somalia really needs are hospitals and clinics . According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , Somalia \u2019 s \u201c healthcare system is overburdened , fragmented , under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide lifesaving or preventive services. \u201d \u201c Somalia \u2019 s health indicators are among the worst in the world , \u201d the World Bank recently observed , \u201c and Covid-19 cases threaten to stretch a fragile healthcare system. \u201d \u201c I urge our donors \u2026 to invest in the future of Somalia through the health of its people , \u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari , the World Health Organization regional director for the eastern Mediterranean , said during a late 2019 visit to the country , where 3 million people are in need of health assistance .\nYet the United States has only invested $ 30 million in health assistance to Somalia over the last 19 years \u2014 less than it has given to 33 other countries on the continent , including Botswana ( $ 1.1 billion ) ; Eswatini ( $ 490 million ) ; Guinea ( $ 365.5 million ) ; Namibia ( $ 970.5 million ) ; and Zambia ( $ 3.9 billion ) . Those countries have received far less attention from the U.S. military \u2014 and no airstrikes . U.S. attacks in Somalia have killed as many as 142 civilians since 2007 and up to 82 in Libya since late 2011 , according to Airwars . Yet AFRICOM has admitted to killing only four civilians on the continent , two each in airstrikes in Somalia in 2018 and 2019 . Despite its whole-of-government rhetoric , AFRICOM \u2019 s failure to coordinate with the State Department and USAID was likely a key reason that Somali civilians have never received assistance , reparations , or compensation for deaths and injuries caused by U.S. airstrikes , Eviatar noted . \u201c AFRICOM \u2019 s minimal presence on the ground in Somalia is also the reason they give for being unable to adequately investigate claims of civilian casualties , and they \u2019 ve made no effort to coordinate with State or USAID to do so , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We are proud to stand by our partners as we battle this deadly virus in Africa and around the globe , \u201d U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. James Vechery , AFRICOM \u2019 s deputy chief , said recently as the command drew attention to training and equipment provided to four African nations to enable them to set up and operate mobile hospitals . \u201c The effort highlights a whole-of-government approach , aimed at ensuring African partners are educated , resourced , and supported to contain the spread of the virus , \u201d reads a recent AFRICOM news release . But neither Somalia nor Libya , nor any of the other 11 nations where the U.S. has been engaged in combat in recent years , received any of that assistance .\nThe second version of the State Department \u2019 s Global Health Assistance map was accompanied by the claims that that the United States is \u201c leading the world \u2019 s humanitarian & health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic \u201d and that U.S. investment in Africa \u201c increases local access to and delivery of health services. \u201d This map , too , spotlights the neglect for the \u201c delivery of health services \u201d in countries that have borne the brunt of American attacks . Of the 29 national reference laboratories supported by PEPFAR , the President \u2019 s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , not one is located in either Libya or Somalia . In fact , only five of the 29 labs can be found in countries where the United States has been engaged in combat in recent years : two in Kenya and one each in Cameroon , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and South Sudan . In March , USAID announced an initial commitment of $ 37 million from its Emergency Reserve Fund for Contagious Infectious Diseases for 25 \u201c high-priority countries. \u201d Only seven of them were in Africa , and they did not include Libya or Somalia . Only one \u2014 Kenya \u2014 was the site of recent U.S. combat . Last month , the State Department and USAID announced nearly $ 508 million in emergency health , humanitarian , and economic assistance to \u201c support critical activities to control the spread \u201d of the coronavirus . Together , Libya and Somalia are receiving 3.6 percent of the total Covid-19 response funds , or $ 18.6 million . By comparison , Italy \u2014 which has a far more robust health care system than either nation and hasn \u2019 t borne U.S. attacks since the 1940s \u2014 will receive $ 50 million . Other contemporary U.S. battlegrounds include Afghanistan ( more than $ 18 million ) ; Iraq ( more than $ 25.6 million ) ; and Syria ( almost $ 18 million ) . All of those countries outpaced Libya ( $ 6 million ) and Somalia ( nearly $ 12.5 million ) . The U.S. has since announced an additional $ 4 million in Covid-19 assistance for Somalia , but seemingly none for Libya .",
