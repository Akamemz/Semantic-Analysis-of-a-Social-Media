    "content": "In 2015 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 talked to Secretary Perez about how social change happens \u2014 and the role played not just by government and activists , but by individual interactions between people , and by the slow , relentless force of demographics and history . This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length .\nPerez 's track record has made him something of a lightning rod for the right : when he was nominated for labor secretary , then\u2013Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called him `` a crusading ideologue whose convictions lead him to believe that the law simply does n't apply to him . ''\nHis office reflects the importance of both insiders and outsiders : the picture behind his desk is of former Labor Secretary Frances Perkins , the namesake of the building where the department is headquartered , but the picture in the anteroom outside his office is of labor leader and activist Cesar Chavez .\nAt the same time , he 's a close ally of Democratic politicians ; he 's spent time campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary , and is sometimes mentioned as a possible VP pick if Clinton wins the nomination .\nPerez has spent the majority of his career inside government , from the staff of Senator Ted Kennedy to the council of Montgomery County , Maryland . But he 's always been closely aligned with activists and movements outside of the government . For a time , he was president of the board of directors of CASA de Maryland , a leading immigration advocacy group ; even when he has n't had an official title , he 's worked closely with LGBT organizations , civil rights groups , and labor unions .\nProgressive activists have n't always loved Democratic presidents , and they certainly have n't always loved President Obama . At times they 've been deeply frustrated with the president and his White House . But at least one senior administration official has remained a progressive hero throughout the entirety of Obama 's presidency : Thomas Perez , who ran the Department of Justice 's Civil Rights Division during the president 's first term and has served as secretary of labor since 2013 .\nWhat role does government play in social change ? Dara Lind : I think progressives feel a lot of ownership in having you here in the Perkins Building . Tom Perez : That 's why her portrait is right behind my back \u2014 because she 's the gold standard . Dara Lind : Over the course of your career , you 've been working very closely with a lot of movements , but mostly from the inside . The big question I want an answer to is what role you think government plays in social change . Do you see this role as primarily leading public opinion and instituting things that people can then catch up to ? Or is it mostly responsive to people who are already organizing on the ground and demanding that government respond ? More \u2588\u2588\u2588 interviews\nJim Webb Paul Krugman Peter Thiel Tom Perez : I 'm a student of history . When you look at the history of any successful movement , it 's always been a partnership . By partnership , I mean there are external forces at work . Also in the anatomy of every successful movement that has resulted in change , whether it 's the Civil Rights Act of '64 or the Voting Rights Act of '65 or movements before that \u2014 the Fair Labor Standards Act , under FDR , for example . You look at the work of Frances Perkins leading up to the Fair Labor Standards Act , and you look at the work of the external labor movement at that point . And I talk about civil rights and labor rights ; I mean , the March on Washington was a march for civil rights and a march for labor rights . Each one of those forces is indispensable to the movement . They \u2019 re all really links on a chain . And when you break a link , the chain can be broken . Dara Lind : How have you seen these kinds of partnerships play out over the course of your career ? Tom Perez : We had a living-wage movement in Montgomery County , and it would not have been successful without progressive businesses , without grass-roots leadership and faith leaders , and without folks inside Montgomery County government who said , `` This is the right thing to do . '' Or moving the needle on the Hate Crimes Bill , for instance \u2014 which was , for me , a 15-year odyssey . I can tell you a lot about that one , because I really did had a front-row seat on that . Who is more responsible ? I 'll let historians judge that . But I think I can say , fairly , that it was all of us working together . And if you did n't have the inside-government person , you would n't have gotten it done . What happens when activists are frustrated with their allies inside government ? Dara Lind : In hindsight , throughout history , it often seems there 's a partnership between inside and outside . In the moment , there can be tensions . I think both of us have seen this recently , with the immigrant rights movement and the administration leading up to the executive actions in November . Tom Perez : Oh , sure . And there were tensions in the hate-crimes bill . There was tension during the drafting : there are existing death penalty provisions , and what do you do about that ? Those are fair questions . Those are important questions . The immigrant-rights movement \u2014 believe me , these are my very , very good friends . \u2026 That does n't mean , even when you know you have shared values and shared vision , that we have n't had pitched battles . And it does n't mean that at the end of the day we do n't come out with a very clear vision of where to go forward , and sometimes you do n't agree at the end . But I think we \u2019 re in a good place right now . Dara Lind : In cases where there is direct pressure on the people who are friends of the movement , when have you seen that kind of pressure be effective in spurring them to do better ? When have you seen it entrench attitudes and make people feel underappreciated ? Tom Perez : I consider myself a pretty passionate person , but I have always tried hard not to personalize things . In the heat of the moment , at times , that 's easier said than done , so I think it 's really important to keep that in mind . In every debate I had when I was at the County Council , I saw folks on the left and folks on the right who 'd do this : when they disagree with you , they also disagree with who you are . They add , `` You 're morally bankrupt , '' or something like that . And , you know , we just have different visions of America at times when we see things differently . One thing I learned from Senator Kennedy , and from Senator Paul Simon , and others whom I watched firsthand as a staffer , was that you can disagree without being disagreeable . You can be passionate in your views , but you 've got to remember that you have got to work with folks . If you 're attacking their integrity as opposed to attacking their point of view on an issue , it just makes it harder to get to the finish line . I think people understand that . But people are human . And as a result , sometimes we do things that perhaps do n't move the ball forward .\nDara Lind : The president \u2019 s made some substantial changes recently through executive action \u2014 on immigration , for example , or raising the minimum wage for federal contractors . There \u2019 s often a belief in DC that changing policy through the executive branch isn \u2019 t as permanent as getting it done through legislation or waiting for public opinion to come around . Do you feel that 's a concern ? Or do you feel that changes like this set a standard that society will then rise to meet ? Tom Perez : I see them as both . When I look back on the most important civil rights developments in the last hundred years , in the top three for me would be President Truman 's executive order integrating the Armed Forces . And I could n't help but note the parallels in rhetoric with some opponents when he did that , and when we were talking about `` Do n't ask , do n't tell , '' \u2014 `` military readiness , '' and this and that . I had a trial down in Texas when I was prosecuting hate crimes . It was a horrible hate-crime case . I got to be good friends with the attorney for one of the defendants , and he 's a World War II veteran . He said once that he grew up in the segregated South , he grew up with attitudes about African Americans , and the singular thing that changed his life was when he fought side by side with them . So I think executive action can be transformational . What is DACA ? The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , or DACA , has been in place since 2012 . The program applies to many of the `` DREAMers '' : young unauthorized immigrants who would have qualified for legalization under the DREAM Act . Under the current DACA program , young unauthorized immigrants who meet certain criteria apply for two years of protection from deportation ( it 's going to be extended to three years under the new set of orders ) , and can get work permits once they 've been `` DACAmented . '' An estimated 1.2 million immigrants were initially eligible for the program , and about half of them have actually applied . Read this \u2588\u2588\u2588 feature for more about how well DACA has worked so far . There 's no substitute for comprehensive immigration reform . DACA was transformational , but not sufficiently so . I met a DACA kid [ see sidebar ] yesterday down in Carolina when I was there , and she inspires me . She absolutely inspires me . But she ca n't get in-state tuition , and , you know , there 's a ceiling for her , even though she 's better off now than before . So I look at executive action and legislative action as two tools in our toolbox of expanding opportunity . How can progressives organize people who don \u2019 t have the time for political activism ? Dara Lind : What are the lessons you learned while working and serving on the CASA board that you took with you when you went back to working for the government ? Tom Perez : It was something that I understood intuitively as a student in the civil rights movement , but then when you live it , you see firsthand : that change happens from the bottom up . You build things from the bottom up , you organize , and that 's how you effect change . And so I 'm trying to bring that operating principle to our paid-leave discussion ; to our skills movement ; to the working families , businesses , nonprofits , faith leaders , and educators working side by side . I just talked to 400 community college presidents and trustees this morning . And we have tremendous opportunities . The wind is at our back economically . But we 've got to make sure we have shared prosperity , and the long-term key to that is we need to upskill America . We need to equip Americans , workers , with the skills to compete . And the community I hear the most about this issue from is the business community . And I said to them , `` We need to build a movement around this . I dream of a day when I hear \u2014 and , more importantly , Congress hears \u2014 as often from the business community about skills as they do about trade or other issues . '' If you were to commission a poll of 500 employers right now , skills would be in the top three of their priorities . But we have n't built a movement around it . We 're building a movement right now around paid leave and childcare . We live in a Modern Family world , but we have these Leave It to Beaver principles that are still all too frequently in place . I mean , Rebecca , the woman who sat in the box with the first lady at the State of the Union \u2014 to put a finer point on their situation , they have two kids under the age of five , their mortgage is $ 1,400 a month , and their child-care bill is $ 1,900 a month . You ca n't survive like that for any long period of time . Dara Lind : The question that raises is : what happens when you have someone who 's working to support a family and does n't benefit from paid leave , or needs to work two jobs because he or she is n't being paid minimum wage \u2014 who might not have the energy to be the forces on the ground ? How does it affect the ability to build a movement when the people who are most likely to benefit may not be able , or just may not be terribly motivated , to make change happen , because they \u2019 re focused on their daily lives ? Tom Perez : That \u2019 s a huge question . When you look at where we were 100 years ago and you look at where we are now , there was a lot more attachment to institutions \u2014 your union , the Elks , the Eagles , bowling , your church or other place of worship . Today , there is more bowling alone . In that context , how do we build movements ? I 'm inspired by people like Sarita Gupta [ executive director of the workers-rights advocacy group Jobs With Justice ] , and others , who have recognized that we can organize low-wage workers and we can partner with businesses . She 's doing the same thing you and I are talking about . And she 's working on behalf of exactly the cohort you described : people who understand at a basic level that their life is a struggle , that the playing field is n't level , but they do n't have time to go to the rally or go to the union hall , and they may not necessarily have the wherewithal . They need help . That 's the voice we have to give . That 's why our work is so important . Because there are folks out there with a lot money to spend who are saying , `` I wake up every day figuring out how I can screw unions . '' We \u2019 ve got to understand this : that there are folks who wake up every day who believe we get ahead in America by squelching workers \u2019 voices , by making it harder for workers to organize and creating more top-down stuff . And I just refuse . The Gilded Age was not a golden age in America . That \u2019 s why we do what we 're doing here : to service that voice . That 's what gets the president out of bed every morning . These are hard battles , because the people we 're fighting on behalf of are working two and three jobs . It 's not realistic , oftentimes , to ask them to come down to Capitol Hill to do Hill visits .",
