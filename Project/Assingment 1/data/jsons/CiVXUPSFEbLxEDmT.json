U.S. government employees , including President Trump , use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools .\n\u201c This is CIA \u2019 s Edward Snowden , \u201d former CIA acting director Michael Morrell told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Justice correspondent Jeff Pegues , referring to the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked millions of documents in 2013 .\n\u201c This is huge , in terms of what it will tell the adversaries , \u201d Morrell said . \u201c We \u2019 ll have to essentially start over in building tools to get information from our adversaries , just like we did with Snowden . \u201d\nThe documents describe CIA efforts -- cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the NSA -- to subvert the world \u2019 s most popular technology platforms .\nSome of the products affected include Apple \u2019 s iPhones and iPads , Google \u2019 s Android phones and Microsoft Windows operating system ( desktop and laptops ) .\n\u201d Part 1 includes 8,761 documents from CIA \u2019 s Center for Cyber Intelligence\nClaims that CIA used products like iPhones and smart TVs as covert microphones\nClaims that the CIA used its Langley HQ and U.S. consulate in Frankfurt , Germany as bases for its hackers\nBroad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA , NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies\nCNET reports that if the CIA could break into a phone \u2019 s operating system , the agency could potentially access not just encrypted data stored on devices , but also encrypted messages sent through popular services like WhatsApp , Signal and Telegram .

Open Whisper Systems , parent company of Signal , didn \u2019 t immediately respond to requests for comment .
