    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump \u2019 s unwillingness to give up his far-flung real estate empire by selling it off or giving it outright to his children may be driven by a factor he has yet to mention publicly : a potentially staggering tax bill triggered by such a transaction .\n\u201c It could be billions , \u201d said David Herzig , a tax law professor at Valparaiso University . \u201c People are saying , \u2018 Oh well , don \u2019 t worry , \u2019 but you could be looking at the potential of billions of dollars in tax liability . \u201d\nTrump \u2014 who , with his army of lawyers , is examining his options ahead of a mid-December promised rollout of a plan to clarify the blurred lines between his business and political interests \u2014 could put off paying part of those taxes by taking advantage of a law permitting a tax-free trade to comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules , but there are legal questions about whether Trump is eligible for it .\nTo take advantage of the provision , he might have to sign an executive order qualifying himself \u2014 an action that would surely generate a barrage of criticism that he was giving himself a big tax break .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think anyone had really thought through how you go from running an active real estate business to being president , without having any income , estate and gift tax problems , \u201d Herzig said . \u201c They say , \u2018 We \u2019 ll work it out , \u2019 but saying you \u2019 ll work it out and figuring out how you \u2019 ll work it out are two different things . \u2026 This is a huge problem to try to solve in just two or three weeks . \u201d\nThe temporary waiver of capital gains taxes to comply with ethics rules was put into law in 1989 with the goal of limiting the tax impact on incoming government officials who sell assets in order to assume federal posts .\nSeveral prominent ethics experts pushing Trump to actually divest himself of his company say he should qualify for the tax certificate , typically issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics , but they acknowledge some legal uncertainty .\n\u201c No president ever asked for one . We don \u2019 t know whether a president can get one , \u201d said C. Boyden Gray , White House counsel under President George H.W . Bush . \u201c It \u2019 s never happened before because no one has ever asked for it before . \u201d\nOne potential problem is that the law authorizing such tax-free sales says the certificates should be issued only when \u201c reasonably necessary to comply with any Federal conflict of interest statute , regulation , rule , judicial canon , or executive order \u2026 or requested by a congressional committee as a condition of confirmation . \u201d\nSince the main federal conflict-of-interest law doesn \u2019 t apply to the president , it \u2019 s unclear how the ethics office would justify issuing a certificate to Trump .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a possible legal objection because the same law which exempts him and VP from criminal penalties is also the same law used to describe who qualifies , \u201d Gray said . \u201c I do believe the president would qualify if he were to divest , would qualify for tax treatment allowing him to postpone the tax . \u201d\nTrump could put himself within the sweep of the statute by issuing an executive order requiring him to divest , but critics could frame that as an unsavory form of slashing his own tax bill .\nEven if Trump could get a certificate allowing him to sell his company without immediately paying capital gains tax , there are other wrinkles that could cause problems .\nSuch certificates don \u2019 t cover gift taxes , so giving the company or any other assets to his children or selling to them at less than market value would still leave him with a hefty gift tax bill \u2014 up to 40 percent of the value over about $ 11 million . ( Trump has proposed eliminating this tax altogether , but the prospects for such legislation are uncertain . )\nGray has proposed that Trump sell the company to his children , perhaps with outside financing or a buyout , assuming they don \u2019 t have enough money on hand to buy the firm . But if outsiders give such loans , they \u2019 ll be scrutinized for signs of favor-seeking . And if Trump were to finance the sale himself , his former business would presumably be the collateral , an arrangement that would seem to produce the same conflicts of interest that it would be trying to solve .\nFormer Obama White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen says he \u2019 d support issuing the tax waiver to Trump in order to solve the conflicts but would like to see more of a traditional blind trust , with a trustee authorized to conduct an orderly sale of Trump \u2019 s business interests \u2014 perhaps through a public stock offering .\nThe Trump children could stay involved with the company if they are \u201c firewalled \u201d from government business , but trying to sell the company to the Trump kids would risk a \u201c tax calamity , \u201d Eisen said . \u201c Even if you got the certificate , there \u2019 s a question of whether the IRS would honor it with a novel arrangement . \u2026 When you \u2019 re looking at a $ 500 million potential tax bill , maybe that \u2019 s not the place you want to be . \u201d\nExperts say the precise tax impact of a sale on Trump is impossible to know without a more detailed picture of his holdings and his current tax bills . Federal financial disclosure forms indicate he has a net worth of over $ 1.4 billion . He has claimed to be worth $ 10 billion , while Forbes has estimated his net worth at $ 4 billion .\nUnlike all major presidential candidates in recent decades , Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign.The law does not require such disclosure .\nOne example of the hard-to-assess effects is that the special dispensation for resolving conflicts of interest also doesn \u2019 t apply to ordinary income , something that could further complicate the sale because selling certain kinds of assets that have been largely written off in past years can produce big income tax bills not covered by the law addressing conflicts of interest .\nTrump \u2019 s plans to retreat from his businesses have engendered both criticism and confusion in recent days , but it appears he \u2019 s not actively considering the sale of his core businesses , even to his children .\nIn an interview late last month , Trump was asked why he didn \u2019 t simply sell his company .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a very hard thing to do , you know what , because I have real estate . I have real estate all over the world , \u201d Trump told The New York Times . \u201c Selling real estate isn \u2019 t like selling stock . Selling real estate is much different .
