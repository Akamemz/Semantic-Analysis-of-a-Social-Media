As its post-mortem report said , it didn \u2019 t have to be this way .\nThe question now is , what will the candidates beaten by Mr. Trump , like Mr. Rubio , do ?

While Hillary Clinton continues her march toward the nomination , the weakness of her appeal among the young , independents , men and some working-class voters can not be ignored .

And Mr. Sanders has the drive , the money and the delegates to stay in the race until the end . No matter what happens , he will help determine the party \u2019 s future priorities .\nMr. Sanders \u2019 s quixotic candidacy has not offered concrete ways to achieve his goals with a Republican-controlled Congress , and he hasn \u2019 t been able to win over enough African-American and Latino voters . But he has managed to take aim at Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s vulnerabilities \u2014 like her paid speeches to Wall Street firms and her shifts in position on issues like gay marriage , trade agreements and immigration \u2014 to some effect . Some voters accuse her of saying whatever it takes to win , and as she tacks to the left in response to Mr. Sanders \u2019 s challenge , that perception may increase .\nStill , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s strong performance Tuesday puts her even further out of Mr. Sanders \u2019 s reach . But she has to do more than defeat him for the nomination . Mr. Sanders \u2019 s success has been as the voice of Democrats resentful of a party establishment that has been too tepid in taking on issues like income inequality .
