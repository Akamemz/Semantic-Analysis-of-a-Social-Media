    "content": "A few days ago , Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was accused of initiating sexual encounters with four girls between the ages of 14 and 18 decades ago , including one encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32 .\nHe tweeted that this was a political attack by the `` Obama-Clinton Machine 's liberal media lapdogs . '' In other words , he \u2019 s claiming there is an overarching story that explains the real truth , and it has to do with Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and the liberal media working together to concoct evidence that he \u2019 s a pedophile .\nThe day after Moore tweeted his defense , Fox News host Sean Hannity \u2014 the biggest star at the most influential news network in America \u2014 legitimized this claim .\nHannity hosted Moore on his radio show and allowed him to paint the allegations as a political attack . Hannity later went on his Fox News show and spent 15 minutes lecturing his viewers about why they should give Moore the benefit of the doubt , and he somehow included Bill Clinton and 25-year-old Freddie Gray , who died in Baltimore police custody , in his argument .\nHannity \u2019 s defense of Moore was egregious enough that some advertisers dropped their sponsorship of his show .\nI analyzed the past two years of transcripts from Hannity , his Fox News program that airs every weeknight , and found a show that peddles conspiracy theories more than any other news show in the US . Hannity often mirrors the language of online conspiracy forums , and it 's only gotten more frequent since Hannity 's friend and fellow conspiracy theorist Donald Trump became president .\nI measured this by analyzing the overlap between Hannity \u2019 s show and the top posts from Reddit 's /r/conspiracy forum . ( More on the methodology at the bottom of this post . )\nThis data is even more astounding if you consider that Hannity is a one-hour show airing only on weekdays , while many of the other top shows , like MSNBC Live and CNN 's New Day , air for multiple hours each day .\nNow , just because a show appears on this list does n't mean it peddled conspiracy theories . For example , if the president tweets out a conspiracy theory and the program covers it , then the show would make an appearance on this list . That said , there 's only so much you can talk about a conspiracy theory before you cross the line into legitimizing it .\nThat 's what Hannity does . He takes conspiracy theories and gives them a platform ; he encourages his viewers to distrust their ears , because the media and liberals are collaborating to mislead Americans .\nBut here 's the kicker : There 's evidence from Hannity 's past that shows he does n't even care if these theories are true ; all he cares about is whether they feel true to his viewers , because that \u2019 s all that matters at the ballot box .\nSo when Hannity told his viewers that Moore may not have assaulted a 14-year-old girl \u2014 that it 's possible the mainstream media and liberal strategists made this up to take down a political opponent \u2014 many believed him . He made it feel true that this was made-up .\nA few days later , pollsters asked people in Alabama whether the news about Moore made them more or less likely to support him .\nAbout 33 percent said it made no difference . About 29 percent said they were more likely to vote for him ( which as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein explained likely signals they don \u2019 t believe the allegations ) .\nPresident Trump and Sean Hannity share a similar mindset that it 's okay to say things they do n't really mean \u2014 to joke , to lie , to be hypocritical \u2014 because underneath the words , between the lines , is a greater message . In fact , it was Hannity who helped Trump push his conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was n't born in the US .\nAnd with Trump in the White House , Hannity has continued to help Trump push his conspiracy theories . In fact , it 's gotten far worse since right before the election :\nInstead of these stories being about Obama , however , they are now about Hillary Clinton .\nWhen we look at the overlap between /r/conspiracy and Hannity 's show , the large majority of the content is about Clinton 's emails , her connections with Russia , and everything in between .\nAnd Trump has followed suit on occasion , retweeting Hannity when he teases his program with stories like this one :\n# Hannity Starts in 30 minutes with @ newtgingrich and my monologue on the Deep State \u2019 s allies in the media \u2014 Sean Hannity ( @ seanhannity ) June 17 , 2017\nAll of this `` Russia '' talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform .
