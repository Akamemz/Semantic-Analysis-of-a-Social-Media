He is starting to build the wall , ban refugees , and bar Muslim immigrants . He has cut billions of dollars in funding from U.N. agencies and green-lighted the Keystone XL pipeline . He has placed a freeze on government hiring and prohibited international NGOs that receive U.S. funding from doing so much as uttering the word abortion .\nMore damage is in the works . With encouragement from the White House , Congress is already preparing to gut Obamacare and slash taxes on the rich . Judges in Texas are hearing a challenge to marriage equality and governors from Missouri to New Hampshire may soon ratchet up restrictions on labor unions .\nTrump has not yet ignored a court ruling or fired critical bureaucrats . He has not shuttered a newspaper or locked up a political opponent .

And while Trump hasn \u2019 t yet broken the law , he has continued to display disdain for basic democratic norms . There are real reasons to worry about whether we \u2019 ll get a fair chance to vote him out of office in 2020 . Three of these strike me as especially concerning :\nIt only took a few days to make clear just how committed the administration is to creating an alternative reality . All politicians try to make things appear a little more favorable to them than they really are . Many fudge or exaggerate or downplay facts to achieve this effect . But in the United States , there has traditionally been a strong political norm against blatant lying . Presidents have rarely told outright falsehoods or repeated them over and over even after they \u2019 ve been debunked .\nThe lies told by Donald Trump , Sean Spicer , and Kellyanne Conway mark the end of that tradition . Though he has never proffered evidence for the massive \u201c VOTER FRAUD \u201d he alleges , Trump is already promising to \u201c strengthen up voting procedures \u201d ( itself a very worrying sign of things to come ) . Sean Spicer has already sacrificed his credibility by running interference for his boss \u2019 boasts and falsehoods , waging an embarrassing war of words about how many people turned up for the inauguration . And in the process of defending all these shenanigans , Kellyanne Conway has coined a strikingly apt term for the administration \u2019 s efforts : It was , she said , merely providing \u201c alternative facts . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worrying enough that Trump , Spicer , and Conway are conspiring to put those alternative facts at the center of American life for the next four years . What I find even more worrying is that they have also begun to make it difficult for the press to establish real ones . Since taking office , the administration has deleted important climate-related data from government servers ; forbidden government agencies from speaking to reporters ; refused to call on representatives of critical media organizations at press conferences ; introduced a \u201c Skype-seat \u201d scheme that will make it easier for Trump to call exclusively on media outlets that are favorable to him ; promised to cut funding for PBS ; and had the president \u2019 s hired hype-men cheer for him during a speech at the CIA .\nAll in all , it is clear that the attempt to spread propaganda from the White House is already in full swing .\nOne of my biggest worries about Trump \u2019 s presidency has always been that he might repurpose existing laws to stifle dissent .

Some of the protests against the inauguration turned violent , in part because they were infiltrated by anarchists using black bloc tactics . It \u2019 s perfectly appropriate that people who committed violent acts should be punished . But it is concerning that prosecutors have taken the highly unusual step of charging them with \u201c felony rioting , \u201d which could land them in prison for 10 years . It is even more concerning that most of the 230 people who were arrested were targeted not on the basis of their actions but merely on the basis of their presence at a protest that turned violent . Most concerning of all , at least six journalists covering the protests are facing the same disproportionate charges for the same flimsy reasons\u2014something that is likely to \u201c send a chilling message to journalists covering future protests . \u201d\nFascism : A \u2588\u2588\u2588 Academy Our new series asks what happened in the 20th century\u2014and whether it \u2019 s happening again .\nIt is all the more striking that these charges were filed not by the federal government but rather by local authorities .

Like all populist leaders , he believes that the solution to these problems would be very easy if only he could carry out the people \u2019 s will without being constrained by rival power centers . And like all populist leaders , this tempts him to encroach on their authority whenever possible .\nSo what , according to that logic , is the only solution to the carnage he sees all around him ?
