If you really want to get a handle on how tomorrow \u2019 s elections will turn out , you need to go through all the competitive districts , one by one .\nIf you do that , you find the balance of power in the House of Representatives is really close \u2014 probably within a handful of seats .\nLet \u2019 s begin with Ballotpedia \u2019 s big list of competitive districts . Better to begin by looking at too many districts than too few \u2014 and they selected 80 seats .\nThat \u2019 s 71 Republican-held seats and 9 Democratic ones . Why do the Republicans have so few districts where they could win a Democrat-held seat ? Because with a few exceptions , they already picked all the low-hanging fruit in 2010 and 2014 , and held on to it through 2016 . There just aren \u2019 t that many competitive districts represented by Democrats left .\nNow let \u2019 s cross off seats that look like wishful thinking . No , Devin Nunes is not losing in California \u2019 s deeply conservative 22nd district , no matter how much Democrats wish they could make it happen . No , Mario D\u00edaz-Balart isn \u2019 t losing in Florida \u2019 s 25th district after he won nearly two-to-one last time . Cathy McMorris-Rodgers is not losing her seat in Washington \u2019 s fifth district . In Wisconsin \u2019 s first district , the home district of retiring House speaker Paul Ryan , the only polls showing Democrat Randy Bryce ahead are by Democratic firms ; the lone independent survey showed Republican Bryan Stiel ahead by six points .\nYes , one poll had Alaska \u2019 s Don Young down by one percentage point , and he \u2019 s been around 50 percent in recent cycles , but he \u2019 s the longest-serving House member , so he and his campaign probably know what it takes to win in a tough cycle . Despite the scandals and accusations , polling shows Duncan Hunter Jr. and Chris Collins hanging on pretty comfortably , and Dana Rohrabacher is in stronger shape than many expected .\nAs for the remaining races , I \u2019 ll be placing a fair amount of weight on polls when available . There \u2019 s been a lot more polling done of House races this cycle than was previously the norm , and while the polls can collectively be wrong in favor of one party \u2014 see Friday \u2019 s Morning Jolt for more discussion about that \u2014 they \u2019 re still the best measuring stick we have . ( If fundraising numbers equaled votes , Beto O \u2019 Rourke would have his race wrapped up by now . ) The partisan lean of the district in recent cycles , at both the congressional and presidential levels , counts for a lot as well . Has the incumbent demonstrated an ability to win while the other party was winning his district in the presidential race ? Did the advantages of incumbency keep a congressman winning as the district \u2019 s demographics changed , cycle by cycle ?\nThink of what follows as a \u201c reasonably pessimistic \u201d analysis . For example , Republican Barbara Comstock could win in Virginia \u2019 s tenth district , and she \u2019 s shown strength in past cycles \u2014 winning 53 percent to 47 percent , for example , while Hillary Clinton was carrying her district 52 percent to 42 percent in 2016 . But this is the classic suburban-moms-repelled-by-Trump district , and Democrat Ralph Northam won this district by 13 points in last year \u2019 s governor \u2019 s race . This district has been polled nine times since August , and Democrat Jennifer Wexton won seven times , often outside the margin of error . Pencil in a Wexton win .\nI also count on the Democratic base to be motivated and give the Democrat the edge in most races where it is close . Eleven-term incumbent Pete Sessions could well hang on in Texas \u2019 s 32nd district , but the most recent ( and probably last ) survey in this district had Democrat Colin Allred narrowly ahead . Mimi Walters is fighting to the end in California \u2019 s 45th district , but she \u2019 s narrowly trailing in all of the independent polls . For a while it looked like Democrats had blown their chances in the leaning-blue Florida 27th district , but Donna Shalala appears to have gained ground as October wore on . In Maine \u2019 s second district , incumbent Republican Bruce Poliquin is keeping it really close , but challenger Jared Golden has enjoyed a very small lead in the last two polls .\nThere are a handful of districts where we can give the Republican an edge . Young Kim has kept it really close in the independent polls in California \u2019 s 39th district ; if there were going to be a Democratic wave here , Gil Cisneros probably would have enjoyed some sizable leads in this classic swing district . In Florida , incumbent Carlos Curbela will probably hang on in Florida \u2019 s 26th district . For all the talk of Kentucky \u2019 s sixth district being the perfect bellwether race of this cycle , Republican incumbent Andy Barr hasn \u2019 t trailed in a single independent survey this autumn .\nMark down only one Republican as extremely likely to pick up a Democratic seat , though : Pete Stauber in Minnesota \u2019 s eighth district , which is currently held by retiring Democrat Rick Nolan . But there \u2019 s an outside chance of the GOP flipping a few more as well . In Arizona \u2019 s first district , Democrats are a little worried about incumbent Tom O \u2019 Halleran . So far , just over 40 percent of the returned ballots in this district are from registered Republicans , versus just over 36 percent from registered Democrats . Demographically , Minnesota \u2019 s first district is a classic opportunity for a GOP pickup ; Republican Jim Hagedorn is a controversy-prone candidate , but maybe that won \u2019 t hold him back in a nationalized election . Danny Tarkanian \u2019 s keeping it close in Nevada \u2019 s third district . As you \u2019 ll see below , any GOP upset could have big ramifications .\nPennsylvania is the state that \u2019 s going to really complicate things for Republicans , because the state supreme court redrew the district lines a few months ago , giving Democrats their dream map . Of course , it \u2019 s hard to predict what will happen in newly drawn districts . For example , Keith Rothfus won his old district with 61 percent of the vote , but now he \u2019 s up against another incumbent , Democrat Conor Lamb , in a far more Democratic area .\nOutside of Pennsylvania , it looks like Democrats will pick up 22 seats , just short of the 23 they need . But Stauber \u2019 s win in Minnesota flips one seat back to the GOP , giving Democrats a net gain of 21 . If Pennsylvania kept the status quo , the Republicans would enjoy a 220\u2013215 majority .\nWith Pennsylvania \u2019 s new lines , the consensus is that the state \u2019 s congressional balance will shift from 13\u20135 Republican ( at the beginning of this Congress ) to 9\u20139 . This gives Democrats four additional seats , adding up to a net change of 25 seats \u2014 just past the 23 seats they need for a majority .\nUnder this scenario , the good news for Democrats is that they win the House , gain the chairmanships of the House committees , and can investigate the Trump administration to their hearts \u2019 content . The bad news is that getting much of anything passed with just 220 Democrats will be extremely difficult . Republicans would no doubt attempt to entice conservative Democrats to switch parties , and vice versa . President Trump would probably go through the entire Democratic House caucus to see if any of member wanted any appointed position ; this would take a vote away from Nancy Pelosi and give the Republicans a shot at winning the seat in a special election .\nThe above analysis will probably get something wrong , and if the Republicans exceed it by just a little bit , there could be a one-seat majority . ( The Republicans will have it if they exceed this projection by three , the Democrats if Republicans exceed it by two . ) The post-election wrangling could end up even more dramatic than the campaign .\nSeats where Democrats beat a Republican , in a previously Republican-held seat : AZ-2 , CA-10 , CA-45 , CA-49 , CO-6 , FL-27 , IL-14 , IA-1 , IA-3 , KS-2 , KS-3 , ME-2 , MI-11 , MN-2 , MN-3 , NJ-2 , NJ-7 , NJ-11 , NY-19 , four seats in Pennsylvania , TX-32 , UT-4 , VA-10 .\nSeats where a Republican beats a Democrat in a previously Democrat-held seat : MN-8 .",
