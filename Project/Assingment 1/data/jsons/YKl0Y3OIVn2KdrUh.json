Because with this deal in place , it will be much harder for them to make their case that Iran should tear up its agreements and build a nuclear bomb .

They are telling a lie. \u201d Indeed , in the view of some in Tehran , such unrelenting threats and sanctions are central reasons why Iran needs a nuclear bomb .\nBut this deal undermines the Iranian hardliners \u2019 arguments and constrains their options . The deal would roll back one of their important victories \u2013 the buildup of a substantial stock of 20 percent enriched uranium that could cut the time needed for a race to the bomb \u2013 and stop Iran from edging closer to a bomb capability while the deal lasts . More important , politically , the advocates of compromise in Tehran have shown they can deliver , producing an agreement that includes real benefits .\nThe sanctions relief in the deal is only a modest mitigation of the pain , leaving the banking and oil sanctions in place for now \u2013 but the benefits it offers are real , and it explicitly holds out the promise of lifting all nuclear-related sanctions if a larger comprehensive deal can be reached .
