Jeff Denham ( R-CA ) has been leading a move to get a majority of House members to sign on to a discharge petition that would put forward floor votes on immigration , despite Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s opposition . As of Thursday , Denham said he had enough support for the discharge petition to force a vote , but he continues to negotiate behind closed doors to find a compromise immigration bill leadership can bring up . Needless to say , the Republican leadership isn \u2019 t pleased .\n\u201c Obviously , we don \u2019 t like discharge petitions , \u201d Ryan said Thursday , adding that it \u201c loses control \u201d on the House floor . But what Ryan means is he loses control over when and how to vote on immigration \u2014 if at all . Politico reported that Ryan and his team are \u201c quietly promising the figures behind the discharge petition and those who might sign that they will put a bunch of immigration bills on the floor \u201d in June \u2014 a clear effort to regain power over the situation .\nIt \u2019 s unclear where this petition will go . But what is clear from this effort is that rank-and-file members are increasingly becoming frustrated with deferring to leadership .\n\u201c When [ members ] look behind the curtain and the emperor has no clothes , then it becomes contagious , \u201d said James Wallner , a political scientist and former executive director of the Senate Steering Committee . \u201c And that \u2019 s what leaders don \u2019 t like . So far they have been successful in convincing members that it \u2019 s not good for the majority . \u201d\nSomehow , in the middle of primary election season , and against all efforts by House leadership to avoid immigration , the House seems poised for another fight on DACA .\nHouse Republican leaders have made it clear : They don \u2019 t want their members to sign on to the discharge petition to force a floor vote on various immigration bills . They say the process will devolve into chaos , that it will guarantee nothing that can actually pass will become law . They also fear it will reveal deep discord in the party \u2014 in a contentious election year , no less .\n\u201c What the leadership would like to happen is for members not to act , same in the Senate , because then you can \u2019 t control what happens next , \u201d Wallner said .\nYet support for the petition was growing by the hour Thursday . Denham , a California Republican who is vulnerable in a Hispanic-heavy district this fall , has been driving the process . He is eager to pass some kind of DACA fix .\nInterestingly , he isn \u2019 t alone in pushing past leadership \u2019 s timeline this week .\nOn Wednesday , a bipartisan group of senators defied Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission \u2019 s controversial ruling to dismantle net neutrality .\nThe vote to reinstate the Obama-era net neutrality rules won the support of 49 Democrats as well as three Republican senators : Susan Collins of Maine , John Kennedy of Louisiana , and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska . That group was enough to pass the 51-vote benchmark needed to repeal recently introduced federal rules , such as the FCC \u2019 s internet guidance .\nTo be sure , this fight will have a difficult road ahead . It has to be voted on \u2014 and to pass \u2014 in the House and be signed by the president ( or gain a veto-proof majority ) . President Trump probably wouldn \u2019 t sign such a bill .\nThen on Thursday , Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand invoked an obscure Senate rule to try to put a House-passed sexual harassment and discrimination bill on the Senate calendar without McConnell \u2019 s support , in another sign of frustration .\nThe bill would overhaul how harassment complaints are made in Congress and make lawmakers personally accountable for paying settlements . The legislation , a version of which the House has passed 100 days ago , has been stalled in the Senate while negotiators iron out some details in the language . But many \u2014 like Gillibrand \u2014 have grown impatient .\nThere are a lot of ways regular members can take control . They just typically don \u2019 t .\nIt \u2019 s not necessarily easy for rank-and-file lawmakers to force leadership \u2019 s hand . But there are ways to do it . In the past week , we have seen three different methods put into action .\nDemocrats , with the support of several Republicans , used the Congressional Review Act , which allows Congress to repeal recent federal rules and regulations within a specific time window from when they were enacted \u2014 it only needs a simple majority of support to pass .\nIn the Senate , Gillibrand invoked the obscure Rule 14 , which allows members to expedite legislation by bypassing committee deliberations and putting it straight on the Senate calendar . To be clear , \u201c placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full Senate will ever consider it , \u201d according to the Congressional Research Service . Because of the current schedule around judicial nominations , Gillibrand would likely be blocked from calling a vote . Even so , if she had enough support , she could find a way to bypass a lot of those obstacles .\nIn the House , Democrats and Republicans are using a discharge petition , which can force a vote to be brought to the floor as long as it has 218 signatories . If enough House members are opposed to the process of something , they can also vote to block the rules on a bill , which determine the terms of a full floor vote \u2014 how much debate time a bill will have , which amendments will be voted on , and so forth .\nAll of these methods are at lawmakers \u2019 disposal to buck leadership . Yet often \u2014 as we have seen in the leadership-driven health care , tax reform , and immigration fights this year \u2014 they don \u2019 t happen . Why ?
