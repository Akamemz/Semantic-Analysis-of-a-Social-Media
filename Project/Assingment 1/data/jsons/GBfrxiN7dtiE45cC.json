Michael Avenatti , the lawyer who gained national prominence for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels , who says she was paid to stay silent about an alleged affair with President Trump , says he has credible evidence of a third incident of sexual assault implicating Kavanaugh .\nBut in the US Senate , there \u2019 s still no indication that Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation proceedings will be slowing down much .\nChristine Blasey Ford , a professor at Palo Alto University in California who came forward with a sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh last week , is expected to testify in the Senate Judiciary Committee this Thursday . Deborah Ramirez , who has made allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh , is not yet part of that hearing .\nBoth Ramirez and Ford have called for an FBI investigation into their allegations , but Republicans have denied that request , saying the FBI can not judge on the credibility of allegations . Senate Democrats argue , however , that the investigators would serve as a more nonpartisan fact-finding body .\nFord told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh held her down at a high school party in the 1980s and attempted to force himself on her , covering her mouth to quiet her protests . Her allegations were documented by her therapist in notes from sessions in 2012 and 2013 , in which Ford talked about a \u201c rape attempt \u201d and being attacked by students \u201c from an elitist boys \u2019 school. \u201d Ramirez told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a group drinking game at a freshman-year college party at Yale , thrusting his penis in her face .\nKavanaugh has denied the allegations . The White House , so far , has stood by him .\nSenate Republicans have been pushing to get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court this fall , before the midterm elections , spinning the allegations as a last-ditch Democratic attempt to hold up the confirmation .\nBut as more details emerge and more accusers come forward , there are still a lot of moving parts and unanswered questions . Here \u2019 s what we know so far about where things stand , what the White House is saying , and what kind of investigation might be conducted .\nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee said they will hold a public hearing on Thursday , September 27 , at 10 am for both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify .\nRepublicans have agreed that Ford would not be in the same room as Kavanaugh , and there would only be one camera in the room .\nDespite Ford \u2019 s lawyers \u2019 objections , however , Republicans reportedly said they would bring in an outside lawyer to question Ford . According to the Daily Beast , Republicans are eying former New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte to serve as outside counsel .\nA statement from her lawyer says Ford does not think a hearing with just two witnesses qualifies as a \u201c fair or good faith investigation , \u201d though she said she is willing to cooperate with the committee .\nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee have not been involved in organizing the hearings , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) , the top Democrat on the committee , has called for the committee to delay Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation proceedings indefinitely , until a thorough investigation has been completed .\nHowever , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) another high-ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , said the Senate should simply hear from Ford and move to a committee vote .\nA committee vote on Kavanaugh \u2019 s hearing has not been rescheduled \u2014 yet . This would be the first vote in the process of confirming Kavanaugh to the Court and serves as a recommendation to the Senate as a whole . The full Senate can still vote , and confirm , Kavanaugh even without the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s approval .\nRepublicans are adamant that any investigation into allegations of sexual assault will be done in the Senate .\nWith Ford , Republican staff on the committee held calls with Kavanaugh and tried to get in touch with Ford last week , which Democrats did not participate in . From the start , Democrats said that Republicans aren \u2019 t capable of handling this review in an impartial manner and think the FBI needs to conduct an investigation . However , Republicans proceeded with the matter regardless .\nFeinstein has referred the case to the FBI , which is in charge of background checks for nominees . The FBI said it has added the letter to Kavanaugh \u2019 s background file , which means that the White House and the full body of senators now have access to it .
