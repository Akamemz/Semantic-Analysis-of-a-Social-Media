Slap and tickle\n\nSources say the president will point out bipartisan progress on immigration reform but he'll take it to the GOP on debt and tax reform. Already, Republicans are bracing to play victim.\n\nTally up the jabs and weigh them against mentions of common ground. That will be an early scorecard for Wednesday-morning quarterbacking.\n\n2. Wish lists\n\nExpect to forget what the president says. Nothing personal, Mr. President, but State of the Union addresses are notoriously forgotten.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was a great orator -- quick, what did he say in his State of the Unions? How about Reagan?

What he doesn't say\n\nAn average of 44 million people have watched Obama deliver previous State of the Union addresses. His aides say a huge audience equals a huge opportunity.\n\nSo, will he seize the opportunity to answer his critics and respond to his base on issues including: U.S. use of unmanned drones, the legal rationale for targeting Americans, U.S. policy in Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and security of U.S. diplomatic posts? On the domestic front, will he address poverty in the United States?\n\nWill any of these controversial issues make the cut?\n\n4. Keep count\n\nCount how many times your issue gets mentioned.\n\nWhile presidential speechwriters insist the amount of time dedicated to an issue in most speeches doesn't matter as much as the language used to describe it, the State of the Union is an exception. That's because every word is debated.\n\nAides say this speech will be heavy on economic themes.

Will she or won't she?\n\nSerious people don't care -- or so they say. But since first lady Michelle Obama shocked tout de D.C. by showing her guns in the heroes box during the president's 2009 joint address to Congress, her outfit has become one of the best (sometimes only) surprises of the night.\n\nWill she bare her arms again?
