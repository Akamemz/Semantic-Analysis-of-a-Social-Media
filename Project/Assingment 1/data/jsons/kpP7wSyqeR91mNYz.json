    "content": "After President Barack Obama \u2019 s own party slammed the brakes on the centerpiece of his trade agenda \u2014 also a top priority for the GOP \u2014 there were early signs Democrats were considering concessions to revive the fast-track bill .\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , who rallied his caucus to reject the fast-track measure on a procedural vote , has already floated a plan to find a way out of the impasse by offering to drop anti-currency manipulation language in a customs bill from his party \u2019 s list of demands .\nWhile his initial overture likely won \u2019 t settle the issue , and top Republicans said they were skeptical of Reid \u2019 s proposal , Democrats \u2019 willingness to return to the bargaining table suggests the trade measure may not be dead . And pro-trade Democrats huddled with the White House on Tuesday evening , as the administration looked for a way forward .\nAfter demanding that Republicans bundle four separate trade bills \u2014 in part to accommodate Democratic demands for more worker protections \u2014 Reid is privately saying that he \u2019 d be willing to drop the currency manipulation provisions , according to people familiar with the situation .\nLed by Reid , the liberal , anti-trade wing of the Democratic Party joined with pro-trade moderates to block fast-track legislation , 52-45 , in an effort to force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) to take up the larger trade package . Democrats had wanted the Senate to pass new worker protections , child labor restrictions and the customs bill all together , in addition to the fast-track trade bill McConnell and Obama are pushing .\nMcConnell , just five months into his role as majority leader , refused to bow to Democratic wishes , partially out of concern over ceding too much authority to the minority to dictate the chamber \u2019 s agenda . And the Republican leader suggested Democrats need to sort out their intraparty differences .\n\u201c What we just saw here is pretty shocking , \u201d McConnell said immediately following the vote . \u201c What we just witnessed here is Democratic senators shutting down debate on the top economic priority of the Democratic president of the United States . \u201d\nBut under Democrats \u2019 latest strategy , the customs bill would be pulled out of the bigger package for a standalone vote , something Sens . Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) and John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) were discussing on Tuesday , after Schumer first suggested the move .\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden , the lead Democratic negotiator on trade , had suggested a similar move last week , only to be rebuffed by Reid .\nOn Tuesday evening , senior Republicans said they were skeptical of Reid \u2019 s overture , but acknowledged talks were ongoing . And they noted there were problems with the customs bill beyond just the currency language .\nStill , the currency manipulation provision is considered a poison pill by Republicans and is not supported by the administration , so removing it from the larger package could help the Senate overcome Tuesday \u2019 s partisan deadlock . The provision could force the White House to designate China as a currency manipulator , which the administration fears would spark a trade war with Beijing .\nThe Democrats \u2019 internal dispute puts the president in an awkward position , caught between Republicans who want to work with him on the multination Trans-Pacific Partnership pact and Senate Democratic leaders who are using their procedural leverage to get as much as they can out of McConnell .\nTrade proponents in both parties vowed on Tuesday to try to put the pieces back together and the fracas doesn \u2019 t mean the fast-track is dead , especially if Reid is committed to finding a way out . The GOP and White House officials argue that enacting fast-track Trade Promotion Authority is critical for Obama \u2019 s ability to strike a landmark trade deal with Pacific Rim countries , and the roadblock in the Senate threatens progress on that pact .\nAfter the vote , Reid , an anti-trade Democrat who devised the strategy to slow the bill on Tuesday , hinted at a way out of the Senate \u2019 s latest jam .\n\u201c I suggest the way we move forward is to have a program where we have all of these bills discussed at the same time , \u201d Reid said . \u201c Everybody should just take a deep breath . I think there \u2019 s probably a way we can move forward with this . \u201d\nBut with little more than a week before the Memorial Day recess and several expiring laws still to be addressed , the immediate future of Obama \u2019 s trade agenda is uncertain .\nThough Republicans believed they had a deal to move so-called Trade Promotion Authority alongside Trade Adjustment Assistance , Democrats are seeking greater assurances that the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a customs enforcement bill , which includes the currency manipulation provisions , will all be passed as part of a deal to open debate on the trade bill .\n\u201c We hope the White House will join us in the effort to get currency stronger \u2014 and pressure McConnell to make sure these bills move concurrently , not just take two on his own whim and leave two behind , \u201d Schumer said .\nThe GOP is flabbergasted at these demands , insisting that the currency provision , in particular , is veto bait for the White House , potentially complicating the trade package \u2019 s future if it is approved .\nMoreover , McConnell and other Republicans blasted Wyden for changing an \u201c understanding \u201d that pro-trade Democrats and Republicans had to move forward on the bill .\nAnd as Senate Democrats prodded Obama to join their quest for procedural victory over recalcitrant Republicans , the GOP was urging the president to take a more critical tone not just with anti-trade Democrats like Elizabeth Warren , but also pro-trade Democrats who they believe are making a trade agreement increasingly difficult .\n\u201c Really , it \u2019 s a question of whether the president of the United States has enough clout with members of his political party , \u201d said Cornyn , the majority whip .
