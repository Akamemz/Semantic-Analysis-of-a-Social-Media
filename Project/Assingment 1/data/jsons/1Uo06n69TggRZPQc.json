    "content": "A few weeks ago , once it was confirmed that she \u2019 d been anointed as a new member of the Senate Democrats \u2019 leadership team , I wrote a column urging Sen. Elizabeth Warren to focus on building a power base from within the party , and to ignore those calling on her to run for president . Going off of the example set by the conservative activists who successfully transformed the GOP from a center-right party into one situated much closer to the fringe , I suggested that if Warren really saw herself as on a mission , then she should work on moving the Democratic Party \u2019 s policymaking infrastructure to the left \u2014 and forget about moving herself to 1600 Pennsylvania . As recent experience has shown , it doesn \u2019 t matter how liberal a president is if the rest of his party is still in big money \u2019 s pocket .\nWhen the piece first ran , it wasn \u2019 t really a prediction so much as a hope . I had no real insight into Warren \u2019 s thinking or her long-term plans . And the allure of the presidency must be overwhelming , especially when there are so many outsiders practically begging for you to run . It \u2019 s undoubtedly a much more romantic and exciting prospect than a decades-long struggle to move the unwieldy bureaucracy of the Democratic Party to the left . However , it may turn out that my column was rather unnecessary ; because , judging by her speech this week to a group of financial reformers , Warren doesn \u2019 t sound like she \u2019 s readying herself for a presidential campaign . No , she sounds more like she \u2019 s readying for an ideological war .\nOut of the many reports on Warren \u2019 s performance at the \u201c Managing the Economy \u201d conference , I thought the one \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor David Dayen penned for the New Republic did the best job of situating her address within the framework of the fight that \u2019 s happening right now among Democrats over the party \u2019 s future direction . It would be impossible to categorize the groups perfectly ( that Will Rogers quote about being a member of no organized party has endured for a reason ) . But , in broad strokes , the division is between neoliberals , who want minimal regulations on Wall Street , and populists , who believe Wall Street has become a threat to the middle class . Warren is , by far , the most recognizable member of the latter group , while the neoliberals , lacking a star of their own , have had to settle for Andrew Ross Sorkin , the wunderkind Wall Street reporter who \u2019 s repeatedly criticized Warren in the New York Times .\nRecently , these two sides have been battling over whether President Obama , who is a member of the neoliberal contingent , should withdraw his nomination of Antonio Weiss to be the next undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department ( which is the bureaucracy \u2019 s third-most-powerful slot ) . Weiss is currently an employee of the financial powerhouse Lazard , where he specializes in mergers and acquisitions , and from whom he \u2019 s set to receive a $ 20 million bonus if he takes the government job . Warren has argued that Weiss has no experience with the issues pertinent to the Treasury position in question , and that his selection is yet another spin of the revolving door . Being the fly in the White House \u2019 s ointment on this issue has predictably earned Warren some criticism from elites ; but as Dayen shows in his report , the senator seems inclined to escalate the conflict rather than back down .\n\u201c We \u2019 d all scratch our heads if the president nominated a theoretical physicist to be surgeon general just because she had a background in science , \u201d Warren said to the conference audience , responding indirectly to the barbs thrown her way by Sorkin and others . \u201c It \u2019 s no less puzzling to nominate an international mergers specialist to handle largely domestic issues at Treasury because he has a background in finance. \u201d More striking , however , was Warren \u2019 s decision to transition from defending her stance on the Weiss nomination to criticizing those who have built and maintained the revolving door \u2014 Democrats included . \u201c Time after time in government , \u201d Warren said , \u201c the Wall Street view prevails. \u201d After blaming this epistemic closure on the way Wall Street and fellow-traveling Democrats make it so Wall Street \u2019 s critics are \u201c crowded out , \u201d Warren then tied the dynamic to recent Dem-supported policies that , she believes , benefited the 1 percent at the expense of everyone else .\nThis is the kind of rhetoric you hear a lot from Democrats of all kinds during campaign season ( though , of course , the blame is always laid entirely on Republicans ) . But it \u2019 s not the kind of rhetoric you \u2019 d expect to hear from a newbie senator with presidential aspirations , especially one who \u2019 d just been brought into the party \u2019 s inner circle \u2014 and especially one who \u2019 d already received tut-tuts from the Dems \u2019 formidable neoliberal wing . ( Running for president is very , very expensive . ) What it is instead , as Dayen rightly notes , is the kind of rhetoric you \u2019 d expect from someone whose main goal is to drive Wall Street and its defenders \u201c out of the temple of policymaking , \u201d and to give the anti-neoliberal wing within the party , which has been growing in strength since the 2008 financial collapse , a direction and a voice .\nAnd the fact that many high-profile Democratic senators \u2014 including Sen. Dick Durbin , Sen. Al Franken , Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and even Sen. Joe Manchin , the West Virginia conservative \u2014 are joining her in opposing the Weiss nomination shows that it may be working . For those hoping that Warren would respond to her ascension into the Dems \u2019 Senate leadership by keeping her criticisms within the family , as it were , the speech was a bad sign .
