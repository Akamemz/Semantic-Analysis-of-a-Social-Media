Incorrect beliefs are easier to overcome than an ingrained lack of trust . However , as the researchers later demonstrate , even that remedy may prove hard to achieve .\nDylan Minor , a visiting assistant professor of business administration in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Strategy unit , and co-author Pablo Hernandez of New York University , dive into the topic in their working paper Political Identity and Trust .\n\u201c Our biggest headline finding is that it seems that it \u2019 s beliefs that drive trust , not taste ''\nIf it seems we are a nation of opposites more than ever , we are . According to a Pew Research Center report in 2014 , political polarization of the American public has increased , and partisan antagonism is `` deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades . ''\n\u201c When we look at people \u2019 s political identities , we know there is huge polarization in America , \u201d Minor says . \u201c But a fundamental question is , are these being driven by what economists would call taste\u2014 \u2018 I like red people and don \u2019 t like green people \u2019 \u2014or is it driven by beliefs\u2014 \u2018 it \u2019 s not that I don \u2019 t like them per se , I just don \u2019 t think we can trust them. \u2019 Those are two completely different reasons that observationally result in the same thing\u2014 \u2018 I don \u2019 t trust them \u2019 \u2014but has very different policy implications and takeaways for practitioners . \u201d\nMinor says the overarching issue is what leads people to trust one group over another , which has implications for business as well as the political arena .\nCounter to previous studies , his team \u2019 s results indicated that a particular group that participants belonged to was less important than how trustworthy they thought the other group was .\n\u201c Our biggest headline finding is that it really seems that it \u2019 s actually beliefs that drive trust , not taste . That \u2019 s actually good news because it \u2019 s harder to change people \u2019 s taste preferences than it is beliefs , \u201d says Minor , joking that he \u2019 s been trying to change his daughter \u2019 s food tastes for years .\nMinor used a survey pool of 7,000 pre-screened individuals across the country that were obtained by Northwestern University \u2019 s Kellogg School of Management .

Participants , identified by political party in Kellogg \u2019 s pre-screening but not yet told the survey had anything to do with politics , were asked to divide $ 5 between themselves and another anonymous participant .

Next participants were asked what they would do if they were Player B and the decision were passed to them . They then were asked to guess what percentage of the group they were paired with ( Republicans or Democrats ) would prove trustworthy . If they guessed the correct decile , they were given an additional $ 3 .\nThe results : Democrats trusted other Democrats 63 percent of the time ( by passing the decision ) and trusted Republicans 40 percent of the time . Republicans trusted other Republicans 58 percent of the time and trusted Democrats 66 percent of the time .\n\u201c What we find , at least for political identity , is that there \u2019 s this stereotype that Democrats are more trustworthy than Republicans\u2014and that belief was held by both Democrats and Republicans , \u201d Minor says .\nPredictions of how trustworthy Player B would prove to be were similar \u2013 63 percent of Republicans believed their partner would be trustworthy while Democrats predicted 62 percent would .
