    "content": "Plane and car emissions have fallen since the pandemic struck . Has Covid-19 in some way helped the environment ?\nWe \u2019 ve certainly given the earth a bit of a breather because the rate we are emitting greenhouse gases has dropped , although by less than many expected given the slowdown in industrial activity . Air pollution has dropped dramatically in a number of places , which is great and will save lives . But remember that the levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are already the highest they have ever been . We \u2019 re still in a very dangerous situation .\nExpand The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco , shown obscured in smoke in November 2018 , after the disastrous Camp Fire occurred north of Sacramento . US Interior Secretary at the time , Ryan Zinke , said wildfires in California in 2018 released roughly the same amount of carbon emissions as are produced each year to provide electricity to the state . \u00a9 2018 Eric Risberg/AP Images\nWhat do you think will happen as lockdowns are lifted ?\nIt depends how governments respond . Massive amounts of money are being given for recovery programs to get economies going , and some countries are trying do so in a more green and sustainable direction . Policymakers and scientists largely agree that to slow the impact of the climate crisis we need a rapid transition from polluting fossil fuels like coal , oil , and gas to cleaner sources of energy , such as wind and solar . So these recovery packages are an opportunity to address the climate crisis . Unfortunately the early signs are that some governments are going to continue with their \u201c business as usual \u201d model .\nGovernments are spending so much money on fighting the pandemic . Will there be enough left to fund a move to cleaner energy ?\nLook at the massive government subsidies for the fossil fuel industry . And they are asking for more . A wiser approach would be to prioritize assistance to the clean energy sector . Why not try to resolve both crises , instead of trying to fix the economy while simultaneously making the climate crisis worse ?\nIn areas of higher air pollution , people are more likely to die of complications from Covid-19 . What \u2019 s the link here ?\nAir pollution is a massive problem globally but gets little attention in part because it \u2019 s an invisible killer . The World Health Organization estimates 4 million people die prematurely from it every year . Air pollution affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems , plus air pollution typically makes people more susceptible to respiratory diseases and may lead to more severe symptoms or increased deaths from respiratory infections , including Covid-19 . Groups disproportionally impacted by air pollution \u2013 including older people , the chronically ill , and those living in poverty \u2013 are also at higher risk from the virus .\nIn many parts of the world poorer people live in more heavily industrialized areas , which tend to have the highest air pollution . In these often more densely populated areas , more people live under one roof so social distancing is almost impossible . These people often have poorer health baselines , due in part to air pollution . So it \u2019 s all linked .\nExpand A man wearing a mask is seen in front of the Forbidden City in Beijing , October 18 , 2013 . \u00a9 2013 Reuters\nMany people have lost their jobs . What would be the impact on jobs of a transition to renewable energy ?\nThe impact could be positive both for people and the environment , and it will take leadership . The European Union has talked about a green deal , with ambitious plans to transform their economies to green alternatives . Supporting people whose livelihoods relied on the fossil fuel industry is challenging and expensive , but not impossible . Our economies need to continue functioning and that requires continued energy production . All types of energy create jobs : it \u2019 s just a question of whether we want that energy to be polluting and lead us into another crisis .\nExpand Traffic making its way into Manhattan from Brooklyn over the Williamsburg Bridge , New York City , March 28 , 2019 . \u00a9 2019 AP Photo/Mary Altaffer\nThis is one of our biggest concerns : that the Covid-19 pandemic will give governments a reason or a pretext to roll back or relax environmental protections . It \u2019 s clear that lobbyists representing car , aviation , plastics , and fossil fuel industries are taking advantage of Covid-19 and pushing governments hard to give them a pass on environmental standards .\nThe Trump administration has announced a temporary ban on most routine environmental monitoring and reporting requirements if companies can show a Covid-related reason . They also rolled back car emission and air pollution standards . In Canada , in the oil-rich province of Alberta , they \u2019 ve announced a similar ban on enforcement of environmental regulations . We \u2019 ve seen European governments , such as Poland and the Czech Republic , urging the relaxation of some environmental standards , and it \u2019 s happening in Brazil too . Many of these standards help protect human health , so to cut them during a public health crisis is counterproductive .\nBut these protections are an additional cost for businesses , right ?\nThere is a cost of upholding these standards , of course , but it should be seen as a cost of doing business . Many operations like oil , gas , and mining have been deemed essential services in certain countries , so they \u2019 re continuing to make revenue but are trying to trim expenses around regulations that protect human health and the public good .
