    "content": "For the first time in nearly a month , Donald Trump looks mortal again .\nFour states held Republican primaries or caucuses on Saturday , but the GOP frontrunner came away with just two wins that were both quite narrow , in Louisiana and Kentucky . He lost the Maine caucuses \u2014 his first defeat in the Northeast \u2014 and got blown out in Kansas .\nAnd for the first time , it appeared that most of the anti-Trump voters across the country broke toward the same candidate \u2014 Ted Cruz . The Texas senator easily won Kansas and Maine , and finished just a few points behind Trump in both Louisiana and Kentucky .\nCruz 's victory in Maine was particularly impressive . Until today , the Texas senator had n't managed to top 12 percent in any of the three Northeastern states that had voted so far ( New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Vermont ) . This led many analysts to conclude that Cruz 's appeal was regionally limited \u2014 that he could n't win in the Northeast . But the Maine outcome complicates this narrative .\nPerhaps the most heartening development for Cruz , though , was in Louisiana , where results indicated that voters swung late toward him and away from Trump and Rubio .\nThe first votes to be counted were early votes , which , according to Nate Silver , showed Trump dominant with about 48 percent , and Cruz and Rubio essentially tied with 23 percent and 20 percent , respectively . That looked like it would mirror what we saw in the rest of the Deep South on Super Tuesday .\nBut as election day votes were gradually counted , Cruz 's share of the vote suddenly surged , while Trump 's declined and Rubio 's utterly collapsed . The most recent vote total showed Trump still in first with 42 percent , but Cruz not too far behind him at 38 percent , while Rubio was far back at a mere 11 percent .\nAnd if future states ' results look more like those Louisiana election day tallies , things will get really interesting .\nWe could be heading for a Trump vs. Cruz race\nAll this matters because Trump has been winning plurality victories against a divided field so far . He did n't have one clear nemesis in every state \u2014 instead , voters rallied behind Cruz in some states , Rubio in others , and even Kasich in a couple .\nSuper Tuesday looked so excellent for Trump because both it looked like the race might remain in that stasis for a while \u2014 with Trump in first , but Rubio and Cruz relatively competitive with each other for second in a variety of states .\nBut tonight , things suddenly looked quite different . Rubio utterly dropped off the map in Louisiana and Maine , getting about 11 percent and 8 percent of the vote , respectively . He did a bit better in Kansas and Kentucky , but could only get 17 percent in each .
