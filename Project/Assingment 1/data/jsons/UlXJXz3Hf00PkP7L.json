    "content": "Hundreds of protesters descended upon Charlottesville , Virginia , on Saturday for a \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally : a belated coming-out party for an emboldened white nationalist movement in the United States .\nThe rally was dispersed by police minutes after its scheduled start at noon , after clashes between rallygoers and counter-protesters , and after a torchlit pre-rally march Friday night descended into violence .\nBut later that day , as rallygoers began a march and counterprotests continued , a reported Nazi sympathizer drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters , killing one and injuring 19 .\nSelf-described \u201c pro-white \u201d activist Jason Kessler organized the rally to protest the planned removal of a statue of confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville . Kessler is affiliated with the alt-right movement that uses internet trolling tactics to argue against diversity and \u201c identity politics \u201d \u2014 part of a broader cultural backlash that helped elect Donald Trump .\nBut the rally quickly attracted other more traditional groups of white nationalists , neo-Nazis , and the Ku Klux Klan .\nThe involvement of hate groups and the threat of violence led the city of Charlottesville to attempt to marginalize the rally for \u201c hate speech , \u201d but the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) defended the demonstrators \u2019 rights . The combination of rallygoers spoiling for a fight , and counter-protestors determined to convey that the rallygoers \u2019 ideology was not welcome in America , allowed the violence to overshadow the speech \u2014 and eventually prevent the rally from going forward as planned .\nPlans to remove a Confederate statue have made Charlottesville a hot spot for right-wing activism\nCharlottesville , like many cities in the South , still has public spaces and monuments celebrating heroes of the Confederacy \u2014 many of which weren \u2019 t erected until the 20th century , as the civil rights movement began to pick up steam and Jim Crow laws started to come under attack .\nIn the wake of the 2015 massacre of several worshipers at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston by a white supremacist , there \u2019 s been a renewed push to remove some of these Confederate monuments and rename streets and squares honoring the Confederacy . But where those campaigns have succeeded , there \u2019 s often been a backlash from conservatives concerned about attempts to erase history , Southerners who consider the Confederacy part of their \u201c heritage , \u201d and outright white nationalists .\nIn Charlottesville , advocates targeted a statue of Robert E. Lee in a park called Lee Square \u2014 city council members pointed out that Lee had no connection to Charlottesville , implying that commemorating him was just an indirect way to celebrate the Confederacy , while a high-school student collected 600 signatures on a Change.org petition to rename the statue . ( A counter-petition collected 2,000 signatures . )\nIn February , the city council voted to sell the statue and rename the park Emancipation Park . ( The statue is still in place . )\nThe decision made the city a target for right-wing activism and shows of strength \u2014 and for activists keen to stand up to them and demonstrate that such ideas weren \u2019 t welcome . The Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Charlottesville in July , which was dwarfed by a massive counter-protest .\nMeanwhile , Charlottesville resident Jason Kessler \u2014 a pro-white activist and a member of the Proud Boys , a loose collective of pro-Trump alt-rightists \u2014 put together the Unite the Right rally for Saturday , to be held at what event posters still call Lee Park . Speakers include some of the alt-right personalities who have flirted most openly with white nationalism , including Baked Alaska , an internet provocateur who was once the tour manager for fellow internet provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos , as well as self-identified white nationalists like Richard Spencer .\nPolitical researcher Spencer Sunshine of the firm Political Research Associates told the Guardian \u2019 s Jason Wilson that while the rally was originally intended to attract a broad coalition of right-wing groups , it had become \u201c increasingly Nazified \u201d \u2014 with some primarily anti-government \u201c patriot \u201d groups refusing to sign on , and explicitly fascist groups like the National Socialist Movement getting on board instead .\nAnd many supporters and attendees of the rally certainly had no problem using Nazi tropes to promote it , as this \u201c fan art \u201d poster shows :\nAccording to the Charlottesville police affidavit put out before the rally , planned attendees included the Klan ; the militia movement ( a right-wing movement that gained traction in the 1990s , whose members include the activists who took over a federal nature reserve in early 2016 ) ; the \u201c 3 % \u201d , a right-wing anti-government movement ; the Alt-Knights , an alt-right \u201c fight club \u201d ; and others .\n\u2022 200-300 Militia pic.twitter.com/Xfg44vmQlT \u2014 Jack Smith IV ( @ JackSmithIV ) August 12 , 2017\nThe arc of the Unite the Right rally \u2014 from an ostensible attempt to bring a broad coalition of conservative groups together to protest the controversial removal of a statue , to a \u201c Nazified \u201d rally for \u201c the pro-white movement in America \u201d \u2014 mirrors what \u2019 s been happening to the alt-right as a whole . The movement \u2019 s leaders have become increasingly willing to dabble in white-nationalist rhetoric and tropes , while attempting to avoid direct accusations of being themselves white nationalists .\nThe rise of the alt-right is one face of a broader backlash against \u201c identity politics \u201d and \u201c political correctness , \u201d which have left some white Americans feeling that they \u2019 re losing ground to nonwhites \u2014 or that America is losing its identity \u2014 and that political , economic , and media elites are either uninterested in defending their heritage or actively trying to eradicate it .\nAmong some younger , more internet-savvy people , hatred of \u201c political correctness \u201d has paired neatly with online troll culture , in which pushing boundaries and offending people is seen as harmless at worst and a show of cleverness at best .\nIn 2015 and 2016 , the alt-right was an inescapable online presence , with some of its members crediting the movement \u2019 s \u201c meme magic \u201d with the unexpected popularity of Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary and , later , the general election . With Trump \u2019 s election , some of its leaders have become more seriously engaged in politics , via pro-Trump organizations like the Proud Boys and the Alt-Knights .\nLike Trump himself , alt-right leaders didn \u2019 t start out by explicitly aligning themselves with the sort of right-wing groups and movements that almost everyone in 2017 America is willing to agree are racist \u2014 like the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan . But racist rhetoric has become a hallmark of the movement , from the use of \u201c cuck \u201d to deride anti-alt-right conservatives to Twitter harassment of Jewish journalists by Photoshopping them into images of Nazi gas chambers .\nThat crosses the line into ideologies that most Americans agree are taboo . People may believe that Donald Trump supporters aren \u2019 t necessarily racists , but they are willing to agree that members of the Klan and Nazis are racists . Indeed , it \u2019 s a contrast with those groups that allows some people to draw the line between \u201c real racism \u201d and liberals \u201c crying wolf \u201d about racism . ( This is true outside the alt-right as well \u2014 just look at pro-Trump commentator Jeffrey Lord , fired by CNN this week after tweeting \u201c Sieg heil ! \u201d in what he claims was a joke . )\nMany public figures and politicians on the left , center , and center-right have argued that the alt-right is defined by these actions \u2014 among many on the left , the term \u201c alt-right \u201d itself is an unacceptable euphemism that legitimizes an ideology that would be considered unacceptable if it were simply called white nationalism . Progressive writer Lindy West wrote in 2016 that the term \u201c alt-right \u201d was \u201c an attempt to rebrand warmed-over Reconstruction-era white supremacy as a cool , new ( and harmless ! ) internet fad . \u201d\nInstead of responding by deliberately distancing themselves from white nationalism , though , leaders of the alt-right have deliberately blurred the distinction . They \u2019 ve adopted memes and hand gestures ( like the \u201c okay \u201d symbol ) as an inside joke , because people outside the movement have mistaken them for white nationalist symbols . The attitude tends to be that if \u201c the left \u201d is going to see them as Nazis , they might as well encourage that conception .\nBut there are plenty of people whose Naziism isn \u2019 t ironic at all . And at an event like the Unite the Right rally , it \u2019 s impossible to tell the difference between someone who \u2019 s wearing a swastika pin or giving a Nazi salute \u201c ironically \u201d and someone who \u2019 s doing it in earnest . The people who claim they \u2019 re doing it \u201c ironically \u201d don \u2019 t appear to have any problem with that confusion .\nThe line between \u201c protected speech \u201d and violent street fighting is getting very blurry\nAs the movement behind the Unite the Right rally has become so closely intertwined with groups universally condemned as racist , the response to the rally has started to treat it as inherently illegitimate \u2014 as an attack on the rights of people of color , LGBTQ Americans , non-Christians , and immigrants to live and worship safely in the United States .\nAirbnb shut down accounts of users who were seeking accommodations in Charlottesville for the rally , citing its \u201c Community Commitment \u201d : \u201c those who are members of the Airbnb community accept people regardless of their race , religion , national origin , ethnicity , disability , sex , gender identity , sexual orientation , or age . ''\nAnd local governments have taken the initiative to shut down right-wing demonstrations before they happen \u2014 forcing them into the tricky position of deciding the line between protected free speech activity and physical violence waiting to happen .\nIn Portland in June , the city government attempted to revoke a permit for a pro-Trump \u201c free speech \u201d rally , but didn \u2019 t succeed \u2014 then dispersed the rally and a counter-protest when they descended into violence .\nIn Charlottesville , the city government attempted to move the Unite the Right rally out of downtown ; the ACLU helped defend the rally , and a judge \u2019 s injunction Friday night allowed the original plan to remain in place . ( Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , meanwhile , urged both would-be rallygoers and would-be counter-protesters to stay away from downtown Charlottesville Saturday . )\nThe problem is that while the law sees a clear distinction between speech and action when it comes to violence \u2014 a peaceful Nazi rally is protected by the First Amendment \u2014 many of the people attending do not .\nThe recent right-wing resurgence has fed a rise in an American \u201c antifa \u201d ( short for \u201c anti-fascist \u201d ) movement , dedicated to violent resistance of ideologies that it sees as inherently violent ( or , in simpler terms , dedicated to punching Nazis ) . While the counter-protesters to Saturday \u2019 s Unite the Right rally planned peaceful resistance , some were prepared for self-defense ; local activist Emily Gorecenski told the Guardian that she was carrying a gun because \u201c The second amendment is one of the few civil rights I have left as a trans woman . \u201d\nAnd many rally participants , for their part , were more than willing to beat up counter-protesters \u2014 as was demonstrated during a related march Friday night on the campus of the University of Virginia , which devolved into a brawl when marchers assaulted counter-protesters around a statue of Thomas Jefferson .\nAfter stepping in somewhat belatedly on Friday , police officers took an aggressive stand Saturday to prevent the rally from going forward as planned . Both the city of Charlottesville and the state of Virginia declared states of emergency Saturday , minutes before the scheduled start time of the rally ( but after clashes had already begun ) . Shortly before noon , police assembled at the rally site and declared the assembly \u201c unlawful \u201d before the rally actually began , then moved immediately to disperse the crowd .\nThe park is evacuated . Confederates march past , but are ordered to disperse , shouting with police . The rally is over . pic.twitter.com/xmMkWKkfQb \u2014 Jack Smith IV ( @ JackSmithIV ) August 12 , 2017\nBut it \u2019 s too late to keep the Unite the Right rally from becoming violent ; to some , its concept was inherently violent , and few appear invested in stopping physical violence from erupting in its wake .",
