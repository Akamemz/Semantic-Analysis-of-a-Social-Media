    "content": "Donald Trump is embroiled in another media controversy , this time over his reaction when asked about the emotional speech at the Democratic National Convention by the bereaved parents of Capt . Humayun Khan , an immigrant soldier who died in Iraq in 2004 .\nAs noted here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the speech was a powerful rebuke , though factually incorrect : the Constitution does not bar religious tests for immigrants , for example .\nNow the media has dutifully weaponized the speech to attack him .\nIn an interview with Maureen Down of the New York Times , and again with former Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos of ABC News , Trump was asked to respond to the speech , which Khan \u2019 s father gave while his mother stood silently . He told Dowd , \u201c I \u2019 d like to hear his wife say something , \u201d referring to the subordinate status of women in Islam .\nTrump said the same to Stephanopoulos , adding that Khan \u2019 s father , Khizr Khan , \u201c looked like a nice guy to me , \u201d and defending his own \u201c sacrifices \u201d * for America . He suggested that the Clinton campaign had scripted Khan \u2019 s remarks \u2014 a charge the family later denied on MSNBC \u2014 and returned to his basic policy argument : \u201c We \u2019 ve had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism , that \u2019 s what I \u2019 d say . \u201d\nIn response , the usual freakout . Ezra Klein of Vox.com , for example , wrote an article headlined : \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s slander of Captain Humayun Khan \u2019 s family is horrifying , even for Trump . \u201d\nBut when bereaved Benghazi mother Patricia Smith spoke at the Republican convention the week before , one Vox.com writer called it an example of \u201c a longstanding Republican tendency of extreme overreach. \u201d Another said it was a \u201c scary \u201d appeal to the GOP base , \u201c a new crossing of a line and an ugly degradation of a norm in American politics. \u201d Another rushed to reassure Vox.com readers that \u201c no official inquest into Benghazi \u2014 and there have been many \u2014 has found evidence that Clinton is personally responsible for the events of that night. \u201d Another cited Smith \u2019 s speech , and the audience \u2019 s reaction ( \u201c lock her up ! \u201d ) , \u201c really disturbing. \u201d And another argued that \u201c spotlighting Smith felt a bit exploitive \u2014 and , at the same time , irrelevant . \u201d\nOther media outlets reacted the same way : PolitiFact rushed to \u201c fact-check \u201d Smith \u2019 s claims , though her story has been corroborated by other bereaved Benghazi parents .\nCould Trump have been more gracious ? Of course . But Clinton \u2014 whose negligence contributed to Sean Smith \u2019 s death \u2014 essentially called Patricia Smith a liar on national TV , and few in the media objected .
