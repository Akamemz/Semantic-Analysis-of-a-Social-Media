    "content": "\u201c Amy is dynamite , \u201d said former Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal , who has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden but attended a Klobuchar house party this past weekend in Council Bluffs . \u201c Who knows where it leads , but Iowans have spent the last six months getting to know these candidates , and now they \u2019 re in the position where they \u2019 re getting to make up their minds . \u201d\nSitting in the kitchen while Klobuchar met with supporters in the living room , Gronstal said of her , \u201c The surge is real . \u201d\nIf it is , it has yet to fully materialize . Klobuchar is polling at about 6 percent in Iowa and lower nationally . And this is not her first time catching a spark . Klobuchar raised $ 1 million in the day after the October Democratic presidential primary debate , too . \u201c Klomentum \u201d made its appearance in the political lexicon then , before fading .\nSnapping her fingers at a winery ( one , for the record , without a cave ) in Ida Grove on Sunday , she said , \u201c Things can change like that . \u201d\nIn recent weeks , Klobuchar has doubled the size of her operation in Iowa to nearly 80 staffers in the state . She has 18 offices , and after the latest debate , her campaign said she posted record days for caucus commitments and precinct captain recruitments .\nHer campaign is running TV ads in every market in the state and said it plans to remain on the air through the caucuses . She is raising money , and she is traveling to far-flung , conservative stretches of Iowa , including 27 counties over a four-day trip that ended Monday .\n\u201c Now we can pay for that bus ! \u201d Klobuchar told a small crowd of supporters at a coffee shop in Logan on Sunday when her green campaign bus pulled into view .\nJeff Link , a Democratic strategist in Iowa whose Focus on Rural America poll has had Klobuchar higher than most other surveys has , said , \u201c The big question is whether she can catch one of the four at the top . \u201d\nAs one of the field \u2019 s more centrist Democrats , Klobuchar \u2019 s success almost certainly relies on a Biden collapse . But Klobuchar \u2019 s advisers believe most Iowa voters are only now beginning to decide on a candidate , and her Midwest sensibilities and decency-based critiques of President Donald Trump wear well here .\nNorm Sterzenbach , a former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party , is advising her , after working for former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s failed presidential campaign . And the candidate herself playfully encouraged a late-night crowd in Council Bluffs to commit to her in the spirit of the holidays , or inebriation .\n\u201c Sign one of those commit-to-caucus [ cards ] , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s the holidays , you know , you never remember what happens the next morning , at a holiday party . Just sign one of those cards . \u201d\nHer opponents aren \u2019 t sure what to make of her movement following the debate . Crowd sizes \u2014 always an imprecise measure of enthusiasm \u2014 are even less instructive in the small , rural areas Klobuchar visited over the weekend . Yet about 50 people were waiting for her before dawn in a restaurant in rural Sheldon on Monday .\nStrategists working with several rival campaigns said they expected Klobuchar \u2019 s debate to result in at least some polling uptick in the state . And by the weekend , they were beginning to recirculate opposition research on Klobuchar \u2014 from old accusations of mistreatment by staff to her past support for some of President Donald Trump \u2019 s judicial nominees .\nOf her post-debate bump , an adviser to one candidate said , \u201c She hasn \u2019 t been attacked yet . I don \u2019 t think anyone \u2019 s going to let this stand . \u201d\nA strategist working with another candidate said he does not expect that Klobuchar will \u201c light it up anywhere , \u201d but that \u201c she \u2019 ll be viable in most places in the state , which is good for fourth . \u201d\nA fourth place finish would exceed expectations and mark a dramatic turn for Klobuchar . In an interview , she said it was difficult for her to gain traction earlier this year because \u201c it was such a crowded field . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 NEWSLETTERS \u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics .
