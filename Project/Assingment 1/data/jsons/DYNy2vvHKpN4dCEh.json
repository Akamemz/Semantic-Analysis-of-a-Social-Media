    "content": "Lots Of Candidates Want To Simplify Tax Code ; Here 's What They Get Wrong\nThere 's something almost Name That Tune-ish about the way the GOP candidates are talking about tax brackets these days . Currently , there are seven . Donald Trump wants four . Jeb Bush says he can get them down to three . Chris Christie and Marco Rubio want two . Ben Carson does them one better \u2014 one 10 percent rate , inspired by the Bible .\nThey 're not alone \u2014 President Obama has advocated fewer brackets as well .\nWhy do this ? One of the most common reasons they give is that it would make the tax code `` simpler . ''\nAs Rubio 's tax plan puts it : `` The tax code is in desperate need of simplification , and bracket consolidation is an important first step . ''\nHe 's right on the first part : The Internal Revenue Code is impenetrably , unfathomably complicated .\nBut here 's the reality : Cutting brackets wo n't really help that much .\n`` It 's a very mild form of simplification , '' said William Gale , co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution , a left-leaning Washington think tank . `` The real complication in the system is in the tax base , not in the rate structure . Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you 're eligible for the [ earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans ] , given the child rules \u2014 once you 've got that , then you just plug in the rates . ''\nThink about your own taxes \u2014 it can be complicated to figure out how much you owe when you have things like investment income , wages from self-employment or lots of deductions . But once you fill in the boxes and subtract all that out , figuring out your rate is easy ( and if you 're using a program like TurboTax , the computer does it for you ) .\nCutting taxes as a whole tends to be the real goal behind rate-cutting , said Ed Kleinbard , professor of law and business at the University of Southern California . After all , no one ever tries to simplify tax brackets upward .\n`` The number of brackets has an almost imperceptible effect on the complexity of tax law as it is lived by the individual taxpayer , '' Kleinbard said . `` Taxpayers are not , left to their own devices , engaged in high-level mathematics . ''\nSo reducing the number of brackets is n't the clearest path to simplification . What is ? Making the rest of your tax preparation experience easier , says one expert .\n`` [ Simplification ] does not necessarily mean that taxes are a simple mathematical function of income , '' said Matthew Weinzierl , a Harvard University assistant professor , who studies what optimal tax systems look like . `` After all , with TurboTax it 's easy to have a computer do a complex calculation for you . Instead , what economists typically have in mind is that a tax system should be easy to understand , transparent and hard to game . ''\nA lot of these bracket-cutting ideas come alongside proposals to limit deductions . And that , in its own right , is a great step toward simplification . Bush , for example , wants to cap the amount of total deductions most people can take ( not counting the charitable deduction ) .\n`` Most economists think a tax base with fewer such loopholes is less subject to evasion and less distortionary to economic activity , '' Weinzierl said .\nThe idea is that these loophole closures offset the tax revenue lost from cutting brackets . But that 's not how it always works .\n`` The call for fewer tax brackets in every case has as its real motive lowering the tax burden on the highest-income Americans , not making life simpler for the middle class , '' Kleinbard argued . Consider Bush 's tax proposal as an example . While it limits deductions , it also would overwhelmingly benefit the highest earners ( and grow the national debt \u2014 unless there is unprecedented growth in the economy ) .\nCutting deductions and loopholes makes for a great sound bite , but it 's far tougher than it sounds . The politically popular mortgage-interest deduction is a great example of this . It tends to benefit higher earners more , but despite constant calls to `` simplify '' the tax code , it 's so politically popular that it has proved impossible to eliminate .\nCutting deductions is n't the only way candidates could fight for simpler taxes . They could also pledge to combat efforts of tax preparers to keep tax preparation itself complicated . Vox 's Dylan Matthews and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ' Robert Greenstein have reported that H & R Block pushed for changes that would have quadrupled the earned income tax credit form 's length , making it harder for low-income families to get the credit ( that is , without H & R Block 's help ) . ( The company has defended itself here . )\nThere are also unsexy opportunities to make the code less complicated . For example , Kleinbard argues that some long , hyperspecific definitions could be trimmed down .\n`` If you really care about complexity , the place to look , for example , is the definition of who 's a dependent , '' Kleinbard said . `` People fight over whether a child is a dependent of one parent or another . It turns out to be an incredibly complicated topic , and nonsensically so . If you look for simplicity , you 'd actually want to look at things like a consistent and simple definition of 'dependent . ' ``\nSo there 's plenty of room for simplification , and politicians often point to the so-called 70,000 page tax code as proof of that . However , railing against the page count may be a misguided line of attack .\nOne ( nitpicky ) reason is that the tax code itself is not , in fact , 70,000 pages long , as Slate pointed out last year . That distinction belongs to a compilation of court decisions surrounding the tax code , according to the Tax Foundation . The statutes themselves are about 2,700 pages long .\nBut far more important , Kleinbard said , some complexity is inherent to a tax code that tries to govern a complicated economy .\n`` The tax code is thousands of pages long for a very simple reason : It is a model , in the economic sense , of all of economic activity , '' he said . `` Most Americans do n't spend a lot of time worrying about the taxation of cutting timber or of being crew on a tuna boat . But there are rules for that , and you may find the rules irrelevant to you , but the rules are complex for a reason . ''\nAmericans want a tax code that 's simpler to some degree .
