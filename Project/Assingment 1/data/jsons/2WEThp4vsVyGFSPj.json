''\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday that Walsh `` is expected to announce he is running for president as early as this weekend . '' He told The Times , `` If I do it , it 's going to be before Labor Day . ''\nWalsh went from passionately supporting President Trump 's candidacy in 2016 to regularly \u2014 and adamantly \u2014 speaking out against the president and calling him `` unfit '' for the office . The former congressman from Illinois told WTTW-TV this week that the turning point for him came when President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 .\n`` He lost me for sure , for good , at Helsinki , '' Walsh told the outlet . `` When he stood in front of the world last summer and said ' I believe that guy , Putin , and not my own people , ' that was disloyal , that was un-American , and , again , no Republican should support that . ''\nSince the Helsinki meeting , Walsh has ramped up his public rebukes of the president , and penned an op-ed for The New York Times last week wherein he argued that `` Trump needs a primary challenge . ''\nBut Walsh has a tough row to hoe in presenting any significant threat to President Trump according to the current political landscape , where the president enjoys strong polling numbers from Republican voters and the `` undivided '' support of the Republican National Committee .\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh , when asked by The Times for his reaction to Walsh 's potential candidacy , replied : `` Certain failure .
