Why Obama picked Hagel\nPresident Barack Obama \u2019 s decision to nominate Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense has mystified lawmakers from both parties .\nDemocrats don \u2019 t love the former Nebraska senator because he \u2019 s a Republican . Republicans don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s a real Republican . And his past statements have at times angered two key Obama constituencies : Jewish groups and gay-rights activists .\nBut inside the White House , the choice makes sense . It appeals to Obama \u2019 s bipartisan spirit \u2014 and the optics aren \u2019 t bad , either \u2014 to have any Republican as Defense secretary when Obama is seeking to end the war in Afghanistan and dramatically reduce the Pentagon \u2019 s budget . Hagel brings even more credibility to the task because he \u2019 s a decorated Vietnam veteran and would be the first from that war to lead the Pentagon .\nHagel also has long-standing relationships with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden dating to their time in the Senate , and he \u2019 s a particularly close friend of Biden \u2019 s .\nDefense isn \u2019 t the first high-level post the White House has discussed with Hagel : An individual who speaks regularly with Hagel said the White House has spoken with him about becoming Commerce secretary and CIA director , among other jobs . During Obama \u2019 s first term , Hagel has been in regular contact with the White House on foreign policy issues as co-chairman of Obama \u2019 s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta \u2019 s Defense Policy Board .\nThere \u2019 s still no evidence that any Democratic senators will vote against an Obama-nominated Hagel , and tradition holds that senators get an easy ride when up for Cabinet posts . Despite the vocal objections of a few GOP senators , only three have explicitly said they will vote against Hagel .\nHagel cost himself capital among Republicans for bucking party orthodoxy , but the White House is prepared for a fight over the GOP \u2019 s past foreign policy positions .\n\u201c If at the end of the day these guys are frustrated that he had the courage to buck his party on the Iraq War , that \u2019 s going to be a tough case to make to the American people , \u201d White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said .\nLongtime Obama confidant and political adviser David Axelrod tweeted Sunday night that \u201c Attacks on Hagel r bogus . He \u2019 s tough , courageous , sensible & able to withstand political pressure to do what \u2019 s right for USA . What we need ! \u201d\nMike Buttry , Hagel \u2019 s former chief of staff , previewed how Hagel might defend himself against criticism by GOP senators during the confirmation process . Buttry said Hagel is \u201c not blind \u201d to the opposition to his nomination .\n\u201c He always just did what he thought was right . He always was trying to do what he thought was the right thing and never gave much thought into how it might be received , \u201d Buttry told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday . \u201c He \u2019 s thinking about , \u2018 What do I have to do to do this job the best way I can do it ? \u2019 \u201d\nBoth Obama and Biden have traveled to war zones with Hagel \u2014 Obama during his summer 2008 Iraq and Afghanistan trips as the Democratic presidential nominee . But Hagel \u2019 s relationship with Biden runs much deeper and is more personal , a result of their 12-year bond from serving together in the Senate , including on the Foreign Relations Committee , Buttry said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re just friends , they \u2019 re very close , \u201d Buttry said of Hagel and Biden . \u201c They \u2019 ve traveled together , their families get along . There \u2019 s just a closeness there . They \u2019 ve worked on legislation together . It \u2019 s like any kind of friendship , they \u2019 re just two guys who clicked together . \u201d\nFor the White House , the political dynamics surrounding the Hagel nomination are different than those for Susan Rice , another longtime friend of Obama who removed herself from consideration for secretary of state in December , she said , to spare the president . She was concerned Republican anger over her role in the Benghazi attacks would distract from his second-term agenda .\n\u201c It was clear from early on that many in Congress , especially Republicans , were going to make a witch hunt and an example out of Susan Rice , \u201d a person close to Obama said . \u201c I think that the Rice case was obviously a case where it would seemingly have been an insurmountable challenge . \u201d\nWhite House officials said Hagel has a clearer path toward confirmation . Still , a major fight over Hagel could lead to many of the same distractions Rice sought to avoid \u2014 tripping up other major items on the president \u2019 s agenda , including immigration , the economy and now gun control .\nObama has made the calculation that the long-term benefits are worth the immediate battle .\nThe White House believes Hagel \u2019 s Senate record will overcome trouble about controversial statements Hagel has made , such as his 2006 reference to a \u201c Jewish lobby. \u201d Talking points dated Dec. 19 \u2014 written and being circulated in Washington by Hagel allies \u2014 say he has \u201c an unbroken record of substantive support for Israel . \u201d\nAxelrod wrote Sunday that \u201c supporters of Israel , of which I am one , also make a huge mistake by depicting Hagel as hostile .

Hagel would be the first defense secretary who served as an enlisted man \u2014 an idea that will be popular with the troops , the official said , and Hagel \u2019 s defenders are sure to emphasize that he earned two Purple Hearts and still carries shrapnel in his chest .\nThat record , Obama \u2019 s allies say , gives Hagel credibility as a leader who can cut Pentagon spending and bring home American troops from overseas .\n\u201c This is a challenging time in the world , and there are going to be tough cuts that need to be made , \u201d said Jen Psaki , Obama \u2019 s campaign spokeswoman . \u201c One of the tasks of the next secretary of defense is to see that through , and clearly Mr. Hagel is somebody who has been through it .
