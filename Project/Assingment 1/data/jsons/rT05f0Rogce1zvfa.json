    "content": "A strange madness is gripping the federal judiciary . It is in the process of crafting a new standard of judicial review , one that does violence to existing precedent , good sense , and even national security for the sake of defeating Donald Trump . We \u2019 ll call this new jurisprudence \u201c Trumplaw , \u201d and its latest victim is once again the so-called Trump travel ban . The perpetrator is the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals .\nThis afternoon , the Fourth Circuit upheld a nationwide injunction on Trump \u2019 s temporary halt on immigration from six majority-Muslim countries \u2014 each of which is either a state sponsor of terrorism ( Sudan and Iran ) or overrun with terrorist violence , with entire regions under jihadist control ( Libya , Yemen , Syria , and Somalia ) . Indeed , some of these countries no longer have a recognizably functional government .\nHere is the essence of the court \u2019 s ruling : Trump \u2019 s campaign statements were so grotesque that they not only ( 1 ) hurt the feelings of a Muslim resident so much that he was granted standing to challenge an executive order that did not apply to him , but also ( 2 ) rendered an otherwise lawful executive order so damaging that the harm to the plaintiff \u2019 s feelings ( and his wife \u2019 s possibly delayed entry into the United States ) outweigh the government \u2019 s asserted national-security interest in pausing to reexamine foreign entry from hostile and war-torn countries .\nSince Trumplaw is such a novel form of jurisprudence , it \u2019 s exceedingly hard to square with existing precedent . So , when existing precedent either doesn \u2019 t apply or cuts against the overriding demand to stop Trump , then it \u2019 s up to the court to yank that law out of context , misinterpret it , and then functionally rewrite it to reach the \u201c right \u201d result .\nTake , for example , the Fourth Circuit \u2019 s reading of a Supreme Court case called Kleindienst v. Mandel . In Mandel , a collection of scholars demanded that the U.S. grant a non-immigrant visa to Belgian Marxist journalist . The government had denied him entry under provisions of American law excluding those who advocated or published \u201c the economic , international , and governmental doctrines of world communism. \u201d Make no mistake , the First Amendment protects the right to advocate or publish Marxist doctrines every bit as much as it protects the free exercise of the Islamic faith . Yet the Supreme Court still ruled against the Belgian journalist :\nWe hold that , when the Executive exercises [ its ] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason , the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion , nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant .\nThe meaning is clear . If the order is supported by legitimate and bona fide reasons on its face , you simply don \u2019 t go beyond the document . By that standard , the executive order is easily and clearly lawful . On its face , the order asserts a legitimate and bona fide national-security justification . On its face , the order isn \u2019 t remotely a Muslim ban . On its face it doesn \u2019 t target the Muslim faith in any way , shape , or form . On its face it describes exactly why each nation is included . The Fourth Circuit , however , interpreted Mandel to argue that the Court looked only at the face of the document to determine whether its supporting reasons were legitimate , not whether they were \u201c bona fide. \u201d It could go \u201c behind \u201d the document to determine \u201c good faith . \u201d\nYet , as the dissent notes , this approach would have altered the outcome not only in Mandel itself , but also in other key Supreme Court cases .
