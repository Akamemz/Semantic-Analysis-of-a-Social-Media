Here's everything you need to know:\n\nHow does South Korea compare with the U.S.?\n\nBoth countries saw their first corona\u00advirus cases on the same day, Jan. 20.

It started developing and stockpiling test kits in early January, as soon as Chinese scientists released the virus's genetic code and before a single Korean had been infected.\n\nHow did they know to do that?\n\nAn outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea in 2015 exposed vulnerabilities that terrified the populace and forced an overhaul of epidemic response. A single patient infected with MERS \u2014 caused by a different coronavirus than the one that causes COVID-19 \u2014 brought it in from the Middle East, was treated at three hospitals, and sparked outbreaks in each one, infecting 186 people and killing 38.

South Koreans learned that because any new virus can spread exponentially, stamping out each new outbreak quickly is the key to avoiding catastrophic growth.\n\nHow did they react this time?\n\nJust three days after news broke on Dec. 31 of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan, China, the KCDC set up a response team to study the virus. Once the first case appeared, authorities started tracking the health of some 3,000 people who had traveled to Wuhan over the previous two weeks.

Over 10 days, cases soared from fewer than 50 to more than 5,000. South Korea quickly surged its testing to some 20,000 people a day, but it also took more extreme measures.\n\nWhat were these?\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in allowed the use of invasive surveillance tactics to track worshippers at Shincheonji churches across the country.

All were previously hit by the 2003 epidemic of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a terrifying 10 percent fatality rate.
