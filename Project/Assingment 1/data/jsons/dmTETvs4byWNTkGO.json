Romney .\nAfter warring with the president during the 2016 campaign , Romney has struck a delicate balance lately \u2014 offering praise for some of Trump \u2019 s policies while bluntly criticizing his bombastic style . But at a time when Trump \u2019 s \u201c America First \u201d and populist-driven approach has overtaken the party , Romney \u2019 s preliminary planning has led to mounting expectations among allies that he \u2019 ll try to be a counterweight to the president \u2014 at least occasionally \u2014 and to fill a gaping vacuum in mainstream GOP leadership .\nThe void will grow even wider with the retirements of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake and House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) , each of whom Romney has been in touch with . Arizona Sen. John McCain , the 2008 nominee and the party \u2019 s foremost proponent of a hawkish foreign policy , is in declining health .\nJohn Miller , a real estate executive and Romney 2012 finance chair who recently met with the former Massachusetts governor in Salt Lake City , said he is convinced that Romney would strive to cut a McCain-like figure in the Senate .\n\u201c I do not see him as being a passive politician , \u201d Miller said .\nTo some , the idea that Romney , a 71-year-old multimillionaire who appeared to be done with politics following his 2012 defeat , wants to be a senator is hard to fathom . With his onetime nemesis Trump dominating the party , Republicans bracing for losses in the midterm elections and the upper congressional chamber marred by dysfunction , the former governor confronts a seemingly undesirable political landscape .\nAs he delivered remarks here Thursday night before a group of Republican Party donors gathered for his annual E2 Summit , Romney seemed to acknowledge the grim reality .\n\u201c You may wonder why in the world I \u2019 m involved in politics again , \u201d he joked darkly .\nYet those close to Romney say his return is in no small part guided by a desire to fill a hole in the mainstream GOP hierarchy that \u2019 s been decimated by Trump .\n`` Mitt is the voice , the face of the Republican Party , \u201d said Scott Keller , a Utah real estate executive who recently hosted a fundraiser for Romney . \u201c I absolutely expect him to fill in for the folks that are leaving . ''\nAmong those Romney has spoken with has been the retiring Corker \u2014 who , like Romney , has at times found himself in open combat with Trump .\nDuring a recent phone call , Corker and Romney \u2014 who Trump briefly considered for secretary of state before ultimately tapping Rex Tillerson \u2014 discussed the former governor \u2019 s interest in foreign affairs .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s going to be a player , personally , in foreign relations , \u201d said Corker , who has spent the past 3 1/2years holding the gavel of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee . \u201c I think he has an interest there , and I think that \u2019 s a place where he might make a mark . \u201d\nDuring his Thursday night appearance , Romney did not explicitly address what role he might play in the Senate . But his remarks included an ominous warning on the danger posed by Russia , China and militant jihadists . And he weighed in at length on the deficit .\n\u201c How are we going to be competitive globally if we \u2019 re paying hundreds of billions , ultimately a trillion , paying off former debts ? \u201d Romney asked . \u201c And we don \u2019 t seem to be making much progress on that . \u201d\nHe didn \u2019 t mention Trump , but it wasn \u2019 t hard to see the contrast . Trump , his critics charge , has presided over budget-busting policies while seeming to cozy up to authoritarian leaders like Russia \u2019 s Vladimir Putin .\nRomney is expected to accelerate his Senate planning following the June 26 primary , when he faces off against Mike Kennedy , an underfunded conservative state representative . The general election in the Republican-dominated state is widely seen as an afterthought .\nKennedy , who has cast Romney as a flip-flopper and insufficiently supportive of the president , edged out the former governor at the activist-driven state GOP convention . Yet Kennedy has struggled to gain traction in public polling ahead of the primary , which is expected to attract a broader swath of the Republican electorate .\nSince launching his campaign in February , Romney has waged an aggressive effort to lock down the nomination .
