    "content": "Despite rumblings of boycotts ahead of his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday morning , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with roaring applause and standing room only attendance as he entered the U.S. Senate Chamber.Before addressing the threat of a nuclear Iran , Netanyahu tried to clear up the misconception his visit was political after the White House condemned his invitation from House Speaker John Boehner , which was extended without President Obama \u2019 s consent . He also thanked Congress for their support of Israel \u2019 s Iron Dome. \u201c My friends , I am deeply humbled by the opportunity to speak for a third time before the most important legislative body in the world , the US Congress , \u201d Netanyahu said . \u201c Some perceived my being here as political , that was never my intention. \u201d \u201c I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for your support for Israel , year after year , decade after decade , \u201d he continued , saying the relationship has always been above politics and should remain there . \u201c I know that no matter which side of the aisle you sit , you stand with Israel. \u201d During his address , Netanyahu described the failure to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon as a \u201c countdown to a nuclear nightmare , \u201d and said he has a \u201c profound obligation \u201d to warn against the current deal the White House is working on with the Iranian regime. \u201c This is a bad deal , it \u2019 s a very bad deal , we \u2019 re better off without it , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re told that the alternative to this deal is war . That \u2019 s just not true . The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal . \u201d\nNetanyahu said he does not believe the current deal being negotiated will do anything to change Iran \u2019 s long held violent behavior and called on Congress and the White House to demand Iran stop its aggression against it \u2019 s neighbors in the Middle East , stop supporting terrorism around the world and to stop threatening the annihilation of Israel . He also reminded lawmakers of Iran \u2019 s responsibility in maiming and killing thousands of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .\n\u201c If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country , let it act like a normal country , \u201d he said , arguing Iran \u2019 s nuclear program can be rolled back more significantly than what \u2019 s being proposed in the current deal between the White House and the regime. \u201c I don \u2019 t believe Iran \u2019 s radical regime will change for the better after this deal , \u201d Netanyahu said . \u201c Its rapid appetite for aggression grows more every year\u2026This deal will not change Iran for the better , it will change the Middle East for the worse . \u201d\nJust as he did in his speech to AIPAC yesterday in Washington D.C. , Netanyahu hinted that Israel will take on Iran by itself , if necessary , to prevent the regime \u2019 s nuclear program from moving forward , but expressed hope America wouldn \u2019 t force the Jewish State to do it alone .\n\u201c The days of the Jewish people remaining passive in the face of genocidal enemies , those days are over , \u201d Netanyahu said . \u201c Even if Israel has to stand alone , Israel will stand . \u201d\n\u201c I know that Israel does not stand alone , I know that America stands with Israel , \u201d he added .",
