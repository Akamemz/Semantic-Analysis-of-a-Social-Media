Donald Trump is a phenomenon . Barack Obama was a phenomenon . A phenomenon is a \u201c happening \u201d or an \u201c experience. \u201d It doesn \u2019 t happen much folks , but it \u2019 s happening now . So get ready for the ride of a lifetime .\nThe point is all the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can \u2019 t stop a political phenomenon when it \u2019 s pulling out of the Trump Train station .\nAll the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can \u2019 t stop a political phenomenon when it \u2019 s pulling out of the Trump Train station .\nNobody was going to beat Barack Obama in 2008 . That \u2019 s a fact . It was his moment . It wasn \u2019 t that John McCain ran a bad campaign , or picked the wrong VP . It was just that it didn \u2019 t matter , it was over when it started . It has to do with understanding your moment , reading the populace , knowing that they want exactly the opposite of what they \u2019 ve had in the White House . They want a charismatic candidate to match what they are feeling and promise to give them exactly the big fat cheeseburger they \u2019 ve been wanting ever since they went on that awful diet .\nMichelle Obama told her husband it was Iowa or bust for them . She knew that if they couldn \u2019 t win Iowa , they couldn \u2019 t win America , but if they could \u2013 there would be no stopping them . She told her husband it was now or never and that she would only do this thing once . Even though he was a new senator , she correctly assessed this was their \u201c Moment \u201d and they would not get a redo . She was absolutely right on .\nThe country was war weary and the handsome young Senator promised \u201c Hope and Change. \u201d Political pendulums swing hard and feed on stark contrast . He was not a Bush and not a Clinton . Not at all . In fact , he was Barack Hussein Obama . He was Kennedy-esque , with a young attractive family . He was Bobby Kennedy \u2019 s dream of how the Civil Rights movement crescendos . He was the man who perfectly matched the mood , and he grabbed it . That \u2019 s what it \u2019 s all about .\nJust ask Governor Chris Christie , who missed his moment . Had he run against Barack Obama in 2012 , he would have won . The tough talking New Jersey Governor was getting a ton of attention in 2011 . He \u2019 d shockingly won a blue state governor \u2019 s race when the odds were stacked against him . He was \u201c telling it like it is \u201d to anybody who crossed him . He shouted down Teacher \u2019 s Unions for depriving kids of the education they deserved . He told firefighters and policeman that the pensions they \u2019 d been promised would never arrive , if they weren \u2019 t willing to give back a little to keep the programs solvent . These YouTube hits were going viral , getting coverage . The portly governor with his tie askew was the opposite of the snappily dressed lean and eloquent president , who \u2019 d lost his shine a bit , four years in .\nBut while GOP leaders begged Christie to run , he demurred . He said he wasn \u2019 t ready . It wasn \u2019 t his time . But as it turns out , it was . And he never got it back .\nSo now we have had 8 years of ObamaCare and Obamanomics . Eight years of promising to end the \u201c Era of War \u201d .\nStill we are mired in rising costs , stunted economic growth and an epic battle with an enemy that is a \u201c He Who Shall Not be Named. \u201d Except that everybody knows his name is Radical Islamist Terrorist .\nIn fairness , the president \u2019 s approval numbers have risen of late to 51 percent , many are satisfied . However , it may have something to do with the tenor of the sloppy primaries that have given him almost \u201c former president \u201d nostalgia points already . Still there is an undeniable restlessness in the country . We see it in the crowds who turn out in droves for Bernie and Donald .\nAs long as it took for Republicans to see , Donald Trump is the perfect storm of message \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d ( genius simplicity ) and Man . This brash businessman , Anti-Obama sold his brand brilliantly with his huge success on \u201c The Apprentice. \u201d Now Reality TV meets politics . I bet Mark Burnett wishes he \u2019 d thought of it . He was from the beginning the guy we all already knew . Love him or hate him , he leapt over the \u2018 name recognition \u2019 hurdle like it was a parking curb . And it didn \u2019 t even cost him a dime .\nBut surely he would not abide the rigor and tedium of the Campaign Trail . What would he do fly his jet all around the country ? Yes . Stay at Holiday Inns in places that don \u2019 t have Trump Hotels , um yes .\nSurely this rich guy , wouldn \u2019 t have a way with voters . He \u2019 d rather be in his Tower , as his beautiful wife sips champagne ( he doesn \u2019 t drink ) , not out there in flyover state diners and arenas pressing the flesh . Wrong . He would say scandalous things ! Yes . Just think of all the tape and tabloid that already existed on this guy ? There would be no way he \u2019 d get away with it .
