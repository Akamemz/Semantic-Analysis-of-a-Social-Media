    "content": "After 24-year-old De \u2019 janay Lenorra Stanton was found fatally wounded last August on the South Side of Chicago , the story received nationwide attention . This was not because homicide is rare in Chicago , where 589 people were murdered in 2018 , nor was the method of Stanton \u2019 s death \u2014 a single gunshot to the head \u2014 newsworthy in a city notorious for armed violence . Rather , what made this crime a subject of national attention was a matter of identity and presumed motive . Stanton \u2019 s murder highlighted \u201c the urgent need to address the epidemic of violence against the transgender community across the U.S. , \u201d declared Helen Parshall of the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign . \u201c Stanton \u2019 s death marks the 18th known killing of a transgender or non-binary person this year , \u201d Parshall wrote , bemoaning \u201c this tragic epidemic \u201d of anti-transgender violence .\nThis theme was reiterated in other coverage of Stanton \u2019 s death . \u201c Transgender women face considerably high rates of violence in comparison to cisgender women , though that risk is even higher for trans women of color like De \u2019 janay , \u201d Leila Ettachfini wrote on the feminist site Broadly , citing research by activist groups : \u201c For many transgender women of color , the threat of violence is constant . \u201d\nEvery time such a murder is reported , the media repeats and elaborates this message , as in the case of the recent murder of Dana Martin in Montgomery , Alabama , which was reported by the New York Times : \u201c At least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018 , the majority of them black transgender women , according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2017 , advocates reported at least 29 transgender people fatally shot or killed by other violent means . \u201d\nPolice in Montgomery say they have no suspects in the murder of Martin , who was found shot death in a car Jan. 6 , thus becoming \u201c the first known transgender person killed this year in the United States. \u201d A local LGBT activist told the Times that murders of \u201c trans people of color are just happening more and more often and very little is being done about it. \u201d This is self-evidently false , as even the statistics cited by activist groups indicate that the number of such crimes declined about 10 % in the past year , despite the rhetoric about an \u201c epidemic \u201d of anti-transgender violence . As to the question of what is \u201c being done about it , \u201d the police in Montgomery , as in other cities , say they \u2019 re doing their best . There were more than 17,000 homicides in the United States in 2017 , the most recent year for which Justice Department figures are available , and the reported number of transgender victims was a minuscule fraction of a single percentage point of those murders . No one should imagine , of course , that the liberal media and activist organizations have suddenly taken an interest in supporting the law enforcement community and urging them to bring criminals to justice . No , all the noise about an alleged \u201c epidemic \u201d of anti-transgender violence is about blaming President Trump .\nLast year , Beverly Tillery , executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project , declared in a Huffington Post column : \u201c Many people have asked if the current regressive political climate legitimized by the language and policies of the Trump administration and others could be contributing to the rise of hate violence . Our answer is yes.\u2026 Over and over , President Donald Trump and his administration have attempted to erase , demonize and discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. \u201d Tillery was one of the sources quoted this week by CNN \u2019 s Jen Christensen parroting the claims of transgender activists that \u201c violence against the community is getting worse , \u201d and pointing the finger of blame directly at the White House :\nActivists say anti-trans rhetoric stigmatizes the community and raises the risk of violence . \u2026 Tillery , of the New York City Anti-Violence Project , feels that Trump has created a \u201c really scary time for the whole LGBTQ community. \u201d \u201c Every week , there is another news event that is equally triggering and terrifying , that leaves people not knowing where they can be safe . They are left with an uncertain future in this country , \u201d Tillery said . \u201c When you dehumanize people and try to erase them completely from existence , it emboldens those who hate this community , and no one is really stopping them , aside from the community rising up . \u201d\nOf course , we must keep in mind the fact that the reported number of transgender homicides has actually decreased since Trump became president , but also note that the national media didn \u2019 t bother paying attention to such crimes until after he was elected . We don \u2019 t actually know how many transgender people were murdered during Barack Obama \u2019 s eight years in the White House , because it wasn \u2019 t until Trump was elected that liberal journalists started hunting for evidence of a \u201c climate of hate \u201d they could blame on the Republican president .\nEven if one were willing to stipulate , arguendo , that Trump is guilty of \u201c anti-trans rhetoric \u201d or otherwise responsible for creating a \u201c really scary time for the whole LGBTQ community , \u201d however , such claims are a non sequitur when we examine the motives and circumstances in cases that constitute the alleged evidence of a \u201c climate of hate. \u201d Consider an October 2017 murder that occurred in Nueces County , Texas . Sheriff \u2019 s officers responded to a call and found the body of 47-year-old Juan Montes , also known as \u201c Stephanie Montez. \u201d According to the initial report in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times newspaper , \u201c Medical examiner Heraldo Pena said authorities initially believed the person was a woman ; the person was wearing a dress and make up . They discovered later the person was male and that he had been shot in the chest , abdomen and a shoulder . \u201d\nThat report inspired indignation among activists who complained \u201c Stephanie \u201d had been \u201c deadnamed \u201d and \u201c misgendered , \u201d as if this were worse than being shot to death . However , Juan/ \u201c Stephanie \u201d had not undergone sex-change surgery and had male genitalia , and he had not legally changed his name , but such facts mean nothing to activists whose lives are apparently organized around being perpetually outraged over perceived anti-transgender prejudice . The national media eagerly pander to these activists and their counter-factual ideology , which explains why the death of \u201c Stephanie Montez \u201d was featured in a Nov. 10 , 2017 , New York Times article headlined , \u201c Violence Against Transgender People Is on the Rise , Advocates Say. \u201d The article quoted the ubiquitous Beverly Tillery as an authority for the assertion that there had been \u201c a spike in incidents of hate violence \u201d since Trump \u2019 s election : \u201c There is an increased climate of hate that is , in some cases , being allowed to grow . \u201d\nUnfortunately for the climate-of-hate theorists , the facts in the Nueces County murder of Juan/ \u201c Stephanie \u201d contradicted their theory . Four people \u2014 Cedric Green , 39 , Randy Dorsey , 41 , Chloe Huehlefeld , 36 , and Jace Montange , 22 \u2014 were charged in connection with the shooting . Prosecutors say Green had previously sold drugs to Juan/ \u201c Stephanie \u201d and that Green organized the murder plot because he suspected Juan/ \u201c Stephanie \u201d of having stolen $ 20 \u2014 four rolls of dimes \u2014 from his girlfriend , Huehlefeld . Both Green and Huehlefeld were subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison ; Dorsey was sentenced to 10 years \u2019 probation after accepting a plea bargain in return for testifying against his co-defendants ; the trial of Montange has been delayed . Anyone who cares to research this crime must conclude it had nothing to do with \u201c anti-trans rhetoric \u201d or a \u201c climate of hate , \u201d nor is there any reason to believe Cedric Green and his crew were Trump supporters .\nOf course , the New York Times never followed up to inform its readers of the outcome of the \u201c Stephanie Montez \u201d case . This is a discernible pattern in national media coverage of such cases . A transgender victim is murdered , activists draw attention to the crime , national media report it with quotes from activists decrying the \u201c epidemic of violence \u201d supposedly inspired by \u201c hate \u201d and then\u2026 silence . You can hear the crickets chirping while you wait for the national media to report on the outcomes of these cases , once police put the cuffs on a suspect . Over and over , these crimes become strictly local news after it is determined that the murdered transgender person was killed for something as squalid as the stolen $ 20 in dimes that led to the murder of Juan/ \u201c Stephanie \u201d in Nueces County .\nFor example , in June 2017 , it was reported that 17-year-old Rayquann Deonte Jernigan , a/k/a \u201c Ava Le \u2019 Ray Barrin , \u201d had become the \u201c Youngest Trans Murder Victim In The U.S . This Year. \u201d Was this murder caused by a Trump-inspired \u201c climate of hate \u201d ? No , according to police in Athens , Georgia , this fatal shooting was \u201c the culmination of a feud between two transgender groups. \u201d A judge dismissed a murder charge against the accused shooter , ruling that Jalen Breon Brown , 21 , acted in self-defense during a fight with Jernigan . Or what about the March 2018 murder of Darrel \u201c Amia Tyrae \u201d Berryman in Louisiana ? The Human Rights Campaign reported that Berryman , \u201c a transgender woman of color , \u201d had become \u201c the seventh known homicide of a transgender person this year. \u201d Was Berryman killed by a Republican voter ? No , the police charged Dedrick Butler , a 22-year-old convicted felon , with murdering Berryman in a $ 55-a-night East Baton Rouge motel room where \u201c Amia Tyrae \u201d was working as a prostitute .\nQuite frankly , many of these murder victims seem to spend a lot of time in bad neighborhoods hanging around bad people who do bad things . If it weren \u2019 t for activists promoting the \u201c climate of hate \u201d narrative , and a liberal media establishment eager to seize on these crimes for anti-Trump propaganda purposes , homicides like these would never be more than local news . But the activists have their agenda , and so when police found De \u2019 janay Lenorra Stanton shot in the head last August , the victim \u2019 s name was added to the roll honored on the \u201c Transgender Day of Remembrance \u201d in November . When police arrested a suspect last week , however , it was strictly local news .\nAccording to police , Stanton had been having sex with a 17-year-old named Tremon Hill , \u201c a lanky Phillips High School student who\u2026 played on the school \u2019 s basketball team. \u201d Hill was concerned about some photos he had sent to Stanton and was reportedly suicidal over his involvement with Stanton , who worked as a prostitute . The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday : \u201c Stanton received a text from Hill the morning of her killing asking her to meet him \u201d in a parking lot , according to the prosecutor . \u201c Just after 11 a.m. , Hill is alleged to have shot Stanton in the head and left her lying on the ground outside of her car . \u201d\nNot a Trump voter . Just a high-school kid distraught about his involvement with a 24-year-old transvestite prostitute . This doesn \u2019 t fit the media \u2019 s \u201c climate of hate \u201d myth , of course , and so it \u2019 s strictly local news . Tune in to CNN and you can hear the crickets chirping .",
