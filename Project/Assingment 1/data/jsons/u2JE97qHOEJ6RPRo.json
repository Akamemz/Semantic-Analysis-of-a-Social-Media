But the drill was basically the same . The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes , then returned to their offices . And Tester walked away with $ 26,400 in checks .\nJon Tester didn \u2019 t come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon . The US senator , virtually unknown in Boston , was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit , a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians .\nBut a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010 . Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a \u201c bonus \u201d that exactly equaled his $ 2,400 contribution to Tester \u2019 s campaign , the maximum allowed . A few days later , partner Garrett Bradley \u2014 until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill \u2014 got a bonus , too , exactly matching his $ 2,400 gift to Tester .\nThis pattern of payments \u2014 contributions offset by bonus payments \u2014 was commonplace at Thornton , according to a review of law firm records by the Spotlight Team and the Center for Responsive Politics , a Washington-based nonprofit that tracks campaign finance data .\nFrom 2010 through 2014 , Strouss and Bradley , along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife , donated nearly $ 1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians \u2014 from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts . Over the same span , the lawyers received $ 1.4 million listed as \u201c bonuses \u201d in Thornton Law Firm records ; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days .\nThat payback system , which involved other partners as well , helped make Thornton the 11th-ranked law firm nationally for political contributions in 2014 , according to data analyzed by the center , even though it is not among the 100 largest in Massachusetts .\nThornton , through a spokesman , said its donation reimbursement program was reviewed by outside lawyers and complied with applicable laws . Campaign finance experts said that without reviewing the firm \u2019 s records , they can not say the payback system breaks the law , but that it raises numerous red flags .\nThat \u2019 s because reimbursing people for their political donations is generally illegal , several experts said . When political donors are repaid for their donations , it can conceal the real source of contributions , and enable the unnamed source of the funds to exceed state and federal contribution limits . And in some states \u2014 Massachusetts among them \u2014 political donations to state candidates from corporations and partnerships such as Thornton Law Firm are flatly illegal .\nReimbursing donors is \u201c among the most serious campaign violations , in the view of both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice , \u201d said Daniel Petalas , an attorney who served as acting general counsel of the FEC until September .\nUS Senator Jon Tester came to Boston for a fund-raiser in 2010 . He raised $ 26,400 . That same day , Thornton Law Firm partner David C. Strouss received a $ 2,400 bonus \u2014 it equaled his contribution to Tester . Michael Albans/Associated Press/File 2012\n\u201c Using straw donors to make contributions is illegal , \u201d said Larry Noble , general counsel of the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center and a former general counsel of the FEC . \u201c People can go and have gone to prison for this . \u201d\nThornton officials declined to comment , instead hiring a former federal prosecutor to respond to the Globe \u2019 s questions .\nThe ex-prosecutor , Brian Kelly , said the bonuses should not have been called bonuses at all because they were paid from the lawyers \u2019 own money . He said an accountant deducted the payments from their equity , or ownership , in the firm . When lawyers leave Thornton Law and cash in their equity , he said , their financial settlement with Thornton would be reduced by the amount of the bonuses .\nKelly provided a written statement from Michael Thornton saying that \u201c an error made internally \u201d led to the payments being called bonuses . Thornton said he changed the way they were labeled in 2015 , several years into the program , when he discovered the mistake .\n\u201c It \u2019 s obviously not a crime to make lots of donations to politicians , and they certainly did that , \u201d said Kelly . \u201c But their donation program was vetted by prior counsel and an outside accountant , and the firm made every effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulations . \u201d\nHowever , campaign finance experts were skeptical about the system Kelly describes , saying it could allow partners to go years before repaying the firm for the bonuses . Regulators could view the bonuses as open-ended loans , they said , making them hidden , illegal donations from the firm .\n\u201c I think they need to be very careful , \u201d said James Kahl , former deputy general counsel of the FEC . \u201c The big red flag is monies being advanced , and the truing up doesn \u2019 t happen for many years . \u201d\nKelly , who has given varying explanations of the reimbursement policy since first being asked about it in July , declined to provide a copy of a legal opinion that he said justified the repayment program . He also declined to say whether lawyers who left the firm were required to pay when the bonuses they received exceeded their equity in the firm .\nBut one thing is certain : The policy was so complicated that some lawyers at the firm didn \u2019 t understand it , said former employees . They were just happy to get their money back .\nMichael Thornton , a former Marine who served in Vietnam , made his name in the law by becoming a national leader in handling asbestos-related cases , especially those in which victims developed mesothelioma , a deadly cancer caused by asbestos exposure . Thornton lawyers have handled thousands of such cases , made millions of dollars , and even helped to underwrite research into mesothelioma .\nBut that pipeline of profits was threatened just over a decade ago when some leading politicians , including President George W. Bush , moved to limit damages in class action lawsuits and to allow the victims of asbestos exposure to file their claims for compensation directly to a national trust fund \u2014 bypassing lawyers who typically receive a third of any award .\nThe firm \u2019 s partners contributed heavily to mostly Democratic politicians who , they hoped , would thwart efforts to create the trust fund .\n\u201c If it passed , the firm would close , \u201d said a former employee who feared retaliation if his name were used . \u201c Hence , the beginning of the political donations . \u201d\nThey gave more and more each year , from $ 257,300 to federal candidates and the Democratic Party in the 2003-2004 election cycle to nearly $ 1.1 million a decade later , according to the center \u2014 quadrupling their contributions .\nThornton is a small firm \u2014 usually 10 or fewer equity partners \u2014 but the lawyers punch well above their weight in political fund-raising .\nIn the two-year election cycle ending in 2014 , for example , lawyers at Thornton Naumes , as the firm was then called , donated more than much larger multinational firms such as Greenberg Traurig , a Miami-based law firm that claims 38 offices and 2,000 attorneys .\nOver three election cycles \u2014 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 \u2014 Thornton partners contributed more than $ 3.4 million to candidates and the party nationwide , especially Democratic Senate candidates who opposed overhauling the asbestos litigation system .\nJust one Republican senator has collected contributions from Thornton \u2019 s lawyers . Lindsey Graham , an idiosyncratic South Carolinian and former trial lawyer , received $ 62,800 over the last decade . Graham helped peel away enough GOP support in the Senate to ensure the trust fund bill \u2019 s death on Valentine \u2019 s Day 2006 , according to former Senate aides .\nThornton \u2019 s lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden , one of Washington \u2019 s strongest advocates for trial lawyers , contributing more than $ 78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008 .\nDuring President Obama and Biden \u2019 s reelection campaign in 2012 , Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge , where Biden was the guest of honor . Some of the biggest donors \u2014 some Thornton partners gave $ 20,000 \u2014 were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden , said someone who was there . Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations .\nThornton declined to speak to the Globe , but he has been vocal about his support for Biden , who , as a senator , once chaired the Judiciary Committee , and twice helped block legislation that would have established the asbestos trust fund .\n\u201c Senator Biden has been a trial-lawyer advocate for many terms in the Senate , \u201d Thornton was quoted as saying in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2008 . \u201c We represent victims ; we think it \u2019 s in the best interest of our clients if they have an opportunity to go to court . Senator Biden agrees . \u201d\nOnce Michael Thornton \u2019 s willingness to raise large amounts of money became known among lawyers and politicians , the American Association for Justice , the trial lawyers \u2019 Washington-based lobbying group , increasingly turned to the firm \u2019 s lawyers for help , even for little-known candidates running in states far from Boston .\n\u201c At first it happened every three or four months , and then it was sometimes three or four times each month , \u201d even though the threat of asbestos litigation reform had faded , said the former employee who requested anonymity .\nAs the number of fund-raisers started piling up , partners began to grouse . Even though Thornton called the contributions \u201c voluntary , \u201d partners felt pressured to give , according to the former employee . After all , Michael Thornton was the firm \u2019 s lead partner , with enormous sway over what the other partners were paid .\nSo , according to three former employees , Thornton Law Firm adopted the donation reimbursement system .\nBonus checks that were reviewed by the Globe made clear that the payments were for political donations , with notations giving the name of the politician the partner had donated to .\nThe Globe and the Center for Responsive Politics reviewed records covering payments to three senior partners \u2014 Thornton , Bradley , and Strouss \u2014 who are among the top shareholders in the firm . Then the Globe and the center matched the bonuses against federal , state , and local campaign records .\nCampaign contribution and law firm records from 2010 through 2014 show that Thornton donated the most , and the firm gave him bonuses that matched not only his donations , but at least 33 made by his wife , Amy , who runs an investment fund . The couple donated just over $ 1 million between 2010 and 2014 , and Thornton received $ 862,450 in offsetting bonuses .\nMichael Thornton , through a spokesman , denied the law firm reimbursed his wife \u2019 s donations .\nBradley made donations of $ 340,535 and received almost as much in bonuses \u2014 $ 339,000 over that period , the records shows .\nStrouss gave $ 205,150 over the five years and received almost the same amount in bonuses \u2014 $ 197,150 .\nBy donating as individuals , lawyers for the firm were able to collectively give far more to individual candidates in a single year than the firm could have donated directly under federal law .\nOver a 10-day period in 2013 , for example , Thornton partners gave $ 52,000 to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , a subcommittee chairman on the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 20 times as much as the $ 2,600 that the partnership itself could have donated . ( Corporate contributions are illegal under federal law , but partnership contributions are not . )\nIn 2012 , the lawyers gave Warren $ 42,200 , 16 times as much as the firm could have given her directly .\nThornton partners gave $ 52,000 to US Senator Chuck Schumer ( left ) , Democrat of New York , over a 10-day period in 2013 \u2014 20 times as much as the $ 2,600 that the partnership itself could have donated . Gary Cameron/Reuters/File 2016\nThornton lawyers also donated more than $ 260,000 to state and local politicians in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2014 .\nIf those donations were determined to have actually been made by the firm \u2014 because the lawyers were reimbursed \u2014 they would be illegal , since political contributions from corporations or partnerships are prohibited in Massachusetts .\nThere \u2019 s no indication that any of the politicians who received Thornton donations knew anything about the law firm \u2019 s questionable reimbursement system .\nThe FEC does allow partners in a law firm to donate to political campaigns , but only if the funds clearly come from the partner \u2019 s own money . According to FEC rules , a partnership can contribute on behalf of its partners , but then must promptly deduct the amount of the donation from the next profit-sharing payments to the partners , called \u201c partnership distributions . \u201d\nBrian Kelly , Thornton \u2019 s outside counsel , said the firm \u2019 s practice is legal because , at the end of each quarter , the firm \u2019 s accountant deducts the political donations from something called the \u201c capital account \u201d of each partner with the firm .\nThe capital account is a way for the accountant to keep track of the partners \u2019 share of equity in the firm . The deductions from the capital account are on paper only , Kelly acknowledged . When partners leave the firm , they may be entitled to a payment from the capital account that Kelly says is reduced by the amount of reimbursements received .\nBut reimbursing partners out of their equity in the firm \u2014 as Kelly said Thornton did \u2014 is likely illegal , said Brett Kappel , a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance .\n\u201c If they were legitimate contributions , they should have been deducted from their partnership distributions , \u201d Kappel said .\nBradley , the senior partner , abruptly resigned his position as assistant majority leader in the state House of Representatives on June 27 after the Globe had begun asking questions about his firm \u2019 s business practices .\nHis decision stunned colleagues , coming so late in the election cycle that there was no time to take his name off the November ballot .\nBradley explained at the time that Michael Thornton was retiring and that he , Bradley , was being promoted to managing partner of his law firm . As a result , he wanted to focus on his legal work . Thornton is now chairman of the firm .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t have the time to do this [ legislative ] job the way it should be done \u201d because of the promotion , Bradley explained to the State House News Service . \u201c It \u2019 s bittersweet for me . \u201d\nSome campaign finance experts say they expect Thornton \u2019 s reimbursement system is likely to raise suspicions among regulators and law enforcement officials alike .\n\u201c The use of the word \u2018 bonus \u2019 for these payments , combined with the fact that they so closely matched the amounts and timing of the donations , would certainly capture the attention of the general counsel \u2019 s office at the FEC\u2014 and given how much was involved , the public integrity section at the Department of Justice , \u201d said Kappel , the Washington campaign finance lawyer .\nThe Globe and the center could not find another law firm that used a similar reimbursement system . Thornton itself stopped the reimbursements when the Globe and the center began asking about it .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been a partner at two law firms and have made many political donations , \u201d said Leonard Kesten , a partner at Brody , Hardoon , Perkins and Kesten in Boston . \u201c But I \u2019 ve never seen anything like this . It seems very peculiar . \u201d\nMeanwhile , in the Senate , measures to change the asbestos litigation system continue to pop up .\nThis year , the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act passed the House , but ran into opposition from Schumer , the New York senator who was a top recipient of Thornton donations .",

Thornton is now chairman of the firm.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the time to do this [legislative] job the way it should be done\u201d because of the promotion, Bradley explained to the State House News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet for me.\u201d\n\nSome campaign finance experts say they expect Thornton\u2019s reimbursement system is likely to raise suspicions among regulators and law enforcement officials alike.\n\n\u201cThe use of the word \u2018bonus\u2019 for these payments, combined with the fact that they so closely matched the amounts and timing of the donations, would certainly capture the attention of the general counsel\u2019s office at the FEC\u2014 and given how much was involved, the public integrity section at the Department of Justice,\u201d said Kappel, the Washington campaign finance lawyer.\n\nThe Globe and the center could not find another law firm that used a similar reimbursement system. Thornton itself stopped the reimbursements when the Globe and the center began asking about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a partner at two law firms and have made many political donations,\u201d said Leonard Kesten, a partner at Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten in Boston. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. It seems very peculiar.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the Senate, measures to change the asbestos litigation system continue to pop up.\n\nThis year, the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act passed the House, but ran into opposition from Schumer, the New York senator who was a top recipient of Thornton donations.\n\nIt died in committee.\n\nDoug Weber and Alex Baumgart of the Center for Responsive Politics contributed to this report.
