Back in October , on 60 Minutes , he said she had not jeopardized national security with her private email server . Since then , we \u2019 ve found out that 2,000 of her emails were classified and 22 were top secret . So could he say flatly that she didn \u2019 t give away America \u2019 s secrets ? \u201d\nWallace continued : \u201c In addition , we talked about the FBI investigation . Can he assure the American public , and does he direct his people , that any decision on the Clinton emails be a legal decision , not a political decision ? And he makes some news there . \u201d\nThe Fox News Channel will re-run Sunday \u2019 s program three times , at 2 p.m. , 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. , after its initial airing on the Fox Television Network\u2014presumably a ratings windfall courtesy of a president who hasn \u2019 t been inclined to do Fox any favors .\n\u201c I think , generally speaking , they don \u2019 t think they get a fair shake from Fox News , \u201d Wallace said about the Obama White House .\n\u201c I think Fox News is more critical of this President than most other news organizations , \u201d Wallace answered in an email to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The White House sometimes doesn \u2019 t like that . But I think we are doing our job\u2014telling all sides of the story . I also think the White House doesn \u2019 t distinguish between our hard news operation and the opinion shows . \u201d\nSo what made the White House , at long last , relent ?\n\u201c He has nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , and they \u2019 re very frustrated with the fact that the Republican Senate refuses to even hold confirmation hearings , let alone to give him an up or down vote , \u201d Wallace said in a phone interview , adding that he \u201c pushed particularly hard \u201d in his pitch to the White House that his program was well-positioned to serve their interests . \u201c They saw Fox News Sunday as an opportunity to reach out to Republicans or Independents or conservative Democrats to try to put pressure on Republican senators to give a full vetting , a normal vetting , to Judge Garland . \u201d\nObama told Wallace that even if Clinton is elected in seven months , and the Senate goes into a lame-duck session , he plans to stick by Garland as his preferred nominee instead of pulling the nomination to let Clinton fill the seat vacated by the death last month of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia .\nWallace , meanwhile , declined to wade into the intrigue surrounding Fox News star and frequent Donald Trump target Megyn Kelly , who has been critical of her colleague Bill O \u2019 Reilly for not defending her more robustly , and recently confided to Variety that while she \u2019 s grateful for Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes \u2019 s staunch support , she must \u201c keep [ her ] options open \u201d on whether to re-up with Fox when her next contract talks come up after the November election .\n\u201c Let me just say I \u2019 ve been too busy interviewing the president of the United States to worry about any of that stuff , \u201d Wallace demurred .\nWhat about before he started preparing for his presidential interview ?\n\u201c I was too busy interviewing Donald Trump last week to worry about that stuff . \u201d\nIn any case , the Washington-based Wallace , who joined Fox News 13 years ago after working at NBC and ABC , feels he \u2019 s insulated from the ongoing melodrama in New York .\n\u201c I do my job , \u201d he said . \u201c My feeling is , cover the campaign , talk to the candidates . Do your job . \u201d\nThe announcement of Wallace \u2019 s presidential \u201c get \u201d this week was sufficiently newsworthy\u2014the media-centric equivalent of \u201c man bites dog \u201d \u2014that White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked in his daily briefing to explain why this liberal-leaning , Democratic president would subject himself to a grilling on an outlet widely perceived as Republican- and conservative-friendly .\n\u201c I think any time that the president is doing an interview with a television program that he hasn \u2019 t done an interview with for a while \u201d \u2014in this case , not since Obama \u2019 s sole Fox News Sunday appearance in 2008 , when he was a mere candidate for president\u2014 \u201c it \u2019 s an opportunity to reach a new audience , or at least an audience that may not have heard from the president directly in a while . \u201d\nCertainly , while they personally exempt Wallace , a registered Democrat , Obama and his aides haven \u2019 t been shy about expressing their disdain for the top-rated cable channel founded by former Republican strategist Ailes at the behest of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 , around the same time that Obama was launching his political career back in Chicago .\nObama has frequently made Fox News the butt of his comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner , and in April 2011 , at the height of Trump \u2019 s birther antics , showed the audience what he termed \u201c my official birth video , \u201d which turned out to be the nativity scene from the Disney animation The Lion King .\n\u201c I want to make clear to the Fox News table , that was a joke , \u201d Obama deadpanned . \u201c That was not my real birth video . That was a children \u2019 s cartoon . Call Disney if you don \u2019 t believe me . They have the original long-form version . \u201d\nAnd in February 2009\u2014in one of two interviews Wallace has conducted with the president outside the purview of his Sunday show\u2014Obama acknowledged that he told a meeting of House Republicans : \u201c Go ahead . Feel free to whack me . I \u2019 ll watch Fox News and feel bad about myself . \u201d\n\u201c Let me just raise the possibility\u2014are you a trifle thin-skinned ? \u201d Wallace asked .\n\u201c No , no , no , \u201d Obama replied with a grin . \u201c I said it in good humor . I think everybody understood that it was a joke . \u201d\nWallace , who later that year referred to Obama and his minions as \u201c the biggest bunch of crybabies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington , \u201d didn \u2019 t get another shot at interviewing the president ( again , not on Fox News Sunday ) until September 2013 , when they discussed the carnage in Syria .\nOn Thursday , he grilled Obama for the better part of half an hour after the president gave a talk at the University of Chicago Law School , where in a previous life he taught constitutional law for a decade while serving for some of that time as an Illinois state senator .\n\u201c I asked him about all the anger among Americans , both Democrats and Republicans , whether it \u2019 s Bernie Sanders supporters or Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters\u2014people who feel dealt out of the game in Washington and on Wall Street\u2014and does he take any responsibility for the fact that after eight years , people still feel the game is rigged . \u201d\nWallace said he also asked the president why he appeared to be so disengaged and emotionally contained when reacting to acts of terrorism that made many Americans angry\u2014cheerfully golfing in Martha Vineyard after commenting on the beheading by ISIS of journalist James Foley , and enjoying a baseball game in Cuba after the horrific attacks in Brussels .\n\u201c We also had a very interesting conversation when we did a walk-and-talk , where I asked him what is best day and worst day at the White House was , \u201d Wallace said . \u201c We were in the law library where he wrote the book Dreams from My Father\u2026There couldn \u2019 t be a sharper contrast with the Oval Office . \u201d",
