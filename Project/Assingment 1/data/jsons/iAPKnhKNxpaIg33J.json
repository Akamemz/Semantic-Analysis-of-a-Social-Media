    "content": "Critics are slamming The New York Times , saying the newspaper has a \u201c hypocritical double standard \u201d after the publication stood by its hiring of tech writer Sarah Jeong despite several derogatory tweets of hers aimed at white people .\nJeong tweeted that she gets joy out of being \u201c cruel to old white men , \u201d used a \u201c CancelWhitePeople \u201d hashtag and sent numerous other offensive tweets . The tweets \u2013 mostly from 2014 \u2013 were unearthed earlier this week after the Times announced Jeong was joining the paper . The paper defended Jeong in a statement on Thursday , chalking her offensive comments up to a \u201c young Asian woman \u201d \u201c imitating the rhetoric \u201d of her own online harassers .\nConservative columnist Daniella Greenbaum told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c the issue at hand here is not about whether Jeong \u2019 s tweets were racist or not. \u201d Greenbaum says that hypocrisy is the real issue .\n\u201c Jeong claimed she was kidding . Good enough , I guess , although swap the word \u2018 white \u2019 and insert black , Mexican , or Jewish in any of her tweets and I have a feeling we \u2019 d be having a very different conversation , \u201d Greenbaum said .\nMuch like Jeong , Greenbaum is a young columnist who has garnered a lot of attention . But Greenbaum is a staunch conservative , who last month resigned from her job as a columnist at Business Insider after the website removed an already-published piece defending Scarlett Johansson for signing on to play a transgender man . The piece apparently offended some of her liberal colleagues and Greenbaum walked away from her job after being censored . Johansson later backed away from the role .\nGreenbaum , who didn \u2019 t exactly receive overwhelming support during her own ordeal , noticed that many in the media industry have rushed to defend Jeong .\n\u201c The New York Times , and much of the media chose to believe that she was kidding , or to posit that even if she wasn \u2019 t kidding , her misguided beliefs are not reason enough to fire her . In other words , they extended her a brand of courtesy never offered to people who are right of center , \u201d Greenbaum said . \u201c That \u2019 s the issue here . \u201d\nHigh-powered liberal media members such as HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen and leadership at The Verge , where Jeong currently works , have defended her rhetoric .\nThe former Business Insider columnist said we have \u201c created an enormous , hypocritical double standard that is entirely unjust \u201d when it comes to judgment in the media industry .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s see how Jeong reacts next time a conservative finds themselves in a similar situation . Something tells me she won \u2019 t speak out on their behalf , \u201d Greenbaum said .\nMedia Research Center analyst Kristine Marsh wrote , \u201c The New York Times justified her racist tweets , \u201d and called the paper \u2019 s statement laughable .\nSome social media users agreed and blasted the paper 's decision on Twitter .\nThe New York Times doubled-down on Jeong \u2019 s behalf in their statement announcing support for the tech writer .\nThe newspaper stated : \u201c We hired Sarah Jeong because of the exceptional work she has done \u2026 her journalism and the fact that she is a young Asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment .
