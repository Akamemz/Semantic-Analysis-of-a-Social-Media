'' But his foundational political promise to eliminate the US trade deficit suffered a blow with new figures showing that the gap between imports and the amount of goods and services that the US sells abroad has grown $ 100 billion since Trump took office , despite two years of his `` America First '' tariff policies intended to reinvigorate American manufacturing .\nSigns that North Korea could be preparing a missile or satellite launch and its continued expansion of an atomic arsenal undercut the President 's claims that his daring outreach to the isolated state has ended its nuclear threat .\nAnd a rise in crossings across the southern border \u2014 while playing into Trump 's claims of a crisis in the short term , contradict his wider argument that hardline enforcement policies are the best way to manage immigration and suggest his totemic political plan for a border wall may be ignoring the real problem .\nTrump appears sensitive to the weak points of his political pitch , and spent the weekend tweeting out glowing testimonials about the economy from allies and accusing journalists of distorting the successes of his presidency .\n`` Despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of American politics , the Trump Administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other Administration .

Liz Cheney , the chair of the House Republican conference , on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on Sunday .\n`` They 've become the party of anti-Semitism , the party of infanticide , the party of socialism .
