    "content": "Wayne Bisher , a lifelong Democrat , says he looks forward to voting for a Democrat for president again someday .\nBut when the 68-year-old heard Donald Trump \u2019 s message on the campaign trail last year , promising to protect American manufacturing and control immigration , there was no doubt whom he would vote for .\nFive months of Trump : Muslims \u2019 fears were high but neighbors stood by them Read more\nHe took early retirement from his job at a pharmaceuticals plant 14 years ago , when cheap Chinese vitamin C flooded the American market , so Trump \u2019 s populist \u201c America First \u201d message resonated strongly with him .\n\u201c I voted for Trump because Hillary Clinton was so deceptive , \u201d Bisher said . \u201c What I told women : did they really want Hillary Clinton to be the first female president of the United States ? That wasn \u2019 t a good idea . I would \u2019 ve voted for other women for president , but not Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nSix months after Trump \u2019 s inauguration , with a daily war raging over the president \u2019 s own alleged deceptions and major campaign promises going unfulfilled , a perceptible shift in mood has set in among Trump voters interviewed for an ongoing Guardian series in Northampton County , Pennsylvania .\nThe thrill of victory , for many Trump backers , has been replaced by something closer to disgust \u2013 the kind of disgust that makes people turn off the news .\nThey still back the president . But they express sharp resentment of the president \u2019 s perceived enemies in the media and official Washington , and describe fatigue from defending a political figure who does not always make it easy . In a striking number of interviews , the conversation eventually turns to the candidate Trump beat eight months ago \u2013 Clinton \u2013 whose alleged trespasses are brandished to answer questions about Trump \u2019 s alleged trespasses .\nTo the extent that Trump may be corrupt , his supporters say , Clinton would have been worse \u2013 so much worse , to the thinking of some Trump voters , that even if Trump had cheated to win the election , it was worth it .\nFor now , any Trump voters who might be nursing doubts about the president are mostly not advertising that sentiment to the media . \u201c They don \u2019 t want to admit that they may be wrong , \u201d explained Cathy Robinson , 70 .\nRobinson was attending a hot-rod show in East Bangor on Saturday night with her husband , John . While she referred to Trump supporters as \u201c they \u201d , Robinson , a registered Democrat , said she had \u201c not necessarily \u201d voted for Clinton for president \u2013 although she had indeed voted .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a hard thing for us as humans to admit that somebody took us over the barrel and we went in there with all the good intentions of changing things , because that \u2019 s what this person promised he was going to do , \u201d Robinson said . \u201c And now we look at it six months later , and we \u2019 re no better off six months later than we were when Obama was in office .\n\u201c People do not want to admit that somebody actually fooled them that well . \u201d\nAlmost every one of the Trump voters approached by \u2588\u2588\u2588 said they approved of the president \u2019 s performance to this point . Allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , for example , do not concern them much \u2013 meaning , among other things , that the nonstop focus on the issue by the media strikes Trump voters as both annoying and corrupt .\n\u201c About two weeks ago , I stopped watching the news , \u201d said Bisher . \u201c Because it was just like , it was too depressing . They \u2019 re still bitching about the Russia thing , which is still not going to amount to anything .\n\u201c I feel so much better , for the last two weeks . \u201d\nBisher was atypical , for allowing that Trump was a \u201c a bit of a nut \u201d and saying of a potential Trump 2020 presidential bid : \u201c Based on what he does this first term , I \u2019 d say well , if he really is screwing everything up , I wouldn \u2019 t want him back . \u201d\nMany Trump supporters give the president far more latitude than Bisher , with some saying that even if Trump had cheated in the election with Russia , the result was still preferable to a Clinton presidency .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what all was done , \u201d said Jack Artley , 43 , a machine operator at the Biospectra pharmaceuticals plant in Bangor . \u201c No matter how it comes out , even if it comes out that there was some shady business going on there , I \u2019 d rather Trump in there than Clinton . So , whether he had to cheat or not to get in , I \u2019 m OK with that . \u201d\n\u201c If they did , I \u2019 m actually glad they did , \u201d John Picard , a carpenter , said of alleged Russian tampering in the election . \u201c I feel that you shouldn \u2019 t bother somebody else \u2019 s country . But the idea that they got all this information and they let it slip out \u2013 I \u2019 m happy if that \u2019 s true . We got some real good documents on some people who were really messed up , so why not ? \u201d\nEven as they remain steadfast in their support for the president , many Trump voters have begun to express a disaffection that extends blob-like in every direction . The political establishment is trying to destroy Trump , they say , by flogging what they see as a dubious Russia collusion story , while denying the problem of Democrats they believe have been involved in alleged homegrown election fraud .\nCongress and the justice department are wasting millions of dollars on a politically motivated witch hunt to destroy the president , they feel , after the same establishment gave a pass to the alleged crimes of Clinton and Obama .\nThe media has dropped all pretense of even-handedness to devote itself full time to the president \u2019 s destruction , they think , driven by a revenge lust for the defeat of Clinton , their preferred candidate .\n\u201c They can play all these games all they like , but the Trump supporters are not going to ever turn around and say we \u2019 re concerned about something that has been part of the political process for decades , \u201d Tom Carroll , a conservative grassroots activist from Bethlehem said of Trump Jr \u2019 s meeting with Russians to get dirt on Clinton . ( Political activists in both parties have called the meeting extraordinary and possibly unique . )\nWe got fake news , like Trump said , and I \u2019 m upset with the news . I won \u2019 t even turn on the television any more Bruce Garis\nCarroll , a criminal defense lawyer and a vice-chairman of the local Tea Party , spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a late afternoon interview on his back deck .\n\u201c You really talk to people and \u2013 you know what drove a lot of people ? \u201d Carroll said . \u201c Believe it or not , they won \u2019 t leave Trump for anything . But it \u2019 s not because they love Trump , it \u2019 s because they love their families , they love their country , and they were fearful of what was gon na happen if Hillary Clinton got elected president . \u201d\nIt is remarkable how Clinton , who has largely stepped away from the national stage after her November loss , still looms in the minds of many Trump voters . A conversation inside the Trolley Shop restaurant in Bangor about whether US intelligence agencies can be trusted \u2013 not really , was the general consensus \u2013 suddenly turned to Clinton .\n\u201c Hillary Clinton hurt herself , \u201d said Mickie Jones , who owns the oldest business in Bangor \u2013 a tombstone business \u2013 with her husband , Keith . \u201c She hurt her party , between lies and things that she did . They haven \u2019 t accepted that . I think she \u2019 s a liar . And these people don \u2019 t see that . \u201d\nKeith Jones , an air force veteran who was stationed in Korea right after the war , said the relationship between Clinton and the media went a long way to explaining the perceived media bias against Trump .\n\u201c The press has an agenda , and it isn \u2019 t the same agenda as his , \u201d Jones said . \u201c Hillary was their darling , Obama was their darling . And you kick them in the shins there , and they get a little ornery . They \u2019 re ornery , and they \u2019 re trying to run Trump into the ground . \u201d\nBruce Garis , 75 , is a retired heavy equipment operator from Bangor and was a lifelong Democrat , he said , until he voted for Trump .\n\u201c I switched from Democrat to Republican , because the Democratic party went so far left that they are no more for the working man , \u201d he said . \u201c And I feel as if we need somebody in there for the lower-class man .\n\u201c For all the harassment that \u2019 s going on , I believe that he \u2019 s doing what he can do . There \u2019 s a lot of hindrance there , that shouldn \u2019 t be . But I \u2019 m very upset . This is not the America I grew up in . And I \u2019 d just like things to get better .\n\u201c We got fake news , like Trump said , and I \u2019 m upset with the news . I won \u2019 t even turn on the television any more . \u201d\nJuly in Northampton County is sunny and leafy , prime time for the pleasures of summer . The highway is a daisy chain of farm stands , yard sales and fire department fund-drives . Thousands of people turn out for an antique tractor show , where gawkers can nose up to 100-year-old flywheels moving at amputation speeds . Hot-rod enthusiasts gather for a car show where locals dance to a three-piece band playing Ernest Tubb and Jim Reeves tunes . After a certain hour , every county resident under 15 is addled on ice cream .\nChristopher Borick , a professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College institute of public opinion in Allentown , strolled to the town square in Nazareth , where he lives , to meet with \u2588\u2588\u2588 under an immense maple tree .\n\u201c I think on the whole , most Trump supporters are still Trump supporters , \u201d Borick said . \u201c Many of them continue to say that Trump \u2019 s problems , if they exist , are manufactured by the media and Democrats who are being obstructionist . So most of the Trump support that we saw last fall in Northampton County still exists , largely as it was .\n\u201c But if you pull a little bit away under the covers , you see some signs of fraying . And the signs that I see are among those Trump supporters who did so grudgingly last fall . They have some sunken cost in Donald Trump . They supported him . They may have even taken some heat for supporting him from non-Trump supporters in the area . And as they try to hold on to their reasoning and their support and make their case , I think they feel a little weariness , a little tired in their explanation . \u201d\nMany Trump supporters said that they would abandon their support for the president if undeniable evidence of criminal activity in the Russia matter surfaced \u2013 the \u201c undeniable \u201d bit , of course , being extremely subjective .\nAs we come to midterm elections , if people are feeling very negative about healthcare as they are now , that can resonate Christopher Borick\nAn issue where Trump seems to be much more vulnerable is healthcare . And unlike on other issues , where chatting with Trump supporters can feel like scrolling through the president \u2019 s Twitter feed \u2013 \u201c fake news \u201d , \u201c witch hunt \u201d , \u201c illegal leaks \u201d , \u201c voter fraud \u201d , \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d \u2013 Trump voters in Northampton County talk about healthcare with notable measures of nuance , restraint , and human sympathy .\n\u201c This health issue is a major problem , \u201d said Mickie Jones . \u201c I really think they should be settling on that issue . Because there are so many elderly people around the country , and here we are , fighting each other .\n\u201c They have to do something . They have to . They just have to . And it seems like they \u2019 re stalling on it . \u201d\nProspero T Zito , 74 , is another Northampton Democrat who voted for Trump . \u201c He needs a little more time to get his priorities together , \u201d Zito said of the president .\nHe believes in the need for health reform , but is worried about the impact on the sick and the poor . \u201c I think this healthcare is just a little bit out of hand right now . But the people who really need it , that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m looking out for . I think they \u2019 ll straighten it out . Both parties , they \u2019 ll have to come together . \u201d\nJohn Griffin , a retired elevator technician and a Republican who voted for Trump , said he was not holding his breath for a bipartisan solution . \u201c Not gon na happen . It \u2019 ll never happen , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They \u2019 ll never get together and do it . But if they can get together and do something for the people \u2013 not for themselves , but for the people \u2013 I \u2019 ll go along with it . \u201d\nBorick , the political scientist , said the healthcare issue could damage Republicans or the president in upcoming elections .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve polled this issue really heavily for six years , \u201d said Borick . \u201c Like many places , Obamacare has reached its zenith in popularity in the commonwealth [ of Pennsylvania ] . It \u2019 s never been more popular , and the congressional proposals were very unpopular .\n\u201c That remains a vexing issue for Republicans . And a vexing issue for the president . Talk about issues that could be incredibly damaging , there \u2019 s a point where people will see in the next two years what kind of effect those changes or lack of changes have .\n\u201c On the whole it holds enormous peril , much more peril than promise for both the Republicans and the president . As we come to that midterm election , if people are feeling very negative about that issue as they are now , that can resonate .\nLittle Creek Bar B Cue ( \u201c You can \u2019 t beat our meat ! \u201d ) in Washington Township is in its ninth year . The restaurant has cooked competitively in 14 different states and twice placed first for barbecue ribs in contests with over 100 teams . Pulled pork is their number one seller .\n\u201c We \u2019 re selling a lot of brisket lately . I \u2019 ve learned how to cook brisket pretty decent , almost as good as those guys down in Texas , \u201d said Rich Green , 50 , who owns the place with his wife , Kim . \u201c I \u2019 ll put my brisket against them Texas people any day of the week . \u201d\nGreen is a professional ironworker as well as a chef , and a gun enthusiast who said he expanded his inventory aggressively when he thought Clinton was going to win the election .\nTrump diehards dismiss Russia scandal : 'Show me the proof \u2013 or get off his case ' Read more\nHe took a break from cooking last weekend to muse on how , exactly , the Russians were supposed to have tricked him into voting for Trump .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how it would be possible . Nobody called me , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve never voted before , this was the first time I voted \u2013 nobody called me and said who to vote for . \u201d\nApart from their distrust of the media and the Washington establishment , one good reason Trump voters might not believe the Russia collusion story is because they all know someone who voted for Trump without any tampering by Russia , they think : the person in the mirror .\nDespite his strong support for Trump , Green said he would vote for a Democrat in the future , \u201c if it was the right person , and they were doing the right thing \u201d .\n\u201c I would go more towards the person , than the party , myself . I \u2019 m more about , let \u2019 s do the right thing here , \u201d Green said . \u201c It is kind of stupid to be diehard Democrat or Republican . \u201d\nKim Green , 52 , agreed that Trump the man \u2013 his personal sympathies and his policy priorities \u2013 was more important than Trump the Republican .\n\u201c Because he \u2019 s for the common man , \u201d she said . \u201c And I don \u2019 t care what anybody says about how much money he has and everything else . He \u2019 s just like everybody else , he \u2019 s for us . \u201d\n\u201c Or it \u2019 s the biggest scam America \u2019 s ever fell for , \u201d Rich Green interjected . \u201c One of the two . \u201d",

And it seems like they\u2019re stalling on it.\u201d\n\nProspero T Zito, 74, is another Northampton Democrat who voted for Trump. \u201cHe needs a little more time to get his priorities together,\u201d Zito said of the president.\n\nHe believes in the need for health reform, but is worried about the impact on the sick and the poor. \u201cI think this healthcare is just a little bit out of hand right now. But the people who really need it, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking out for. I think they\u2019ll straighten it out. Both parties, they\u2019ll have to come together.\u201d\n\nJohn Griffin, a retired elevator technician and a Republican who voted for Trump, said he was not holding his breath for a bipartisan solution. \u201cNot gonna happen. It\u2019ll never happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never get together and do it. But if they can get together and do something for the people \u2013 not for themselves, but for the people \u2013 I\u2019ll go along with it.\u201d\n\nBorick, the political scientist, said the healthcare issue could damage Republicans or the president in upcoming elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve polled this issue really heavily for six years,\u201d said Borick. \u201cLike many places, Obamacare has reached its zenith in popularity in the commonwealth [of Pennsylvania]. It\u2019s never been more popular, and the congressional proposals were very unpopular.\n\n\u201cThat remains a vexing issue for Republicans. And a vexing issue for the president. Talk about issues that could be incredibly damaging, there\u2019s a point where people will see in the next two years what kind of effect those changes or lack of changes have.\n\n\u201cOn the whole it holds enormous peril, much more peril than promise for both the Republicans and the president. As we come to that midterm election, if people are feeling very negative about that issue as they are now, that can resonate.\n\n\u201cThat can have substantial effect.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Green.

The restaurant has cooked competitively in 14 different states and twice placed first for barbecue ribs in contests with over 100 teams. Pulled pork is their number one seller.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re selling a lot of brisket lately. I\u2019ve learned how to cook brisket pretty decent, almost as good as those guys down in Texas,\u201d said Rich Green, 50, who owns the place with his wife, Kim. \u201cI\u2019ll put my brisket against them Texas people any day of the week.\u201d\n\nGreen is a professional ironworker as well as a chef, and a gun enthusiast who said he expanded his inventory aggressively when he thought Clinton was going to win the election.\n\nTrump diehards dismiss Russia scandal: 'Show me the proof \u2013 or get off his case' Read more\n\nHe took a break from cooking last weekend to muse on how, exactly, the Russians were supposed to have tricked him into voting for Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it would be possible. Nobody called me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never voted before, this was the first time I voted \u2013 nobody called me and said who to vote for.\u201d\n\nApart from their distrust of the media and the Washington establishment, one good reason Trump voters might not believe the Russia collusion story is because they all know someone who voted for Trump without any tampering by Russia, they think: the person in the mirror.\n\nDespite his strong support for Trump, Green said he would vote for a Democrat in the future, \u201cif it was the right person, and they were doing the right thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would go more towards the person, than the party, myself. I\u2019m more about, let\u2019s do the right thing here,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt is kind of stupid to be diehard Democrat or Republican.\u201d\n\nKim Green, 52, agreed that Trump the man \u2013 his personal sympathies and his policy priorities \u2013 was more important than Trump the Republican.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s for the common man,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what anybody says about how much money he has and everything else. He\u2019s just like everybody else, he\u2019s for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr it\u2019s the biggest scam America\u2019s ever fell for,\u201d Rich Green interjected. \u201cOne of the two.\u201d\n\nSign up for regular email dispatches throughout the year to hear from Tom and the people of Northampton County",
