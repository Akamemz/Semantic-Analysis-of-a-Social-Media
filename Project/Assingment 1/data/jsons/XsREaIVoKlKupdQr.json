( Reuters/Jim Bourg )\nYou have opponents whose first and only objective is delay . From the start of the confirmation proceedings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination to the Supreme Court , those opponents , Senate Democrats , have thus pushed for delay . At every turn . Of course they never come out and say that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re doing \u2014 they never come out and say , \u201c We \u2019 ve abused the confirmation process and dropped a bomb at the eleventh hour , an uncorroborated , 36-year-old allegation of sexual assault , because we \u2019 re trying to delay the vote until after the midterms. \u201d But delay is what they want .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter what sheep \u2019 s clothing the wolf comes in ; the wolf is always delay . When they say , \u201c We \u2019 re protecting survivors , \u201d they mean , \u201c We want delay. \u201d When they posture that \u201c women must be believed , \u201d their aim is more delay . When they say , \u201c The FBI must investigate to remove any cloud over the nominee , \u201d the translation is : \u201c Give us a delay so we can come up with new reasons for delay . \u201d\nSo , finally , we get to a committee vote over two weeks after it should have happened ; after reopening a hearing that involved 31 hours of testimony from the nominee ; after 65 meetings with senators and followed by over 1,200 answers to post-hearing questions , more than the combined number of post-hearing questions in the history of Supreme Court nominations . We finally get Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination voted out of committee . And then , as a final floor vote is about to be scheduled and debated , Republicans \u2014 taking their lead from the ineffable Jeff Flake \u2014 agree to accede to one more Democratic request ( really , just one more , cross-our-hearts . . . ) . And what would that be ?\nThe rationale for this delay is priceless : We need an FBI investigation . It is understandable that the public does not realize how specious this demand is . But who would have thought Senate Republicans were in need of a civics lesson ?\nThe Constitution assigns the advice-and-consent function to the legislative branch . The FBI is a component of the executive branch . The constitutional powers of the legislature are not contingent on the cooperation of the executive . Moreover , the FBI did not exist until it was created by statute at the start of the 20th century , meaning the Senate was quite capably vetting judicial nominations for over a century before there was an FBI .\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee , which is charged with assessing judicial nominees , has one of the largest professional staffs of any committee on Capitol Hill . The staff includes many former federal prosecutors and investigators . The committee never needs to wait for the FBI ; it can conduct its own , very thorough investigation of any judicial nominee .\nIn connection with appointments to the judiciary and executive-branch offices , the FBI assists the Senate by conducting background investigations of nominees . These investigations are not like criminal investigations , in which the FBI attempts to build a prosecution by developing proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the essential elements of federal penal offenses . The investigations are not like counterintelligence investigations , in which the FBI gathers intelligence about threats to American interests posed by foreign powers . In a background investigation , the FBI simply checks its indicies ( such as its databank of rap sheets ) and conducts interviews with colleagues , associates , neighbors , and other acquaintances of the nominee . The point is not to conduct criminal investigations of any allegations that develop \u2014 particularly not of state-law violations that may be time-barred for prosecution and that the FBI does not have jurisdiction to investigate anyway . The point is to flag issues for the Senate so that it may make a discriminating appraisal of the nominee \u2019 s professional competence and character .\nIn conducting a background check , the FBI does not draw a conclusion about a nominee \u2019 s suitability . If alleged misconduct is not the subject of a conviction or acquittal , the FBI does not make an assessment of guilt or innocence . To do these things would be to usurp the constitutional role of the Senate \u2014 it is the Senate , not the FBI , that decides whether a nominee is fit for the responsibilities of the office to which he is nominated .\nMoreover , the Senate typically does not abdicate its responsibilities or judgment to executive agencies . If , for example , the FBI were to decide tomorrow that some state police agency had not committed a civil-rights violation for which it was being investigated following some racially charged incident , Democratic senators would revert to their default position of announcing that they would conduct their own investigation because the FBI is highly fallible . On most issues , Dianne Feinstein and Judiciary Committee Democrats do not suggest that the exercise of the Senate \u2019 s constitutional prerogatives must be suspended until Christopher Wray descends from Mount Sinai with the relevant tablets .\nAn FBI investigation of unsubstantiated allegations against Judge Kavanaugh would not resolve those allegations . If the FBI tried to resolve them but came out in Kavanaugh \u2019 s favor , Democrats would say the investigation was flawed \u2014 politicized by the Trump administration . But , in fact , the FBI would not try to resolve them ; the bureau would simply interview some pertinent witnesses \u2014 if they agreed to speak to the FBI , which they would not be required to do . It would then pass the interview summaries along to the Judiciary Committee so that it could decide what probative value , if any , they had on the matter of Kavanaugh \u2019 s suitability . In other words , the FBI would only do exactly what the committee could do by itself \u2014 talk to people who might have germane information . There is nothing magical , dispositive , or conclusive about an FBI background investigation .\nJudiciary Committee Democrats do not want an FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh because they think it will be especially illuminating or reliable . They want it because it will result in delay , giving them the breathing room necessary to come up with more reasons for delay .\nSo , naturally , Republicans are giving them their FBI investigation , and more delay .\nObserving that the GOP majority is giving Democrats exactly what they want does not adequately convey how incompetently Republicans have performed . In announcing that the floor vote on Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination will be delayed , the Senate Judiciary Committee , under Republican control , issued a press release Friday afternoon , which states ( my italics ) : \u201c The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee. \u201d But there are no credible allegations against Kavanaugh ; there are incredible allegations that stand uncorroborated and convincingly denied .\nUnbelievably , Republicans put this statement out right before President Trump agreed to the ( purported ) one-week delay for the investigation . Thus , the media can now accurately report that the president was convinced to direct an additional FBI probe after Senate Republicans expressly conceded that the sexual-assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are credible .\nAnd why are they \u201c credible \u201d ? Because Christine Blasey Ford , Kavanaugh \u2019 s principal accuser , was widely deemed credible in her testimony at Thursday \u2019 s hearing \u2014 even though her story has no support from independent evidence , is rejected by the witnesses she named , and is incoherent because she can not recall and relate rudimentary details .\nHow did such an account get labeled \u201c credible \u201d ? Well , to question Dr. Ford at the hearing , Judiciary Committee Republicans retained Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell . In principle , this was not a bad plan , but somebody forgot to tell Ms. Mitchell that this was a high-stakes hearing in need of searching cross-examination , not the rambling , information-gathering questioning typical of a deposition .\nMaybe Republicans instructed Mitchell to refrain from asking Ford hard questions ; or maybe , her experience notwithstanding , Mitchell took it on herself to conduct a gentle , confrontation-free examination . Either way , in the one and only chance they will ever have to question Ford , Republicans failed to highlight the deep flaws in her account .\nMitchell invited Ford to wax scientific about how \u201c the etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial , \u201d and to school Mitchell on the topography of Montgomery County . But if you were listening for basic questions about the alleged sexual assault , you listened in vain . This isn \u2019 t hard . A lawyer could have been completely respectful of Dr. Ford \u2019 s emotional distress and still have asked elementary questions :\nIsn \u2019 t it a fact that you don \u2019 t know where or when this purported assault happened ?\nIsn \u2019 t it a fact that you can \u2019 t tell us how you got there ?\nYou just know the house was several miles from your home , but it is a fact , is it not , that you can \u2019 t tell us how you got home ?\nYou \u2019 ve told us that you were terrified running out of the house after the attack , but you can \u2019 t tell us who rescued you and drove you away ?\nYou remember 36 years ago that you had exactly one beer at the party , you remember hearing your alleged attackers go downstairs , you remember exactly the route you took to get out of the house , yet you can \u2019 t tell us what happened after you left the house ?\nSo , you \u2019 re sure the party happened , but you can \u2019 t say when it happened , you can \u2019 t say where it happened , you don \u2019 t know how you got there , you don \u2019 t know how you got home , and every person you \u2019 ve identified as a witness says that they have no memory of the party and that they never saw Brett Kavanaugh act the way you \u2019 ve described , isn \u2019 t that right ?\nIt would not have taken very long .
