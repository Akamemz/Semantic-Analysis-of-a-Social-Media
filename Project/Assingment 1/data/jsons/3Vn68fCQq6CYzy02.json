Obama MIA on military sex assault ?\nPresident Barack Obama has no problem forcing changes at the Pentagon .\nIn five years , he \u2019 s drawn down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , repealed \u201c don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell \u201d and given a green light to allow women to fight alongside men in combat .\nBut when it comes to the next big battle at the Defense Department \u2014 over sexual assault in the ranks \u2014 don \u2019 t expect Obama to lead the charge .\nHe hasn \u2019 t formally met with female Democrats who \u2019 ve made the issue a priority in Congress , despite repeated requests from one of them . He hasn \u2019 t endorsed any of their proposals . And his top aides have made no commitment to lawmakers and victims groups beyond pressuring military brass behind the scenes .\nObama could argue he \u2019 s still done more to stamp out sexual assault in the military than any other president , even raising the issue in front of military audiences .\n\u201c No military unit can succeed without discipline , without trust and without cohesion , \u201d Obama told Marines at Camp Pendleton on Wednesday . \u201c And that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re going to work together , all of us , to stop these crimes of sexual assault and uphold the honor and the integrity that defines the finest military on Earth . And that message is coming all the way from the top . \u201d\nBut there \u2019 s little reason to think Obama will go beyond generic calls for change to take a clear stand on what he believes a serious overhaul should look like , even as the Senate debates competing proposals to tackle the very issue .\nMembers of his party aren \u2019 t expecting him to dive in since it would almost certainly cost Obama with military brass who have resisted significant changes for 25 years .\nAnd Obama could even end up angering some Democrats since members of the party are divided on whether to remove prosecution of sexual assault cases from the chain of command or rely on the military hierarchy to enforce new policies .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never counted on the administration . I just think it \u2019 s something we \u2019 re working here , \u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , who is partnering with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) on legislation to remove prosecution of sexual assault cases from the military \u2019 s chain of command .\nRep. Mike Turner ( R-Ohio ) said Obama \u201c has been somewhat late to the game \u201d on the issue , which Turner has been trying to help solve for years . He nudged the White House to support what the House adopted in its version of the defense bill , including provisions that expand legal counsel for victims , establish mandatory minimum sentences for convicted sex offenders and eliminate a commander \u2019 s ability to overturn a jury verdict .\n\u201c But I think people have not seen leadership out of the administration , \u201d Turner said . \u201c He wasn \u2019 t commenting on the issue until legislation had practically passed through the House . \u201d\nSo far , the White House hasn \u2019 t said whether Obama would support the chain of command measure or any of the other proposals senators are still debating .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t comment on legislation at this point in the process , but as we \u2019 ve said , we are open to consideration of any ideas to improve prosecution , prevention and victim support , \u201d said White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden .\nSen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , who supports the command chain legislation , said he had his doubts Obama would step in during the critical moments of rounding up votes . \u201c If he does , he \u2019 ll do it at the last minute , \u201d Grassley said , adding that \u201c legislating is too messy for him . \u201d\nSenate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jim Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , an opponent of the Gillibrand-led approach , teased that if Obama did support the proposal , it could scare off some Republican supporters .\nAnd Obama might not do much to flip Democrats either , according to Sen. Claire McCaskill , the Missouri Democrat who \u2019 s spearheading opposition to the Gillibrand bill . McCaskill supports an alternative package of reforms .\n\u201c There \u2019 s very few Democrats that are undecided at this point . I don \u2019 t know if it would or not , if he weighed in , it would make a difference , \u201d McCaskill said . She added that she \u2019 d \u201c have a hard time imagining \u201d Obama would take a different stance than Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel , who initially expressed doubt about Gillibrand \u2019 s bill .\nBut still , some Democrats are hoping to get Obama on board . Gillibrand is trying to sway undecided senators on her chain of command proposal and has been working the West Wing \u2019 s back channels with phone calls to Valerie Jarrett and lunch with Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall , the White House \u2019 s defense policy coordinator . She is also asking for face time with the president to make her pitch to remove the command chain , the same way she \u2019 s been approaching fence-sitting senators on the floor and in their personal offices .\n\u201c I \u2019 m doing everything in my power to make that happen . I \u2019 m going to marshal the evidence . I \u2019 m going to marshal the advocacy , \u201d the New York Democrat told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nRep. Jackie Speier ( D-Calif. ) , who like Gillibrand is advocating major changes in the military command \u2019 s oversight of prosecutions , said she \u2019 s been making personal pleas to Obama \u201c every time I \u2019 m around him. \u201d That included a brief moment with the president during picture time at the White House holiday party and when she handed him some papers about her legislation at the House Democratic retreat . She said she was also ready to bring the issue up during last week \u2019 s meeting in the Capitol with Obama .\n\u201c I was too far up the line to be able to get my question in , \u201d she said .\nPressure is likewise building on Vice President Joe Biden to further challenge the Pentagon , with longtime allies noting the former Delaware senator \u2019 s own legislative r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994 as well as its reauthorization earlier this year . \u201c I know he hates this kind of violence , \u201d said Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation .\nSenior White House aides including Tina Tchen , the chief of staff to Michelle Obama , and Lynn Rosenthal , the top adviser on violence against women and former executive director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence , have been heading up talks with lawmakers and victims groups . One recent session covered the transition for victims from military to civilian life and their struggles in getting health care .\nTurner said he wasn \u2019 t impressed by a White House meeting in May that brought together 16 lawmakers who have been working on sexual assault matters \u2014 some for several years . \u201c It was almost as if our office was putting out a 101 briefing of what the issues were and what the various pieces of legislation would accomplish , \u201d he said .\nHagel , who has also been leading weekly meetings on sexual assault with senior Pentagon brass , is expected in the coming days to release six new policies on the issue , including an expansion of an advocacy program for victims to all military branches and recurring inspector general audits of all closed investigations , according to an internal memo of the draft plans obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nA senior White House aide also praised Hagel for his move earlier this year requesting legislation that would put a stop to commanders overturning jury verdicts . \u201c We thought that was a really great step and commitment to improving the system , \u201d said the White House official .\nFor his part , Obama warned in May that \u201c there is no silver bullet to solving this problem \u201d while urging Hagel to work on \u201c effective metrics and feedback loops \u201d that will help in understanding how much more needs to be done . The president said he wanted over the next several months and years to see a surge in victim reporting on sexual assault \u201c that may actually indicate to me that people are becoming more confident about moving forward . \u201d\n\u201c On the other hand , I then want those trend lines to start going down because that indicates that we \u2019 re also starting to fix the problem and we \u2019 ve highlighted it , and people who are engaged in despicable behavior , they get fully punished for it , \u201d Obama said .\nWith so much media attention now focused on the issue , Kirby Dick , director of \u201c The Invisible War , \u201d an Oscar-nominated documentary about sexual assault in the military , said the White House meetings have afforded people like him a chance to pressure Obama \u2019 s team to step up now .\n\u201c This is a real moment of opportunity . These moments do pass . Right now , there \u2019 s an outrage , \u201d said Dick , adding that he \u2019 s been to White House meetings in May and June \u201c to share our concerns and to discuss appropriate policy solutions . \u201d\n\u201c Many of these assaults happened while he was commander in chief , \u201d Dick said . \u201c The Pentagon and DoD are all going to be judged on if this problem is really finally addressed . History is going to judge him on this . \u201d\nThe calls for Obama to speak up are coming from other quarters , too . In an op-ed piece picked up online by Fox News , The Daily Caller and The Hill , former Clinton White House lawyer Lanny Davis asked why Obama was missing in action on Gillibrand \u2019 s proposal , which has already notched the support of political opposites like Sens . Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) and Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , a pair of 2016 hopefuls , and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) .\n\u201c After all , this purple moment when Paul and Sanders agree on something doesn \u2019 t happen very often , \u201d Davis wrote . \u201c Obama should be ready to lead and support Gillibrand \u2019 s proposal , especially when the need for a perceived independent process for protecting victims of sexual assault seems so obvious and the downside so unclear . Maybe , just maybe , Obama can make this moment a precedent for more purple moments in Congress in the remainder of his term . \u201d\nFor Obama , speaking out on military sexual assault also creates potential legal questions .\nA Navy judge in Hawaii ruled in June that two defendants on trial for sexual assault couldn \u2019 t be punitively discharged because of the president \u2019 s remarks a month earlier during a White House press conference in which he said : \u201c If we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff , they \u2019 ve got to be held accountable \u2014 prosecuted , stripped of their positions , court-martialed , fired , dishonorably discharged . Period . It \u2019 s not acceptable . \u201d\nAccording to the judge \u2019 s ruling , Obama \u2019 s comments represented \u201c unlawful command influence \u201d by suggesting he had a specific punishment in mind for the perpetrators .\nOther military judges have also cited the president \u2019 s comments in their opinions , and more than a dozen defense attorneys have been pointing to the remarks in their own cases .\n\u201c If they don \u2019 t raise it as an issue , then it could be grounds for incompetence , \u201d said Thomas Romig , dean of the Washburn University School of Law in Topeka , Kan. , and a former Army judge advocate general .\nEugene Fidell , a military justice teacher at Yale Law School , said he would prefer to hear Obama speak up more frequently on sexual assault . But he said White House lawyers would be smart to advise the president to stay within some boundaries : stating his concerns and the need to keep women and men safe from these kinds of crimes .\n\u201c Anything beyond that is simply asking for trouble , \u201d Fidell said .\nAddressing the legal quagmire , Hagel weighed in Tuesday with a signed memo to senior Pentagon officials about the \u201c integrity of the military justice system \u201d that sought to downplay the reach of Obama \u2019 s remarks .\n\u201c To be clear , each military justice case must be resolved on its own facts , \u201d Hagel wrote in the memo obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Those who exercise discretionary authority in the military justice process must exercise their independent judgment , consistent with applicable law and regulation . \u201d\n\u201c The president was not being prescriptive in his comments . Rather , he was listing a range of examples of how offenders could be held accountable . The president expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment . \u201d\nAnother problem for Obama \u2014 and one he \u2019 s got the power to control \u2014 is the image of who \u2019 s calling the shots on the issue . Consider the photos and video from the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2019 s June hearing on sexual assault in the military , where only one of the 12 lead witnesses from the Defense Department was a woman \u2014 the others were all older white males .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no reason why the administration can \u2019 t and shouldn \u2019 t consider appointing women on par with their appointments of men , \u201d said Ana Cruz , a Tampa-based Democratic strategist who worked as Hillary Clinton \u2019 s Florida spokeswoman during the 2008 presidential campaign . She called on Obama to make it a point to hire more women to higher positions within the military , \u201c particularly when it comes to overseeing departments that deal with sexual harassment . \u201d\nSeveral military veterans credited Obama with going as far as he can as the country \u2019 s top civilian leader .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a tough one because I understand the corner he is in as the commander in chief . I don \u2019 t think that should preclude him from supporting policy that he might think is right , \u201d said Tom Tarantino , a former Army captain and policy associate at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .\nEven if he doesn \u2019 t weigh in on Gillibrand \u2019 s bill , Obama \u2019 s efforts to date still represent an advance on the issue , given his main job is to make sure service members can do the jobs he gives them , said Greg Jacob , policy director at the Service Women \u2019 s Action Network .\n\u201c In the past , it seems like the role of commander in chief , it \u2019 s been a lot easier to basically send troops out on missions than it is to deal with the day-to-day issue of their protection , their safety , \u201d he said .\nFormer Vermont Gov . Howard Dean said Obama \u2019 s been \u201c more out front than any president in history \u201d on the issue of sexual assault , noting the addition of more women into higher-profile roles at the Pentagon .\nBut Dean said the president could still do more , including endorsing the Gillibrand bill .\n\u201c The military is a very big institution and it \u2019 s not going to change on its own . It needs some help from the outside , \u201d Dean said . \u201c Unless the president does what Harry Truman did regarding desegregation , it \u2019 s just going to take a very long time . \u201d",

Howard Dean said Obama\u2019s been \u201cmore out front than any president in history\u201d on the issue of sexual assault, noting the addition of more women into higher-profile roles at the Pentagon.\n\nBut Dean said the president could still do more, including endorsing the Gillibrand bill.\n\n\u201cThe military is a very big institution and it\u2019s not going to change on its own. It needs some help from the outside,\u201d Dean said. \u201cUnless the president does what Harry Truman did regarding desegregation, it\u2019s just going to take a very long time.\u201d",
