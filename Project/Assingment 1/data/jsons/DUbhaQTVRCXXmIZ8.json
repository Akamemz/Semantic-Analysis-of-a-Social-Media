For all the ink and pixels spilled , there were n't actually very many of them on the ballot . Forty-six Democratic Socialists of America ( DSA ) candidates won primaries in 2018 . Of those , 14 were backed by the national Democratic Party and only four were running for the U.S. House . Most prominent among them was New York 's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who endorsed a few more candidates on her own as well .\nOcasio-Cortez won her congressional race in a landslide , as did Rashida Tlaib in Michigan . But DSA 's Sarah Smith was beaten out by Democrat Adam Smith in Washington 's unusual Smith vs. Smith congressional race , and James Thompson lost in Kansas to Republican budget hawk Rep. Ron Estes . Ocasio-Cortez fave Ayanna Pressley , a non-DSA progressive , did win in Massachusetts .\nIn short , no red tide hiding inside a blue wave swept over Capitol Hill . There are n't even many socialists warming statehouse backbench seats this winter\u2014at press time only six additional DSA candidates had been declared victorious , alongside a handful of hyperlocal wins , such as for neighborhood commissions and boards of education .\nVoters are hardly going socialist either . DSA membership has grown from 7,000 to 50,000 since President Donald Trump was elected . But despite the prevalence of the red rose emojis that so-called New Socialists use to signal their allegiances on Twitter , and despite the ubiquity of Ocasio-Cortez 's red lipstick on cable news , those numbers are quite small . For perspective , the Libertarian Party has more than half a million registered voters .\nSocialists have not seized control of the country , but they did manage to grab a nice juicy handful of the debate .

Sen.

Sen. Kamala Harris ( D\u2013Calif . ) is offering a $ 500 monthly refundable tax credit to poor families with her Livable Incomes for Families Today ( LIFT ) Act , which is essentially the Earned Income Tax Credit on meth .
