    "content": "IOWA CITY , Iowa \u2013 Radiology technologist Jeff Dettbarn said he knew something was wrong at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Iowa City , Iowa , when a patient arrived in February 2017 for a CT scan , but the doctor \u2019 s order for it had been canceled .\n\u201c To have a patient show up for a scan and not have an order \u2013 you \u2019 re like , \u2018 What the heck is going on ? \u2019 \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview .\nDettbarn started collecting cancellation notices for diagnostic procedures such as CT scans , MRIs and ultrasounds .\n\u201c I knew something was not right , \u201d he said . \u201c Because none of them were canceled by a physician . \u201d\nCancellations of more than 250,000 radiology orders at VA hospitals across the country since 2016 have raised questions about whether \u2013 in a rush to clear out outdated and duplicate diagnostic orders \u2013 some facilities failed to follow correct procedures . At issue is a concern over whether some medically necessary orders for CT scans and other imaging tests were canceled improperly .\nThe VA inspector general is auditing mass cancellations at eight VA medical centers \u201c to determine whether VA processed radiology requests in a timely manner and appropriately managed canceled requests , \u201d VA Inspector General Michael Missal said .\nThose hospitals are in Tampa and Bay Pines , Florida ; Salisbury , North Carolina ; Cleveland ; Dallas ; Denver ; Las Vegas ; and Los Angeles .\nAfter receiving inquiries from \u2588\u2588\u2588 , a ninth was added \u2013 Iowa City .\nIn Iowa City , Dettbarn alerted the hospital \u2019 s compliance officer about his concerns . He is now facing disciplinary proceedings and contends they are an effort to retaliate against him .\nThe VA declined to comment on disciplinary proceedings without Dettbarn \u2019 s written consent to discuss personnel matters , which he did not provide .\nThis much is clear : in sworn testimony in the disciplinary proceedings against Dettbarn , Iowa City administrative staffer Lisa Bickford saidshe and other employees were told by the hospital \u2019 s chief radiologist that they needed to \u201c clean \u201d up a backlog of incomplete diagnostic orders , some dating back years .\nThe staff responded by \u201c annihilating \u201d thousands of orders in a matter of weeks , Bickford said .\nBryan Clark , a spokesman for the Iowa City hospital , acknowledged the facility failed to follow national VA guidelines for diagnostic order cancellations but said that happened in only a \u201c small number of instances \u201d and \u201c anything closed improperly was reviewed \u201d and actions were taken to try to ensure veterans received any needed exams . He said the process was intended to \u201c ensure the quality and safety of the care delivered to veteran patients . \u201d\nThe VA said many of the orders were outdated or duplicated . The agency said it welcomes the oversight and is working with the inspector general to improve cancellation guidelines . VA officials said efforts to close the loop on test orders with physicians and veterans surpass private-sector practices .\nLaurence Meyer , the chief doctor overseeing specialty care for the national VA , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he didn \u2019 t want to comment on how individual VA hospitals handled cancellations , but he acknowledged \u201c we \u2019 ve received word that a few places haven \u2019 t been following the directive as intended . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve sent out teams and have reviewed and are aggressively working to fix that , \u201d he said .\nThe VA \u2019 s guidelines on order cancellations have undergone revisions in the past few years .\nIn 2016 , hospitals were told to try contacting patients multiple times before cancellations . Last year , the rules required review by a radiologist or the ordering provider before canceling . If the tests were still needed , patients should be contacted to schedule them . Since last year , hospitals have been required to establish a fail-safe `` triage '' process , such as written verification of review by providers .\nConcerns about diagnostic test order cancellations have also been raised at the VA hospital in Tampa . Employees estimated they canceled thousands of radiology orders without checking first with doctors or patients , according to depositions in a discrimination lawsuit brought by four ultrasound technicians .\nThose technicians told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they worry veterans may have gone months , if not a year or longer , before they or their doctors realized tests weren \u2019 t performed \u2013 if they realized at all . Technologist Erin Tonkyro noted that risk factors for many veterans are higher than for other patients .\n\u201c Cancer grows very quickly , and our patients are not like those patients on the outside \u2013 it doesn \u2019 t mean that cancer doesn \u2019 t happen in private practice . But our veterans have been exposed to such a large amount of toxic environments like Agent Orange ; now we \u2019 re talking about the burn pits that have happened overseas , \u201d Tonkyro said .\nAt the Tampa facility , radiology managers began tackling outstanding orders in fall 2016 .\nAs many as 10 people were tasked with the job , one administrative staffer testified in a deposition in the technicians \u2019 lawsuit . Multiple employees testified they canceled orders by date and did not consult any doctors before doing so , nor was there patient contact .\nThey disabled office printers because of the volume of cancellations \u2013 one employee estimated they canceled thousands of radiology orders , according to testimony .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when we really started getting worried , \u201d said Tonkyro , who attended the depositions with her co-plaintiffs , ultrasound technologists Yenny Hernandez , Kara Mitchell-Davis and Dana Strauser . \u201c We knew it was bad , but we had no idea the magnitude of how bad it was . \u201d\nStrauser told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that administrators went beyond past orders and canceled future ones . Those could have been follow-up scans for veterans who might have been at risk of developing medical conditions , such as cancer recurrence .\n\u201c Doctors will put an order in for six months in advance and sometimes even a year in advance , and we were getting cancellations of those future orders , \u201d she said .\nIn a statement issued by VA spokesman Curt Cashour , the VA declined to comment on what happened in Tampa , citing the litigation . \u201c However , we are confident the James A. Haley Veterans \u2019 Hospital has processes and procedures in place to provide the best care possible for our patients , \u201d the statement said .\nThe Tampa Bay Times first reported the technicians \u2019 concerns in July , and the hospital \u2019 s chief of staff , Colleen Jakey , wrote to providers the following month asking them to review canceled orders , according to a copy of the correspondence obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c We believe appropriate action was taken , \u201d Jakey wrote , adding that a review of a random sample of cancellations did not turn up any cases of harm to veterans . \u201c This is a second-level review of these orders to confirm that each of these patients received the appropriate care and/or follow up . \u201d\nThe technicians told \u2588\u2588\u2588 some doctors have since reordered canceled exams but won \u2019 t know whether veteran patients suffered any harm from the delays until they are performed and assessed .\nVA hospitals came under increasing pressure to address outstanding diagnostic orders after a conference call that national officials convened with radiology managers across the country in January 2017 . More than 325,000 orders for scans of veteran patients had not been completed nationwide .\nThe VA \u2019 s top radiologist , Robert Sherrier , called it \u201c an important patient safety issue \u201d in a presentation for the call .\n\u201c Ordered studies are not being performed on veterans , and providers may not be aware that the ordered study has not been completed , \u201d he said .\nIn a dozen states , there were VA medical centers with more than 5,000 outstanding orders , his presentation said . The numbers reached 29,000 in Columbia , S.C. ; 21,000 in Cleveland ; and 12,000 in Washington .\nSome dated back to the 1980s , but others were only months old . VA officials said that in some cases , staff may not have been able to contact veterans to schedule exams . In other cases , veterans may not have shown up , possibly because their ailments had gone away . Some orders may have been duplicates ordered by two different doctors .\nOthers may have been tests that were still needed \u2013 to monitor tumors or follow up on emergency room visits , for example .\nA panel of medical and ethics specialists conducted thousands of chart reviews , Meyer said , and determined orders for exams due to be performed before June 2015 could be canceled outright without jeopardizing veteran health .\nOrders due after that date required further steps to ensure patient safety .\nThe national call to action triggered a dramatic reduction in pending exam orders overdue by two months or longer . As of last month , the VA said , there were 31,000 nationwide .\nAt the Iowa City VA hospital , Bickford said the chief of radiology \u2013 who also was the top radiology official in the Midwest for the VA \u2013 told her after the conference call in January 2017 that the facility had more outstanding orders than any other VA in the region .\n\u201c He came to ( us ) and said , \u2018 We \u2019 ve got to get this cleaned up now . I mean , we look terrible , \u2019 \u201d Bickford said . So she and other staff \u201c went through and started annihilating orders , \u201d she testified in the disciplinary proceeding against Dettbarn .\nAny radiology orders more than 60 days past due were considered \u201c invalid \u201d and \u201c expired , \u201d Bickford testified . That is at odds with VA guidelines at the time requiring doctor reviews .\nCancellation records reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 show that in some instances , she and other staff canceled future orders .\nIn one case , a nurse practitioner ordered an ultrasound for September 2017 as a six-month follow-up for a veteran with a history of kidney stones . An X-ray technician canceled it in June 2017 , calling it an \u201c expired \u201d order .\nThat same month , records indicate , Bickford canceled an order for a follow-up CT scan to monitor a veteran \u2019 s lung nodules . The test wasn \u2019 t due to be performed until September 2017 . Also in June , she canceled a CT to monitor fluid in a patient \u2019 s lung not due until November 2017 . Records show Bickford selected \u201c patient failed to contact clinic \u201d in both cases . None of the records reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 contained personal information identifying patients .\nIn the disciplinary case against Dettbarn , his supervisors alleged he was \u201c disruptive \u201d and didn \u2019 t send one patient \u2019 s images to be interpreted \u2013 accusations he denied . The investigation was initiated soon after he reported his concerns about the order cancellations .\nThe Office of Special Counsel , a federal agency tasked with protecting whistle-blowers , is investigating , according to a letter from the office .\nBickford declined to comment and referred questions to the Iowa City VA . In her sworn testimony , she blamed scheduling clerks for not indicating on orders that exams were scheduled . That led employees to assume there was a \u201c dead order \u201d even though a patient had a future appointment , she said , but she estimated that occurred only \u201c maybe a half a dozen times. \u201d When patients arrived for appointments , the errors were discovered , new orders were created and the exams went ahead , she said .\nThe chief of radiology , Stanley Parker , did not respond to a message seeking comment at a number listed in public records . In his deposition in the case , he testified that he believed physician-review would have been done before canceling .\nClark , the hospital spokesman , said Bickford 's testimony about \u201c annihilating \u201d orders was not in context and referred to the \u201c success of the process to right size the number \u201d of outstanding radiology orders at the hospital .\nClark said he doesn \u2019 t know how many orders were canceled at the facility because officials didn \u2019 t track it , but he said more than 4,000 were canceled in January and February 2017 in the southern part of the Midwest region .\nClark said \u201c most \u201d canceled orders were from before 2015 , though he didn \u2019 t know how many . He said \u201c some \u201d exam orders were \u201c canceled without following proper policies or procedures . \u201d\nIn those instances , Clark said , \u201c appropriate personnel actions were taken to correct the behavior , and staff reviewed the cancellations to ensure every order that required action was appropriately reviewed by a radiology provider . \u201d\nDettbarn has been detailed to a job collating VA records since July 2017 .
