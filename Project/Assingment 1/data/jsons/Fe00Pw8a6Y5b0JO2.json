    "content": "A freeway intersection is seen in this aerial image above Fresno , California ( Reuters : Lucy Nicholson )\nNo to bridges to nowhere , yes to nuclear , a faster Internet , and R & D\nOne of Donald Trump \u2019 s signature policy proposals has been a massive infrastructure investment plan . This puts conservatives in a bind . After all , didn \u2019 t we denounce the Obama administration \u2019 s stimulus plan as a massive boondoggle that didn \u2019 t do anything to boost the economy but wasted resources ?\nAt the same time , we should recognize that there is ample conservative warrant for believing that the government should ensure that the United States has the world \u2019 s best infrastructure . Most free-market economists agree that infrastructure is one of the few worthwhile jobs that government can do . What \u2019 s more , as entrepreneur and Manhattan Institute fellow Jim Manzi pointed out in \u201c The New American System , \u201d in the Spring 2014 issue of National Affairs , government concern for infrastructure was actually a major booster of American prosperity in the 19th century , usually thought of as the halcyon days of small government . Such luminaries as Alexander Hamilton famously favored government public works , as did ( less famously ) Abraham Lincoln , who expanded Henry Clay \u2019 s agenda of investment in telegraphs and railroads . This communication and transportation network provided the backbone for America \u2019 s stunning late-19th-century growth , which made it the world \u2019 s richest nation well before it became a global power after World War I .\nThere is a good case that now is also a good time to spend on infrastructure . It \u2019 s not only that the economy could use the stimulus , which would probably be real if almost certainly lower than breathless Keynesian types would assume , or that interest rates on American debt are at all-time-lows , although those are factors . It \u2019 s that American infrastructure in key areas \u2014 such as transportation , the Internet , and energy \u2014 is subpar , and that quality infrastructure is a key asset in economic competition in a globalized economy .\nBut the question remains : What , exactly , does the Trump administration intend to do , and what might come out of Congress , where Democrats and big government are already salivating at the prospect of larding up a bridge-to-nowhere pretend-infrastructure bill ? This is an area where conservatives can play a key role , constructively engaging with an administration that holds both great potential and significant risks for conservative-minded policies . Conservatives can and indeed should support a major infrastructure initiative \u2014 so long as it is done right .\nHere are some key points on what that might look like .\n1 . First come the least sexy but most valuable parts : upgrading existing infrastructure . One major drawback of the Obama stimulus plan was technocratic white-elephant projects such as high-speed rail , which simply makes no sense outside the Acela Northeast Corridor ( both literally and figuratively ) . Meanwhile , many American roads and bridges don \u2019 t require rebuilding but do require upkeep and perhaps an overhaul .\n2 . That being said , there is still room for some major infrastructure projects . The main problem with these is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 red tape . Overlapping federal , state , and local regulations , union work rules , private lawsuits , and especially environmental rules all hold back projects for years , if not decades . To sidestep this , Congress create \u201c a class of federal \u2018 special national infrastructure projects \u2019 that would be exempted from numerous regulatory and related barriers , granted presumptive immunity from specific classes of lawsuits , and given expedited eminent-domain rights , \u201d Manzi proposes . \u201c Congress should link funding for such projects to special exemptions from analogous state-level and local regulations in those areas that want to benefit from the projects . \u201d\n3 . At the risk of uttering a clich\u00e9 , it remains the case that what the telegraph and the railroad were to the 19th century , and highways to the 20th , the Internet is to the 21st . The United States , despite being the nation that invented the Internet and keeps pioneering its new technologies , has abysmally low rankings when it comes to broadband penetration , let alone the best technologies , such as Gigabit fiber to the home . Meanwhile , South Korea , for instance , reaps massive economic fortunes from having high-quality broadband saturation . Because South Korea has such a fast Internet , and the United States \u2019 is so slow , it \u2019 s sometimes impossible to load a South Korean website from America \u2014 just as you \u2019 d never get a YouTube video to stream from a mid-1990s dial-up line . The Internet is so bad in the United States that Google famously started its own fiber Internet service simply to shame American Internet service providers into providing faster Internet service . The answer there is crony capitalism . Collectively , American localities , with the benign neglect of the federal government , grant utilities local monopolies or oligopolies so that they provide Internet access in exchange for wiring them up . As a result , service exists , but lack of competition means it is of poor quality . The federal government should start a vigorous bidding process for whoever wants to set up the fastest fixed and mobile broadband network , with the focus on results and time .\n4 . It \u2019 s also the case that America \u2019 s energy mix could be better . Again , there is a bitter irony . As conservatives never tire of pointing out , the United States has spearheaded an energy revolution in shale gas extraction and hydraulic fracking . This has created a global macroeconomic boon by sending oil prices to the floor , and it may prove a geopolitical game changer by making the Middle East less relevant in global affairs . This astonishing innovation happened behind the scenes and through the free market , even as white-elephant government project after white-elephant government project in trendy industries such as solar and wind collapsed spectacularly ( and at great expense to taxpayers ) . With that in mind , it \u2019 s the case that we can \u2019 t fund all our energy needs through oil , gas , and coal . They have significant operating costs and are commodities that suffer the vagaries of international markets . Meanwhile , while progressive fears about global warming are overblown , it \u2019 s true that the environmental cost of warming is probably not nil . The best energy solution for the future is nuclear , which is safe , clean , and very cheap to produce . Significant innovation has been happening in the nuclear arena in recent years , with technology visionaries such as Bill Gates funding nuclear power as the best energy source for the foreseeable future . The United States should embark on an ambitious plan to get the majority of its energy from new-generation nuclear sources by 2036 .\nWe don \u2019 t yet know whether Hyperloop will become a reality , but the example should still impress us . What other seemingly crazy infrastructure ideas are out there ?\n5 . Some of the infrastructure in which America should invest is infrastructure we haven \u2019 t thought of yet .

Since Musk put the idea out there , private funders and entrepreneurs have been taking the baton and exploring real-world , economical Hyperloop projects . We don \u2019 t yet know whether Hyperloop will become a reality , but the example should still impress us . What other seemingly crazy infrastructure ideas are out there ? As mentioned , the Internet has become a crucial part of our infrastructure , and it was invented by a government skunk-works project , DARPA .
