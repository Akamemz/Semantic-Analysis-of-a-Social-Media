    "content": "The United States tortured al Qaida detainees captured after the 9/11 attacks , President Obama acknowledged Friday , in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of CIA practices that he banned after taking office .\n`` We tortured some folks , '' Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House . `` We did some things that were contrary to our values . ''\nAddressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees , Obama said he believed the mistreatment happened because of the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack . He said Americans should not be too `` sanctimonious , '' about passing judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day .\nThat posture , which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency , explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program . To this day , many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture , which is a felony under U.S. law .\nStill , Obama 's remarks on Friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject , including a 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of `` so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , '' and `` brutal methods , '' but did not flatly say the U.S. has engaged in torture .\n`` I believe that waterboarding was torture and , whatever legal rationales were used , it was a mistake , '' he said in April 2009 .\nThe administration of President George W. Bush , authorized the use of harsh questioning techniques of militant detainees in the wake of the 9/11 attacks after deciding they did not amount to torture .\nObama told reporters the techniques were used because the United States was afraid more attacks were imminent .\n`` It 's important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had , '' he said . `` A lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots . ''\nObama on Friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report \u2014 that the brutal interrogations did n't produce life-saving intelligence , and that the CIA lied to other elements of the U.S. government about exactly what it was doing .\nThe president also expressed confidence in his CIA director , John Brennan , in the wake of an internal CIA report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed Senate computers .
