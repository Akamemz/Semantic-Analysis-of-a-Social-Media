But only the white ones .\nAccording to Pew Research , 54 percent of white voters under 30 voted for Romney and only 41 percent for Obama . That 's the same percentage Reagan got from the entire white population in 1980 . Even the Lena Dunham demographic -- white women under 30 -- slightly favored Romney .\nReagan got just 43 percent of young voters in 1980 -- and that was when whites were 88 percent of the electorate . Only 58 percent of today 's under-30 vote is white and it 's shrinking daily .\nWhat the youth vote shows is not that young people are nitwits who deserve lives of misery and joblessness , as I had previously believed , but that America is hitting the tipping point on our immigration policy .\nThe youth vote is a snapshot of elections to come if nothing is done to reverse the deluge of unskilled immigrants pouring into the country as a result of Ted Kennedy 's 1965 immigration act . Eighty-five percent of legal immigrants since 1968 have come from the Third World . A majority of them are in need of government assistance .\nWhites are 76 percent of the electorate over the age of 30 and only 58 percent of the electorate under 30 . Obama won the `` youth vote '' because it is the knife 's edge of a demographic shift , not because he offered the kids free tuition and contraception ( which they do n't need because it 's hard to have sex when you 're living with your parents at 27 ) .\nIn 1980 , Hispanics were only 2 percent of the population , and they tended to be educated , skilled workers who got married , raised their children in two-parent families and sent their kids to college before they , too , got married and had kids . ( In that order . )\nThat profile has nothing to do with recent Hispanic immigrants , who -- because of phony `` family reunification '' rules -- are the poorest of the world 's poor .\nMore than half of all babies born to Hispanic women today are illegitimate .
