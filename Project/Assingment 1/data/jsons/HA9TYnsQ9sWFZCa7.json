    "content": "The coronavirus epidemic this week reached Beadle County , South Dakota . A single case tied to travel has exploded into 14 infections and counting , with no way to know how many were exposed while supply shortages forced the entire state to briefly suspend testing .\nConfirmed cases in New York City , where hospitals have fallen into chaos as resources run thin , on Thursday surpassed Beadle \u2019 s entire population of 18,500 . With too few tests for too many cases , doctors there already had been told it no longer made sense to test most ill patients .\nFrom its biggest cities to its smallest towns , America \u2019 s chance to contain the coronavirus crisis came and went in the seven weeks since U.S. health officials botched the testing rollout and then misled scientists in state laboratories about this critical early failure . Federal regulators failed to recognize the spiraling disaster and were slow to relax the rules that prevented labs and major hospitals from advancing a backup .\nScientists around the country found themselves shackled as the disease spread .\n\u201c We were watching a tsunami and standing there frozen , \u201d said Dr. Debra Wadford , director of the public viral disease laboratory in California , where some of the country 's earliest patients were identified .\nThe nation \u2019 s public health pillars \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 shirked their responsibility to protect Americans in an emergency like this new coronavirus , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found in interviews with dozens of scientists , public health experts and community leaders , as well as email communications between laboratories and hospitals across the country .\nThe result was a cascading series of failures now costing lives .\nGet daily coronavirus updates in your inbox : Sign up for our newsletter now .\nCDC leaders not only bungled their role in developing the first coronavirus test permitted in the country , they also misrepresented the efficacy of early solutions to state health authorities .\nThen , public and private lab directors felt rebuffed by the FDA when they first offered to help troubleshoot the problem by developing their own tests . The agency , through its emergency authority , had placed restrictions on labs that can apply in emergencies but not in normal circumstances .\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said validating outside tests is essential in a crisis when `` false results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences . ''\nA reliable , accessible test was key to averting today \u2019 s disaster . Countries such as South Korea had already shown how such diagnostics \u2014 developed and scaled up with the help of the private sector at the onset \u2014 could be used to identify people with early infections before they spread the virus widely .\nIn late February , the CDC 's deputy director of infectious disease projected calm in a conference call with state laboratories . The labs were told they could now send samples to the CDC and receive results within 24 hours .\n\u201c That was a bald-faced lie , \u201d said Wadford . At that point , she was waiting four to five days on test results for samples she had sent to the CDC .\n\u201c The most disappointing part was that they couldn \u2019 t just be frank and straight with us , \u201d said Wadford , who took detailed notes of the conference call that she dictated to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Tell us the situation . Don \u2019 t sugarcoat it and lie . But to mislead us is just not right . \u201d\nThe following week , President Trump tweeted : \u201c The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA . We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries . CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart . Stock Market starting to look very good to me ! \u201d\nSince then , the U.S. went from 51 confirmed cases to more than 100,000 , from zero deaths to over 1,900 as of Friday , while the economic toll of shuttering wide swaths of the country has cost millions their jobs and pummeled the stock market .\nCaccomo denied that the FDA was overly restrictive at the onset of the outbreak and then slow to adapt to the `` unprecedented public health emergency. \u201d The agency worked with outside labs as early as Jan. 22 , she said , before opening up the emergency authorization process at the end of February .\n`` As the emergency evolved , '' Caccomo added , `` FDA determined that the benefits of increased testing capacity outweighed the risks associated with use of additional tests . ''\nThe time lost in February was critical to containing the outbreak and helping hospitals prepare , experts say . With each delay , the virus spread undetected as people likely unaware of an infection attended conferences and weddings , frequented bars and restaurants and took long-planned cruise vacations .\nAmerica is now paying the price . More than half of the country \u2019 s population has been ordered to stay home to slow the spread . Doctors are rationing supplies . Like New York City , communities have limited testing because the outbreak has grown so large that hospitals must instead target the most vulnerable .\nREAD : Coronavirus lockdowns : These states are ordering residents to stay home or shelter in place\nFrom Texas to New York \u2013\u2013 the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak \u2013\u2013 medical facilities burned through protective supplies , including masks , almost immediately , in part because doctors did not have widespread access to tests a month ago , forcing them to take extensive precautions with all patients showing symptoms .\nNew York City health officials now recommend against testing patients who do not require hospitalization , even if they have symptoms such as fever , to preserve limited resources . In viral social media posts , doctors describe hospitals overrun with the sick and dying . Patients with symptoms wait in clinic lines for up to 11 hours to get tested .\nDr. Alan Bigman , who runs a multi-speciality medical practice there , has agonized over an impossible position : pull patients away from jobs and out of the community without a diagnosis or risk running out of testing supplies for the next person who walks into the clinic .\n\u201c They have kids , and they have neighbors , \u201d he said . \u201c I need to know if they are positive or not . \u201d\nThe crisis may soon be just as dire in rural communities . As of mid-March , Dr. April Abbott , the microbiology lab director at the largest hospital chain in southern Indiana , said she could not get equipment to run her own tests , in part because the federal government does not consider her area a priority like New York or California .\nHotspots could be hiding across the country . Smart thermometer company , Kinsa , recently noted an unusually high volume of fevers in east Texas and northern New Mexico , for instance , places where reported infections \u2013 and tests \u2013 remain low .\n\u201c We 're not able to get testing supplies because we ca n't prove we need them , \u201d Abbott said , \u201c And we ca n't prove we need them because we ca n't perform the tests . \u201d\nAbbott initially looked into sending her Deaconess Hospital patients \u2019 samples to other labs . But the state-run lab told her they were too overwhelmed by a bottleneck of demand to take them . Increasingly alarmed , she sent emails to private companies pleading for them to loan her equipment to run tests .\n\u201c Below Indianapolis , our state has virtually no functional testing capability , \u201d Abbott wrote to a diagnostics company on March 16 . \u201c I can not overemphasize the lack of testing available in our region . \u201d\nEventually she found labs in other states to take her samples , but results took almost two weeks .\n\u201c The infrastructure has failed us , \u201d Abbott said in an interview . As of mid-week , Indiana had confirmed just 645 cases of coronavirus .\nSimilar concerns were raised in South Dakota , where the resource-strapped state lab has lagged far behind others . Fewer than 2,200 test results were reported by the state as of Thursday , with 46 confirmed positive .\nHealth officials there had to suspend testing briefly just as its cases started to rise because the government 's lab \u2014 then the only in-state option \u2014 ran out of testing supplies .\n\u201c I am absolutely appalled at what is going on , \u201d said Ashley Kingdon-Reese , a home health care operator in Huron , South Dakota , who knows about a patient with likely exposure who continued to visit with family .\nShe fears the community was broadly exposed by these kinds of comings and goings while tests were backlogged .\nPeople who could be spreading the virus , she said , \u201c have been in the public the whole time . \u201d\nSince early January , a virus raging in China had the attention of public health experts . A coronavirus , it was the newest member of a large family of viruses whose evils include the common cold . The name refers to how it looks under a microscope , with crown-like spikes on its surface .\nU.S. intelligence communities soon began warning of a global pandemic , which The Washington Post reported last week was downplayed by the Trump administration .\nAfter the first American case turned up in Seattle in late January , an infectious disease expert there began asking state and federal officials to let her repurpose nasal swab flu tests for the new coronavirus . The answer , the New York Times reported : no .\nTwenty-plus years of public health preparedness drills dictated what the government should have done next : mobilize state , hospital and commercial laboratories to develop testing to isolate the sick and buy time for hospitals to activate plans for handling a surge .\n\u201c When you see a disaster coming , you want to go big and go now , \u201d said Dr. Tara O \u2019 Toole , who helped develop pandemic response plans in the Department of Homeland Security under former President Barack Obama .\nBut for weeks , the federal testing push fell further and further behind .\nOn Jan. 31 , after Americans began returning stateside from the outbreak \u2019 s origin in Wuhan , China , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency , but called the threat to this country \u201c low . \u201d\nShortly after , the FDA gave the CDC authority through an emergency use authorization to begin rolling out a diagnostic test kit for the state public health labs .\nIf any scientists at universities , the public labs or private facilities wanted to develop their own tests \u2014 which they sometimes call \u201c home brew \u201d \u2014 or adopt the World Health Organization \u2019 s , they would need to submit separate applications with 28 pages of guidelines .\nLabs found the process more burdensome than any other regulation they deal with .\nUnder normal circumstances , scientists can run various tests without special FDA approval . But emergency orders shift the regulatory landscape , imposing restrictions . Experts say the agency moved far too slowly to lift them , given the magnitude of the building crisis .\nInstead , the FDA stuck with one of the most restrictive approaches possible , according to Dr. Josh Sharfstein , a former deputy commissioner at FDA .\n\u201c The response has been backwards , \u201d said Sharfstein , now vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University , who advocates for more regulation during non-emergencies and less in urgent situations like this one .\nThe FDA , an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services , regulates according to laws passed by Congress and guidance laid out by the administration . Yet Trump has blamed the initial approach on the prior administration , which he said created barriers that made it difficult to rapidly ramp up testing .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t take responsibility at all , \u201d he said at a news conference two weeks ago .\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment and directed \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the health department , which also did not respond .\nDr. Margaret Hamburg , who served as commissioner of the FDA under former president Barack Obama and helped oversee the agency \u2019 s response to the H1N1 flu outbreak , said there was nothing stopping the administration from acting sooner .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been confused by those characterizations of the FDA \u2019 s inability to move swiftly in a crisis , \u201d Hamburg said .\nThe federal emergency declaration allowed the CDC to begin distributing test kits to state health department labs across the nation in early February .\nRight away , a problem surfaced . California received its kits on a Friday . Scientists worked through the weekend , discovering that some components of the CDC \u2019 s test were flawed and produced inconclusive results .\nThe issue centered on one of the three testing components , or reagents , used to detect the new virus , COVID-19 .\nREAD : 'Not gone as smoothly as we would have liked ' : CDC fixes coronavirus testing kit glitch\nOn Sunday , Wadford , one of the directors of the California public health lab , frantically messaged colleagues at the Association of Public Health Laboratories . She wanted to know if other labs had encountered the same problem .\n\u201c We are hearing of it from at least one state lab , \u201d an official from the laboratory association wrote back in an email . \u201c Seems like it might be real . \u201d\nThe CDC promised to quickly fix the test . But for two weeks , the agency offered temporary solutions \u2014 such as creating a new \u201c surge \u201d lab and offering to receive samples at CDC headquarters in Atlanta .\nThose patches themselves were so flawed that results that took days were often inconclusive , too , according to Wadford . At one point , the surge lab also failed to immediately notify the state labs of positive cases by phone , as they had done earlier in crises .\n`` This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked , '' Dr. Nancy Messonnier , director of its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , told reporters in late February .\nNoting that the U.S. had few cases at the time , she added : `` To date , our strategies have been largely successful . ''\nThe agency did not respond to a request for additional comment under deadline .\nBy the third week of February , still with no permanent solution in place , the FDA was well aware of the problem .\nOn Feb. 24 \u2014 the same day Trump tweeted \u201c the Coronavirus is very much under control \u201d \u2014 Scott Becker , executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories , sent a letter to the FDA begging the agency to scale back its original strategy and lift the home-brew restrictions preventing them from making their own tests .\nAround the same time , more than 100 scientists in private labs and universities penned a similar letter to Congress .\n\u201c They are first responders with lab coats and they couldn \u2019 t actually gown up , \u201d Becker said in an interview , calling the situation at that stage desperate .\nOn Feb. 29 , the administration changed course and began rolling back the restrictions . The new strategy allowed both private and public labs to use a modified version of the CDC test and start developing their own .\nIn the coming days and weeks , the FDA continued to ease restrictions to make it easier for others to come online with tests , including commercial laboratories .\nExperts criticize the agency , however , for moving slowly given the magnitude of the health epidemic unfolding .\n\u201c CDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the U.S. , \u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden , a former CDC director , noting that commercial labs and hospitals play critical roles in reaching the scale required in a major epidemic such as the new coronavirus .\nDuring these lost weeks in February , federal officials missed their chance to contain the outbreak before it swept across the country , unseen .\nAt Texas Children \u2019 s Hospital , doctors lament the weeks that passed without an in-house test to show in hours , not days , what they were dealing with .\nDr. Jim Dunn , director of medical microbiology and virology at the hospital , had developed lab tests for the Zika virus for weeks before the FDA stepped in . He said the restrictions this time prevented Texas Children \u2019 s from getting out in front of COVID-19 .\n\u201c They pulled the plug before we even had a chance to get going , \u201d said Dunn , noting that the hospital expended resources in the early days when doctors didn \u2019 t know who did and didn \u2019 t have the virus . \u201c It could have affected how the masks were allocated . \u201d\nSouth Dakota , initially appearing largely untouched by the epidemic , nonetheless rallied its emergency planners .\nIn Beadle County , the Huron Regional Medical Center rolled out a testing protocol that leaders now acknowledge was aggressive to the point of overuse .\nClinicians burned through supplies , using four nasal swabs to run testing for COVID-19 and other respiratory concerns . The protocol was eventually scaled back to one swab per nostril , then one per patient .\nAs the state lab backlogged , with limited supplies to process the tests , people with suspected cases were urged to self-quarantine .\n\u201c When we started out , there was no shortage of supplies , \u201d said Dr. Jake Redden , the hospital \u2019 s vice president of quality , who coordinated with state health officials .\nTesting hit a snag just as an early cluster of travel-related cases surfaced in the county of 18,500 people within a state whose entire population is less than 900,000 .\nLacking a crucial chemical used to process the test , in short supply nationally , South Dakota \u2019 s public testing lab posted a notice online last Wednesday that it had temporarily suspended testing .\n\u201c It was alarming , \u201d said Dr. Robert Summerer , president of the South Dakota State Medical Association .\nThe lack of test data presented a challenge for members of the association , who were trying to draft guidelines for the governor on closing restaurants and cancelling elective surgeries . No one knew whether the state really had few cases or was clueless for lack of test results .\nOther states had commercial and hospital-based labs running , but South Dakota still lacked an in-state backup .\nThe day after the state halted testing , Republican governor Kristi Noem told the White House on a conference call that it had been juggling shortage issues for two weeks .\nShe described how the CDC kept directing the state to private suppliers , which would cancel orders for the chemical reagent at the last minute . After getting \u201c a little pushy , \u201d she said enough supplies had come in for her state to resume processing tests .\n\u201c I need to understand how you \u2019 re triaging supplies , \u201d she told the White House , according to a transcript of the call . \u201c I just don \u2019 t want to not be a priority area , because we \u2019 re a smaller state or less populated . \u201d\nWith limited supplies , however , the state lab focused on processing cases identified as higher priority . As of early this week , authorities were awaiting results from 700 tests sent out of state to be processed by labs with four- to five-day turnaround times .\nBeadle County \u2019 s cases already had multiplied as test results came back .\nThe day before the governor \u2019 s White House call , Beadle County had a single case .\nOn the day that Noem spoke with Trump , the count rose to four .\nBy Sunday , when city and county officials voted in an emergency session to shut down restaurants , gyms and movie theaters , there were 10 .\nTesting has ramped up within the state this week . So has fear .\nThe mayor of Beadle \u2019 s county seat , Huron , issued a news release to combat rumors circulating on social media that the virus had arrived in their community via its significant population of Karen immigrants from Myanmar . He noted the cases reported to that point all were white residents .\n\u201c If we \u2019 d have had better testing supplies , \u201d Huron Mayor Paul Aylward told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c we could have been ahead of this curve . \u201d",

She wanted to know if other labs had encountered the same problem.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing of it from at least one state lab,\u201d an official from the laboratory association wrote back in an email. \u201cSeems like it might be real.\u201d\n\nThe CDC promised to quickly fix the test. But for two weeks, the agency offered temporary solutions \u2014 such as creating a new \u201csurge\u201d lab and offering to receive samples at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nThose patches themselves were so flawed that results that took days were often inconclusive, too, according to Wadford. At one point, the surge lab also failed to immediately notify the state labs of positive cases by phone, as they had done earlier in crises.\n\nThe CDC has acknowledged problems with its testing development.\n\n\"This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in late February.\n\nNoting that the U.S. had few cases at the time, she added: \"To date, our strategies have been largely successful.\"\n\nThe agency did not respond to a request for additional comment under deadline.\n\nBy the third week of February, still with no permanent solution in place, the FDA was well aware of the problem.\n\nOn Feb. 24 \u2014 the same day Trump tweeted \u201cthe Coronavirus is very much under control\u201d \u2014 Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, sent a letter to the FDA begging the agency to scale back its original strategy and lift the home-brew restrictions preventing them from making their own tests.\n\nAround the same time, more than 100 scientists in private labs and universities penned a similar letter to Congress.\n\n\u201cThey are first responders with lab coats and they couldn\u2019t actually gown up,\u201d Becker said in an interview, calling the situation at that stage desperate.\n\nOn Feb. 29, the administration changed course and began rolling back the restrictions. The new strategy allowed both private and public labs to use a modified version of the CDC test and start developing their own.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, the FDA continued to ease restrictions to make it easier for others to come online with tests, including commercial laboratories.\n\nExperts criticize the agency, however, for moving slowly given the magnitude of the health epidemic unfolding.\n\n\u201cCDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the U.S.,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, noting that commercial labs and hospitals play critical roles in reaching the scale required in a major epidemic such as the new coronavirus.\n\nDuring these lost weeks in February, federal officials missed their chance to contain the outbreak before it swept across the country, unseen.\n\nAs testing ramped up, states found themselves behind\n\nAt Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, doctors lament the weeks that passed without an in-house test to show in hours, not days, what they were dealing with.\n\nDr. Jim Dunn, director of medical microbiology and virology at the hospital, had developed lab tests for the Zika virus for weeks before the FDA stepped in. He said the restrictions this time prevented Texas Children\u2019s from getting out in front of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThey pulled the plug before we even had a chance to get going,\u201d said Dunn, noting that the hospital expended resources in the early days when doctors didn\u2019t know who did and didn\u2019t have the virus. \u201cIt could have affected how the masks were allocated.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota, initially appearing largely untouched by the epidemic, nonetheless rallied its emergency planners.\n\nIn Beadle County, the Huron Regional Medical Center rolled out a testing protocol that leaders now acknowledge was aggressive to the point of overuse.\n\nClinicians burned through supplies, using four nasal swabs to run testing for COVID-19 and other respiratory concerns. The protocol was eventually scaled back to one swab per nostril, then one per patient.\n\nAs the state lab backlogged, with limited supplies to process the tests, people with suspected cases were urged to self-quarantine.\n\n\u201cWhen we started out, there was no shortage of supplies,\u201d said Dr. Jake Redden, the hospital\u2019s vice president of quality, who coordinated with state health officials.\n\nTesting hit a snag just as an early cluster of travel-related cases surfaced in the county of 18,500 people within a state whose entire population is less than 900,000.\n\nLacking a crucial chemical used to process the test, in short supply nationally, South Dakota\u2019s public testing lab posted a notice online last Wednesday that it had temporarily suspended testing.\n\n\u201cIt was alarming,\u201d said Dr. Robert Summerer, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association.\n\nThe lack of test data presented a challenge for members of the association, who were trying to draft guidelines for the governor on closing restaurants and cancelling elective surgeries. No one knew whether the state really had few cases or was clueless for lack of test results.\n\nOther states had commercial and hospital-based labs running, but South Dakota still lacked an in-state backup.\n\nThe day after the state halted testing, Republican governor Kristi Noem told the White House on a conference call that it had been juggling shortage issues for two weeks.\n\nShe described how the CDC kept directing the state to private suppliers, which would cancel orders for the chemical reagent at the last minute. After getting \u201ca little pushy,\u201d she said enough supplies had come in for her state to resume processing tests.\n\n\u201cI need to understand how you\u2019re triaging supplies,\u201d she told the White House, according to a transcript of the call. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to not be a priority area, because we\u2019re a smaller state or less populated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will never happen to your state,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nWith limited supplies, however, the state lab focused on processing cases identified as higher priority. As of early this week, authorities were awaiting results from 700 tests sent out of state to be processed by labs with four- to five-day turnaround times.\n\nBeadle County\u2019s cases already had multiplied as test results came back.\n\nThe day before the governor\u2019s White House call, Beadle County had a single case.\n\nOn the day that Noem spoke with Trump, the count rose to four.\n\nBy Sunday, when city and county officials voted in an emergency session to shut down restaurants, gyms and movie theaters, there were 10.\n\nREAD:Gov. Kristi Noem confirms more coronavirus cases in state\n\nTesting has ramped up within the state this week. So has fear.\n\nThe mayor of Beadle\u2019s county seat, Huron, issued a news release to combat rumors circulating on social media that the virus had arrived in their community via its significant population of Karen immigrants from Myanmar. He noted the cases reported to that point all were white residents.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d have had better testing supplies,\u201d Huron Mayor Paul Aylward told USA TODAY, \u201cwe could have been ahead of this curve.\u201d\n\nData reporter Kevin Crowe contributed to this report.\n\nBrett Murphy and Letitia Stein are reporters on the USA TODAY national investigations team.
