It is the first such test to receive approval for the U.S. market . And it comes at a time when health experts and leaders are embracing immunity as a potential end point to the pandemic . In Colorado , a company that makes a coronavirus antibody test has donated kits to the state \u2019 s San Miguel County so that everyone there can be tested if they want to .
