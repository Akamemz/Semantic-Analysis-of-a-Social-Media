That 's the riddle facing Democrats in 2020 .\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week put numbers on what has long been a visceral cultural nostalgia for the 44th presidency . Ninety percent of Democrats hold a favorable view of Barack Obama today , compared with just 4 % unfavorable ( Bill Clinton , by contrast , is at 64/15 ) . Sixty-nine percent hold a `` very positive '' view of Obama , up 8 percentage points over 2015 . Most relevant , 78 % say they are `` satisfied '' that the previous occupant of the White House `` did as much as was possible at the time in addressing issues facing the country .

That was in response to the president assuring lawmakers that Obamacare would n't cover immigrants in the U.S. illegally .

At this point in the 2012 campaign , Obama was still cracking down on state-legal marijuana dispensaries and laughing derisively when asked about legalizing recreational pot .

This month , not only did all the candidates speaking about it at the debate agree to bring the troops home , there was even talk of restoring the legislative branch 's constitutional role in declaring war , a notion that Obama brazenly flouted in Libya .\nBut on economic and spending issues , the recent Democratic past \u2014 including Obama 's campaign promise of a `` net spending cut '' \u2014 might as well be another planet . Such has been the outsize role of Sen.
