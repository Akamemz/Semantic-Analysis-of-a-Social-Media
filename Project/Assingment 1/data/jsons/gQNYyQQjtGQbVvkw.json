    "content": "In what has become an all-too-familiar occurrence , an apparent terrorist attack has once again struck the European public , this time at a concert by American singer Ariana Grande in Manchester , England , attended by thousands of pre-teen and teenaged girls .\nAt the time of writing , the death toll was at 22 , with more than 50 injured in what has been described as a suicide bombing just at the foyer of the Manchester Arena . Media reports and recent patterns suggest that the perpetrator is likely another radicalized , lone-wolf attacker , perhaps inspired by the so-called Islamic State , which has already claimed responsibility .\nBut despite the horror of the situation \u2013 indeed , because of it \u2013 it is important to look at underlying issues . Some questions to consider as the details of the attack unfold :\nWho did it ? This is less a question of what terrorist group may be behind it than a question of who the bomber was himself , and where he came from . Police have identified the perpetrator as 22-year-old Salman Abedi , who was born in Manchester to parents who fled Libya 's Qaddafi regime . Their investigation is ongoing into whether he acted alone or had help . But terrorist attacks in Europe are , by and large , a homegrown affair . The July 7 London bombers , the Lee Rigby murder , the Bataclan attack , the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice , all were committed by either European citizens or European residents . Many of the perpetrators were radicalized domestically , often during prison time for low- to mid-level crimes . And though often made the scapegoat , immigrants \u2013 and refugees in particular \u2013 generally have not made up a significant portion of the attackers .\nThat is not to say that terrorist groups do not play a role . Indeed , ISIS has already claimed to have a role \u2013 they are so quick to claim any such attack , in fact , that one must take their word with a grain of salt . But certainly such radical groups , Islamic State or otherwise , could have helped fuel the engine that drove the Manchester attack , either through ideological , technological , or psychological support online . But the spark of the attack may well prove to be of domestic origin , in which case Britain must look inward for solutions , not outward .\nCould the attack realistically have been stopped ? It \u2019 s very easy to fall into the trap of thinking that just a little more security could have prevented the events in Manchester . If the event security cordon had been another 100 feet out , if the police had knocked on one more door , if intel agents had one more phone tap on suspected Islamist militants in the city , the attack could have been thwarted . Right ?\nWell , perhaps . Certainly , there will be those who espouse even greater security as the way to prevent repeats in future . But that logic only works if the sole goal of the perpetrators is to blow up a specific target , like the Ariana Grande show , and that \u2019 s almost certainly not the case . For terrorism to be successful , most any crowded target would do . Even if Ms. Grande \u2019 s show could be terror-proofed , at whatever expense that might entail , terrorists could simply switch to a different target . If they do , they still fulfill their objective by killing dozens , and all the effort put into iron-cladding security is mooted .\nThe point to keep in mind is that increasing security comes with decreasing returns .

The most upsetting aspect of the Manchester attack is that it targeted an event primarily attended by the teenage and pre-teen girls that make up Ms. Grande \u2019 s fan base .
