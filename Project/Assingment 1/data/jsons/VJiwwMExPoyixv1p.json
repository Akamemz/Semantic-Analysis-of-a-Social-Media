A debate about how to enforce the existing law tends to supersede discussion of what the law ought to say .\nAll of this misses the core point . Immigration to the United States has not , historically , been an act of kindness toward strangers . It \u2019 s been a strategy for national growth and national greatness .\nWashington and his fellow founders could have established America as a kind of exclusive club . The present-day United States undoubtedly would still be a prosperous and pleasant nation . But our cities would be smaller , our global influence would be reduced , and many fewer of the world \u2019 s cutting-edge companies would be based here . We would suffer , as small countries tend to , from our talented and ambitious young people seeking their fortunes in bigger places abroad . With many fewer people , it wouldn \u2019 t be the great nation it is today .\nWhile a lot has changed since Washington \u2019 s time , two fundamentals have not . The United States is still a country with a mission and a desire for greatness on the world stage . And America \u2019 s openness to people who want to move here and make a better life for themselves is fuel for that greatness .\nFew of our problems can be solved by curtailing immigration . Many could be solved by welcoming more foreigners to our shores .\nThe main sources of immigration \u2014 and the main occupations likely to employ immigrants \u2014 have changed over time , but the story has been the same from the beginning .

To an extent in the modern world , that means access to global markets \u2014 grain can be shipped to Europe and timber to Japan . But for most people , it means direct access to other people , who serve as customers and co-workers and suppliers .\nLionel Fontagn\u00e9 and Gianluca Santoni find that heavily populated areas offer higher labor productivity and higher pay because \u201c denser commuting zones seem to offer a better match between employers and employees. \u201d The more people there are around , the more different kinds of businesses you can have and the more finely specialized they can be , meaning it \u2019 s more likely that any given person will be well-suited to work at someplace or other that \u2019 s in town . This is in some ways most obvious at the routine retail level \u2014 big cities have specialty shops and very focused restaurants rather than general stores and generic diners \u2014 but research by Jason Abel , Ishita Dey , and Todd Gabe finds that the positive impact on density on productivity is especially true in knowledge-intensive industries .\nThose findings are not immigration-specific , but the beginning of wisdom on immigration policy is that immigrants are people .\nAnd , indeed , when you take the foreigner element out of it , most people correctly grasp that depopulation is not an economic growth strategy . Texans \u2014 often especially the most conservative ones \u2014 brag about how many people move there from other states , fueling the growth of dynamic metropolitan economies . When people have children , it , of course , imposes a short-term cost on the local educational system . But it also builds the long-term future of the national community .\nBy the same token , there is a fairly firm consensus that immigration raises incomes on average for native-born workers . When the University of Chicago \u2019 s Booth School surveyed a panel of well-known academic economists , for example , 52 percent agreed that admitting more low-skilled immigrants to the United States would make the average US citizen better off . Just 9 percent disagreed . The panel agreed that more highly skilled immigrants would be good by an even more overwhelming 89-0 margin .\nThis is not , incidentally , because an increase in the labor supply has no adverse effects for anyone . Rather , as Heidi Shierholz of the liberal Economic Policy Institute emphasizes in her overview of the literature , it \u2019 s that \u201c earlier immigrants are the group that \u2019 s most adversely affected by immigration \u201d because they are the people whose skill sets are most likely to put them in direct competition with new immigrants . Across a range of estimates , the effects on wages \u201c tend to be very small , and on average , modestly positive . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s because , as Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney of the center-left Hamilton Project put it , \u201c immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs ; instead , many immigrants complement the work of U.S. employees and increase their productivity . \u201d\nIf a bunch of new monolingual Spanish-speaking construction laborers move to town , in other words , that probably is bad news for the monolingual Spanish-speaking construction laborers \u2014 mostly immigrants \u2014 who are already there . But the presence of those laborers in town will create job opportunities for people to manage them , likely native-born workers who speak English . And by increasing the number of construction projects that are undertaken , they increase the demand for more skilled tradespeople \u2014 plumbers , electricians , and others whose work is complementary to that of more generic laborers .\nImmigration skeptics often pivot from the basic terrain of labor market economics to the notion that immigrants \u2014 especially the dreaded illegal ones \u2014 are a drain on public resources . Donald Trump went so far as to repeatedly claim on the campaign trail that undocumented workers are actually receiving more generous public services than America \u2019 s veterans .\nThis idea plays a critical architectural role in holding together the political coalition of contemporary conservatism \u2014 selling the idea that tax cutting is compatible with financial support for the elderly because there will be plenty of money for everyone once we get rid of the foreign-born leeches .\nBut it \u2019 s completely false . Unauthorized workers receive few if any public services ( they ride the bus , but they \u2019 re ineligible for social assistance programs ) but contribute to the tax base . Indeed , since people living and working in the United States illegally are often paying Social Security taxes without collecting benefits , they are in some ways the great heroes of the US Treasury .\nFor the immigrant population at large , the best research on the fiscal impact of immigration comes from the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine , which concluded that over the course of a 75-year time horizon , \u201c the fiscal impacts of immigrants are generally positive at the federal level and generally negative at the state and local level. \u201d Immigrants , in other words , pay more to the federal government in taxes than they receive in benefits , while the reverse is true for state and local governments .\nThis adverse impact on state and local governments is important , and derives largely from the fact that immigrants have kids who end up needing to go to school . The good news is that those kids grow up to be second-generation adults who \u201c contribute the most of any generation to the bottom line of state balance sheets . \u201d\nThe bigger picture is that the long-run structure of the American welfare state , which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly , requires a growing population and economy . Immigrants contribute to both goals , directly through their presence in the country and indirectly by raising children . Indeed , it \u2019 s striking that even an immigration skeptic like George Borjas concedes that immigrants grow the economy and do not personally obtain 100 percent of the benefits of that growth \u2014 meaning their presence increases the overall level of resources available to the native population .\nImmigrants may build American prosperity , but there \u2019 s more to life than economics . For Trump , the central mode of anti-immigrant rhetoric has always been a more visceral fear of violence , from his initial warning of an incoming flood of Mexican rapists to the various efforts to limit Muslims \u2019 ability to travel to the United States . He \u2019 s even issued an executive order mandating the creation of a new federal bureaucracy , VOICE , with the specific mission of publicizing crimes committed by immigrants .\n\u201c We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests , \u201d he told a joint session of Congress .\nTo the extent that you want to whip people into an anti-immigrant fervor , it \u2019 s a good idea . There are millions of foreign-born people in the United States , and naturally every day some of them are caught committing crimes . Indeed , because immigrants are younger on average than native-born Americans , they commit a somewhat disproportionate share of crime .\nBut as Bianca Bersani of the University of Massachusetts has shown , on a year-by-year basis , young immigrants are much less likely to be involved in criminal activity . Indeed , the great trajectory of immigration and crime is that second-generation youth \u2014 kids whose parents were born abroad \u2014 largely assimilate to US behavior norms rather than maintaining the better behavior of their foreign-born parents .\n\u201c Born and socialized in the U.S. mainstream , \u201d Bersani writes , \u201c second-generation immigrants are simply native-born youth . \u201d\nThere is a very real social problem of youth crime in the United States \u2014 especially because the widespread availability of guns makes American crime much deadlier than crime in Europe or Asia \u2014 but immigrants contribute to it only in the sense that they add to the overall population . On a per-person basis , immigrants are better-behaved than natives and immigrants \u2019 kids are worse-behaved than their parents because they learn to act more like Americans .\nNo issue in economics is entirely unanimous , and because immigration is a contentious issue in partisan politics , it sometimes leads the media to overplay the extent of expert disagreement about the economics of immigration . Consequently , the work of George Borjas , a Harvard Kennedy School professor who has produced the bulk of the research dissenting from the optimistic consensus , tends to play an outsize role in the media landscape .\nHis work , summarized for an expert audience in his 2014 book Immigration Economics and for a popular audience in his 2016 book We Wanted Workers , is an outlier in both its conclusions and its methodology .\nOne big difference , as UC Berkeley \u2019 s David Card and UC Davis \u2019 s Giovanni Peri point out in their review of Immigration Economics , comes down to the annoying technical question of how you should measure the number of immigrants in a given labor market . A naive way to make the case for immigration would be to do something like note that the list of states with the smallest foreign-born population is led by West Virginia and also includes Mississippi , Kentucky , and Alabama in the bottom 10 . Immigrant-heavy states such as California , New York , New Jersey , Maryland , and Massachusetts are much more prosperous .\nThe problem here , of course , is that while it \u2019 s possible that West Virginia is so poor because no foreigners move there , it \u2019 s equally likely that no foreigners move to West Virginia precisely because it \u2019 s poor . A reasonable economic study needs to look at change over time , in both the number of immigrants and labor market outcomes for the native-born .\nMost researchers do this by studying the correlation between the change in the number of immigrants and outcomes for the native-born . What Borjas studies , instead , is the change in the immigrant share of the labor force and outcomes for the native-born . Card and Peri argue that this essentially overcorrects for the West Virginia problem . If lots of immigrants move somewhere ( to , say , Texas ) , and that increases the demand for native-born workers , thus inducing a lot of native-born Americans to also move there , Borjas would say that doesn \u2019 t count as an example of immigration boosting the economy , because the immigrant share of the local labor force didn \u2019 t rise . If you switch to measuring the raw number of immigrants , the bad labor market outcomes he finds disappears .\nAs Noah Smith writes , \u201c the weight of evidence is against Borjas , and many of his methods also tend to look a bit shaky when subjected to careful scrutiny. \u201d If you have some freestanding non-economic reason to want to limit immigration and want to convince yourself it \u2019 s also a good idea in economic terms , those ideas are out there . Similarly , if you \u2019 re a politician who \u2019 s convinced your constituents want you to vote for fewer immigrants and are casting around for a good reason , Borjas is there for you to cite . But his findings are outliers based on an unusual methodology .\nWages are easy to measure , so many studies focus on them for the sake of methodological simplicity . But there is more to life than cash wages , and studies show that immigration has significant indirect benefits .\nOne example is what Michael Clemens , Ethan Lewis , and Hannah Postel found when they looked at what happened in the 1960s when the United States decided to eliminate Mexican guest workers from America \u2019 s agricultural labor force . These guest workers , called braceros , were heavily present in some states , like Texas and California . Other states , such as Georgia and Wisconsin , had a few braceros . Some had no braceros whatsoever . By comparing wage trends in high-exposure , low-exposure , and no-exposure states , they were able to show that kicking out the guest workers had no real impact on farm wages .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean the laws of supply and demand were magically repealed . It means that landowners changed their strategy . For some crops , like tomatoes and sugar beets , producers were able to switch to more mechanical harvesting techniques \u2014 compromising on quality in the case of tomatoes .\nFor other crops \u2014 including asparagus , fresh strawberries , lettuce , celery , and cucumbers , for example \u2014 mechanization techniques were not available , and production simply fell . Wages did not rise ; instead , Americans learned to live with reduced produce variety .\nThis same variety impact exists on the retail and service side of the economy as well . If you visit a place with few immigrants from Mexico \u2014 France or Fargo or what have you \u2014 you don \u2019 t find that taqueria workers are earning vastly more money than their counterparts in Texas . You find that there are few good places to buy tacos .\nThis isn \u2019 t the end of the world , any more than an asparagus shortage would be an acute social crisis , but that \u2019 s exactly why eliminating foreign-born workers doesn \u2019 t boost wages . People simply make do without the variety that immigrants provide .\nPeri and co-author Gianmarco Ottaviano find that the value of increased cultural diversity of this sort can be partially measured through higher housing values in more diverse cities \u2014 people are willing to pay more for the amenity value of ethnic food \u2014 but will miss the extent to which a nationally rising tide lifts all boats .\nA common rhetorical move in the United States is to argue that the problem with the current American system is that green card issuance depends too heavily on having relatives in the United States , rather than on having a job offer or labor market skills . The Trump administration has taken to calling the alternative , which they feel to be in place in Canada and Australia , a \u201c merit-based \u201d system .\nNick Adams new book , Green Card Warrior , is a must read . The merit-based system is the way to go . Canada , Australia ! @ foxandfriends \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 3 , 2017\nThis \u201c merit \u201d language is , for starters , an incredibly offensive and reductive way to think about human beings . Indeed , one suspects that Trumpniks would be the first to object if I were to refer to the Republican Party \u2019 s base of whites without college degrees as lacking \u201c merit . \u201d\nWhat is true is that since people with more degrees \u2014 and especially people with degrees in technical subjects \u2014 earn above-average incomes , highly educated immigrants have a more positive budgetary impact than less educated ones . Altering American immigration policy to put more weight on in-demand skills , educational credentials , and ability to either attract above-market salaries or work in a field where expanding the size of the workforce is deemed socially desirable is a perfectly reasonable proposal .\nAt the same time , it would be a mistake to see this as the genuine core of the contemporary immigration debate .\nBack in 2013 , for example , Rep. Darryl Issa ( R-CA ) introduced the SKILLS Act , which would have limited the existing \u201c diversity visa \u201d program and replaced it with a skills-based program that would have increased the total number of immigrants in the United States . The Congressional Budget Office score confirms that shifting policy in this direction is a fiscal winner , but no Democrats would support SKILLS , viewing it as a poison bill designed to undermine the then-ongoing quest for comprehensive immigration reform . More tellingly , it only had 22 co-sponsors in the House , and even though it passed the Judiciary Committee , it was never brought to the floor for a vote . It was not reintroduced in the next Congress , nor has it been reintroduced this Congress .\nThe Trump administration , meanwhile , is already acting to curtail guest worker visas for skilled technical workers . Steve Bannon , who appears to be the administration \u2019 s point man on immigration issues , has long been suspicious of economically successful immigrants .\nWhat \u2019 s more , whether or not you see a strong case for switching to a more skills-oriented system , America \u2019 s current immigration laws already make it so that newly arrived immigrants are better-educated than the native-born population .\nLast but by no means least , even \u201c unskilled \u201d immigrants serve to increase the supply of skilled labor through their work in the household sector . Patricia Cortes and Jose Tessada find that cities with larger numbers of less skilled immigrants see higher labor force participation and more hours worked by highly skilled women , who hire more hours per week of maids , nannies , and cooks , allowing them to shift their labor efforts out of unpaid home production and into market work . Immigrants who do work mowing lawns , cleaning pools , and other household activities likely have a similar impact .\nIt bears mentioning , even in an \u201c America first \u201d mood , that immigration carries extremely large benefits for immigrants themselves .\nIndian computer programmers who come to the United States on H-1B guest worker visas , for example , see their earnings increase by a factor of five or six . That \u2019 s an extraordinarily large benefit , and yet in the broader picture of immigration economics it \u2019 s a relatively small one . Computer programming work , after all , can in principle be done remotely . Clemens finds that less skilled workers can obtain wage gains of tenfold or more by moving from poor countries to rich ones .\nThese enormous benefits matter in part because foreigners are still human beings whose lives and interests ought to count for something in our calculus .\nIn other words , to the extent that there is reason to believe restricting the ability of some class of immigrants to enter the United States will have some benefits to some set of native-born workers , it \u2019 s worth considering that keeping a potential worker out of the United States is an extraordinarily costly measure to take . Something much milder , like making employers of foreign-born workers pay an extra payroll tax , with the money used to plug the Social Security funding gap or subsidize low-paid workers \u2019 wages , would leave absolutely everyone better off .\nThe benefits to immigrants are also relevant because the economy is not a fixed pie . If an Indian-born computer programmer moves to the United States and quintuples his income , he is much more likely to buy an American-made car than if he were stuck in Asia earning a dramatically lower income . Growing exports of American manufactured goods has become an obsession , but increasing domestic sales has the exact same benefits . Bringing the customers to our shores makes them easier to reach , and massively increasing their incomes massively increases their ability to buy things .\nLast but by no means least , while it \u2019 s certainly true that Americans care about the average well-being of American citizens , we also care about something else \u2014 greatness , for lack of a better word .\nIn per capita income terms , the United States has , by most measures , been overtaken by Switzerland . The Netherlands is relatively close behind , and when you consider inequality and quality of public services , the typical Dutch person may well enjoy a higher standard of living than the typical American . This kind of thing matters . But at the same time , there is a reason that when Americans feel anxiety about national decline , they tend to think of China and not Switzerland . The Netherlands is a great place to live , but it hasn \u2019 t been a great nation since the early 17th century .\nIf Americans had listened to the counsel of the Know-Nothing movement in the 1850s and drastically curtailed immigration from outside of Protestant Europe , it would probably still be a rich country today . But it would be a very different kind of rich country from the one we know \u2014 one with fewer , smaller cities mainly focused on exporting agricultural goods and other natural resources to the wider world . A place more like Canada or a supersize version of New Zealand , rather than an industrial and technological powerhouse that intervened decisively in two world wars and anchored a coalition of liberal states to defeat communism .\nGoing forward , demographers forecast that immigration \u2014 both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise \u2014 is the only reason America \u2019 s working-age population isn \u2019 t declining . This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants \u2019 work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans \u2019 childbearing as well .\nA declining working-age population , seen already in Japan and some southern European countries , poses some serious challenges to a national economy . It tends to push interest rates down to an incredibly low level , making it difficult for central banks to respond to a recession . It also makes it more difficult to sustain public sector retirement programs and elder care more generally .\nThere are some offsetting upsides ( less strain on transportation infrastructure , for example ) , and , like anything else , the problems are solvable . Fundamentally , however , an America that is shrinking is a country that is going to be a lesser force in the world than an America that is growing . It \u2019 s true , of course , that an America that continues to be open to immigrants will be a progressively less white and less Christian country over time . That \u2019 s a threatening prospect to many white Christian Americans , who implicitly identify the country in ethnic and sectarian terms . But America \u2019 s formal self-definition has never been in those terms .\nAnd for those who believe in the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the value of America \u2019 s ideals , accepting a future of decline and retreat in the name of ethnic purity should be unacceptable . That the more homogeneous America will be not just smaller and weaker but also poorer on a per capita basis only underscores what folly it would be to embrace the narrow vision . That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores \u2014 and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so \u2014 is an enormous source of national strength .",

The good news is that those kids grow up to be second-generation adults who \u201ccontribute the most of any generation to the bottom line of state balance sheets.\u201d\n\nThe bigger picture is that the long-run structure of the American welfare state, which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly, requires a growing population and economy. Immigrants contribute to both goals, directly through their presence in the country and indirectly by raising children. Indeed, it\u2019s striking that even an immigration skeptic like George Borjas concedes that immigrants grow the economy and do not personally obtain 100 percent of the benefits of that growth \u2014 meaning their presence increases the overall level of resources available to the native population.\n\nImmigrants commit crimes at a lower rate\n\nImmigrants may build American prosperity, but there\u2019s more to life than economics. For Trump, the central mode of anti-immigrant rhetoric has always been a more visceral fear of violence, from his initial warning of an incoming flood of Mexican rapists to the various efforts to limit Muslims\u2019 ability to travel to the United States. He\u2019s even issued an executive order mandating the creation of a new federal bureaucracy, VOICE, with the specific mission of publicizing crimes committed by immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests,\u201d he told a joint session of Congress.\n\nTo the extent that you want to whip people into an anti-immigrant fervor, it\u2019s a good idea. There are millions of foreign-born people in the United States, and naturally every day some of them are caught committing crimes. Indeed, because immigrants are younger on average than native-born Americans, they commit a somewhat disproportionate share of crime.\n\nBut as Bianca Bersani of the University of Massachusetts has shown, on a year-by-year basis, young immigrants are much less likely to be involved in criminal activity. Indeed, the great trajectory of immigration and crime is that second-generation youth \u2014 kids whose parents were born abroad \u2014 largely assimilate to US behavior norms rather than maintaining the better behavior of their foreign-born parents.\n\n\u201cBorn and socialized in the U.S. mainstream,\u201d Bersani writes, \u201csecond-generation immigrants are simply native-born youth.\u201d\n\nThere is a very real social problem of youth crime in the United States \u2014 especially because the widespread availability of guns makes American crime much deadlier than crime in Europe or Asia \u2014 but immigrants contribute to it only in the sense that they add to the overall population. On a per-person basis, immigrants are better-behaved than natives and immigrants\u2019 kids are worse-behaved than their parents because they learn to act more like Americans.\n\nImmigration-skeptical experts are rare and eccentric\n\nNo issue in economics is entirely unanimous, and because immigration is a contentious issue in partisan politics, it sometimes leads the media to overplay the extent of expert disagreement about the economics of immigration. Consequently, the work of George Borjas, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who has produced the bulk of the research dissenting from the optimistic consensus, tends to play an outsize role in the media landscape.\n\nHis work, summarized for an expert audience in his 2014 book Immigration Economics and for a popular audience in his 2016 book We Wanted Workers, is an outlier in both its conclusions and its methodology.\n\nOne big difference, as UC Berkeley\u2019s David Card and UC Davis\u2019s Giovanni Peri point out in their review of Immigration Economics, comes down to the annoying technical question of how you should measure the number of immigrants in a given labor market. A naive way to make the case for immigration would be to do something like note that the list of states with the smallest foreign-born population is led by West Virginia and also includes Mississippi, Kentucky, and Alabama in the bottom 10. Immigrant-heavy states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Massachusetts are much more prosperous.\n\nThe problem here, of course, is that while it\u2019s possible that West Virginia is so poor because no foreigners move there, it\u2019s equally likely that no foreigners move to West Virginia precisely because it\u2019s poor. A reasonable economic study needs to look at change over time, in both the number of immigrants and labor market outcomes for the native-born.\n\nMost researchers do this by studying the correlation between the change in the number of immigrants and outcomes for the native-born. What Borjas studies, instead, is the change in the immigrant share of the labor force and outcomes for the native-born. Card and Peri argue that this essentially overcorrects for the West Virginia problem. If lots of immigrants move somewhere (to, say, Texas), and that increases the demand for native-born workers, thus inducing a lot of native-born Americans to also move there, Borjas would say that doesn\u2019t count as an example of immigration boosting the economy, because the immigrant share of the local labor force didn\u2019t rise. If you switch to measuring the raw number of immigrants, the bad labor market outcomes he finds disappears.\n\nAs Noah Smith writes, \u201cthe weight of evidence is against Borjas, and many of his methods also tend to look a bit shaky when subjected to careful scrutiny.\u201d If you have some freestanding non-economic reason to want to limit immigration and want to convince yourself it\u2019s also a good idea in economic terms, those ideas are out there. Similarly, if you\u2019re a politician who\u2019s convinced your constituents want you to vote for fewer immigrants and are casting around for a good reason, Borjas is there for you to cite. But his findings are outliers based on an unusual methodology.\n\nImmigration enriches culture and expands options\n\nWages are easy to measure, so many studies focus on them for the sake of methodological simplicity. But there is more to life than cash wages, and studies show that immigration has significant indirect benefits.\n\nOne example is what Michael Clemens, Ethan Lewis, and Hannah Postel found when they looked at what happened in the 1960s when the United States decided to eliminate Mexican guest workers from America\u2019s agricultural labor force. These guest workers, called braceros, were heavily present in some states, like Texas and California. Other states, such as Georgia and Wisconsin, had a few braceros. Some had no braceros whatsoever. By comparing wage trends in high-exposure, low-exposure, and no-exposure states, they were able to show that kicking out the guest workers had no real impact on farm wages.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the laws of supply and demand were magically repealed. It means that landowners changed their strategy. For some crops, like tomatoes and sugar beets, producers were able to switch to more mechanical harvesting techniques \u2014 compromising on quality in the case of tomatoes.\n\nFor other crops \u2014 including asparagus, fresh strawberries, lettuce, celery, and cucumbers, for example \u2014 mechanization techniques were not available, and production simply fell. Wages did not rise; instead, Americans learned to live with reduced produce variety.\n\nThis same variety impact exists on the retail and service side of the economy as well. If you visit a place with few immigrants from Mexico \u2014 France or Fargo or what have you \u2014 you don\u2019t find that taqueria workers are earning vastly more money than their counterparts in Texas. You find that there are few good places to buy tacos.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end of the world, any more than an asparagus shortage would be an acute social crisis, but that\u2019s exactly why eliminating foreign-born workers doesn\u2019t boost wages. People simply make do without the variety that immigrants provide.\n\nPeri and co-author Gianmarco Ottaviano find that the value of increased cultural diversity of this sort can be partially measured through higher housing values in more diverse cities \u2014 people are willing to pay more for the amenity value of ethnic food \u2014 but will miss the extent to which a nationally rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nThe debate is about immigrants, not skills\n\nA common rhetorical move in the United States is to argue that the problem with the current American system is that green card issuance depends too heavily on having relatives in the United States, rather than on having a job offer or labor market skills. The Trump administration has taken to calling the alternative, which they feel to be in place in Canada and Australia, a \u201cmerit-based\u201d system.\n\nNick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017\n\nThis \u201cmerit\u201d language is, for starters, an incredibly offensive and reductive way to think about human beings. Indeed, one suspects that Trumpniks would be the first to object if I were to refer to the Republican Party\u2019s base of whites without college degrees as lacking \u201cmerit.\u201d\n\nWhat is true is that since people with more degrees \u2014 and especially people with degrees in technical subjects \u2014 earn above-average incomes, highly educated immigrants have a more positive budgetary impact than less educated ones. Altering American immigration policy to put more weight on in-demand skills, educational credentials, and ability to either attract above-market salaries or work in a field where expanding the size of the workforce is deemed socially desirable is a perfectly reasonable proposal.\n\nAt the same time, it would be a mistake to see this as the genuine core of the contemporary immigration debate.\n\nBack in 2013, for example, Rep. Darryl Issa (R-CA) introduced the SKILLS Act, which would have limited the existing \u201cdiversity visa\u201d program and replaced it with a skills-based program that would have increased the total number of immigrants in the United States. The Congressional Budget Office score confirms that shifting policy in this direction is a fiscal winner, but no Democrats would support SKILLS, viewing it as a poison bill designed to undermine the then-ongoing quest for comprehensive immigration reform. More tellingly, it only had 22 co-sponsors in the House, and even though it passed the Judiciary Committee, it was never brought to the floor for a vote. It was not reintroduced in the next Congress, nor has it been reintroduced this Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, is already acting to curtail guest worker visas for skilled technical workers. Steve Bannon, who appears to be the administration\u2019s point man on immigration issues, has long been suspicious of economically successful immigrants.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, whether or not you see a strong case for switching to a more skills-oriented system, America\u2019s current immigration laws already make it so that newly arrived immigrants are better-educated than the native-born population.\n\nLast but by no means least, even \u201cunskilled\u201d immigrants serve to increase the supply of skilled labor through their work in the household sector. Patricia Cortes and Jose Tessada find that cities with larger numbers of less skilled immigrants see higher labor force participation and more hours worked by highly skilled women, who hire more hours per week of maids, nannies, and cooks, allowing them to shift their labor efforts out of unpaid home production and into market work. Immigrants who do work mowing lawns, cleaning pools, and other household activities likely have a similar impact.\n\nImmigration\u2019s enormous benefits to immigrants is relevant\n\nIt bears mentioning, even in an \u201cAmerica first\u201d mood, that immigration carries extremely large benefits for immigrants themselves.\n\nIndian computer programmers who come to the United States on H-1B guest worker visas, for example, see their earnings increase by a factor of five or six. That\u2019s an extraordinarily large benefit, and yet in the broader picture of immigration economics it\u2019s a relatively small one. Computer programming work, after all, can in principle be done remotely. Clemens finds that less skilled workers can obtain wage gains of tenfold or more by moving from poor countries to rich ones.\n\nThese enormous benefits matter in part because foreigners are still human beings whose lives and interests ought to count for something in our calculus.\n\nIn other words, to the extent that there is reason to believe restricting the ability of some class of immigrants to enter the United States will have some benefits to some set of native-born workers, it\u2019s worth considering that keeping a potential worker out of the United States is an extraordinarily costly measure to take. Something much milder, like making employers of foreign-born workers pay an extra payroll tax, with the money used to plug the Social Security funding gap or subsidize low-paid workers\u2019 wages, would leave absolutely everyone better off.\n\nThe benefits to immigrants are also relevant because the economy is not a fixed pie. If an Indian-born computer programmer moves to the United States and quintuples his income, he is much more likely to buy an American-made car than if he were stuck in Asia earning a dramatically lower income. Growing exports of American manufactured goods has become an obsession, but increasing domestic sales has the exact same benefits. Bringing the customers to our shores makes them easier to reach, and massively increasing their incomes massively increases their ability to buy things.\n\nImmigrants are integral to American greatness\n\nLast but by no means least, while it\u2019s certainly true that Americans care about the average well-being of American citizens, we also care about something else \u2014 greatness, for lack of a better word.\n\nIn per capita income terms, the United States has, by most measures, been overtaken by Switzerland. The Netherlands is relatively close behind, and when you consider inequality and quality of public services, the typical Dutch person may well enjoy a higher standard of living than the typical American. This kind of thing matters. But at the same time, there is a reason that when Americans feel anxiety about national decline, they tend to think of China and not Switzerland. The Netherlands is a great place to live, but it hasn\u2019t been a great nation since the early 17th century.\n\nAggregates matter, in other words.\n\nIf Americans had listened to the counsel of the Know-Nothing movement in the 1850s and drastically curtailed immigration from outside of Protestant Europe, it would probably still be a rich country today. But it would be a very different kind of rich country from the one we know \u2014 one with fewer, smaller cities mainly focused on exporting agricultural goods and other natural resources to the wider world. A place more like Canada or a supersize version of New Zealand, rather than an industrial and technological powerhouse that intervened decisively in two world wars and anchored a coalition of liberal states to defeat communism.\n\nGoing forward, demographers forecast that immigration \u2014 both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise \u2014 is the only reason America\u2019s working-age population isn\u2019t declining. This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants\u2019 work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans\u2019 childbearing as well.\n\nA declining working-age population, seen already in Japan and some southern European countries, poses some serious challenges to a national economy. It tends to push interest rates down to an incredibly low level, making it difficult for central banks to respond to a recession. It also makes it more difficult to sustain public sector retirement programs and elder care more generally.\n\nThere are some offsetting upsides (less strain on transportation infrastructure, for example), and, like anything else, the problems are solvable. Fundamentally, however, an America that is shrinking is a country that is going to be a lesser force in the world than an America that is growing. It\u2019s true, of course, that an America that continues to be open to immigrants will be a progressively less white and less Christian country over time. That\u2019s a threatening prospect to many white Christian Americans, who implicitly identify the country in ethnic and sectarian terms. But America\u2019s formal self-definition has never been in those terms.\n\nAnd for those who believe in the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the value of America\u2019s ideals, accepting a future of decline and retreat in the name of ethnic purity should be unacceptable. That the more homogeneous America will be not just smaller and weaker but also poorer on a per capita basis only underscores what folly it would be to embrace the narrow vision. That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores \u2014 and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so \u2014 is an enormous source of national strength.\n\nIt\u2019s time we started to see it that way.",
