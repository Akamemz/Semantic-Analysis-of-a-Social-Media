Even Within Parties , There 's Big Disagreement\nWomen represent 20 percent of Congress members right now , and Republicans and Democrats differ sharply on why that 's the case , not to mention how big of a problem that is .\nThat in and of itself is perhaps unsurprising , especially at a time when the parties are heavily divided on a wide variety of topics . But a new poll shows that men and women within each party \u2014 and especially among Republicans \u2014 differ heavily on several of these questions .\nNew data from the Pew Research Center shows that Republican and Republican-leaning women are roughly twice as likely ( 44 percent ) as Republican men ( 24 percent ) to say that there are too few women in office , and are also significantly more likely to say that it 's easier for men to get into office .\nThey also differ on the reasons for that \u2014 64 percent of GOP women say women have to do more to prove themselves , more than twice the rate of GOP men ( 28 percent ) .
