    "content": "Laying out an activist , big-spending second-term agenda , President Obama called on Congress in Tuesday night \u2019 s State of the Union address to spend more on job-creation proposals for the middle class and claimed it would not add to the nation \u2019 s huge budget deficits .\nAfter four years of weak economic recovery , Mr. Obama issued a plea for lawmakers to approve more spending on infrastructure , renewable-energy projects and education . He also called for an increase of the federal minimum wage , to $ 9 per hour up from $ 7.25 , saying \u201c in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty . \u201d\n\u201c A growing economy that creates good , middle-class jobs \u2014 that must be the North Star that guides our efforts , \u201d Mr. Obama said in his fourth State of the Union address . \u201c It is our generation \u2019 s task , then , to reignite the true engine of America \u2019 s economic growth \u2014 a rising , thriving middle class . \u201d\nIn a one-hour address that was mainly aimed at his Democratic base , Mr. Obama called for action on climate change , comprehensive immigration reform , voting rights and gun control . But the main thrust of his speech was devoted to proposals to boost the economy through more government spending .\nThe president proposed tens of billions of dollars in new spending , including a $ 50 billion program to fix aging bridges nationwide , $ 15 billion to rebuild communities hard-hit by the housing crisis and a sweeping expansion of early-childhood education services .\nHe argued that all his proposals will be paid for , and they won \u2019 t add to the annual deficit that has been running at more than $ 1 trillion per year for his entire term of office .\n\u201c Nothing I \u2019 m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c It \u2019 s not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth . \u201d\nMr. Obama said his economic proposals are \u201c fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago . \u201d\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich quickly disagreed , predicting on CNN that the \u201c single dime \u201d line would sink his proposals .\n\u201c This is the most pro-government speech since Lyndon Johnson , \u201d he said after the speech , elaborating that Mr. Obama had reversed Democratic President Bill Clinton \u2019 s famous declaration that the \u201c era of big government is over . \u201d\nThe president focused his speech on jobs and the economy , reasserting themes from his campaign and his second inaugural speech . He is advocating higher taxes on wealthier households , such as the tax increase on families earning more than $ 450,000 that he secured Jan. 1 .\nAs he delivered his new agenda , he \u2019 s facing a March 1 deadline with Congress to avoid automatic spending cuts aimed at reducing the deficit . He rejected suggestions from lawmakers of both parties to stave off defense cuts with revenue from domestic programs .\nDeficit reduction was a relatively small part of Mr. Obama \u2019 s comments . The president said he would still accept a theoretical deal with the GOP to cut $ 900 billion in spending over the next decade , coupled with $ 600 billion in new tax revenue from closing loopholes mainly for wealthier taxpayers .\nHe also pledged to trim Medicare spending by reducing taxpayer subsidies to drug companies and by means-testing for wealthier seniors . But the president emphasized that he believes he has already done more than half of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction , by cutting $ 2.5 trillion over the next decade .\n\u201c Most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda , \u201d he said . \u201c But let \u2019 s be clear : deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan . \u201d\nEven before Mr. Obama spoke , many Republican lawmakers were openly skeptical that the economy will improve under his stewardship , given the record of the past four years . Sen. Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee , told party colleagues in a memo that Mr. Obama \u2019 s economic policies have failed .\n\u201c More people are living in poverty , wages are flat , millions have completely exited the labor force , and fraud and abuse remain rampant , \u201d Mr . Sessions said .\nRep. John Kline , Minnesota Republican and chairmanof the House Education and Workforce Committee , said after the speech that Mr. Obama had \u201c outlined a case for more big government . \u201d\n\u201c Instead of focusing on the ingenuity and greatness of the American people , the president repeated the same broken promises that have kept unemployment hovering around 8 percent and hampered economic growth , \u201d Mr. Kline said .\nNot all the Republican reaction was negative \u2014 Sen. John McCain , the Arizona Republican who lost the presidency to Mr. Obama in 2008 , said he thought the president \u2019 s speech was \u201c great . \u201d\nOutgoing Energy Secretary Steven Chu was chosen as the \u201c designated successor \u201d \u2014 the person in the Cabinet who does not attend the State of the Union address so that , in the event a catastrophe stuck the Capitol and government officials were incapacitated , he could take temporary control .\nThe challenges facing Mr. Obama were set long before he walked triumphantly into the packed House chamber . The president is locked in a contentious battle with congressional Republicans over deficit reduction and spending , with mandatory \u201c sequesters \u201d due to take effect March 1 .\nThe sequester , set in place by the 2011 debt deal , will require an $ 85 billion funding cut this year , with much of it coming out of the military and the rest from domestic discretionary spending .\nThere \u2019 s an urgency to the deadline , with the prospect of across-the-board cuts hurting the economy , as it did when the economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012 . But the president is again facing a deeply divided Congress that has rejected consistently his job-growth proposals as too costly and misguided .\nMost Democrats and Republicans want to cancel part or all of the defense cuts , but they disagree on how to do that . Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes , while Republicans say the Jan. 1 tax deal already raised revenue . The Republicans prefer to cut entitlement spending to preserve the military .\n\u201c The president already got the tax increases he wanted on January 1 , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , prior to the president \u2019 s speech . \u201c We \u2019 re done with the tax part of the equation . Republicans have been very clear about the fact that we \u2019 d rather enact smarter spending cuts . But Washington Democrats so far have failed to put forward a serious proposal of their own . \u201d\nSocial initiatives took up a healthy portion of Mr. Obama \u2019 s agenda . On voting rights , the president proposed a nonpartisan commission led by two attorneys who worked on his and Mitt Romney \u2019 s presidential campaigns \u2014 Democrat Bob Bauer and Republican Ben Ginsberg \u2014 to investigate problems with election-day voting .\n\u201c When any Americans \u2014 no matter where they live or what their party \u2014 are denied that right simply because they can \u2019 t wait for five , six , seven hours just to cast their ballot , we are betraying our ideals , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c We can fix this , and we will . The American people demand it . And so does our democracy . \u201d\nRep. Candice Miller , Michigan Republican and chairwoman of the House Administration Committee , reacted negatively to the proposal , saying voting rights is a \u201c state issue . \u201d\n\u201c I do not support the president \u2019 s proposal to appoint yet another national commission to study solutions to the problem of long lines at polling places that seems to be confined to very few states , \u201d she said . \u201c There is not a Washington one-size-fits-all solution that will solve Florida \u2019 s , or any other state \u2019 s , problems . I also am completely opposed to such a commission putting forward mandates to be imposed on state \u2019 s like Michigan that would disrupt our already well-run system of elections . \u201d\nAmong the guests seated in the first lady \u2019 s box for the speech were the parents of a slain Chicago teen , a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , where 20 students and six educators were slain in December , and a Wisconsin police officer who was wounded in a shooting spree in August at a Sikh temple .\nThe president recited a litany of mass shootings in America and demanded that lawmakers allow a vote on proposals for comprehensive background checks , for an assault weapons ban and for a limit on the capacity of gun magazines .\n\u201c Gabby Giffords deserves a vote , \u201d he said , referring to the former congresswoman wounded by a gunman . \u201c The families of Newtown deserve a vote . The families of Aurora deserve a vote . The families of Oak Creek , and Tucson , and Blacksburg , and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence \u2013 they deserve a simple vote . \u201d\nAs he spoke , lawmakers rose to their feet and Democrats raised their voices in a crescendo of approval .\nLawmakers also gave a standing ovation to 102-year-old Miami resident Desiline Victor , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Haiti who stood in line for three hours at a polling place on the first Sunday of early voting in Florida until workers told her to come back later that evening . She was seated in the first lady \u2019 s box .\nFollowing up on his inaugural address , Mr. Obama also devoted a lengthy passage of his speech to his intention to combat climate change , asking Congress to pursue a \u201c bipartisan , market-based solution \u201d and threatening executive action if it did not .\n\u201c It \u2019 s true that no single event makes a trend , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c But the fact is , the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 . Heat waves , droughts , wildfires , and floods \u2014 all are now more frequent and intense . \u201d\nThe president said the U.S. can make \u201c meaningful progress \u201d on the issue while improving the economy . But he also warned of unilateral action , possibly alluding to the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s power , confirmed by federal courts , to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant .\n\u201c If Congress won \u2019 t act soon to protect future generations , I will , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s effort to sell his initiatives to the public began as soon as he left the podium . Around 10 p.m. Tuesday , he took part in an online conference call with supporters from the nonprofit group Organizing for America , a recycled entity from his re-election campaign . OFA official Jon Carson said the president spoke \u201c about his plan for moving the country forward \u201d and how the public can help .\nOn Wednesday , Mr. Obama will embark on a series of road trips to sell his agenda to the public , beginning with an appearance at a manufacturing plant in Asheville , N.C. On Thursday , the president will travel to an early-childhood learning center in Decatur , Ga. On Friday , he will visit his home base of Chicago , scene of hundreds of shooting deaths despite the city \u2019 s strict gun controls .\nTuesday \u2019 s speech was only Mr. Obama \u2019 s fourth \u201c State of the Union \u201d address , because , technically , incoming presidents merely give a speech to Congress . They can not advise on what had happened to the government the previous year .\nThe president \u2019 s day began with the unwelcome news around 2 a.m. that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test , a move that Mr. Obama denounced as a \u201c highly provocative act. \u201d The president said the U.S. and its allies will take unspecified \u201c swift and credible action . \u201d\nAnd Mr. Obama also announced that the U.S. will bring home 34,000 more troops from Afghanistan by this time next year . That plan will reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan by about half , and remain on schedule to end the U.S. combat mission within two years . The two governments are negotiating on the size of a U.S. force to remain in the country after 2014 .",
