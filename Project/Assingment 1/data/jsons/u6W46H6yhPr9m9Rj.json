    "content": "House Speaker John Boehner stepped into the ring with the conservative flank Wednesday , calling their complaints about the newly unveiled budget plan `` ridiculous '' as he teed up a vote on the bill .\nThe speaker was reacting to groups like FreedomWorks which have blasted the budget `` deal '' as a farce that jacks up spending in the short-term in exchange for promises of additional cuts years from now .\nBoehner , trying to keep the complaints at bay long enough to win support for the plan in the House , lashed out at those organizations during a press conference Wednesday . Leaders plan a vote on Thursday and have voiced confidence that the bill will pass .\n`` They 're using our members and they 're using the American people for their own goals . This is ridiculous , '' he said . `` Listen if you 're for more deficit reduction , you 're for this agreement . ''\nBut despite the fanfare surrounding Tuesday 's budget unveiling , there was a steadily growing contingent of advocacy groups and lawmakers claiming the deal should not be approved .\n`` Speaker Boehner 's real problem here is n't with conservative groups like FreedomWorks , it 's with millions of individual Americans who vote Republican because they were told the GOP was the party of small government and fiscal responsibility , '' FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe said in a statement .\nClub for Growth President Chris Chocola , in response to Boehner , cited Republican senators who have come out against the plan . `` We stand with Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Tom Coburn , Rand Paul , members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes '' the deal , he said .\nRanking Senate Budget Committee member Sen. Jeff Sessions also came out against the plan , saying he does n't support numerous parts of the deal and it `` was never formally considered , crafted , or voted upon by the conferees . ''\nIt 's unclear whether the Republican infighting will translate to a problem with getting the votes on the House floor . Many Democrats , for their part , were unhappy the deal does not include an extension of long-term unemployment aid and are trying to get a vote to include it . Many Republicans groused that the tentative deal , while claiming $ 23 billion in net deficit reduction over the next decade , unravels a large chunk of the sequester cuts for the next two years .\nHowever , a number of Republican and Democratic leaders lined up behind the plan , claiming it 's a step in the right direction , eases the indiscriminate cuts of the sequester and -- perhaps most importantly -- sets in place a budget plan for the next two years and lifts the recurring threat of a partial government shutdown .\nLawmakers this time are facing a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a budget plan .\n`` We feel very good at where we are with our members , '' said Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , who was the lead negotiator along with Sen.
