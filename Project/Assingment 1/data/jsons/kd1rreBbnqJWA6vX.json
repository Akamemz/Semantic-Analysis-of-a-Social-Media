''\nMattis separately described Moscow as `` raising grave concerns on several fronts . ''\nHis remarks , including a strong endorsement of the NATO military alliance , are a departure from Trump , who has been accused of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has repeatedly denigrated NATO and other U.S. alliances on the campaign trail under the banner of \u201c America First . \u201d\nTrump has also promised to rip up the 2015 agreement to lift sanctions on Iran in return for the Islamic Republic freezing its nuclear weapons program , a deal that was reached with several nations , including Russia .\nMattis , who retired from the military as a four-star general in 2013 , repeatedly touted the importance of international partnerships during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee .\n\u201c History is clear : nations with strong allies thrive and those without them wither , \u201d Mattis said .\nMattis also said he was a strong supporter of NATO in a lengthy questionnaire he provided to the panel . \u201c NATO is central to our defense , \u201d Mattis said . \u201c I believe the alliance must harness renewed political will to confront and walk back aggressive Russian actions and other threats to the security of its members . \u201d\nHis overall views are almost certain to play well among members of the Senate Armed Services panel , which is made up of some of the biggest defense hawks in both parties \u2014 including a number of senators who are very concerned about Trump \u2019 s disparagement of global alliances and his embrace of Putin .\nMattis \u2019 remarks on Iran , however , will likely frustrate some of the biggest critics of the nuclear pact .\n\u201c I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement \u2014 it 's not a friendship treaty , \u201d Mattis said . \u201c But when America gives her word , we have to live up to it and work with our allies . \u201d\nHere are some other highlights of Mattis \u2019 confirmation hearing testimony :\nThe retired general , a popular pick whose confirmation is all but assured , will still require a waiver from both the Senate and House to get an exception to the legal prohibition on retired military officials serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of uniform for at least seven years .\nMattis , just three years out of uniform , said he recognizes his post would be a civilian role , differing \u201c in essence and in substance from my former role in uniform . \u201d\n\u201c Civilian control of the military is a fundamental tenet of the American military tradition , \u201d Mattis said in his written testimony . \u201c If the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-year requirement , I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions . \u201d\n\u2018 No plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military \u2019\nMattis has won bipartisan praise among the senators who will decide his fate , with key Democrats viewing him as a tested battlefield commander who could temper Trump on human-rights issues like torture .\nBut a number of Democrats said ahead of the hearing they were worried about Mattis \u2019 views on military social issues , particularly women in combat , which he has opposed in the past .\nIn the hearing , Mattis indicated he did not plan to undo the Obama administration \u2019 s 2015 decision to open all combat jobs to women \u2014 though he did not completely close off the possibility .\n\u201c I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military , \u201d Mattis said Thursday . \u201c I \u2019 m coming in with the understanding that I lead the Department of Defense , and if someone brings me a problem I will look at it .
