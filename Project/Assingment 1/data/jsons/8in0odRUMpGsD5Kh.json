It is also a big player in intelligence gathering and counterterrorism .\nThat status gave Mrs. May \u2019 s reference to those issues particular resonance . Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny , speaking on the sidelines of a gathering of Europe \u2019 s center-right politicians in Malta , said everybody there was talking about the link she had apparently laid out between security and future trade ties .\n\u201c The government will say it \u2019 s not a threat , but they \u2019 ve made a point , \u201d Mr. Kenny said .\nMrs. May said she would seek a broad trade and economic deal with the EU \u201c of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it , \u201d one that she said for the first time should include crucial sectors such as financial services and telecommunications .\nThe U.K. government is expected to publish details on Thursday of its plans to convert EU laws and regulations into U.K. law , a move officials say will pave the way for a smooth transition . Once the laws are transposed , politicians will decide how they want to adjust them .\n\u201c Converting EU law into U.K. law , and ending the supremacy of lawmakers in Brussels , is an important step in giving businesses , workers and consumers the certainty they need , \u201d said David Davis , Brexit secretary .\nThe EU \u2019 s trade deal with the U.S. and its recently sealed accord with Canada address some financial service issues , but Mrs. May \u2019 s comments suggest the U.K. government is looking for a much more sweeping arrangement that could allow U.K.-based financial firms to continue to provide services to European customers .\nEuropean capitals are hoping to persuade U.K.-based financial service firms to shift jobs to the continent , even as officials acknowledge that EU businesses will continue to rely on financing from the City of London .\nThe triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty , which governs EU law , opens a two-year window for Britain to negotiate the terms of its exit from the bloc , unraveling 44 years of ties .\nManaging Britain \u2019 s exit will be a major measure of the Mrs. May \u2019 s leadership and diplomatic skills , as she has only a slim majority in Parliament . The negotiations will also test the unity of the remaining 27 nations of the EU , which have so far largely held together by sticking to their promise not to strike separate deals with London before talks begin .\nMr. Tusk , in Brussels , expressed regret about Britain \u2019 s decision to leave , saying of the coming talks that \u201c in essence , this is about damage control . \u201d\n\u201c There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day , neither in Brussels nor in London , \u201d he said . \u201c We already miss you . \u201d\nThe negotiations are expected to be tough . Early indications are that Britain and the EU are far apart . Mrs. May has said Britain would pursue a clean break from the EU , regaining control over immigration , leaving the jurisdiction of the bloc \u2019 s courts and exiting its common market .\nBritish officials said they want to negotiate the best deal they can for trade with the EU . European leaders have said they don \u2019 t want to punish the U.K. for leaving , but won \u2019 t grant Britain a better deal outside the club than it had in it .\nMrs. May said she accepted warnings that Britain can \u2019 t choose what it would like to keep from the EU while dropping obligations it doesn \u2019 t want .\n\u201c We understand that there will be consequences for the U.K. of leaving the EU , \u201d she said . \u201c We know that U.K. companies that trade with the EU will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part , just as we do in other overseas markets . We accept that . \u201d\nOne of the first\u2014and likely most contentious\u2014issues in the negotiations is set to be how much the U.K. will have to pay to exit from the bloc .\nSome U.K. officials have said the country shouldn \u2019 t have to pay anything after a referendum campaign in which the British contribution to the bloc was a significant pro-Brexit argument . EU officials say the bill , which would include payments for programs the U.K. committed to before it voted to leave , could be as high as \u20ac55 billion ( $ 54 billion ) to \u20ac60 billion .\nIn her letter Wednesday , Mrs. May hinted that the U.K. would be willing to make some payments . The two sides , she wrote , \u201c will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the U.K. \u2019 s rights and obligations as a departing member state , in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom \u2019 s continuing partnership with the EU . \u201d\nMrs. May told Mr. Tusk the U.K. wants talks on the future relationship to take place alongside negotiations over the terms of its exit . She said she hoped to complete them within two years , while acknowledging that was a challenging timetable .\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said divorce negotiations have to be concluded before talks about future relations can begin . \u201c During the negotiations , we first have to clarify how to untie these links in an orderly way , \u201d she said on Wednesday . \u201c Only then\u2014but hopefully soon\u2014can we address questions about our future relations . \u201d\nMrs. May also said one of her priorities is to strike an early agreement on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and U.K. citizens living in other parts of Europe . The EU has said talks on that issue alone would likely take at least several months .\nA country like Spain , which hosts a large community of elderly British expatriates , might look to limit the scope of future rights and benefits since it could end up resulting in a net cost for the government .
