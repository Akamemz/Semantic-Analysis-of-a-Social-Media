    "content": "One day , back in the late 50s , my father , flanked by my brother , was standing in the hall of the Capitol with a congressman and some of his staffers .\nMike Dowd , a strapping Catholic Washington D.C. police inspector born in County Clare , Ireland , was in charge of Senate security for 13 years and Michael , my oldest brother , was working his way through law school as a Capitol elevator operator .\nThe congressman began to tell a dirty joke . My dad raised his hand .\n\u201c Stop , \u201d Mike Dowd said . \u201c Go say a Hail Mary. \u201d Then he sauntered away with Michael in tow .\nYoung Michael was a brainiac , with a Google memory before Google , who rarely lavished praise . But he always recounted that story about my dad with great pride .\nSomeone should have told Donald J. Trump long ago to go say a Hail Mary when he started to say something smutty . Maybe then , the cheesy and cheddar-colored billionaire wouldn \u2019 t be reaping the whirlwind tonight , figuring out how to throw a Hail Mary pass to save his teetering candidacy , shore up his cowering party and salvage whatever is left of his brand .\n\u201c Everything Trump touches dies , \u201d Rick Wilson , a Republican consultant , told The Washington Post \u2019 s Phil Rucker .\nTrump has had an apocalyptic effect on the nation . Those who know him well describe being friends with \u201c a hurricane. \u201d And for 16 months , the Republican Party , Trump \u2019 s ever-shifting cast of advisers and at times , the media , have all been handcuffed to this hurricane .\nHe has changed everything about politics . There were some good things in the beginning , like when he turned over the golden apple cart of political hucksters , showing that you can make it without a lot of high-priced mercenaries and a couple hundred million dollars worth of negative ads .\nBut then came the avalanche of dreadful things : the bigotry , the xenophobia , the misogyny , the violence at rallies , the profane language , the vile epithets and uncontrollable vindictiveness . ( I feel I got off easy being labeled merely a wacky , crazy , neurotic dope by Trump . )\nThis weekend was the Republican Party \u2019 s version of \u201c Murder on the Orient Express : \u201d a passel of lawmakers and other G.O.P . luminaries who have been insulted , belittled and politically undermined by Trump joining with lethal coordination to stick the knife in their indefensible nominee \u2014 death by a thousand cuts and defections .\nBut it will be hard for Republicans who waited this long to justify their cowardice in not distancing themselves sooner . The magnitude of the Republican Party \u2019 s \u201c disgrace \u201d is almost impossible to articulate , Steve Schmidt , who helped run John McCain \u2019 s campaign in 2008 , said on \u201c Meet the Press \u201d today .\nThis year with Trump , he said , we have seen \u201c these candidates who have repeatedly put their party ahead of their country , denying what is so obviously clear to anybody who \u2019 s watching about his complete and total , manifest unfitness for this office . \u201d\nAs repulsive as the new tape is , with Trump giving Billy Bush his philosophy of pawing and pouncing , it is not a shocker .\nTrump has always talked like a guy in a steam bath at the Sands Casino in Vegas in 1959 . And he has always been surrounded by seamy enablers like Billy Bush , who insisted the poor soap opera actress meeting their bus give Trump a hug , even though Trump didn \u2019 t seem to want one any more than she did .\nTrump \u2019 s defense , given to Robert Costa in Saturday \u2019 s Washington Post , sounded like it could have been a wintry Sinatra lament : \u201c I \u2019 ve been here before , I \u2019 ll tell ya , in life . I understand life and how you make it through . You go through things . I \u2019 ve been through many . It \u2019 s called life .
