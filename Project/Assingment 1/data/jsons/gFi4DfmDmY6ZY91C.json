He has been out of the state for 137 days , or 40 percent of the time , since his second inauguration in January . If he starts a campaign for the presidency early in 2015 , it would ensure a tenure spent more on national pursuits than on , say , Pinelands preservation or taking on public employees over pension reform \u2014 the issue that brought him all the national attention in the first place .",
