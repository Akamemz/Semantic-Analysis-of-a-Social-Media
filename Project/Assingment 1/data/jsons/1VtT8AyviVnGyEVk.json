    "content": "( CNN ) The State Department announced Friday that it will not release 22 emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because they contain `` top secret '' information , the highest level of government classification .\nThe decision , coming three days before the Iowa caucuses , could provide fodder for Clinton 's political opponents , especially Republicans , who are likely to make note of the emails ' `` top secret '' designation . Clinton 's email use has haunted her on the campaign trail since it became public early last year that she maintained a private server while leading the State Department .\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said the documents , totaling 37 pages , were not marked classified at the time they were sent , but are being upgraded at the request of the Intelligence Community because they contain sensitive information .\nBut , Kirby said , a separate review by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and Research is being held into whether the information in the emails was classified at the time they were sent and received . He would not say when the review began or how long it would go , and acknowledged it 's possible there could be classified emails that were n't marked as such .\n`` It 's certainly possible that for any number of reasons , traffic can be sent that 's not marked appropriately for its classification . That is certainly possible , '' Kirby said .\nBut he added that he was n't going to make any judgments about this particular case .\n`` All I can tell you definitively is it was n't marked classified at the time it was sent , '' Kirby said .\nA senior State Department official said the review `` began very recently '' and was initiated by the State Department , but the official would n't say what prompted it .\nA spokesperson for the Intelligence Community 's inspector general declined to comment .\nKirby also said 18 emails , comprised of eight email chains between Clinton and President Barack Obama , are being `` withheld in full '' to `` protect the President 's ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel . '' But , Kirby said , they `` have not been determined to be classified '' and said they will `` ultimately be released in accordance with the Presidential records act . ''\nClinton did not mention the email controversy during campaign events Friday . But in an interview with KCRG in Dubuque , Iowa , Clinton maintained that she `` never emailed anything that was considered to be classified '' and asked for the emails to be released .\n`` I 'd love for people to see what I did and I hope that will happen , '' she said .\nBrian Fallon , a spokesman for Clinton 's campaign , said in a statement that Friday 's announcement was a case of `` over-classification run amok '' and reiterated Clinton 's position that the emails be made public .\nBut later Friday , Fallon declined to say whether Clinton would ask Obama to declassify the emails when pressed by CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on `` The Situation Room . ''\n`` The President easily could declassify all of these emails if she asked him and if he agreed , right ? '' Blitzer asked .\n`` I 'd really be surprised if this has risen to the President 's level , '' Fallon replied . `` Because , again , this a mundane matter of fulfilling a FOIA request . ''\nAsked Friday if he had `` certainty and confidence '' that Clinton will not be indicted over the email controversy , White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said any decision to prosecute Clinton would rest with the Justice Department .\n`` That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors , '' Earnest said . `` But again , based on what we know from the Department of Justice , it does not seem to be headed in that direction . ''\nThe State Department released more than 900 of Clinton 's emails Friday -- 242 of which received classification upgrades : 11 to `` secret '' and 209 more to `` confidential , '' along with the 22 emails containing `` top secret '' information -- but the release fell well behind the judge-imposed timetable for producing all of her emails .\nClinton seeking to confirm with her team that a piece of information , which top aide Jake Sullivan described as proof the new Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications was doing its job , was `` not classified or otherwise inappropriate '' and fit to share with a reporter ;\nEvidence that Clinton actively lobbied on behalf of the Affordable Care Act -- at one point , she emailed Miguel Rodriguez , then the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs , to inform him she 'd spoken and received a `` yes '' from then-Arkansas Rep.
