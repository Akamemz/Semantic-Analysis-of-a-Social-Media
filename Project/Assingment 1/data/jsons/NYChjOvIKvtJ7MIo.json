    "content": "Socially conservative former Alabama chief justice , one of the most controversial US politicians , was removed from state supreme court post twice\nThe former Alabama judge Roy Moore , one of the most controversial figures in Republican politics , is on course to become a US senator \u2013 in spite of opposition from Donald Trump .\nWith 95 % of the vote in on Tuesday night , Moore , the former chief justice of the Alabama supreme court was ahead of appointed incumbent Luther Strange by 55 % to 45 % in the Republican Senate runoff .\nMoore \u2019 s victory comes despite being outspent by a margin of 10-to-1 by Strange , who had been appointed in January to the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions after his confirmation as US attorney general .\nQuick guide Gay bans and praise for Putin : the world according to Roy Moore Show Hide Homosexuality should be illegal In 2005 , Moore said : \u201c Homosexual conduct should be illegal. \u201d In an interview televised on C-Span , Moore added : \u201c It is immoral . It is defined by the law as detestable. \u201d During a debate in September 2017 , he went out of his way to bemoan the fact that \u201c sodomy [ and ] sexual perversion sweep the land \u201d . September 11 attacks as divine punishment In a speech in February , Moore appeared to suggest that the terrorist attacks of September 11 were the result of divine retribution against the United States and prophesized in the Book of Isaiah . In comments first reported by CNN , Moore quoted Isaiah 30:12-13 , saying : \u201c Because you have despised His word and trust in perverseness and oppression , and say thereon ... therefore this iniquity will be to you as a breach ready to fall , swell out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instance. \u201d Moore then noted : \u201c Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon , whose breaking came suddenly at an instance , doesn \u2019 t it ? \u201d He added : \u201c If you think that \u2019 s coincidence , if you go to verse 25 : \u2018 There should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill , rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall. \u2019 '' Praise for Putin In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in August , Moore praised Putin for his views on gay rights . \u201c Maybe Putin is right . Maybe he \u2019 s more akin to me than I know. \u201d The comments came after Moore suggested the United States could be described as \u201c the focus of evil in the world \u201d because \u201c we promote a lot of bad things \u201d . Moore specifically named gay marriage as one of those \u201c bad things \u201d .\n'Reds and yellows \u2019 At a rally earlier in September , Moore talked about \u201c reds and yellows fighting \u201d while discussing racial division in the United States . Moore justified this on Twitter by citing lyrics from the song Jesus Loves the Little Children . He wrote \u201c Red , yellow , black and white they are precious in His sight . Jesus loves the little children of the world . This is the Gospel. \u201d Tracking livestock is communism In 2006 , Moore condemned a proposal for a national ID system for animals as \u201c more identifiable with communism than free enterprise \u201d . The proposal received attention after a cow in Alabama had been diagnosed with mad cow disease . Moore , who was then running for governor , was skeptical that the outbreak was real . Instead , Moore suggested it was a ruse intended to promote the tracking system .\nMoore was previously twice removed as Alabama \u2019 s chief justice , first for refusing to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments that he installed in the state courthouse and more recently for refusing to implement the US supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage .\nThe result comes as a major blow to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , who had strongly backed Strange . A Super Pac closely linked to McConnell spent over $ 9m on behalf of the incumbent , who was considered a loyal supporter of the Senate GOP leadership .\nHowever , Moore was able to turn McConnell \u2019 s opposition into an asset . In his election eve rally in a barn in Fairhope , Alabama , the loudest applause came when Moore declared : \u201c Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced . \u201d\nMcConnell said in a statement after the result : \u201c Senate Republicans will be as committed to keeping Alabama \u2019 s seat in Republican hands with Roy Moore as we were with Luther Strange. \u201d He also noted that Moore \u201c ran a spirited campaign centered a dissatisfaction with the progress made in Washington \u201d .\nMoore \u2019 s win will be embarrassing for Trump , who had endorsed Strange and appeared with him in a Huntsville rally on Friday . There , Trump expressed ardent support for the man he called \u201c Big Luther \u201d but left plenty of wiggle room as he mused on stage that perhaps he had made a mistake by endorsing Strange . Trump also called Moore a good man and pledged to campaign for him if he won the primary .\nDespite Trump \u2019 s opposition , a number of fervent Trump supporters and former White House staffers had backed Moore . These include former chief strategist Steve Bannon , who told voters at a rally for Moore that \u201c a vote for Judge Roy Moore is a vote for Donald J Trump \u201d , and housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson , who issued a statement of praise for Moore on Friday .\nThe consequences are likely to be harder for McConnell than for Trump . One Bannon ally told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday night that \u201c Mitch McConnell in a Republican primary is now what Nancy Pelosi is in general elections for Democrats \u201d after Moore successfully used Strange \u2019 s support from the Senate majority leader as an attack .\nStrange \u2019 s defeat comes only hours after Tennessee Republican Bob Corker announced his retirement . Corker , a relative moderate within the Republican caucus , had long been considered a target by Bannon \u2019 s populist wing of the GOP . Bannon himself appeared on stage before Moore in Montgomery and celebrated Corker \u2019 s retirement .\nBattle for the soul of the Republican party rages on in Alabama race Read more\n\u201c So you all remembered we talked last night about starting a revolution with Judge Moore \u2019 s victory ? Well , Senator Corker stepped down today and he \u2019 s not going to run for re-election , \u201d announced Bannon to loud applause . He went on to say that this set the stage for more candidates \u201c who follow the model of Judge Moore and do not need to raise money from elites , fat cats , crony capitalists in Washington DC and New York City \u201d to win in the future .\nMoore agreed with Bannon that his victory presaged more primary challenges for Republicans in 2018 . \u201c I think it does , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I agree with that comment and I think Mr Bannon knows that that \u2019 s coming and I think he has a good vision of it . \u201d\nAndy Surabian , the senior advisor to the Great America Alliance , a pro-Trump superPAC that backed Moore , saw the results as a precursor to further challenges to the Republican establishment in the midterms . The operative who helped orchestrate Sarah Palin \u2019 s appearance on behalf of Moore last week , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Moore \u2019 s win was the result of Tea Party-type conservatives making further gains within the Republican party .\n\u201c This is the continuation of what we saw in 2010 , \u201d said Surabian . \u201c In 2010 , we saw Rand Paul and Mike Lee get elected . In 2012 , we saw Ted Cruz get elected . In 2014 , we saw Dave Brat get elected . In 2016 , we saw Donald Trump get elected . Now in 2017 we \u2019 re seeing the rise of Judge Roy Moore . There \u2019 s only going to be more Donald Trumps and Roy Moores coming in 2018 . \u201d\nRand , Lee and Cruz all spoke with Moore on the phone on Tuesday night , with Cruz the first of the three to talk to the newly minted Republican nominee .\nRepublicans quickly embraced Moore . A McConnell-allied superPAC put out a concession statement before the Associated Press had called the race . \u201c While we were honored to have fought hard for Big Luther , Judge Roy Moore won this nomination fair and square and he has our support , as it is vital that we keep this seat in Republican hands , \u201d said the statement from the Senate Leadership Fund .\nTrump himself tweeted : \u201c Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama . Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race . Roy , WIN in Nov ! \u201d The election , however , is in December , as Trump noted in a corrected tweet .\nHe added on Wednesday morning : \u201c Spoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time . Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race . He will help to # MAGA [ make America great again ] ! \u201d\nHis tweets supporting Strange from the last two days disappeared from his account .\nMoore has a long history of controversial remarks . Most recently , in March , he praised the Russian president to a Guardian reporter , saying \u201c maybe Putin is right \u201d on gay marriage . He went on to add of the Russian autocrat : \u201c Maybe he \u2019 s more akin to me than I know. \u201d Moore also warned in a televised debate on Thursday that \u201c sodomy [ and ] sexual perversion sweep the land \u201d . He also brandished a revolver on stage at a campaign rally on Monday night to rebut charges that he was \u201c soft \u201d on gun rights .\nStrange was impeded by scandals of his own . He was appointed by then governor Robert Bentley to the seat despite the fact that Strange , then Alabama \u2019 s attorney general , was investigating him . Bentley has since resigned and pled guilty to two misdemeanors related to his cover-up of an extramarital affair . The result is that Strange has been left under an ethical cloud that his campaign was unable to shake .\nMoore is considered an overwhelming favorite in the deep red state in December \u2019 s general election against Democrat Doug Jones .
