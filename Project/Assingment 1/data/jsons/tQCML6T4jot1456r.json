    "content": "Right-wingers have held an unearned monopoly on gun culture for too long . Whether it \u2019 s in the halls of legislative power or in the comments under \u201c gun bunny \u201d photos on Instagram , there is a prevailing narrative that pegs guns and armed self-defense exclusively to Republicans , racist libertarians , and other generally Constitution-obsessed weirdos . It maintains that those on the left want to take away everyone \u2019 s guns and swathe the entire country in bubble wrap . But I \u2019 m an anarchist , and I call bullshit .\nI \u2019 m of the firm opinion that it \u2019 s time to not only arm the left but challenge the narrative that all leftists are anti-gun . Many are , and that \u2019 s a position I can understand and respect . But there is also a long history of armed community self-defense among the radical left that is often glossed over or forgotten entirely in favor of the Fox News-friendly narrative that all liberals hate guns . That \u2019 s simply not the case \u2014 though as history has proven , the only thing that scares the reactionary right more than the idea of losing their guns is the thought of us having them .\nI grew up with guns , and my familiarity with them is a big part of why l view things the way I do . My family hunts for sustenance , and gun safety was taught to me before I was tall enough to see over my dad \u2019 s workbench . I can understand why people who weren \u2019 t raised around them would view firearms with fear and loathing , but for me , a gun in the hands of someone I trust is a comforting sight , because I know the power it holds .\nWhen I was in Charlottesville , Virginia , protesting the Unite the Right rally in 2017 , the only time I truly felt safe was when members of Redneck Revolt \u2014 a working-class , anti-fascist , anti-racist armed community defense group \u2014 showed up open-carrying and secured the park where a number of us were gathered . The police may have stood by and done nothing as a neo-Nazi murdered one of us , but Redneck Revolt was there to offer protection \u2014 and the fascists steered clear of that park because of it .\nIn Stone Mountain , Georgia , when a group of us marched through the streets to celebrate the cancellation of a Klan rally on February 2 , we were accompanied by local activists with rifles and ARs slung over their shoulders ; the police kept their distance , which was an extraordinary sight for someone used to New York City \u2019 s ultra-aggressive , hyper-militarized NYPD . As the black militant liberation group the Black Panthers showed back in the 1960s , as the Zapatistas showed in the \u2019 90s , and as anarchists in New Orleans showed during the aftermath of Katrina , when cops and other fascists see that they \u2019 re not the only ones packing , the balance of power shifts , and they tend to reconsider their tactics .\nTo be honest , the thought of a world in which the state and their running dogs are the only entities with access to firearms sends a shudder down my spine .\nNot everyone should have access to guns \u2014 domestic abusers , for example , have proven by their actions that they can not be trusted with that kind of responsibility \u2014 and not everyone needs it . No one without a significant amount of training should be handling a firearm at all , which is why I think designated community patrols made up of well-trained , highly trusted individuals who are chosen by and held accountable to said community ( and who do not hold any or less power than anyone else due to their position ) is a far better and more equitable defense model than messy \u201c everyone gets a gun ! \u201d rhetoric .\nI \u2019 m also not interested in creating a parallel cultural universe wherein balaclava-clad \u201c gun bunnies \u201d pose for the \u2019 gram ( I \u2019 d much rather shore up support for Rojava \u2019 s all-women YPG Women \u2019 s Defense Unit ) . I \u2019 m interested in reclaiming the notion of armed self-defense from those who have long used it as a cudgel to repress dissent and terrorize marginalized communities , and emphasizing its potential as a transformative tool toward collective liberation .\nThere is a long history of leftist gun ownership , and a concurrent theme of state repression against it . As author and anarchist scott crow notes , \u201c our current gun control laws disproportionately hobble poor communities and communities of color. \u201d As far as the state is concerned , black people were never meant to own guns at all ; the Second Amendment was intended in part as a means of controlling the enslaved black population and suppressing possible uprisings .\nThat sentiment has proven to have quite a bit of staying power . In 1967 , the Black Panthers staged an armed demonstration on the steps of the California state courthouse and launched an occupation in protest of the Mulford Act , which banned open carry in the state . Said law was written by a Republican Assembly member in response to the Panthers \u2019 cop-watching \u201c police patrols \u201d ; shortly after the protest , state legislators rushed to enact tougher gun control laws , with the full support of Republican President Ronald Reagan and the National Rifle Association .\nIn a stark contrast to its current bloodthirsty propagandizing , the NRA was once a firm proponent of gun control , and was a key component of the passage of 1934 \u2019 s National Firearms Act , which imposed restrictions on machine guns . That began to change in the 1960s ; the NRA continued to support gun control , but its members \u2014 who had begun buying guns more for protection than for hunting \u2014 started to protest . The shift crystallized in 1977 with the ascent of Harlon Carter , a former immigration agent who \u2019 d killed a Mexican teenager in his youth and went on to shape what still fraudulently insists on referring to itself as \u201c the oldest civil rights organization in the country \u201d in his racist image .\nNow the NRA \u2019 s insistence that it fights for the civil rights of legal gun owners rings hollow .
