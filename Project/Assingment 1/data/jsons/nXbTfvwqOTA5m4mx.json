Gary Johnson seized the Libertarian nomination for president at the party \u2019 s national convention this weekend and escaped a hotly contested convention with his hand-picked running mate , former Massachusetts Gov . William Weld .\nThe pair form a political team of two former Republican governors that Johnson declared to be the most formidable third-party ticket in the modern era , one that he promised would thrust Libertarians from the fringe of American politics to \u201c major party status \u201d in a period of widespread mistrust of both the Republican and Democratic parties .\nWith Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton registering as two of the least liked and most mistrusted politicians in the country , many Libertarians see an opening \u2014 and a desire \u2014 for an alternative . And Johnson is the only other candidate likely to appear on the ballot in every state .\nRaising more money is supposed to be the big advantage of selecting Weld , who served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney . \u201c He really likes fundraising and he \u2019 s connected , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c And I really hate fundraising and I \u2019 m not connected . \u201d\nTheir goal , in particular , is to loosen the wallets of the many disaffected and libertarian-leaning Republicans turned off by Trump \u2019 s bombastic rhetoric and shifting policy stands by offering them an alternative of two former Republican governors .\nEd Crane , the co-founder and former president of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute who ran a seven-figure super PAC for Rand Paul , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he planned to revive his Purple PAC group on behalf of Johnson , now that he \u2019 s officially the Libertarian nominee .\n\u201c We could raise millions and I think it \u2019 s a very unique opportunity that you have have two major party candidates who are incredibly unpopular within their own parties , \u201d Crane said . \u201c It won \u2019 t take me long because I \u2019 ve got the numbers of all the major hitters on the libertarian side . \u201d\nEven so , Johnson and Weld now head a deeply divided party , and many of the Libertarian faithful gathered in Orlando were resistant to being dragged anywhere near the mainstream .

In the years since his last presidential run , Johnson served as CEO of a cannabis company , though he has pledged not to use marijuana in the White House , if elected .\nIf all goes according to plan for Johnson in the coming months , he said that he would be in a position to plant a kiss on Trump \u2019 s cheek during a debate this fall , as he has to other rivals in the past .\n\u201c It \u2019 s perfect . No , I \u2019 m serious . It \u2019 s perfect , \u201d Johnson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It is the most disarming gesture . You know , treat the bully with love . \u201d\nJohnson has already landed his lips on an opponent once this cycle ( and he kissed this reporter on the cheek to end an interview after he was asked about his debate-kissing habit ) . At a Libertarian debate earlier this month , Johnson walked over and kissed McAfee as he was being quizzed about his Belizean rap sheet ( it included being a \u201c person of interest \u201d in his neighbor \u2019 s murder and a fugitive ) .\nBut before Johnson , who drew less than 1 percent of the vote as the Libertarian nominee in 2012 , gets his shot at Trump \u2019 s jowls , he \u2019 ll have to actually get on the general election debate stage , a feat no third-party candidate has achieved since 1992 . And to do that he \u2019 ll have to climb to 15 percent in the national polls \u2014 the cutoff set by the presidential debate commission .
