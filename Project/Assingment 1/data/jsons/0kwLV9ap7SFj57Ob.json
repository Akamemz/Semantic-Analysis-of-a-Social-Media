That\u2019s leaving everyone \u2014 lobbyists, executives and lawmakers \u2014 scrambling to game out how a new tax system might look.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at five tax breaks that are vulnerable to being dramatically rewritten \u2014 or scrapped entirely \u2014 and how advocates might fight to save them.\n\n1. The mortgage interest deduction\n\nWhat is it? The government allows homeowners to deduct up to $1 million each year in mortgage interest, including for vacation homes.\n\nHow much does it cost? It\u2019s one of the biggest so-called tax expenditures, which makes it hard to ignore during tax reform when lawmakers are searching for money to pay for lowering rates. The Congressional Budget Office projects the break will cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\n( PHOTOS: 12 Republicans resigned to higher taxes)\n\nWhat might happen? Don\u2019t worry. Virtually no one thinks the deduction \u2014 the motherhood and apple pie of tax breaks \u2014 is going to vanish completely.\n\nBut if tax reform gains traction, the write-off could ultimately look very different than the provision in place today.\n\nCritics have long complained it\u2019s too much of a good thing.

Carried interest\n\nWhat is it? Hedge fund managers, private equity executives and others working on Wall Street pay a special tax rate on profits-based compensation known as carried interest. Instead of paying ordinary income taxes \u2014 which top out at almost 40 percent \u2014 carried interest is taxed as a capital gain, generally at a rate of 20 percent.
