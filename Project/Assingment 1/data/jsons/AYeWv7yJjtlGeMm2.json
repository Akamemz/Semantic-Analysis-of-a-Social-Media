She has solidified her leads in key battleground states and crosses the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House in the NPR Battleground Map with just states where she already has a significant lead .\nIn other words , she could lose all of the toss-up states \u2014 Ohio , Florida , North Carolina , Iowa , Nevada and Georgia , yes , Georgia now \u2014 and still win , as you can see in the map above , 273-174 .\nTrump has battled a litany of bad headlines , including feuding with a family whose Army captain son was killed in Iraq , declined to support ( before endorsing ) key Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan , joked that `` Second Amendment people '' could do something about Clinton , and charged that President Obama ( and Clinton ) `` founded '' ISIS . He even said he wanted a crying baby taken out of a rally \u2014 after a minute earlier saying he liked it . ( He later said he would `` sponsor '' it .
