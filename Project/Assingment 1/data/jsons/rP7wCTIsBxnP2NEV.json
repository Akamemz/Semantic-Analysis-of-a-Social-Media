John Lewis , the civil rights icon who once marched with the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , was blunt : `` We 've got to get out and vote like we never voted before , '' he said , prompting chants from the crowd , '' Vote ! Vote ! Vote ! ''\nHe roused the crowd by imploring them : `` Do n't give up , do n't give in \u2014 keep marching .

One sign , sounding like a mother 's stern rebuke , read in Spanish , \u201c Trump te calmas o te calmo. \u201d Translation : `` Calm down , Trump , or I will calm you down . ''\nAnother sign said , \u201c Melania & Ivanka , stop the child abuse . \u201d\nWhile President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump avoided the chants in Washington , the protests followed them to their weekend retreat in Bedminster , New Jersey .\nOnly a few miles from Trump National Golf Course , more than 100 protesters lined the side of a major New Jersey highway , waving anti-Trump signs and chanting , \u201c Where are the children ! \u201d\nJack Gavin , of West Caldwell , New Jersey , handed out miniature copies of the U.S. Constitution , \u201c Facts Matter \u201d pins and cold drinks .
