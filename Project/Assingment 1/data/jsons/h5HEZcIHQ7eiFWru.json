Sacrifice will be required either way , but analysts say the pain is greater the longer lawmakers wait .\n`` We are unwilling to cover those costs right now and therefore we 're saying to our kids and grandkids -- we do n't want to pay for it . We 're going to have you do it , '' said Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .\nJohn Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis agrees . `` Looking to the future , a young person has to realize his taxes are going to increase enormously or the benefits will be cut enormously or we just go broke . ''\nHow much would taxes have to go up to cover promised benefits ?\nThe Congressional Budget Office examined the issue and found young Americans could face staggering tax increases in decades to come .\nThe CBO reported that in order to keep entitlement benefits where they are , taxes would have to increase by 48 percent in 2030 , and by a whopping 86 percent in 2050 .\nThat would drive the top rate to more than 73 percent , the highest since 1980 .\nCorporate rates would also have to increase from 35 to 65 percent .\nCharles Blahous , a trustee of Social Security and Medicare , said `` it 's clear you do have to make some type of explicit tax increase , if you do n't change the benefits of those programs specifically . ''\nThat is why the CBO wrote that without those additional revenues , the cost of entitlements `` will increase federal debt to unsupportable levels . ''\nAdvocates for entitlement programs , however , say Americans reject any changes to benefits .\nAlex Lawson , of `` Social Security Works , '' said `` we represent the view that 's held by the vast majority of Americans , independents , Republicans , Democrats .
