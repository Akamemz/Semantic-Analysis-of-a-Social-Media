His actions really constitute an impeachment inquiry . I think the Congress should investigate it , everything that \u2019 s gone on . But we \u2019 ve got too much to do for people today to let Trump tie up government the last two years of his term , \u2019 \u201d said Devine .\nAdvisers to Biden caused a buzz in March when they floated the idea that he could pick Stacey Abrams as his running mate before even entering the race .\nAbrams , the former Georgia state House Democratic leader who last year unsuccessfully ran for governor in the Peach State , knocked the idea down , saying \u201c you don \u2019 t run for second place \u201d and suggesting she could run for president herself .\nBut it hasn \u2019 t killed the idea that Biden could pull a surprise by seeking to pick a running mate early as a way of casting his campaign as a unity ticket .\nPicking an African American or female running mate early could also help Biden with voters not keen on backing a white man who would be 78 when entering the Oval Office .\nBut some Democratic strategists warn such a play could backfire .\nSteve Jarding , a Democratic strategist who ran the leadership PACs of past presidential hopefuls such as former Sens .

Candidates such as Warren have tried to build their grass-roots credentials by eschewing wealthy donors .\nBiden , however , faces real questions about his grass-roots fundraising ability .\nHe may need to depend on large donors .

But what about super PACs ?\nBiden said he counseled Sanders ahead of the 2016 election to shun super PACs , warning that their support could erode his ability to appeal to working-class voters .\n\u201c I sat with Bernie , \u201d Biden told PBS \u2019 s Judy Woodruff last year . \u201c I \u2019 m the guy that told him you shouldn \u2019 t accept any money from a super PAC , because people can \u2019 t possibly trust you . How will a middle-class guy accept [ you ] if you accept money ? \u201d\nDevine , who worked on the 2016 Democratic primary in which super PAC-funded attacks became an issue , said Biden should stay away from them in the primary but reserve the right to accept their help in the general election against Trump .\n\u201c In the Democratic primary , for him to use super PACs to advance his candidacy I think would be a real liability , \u201d he said . \u201c However , in a general election against Trump he should be clear that he isn \u2019 t going to unilaterally disarm . \u201d\nA major Democratic donor who requested anonymity to discuss Biden said , \u201c This is definitely going to be a big test for him . \u201d\n\u201c Does he have what it takes to compete with folks who are much better at fundraising than he is and can he attract small dollar donors , because that 's one of the best indicators of enthusiasm and I 'm not sure there 's a ton of enthusiasm for him compared to other candidates , \u201d the source said .\nDemocratic strategists say the allegations that Biden inappropriately touched or invaded the space of several women are not behind him .\nBiden must figure out what else he needs to do to address what could become a simmering issue with women voters .\nBiden addressed the complaints in a video posted on social media in which he tried to defend his touchy-feely tendencies by arguing that \u201c in my career , I \u2019 ve always tried to make a human connection \u201d and then promised to \u201c be much more mindful . \u201d\nBut the gesture of contrition was undermined , some critics say , by a joke he later made during a labor rally when he quipped that he had permission to put his arm around a young boy on stage .\nDemocratic strategists and donors say the issue hasn \u2019 t been put to rest .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s something to make light of . I think he has to be serious about it . He has been serious at times and he \u2019 s been less than serious at other times , \u201d said Devine .\n\u201c The way he has to handle it is by recognizing that there \u2019 s an issue there . He did so when he did that video , he said he understood . I think he has to manifest that understanding now , \u201d he added . \u201c I think he should do something about it , which is the way he comports himself or anybody in general . \u201d\nAnother Democratic strategist , Zac Petkanas , predicted \u201c it 's something that he 's going to have to deal with for the rest of the campaign . \u201d\nHe said Biden would be smart to show he \u2019 s taking the allegations more seriously .\n\u201c He certainly needs to stop joking about it to indicate that he takes it seriously and as seriously as a number of the statements he made which drew praise from 'Me Too ' activists , \u201d Petkanas said .\nOne Democratic donor , who requested anonymity to discuss the party front-runner , said Biden will have to field questions about conduct over and over .\n\u201c In the 'Me Too ' movement , this is going to keep rearing it 's ugly head , and he better have a strategy about dealing with it or it 's going to be the equivalent of Hillary 's emails , \u201d the source said .\nBiden served 36 years in the Senate , giving him a long record for opponents to pick at and attack .\nThe highest-profile controversies from Biden \u2019 s Senate career are his handling of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the testimony of Anita Hill Anita Faye HillClinton celebrates first visibly pregnant CEO to be on business magazine cover Anita Hill : I could see myself voting for Biden over Trump Bill Maher : Buttigieg a 'little too young ' to be president MORE , his role in passing the 1994 crime bill and his vote for the Iraq War .\nSen.

Bernie Sanders does too . ''\n\u201c It \u2019 s not just age , it \u2019 s whether your ideas are about the future as well , \u201d he added .\nTrump is the oldest person to ever have been elected , but if Biden , who is 76 , wins the White House , he would set a new record .\nIt \u2019 s a doubt that Sanders , who is 77 , also has to overcome .\nSanders admitted last year that \u201c age is a factor \u201d but argued earlier this year that a candidate shouldn \u2019 t be judged on their color , gender or how old he or she is .\nRodell Mollineau , a Democratic strategist who served as a senior aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidHarry Reid predicts Trump , unlike Clinton , wo n't become more popular because of impeachment Al Franken to host SiriusXM radio show Pressure on Pelosi to impeach Trump grows MORE ( D-Nev. ) , said Biden can dispel concerns about his age by showing energy on the campaign trail .\n\u201c You have to show vitality through your campaign schedule , \u201d he said . \u201c The work you put into your campaign and the work the vice president will put into his campaign should answer that question for folks . ''\nEven so , Mollineau predicted \u201c it \u2019 s not going to stop the media from continuing to ask it or probably some of the other candidates trying to bring it up . \u201d\nHe said the \u201c electorate is kind of split on that , \u201d noting that many senior senators are in their 70s and 80s while at the same time there are young members who are in their 30s and 40s .",

Bernie Sanders does too.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just age, it\u2019s whether your ideas are about the future as well,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump is the oldest person to ever have been elected, but if Biden, who is 76, wins the White House, he would set a new record.\n\nIt\u2019s a doubt that Sanders, who is 77, also has to overcome.\n\nSanders admitted last year that \u201cage is a factor\u201d but argued earlier this year that a candidate shouldn\u2019t be judged on their color, gender or how old he or she is.\n\nRodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidHarry Reid predicts Trump, unlike Clinton, won't become more popular because of impeachment Al Franken to host SiriusXM radio show Pressure on Pelosi to impeach Trump grows MORE (D-Nev.), said Biden can dispel concerns about his age by showing energy on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cYou have to show vitality through your campaign schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work you put into your campaign and the work the vice president will put into his campaign should answer that question for folks.\"\n\nEven so, Mollineau predicted \u201cit\u2019s not going to stop the media from continuing to ask it or probably some of the other candidates trying to bring it up.\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201celectorate is kind of split on that,\u201d noting that many senior senators are in their 70s and 80s while at the same time there are young members who are in their 30s and 40s.\n\nUpdated at 6:10 a.m.",
