Despite some leaders canceling plans to attend due to the outbreak , President Obama made clear last week that the summit would go on .\n`` It is going to be an unprecedented gathering of African leaders , '' Obama said Friday .\nThe high-profile summit in the nation 's capital is meant to tackle issues ranging from food security to Africa 's business climate to terrorism . It follows on Obama 's trip to Africa last summer .\nBut the surging outbreak of Ebola in West Africa raised questions about whether the summit should even go forward . Already , the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone have canceled .\nObama and government health officials , though , emphasized that they could keep to the agenda , with the proper precautions .\nThe government is `` taking the necessary steps domestically to protect the American people , '' an administration official said in the run-up to the summit . `` We have no plans to change the agenda of the summit , but we will obviously adapt as needed and in consultation with our partners , depending on their requirements . ''\nObama noted that those coming from countries `` that have even a marginal risk or an infinitesimal risk of having been exposed in some fashion '' will undergo screening in their country of departure and additional screening in the U.S . So far , the outbreak is concentrated in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .\n`` We feel confident that the procedures that we 've put in place are appropriate , '' he said .\nThomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , likewise voiced confidence in the precautions being taken .\n`` There are 50 million travelers from around the world that come to the U.S. each year that are essential to our economy , to our families , to our communities , '' Frieden told `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` What we can do is put in place sensible screening procedures . ''\nFrom the CDC 's perspective , he said the most important thing is to `` stop problems at the source . ''\nHe said : `` And the source here is in Africa . That 's why we 're surging and putting 50 CDC disease control specialists on the ground in these three countries to help them find , respond to and stop the spread of the disease . ''\nWhile the summit gets underway , a second American stricken with Ebola is expected to be flown to the U.S. for treatment on Tuesday , following a colleague who was admitted over the weekend to Emory University Hospital 's infectious disease unit .\nThere is no cure for Ebola , which causes hemorrhagic fever that kills at least 60 percent of the people it infects in Africa . Ebola spreads through close contact with bodily fluids and blood , meaning it is not spread as easily as airborne influenza or the common cold . Africa 's under-developed health care system and inadequate infection controls make it easier for the Ebola virus to spread and harder to treat .\nMeanwhile , with the D.C. summit , Obama is trying to follow up on his visits to Africa and fulfill longstanding expectations that he would focus on the beleaguered continent .\nObama 's first trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president was an overnight stop in Ghana in 2009 . But it was four years before Obama returned to Africa , a yawning gap that raised questions about the extent of his commitment to continent . Unlike his predecessor George W. Bush , who launched a $ 15 billion program to address HIV and AIDS , Obama seemed to be lacking a signature Africa initiative . And his administration 's focus turned instead to the Arab Spring movement sweeping through the Middle East , a heavily promoted rebalance toward Asia and a slew of pressing security concerns .\nAnalysts say Obama 's second term has brought about a more robust focus on Africa . The president made a three-country trip to the continent last summer and aides say he 's likely to travel there again before the end of his second term . He 's also launched a new `` Power Africa '' initiative that aims to leverage billions in private sector commitments to bring electricity to 20 million households in sub-Saharan Africa .
