Mitt Romney may have exchanged a tactical defeat for a strategic victory in Monday \u2019 s foreign policy debate , losing on points to the president by most accounts but scoring a solid performance that left major pundits declaring he had passed \u201c the commander in chief test \u201d in resounding fashion.CNN \u2019 s flash poll taken immediately after the debate had President Barack Obama winning , 48 to 40 percent . But a host of pundits declared it a strategic win for Romney , who played it conservatively as Obama aggressively attacked his positions , repeatedly insisting to Romney \u201c that \u2019 s not true , \u201d and \u201c you \u2019 ve been over the map. \u201d The major question for Romney going into the debate : Would he establish himself as a trustworthy alternative to Obama in the commander-in-chief \u2019 s role ? \u201c I think Mitt Romney did something very important to his campaign tonight , \u201d former presidential adviser David Gergen told CNN . \u201c He passed the commander-in-chief test.\u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor , foreign-policy expert , and Pulitzer Prize winner Judith Miller concurred. \u201c What would have killed him was a Gaffe-gate , \u201d she said of Romney . \u201c One mistake , one Gerald Ford moment of Poland not being in the Warsaw Pact . And he was not about to let that happen. \u201d Miller was struck by the degree of consensus between the two leaders on a wide range of foreign policy issues . She said that by taking that approach , Romney \u201c reassured people who fear a return to a more aggressive path . People are sick of war , and I think he did that . He reassured people that he is as steady in foreign policy as he did in domestic policy . I think he passed that test. \u201d Similarly , Fox News commentator and \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor Doug Schoen , a Democratic pollster , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 shortly after the debate that Romney succeeded in demonstrating he is presidential \u201c and on an equal footing with President Obama \u201d in the foreign-policy arena.Romney \u2019 s highlight came as he defended America \u2019 s role in maintaining global order . To do that , he said , the nation would have to remain strong , and continue to lead on the international stage. \u201c We have to also stand by our allies , \u201d he said . \u201c I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate . I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of , if you will , disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. \u201c And then of course , \u201d he continued , \u201c with regards to standing for our principles , when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested , the Green Revolution occurred . For the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake .
