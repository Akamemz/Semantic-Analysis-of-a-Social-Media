    "content": "The Joe Biden who has been reaching out to Democratic operatives and would-be donors for a potential 2016 bid isn \u2019 t quite the happy warrior of bygone days .\nMourning the loss of his eldest son Beau , who succumbed to a brain tumor three months ago , and under intense pressure from the presidential hype he \u2019 s helped stoke , Biden is more subdued , grayer and grimly on-task than usual \u2014 this while occupying political center stage for the first time since the promising opening days of his doomed 1988 campaign .\nFor all the breathless reporting on Biden \u2019 s every move and meeting , he is , at core , a 72-year-old man presented with an unexpected , once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at one of the worst times of his life .\nSeveral people Biden has talked to in the past month say he starts off conversations by conceding that \u201c some days are better than others , \u201d mixing recollections of Beau with logistical questions about mounting a state-by-state challenge to a vulnerable yet still formidable Hillary Clinton .\n\u201c He \u2019 s just not himself , \u201d says a longtime friend of Biden \u2019 s . \u201c He \u2019 s sort of all over the place . He \u2019 s engaged but not in that childlike , manic way he usually is . He \u2019 s taking it all in and soaking up information , but he \u2019 s hard to read . And Joe Biden isn \u2019 t usually that hard to read . \u201d\nThat isn \u2019 t to say Biden won \u2019 t decide to run \u2014 he clearly sees Clinton \u2019 s struggles with her email scandal as an opportunity , and no politician in recent history has proven to be as resilient in the face of personal tragedy .\nTo the annoyance of the Clinton campaign , Biden \u2019 s allies have strategically leaked his modest , noncommittal doings to the media , which have given otherwise ho-hum confabs with Elizabeth Warren and President Barack Obama \u2019 s former counsel Bob Bauer bombshell treatment . ( Warren , according to a person with knowledge of the interaction , offered her usual warning against bringing more Wall Street executives into the White House ; the talk with Bauer , an old Biden friend who worked with him closely in the White House , was intended to be an informal , personal check-in session that was leaked against the wishes of the participants . )\nBut reports that the vice president has all but made up his mind to run are simply not true , according to a half-dozen people in his inner circle interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c He \u2019 s not leaning one way or the other , \u201d says one former aide who remains part of the extended Biden political family .\nWhat he has done is accelerated the pace of his deliberations , making personal overtures to Democratic donors \u2014 though Clinton \u2019 s team has yet to suffer any significant defections . So far he \u2019 s attracted a handful of former Obama supporters who have gravitated to a \u201c Draft Biden \u201d startup , including veteran Florida operative Steve Schale and Jon Cooper , a Long Island businessman who was one of Obama \u2019 s top New York fundraisers .\nBut he \u2019 s behaved more like a staffer than a principal \u2014 sounding out potential supporters without striding into the race with a distinct message or specific policy challenge to Clinton .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s going to do , \u201d said Jim Kreindler , a 2008 Biden fundraiser who is encouraging the vice president to run . \u201c Everybody knows it \u2019 s going to be hard to challenge Hillary for money . \u2026 But I think he knows that he needs to be positioned to jump in if she really stumbles . \u201d\nAs he embarks on a fact-finding project most other candidates completed months ago , Biden \u2019 s greatest concern remains his family . He \u2019 s especially worried about his wife , Jill , who was hit hard by the death of 46-year-old Beau , who she raised after Biden \u2019 s first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 .\nBeau urged his father to run for years , but Jill is deeply skeptical of another run , according to people close to Biden ; she re-upped to teach a full-time load of five English classes at Northern Virginia Community College next semester , as first noted by Bloomberg News , not exactly the action of a woman who planned to hit the campaign trail .\nJoe Biden wants to run \u2014 he always has . But that doesn \u2019 t mean he actually will , and those who have spoken with him say he seems far from making a decision . He \u2019 s playing the same wait-and-see game he \u2019 s played for the past 18 months , telling potential backers he \u2019 ll make a decision as late as early October . Since his 2012 reelection , Biden had opted for inaction over action \u2014 he opted not to create a leadership PAC for the 2014 midterms , he balked at forming a presidential super PAC , he didn \u2019 t seriously sound out donors until this summer .\nOn the other hand , his numbers are too good to ignore . Without even being in the race , he consistently polls in double digits \u2014 and narrowly bested Clinton in head-to-head matchups against top Republicans in the key swing states of Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida . Moreover , he \u2019 s regarded as much more trustworthy than the former secretary of state , enjoying a 20-point lead over Clinton in that metric among battleground state voters .\nObama , according to current and former West Wing officials , is more inclined to support Clinton \u2019 s candidacy . Despite her woes , he sees her as a more electable candidate and a more effective keeper of his policy legacy . He \u2019 s done everything but endorse her already , putting his vast fundraising network in the hands of Clinton \u2019 s super PAC allies . Two of Obama \u2019 s top White House aides , John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri , are running Clinton \u2019 s campaign and report regularly to their old West Wing friends \u2014 including the president .\nBut Obama has told people around him to give the vice president \u201c space \u201d to make his decision , and urged his staff not to make Biden feel pressured not to run .\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that the president wouldn \u2019 t rule out making an endorsement in the primaries \u2014 and other West Wing officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Obama has privately expressed a preference for Clinton as his successor , while keeping up the pretense of being undecided in public .

Bernie Sanders , isn \u2019 t in a patient mood . Bill Clinton , according to a person who has spoken with the former president in the past couple of weeks , is \u201c very agitated \u201d by the possibility of a Biden candidacy and incensed at the press hype around a possible bid .\nHillary Clinton , Democrats in her orbit tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 , is less concerned \u2014 and several top Clinton campaign officials have told associates they think a Biden bid would energize what has been a fairly lackluster performance by the candidate thus far .\nEither way , the Clinton campaign is monitoring Biden \u2019 s activities closely \u2014 and Biden \u2019 s small team is acutely sensitive to slights against him , and to the possibility that her operation \u2014 including Correct the Record and other Clinton-friendly outside groups \u2014 would push anti-Biden opposition research to reporters in order to dissuade the vice president from running . \u201c They better not do that , \u201d said a Biden confidant . \u201c That would bring really out his Irish . \u201d\nPeople close to Clinton say their boss wouldn \u2019 t let them push negative information on Biden even if they wanted to \u2014 and it would backfire anyway , considering Biden \u2019 s tragic family circumstances .\nBiden \u2019 s decision will ultimately come down to convincing his family that embarking on one last long-shot campaign is worth the emotional toll , those close to him say . His staff , small as it is , already seems to be on board : Chief of staff Steve Ricchetti , a onetime Clinton aide , has arranged many of Biden \u2019 s recent meetings , and longtime staffer Mike Donilon \u2014 who was close to Beau \u2014 has been the most enthusiastic proponent of a 2016 bid , according to Democrats with knowledge of the situation .\nHunter Biden , the vice president \u2019 s surviving son , is said to be generally supportive of his father \u2019 s wishes , whatever they might be , but not a cheerleader \u2014 Biden \u2019 s sister Val , long his closest political adviser , is equally ambivalent .
