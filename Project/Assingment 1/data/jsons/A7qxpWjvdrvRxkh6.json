    "content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign \u201c conspired or coordinated \u201d with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 elections , according to Attorney General William Barr \u2019 s summary to Congress delivered Sunday .\nBarr \u2019 s four-page letter outlines the \u201c principal conclusions \u201d of the nearly two-year special counsel probe , reiterating that the Russian government sought to interfere in US politics but that the investigation did not establish that Trump associates aided them in their efforts .\nHis summary also took up the other major element of Mueller \u2019 s investigation : whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice . Here , Barr cites language from Mueller \u2019 s report , noting that the special counsel \u2019 s office did not draw a definite conclusion as to whether the president committed a crime , but also that the report \u201c did not exonerate him . \u201d\nBarr adds that since Mueller did not make a determination , both he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have , concluding that the evidence is not \u201c sufficient to establish the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense . \u201d\nThe White House has seized on these conclusions as \u201c total exoneration \u201d \u2014 \u201c No Collusion , No Obstruction , \u201d Trump tweeted . It may not quite be that , though on the whole , Barr \u2019 s summary is favorable to the president and his associates .\nBut Barr \u2019 s preliminary summary letter is not the full Mueller report , which for now remains confidential . Barr \u2019 s outline of the special counsel \u2019 s findings doesn \u2019 t elaborate on why or how investigators came to their conclusions ( or lack thereof ) . Notably , it is also Barr \u2019 s reading \u2014 with the input of Rosenstein , and likely other DOJ officials \u2014 of Mueller \u2019 s conclusions , and , with few exceptions , not Mueller \u2019 s own words .\nThat ambiguity means Barr \u2019 s letter leaves a few questions still unresolved . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop has an explainer on what we learned from Barr \u2019 s letter . But here \u2019 s we can \u2019 t figure out from Barr \u2019 s summary .\n1 ) How long is Mueller \u2019 s report \u2014 and how detailed is it ?\nOkay , this is kind of an obvious one since Barr \u2019 s letter is , by default , a summary of the report \u2019 s \u201c principal conclusions . \u201d\nBarr \u2019 s letter spans four pages , but the attorney general notes that Mueller \u201c issued more than 2,800 subpoenas , executed nearly 500 search warrants , obtained more than 230 orders for communication records , issued almost 50 orders authorizing the use of pen registers , made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence , and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses . \u201d\nThat indicates a very comprehensive probe that spanned continents . Some , maybe a lot , of that information might never be released because it \u2019 s classified for national security reasons or relies on grand jury information .\nBut how Mueller incorporated this evidence into a report , whether he explained where these investigative threads led and ended , will certainly offer a fuller picture of exactly what Barr means when he says that Mueller did not find that \u201c the Trump Campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election . \u201d\nBarr \u2019 s summary says the special counsel \u201c did not find that the Trump campaign , or anything associated with it , conspired or coordinated with the Russian government \u201d in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign , though it makes clear that Russia did meddle , and points to Mueller \u2019 s indictments against the Russian troll farm and Russian military intelligence hackers that targeted Democrats \u2019 emails . ( The special counsel defined coordination as \u201c an agreement \u2014 tacit or expressed \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference . \u201d )\nBut Barr also says Mueller did not establish coordination or conspiracy , \u201c despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign . \u201d\nThe \u201c multiple offers \u201d from \u201c Russian-affiliated \u201d individuals certainly sounds a lot like the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting . It appears that Mueller found that this or other alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials did not rise to the level of criminality , or at least did not meet the definition of \u201c coordination \u201d as the special counsel defined it . But the question is certainly going to be why .\nBarr notes that Mueller examined possible obstruction of justice offenses , much \u201c of which has been the subject of public reporting . \u201d\nSo it \u2019 s not clear if Mueller uncovered anything beyond of what was already known \u2014 from firing FBI Director James Comey to harassing then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation .\nBut on the obstruction matter , Mueller didn \u2019 t draw a definite conclusion \u201c one way or the other \u2014 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction , \u201d Barr says in his summary .\nInstead , for each of the relevant actions investigated , the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \u201c difficult issues \u201d of law and fact concerning whether the President \u2019 s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction . The Special Counsel \u2019 s report states that \u201c while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime , it also does not exonerate him . \u201d\nMueller \u2019 s decision to note that the \u201c report does not exonerate \u201d him is pretty compelling , and is likely a tidbit Democrats will seize upon .\nJustice Department guidelines say that a sitting president can \u2019 t be indicted , and Mueller was likely to be bound by these regulations . That means wrongdoing on the part of the president is inherently a political question , not a legal one \u2014 and that might be why Mueller did not draw definitive answers on this question . Or it might be that the situation truly is murky and Mueller could not prove conduct one way or another .\n4 ) How much of Barr \u2019 s opinion guided the obstruction summary ?\nBarr , in his letter , says that after much consultation , \u201c Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel \u2019 s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense . \u201d\nBarr states that Mueller \u2019 s findings did not appear to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the president committed an obstruction of justice defense . Barr assesses those standards on three pillars , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dara Lind noted :\n1 . There was \u201c obstructive conduct ; 2 . The conduct was related to a prosecution or investigation ; 3 . The conduct was \u201c done with corrupt intent . \u201d\nBarr and Rosenstein apparently agreed that Trump \u2019 s actions didn \u2019 t meet those standards , at least enough to warrant obstruction of justice charges . But they don \u2019 t offer too many details on how they arrived at this decision .\nThe attorney general does note that since Mueller \u2019 s evidence does not establish that Trump was part of an underlying crime , the \u201c absence of such evidence bears upon the President \u2019 s intent \u201d when it comes to obstruction of justice \u2014 which basically means that without collusion , there can be no obstruction .\nBarr says this is not determinative \u2014 meaning it doesn \u2019 t say obstruction offenses can \u2019 t happen \u2014 but it clearly factored into their reasoning . But beyond that , he doesn \u2019 t explain their thought process in detail . And without Mueller \u2019 s underlying findings , it \u2019 s hard to gauge how strong and compelling Barr \u2019 s \u201c no obstruction \u201d conclusion is .\nNo , but it \u2019 s pretty good for the president and his associates \u2014 particularly on the \u201c collusion \u201d question .\nYet it also seems likely that Mueller \u2019 s confidential report is a very carefully written document . The rare segments Barr quotes in his summary use very precise language . For example :\nAs the report states : \u201c [ T ] he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities . \u201d\n\u201c Did not establish \u201d doesn \u2019 t eliminate the possibility that evidence existed of coordination or cooperation \u2014 but it does indicate there wasn \u2019 t enough evidence to bring prosecutions against certain individuals or a draw larger case .\nThe Justice Department typically doesn \u2019 t release damaging information about people if they \u2019 re not charged with any specific crimes , or explain why a matter doesn \u2019 t rise to criminal prosecution . And while it does happen , it \u2019 s done rarely and often under extraordinary circumstances .\nAll of which means the public probably won \u2019 t know the full spate of Mueller \u2019 s findings \u2014 which means some questions might never be answered fully .\n6 ) When , if ever , will the public see the full Mueller report ?\nWho knows ? Maybe never . Barr said his \u201c goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel \u2019 s report as I can consistent with applicable law , regulations , and Departmental policies . \u201d\nThe applicable law , regulations , and departmental policies will be the tricky part . As mentioned above , the DOJ doesn \u2019 t typically release information about people who are not charged with crimes . Mueller also relied on confidential grand jury information , and Barr says he will need to work with Mueller to determine what information needs to be withheld .\nMueller also referred some cases to other federal prosecutors , which means some of his evidence in the final report is used in ongoing investigations and can \u2019 t be released to the public just yet .\nAll of this will likely prevent a full , unedited report from being made public in the immediate future . But Democratic lawmakers are almost certain to battle to get as much of it released as possible .",
