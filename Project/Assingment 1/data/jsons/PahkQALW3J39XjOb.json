Scott Applewhite/AP\n\n\"No substantive progress has been made.\" That's what House Speaker John Boehner had to say Thursday about efforts to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases at year's end.\n\nThe administration's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, met with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle Thursday, looking for an agreement on the hazard Congress and the White House created last year to focus their minds on deficit reduction.\n\nPerhaps the most important sticking point is over income tax rates. The outcome of the negotiations will determine how many Americans will face higher tax rates \u2014 and how much of a hike it will be.\n\nObama's Proposal\n\nPresident Obama has proposed that top tax rates for well-off Americans rise to their levels from before the Bush-era tax cuts. But he wants to keep the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. So income tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000 would remain where they are.\n\nWhat would that mean for you? Well, if you're among the well-off and earn more than those amounts, the money you make above those levels would be taxed at 36 percent and 39.6 percent \u2014 up a few points from where they are taxed now, and exactly where they were during the Clinton administration. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, this change would boost their tax bill a lot.\n\n\"That tax increase would amount to something in the neighborhood of $120,000,\" says Donald Marron, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe center has crunched a lot of numbers related to the tax effects of the fiscal cliff and the various proposals to avoid it.

Tax rates would go up across the board. The Tax Policy Center says about 90 percent of Americans would see their tax bill increase.\n\n\"For a middle-income household, this increase would be around $2,000; for a low-income household, it would be around $400,\" says center co-director Marron.\n\nWhile that's not a pleasant thought, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for everyone would cut deficits significantly, Burman says.\n\n\"We'd raise $2.2 trillion in income tax revenues over the next 10 years and $430 billion in estate tax revenues,\" he says.\n\nThat would cut projected deficits by about 25 percent over the next 10 years \u2014 a much more sizable chunk, but still not enough to solve the deficit problem.\n\nOf course, the shock to the economy of the abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts would likely cause the economy to plunge back into recession.
