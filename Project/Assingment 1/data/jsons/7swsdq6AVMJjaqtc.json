But this time the attack is coming from a Democrat .\nWhile Barack Obama may not share the Nixon pedigree , he and his White House are the closest thing to the Nixon regime of any that we have seen since then -- both in the extent of their paranoia and their willingness to suppress the truth and push the boundaries of law .\nIn my lifetime , in over 40 years in national politics , Mr. Obama is the only president who comes close to rivaling Richard Nixon for fundamental disingenuousness .\nHowever , some things never change , just as Woodward and Bernstein were attacked then by the establishment mainstream media for daring to question a president -- or do a story that they would n't touch -- they are once again attacking Woodward the way they did when he and Carl Bernstein pursued Watergate .\nAs the youngest person on Nixon 's enemies list in 1972 , I am particularly sensitive to a White House where they have utter disregard for trampling on dissent and on the rights of individuals .\nSince Benghazi , when I raised the alarm about a media that was not only willing to blatantly support one political party or one political a candidate but for the first time seemed willing to suppress or ignore the facts and truth as related to a disaster of American foreign policy , my fear has been that we are now on a slippery slope . Almost everything since then has helped to realize that fear . Chuck Hagel , the sequester , Mr. Obama 's speeches -- all of these have revealed a mainstream press that has absolutely decided to wear its bias openly as outriders of the Obama administration . Except for one issue -- when the president refused to allow reporters to cover him and Tiger Woods playing golf together . Now that 's something they can get riled up about .\nWhat this Woodward , White House sequester battle highlights is the crisis in our democracy . Not so much for what it says about Mr. Obama and his administration but for what it says about the establishment press and all the members of my own party .\nDuring Watergate , there were a number of Republicans who were willing to stand against the president of their party in defense of the United States of America .\nSadly , as as Democrat , I must confess , that today there is no Democratic Senator or member of the House who appears to be willing to publicly put the country ahead of Barack Obama 's White House .\nAs important as these other issues are , however , nothing rivals Benghazi .\nDuring the Chuck Hagel confirmation fight , it was revealed that to this day , neither the public nor the Congress know the names of those who were evacuated out of Benghazi . Nor have we ever seen the transcripts of the interviews which were conducted immediately after the event .\nThe White House 's excuse , that this information can not be revealed because of an FBI investigation , is eerily and frighteningly similar to Nixon telling H.R . Haldeman and John Ehrlichman to `` turn off '' the Watergate investigation as it threatened national security .\nSadly , it now appears that Director Mueller and the FBI are willing to serve , once again , as an instrument of cover up for an administration -- this time following a tragedy in which 4 Americans are now dead .\nAs much as I have always admired Bob Woodward and admire now him in the sequester fight and for his willingness to take on the White House , I can not refrain from expressing my disappointment that this man , who did such a service for the country 40 years ago , has essentially taken himself off the boards of the Benghazi fiasco . I wish that if Woodward were to get in a fight , he would do it on an issue that really matters to the safety of the United States .",
