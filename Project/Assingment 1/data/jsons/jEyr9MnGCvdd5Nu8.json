    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Barack Obama faulted his party 's campaign strategy in an interview airing Monday , arguing Democrats suffered stinging electoral losses in last month 's vote because they failed to campaign in hard-hit rural areas .\nTaking partial blame -- and withholding any direct criticism of Hillary Clinton -- Obama said candidates in the future should ignore at their own peril the places Democrats have n't traditionally performed well .\n`` You 've got a situation where they 're not only entire states but also big chunks of states where , if we 're not showing up , if we 're not in there making an argument , then we 're going to lose , '' Obama told NPR . `` And we can lose badly , and that 's what happened in this election . ''\nIn the aftermath of November 's election , some Democrats have accused Clinton of maintaining a relaxed campaign schedule , bypassing states like Wisconsin and Iowa where Obama won in 2012 . Her wins were principally in urban areas and on the coasts , leaving the rust belt and the heartland mostly red .\nObama said Democrats had n't made enough of an attempt to sway voters outside the nation 's population centers . Persistent losses in statewide and local races only illustrate the party 's structural conundrum , he said .\n`` There are clearly failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in exurban areas a sense day-to-day that we 're fighting for them or connected to them , '' he told NPR 's Steve Inskeep . `` Part of the reason it 's important to show up ... is because it then builds trust and it gives you a better sense of how should you talk about issues in a way that feel salient and feel meaningful to people . ''\nObama campaigned exhaustively for Clinton in states like North Carolina , Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania , travel that officials said was dictated by Clinton headquarters and not the White House . In the final stretch , Obama argued for making a stop in Iowa , a state where he campaigned actively during his own bids for office . But Clinton 's team nixed the idea , dispatching him instead to battlegrounds they felt were more in play .\nIn the NPR interview , Obama said Democrats had `` ceded too much territory '' and took some blame for ignoring political strategy during his early days in office .\n`` More work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure , '' he said . `` One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave , and something that I have some ideas about is , how do we do more of that ground-up building ? ''\nObama said he would work with the party once he leaves office to develop those changes , offering advice and scouting talented young politicians to champion and promote .\nIn interviews and press conferences , Obama has now offered extensive thoughts on how Clinton lost in last month 's election , suggesting a mix of electoral miscalculation , Russian meddling , and media mistreatment .\nTrump knew that Russia was seeking to harm his opponent , Obama argued , though stopped short of accusing the Republican of colluding with Moscow .\n`` That the CIA is now assessing , which was it was done purposefully to tilt the election in the direction of a particular candidate , should n't be a surprise to anybody . And in fact is n't a surprise to anybody , '' Obama said . Later he clarified that US intelligence officials are still working to determine a definitive motive for Russian hackers .\nHe said in the interview that Clinton 's policy and diplomatic experience was lost in a sensationalistic political environment -- fueled , he said , by information gleaned from Russian hacks .\n`` In that scrum , in that swirl , you know , Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxieties and fears that some voters have , I think , definitely made a difference , '' he said .\n`` If we do n't , you know , do some hard reflection -- all of us -- on how that happens , then we 're like a body that is already weakened and then becomes more vulnerable to foreign viruses , becomes more vulnerable to manipulation and demagoguery and that 's something that I 'm also going to be thinking a lot about in my afterlife , my post-presidency , '' he went on .",
