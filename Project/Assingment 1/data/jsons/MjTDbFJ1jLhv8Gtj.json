    "content": "Donald Trump said last week he hasn \u2019 t really started campaigning in the general election . It shows in his poll numbers .\nAfter weeks of blistering news coverage , the latest round of national and battleground-state polling underscores the hole in which Trump now finds himself : trailing Hillary Clinton by a significant margin with fewer than 100 days remaining until early voting begins in the key swing states of Ohio and Iowa .\nTwo new , major national polls released Sunday morning \u2014 surveys from ABC News/Washington Post and NBC News/Wall Street Journal \u2014 differ to some degree , but both are consistent with the broader trend : Clinton holds a reliable lead over Trump , an advantage that occasionally swells to double digits .\nTrump now trails Clinton by 6.3 points in the latest RealClearPolitics polling average , and by 6.6 points in the HuffPost Pollster model . In the key states in the Electoral College , \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Battleground States polling average shows Clinton ahead by 4.3 points . And perhaps even more important , Trump is lagging behind on a number of other key indicators , including candidate favorability .\nAt this point four years ago , Mitt Romney was essentially tied with President Barack Obama , trailing by just four-tenths of a percentage point . With the exception of 1988 , no candidate in modern presidential history who trailed by this much in June has come back to win .\nTrump \u2019 s deficit comes after he closed the gap with Clinton last month , when he pulled even after eliminating Ted Cruz , John Kasich and his other GOP rivals for the nomination . But his standing now is worse than that of the four previous Republican nominees in June of the election year .\nAlready , Trump \u2019 s slide in the polls is having a practical impact on his campaign , contributing to declining confidence in the first-time candidate \u2019 s ability to remain competitive with Clinton \u2014 and spawning a fledgling movement to unbind delegates who could possibly deny Trump the Republican nomination at next month \u2019 s national party convention .\nClinton \u2019 s now-consistent lead over the past month raises an important question for Republicans : Is the cash-strapped Trump campaign , which is allowing tens of millions of dollars of attack ads from Clinton and her allies to go unanswered , wise to preserve its resources for the post-conventions phase of the campaign ? Or do the emerging Clinton advantage and sustained attacks represent a locking-in of voters against Trump ?\nSunday 's public surveys provided further confirmation of that Clinton lead . Nationally , an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 12 points , 51 percent to 39 percent , equaling her largest lead in any telephone survey since both candidates became their parties ' presumptive nominees . Clinton 's lead in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Sunday is smaller , 5 points , but Clinton has now led the past 11 polls conducted by live telephone interviewers .\nThat included surveys out last week , including a Monmouth University poll that showed Clinton leading Trump by 7 points , and a CNN/ORC International poll that gave her a 5-point advantage . In the battleground states , Quinnipiac University polls released last week showed Clinton opening up a lead in Florida , erasing a slight Trump advantage in Ohio and the race remaining neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania .\nTrump appears unconcerned by the movement away from him over the past month , telling The New York Times last week , \u201c I haven \u2019 t started yet. \u201d But Clinton has : Starting late last week , the presumptive Democratic nominee launched a six-week television ad blitz that includes more than $ 20 million spread out over eight battleground states . And that 's backstopped by the pro-Clinton super PAC , Priorities USA , which is spending in those same eight states , with plans to expand into a ninth state , Pennsylvania , after the Independence Day holiday .\nThe divergent strategies are reminiscent of four years ago , when President Barack Obama and his allies spent the late spring and early summer hammering GOP nominee Mitt Romney \u2014 with an inadequate answer from Romney \u2019 s forces .\nThose attacks had little impact on the horse race . Romney was able to mount some response , and polls showed him tied with Obama this time four years ago . But the messages conveyed in those attacks did drive down Romney \u2019 s favorable ratings and set a narrative that would dog the former Massachusetts governor for the rest of the campaign , according to Neil Newhouse , Romney \u2019 s pollster .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t move the ballot [ test ] , but they moved our image , \u201d Newhouse said . \u201c The ballot wasn \u2019 t moving , but other stuff was , which made it harder to move the ballot later on . It began to frame that election early on , and we couldn \u2019 t do a darn thing about it . \u201d\nMany of those other measures point to trouble for Trump . In the Monmouth poll , Trump \u2019 s favorable rating is just 28 percent , with 57 percent having no opinion of him . Clinton \u2019 s was better , though still easily net-negative : 36 percent favorable versus 52 percent unfavorable .\nThe CNN/ORC poll showed a smaller gap in their image ratings \u2014 Trump \u2019 s were negative-19 among registered voters , compared to Clinton \u2019 s negative-15 \u2014 and a 55-percent majority of voters said they expect Clinton to win the general election this fall .\nStill , there were some positive numbers for Trump in the CNN/ORC poll . Respondents said Trump would better handle a number of key issues , like the economy and terrorism . ( Clinton was rated higher on foreign policy and immigration . )\n\u201c Does Hillary have a small but significant lead ? Yeah , she probably does , \u201d said Newhouse . \u201c What I find really interesting in the surveys , [ Trump ] wins on strength , he wins on protecting us , he wins on the economy , and most importantly , he wins on change . \u201d\nBut the balance of indicators , starting with the ballot test , point to a Trump deficit at this point of the campaign . That puts the New York real-estate mogul behind the pace of the past four GOP nominees . In addition to Romney tying Obama at this stage of the campaign , June was when John McCain began to fall behind Obama four years prior . George W. Bush and John Kerry traded the lead during June 2004 , and most polls in June 2000 presaged the close race between Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore .\nThere are some countervailing signs in the data about the extent to which the nature of the race could change . Newhouse said the fact both Clinton and Trump are disliked by majorities of voters suggests the ballot test could bounce around over the next four-and-a-half months . \u201c I think we expect to see a lot of movement , \u201d he said .\nBut Patrick Murray , the Monmouth University pollster , suggested the widespread \u2014 and , in many cases , intense \u2014 disapproval of both likely nominees points to a less-elastic electorate .\n\u201c I think that probably close to 9-in-10 voters are locked in , \u201d Murray said . \u201c That \u2019 s because their feelings about either or both of these candidates are so incredibly strong , or they \u2019 re going to move there . \u201d\nAnd only one candidate is investing real resources to move and reinforce those numbers .\n\u201c I think Clinton \u2019 s lead is actually fundamentally larger than what the polls show now because of where the candidates stand on their personal attributes , \u201d Murray said , pointing to Clinton \u2019 s less-woeful favorability ratings .\nPolitical science research suggests , intuitively , that polls become more predictive closer to the election . But that 's particularly true over the course of the summer months , especially following the parties ' national conventions .\nColumbia University professor Bob Erikson , who co-authored a book that tracked the movement in polls over the timelines of presidential elections going back to 1952 , said Trump is behind at this stage of the campaign , `` but the gap is not that great , and it could be overcome . ''\n`` Both candidates are very well-known and not so well-liked , '' Erikson added , comparing it to the 1980 campaign , `` when Reagan was seen as something of a right-wing extremist , and Carter wasn \u2019 t too popular .
