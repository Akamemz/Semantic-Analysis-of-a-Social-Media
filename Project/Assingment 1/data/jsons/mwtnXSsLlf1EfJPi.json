Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., faces four much younger competitors in next week's Democratic primary, in what could be the toughest re-election bid of his long political career.\n\nNPR's Corey Dade explains:\n\n\"Gentrification in Harlem has pushed out scores of black residents who have been Rangel's core supporters.

It also said: \"Ethnic politics are playing a key role in the primary June 26.
