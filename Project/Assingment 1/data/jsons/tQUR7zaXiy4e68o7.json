    "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s inauguration gave congressional Republicans a once-in-a-generation opportunity to erase a spate of late Obama-era regulations \u2014 and they used it to make a significant dent before the legislative window closes in the coming week .\nSince February , Republicans have used a once-obscure 1996 law to quash 13 `` midnight '' regulations on topics such as coal mining pollution , gun rights , internet privacy , Planned Parenthood funding , retirement savings and even bear hunting in Alaska . A 14th rule-blocking resolution is heading toward Trump \u2019 s desk , and GOP lawmakers hope to kill at least one more rule , on methane pollution , before the clock runs out Thursday .\nThe rollback affects just a fraction of the myriad Obama administration rules that GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration eventually hope to undo , in what White House adviser Steve Bannon has billed as the \u201c deconstruction of the administrative state. \u201d But never before have lawmakers made such dramatic use of the Congressional Review Act , which allows lawmakers and the White House to kill recently enacted regulations without having to overcome Senate filibusters .\nThe results underscore the massive partisan divide on the executive branch powers that President Barack Obama wielded so assertively during his second term .\n\u201c This should be a huge lesson to any future president , that if you \u2019 re going to carry out massive regulations that don \u2019 t have the support of the American people or the American Congress , then perhaps you shouldn \u2019 t be doing it in the first place , \u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner ( R-Colo. ) , who called the outcome \u201c a success for the American people. \u201d He estimated that Congress \u2019 nullification of the rules will save companies tens of billions of dollars in compliance costs .\nSen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) portrayed Republicans \u2019 enthusiastic use of the review act as a deserved comeuppance for Obama . \u201c I think it was bred by the fact that we had a president who said , \u2018 I \u2019 ve got a pen and I \u2019 ve got a phone , \u2019 saying , \u2018 I \u2019 m disregarding Congress , ' '' he said .\nBut Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii had a warning for Republicans : Someday , his party will retake power in Washington .\n\u201c Now that this tool has been exercised , it \u2019 s available to everybody , and we \u2019 ll use it too , \u201d Schatz said . He added : \u201c As long as the statute \u2019 s available to us , then we \u2019 d be crazy not to utilize it for our purposes as well . \u201d\nIn fact , though , Congress has successfully used the act only once before , to kill a Clinton-era ergonomics regulation in 2001 . GOP attempts to use the review act during Obama \u2019 s presidency either failed to make it through Congress or died in presidential vetoes .\nRepublicans \u2019 control of both Congress and the White House allowed them to dust off the 1996 law , which allows the rule-killing resolutions to pass by simple majority votes in both chambers . The regulations they killed included limits on stream pollution by coal companies , restrictions on broadband providers \u2019 reselling of customer data , protections for Planned Parenthood \u2019 s state funding , and an anti-corruption rule requiring energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments .\nUnder the act , lawmakers can use the tool to bypass Senate filibusters within 60 legislative days after a rule takes effect , a period that is due to expire on Thursday for Obama \u2019 s final regulations . Lawmakers could have tried to block any of the dozens of significant Obama-era regulations that took effect after June 2016 , but their capacity was limited by other priorities on Congress \u2019 calendar , such as confirming Trump \u2019 s Cabinet nominees and dealing with Obamacare .\nIn addition , the Obama administration made sure to finish most of its blockbuster regulations long before they would become vulnerable to the congressional attack .\nThat meant the repeals were as much about symbolically attacking Obama as they were about the substance of each targeted rule , said Philip Wallach , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .\n\u201c My understanding is the collectivity of these rules kind of seems like largely a rebuke of the Obama administration in a pretty general sense , rather than necessarily showing that Congress thought very hard about exactly what was at stake with each of these rules , \u201d he said .\n`` I think we \u2019 ve taken maximum opportunity to look at things the country lived without for 228 years , and the Obama administration lived without for at least 7 1/2 , '' Sen.
