This year , the report revealed that the Arctic itself may now be contributing to climate change .\nThat \u2019 s because Arctic soil contains a lot of carbon , which would stay there if the planet wasn \u2019 t warming . As the frozen ground across the Arctic starts to thaw , it releases that carbon , which turns into a greenhouse gas . Some of that carbon gets taken up by plants growing in the summertime , but more and more of it is now escaping into the atmosphere .\n\u201c Thawing permafrost throughout the Arctic could be releasing an estimated 300-600 million tons of net carbon per year to the atmosphere , \u201d the NOAA writes in the report . That \u2019 s roughly the equivalent of Japan \u2019 s annual emissions .\nAnd those emissions are going to increase . \u201c We think that should be two to three times bigger by the end of the century based on the kind of forecasting we \u2019 ve done , \u201d Ted Schuur , an ecologist and the author of the report \u2019 s section on permafrost , said .\nScientists have long feared this tipping point . As Arctic permafrost \u2014 permanently frozen soil \u2014 warms , it starts to release carbon . That fuels more warming , which melts more permafrost , and ... you get it . The cycle continues .\nNow those fears are beginning to come true : \u201c The accelerating feedback from changing permafrost ecosystems to climate change may already be underway , \u201d the report states , ominously .\nPermafrost is a layer of frozen soil that covers 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere . It acts like a giant freezer , keeping microbes , carbon , poisonous mercury , and soil locked in place .\nYou can think of the Arctic as the freezer in your kitchen , but for the planet .\nWhen the freezer in your kitchen is working , the food in it stays very cold , preserved , and intact . But if the freezer compressor breaks , it will slowly heat up . As it heats up , bacteria begin to eat your food , making it go rotten . And as the bacteria do this , they produce carbon dioxide , methane , and other gases and chemicals that smell terrible .\nFor tens of thousands of years , permafrost has kept 1,460 to 1,600 gigatons ( a gigaton is a billion metric tons ) of organic matter trapped in the soil . That \u2019 s more than double the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere . It \u2019 s been slowly building , as plants that manage to grow in the uppermost layers of Arctic soil during the summer are frozen hard and buried in the long , dark winter . Some of this carbon has been frozen for thousands of years .\nThough the permafrost has been thawing in recent years , the carbon it releases is usually taken up by plant life growing in the summer , so the Arctic has not been a contributor to climate change \u2014 until now , that is .\nThe new Arctic Report Card draws its conclusions from the most comprehensive assessments of emissions ever done in the region . One NASA study had planes fly over the Arctic for three years , measuring greenhouse gases over many Arctic ecosystems . \u201c That \u2019 s an unparalleled dataset on this question , \u201d Schuur said . \u201c This is a wake-up call . \u201d\nOther reports looking to the future of the permafrost point to similarly grim conclusions .\nThe UN \u2019 s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) recently released a report totaling 1,000-plus pages , which amassed all of the best evidence on how the icy regions of the world and the oceans are threatened by climate change .\nThat report paints a grim future for the permafrost . Even if the world manages to hit the IPCC target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2100 , the report found that around 25 percent of the permafrost near the surface could still be lost . Changes to the permafrost ( among other changes in the ocean and cryosphere ) \u201c are expected to be irreversible , \u201d the report states .\nIn a more severe scenario where the world continues to increase emissions and we hit 5 degrees of warming , around 69 percent could be lost . That would drastically change the landscape of the Arctic and potentially set off a further acceleration of global warming .\nAll that melted permafrost would release more and more carbon into the atmosphere .\nA 2014 study in Environmental Research Letters estimated that thawing permafrost could release around 120 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere by 2100 , resulting in 0.29\u00b0C of additional warming ( give or take 0.21\u00b0C ) .
