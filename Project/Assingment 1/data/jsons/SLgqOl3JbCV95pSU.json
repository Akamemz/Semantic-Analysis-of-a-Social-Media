As is typical for Trump \u2019 s official communications , it relies pretty heavily on the strategy of saying things that aren \u2019 t true .\nWe know that at Christmas and holiday time , there \u2019 s always that liberal snowflake relative who starts an argument and then runs and hides .\nBe like @ realDonaldTrump and keep winning ! https : //t.co/ReqvRPQquB \u2014 Brad Parscale - Text TRUMP to 88022 ( @ parscale ) December 24 , 2019\nThe environment section , for example , says \u201c we have the cleanest air on record. \u201d That would be great news if it were true , since recent studies indicate that air pollution is much more harmful than previously believed .

On most topics at hand , Trump \u2019 s team has something \u2014 whether true or not \u2014 to say in favor of the Trump administration \u2019 s policy initiatives .

The site talks about how Medicare-for-all requires tax increases , and argues that public option alternatives \u201c are designed to kill employer-provided health plans too. \u201d It also serves up for the reader what it considers a killer line : \u201c Ask your relative if they like going to the DMV ? Now tell them to imagine the government controlling their healthcare system because that \u2019 s exactly what it would be like . \u201d\nPersonally , it has not been my experience that filing reimbursement paperwork with Cigna is a notably superior customer service experience to what \u2019 s provided at the Department of Motor Vehicles . And I suppose the snowflakes might turn this around and ask their older MAGA relatives if they feel Medicare is really so awful .\nBut the key thing is this discussion would leave you with no idea that Trump is actually doing stuff on health insurance \u2014 stuff his reelection campaign can \u2019 t really defend .\nTo review the record here , the Trump administration spent months pushing a variety of Affordable Care Act repeal plans , each of which would have cost tens of millions of people their health insurance . None of those efforts succeeded , but it wasn \u2019 t for lack of trying .\nHe has followed that up by pushing a variety of Medicaid waiver schemes to allow GOP-held states to restrict low-income families \u2019 access to health care . His administration is particularly enthusiastic about work requirements that reduce coverage while doing nothing to encourage work . Work requirements in several states were put on hold by federal courts , but Trump is also remaking the federal judiciary and confirming sympathetic judges at a record pace .
