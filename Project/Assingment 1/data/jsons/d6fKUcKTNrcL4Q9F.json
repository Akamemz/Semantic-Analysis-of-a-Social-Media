    "content": "Halfway through Wednesday \u2019 s off-the-rails CNBC debate , Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus realized he was witnessing a chain-reaction wreck . By the time it ended , he knew it was headed straight for him .\nPriebus has always been keenly aware that the Republican Party has become increasingly vulnerable to outside forces , starting with the unexpected emergence this year of uncontrollable to-hell-with-the-establishment candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson . But outrage over the third GOP debate , during which the candidates and grassroots conservatives attacked the media with a lusty vengeance , posed a new threat \u2013 and Priebus has been fighting ferociously to maintain control of a process he believes is central to reviving the party \u2019 s battered brand and preserving the RNC \u2019 s relevance .\nOver the past two days , the 43-year-old Wisconsinite has been burning out his iPhone battery \u2013 working the lines constantly to head off a revolt by campaigns who want to wrestle the process away from the RNC to suit their individual agendas . In addition to rebuking CNBC , his subtle message to the GOP candidates was simple : We \u2019 ve got your back .\nFormer RNC Chairman Michael Steele said the move appeared to be as much about keeping the RNC as the steward of the debate process as it was about a `` cover our ass '' strategy for the committee , knowing that its presidential candidates are frustrated and contemplating going rogue .\n\u201c You take control of the process , you got to live with the consequences , '' Steele said , `` The candidates are now no longer trusting the system . They \u2019 re no longer trusting the process .\n\u201c The candidates are pissed off because they thought they were going to be placed into an arena where policy would be discussed , not \u2018 When was the last time you hit your wife ? \u2019 It has grown from two or three candidates being pissed off to now all of them . \u201d\nHours after the debate ended , top aides to Trump and Carson \u2013 who believed their candidates had been manhandled by liberal headhunters masquerading as neutral network moderators \u2013 ordered up a Sunday evening meeting ( along with representatives from second-tier denizens Lindsey Graham and Bobby Jindal ) to discuss the fate of the remaining six-plus debates . The RNC wasn \u2019 t invited , though it disputes the nature of the meeting , suggesting it 's been communicating with campaigns who plan to submit a list of joint demands for future debates .\nEach candidate had motives for wanting to revisit a process that had been negotiated by the RNC months earlier . According to people in Trump 's orbit , the real estate mogul and reality TV star wanted to keep the debates shorter ( two hours instead of unwieldy three-hour marathons staged to maximize ad revenue ) and more tightly managed \u2013 in part to limit his exposure to constant incoming fire , in part to assert his skills as a deal-maker , in part to minimize the perception his bombast is pumping up the more likeable Carson .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a camaraderie that \u2019 s been developed between some key campaign leaders . That is a good thing , \u201d said a source close to Trump . \u201c And I think it \u2019 s an insight into how he \u2019 s able to work with others and wants to work with others , and he succeeded in the last debate in terms of setting the terms . Another successful negotiation will only reinforce his strength . \u201d\nThe RNC began trying to cope with the fallout even before the debate ended ; the Bush campaign , among others , believed their candidate was being shorted on airtime \u2013 a complaint furiously relayed to officials at the financial news network in real time . As the candidates unloaded on CNBC \u2014 and the media \u2014 Priebus conspicuously joined the chorus , blasting the moderators afterward for asking `` gotcha questions '' and creating a `` hostile '' environment .\nThe trouble began even before the combatants took the stage on Wednesday . There were disputes over the quality of some candidates ' green rooms . The network was debating stretching the debate a few more money-making minutes , contending that its two-hour timeframe should n't include the time spent on commercials . Then , during the debate , CNBC moderators backtracked on what Republican candidates said was an agreement to allow for opening statements , instead asking them to identify their greatest weaknesses . A moment later , moderator John Harwood asked Trump if he was running the `` comic book version '' of a presidential campaign .\nThen campaigns began complaining about unequal speaking time , and in the end , a scuffling Jeb Bush ended up with the least amount of airtime . Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz confronted CNBC about the imbalance and RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer was seen in an animated conversation with Harwood as the post-debate spin room emptied . ( `` Several campaigns had a concern about time allotments . We approached CNBC on multiple occasions to give us a readout of times , as they promised , and they refused , '' Spicer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . A CNBC source with direct knowledge of the conversations said that Bush was the only candidate mentioned by name . )\nAll that did little to stem the vitriol \u2014 or stop Trump , Carson , Graham and Jindal from taking matters into their hands . Priebus , huddling with his staff and consulting senior Republicans around the country , hastily arranged a call of the RNC 's leadership and Debate Committee Friday morning to reassert control of a process that seemed to be spiraling out control .\n`` We \u2019 re serious . This isn \u2019 t for show , '' said Debates Committee chairman Steve Duprey , an RNC committeeman from New Hampshire , in a phone interview . `` No network should be proud of that debate. \u201d Participants in the call said it was scheduled just 30 minutes ahead of time and that the sentiment \u2013 driven by the chairman \u2013 was unanimous : the party \u2019 s relationship with NBC should be suspended , even if it turns out to just be a slap on the wrist .\nAt the time of the call , the details of the next scheduled debate \u2014 the Nov. 10 meeting on Fox Business Network \u2014 had yet to be hammered out by the campaigns and networks . In any event , the RNC needed to do something bold and symbolic \u2013 an action that would strike a blow against CNBC \u2019 s parent company NBC Universal , which many Republicans view as being in the tank for Democrats . Priebus greeted his people \u2013 and immediately pitched the idea of suspending the party \u2019 s relationship with the network , which had been scheduled to host another debate in February in partnership with Telemundo and National Review , the venerable conservative magazine .\n`` We simply can not continue with NBC without full consultation with our campaigns . The CNBC network is one of your media properties , and its handling of the debate was conducted in bad faith , '' Priebus wrote in a letter he tweeted out on Friday . `` Questions were inaccurate or downright offensive . The first question directed to one of our candidates asked if he was running a comic book version of a presidential campaign , hardly in the spirit of how the debate was billed . '' ( `` This is a disappointing development . However , along with our debate partners at Telemundo , we will work in good faith to resolve this matter with the Republican Party , '' NBC News meekly replied . )\nBut it was more than just a rebuke to the network . The RNC \u2019 s move was an intentional and unsubtle signal to presidential campaigns who have been in open conflict with the committee : We have your back . The move came just hours after \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that the Trump-Carson-Graham-Jindal powwow would take place on Sunday \u2014 and the main topic would be benching the RNC and negotiating terms with the networks either as a group or individually .\nTrouble had been brewing for a while . In the weeks leading up to the CNBC debate , there were intense behind-the-scenes discussions between the campaigns , the RNC and CNBC . At issue : the network \u2019 s refusal to allow opening and closing statements . Several campaigns \u2014 including Trump \u2019 s \u2014 threatened to pull out if they didn \u2019 t get them . CNBC ultimately backed off , telling the RNC \u2014 which was negotiating on the campaigns \u2019 behalf \u2014 it would allow an open-ended opening statement .\nBut CNBC reversed course as soon as the lights went on . \u201c In 30 seconds , without telling us that you try too hard or that you \u2019 re a perfectionist , \u201d co-moderator Carl Quintanilla began , \u201c what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it ? \u201d The debate went downhill from there , as the candidates openly bristled at the questions and whipped up the crowd against the hosts .\nThe fight wasn \u2019 t limited to Republicans and the media . It also unmasked long-simmering frustrations between the RNC and some of its candidates , who say the committee has left them at the mercy of TV networks intent on turning the primary into a Hunger Games-style battle for survival . After the first two debates on Aug. 6 , bottom-of-the-pack candidates began sniping at the RNC , accusing the committee of having its `` thumb on the scale '' because it declined to encourage members to attend the undercard event . Soon afterwards , the RNC began holding twice-monthly calls with campaign representatives to keep lines of dialogue open .\nBut those calls quickly became venting sessions for the campaigns . Prior to Wednesday 's CNBC debate , some campaigns ripped CNBC for suggesting there would n't be opening or closing statements \u2013 if they didn \u2019 t get them , Rand Paul aide Chris LaCivita said on the call , CNBC could \u201c go f -- - themselves . '' Trump threatened to pull out of the contest , and he even bragged during the debate that he extracted concessions from the network to keep the debate to two hours and reinsert opening and closing statements . Lower-tier candidates complained that the RNC intentionally had embarrassed them by requiring them to debate in front of an empty arena , while the top-tier candidates got a full house .\nThe RNC has stopped holding those calls now \u2014 in large part because of frustration over the rampant leaks to the press by participants . During a pre-debate meeting with campaigns on Tuesday in Boulder , Spicer vented about private conference calls going public .\nBut the RNC insists its debate plans are still working . The meeting of the campaigns on Sunday , committee officials say , is just a chance for them to reach consensus on demands for future debates \u2013 a list they 'll submit to the RNC , which will in turn advocate for its candidates . There are unarguably fewer debates , RNC officials note , and they 've been scheduled far enough in advance that candidates can plan for them . Conservative commentators , such as radio host Hugh Hewitt and CNBC \u2019 s Larry Kudlow , have been included on the moderating panels .\nWednesday 's CNBC GOP debate induced unusually high criticism . | AP Photo\nRNC allies are n't convinced the campaigns will be able to come to consensus on how to proceed . Bottom-of-the-pile candidates like Jindal want networks to factor in early-state polls to determine who participates in primetime contents . Similarly , back-of-the-pack Republicans say that rather than tiering the debates based on volatile national poll numbers , candidates should be divided evenly based on a random drawing . Front-running candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson are unlikely to agree to either term .\nNone of this drama was supposed to happen . After 2012 , an RNC panel concluded that Mitt Romney 's loss was at least partly attributable to a primary season packed with 20 debates , many long after Romney appeared to have a lock on the nomination .\n`` The number of debates has become ridiculous , and they \u2019 re taking candidates away from other important campaign activities , '' an RNC autopsy concluded after the 2012 loss .\nThat year , candidates were often invited to debate just a couple weeks in advance , forcing them to disrupt their schedules .
