The NLRB recently told a U.S. Court of Appeals that employers \u2019 concerns that a multiplicity of small bargaining units will cripple their operations are \u201c irrelevant \u201d under U.S. labor law .\nThe Board \u2019 s position was put forward by Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon in a disturbing brief to the Fourth Circuit . It was filed to defend the Obama Board \u2019 s highly controversial decision , Specialty Healthcare , which jettisoned 76 years of Board law . The decision authorized unions in all industries over which the Board has jurisdiction to represent bargaining units of as few as two or more employees doing the same job in the same location . Why do unions want these small units ? Because , among other things , they are easier to organize .\nThe Board \u2019 s decision threatens an undue proliferation of bargaining units , which Congress , state labor boards and other nations have warned about for years .\nSince its inception in 1936 , the NLRB has recognized that an undue proliferation of bargaining units causes unnecessary work stoppages and is inconsistent with the long-term goals of collective bargaining . Therefore , the Board has favored larger units and sought to avoid a multiplicity of smaller units . During Senate debate in 1974 on extending the Board \u2019 s jurisdiction to cover non-profit health care institutions , committee Chairman Senator Harrison A. Williams ( D-NJ ) , no stranger to Board law , recognized this fact . He applauded the NLRB and said that as a rule it has \u201c generally tended to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of bargaining units . \u201d\nThe Board \u2019 s efforts in this regard were also clear in 1989 when it proposed adopting a rule that would make a single facility unit presumptively appropriate . In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking , the NLRB said that the employees \u2019 desire for a single facility unit ( as opposed to the employer \u2019 s desire for a multi-facility unit ) \u201c might be outweighed by concerns over disproportionate , unjustified costs and undue proliferation of units . \u201d\nCongress has consistently taken a position against undue proliferation . During the debates over expanding the Board \u2019 s jurisdiction to include non-profit health care institutions , Congress expressly cautioned the NLRB against an undue proliferation of bargaining units that would cause unnecessary work stoppages and threaten patient care . In its brief , the Board draws from this caution the preposterous conclusion that a multiplicity of bargaining units in all other industries is an \u201c irrelevant \u201d consideration under U.S. labor law .\nCongress \u2019 s admonition to the Board can not be minimized so easily . Non-profit health care institutions were exempted from the National Labor Relations Act \u2019 s ( \u201c Act \u201d ) coverage by the Taft-Hartley amendments of 1947 . Archibald Cox , former Solicitor of Labor and Harvard Law professor , observed that Taft-Hartley was passed because \u201c the public was worried about the power of unions \u201d and \u201c many saw the danger of work stoppages as a threat to our social system. \u201d It stands to reason that when Congress was considering bringing non-profit hospitals back under the Act \u2019 s coverage , it would caution the NLRB to avoid an undue proliferation of bargaining units in that industry .\nNowhere is there any suggestion that Congress was giving a green light to an undue proliferation of bargaining units in other industries .\nThe pre-Obama Board did not stand alone in its concern over micro-unions : labor boards generally recognize its dangers and seek to avoid it . For example , the Illinois Education Labor Board requires that educational units be established \u201c only if they do not \u201d cause an undue proliferation of bargaining units which \u201c means the number of bargaining units is such as to threaten to interrupt services , cause labor instability and \u2026 continual collective bargaining . \u201d\nAnd the labor boards of Canada are in accord .
