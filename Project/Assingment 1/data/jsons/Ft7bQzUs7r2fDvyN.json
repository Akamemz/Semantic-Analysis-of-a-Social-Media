'' The speech is\u2014for good \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2014most famous for its powerful condemnation of slavery , racism , and American hypocrisy . But it also includes passages praising the American Revolution and the Founding Fathers . Both are worth remembering .\nWhat , to the American slave , is your 4th of July ? I answer : a day that reveals to him , more than all other days in the year , the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim . To him , your celebration is a sham ; your boasted liberty , an unholy license ; your national greatness , swelling vanity ; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless ; your denunciations of tyrants , brass fronted impudence ; your shouts of liberty and equality , hollow mockery ; your prayers and hymns , your sermons and thanksgivings , with all your religious parade , and solemnity , are , to him , mere bombast , fraud , deception , impiety , and hypocrisy \u2014 a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages . There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices , more shocking and bloody , than are the people of these United States , at this very hour .\nAnd there is much more material of the same kind in the speech , ranging from a denunciation of the internal slave trade , to an attack on the then-recent Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 . The key point is that slavery and racism made a mockery of America 's professed ideals of liberty and equality . And , sadly , that legacy is far from fully overcome even today .\nBut Douglass ' speech also includes passages like this one , praising the American Revolution :\nFellow Citizens , I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic . The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men . They were great men too \u2014 great enough to give fame to a great age . It does not often happen to a nation to raise , at one time , such a number of truly great men . The point from which I am compelled to view them is not , certainly , the most favorable ; and yet I can not contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration . They were statesmen , patriots and heroes , and for the good they did , and the principles they contended for , I will unite with you to honor their memory . They loved their country better than their own private interests ; and , though this is not the highest form of human excellence , all will concede that it is a rare virtue , and that when it is exhibited , it ought to command respect . He who will , intelligently , lay down his life for his country , is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise . Your fathers staked their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor , on the cause of their country . In their admiration of liberty , they lost sight of all other interests . They were peace men ; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage . They were quiet men ; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression . They showed forbearance ; but that they knew its limits . They believed in order ; but not in the order of tyranny . With them , nothing was `` settled '' that was not right . With them , justice , liberty and humanity were `` final ; '' not slavery and oppression . You may well cherish the memory of such men . They were great in their day and generation . Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times\u2026 . Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment , and stretched away in strength into the distant future . They seized upon eternal principles , and set a glorious example in their defense . Mark them !\nElsewhere in the speech , he also praises the revolutionaries ' refusal to submit to oppression merely because it was backed by law . This is an obvious reference to the those who , in the 1850s , argued that abolitionists had a duty to submit to the Fugitive Slave Act and other unjust proslavery laws . It is also a rebuke to `` just enforce the law '' arguments backing submission to deeply unjust laws in our own day .\nDouglass recognized that the American Revolution not only espoused high principles , but had actually made important progress in realizing them\u2014even as he also condemned the failure to realize them more fully , and the hypocrisy of Americans for tolerating the massive injustice of slavery , which so blatantly contradicted those principles .\nIn other writings and speeches , Douglass also praised the antislavery potential of the Constitution ( which , I think , he in some respects overstated ) . His purpose in the Fourth of July Speech , was not to denounce the Founding Fathers , but rather the white Americans of his own time .\nThis raises the question of how we should think about slavery and the American Revolution today . Elsewhere , I have argued that , on balance , the Revolution gave an important boost to the antislavery cause , in both America and Europe\u2014most notably by inspiring the `` First Emancipation '' \u2014the abolition of slavery in the northern states , which was an essential prerequisite to eventual nationwide abolition .\nI do not , believe , however , that this fact completely exempts the Founders from severe criticism on their record with respect to slavery . Most obviously , they still deserve condemnation for the fact that many of them were slaveowners themselves . People like Thomas Jefferson , George Washington , James Madison , and George Mason all owned slaves throughout most of their lives , even though they well knew it was wrong and a violation of their own principles .\nJefferson famously denounced slavery as `` a moral depravity '' and `` the most unremitting despotism .

It 's hard to avoid the conclusion that they continued to perpetrate a grave injustice because they did not want to suffer the loss of wealth and social status resulting from manumission .\nThis is n't even a matter of `` judging historical figures by modern standards . '' It is a matter of them failing to live up to their own standards .\nIn addition to failing to free their own slaves , most of the Founders also failed to prioritize the abolition of slavery as an institution . They did take some important steps , such as promoting abolition in the northern states , barring the spread of slavery to the `` Old Northwest , '' and eventually banning the importation of new slaves from abroad .
