    "content": "As politics in America continue to grow more negative and more polarized , the words \u201c Democrat \u201d and \u201c Republican \u201d have practically become slurs . This clearly reflects the feelings of voters : Record numbers of them\u201449 percent of the red team and 33 percent of the blue\u2014said in one survey that they would be unhappy if their son or daughter married someone from the other side . Back in 1960 , those numbers were 5 and 4 percent , respectively , which tells you just about everything you need to know about how much more deeply divided we are today .\nI n the election season that ended last Tuesday , it may not always have been clear what candidates stood for , but it sure was easy to tell what they were against . Conservatives hammered away at the fact that their opponents were Democrats , just like the unpopular president . In Massachusetts , whole attack ads were conjured out of ominous repetitions of \u201c Republican \u201d next to Charlie Baker \u2019 s picture .\nHere \u2019 s what \u2019 s strange , though : As much as Americans seem to hate the party they \u2019 re against\u2014roughly 40 percent of both Republicans and Democrats said they had a \u201c very unfavorable \u201d view of the opposing party in a recent Pew poll\u2014their feelings tend to be muted , if not actually ambivalent , about the party they \u2019 re supposedly for . Sure , individual candidates inspire public displays of support , but the parties they represent , not so much . Fully 42 percent of the American public now call themselves \u201c independent , \u201d rather than Democratic or Republican , according to a recent Gallup poll\u2014more than at any other point in history . \u201c People don \u2019 t strongly identify with their parties today , \u201d said Heather Cox Richardson , a political historian at Boston College . \u201c It has become much easier for leaders to get elected by opposing things and creating an enemy rather than creating a big-tent , positive message . When was the last time you saw someone wearing a Democrat or Republican button ? \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t always this way . The last time America was as politically polarized along party lines as it is now , the clash was fueled by genuine excitement about the parties . Starting roughly in the 1830s and ending around the turn of the 20th century , being a Democrat , a Republican , or a Whig was a huge component of one \u2019 s public identity . The \u201c party period , \u201d as it has come to be known among historians , was marked by rowdy and emotional parades and celebrations where people trumpeted their party affiliations the way sports fans today trumpet their allegiance to their favorite teams .\nThe absence of that spirit today says a great deal about how politics has changed . The two parties have increasingly distinguished themselves along clear ideological lines , which means fewer Americans see their own set of beliefs reflected exactly by either one . And in an era when neither party seems capable of accomplishing its goals , Americans are reluctant to embrace either team while growing ever more enraged at the people they believe are responsible for gridlock .\nBut if the rejection of party identity is understandable\u2014and might even seem like an appropriate response to today \u2019 s acid political culture\u2014it also comes with costs . More than they have for generations , the Democrats and the Republicans actually stand for truly distinct ideas about how to govern . The conflict between them isn \u2019 t just a power struggle , but a serious battle over what kind of country we want . And according to some experts , the fact that so many Americans don \u2019 t passionately or proudly identify with either side\u2014even if they do hold the other in extreme contempt\u2014contributes to a political culture in which neither party enjoys enough loyalty to govern effectively . To look back at the positive partisanship of the 19th century is to wonder how much less toxic and gridlocked our system might be today if , instead of merely loathing the party we liked less , we could channel our polarization into fervent enthusiasm for the one we liked more .\nThe founding fathers hated the idea of political parties . They envisioned a new kind of government in which ideas could be debated without the interference of power-hungry factions and corrupt alliances . \u201c There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties , each arranged under its leader , and concerting measures in opposition to each other , \u201d wrote John Adams in 1780 . \u201c This , in my humble apprehension , is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution . \u201d\nIt did not take long for his nightmare to come to pass . Political parties emerged almost immediately , and became not only the organizing force behind government , but also a primary way in which people defined themselves throughout much of the country . \u201c Party passions were deeply ingrained in 19th-century American life , \u201d said Richard McCormick , a political historian and the former president of Rutgers University . \u201c They reflected your community , your ethnic associations , your economic associations . Men passed their party passions on to their sons . \u201d\nTo be a member of a party , as Indiana University-Bloomington historian Michael McGerr details in his book \u201c The Decline of Popular Politics , \u201d was at the core of men \u2019 s participation in their local communities . \u201c They marched in the streets , they held massive rallies , they decorated their houses for parades going by , \u201d McGerr said . \u201c Intense partisanship was a cultural norm .... Even in a place like New York City , theater owners would complain during presidential elections that their audience numbers were down because people were drawn to this outdoor political spectacle . \u201d\nDuring parades , people carried torches , performed military-style drills in honor of their party , and dressed up their children\u2014boys as Uncle Sam , girls as the goddess of liberty . \u201c They \u2019 d have the little kids stand on the walk of the house , to salute and be seen as the parade went by , \u201d said McGerr . \u201c When a Democratic parade would go by , a Republican partisan would turn out all the lights in the house . \u201d\nThe idea of being an independent , someone who didn \u2019 t stand with either party , was looked upon with disdain . \u201c [ To be ] a partisan was to be a man , \u201d said McGerr . \u201c The first visible independents in the 1870s were derided with such terms as \u2018 man-milliners \u2019 \u2014so , male hat makers , which was clearly a sort of gay slur . \u201d\nToday , we might see this kind of us-versus-them division as destructive . In another sense , though , the democracy was astonishingly vibrant : Turnout rates among eligible voters reached levels they haven \u2019 t approached since .\nOver time , that enthusiasm cooled . Politics became less local and more national , and the patronage system that fueled the party machines of the 19th century weakened . In time , the \u201c independent \u201d label lost its shame . When the Progressive movement took hold at the end of the 1800s , promising a new kind of politics , being an independent started to be seen as a point of pride\u2014an indication that you formed your opinions using reason , rather than taking your cues from those around you .\nToday , the political system is drastically different . We choose candidates by voting in messy , hard-fought primaries , rather than trusting party bosses to hash out the ticket in back-room negotiations . Where parties used to be \u201c big tents , \u201d with conservatives and liberals populating both sides of the aisle , they \u2019 ve become much more ideologically narrow , leaving out wide swaths of centrist voters . Decades of negative campaigning have left each party tarred with epithets : Voters have to choose between being a tax-and-spend liberal or a fat-cat Republican .\nThe two-party system itself is widely seen as fundamentally flawed , and being a diehard partisan has few positive connotations\u2014to the point where our political leaders themselves , though clearly and openly aligned with a party , don \u2019 t make much of their affiliation . \u201c In this country , politics is not about party anymore , \u201d said Bruce Newman , editor of the Journal of Political Marketing and a professor at DePaul University .\nThis leaves the United States in a strange position , with a government locked down by parties that people don \u2019 t especially love or identify with . Politicians know this : In his first interview as the governor-elect of Massachusetts , Baker distanced himself from the GOP , and said he wasn \u2019 t even sure he \u2019 d attend the 2016 Republican National Convention . You don \u2019 t see this in other democratic countries , according to Newman . \u201c If you go to Europe and Latin America , \u201d he said , \u201c you see that party affiliation is what \u2019 s driving politics in just about every country besides this one . \u201d\nPolitical scientists and historians warn against harboring nostalgia for the party period , or casting it as a golden age of democratic participation . For one thing , only white men could vote ; whatever is wrong with American democracy these days , it doesn \u2019 t exclude more than half of the adult population . Scholars also point out that part of what made people so passionate about politics was that party leaders frequently rewarded such passion with jobs , and that those lively , spirited marches and parades were popular in part because they were the only form of entertainment around . To a great extent , experts say , the zealous partisanship that characterized 19th-century politics was about not ideas or principles , but self-interest and simple competition . \u201c The kind of excitement that you saw back then was really about choosing sides , \u201d said Hans Noel , a political scientist at Georgetown University and author of the 2013 book \u201c Political Ideologies and Political Parties in America. \u201d \u201c You could probably quiz those people who were shutting the lights off in their houses about what the opposing party thought , and they probably wouldn \u2019 t know . \u201d\nIn that light , it \u2019 s possible to see something noble in the two parties as they exist today : At least the modern enmity between the Democrats and the Republicans comes down to real ideas , with one side standing up for small government and unrestrained free enterprise , and the other arguing for a social safety net that protects the weak and unlucky . According to Dartmouth College political scientist Russell Muirhead , voters may be missing an opportunity by refusing to identify proudly and unequivocally with either . In his new book , \u201c The Promise of Party in a Polarized Age , \u201d Muirhead argues for what he calls \u201c high partisanship , \u201d in which people take seriously the division between Democrats and Republicans , and align themselves solidly with one or the other based on their principles . \u201c Hidden in the partisan fray , which is often a huge distraction and a counterproductive mess , is a deep difference about ... the direction the country should take , \u201d Muirhead said . \u201c It \u2019 s not a difference without reason\u2014it \u2019 s a difference that citizens should probably think about . \u201d\nWe might be tempted to hold our noses and step away , but there \u2019 s a good argument that engaging with the party we support matters more than it used to , rather than less . At a time when control of the legislature flips based on the very recent achievements and failures of whoever was in control of it last , governing becomes practically impossible unless more voters pick a side and stick with it long enough to see actual results . In the current climate , Muirhead said , \u201c we condemn policies as unsuccessful before we \u2019 ve given them enough time to work. \u201d He added : \u201c What loyal partisans bring to a party is patience . A Democrat who voted for Obama shouldn \u2019 t be thrown off balance by a few bad months . \u201d\nSomewhat counterintuitively , Muirhead believes that if we had more patient and seriously engaged partisans , there \u2019 s a chance we could chip away at the political polarization expressed in those findings about people not wanting their kids to marry outside their party .\n\u201c The deep ideas that motivate conservatives and liberals , Republicans and Democrats , are interesting and worthy ideas , \u201d he says , \u201c and it \u2019 s not always easy to know which one \u2019 s better , or which one \u2019 s perfect . And if you think about partisanship that way , it can instill a little bit of humility in yourself about your own convictions . \u201d\n\u2022 The Internationalist : How can America really promote democracy abroad ?\n\u2022 Text \u2018 aye , \u2019 matey !
