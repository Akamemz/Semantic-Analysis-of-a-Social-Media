'' `` That would help to explain why politics can be so polarized , particularly in a rather conservative era like the present , '' he wrote . Their biological predisposition to fear `` illuminates the conservative take on specific political issues in fairly obvious ways , '' he argues . For example , they are more religious `` because religious rituals foster feelings of safety in a dangerous world . '' Liberals , of course , are less religious because they see the world as less threatening and they rely more on science and education to solve problems . Conservatives `` tend to be more hostile to immigrants , foreigners , and racial or ethnic minorities and to view them as more of a threat .
