    "content": "Dear Reader ( Including the Amy Klobuchar intern kept in a crate in the back office ) ,\nOne of my favorite Twitter accounts is the official Twitter feed of the Socialist party of Great Britain . Folks often criticize me for engaging with it because it is so irrelevant , even in socialist circles . That in itself is a kind of accomplishment . It \u2019 s like the guy who attends Civil War reenactment-society meetings , but dresses in full Klingon battle regalia and screams at everyone that no one knows how to fight Romulans . \u201c You call yourselves warriors , but none of you even knows how to swing a Bat \u2019 leth ! \u201d\nVirtually every time anyone says anything critical of Maduro \u2019 s \u2014 or Stalin \u2019 s \u2014 socialism , the SPGB Twitter feed leaps into action , raining \u201c ACKSHULLYS \u201d down like a UFC fighter beating on a 98-pound mugger . \u201c Actually \u201d real socialism is collective ownership of the means of production ! Real socialism has never been tried ! Soviet Communism was \u201c state capitalism ! \u201d You can almost smell the old socks and stale urine wafting up from the guy tweeting from some public-library computer , his overstuffed shopping cart full of dog-eared copies of Das Kapital and back issues of Juggs close by his side .\nBut that \u2019 s kinda what I like about the SPGB . At least they take their ideas seriously . They \u2019 ve constructed a wholly hypothetical alternative world that is simultaneously as plausible and impossible as Middle Earth or Westeros or a great meal at a Wolfgang Puck Express at the Newark airport . It sounds like it could be real , and it \u2019 s kind of fun to think about , but it \u2019 s not actually reality . It \u2019 s like they think they can pluck the Platonic ideal of a hamburger out of the ether and use it as a rhetorical cudgel to say a Five Guys burger \u201c isn \u2019 t a real hamburger ! Real hamburgers have never been tried ! \u201d Even the Wikipedia entry on the SPGB says : \u201c The party \u2019 s political position has been described as a form of impossibilism . \u201d\nI don \u2019 t think anyone will be shocked to know that I \u2019 ve won several chicken-eating contests , but that \u2019 s not important right now . It also shouldn \u2019 t be too much of a surprise that I \u2019 m no expert on Carl Jung , rumors of my ass-tattoo notwithstanding . But I do find some of his ideas interesting , and not just his stuff on the designated hitter rule . I think there \u2019 s something to the idea of the collective unconscious . Certain ideas or concepts \u2014 archetypes according Jung \u2014 pop up in every culture .\nI once listened to a great episode of Radio Lab in which they talked about a fossilized skull of a young human that had been grabbed by a giant bird and carried off ( they could tell from the talon marks inside its eye sockets . Let that image sink in ) . In our prehistoric past , there were birds that preyed on us , and that \u2019 s why , they speculated , we get even to this day that creepy fight-or-flight feeling when a shadow passes over our heads . We \u2019 ve got some \u201c Oh crap , run ! \u201d programming in us left over from when a shadow from above terrifying . According to Jung , people all around the world have snake dreams even though they may never have seen a snake or Michael Cohen .\nThis is how I mostly think about socialism now ( as I recently discussed on the Tikvah podcast ) . At its core , it \u2019 s not an idea or even a program : It \u2019 s a feeling . The world of liberal democratic capitalism is unnatural . \u201c Unique among species , \u201d Robin Fox writes in The Tribal Imagination , \u201c we created the novel environment , and the supernovel environment that followed on the Miracle , by ourselves and for ourselves. \u201d But just because our environment is new , our programming is still very old . A pampered dog that has never known life outside a big city probably still dreams of running through the woods in a pack , and somewhere deep inside of us we dream of living in a tightknit community , a tribe or band , where we share all of our possessions and are \u201c all in it together . \u201d\nIndeed , Marx \u2019 s vision of the glorious end of history tracked nicely with various romantic fantasies of what man \u2019 s life in a state of nature was really like . Of course , these fantasies bore little resemblance to the real world of our ancient past where giant fricking birds could pluck us from the savannahs and feed us , piecemeal , to giant baby birds .\nI was eight when I first saw the George Burns movie Oh , God , but one line always stuck with me . God/Burns is explaining some of his big mistakes . \u201c Ostriches were a mistake . Silly looking things . Avocados . . . Made the pit too big. \u201d But he also said , \u201c The reason I put everyone here naked . . . I wasn \u2019 t trying to be cute . It \u2019 s just that with clothes there \u2019 s right away pockets , and pockets , you got ta put something in \u2018 em . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a point there . Private property is divisive . It arouses envy , and envy is a hugely powerful emotion , a driver of all manner of political evils . But in a state of nature , it \u2019 s a tool of social cohesion , just like altruism and shame . Envy is one of the emotions that leads to sharing , because it causes the group to demand the haves to share with the have-nots .\nThe thing is , where humans are nomadic , it \u2019 s hard to accumulate too much private property when you can only keep what you can carry .\nNow we can have a lot of property , but we also have a lot of baggage in the form of an inarticulate yearning to restore an imagined past . It \u2019 s an instinct for solidarity that manifests itself in different forms in different ages , grafting itself to different priestly or technocratic lingo . But you can incant all the Marxist verbiage you like , it doesn \u2019 t make the underlying idea more modern .\nIn Ghostbusters , when the very Jungian Gozer the Gozerian says : \u201c Choose the form of your destructor , \u201d the team tries to keep their minds blank . But Ray couldn \u2019 t help himself . \u201c I couldn \u2019 t help it . It just popped in there. \u201d And that \u2019 s all it took for a Godzilla-sized Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man to materialize .\n\u201c I tried to think of the most harmless thing , \u201d Ray says . \u201c Something I loved from my childhood , something that could never , ever possibly destroy us : Mr. Stay-Puft . \u201d\nSocialism works in a similar way . Whether it \u2019 s the Socialist Party of Great Britain or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the millions of young people who think they \u2019 re socialists , they think socialism is a good thing that can do no wrong , and if it does wrong it must be because it \u2019 s not really socialism . I understand why conservatives think socialism is evil \u2014 because there are so many examples of socialism being evil . But most socialists don \u2019 t think they \u2019 re evil \u2014 nor is it their greatest dream to steal our hamburgers : Socialism is just their word for fixing what \u2019 s wrong with the world . The problem is that when you give yourself over to a single idea of how things should be , you check yourself into what Chesterton called \u201c the clean and well-lit prison of one idea \u201d and you become \u201c sharpened to one painful point. \u201d You are bereft of the \u201c healthy hesitation and healthy complexity \u201d that lets you grasp the world as it is and understand the crooked timber of human nature .\nIn the fantasy world of the SPGB , we \u2019 d all share equally society \u2019 s wealth . But what this vision leaves out is the socialist with the clipboard that keeps track of who gets their \u201c fair share \u201d and the men with guns who protect the man with the clipboard from those who disagree with his decisions . The man who says \u201c get in line for your share \u201d is the new ruler of every would-be utopia . The clipboard becomes a totem of power no less ominous than the ball and scepter , the whip , the fasces , or the phone the person in power uses to make you disappear . Humans make hierarchies of status and privilege for themselves whenever the opportunity avails itself . This is why all socialist systems that do not work within the constraints of a liberal democratic framework of the rule of law inevitably descend into tyrannies . Give the state unbridled power , and the denizens of the state will use that power toward their own ends .\nBut socialism is just one form of destructor that can be unleashed to trample the complex ecosystem of liberty in pursuit of a single idea . Nationalism , fascism , and almost every other ism can , in service to the same cult of unity , do the same damage .\nOne-thingism is the enemy of all freedoms , even the one thing of freedom itself . As Peregrine Worsthorne once noted , a doctrine of total freedom pursued to its logical conclusion is a world where bullies are free to do their will . Ordered liberty is a different concept altogether because it balances the tension between the need for both order and liberty . We are free to do the things that do not harm others unjustifiably . Which brings me to . . .\nI don \u2019 t like debating abortion , but every now and then I get dragooned into it . The other day , I was on Guy Benson and Marie Harf \u2019 s radio show , and we got into it because Ben Sasse \u2019 s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act bill had just gone down in flames . I like Marie quite a bit , and I think she tries very hard to give conservatives a fair hearing , so I don \u2019 t mean any of this as a personal criticism . But she ran through all of the usual arguments , the chief of which was the old saw about how conservatives are hypocrites because they want the government out of everything , yet they want the state to regulate women \u2019 s reproductive choices .\nMy problem with this argument is that it suffers from a profound category error . The first obligation of the state is to protect human life . This is what Max Weber was getting at when he said the state has a \u201c monopoly on violence. \u201d In a decent and free society , this monopoly has only a handful of legitimate exceptions . The most important and obvious is the right to self-defense , which is an absolute natural right that is prior to any form of government . You can not pass a just and enforceable law barring people from fighting for their life when attacked .\nThe other exceptions are fairly minor and still fall under the regulatory power of the state . Boxers need licenses after all . Police have discretion about how to deal with bar room fights . Whether or not spanking is good or bad for kids , I think parents have a right to do it . But we all recognize that the state has a right to intervene when parents go much beyond that kind of thing . A swat on the backside for a misbehaving child isn \u2019 t the government \u2019 s business . A parent who beats or burns their kid should have their kid taken away .\nThis sliding scale has an analogue in the abortion debate \u2014 not theologically or scientifically perhaps \u2014 but culturally and politically . Most Americans favor abortion rights shortly after conception through the end of the first trimester . Even larger majorities are opposed to late-term abortions .\nAgain , putting aside the philosophical , scientific , and theological arguments , this simply makes sense . People can understandably debate whether a young embryo should be considered a human being . But there is simply no credible moral argument that a viable baby should not be considered a human being . A late-term fetus strikes most reasonable people as a baby , not some abstracted and euphemized thing called \u201c uterine contents \u201d or whatnot . And a delivered baby outside the womb or in the process of delivery is , simply , a baby . The Barbara Boxer view that a baby miraculously becomes a baby only after you bring it home from the hospital is a moral monstrosity .\nAnd this is why conservative pro-lifers are not hypocrites when they say the state should intervene on the behalf of babies . The real hypocrisy cuts the other way . Liberal abortion rights supporters \u2014 speaking broadly \u2014 have no principled objection to the state regulating the size of our sodas , banning plastic straws or regulating free speech . But going by the statements and votes of the last month \u2014 by Ralph Northam , Andrew Cuomo , Kamala Harris , and so many others \u2014 they draw the line at regulating infanticide .\nHarris , a 2020 hopeful who voted against Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse \u2019 s bill , would not say if abortion was ever immoral . \u201c I think it \u2019 s up to a woman to make that decision , and I will always stand by that , \u201d she told The DCNF . \u201c I think she needs to make that decision with her doctor , with her priest , with her spouse . I would leave that decision up to them . \u201d\nHarris supports the Women \u2019 s Health Protection Act ( as do Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Beto O \u2019 Rourke , Kristen Gillibrand , Amy Klobuchar , and Bernie Sanders ) . It would eliminate nearly all limits on abortion from late-term bans to abortions based on sex-selection ( one wonders how they would feel if transgender fetuses could be identified in utero ) .\nThis isn \u2019 t ordered liberty ; it \u2019 s the freedom of the jungle which says you can do whatever you can get away with . It \u2019 s fine to argue that \u201c abortions \u201d of viable , healthy , babies are rare ( putting aside all the begged questions implicit in the word \u201c healthy. \u201d Do otherwise healthy kids with Down Syndrome count as unhealthy ? ) . But what we \u2019 re talking about is the principle . If I said , \u201c Look , it \u2019 s extremely rare for women to kill left-handed dudes named Todd who think E.L.O was better than the Rolling Stones , \u201d that would be a true statement . It would not be an argument for killing that poor unlucky Todd with terrible taste in music ( Jack \u2019 s view notwithstanding ) .\nJust as socialism represents an atavistic impulse to return to pre-modern understandings of politics , the new push for killing inconvenient babies \u2014 in principle \u2014 is a barbaric step backward to pre-civilized past . Infanticide in our natural environment was incredibly common . This is from part of my book that didn \u2019 t make publication :\nWith the exception of the Jews , virtually all ancient societies , Western and non- Western , routinely butchered , burned , smothered or otherwise slaughtered their own children ( and the children of their enemies even more ) . The Svans of Ancient Georgia murdered newborn girls by filling their mouths with hot ashes . In parts of Ancient China , female babies were killed by submerging them in buckets of cold \u201c baby water. \u201d In feudal Japan , the practice of Makibi ( a term borrowed from rice farming meaning \u201c thinning out \u201d ) was widespread . Unwanted babies \u2014 mostly girls , but also some boys , particularly twins ( which were considered unlucky or dangerous in many pre-modern societies ) \u2014 were snuffed out with a wet cloth . In India infants were sometimes thrown into the Ganges as sacrifices or had their throats cut . As the anthropologist Laila Williamson famously wrote : Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity , from hunters and gatherers to high civilization , including our own ancestors . Rather than being an exception , then , it has been the rule .\nIn pre-historic times , which were no Eden , our ancestors often killed their offspring because they were a real burden and adoption agencies were few and far between . And when I say a real burden , I mean a real burden . Mothers often didn \u2019 t have enough milk to feed two infants , which is why the killing of twins was so common . Crying babies when enemy tribes or predators are about are as inconvenient as hungry toddlers when food is scarce .\nOne aspect of the amazing miracle of the environment we live in now \u2013 i.e . civilization \u2014 is that killing babies is no longer a necessity , but a luxury . This move to disguise this hideous luxury as a new form of necessity is not a sign that we are advancing as a civilization , but that we are regressing , back to when killing babies was natural and normal .\nCanine Update : So there \u2019 s this new trail I \u2019 ve been taking the beasts to that Zo\u00eb particularly likes because it \u2019 s infested with deer and fat , slow squirrels . Since they both partake of our public waterways quite frequently , I didn \u2019 t think much of the fact that they went into the creek there , too . But the water didn \u2019 t seem to be right . And they both got sick . For about 24 hours , Zo\u00eb was farting to the extent that I think she would be banned under the Green New Deal . And both of them were relieving themselves in a way that suggested they had bad tummies \u2014 at times it was like a fine mist of Paul Krugman columns . Perhaps because Zo\u00eb has an iron stomach that allows her to eat stuff best left to the buzzards , or perhaps because she merely took a few sips rather than immersing herself , spaniel-style , Pippa seemed harder hit . She always had her energy out on walks . Tennis balls \u2014 and even floppy frisbees \u2014 are like anti-Kryptonite , giving her super-canine stamina . But when home , she had only Jeb-like energy levels and wouldn \u2019 t eat her dinner ( though one night , the Fair Jessica managed to hand feed her a little ) . If she didn \u2019 t seem better this morning we would have gone to the vet . But the good news is it seems the bug is gone . Pippa \u2019 s appetite is back , and Dingo flatulence levels are back within normal parameters . Beyond that , everything is good . The Dingo is happy and frisky and demanding of attention . And Pippa is Pippa .\nIn other news , theirs is a fierce competition on Twitter for the best conservative dog-tweeting account . So far , we \u2019 ve been sailing through the early contests . But the tough competition is ahead . If I make it through this round , I could soon face Nikki Haley and her unfairly cute pooch Bentley ( I \u2019 m tempted to demand a blood test ) . As of this writing , Bentley is in a fierce dog-eat-dog contest with dark dog contender Yoko ( of Neontaster fame ) . There could be an upset , which would roil the betting markets on both sides of the Atlantic .\nA surprise Yoko upset might be best \u2014 despite his indisputable game \u2014 because the Fair Jessica works for Ambassador Haley . So far , Jessica has not asked me to take a dive if it comes to a head-to-head contest . But if , somehow , the dynamic duo of Dingo & Spaniel gets past Bentley , the odds-on favorite in the finals is none other than Dana Perino and Jasper , the Hungarian-American wunderhound who inherited the undisputed title of \u201c It Dog of the American Right \u201d after Cosmo the Wonderdog \u2019 s demise . I love Dana and have boundless respect for Jasper \u2019 s skills . But I am hoping that there will be some reward for my steadfast dog tweeting .

You cannot pass a just and enforceable law barring people from fighting for their life when attacked.\n\nThe other exceptions are fairly minor and still fall under the regulatory power of the state. Boxers need licenses after all. Police have discretion about how to deal with bar room fights. Whether or not spanking is good or bad for kids, I think parents have a right to do it. But we all recognize that the state has a right to intervene when parents go much beyond that kind of thing. A swat on the backside for a misbehaving child isn\u2019t the government\u2019s business. A parent who beats or burns their kid should have their kid taken away.\n\nThis sliding scale has an analogue in the abortion debate \u2014 not theologically or scientifically perhaps \u2014 but culturally and politically. Most Americans favor abortion rights shortly after conception through the end of the first trimester. Even larger majorities are opposed to late-term abortions.\n\nAgain, putting aside the philosophical, scientific, and theological arguments, this simply makes sense. People can understandably debate whether a young embryo should be considered a human being. But there is simply no credible moral argument that a viable baby should not be considered a human being. A late-term fetus strikes most reasonable people as a baby, not some abstracted and euphemized thing called \u201cuterine contents\u201d or whatnot. And a delivered baby outside the womb or in the process of delivery is, simply, a baby. The Barbara Boxer view that a baby miraculously becomes a baby only after you bring it home from the hospital is a moral monstrosity.\n\nAnd this is why conservative pro-lifers are not hypocrites when they say the state should intervene on the behalf of babies. The real hypocrisy cuts the other way. Liberal abortion rights supporters \u2014 speaking broadly \u2014 have no principled objection to the state regulating the size of our sodas, banning plastic straws or regulating free speech. But going by the statements and votes of the last month \u2014 by Ralph Northam, Andrew Cuomo, Kamala Harris, and so many others \u2014 they draw the line at regulating infanticide.\n\nFrom LifeNews about Kamala Harris\u2019 recent comments:\n\nHarris, a 2020 hopeful who voted against Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse\u2019s bill, would not say if abortion was ever immoral. \u201cI think it\u2019s up to a woman to make that decision, and I will always stand by that,\u201d she told The DCNF. \u201cI think she needs to make that decision with her doctor, with her priest, with her spouse. I would leave that decision up to them.\u201d\n\nHarris supports the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (as do Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Kristen Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, and Bernie Sanders). It would eliminate nearly all limits on abortion from late-term bans to abortions based on sex-selection (one wonders how they would feel if transgender fetuses could be identified in utero).\n\nThis isn\u2019t ordered liberty; it\u2019s the freedom of the jungle which says you can do whatever you can get away with. It\u2019s fine to argue that \u201cabortions\u201d of viable, healthy, babies are rare (putting aside all the begged questions implicit in the word \u201chealthy.\u201d Do otherwise healthy kids with Down Syndrome count as unhealthy?). But what we\u2019re talking about is the principle. If I said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s extremely rare for women to kill left-handed dudes named Todd who think E.L.O was better than the Rolling Stones,\u201d that would be a true statement. It would not be an argument for killing that poor unlucky Todd with terrible taste in music (Jack\u2019s view notwithstanding).\n\nJust as socialism represents an atavistic impulse to return to pre-modern understandings of politics, the new push for killing inconvenient babies \u2014 in principle \u2014 is a barbaric step backward to pre-civilized past. Infanticide in our natural environment was incredibly common. This is from part of my book that didn\u2019t make publication:\n\nWith the exception of the Jews, virtually all ancient societies, Western and non- Western, routinely butchered, burned, smothered or otherwise slaughtered their own children (and the children of their enemies even more). The Svans of Ancient Georgia murdered newborn girls by filling their mouths with hot ashes. In parts of Ancient China, female babies were killed by submerging them in buckets of cold \u201cbaby water.\u201d In feudal Japan, the practice of Makibi (a term borrowed from rice farming meaning \u201cthinning out\u201d) was widespread. Unwanted babies \u2014 mostly girls, but also some boys, particularly twins (which were considered unlucky or dangerous in many pre-modern societies) \u2014 were snuffed out with a wet cloth. In India infants were sometimes thrown into the Ganges as sacrifices or had their throats cut. As the anthropologist Laila Williamson famously wrote: Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunters and gatherers to high civilization, including our own ancestors. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule.\n\nIn pre-historic times, which were no Eden, our ancestors often killed their offspring because they were a real burden and adoption agencies were few and far between. And when I say a real burden, I mean a real burden. Mothers often didn\u2019t have enough milk to feed two infants, which is why the killing of twins was so common. Crying babies when enemy tribes or predators are about are as inconvenient as hungry toddlers when food is scarce.\n\nOne aspect of the amazing miracle of the environment we live in now \u2013 i.e. civilization \u2014 is that killing babies is no longer a necessity, but a luxury. This move to disguise this hideous luxury as a new form of necessity is not a sign that we are advancing as a civilization, but that we are regressing, back to when killing babies was natural and normal.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nAs the Klobuchar staffer who accidentally hung her boss\u2019s pant suit on a wire hanger said, \u201cDear God, what have I done?\u201d By now, you probably heard that I am going to be stepping down as a senior editor of National Review in the coming months (details have yet to be worked out). I cannot begin to describe how difficult and painful this decision was, despite how excited I am about this new chapter of my professional life. I love this place. I\u2019ve given the bulk of my adult life to it (\u201cYour \u2018adult\u2019 life? So like, six months?\u201d \u2014 The Couch). Some of my closest friends have been made here. This is also where I got to know you, Dear Readers, many of whom have become friends in the corporeal realm outside my email box. National Review is part of me, and always will be. I want it to succeed, and I want to stay part of the family (which is why I will stay on as a fellow at the National Review Institute). I am incalculably grateful to Rich Lowry and literally every one of my colleagues, and, again, to all of you (except for that Todd guy). There will be plenty of time for me to get weepy (again) about all of this, and I don\u2019t want to use National Review to promote my new venture with Steve Hayes. But if you\u2019re interested in getting updates on the project as it proceeds, you can send an email to HayesGoldberg2019@Gmail.com, and we\u2019ll keep you in the loop. We\u2019ll never sell your email or anything like that. And that\u2019s enough about all that for now.\n\nCanine Update: So there\u2019s this new trail I\u2019ve been taking the beasts to that Zo\u00eb particularly likes because it\u2019s infested with deer and fat, slow squirrels. Since they both partake of our public waterways quite frequently, I didn\u2019t think much of the fact that they went into the creek there, too. But the water didn\u2019t seem to be right. And they both got sick. For about 24 hours, Zo\u00eb was farting to the extent that I think she would be banned under the Green New Deal. And both of them were relieving themselves in a way that suggested they had bad tummies \u2014 at times it was like a fine mist of Paul Krugman columns. Perhaps because Zo\u00eb has an iron stomach that allows her to eat stuff best left to the buzzards, or perhaps because she merely took a few sips rather than immersing herself, spaniel-style, Pippa seemed harder hit. She always had her energy out on walks. Tennis balls \u2014 and even floppy frisbees \u2014 are like anti-Kryptonite, giving her super-canine stamina. But when home, she had only Jeb-like energy levels and wouldn\u2019t eat her dinner (though one night, the Fair Jessica managed to hand feed her a little). If she didn\u2019t seem better this morning we would have gone to the vet. But the good news is it seems the bug is gone. Pippa\u2019s appetite is back, and Dingo flatulence levels are back within normal parameters. Beyond that, everything is good. The Dingo is happy and frisky and demanding of attention. And Pippa is Pippa.\n\nIn other news, theirs is a fierce competition on Twitter for the best conservative dog-tweeting account. So far, we\u2019ve been sailing through the early contests. But the tough competition is ahead. If I make it through this round, I could soon face Nikki Haley and her unfairly cute pooch Bentley (I\u2019m tempted to demand a blood test). As of this writing, Bentley is in a fierce dog-eat-dog contest with dark dog contender Yoko (of Neontaster fame). There could be an upset, which would roil the betting markets on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nA surprise Yoko upset might be best \u2014 despite his indisputable game \u2014 because the Fair Jessica works for Ambassador Haley. So far, Jessica has not asked me to take a dive if it comes to a head-to-head contest. But if, somehow, the dynamic duo of Dingo & Spaniel gets past Bentley, the odds-on favorite in the finals is none other than Dana Perino and Jasper, the Hungarian-American wunderhound who inherited the undisputed title of \u201cIt Dog of the American Right\u201d after Cosmo the Wonderdog\u2019s demise. I love Dana and have boundless respect for Jasper\u2019s skills. But I am hoping that there will be some reward for my steadfast dog tweeting. Only time will tell.\n\nICYMI\u2026\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nDemocrats are actually being socialists now\n\nThis week\u2019s first Remnant, with Tim Carney on his hugely important and good book.\n\nThe Mueller muddle\n\nCornyn didn\u2019t endorse Mussolini, but some of the original New Dealers did\n\nRules of engagement\n\nThoughts on Cohen\n\nThis week\u2019s second Remnant, with David French in which David and I had a grand time covering everything from abortion and Michael Cohen to the EMP that prevents Westeros from developing transistors.\n\nTrump\u2019s North Korea failure is almost success\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nSpiders eat opossums now\n\nBreaking news: Yosemite is incredible\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can eat a zombie deer\n\nRats can\u2019t handle their whiskey\n\nSlovenian MP quits after stealing a sandwich\n\nLegoDune\n\nMinnesota dog mayor passses away\n\nFat rat stuck in a manhole cover\n\nLucky Charms flavored beer?
