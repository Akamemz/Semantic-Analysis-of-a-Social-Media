( Brian Snyder/Reuters )\nJohn McCain loved his country , and his country was fortunate to receive that love .\nNo one could have begrudged McCain if after five years in a cage , in some of the worst imaginable conditions as a prisoner of war , he became a bitter , angry man . He had five years of his life taken from him , spent two years in solitary confinement , was beaten two to three times a week , refused an early release , and was left permanently disabled . On top of all that , many of his countrymen failed to properly appreciate the sacrifices of himself and his fellow Vietnam veterans . How many of us could even remotely resemble \u201c happy warriors \u201d after experiences like that ?\nMcCain publicly catalogued his wild and crazy years after his return , and his failures in his first marriage , but he figured out that he had a lot more he could and should do with his time remaining on this earth . And what a legacy it is : two terms in the U.S. House , six terms in the Senate , nearly 800 pieces of legislation introduced , thousands of votes , six books , hundreds of speeches , two presidential campaigns , seven children .\nBut is it petty to remember all the times those who praise McCain today derided him as \u201c Crazy Grandpa Warmonger \u201d ?\nA lot of us remember 2008 ; it wasn \u2019 t that long ago . Would it kill those political figures and those who covered McCain over the decades to contemplate if they were fair to the man , particularly in the 2008 presidential cycle ? Because maybe no national figure in the modern era flipped so quickly from the hero to the villain column in his media coverage and back , depending upon whether the majority of the mainstream media agreed with his stances or not .\nBack during the 2008 campaign , Chuck Schumer was telling the press , \u201c It \u2019 s John McCain who wears $ 500 shoes , has six houses , and comes from one of the richest families in his state . . . he doesn \u2019 t particularly empathize with the plight of the average person. \u201d During the Wall Street meltdown , Schumer said that McCain \u2019 s presence in Washington would only make things worse : \u201c He has not been involved except for an occasional , unhelpful statement , sort of thrown from far away , and the last thing we need in these delicate negotiations is an injection of presidential politics . \u201d\nNow Schumer tells us , \u201c He always , always had an incredible moral compass , and he spoke truth to power , \u201d and he wants to rename the Russell Senate Office building after him . What happened to the complaints about the expensive shoes ?\nYou could measure the coverage of McCain by who he was being contrasted with at that moment \u2014 against Bush in 2000 he was a hero , against Barack Obama in 2008 he was a villain , and against Trump in 2016 he was a hero again .\nBack in the late 1990s , the national media loved McCain for deviating from the Republican party line on tobacco settlements and campaign-finance reform , which would have made it more difficult for ordinary citizens to use their money to support their preferred candidates and made the exempted media coverage even more influential . But the really glowing profile pieces arrived during McCain \u2019 s 2000 campaign , and the \u201c Straight Talk Express \u201d bus , where McCain would answer questions bluntly and joke around and generally bask in the freedom that little or nothing he would say would be interpreted as a damaging gaffe . ( In 2008 , McCain was kind enough to grant me two exclusive interviews and he was funny and quotable as you would expect . )\nIn the 2000 GOP primary , most of the media quickly figured out they preferred him to George W. Bush . That year , The New Republic endorsed McCain in the Republican primaries , declaring , \u201c for the first time in recent memory , a serious Republican presidential candidate is seeking to remake his party into something other than the political arm of the privileged few . \u201d\nAfter 9/11 , McCain emerged as a strong supporter of the War on Terror and war in Iraq , and in most of the media \u2019 s eyes , McCain became just another Republican villain . Michael Moore made the \u201c loser \u201d sign at McCain during his speech at the 2004 Republican convention . By 2006 , Ezra Klein was criticizing McCain \u2019 s status as \u201c every liberal \u2019 s favorite conservative , \u201d spotlighting his \u201c wingnut bonafides. \u201d The coverage of McCain in the Bush years was predictable ; when McCain touted comprehensive immigration reform , he was a hero ; when he supported the surge , he was \u201c embracing an unpopular strategy that will make an already unpopular war longer and bloodier . \u201d\n( As we all know , the surge worked , and violence and casualties in Iraq dropped . But measuring McCain \u2019 s foreign-policy legacy is complicated by the fact that he himself concluded earlier this year , \u201c the [ Iraq ] war , with its cost in lives and treasure and security , can \u2019 t be judged as anything other than a mistake , a very serious one , and I have to accept my share of the blame for it . \u201d )\nBy 2008 , the same New Republic magazine that had once endorsed him suddenly remembered the Keating Five scandal from 1989 and suggested he should have been expelled from the Senate for it . Elsewhere in that magazine , Barron YoungSmith scoffed at any talk of McCain \u2019 s maturity and wisdom from his post-war recklessness : \u201c Given that traits exhibited at the age of fifty are reasonable indicators of character , I \u2019 ll match [ Ed ] Kilgore \u2019 s assertion that McCain \u2019 s callowness \u2018 persisted well into late-middle-age \u2019 and do him one better : Once callow , always callow. \u201d ( I don \u2019 t remember that magazine ever applying that standard to Bill Clinton , Ted Kennedy , or Barack Obama . )\nSuddenly the McCain charm and humor that reporters ate up with a spoon in 2000 was being reinterpreted as an endless series of controversial \u201c gaffes. \u201d His joke of singing \u201c bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran \u201d to the tune of Barbara Ann was seen as ipso facto evidence of anti-Muslim animus , or warmongering , or senility .\nThe 2008 general election brought a lot of profiles focusing on \u201c the dark side of John McCain \u201d with stories such as the Keating Five scandal , which for some strange reason hadn \u2019 t seemed all that newsworthy during the GOP primary eight years earlier . The media suddenly began to focus on his family \u2019 s wealth , which hadn \u2019 t been much of an issue in 2000 , either . The value of military service as preparation for the presidency , such a strong argument in the 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry , suddenly disappeared once the race became John McCain vs. Barack Obama . ( Kerry reportedly probed McCain \u2019 s interest in being his running mate several times . )\nRolling Stone assured its readers that the tale of honorable , patriotic McCain was all a myth , and that the senator was \u201c a man who has consistently put his own advancement above all else , a man willing to say and do anything to achieve his ultimate ambition : to become commander in chief , ascending to the one position that would finally enable him to outrank his four-star father and grandfather . \u201d\nIn a campaign ad , the Obama campaign mocked McCain \u2019 s age and inability to use a computer . ( Eventually , even Joe Biden called the ad \u201c terrible. \u201d ) Yet media coverage lamented that John McCain had somehow \u201c sold his soul \u201d to win the Republican nomination . The New Yorker contended McCain had \u201c betrayed his ideals . \u201d\nMcCain remained mostly in villain status through Obama \u2019 s presidency , although sometimes he could still get good coverage when contrasted with another , usually more conservative Republican . The arrival of Trump made McCain a hero again .\nMcCain was one of those men who was a joy to have as an ally and an absolute pain in the rear when you disagree . He was indeed a maverick , and that was one of the factors that made him such a challenging nominee for president ; it \u2019 s hard to unify the party when you \u2019 ve spent a significant amount of time telling other members of your party that they \u2019 re wrong . No doubt , when McCain took a position , he did it because he was convinced it was the right thing to do .
