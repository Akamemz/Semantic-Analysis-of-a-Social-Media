    "content": "Over the past few weeks , Neil deGrasse Tyson has found himself in the crosshairs of the conservative media\u2014 and , surprisingly , not without reason .\nThe controversy revolves around a quote used by Tyson in many of his public speaking engagements , which for years he has been misattributing to former President George W. Bush . According to Tyson , Bush made the following statement in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks :\nThe implication here , made explicit by Tyson , is that born-again Bush was using the events of 9/11 to malign what he saw as the false god of Islam -- when , in actuality , Tyson notes , Muslims and Christians worship the exact same deity . Not to mention that the majority of the aforementioned stars are actually named in Arabic .\nThe problem , as The Federalist first pointed out last month , is that both the quotation itself and its context were continually misstated by Tyson . Bush 's actual words -- which were not delivered shortly after 9/11 , but in 2003 , following the Columbia space shuttle disaster -- were thus :\n\u201c The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today . \u201d\nSince The Federalist first reported on the discrepancy last month , Tyson has rightly taken a lot of grief , and even grudgingly admitted that he was wrong . It 's an embarrassing admission for a man who just this year became a mainstream progressive hero in the aftermath of his successful `` Cosmos '' reboot . At the same time , it 's hard to complain that Tyson is getting a raw deal , or that he 's unfairly being maligned by right-wing journalists champing at the bit to defame a liberal icon . ( They certainly are , but that does n't mean they 're wrong . ) In truth , Tyson actually kind of deserves the dressing down -- especially when it would have been so easy to find actual examples of harebrained Islamophobia in American politics .\nBut , lest you think this controversy has been met exclusively with fair-minded analysis , the National Review 's Rich Lowry has published a piece in Politico Magazine that draws some hilariously sweeping conclusions from Tyson 's snafus .\nTitled `` The Cult of Neil deGrasse Tyson , '' Lowry 's article is actually pretty unremarkable most of the the way through . He spends much of it recapitulating the reporting already done by The Federalist , and criticizing Tyson for being so cagey throughout the episode . On page two , however , one gets the sense of Lowry trying to go in for the kill -- and that 's where things begin to go ever-so-subtly off the rails .\nYou see , Lowry explains , it is n't just that Tyson was sloppy and wrong and weirdly obdurate in the face of criticism ; it 's that this controversy is somehow emblematic of `` progressive secularism '' at large , and of the `` high priests of rationality '' who arrogantly insist that there is a scientific explanation for everything .\nTo be clear , it isn \u2019 t Tyson \u2019 s science that is the point of contention here . Who doesn \u2019 t want to listen to him talk about supernovas and the large magellanic cloud ? The problem is the belief of his fans\u2014encouraged by him\u2014that science has all the answers ; that anyone who believes in physics must adhere to a progressive secularism ; that anyone not on board is\u2014to borrow from the accusations of Tyson 's defenders\u2014guilty of anti-intellectualism , climate \u201c denial \u201d and racism .\nThere 's a lot going on in this passage , but unpacking it is illuminating : First , Lowry goes to some length to point out that he 's not casting aspersions on `` Tyson 's science , '' per se . ( And , to be fair , Lowry does n't appear to have qualms with the theoretical astrophysics that Tyson specializes in . ) But blink and you might miss the part where , mere sentences later , Lowry all but scoffs at the mention of `` climate 'denial ' , '' as if the very idea of it were somehow ridiculous now that Tyson has made a ( completely unrelated ) mistake .\nLowry 's piece is nominally about how fans of Neil deGrasse Tyson treat what he says as scripture , while unfairly imputing the worst of motives to Tyson 's ideological opponents . It 's a familiar refrain to anyone who pays attention to conservative narrative-making -- `` See ! It 's the liberals who are really the zealots ! '' -- and one that Lowry uses in his Politico article to casually introduce , and then just as quickly dismiss , progressive charges of climate denial , without ever addressing the subject head-on . Which is clever , not to mention incredibly sneaky . ( A Trojan hobbyhorse , if you will . )\nHowever , if you were curious what Lowry thinks on the matter of climate denial , you could start with this 2013 post at The National Review , in which he writes the following :\nThere are few things sadder than the \u201c climate denier. \u201d He ignores the data and neglects the latest science . His rhetoric and policy proposals are dangerously disconnected from reality . He can \u2019 t recalibrate to take account of the latest evidence because , well , he \u2019 s a denier . The new climate deniers are the liberals who , despite their obsession with climate change , have managed to miss the biggest story in climate science , which is that there hasn \u2019 t been any global warming for about a decade and a half .\nParroted often by members of the conservative press , this argument contends that theories of man-made climate change are provably fictitious , because data reveal that global warming has stopped in its tracks over the past two decades .
