One of these bombs could wipe any U.S. city off the map , with horrific casualties .\nSo Kim is now very close to having a fully capable , albeit tiny , nuclear force with global reach . All that is needed is the ability for his warheads to re-enter the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere and land on target .\nAnd we know , at least according to one report , that Kim has at least a crude capability to see his warheads survive the massive heat and wind shears to rain down atomic terror on his enemies .\nSince Kim last tested an ICBM \u2013 or any missile \u2013 in November , he has had months of lab research time to perfect even more of his nuclear weapons arsenal and missiles .\nKim may have gambled that announcing a closure of his atomic testing grounds and suspending missile and nuclear weapons tests will gain him tremendous international goodwill , a meeting with the U.S. president \u2013 and result in him losing nothing .\nKim could easily start to test missiles at any time he wishes . And he doesn \u2019 t need missiles flying all throughout Northeast Asia to perfect the targeting , guidance , command and control and heatshield technology of his nuclear delivery systems in small ways .\nPerfecting all these things could have very big results months or years down the line if Kim decides to change his mind and begin missile testing again .\nThe same goes for nuclear weapons . Just because Kim closes his nuclear testing area doesn \u2019 t mean he can \u2019 t open it back up again .
