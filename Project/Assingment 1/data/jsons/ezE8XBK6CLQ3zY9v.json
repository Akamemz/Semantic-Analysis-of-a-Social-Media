I \u2019 ve condensed the questions into a few of the most common themes :\nWhat about Warren ? As regular readers know , I have a lot of admiration for Warren and have written frequently about her . The country needs more politicians \u2014 passionate , principled and detail-oriented \u2014 like her . Over the past year , her campaign attracted an enormous amount of media attention ( contrary to complaints from some of her supporters of a # WarrenBlackout ) .\nYet once voting began , it became clear that her support was weaker than I and many others expected . She has yet to finish in the top two of any contest , and she finished behind Buttigieg , who \u2019 s since dropped out , in all of them . Her support in those early states looks typical of her nationwide support .\nIf she remains your preferred candidate and you want to vote for her , then you should by all means do so . Just know the trade-off : You \u2019 re likely sitting out the ultimate decision between Sanders and Biden . Maybe you don \u2019 t have a strong preference between them , and you \u2019 re OK with that .\nIsn \u2019 t it too early to winnow the field ? Yes and no . It certainty should be too early . The current system \u2014 with the same four unrepresentative states going first and with voters forced to select only one candidate \u2014 is madness and should be replaced .\nBut it \u2019 s na\u00efve to pretend that the current system doesn \u2019 t exist . The harsh reality is that if you choose to vote for somebody other than Biden or Sanders at this point , you are probably helping the one of those two whom you like less . If you \u2019 re torn between Bloomberg and Biden , for example , and you vote for Bloomberg , you \u2019 re helping Sanders .\nSo how can we fix this system ? The most important change would be ranked-choice voting . In that case , people could signal their support for , say , Warren by listing her first while also choosing between Biden and Sanders as the second choice . Ranked-choice voting , which several states have adopted in some form , allows long shots to emerge without similar front-runners being hurt .\nEarly states will still have disproportionate influence , so the order should change in each election cycle . Two overwhelmingly white states should not go first , and more major metropolitan areas should get to vote sooner .\nJonathan Bernstein , Bloomberg Opinion : \u201c As for Michael Bloomberg \u2026 it \u2019 s been true from the start and continues to be true that the most likely effect of his campaign is to split the mainstream liberal vote and make Sanders the nominee . \u201d\nNate Cohn , The Times \u2019 s polling expert , sees Buttigieg \u2019 s exit as good news for Biden : \u201c Many stronger Buttigieg states [ like Maine , Colorado and Utah , all of which vote Tuesday ] were also states where Biden was in jeopardy of not hitting 15 percent [ and thus winning no delegates ] . Even if his support breaks evenly , good for Biden \u2014 and it might not be even . Elsewhere , Buttigieg support is concentrated in affluent areas , where it \u2019 ll break Biden . \u201d\nMegan McArdle : \u201c I might be too pessimistic about Biden \u2019 s chances . It all feels just too close to the emotional roller coaster we # NeverTrumpers rode back in 2016 , when we spun elaborate fantasies about the field narrowing and a champion emerging to take down the Orange Menace . \u201d\nJonathan Chait : \u201c Biden was not my first , or second , or third choice . He is endlessly exasperating . But he has a quality many of the media elites have failed to see . His meandering delivery \u2014 marred with a stutter that seems to have returned in his old age after he mastered it as a young man \u2014 nonetheless manages to convey a sincerity and a decency . \u201d\nPerry Bacon Jr. , FiveThirtyEight : Buttigieg \u201c might genuinely think that Sanders would be a terrible nominee for the Democratic Party .
