( AP Photo/ Evan Vucci )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The U.S. and Iran stepped back from the brink of possible war on Wednesday as President Donald Trump signaled he would not retaliate militarily for Iran \u2019 s missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops . No one was harmed in the strikes , but U.S. forces in the region remained on high alert .\nSpeaking from the White House , Trump seemed intent on deescalating the crisis , which spiraled after he authorized the targeted killing last week of Iran \u2019 s top general , Qassem Soleimani . Iran responded overnight with its most direct assault on America since the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , firing more than a dozen missiles at two installations in Iraq . The Pentagon said Wednesday that it believed Iran fired with the intent to kill .\nEven so , Trump \u2019 s takeaway was that \u201c Iran appears to be standing down , which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world . \u201d\nDespite such conciliatory talk , the region remained on edge , and American troops including a quick-reaction force dispatched over the weekend , were on high alert . Last week Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , and Tehran \u2019 s proxies in the region remain able to carry out attacks such as the one on Dec. 27 that killed a U.S. contractor and set off the most recent round of hostilities .\nHours after Trump spoke , an \u2018 incoming \u2019 siren went off in Baghdad \u2019 s Green Zone after what seemed to be small rockets \u201c impacted \u201d the diplomatic area , a Western official said . There were no reports of casualties .\nGen. Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , warned that it was \u201c perhaps too early to tell \u201d if Iran will be satisfied that the missile strikes were sufficient to avenge the Soleimani killing .\n\u201c We should have some expectation , \u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper added in a Wednesday briefing , \u201c that Shiite militia groups , either directed or not directed by Iran , will continue in some way , shape or form to try and undermine our presence there , \u201d either politically or militarily .\nThere is no obvious path to diplomatic engagement , as Trump pledged to add to his \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign of economic sanctions . He said the new , unspecified sanctions would remain in place \u201c until Iran changes its behavior . \u201d\nIran \u2019 s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the overnight strike was not necessarily the totality of Iran \u2019 s response .\n\u201c Last night they received a slap , \u201d Khamenei said . \u201c These military actions are not sufficient ( for revenge ) . What is important is that the corrupt presence of America in this region comes to an end . \u201d\nTrump , facing perhaps the biggest test of his presidency , credited the minimized damage to an early warning system \u201c that worked very well \u201d and said Americans should be \u201c extremely grateful and happy \u201d with the outcome .\nThe strikes had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and left the world waiting to see whether the American president would respond with more military force .
