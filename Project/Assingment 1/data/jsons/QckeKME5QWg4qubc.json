But its success would be a major win for President Barack Obama , who has made climate change one of his top second-term priorities .\nOne U.S. official said he expects the deal to be approved Saturday , adding that he had n't heard about any objections to the text . `` I do n't know if anybody is going to go crazy , '' the official said .\nAnd India expressed support for the draft , significant news given the South Asian nation 's role as a major greenhouse gas polluter that had expressed skepticism about some proposals from wealthy countries . `` This is a good agreement , '' Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters , adding that Saudi Arabia and China are aboard as well .\n`` We are in the home stretch , '' French President Francois Hollande told negotiators who have spent the past two weeks gathered here in a conference center north of Paris . He added : `` Now , we are at a decisive moment in time . There \u2019 s only one relevant question and you are the only ones who can answer it : Do we want an agreement ? ''\nBut the deal got swift criticism back in the U.S. from Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders , who has pushed legislation that would cut the nation 's greenhouse gas pollution more quickly than the Obama administration has committed to in Paris .\n\u201c While this [ deal ] is a step forward it goes nowhere near far enough , '' Sanders said in a statement . `` The planet is in crisis . We need bold action in the very near future and this does not provide that . \u201d\nNegotiators were scheduled to meet at 11:30 a.m. EST to discuss the draft , which had earlier been set for 9:45 a.m .\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius hailed the final draft as a `` historic turning point , '' and green groups expressed cautious optimism , praising the text but saying the important thing will be how the countries follow through \u2014 and whether companies investing in fossil fuels get the message . `` Paris marks the beginning and not the end of the work that must be done , '' Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement .\n`` The wheel of climate action turns slowly , but in Paris it has turned , '' Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said , adding that `` this deal puts the fossil fuel industry on the wrong side of history . '' Still , the group said , `` There \u2019 s much in the text that has been diluted and polluted by the people who despoil our planet . ''\nThe African Group of countries has reservations about the text , a European source said , explaining that the coalition wants a clear mention of the needs of African nations . But the source said negotiators are confident they will be able to assuage their concerns .\nAnother source cautioned that negotiators are wary of relitigating the text . `` The general sense is no one wants to reopen the text for fear of unraveling , '' a negotiator from an island state told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe 31-page document does make a series of concessions aimed at bridging the divide between rich and poor countries , including developing countries ' demands for more ambitious action and greater levels of financial assistance from wealthier nations .\nThe legally binding portion of the text calls for limiting global warming to `` well below '' 2 degrees Celsius , compared with the temperatures that prevailed during the pre-industrial era . That 's the threshold that many scientists consider critical for heading off the worst effects of climate change . But in a win for small islands and other vulnerable countries , the draft says nations should `` pursue efforts '' to keep temperature increases to 1.5 degrees , `` recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change . ''\nThe text also sets a goal of having the world 's greenhouse gas output hit its peak `` as soon as possible , '' and of seeking `` rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science '' to find a balance between human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and those that are naturally absorbed in the second half of the century . That language , though vague , appears to indicate a goal of putting the planet on a path toward net zero emissions . But in a concession to major polluters from the developing world like China and India , the text does not specifically cite carbon `` neutrality . ''\nDeveloping countries secured a standalone article that specifically recognizes the importance of \u201c averting , minimizing and addressing \u201d the loss and damage caused by climate change , both from extreme weather events such as storms and slow-onset threats like droughts . It does not , however , make any mention of liability or compensation , which would have been a red line for the United States , U.K. and other developed countries .\nThe non-binding portion of the text urges wealthier countries to go beyond their previous pledges to mobilize $ 100 billion a year in aid for poorer nations by 2020 from public and private sources . The decision to put that language in the non-binding portion of the deal is a concession to the Obama administration , which does not want to have to submit the deal for approval by the GOP-controlled Congress .\nParts of the text would be considered legally binding under a climate treaty that the Senate ratified in 1992 . The binding portions do n't require countries to make any specific cuts in their greenhouse gas pollution , but they would commit countries to take stock of their domestic climate change plans starting in 2023 and then every five years after that . The binding language calls on countries to submit new domestic climate plans every five years , which should reflect the `` highest possible ambition . ''\nThe United States ' pledge for reducing its carbon output consists largely of actions the Obama administration has already taken , including the Environmental Protection Agency 's plan for cutting pollution from power plants .\nFabius said the document is both `` ambitious and balanced , '' and he gave a passionate speech warning negotiators to seize the moment and approve the text later Saturday after they 've had a chance to review it .\n`` The world is holding its breath . It counts on all of us , '' he said .\nThe World Wildlife Fund said the draft `` contains strong signals that would commit the world to a temperature goal that \u2019 s in line with science . '' But the group 's vice president of climate change , Lou Leonard , said more progress is still needed on other issues bedeviling the talks , including the aid question .\n`` Our biggest concern at this point is that there \u2019 s currently no guarantee of assistance for those who will suffer the most from the impacts of climate change , \u201d Leonard said .\nEven though the deal has not yet been sealed , the meeting felt like a celebration , with negotiators receiving Fabius and other top officials with raucous applause .\nTalks continued until the last minute with the U.S. and China \u2014 the world \u2019 s top two greenhouse gas polluters \u2014 trying to resolve issues around how countries should report on steps they are taking to combat climate change , and how much fossil fuel use will be permitted in the second half of the century .\nIn the hours before Saturday morning 's release , top U.S. officials including State Department climate envoy Todd Stern met behind closed doors with Chinese officials , and Obama had personally called Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday , what was supposed to have been the summit 's final day .\nLiu Zhenmin , a top Chinese official , said early Saturday that he expects the new draft to meet one major priority of China : removing language from an earlier draft that had essentially called for a halt to almost all greenhouse gas emissions during the second half of the century . Instead , Liu said , the Chinese prefer language calling for `` low-carbon development '' as the long-term goal of the deal .\nSaturday marked two weeks of mostly non-stop negotiations over what looks likely to be the first binding deal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in almost two decades . Sources from both developed and developing countries , including a bloc of 48 `` least-developed countries , '' mostly expressed optimism that the remaining sticking points had been resolved .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s going to be OK , \u201d Tony de Brum , the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday morning .\nMinisters from a new \u201c high ambition coalition \u201d of more than 100 developed countries , led by the Marshall Islands and the EU , gathered in the United Kingdom 's offices on Saturday morning and made a show of walking to the plenary together , arm in arm in the middle of a growing throng of reporters , observers , delegates and others who often broke into cheers and whistles .\nThe loose alliance , first announce Tuesday by the European Union and 79 vulnerable countries in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific , marked a turning in the negotiations by crossing the divide between wealthy and poor countries .
