Bernard Sanders captured a surprise win in the Indiana primary Tuesday , giving his campaign more fuel to fight until the Democratic National Convention in July and frustrating Hillary Clinton , who desperately wants to shift into general election mode .\nNetworks called the race by 9:10 p.m. EDT , just over two hours after the Indiana polls closed . With 84 percent of the vote counted at 10 p.m. , Mr. Sanders had 53 percent compared with 47 percent for Mrs. Clinton .\nThe Indiana win ends an impressive string of victories for Mrs. Clinton , who captured six of the past seven contests heading into Tuesday . The Sanders victory also prolongs a race that the former first lady is eager to put behind her as she turns her attention to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump .\nDespite having little realistic path to his party \u2019 s nomination , Mr. Sanders appears intent on remaining in the race to continue pushing Mrs. Clinton further left on issues such as Wall Street reform and income inequality .\nSpeaking to supporters in Louisville , Kentucky , Mr. Sanders said his message is resonating with key constituencies in the Democratic Party , and that the platform he crafted has struck a chord across the country . He gave no indication that he is taking his foot off the gas pedal anytime soon .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll tell you what is extremely exciting for me , and that is that in primary after primary , caucus after caucus , we end up winning the vote of people 45 years of age or younger , and that is important because if tells me that the ideas we are fighting for are the ideas for the future of America , and the future of the Democratic Party , \u201d Mr. Sanders said before blasting income inequality , Wall Street , college debt and other issues that have become central themes in his stump speech .\n\u201c In America today , we have millions of people working longer hours , for lower wages , \u201d he said . \u201c We have families today where mom is working 40 hours , dad is working 40 hours , the kids are working and they \u2019 re still not earning enough money to provide for their family .

Among superdelegates , she is ahead 520 to 39 .\nThere are 83 pledged delegates at stake in the Indiana primary , and the state also has nine superdelegates , seven of whom have said they will support Mrs. Clinton .\nWith such a substantial lead , Mrs. Clinton has made clear that she intends to virtually ignore attacks from the Sanders campaign and will instead focus on the general election , where she almost certainly will face Republican Donald Trump .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s chief competition , Sen.
