At least two White House aides who 've been in proximity to the president and the vice president have tested positive for COVID-19 .\nBecause of that , three key members of the Trump administration 's pandemic response team are quarantining themselves : Drs . Robert Redfield , Stephen Hahn and Anthony Fauci . Redfield is head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Hahn heads up the Food and Drug Administration and Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the nation 's top infectious disease expert .\nAll three , plus the assistant secretary for health , Dr. Brett Giroir , are slated to testify before a key Senate committee Tuesday . The hearing , which is ironically titled `` COVID-19 : Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School , '' will now be done via video conference .\nThe chair of that committee , Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander , is also self-quarantining . His office announced Sunday night that a member of the staff tested positive for COVID-19 . Alexander will chair Tuesday 's hearing from Tennessee .\nIn recent days , Alexander has said that the coronavirus testing the United States has done so far is `` not nearly enough , '' and `` there is no safe path forward to combat the novel coronavirus without adequate testing . ''\nTrump has touted the overall number of tests that have been conducted in the country \u2014 now more than 8 million . But at times he 's read a different message in them .\n`` If we did very little testing , [ America ] would n't have the most cases , '' Trump said Wednesday . `` So , in a way , by doing all of this testing , we make ourselves look bad . ''\nAnd Trump 's reservations about testing appear to be rooted in politics . Trump said Friday he believes some Democrats hope the economy does n't bounce back .\n`` I will tell you , you look at some cases , some people think they 're doing it for politics , '' Trump said on Fox News Channel . `` Here we go again . But they think they 're doing it because it 'll hurt me , the longer it takes to \u2014 hurt me in the election , the longer it takes to open up . ''\nBut Trump 's focus on how the pandemic makes him and the nation look does n't get the country closer to being prepared and able to live with the coronavirus .\n`` We have to figure out how to live with this virus , and that 's what we 're not doing , '' Michael Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , said on NBC 's Meet the Press Sunday .\nOn the White House schedule Monday : a press briefing about testing .\n1 .
