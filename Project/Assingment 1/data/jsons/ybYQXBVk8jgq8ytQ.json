But IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig offered a different picture to the Senate Finance Committee this spring . \u201c Syndicated transactions have absolutely not declined , \u201d he testified . \u201c They \u2019 re still there . \u201d\nIn November , Rettig announced an escalation \u2014 including the launch of criminal investigations \u2014 in the agency \u2019 s attempts to stymie syndicated easements . \u201c We will not stop in our pursuit of everyone involved in the creation , marketing , promotion and wrongful acquisition of artificial , highly inflated deductions based on these aggressive transactions , \u201d he said in a statement at the time . Three IRS divisions are now conducting coordinated examinations of syndication deals after identifying 125 \u201c high-risk cases , \u201d and outside contractors have been hired to assist with the investigative load . More than 80 tax court cases are now pending against partnerships that used the syndicated easement deduction .\nThe imperviousness of the scam \u2019 s promoters and investors has left tax experts flummoxed . \u201c Boy , it isn \u2019 t like the old days , when people were fearful of the IRS , \u201d said Steven Miller , who oversaw enforcement and tax-exempt organizations during his 25 years at the IRS and is now national tax director with consulting firm Alliantgroup . \u201c I \u2019 m worried people aren \u2019 t afraid of the cop on the beat any more . \u201d\nAnother IRS veteran offered a similar view . \u201c I thought by now they would have put these guys out of business , \u201d said former agency commissioner John Koskinen , who took steps against syndicated easements before he left in late 2017 . \u201c Obviously , if you can get four to seven times your investment back in deductions , that \u2019 s a good deal . But you really have to have a lot of chutzpah to pull it off . \u201d\nSome promoters continue to flaunt their sales pitches . In November , for example , an Alabama promoter ( which was not sued by the Justice Department ) solicited high net-worth clients with an ad in Barron \u2019 s , promising , in capital letters , \u201c TAX DEDUCTIONS AVAILABLE THROUGH CONSERVATION EASEMENTS\u2026100,000 INVESTED YIELDS UP TO 600,000 IN DEDUCTIONS . \u201d\nAnd sizable deals are still being struck , including by an Atlanta firm called EcoVest Capital , a chief target of the Justice Department lawsuit . According to a private placement memorandum dated Oct. 24 , which was obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , EcoVest was planning as many as three new syndicated deals on 1,549 acres in rural Calhoun County , Texas . One , touting a deduction of $ 4.10 for every $ 1 invested , was completed by year-end . ( The Justice Department suit , which is still in its early stage , asserted that EcoVest has been involved in 51 syndication easement deals since 2009 , generating $ 1.7 billion in federal tax deductions . )\nOn their face , the risk disclosures to potential investors in a syndicated deal seem daunting . For example , the private placement memo for EcoVest \u2019 s Texas offering warned of a \u201c very high likelihood that the Property Entity or the Company will be audited by the IRS . \u201d\nBut experts cite several reasons for the stubborn survival of this tax-avoidance scheme . The first is that the IRS , which Congress has starved for funding , chiefly wields its clout through individual audits and tax court cases , which invariably take years . And even the dozens of tax court cases the IRS is pursuing target only a fraction of syndicated deals .\nMore important , the syndicated deals are structured in a way that insulate the wealthy individual investors , leaving the promoters and outside lawyers to do battle with the IRS . Their fight is fueled with \u201c audit reserves \u201d of as much as $ 1 million that are set aside as part of every syndication partnership . Some deals even offer \u201c audit insurance \u201d from Lloyds of London to offset disallowed write-offs .\n\u201c The way the structure works is pretty buttoned up , \u201d Miller said . \u201c The investor sits there and doesn \u2019 t see immediate pain . You \u2019 re not going to be bothered by the IRS at the front end . Some of them say : \u2018 Well , let me do the math . What \u2019 s the likelihood of that 40 % penalty ? \u2019 That \u2019 s the calculation people are making . \u201d\nMiller believes the deterrent effect will kick in only if more cases personally target individual promoters and deal consultants with tough penalties and professional sanctions . \u201c Ultimately , \u201d he said , \u201c they need to crush a few appraisers like a grape . \u201d\nThe \u201c linchpin \u201d of the syndicated easements , Miller said , is the inflated appraisal . \u201c How do I buy something today for a dollar and magically everything I buy is truly worth $ 10 ? That belies rational thought . You just scratch your head . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s how the appraisal worked in one syndicated deal described in the Justice Department complaint . In 2015 , an EcoVest entity acquired 28 acres in North Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , for $ 1.1 million . The firm raised about $ 9 million from investors who bought the property , then made an easement donation based on a claimed value for what the land would be worth if developed as a multifamily resort . That projection , made by an appraiser hired by the promoters , produced a tax deduction of about $ 39.7 million . The tax writeoff for investors : $ 4.12 for every $ 1 invested .\nIn a written response to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s questions , an EcoVest spokesperson called the government \u2019 s charges \u201c baseless \u201d and insisted that \u201c none of the appraisals associated with EcoVest sponsored investments are abusive or fraudulent . \u201d\nOne appraiser regularly retained by EcoVest and other syndicators also looms large in the Justice Department suit : Claud Clark III , based in Magnolia Springs , Alabama . The complaint notes his involvement in at least 58 syndicated easement deals and alleges that Clark , 66 , \u201c continually and repeatedly \u201d generated \u201c grossly overvalued appraisals . \u201d\nIn January 2019 , the Alabama state real estate appraiser board brought a formal complaint against Clark , after a detailed review of one of his easement appraisals found an inflated valuation riddled with errors and omissions . Threatened with loss of his Alabama license , Clark voluntarily surrendered it in April instead . He faces a second complaint filed with state regulators in Louisiana , regarding a 2018 appraisal he did for syndicators in Jefferson Davis Parish .\nEcoVest has continued to use Clark . Its October private placement memorandum , which raised $ 19.3 million from investors , did not disclose that he had surrendered his appraisal license in his home state . ( A spokesperson for EcoVest said Clark \u2019 s relinquishment of his Alabama license wasn \u2019 t disclosed \u201c because , under securities laws , it was not material to whether Mr. Clark was authorized to issue an appraisal in Texas \u2014 a state with different appraisal rules , regulations , and practices . \u201d )\nClark did not respond to requests for comment . On Christmas Eve , however , his attorneys filed a 130-page response and counterclaim to the Justice Department complaint , denying any inflated appraisals and accusing government officials , including the IRS commissioner , Rettig , of making \u201c unlawful disclosures \u201d of appraisal information from his tax returns in public statements about the litigation .\nPromoters of syndicated conservation easements have long been at war with the supporters of traditional easements , who worry that abusive deals will prompt Congress to eliminate the tax break altogether . The traditional conservation community , embodied by the Land Trust Alliance , the Washington , D.C. , association of nonprofit land trusts , began pressing the IRS to crack down nearly a decade ago . ( Land trusts are a key part of the process : The rules for conservation easements require that any property donated to seek an easement deduction must be accepted and maintained by a land trust or government entity . ) The Land Trust Alliance later refused to accredit any trust accepting syndicated deals .\nThe IRS \u2019 attempt to crack down on syndicated easements dates back to December 2016 , when the agency took the rare step of designating profit-making syndicated easements as abusive \u201c listed \u201d transactions . The IRS demanded special paperwork identifying everyone involved in such deals \u2014 from promoters and tax advisers to appraisers and investors \u2014 and warned that continued involvement would brand them for investigations and audits .\nThe agency next took its campaign to tax court , after refusing to back down on dozens of audits rejecting the fat write-offs and demanding back taxes , interest and penalties of up to 40 % .\nBut with millions at stake , promoters have fought back fiercely . In 2016 , they formed a Washington , D.C.-based advocacy group , called Partnership for Conservation , which has spent more than $ 3 million to date on lobbyists . EcoVest has spent another $ 2.5 million .\nThe Partnership for Conservation defends the legitimacy of syndicated deals , arguing that the profit motive produces \u201c tremendous opportunities \u201d for conservation , according to Robert Ramsay , executive director of the organization . He said that the IRS should limit enforcement to cases of appraisal and valuation abuse , which he calls rare . \u201c You have to stop with the premise that all of these are egregious and over the top , \u201d Ramsay said . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s the case . \u201d\nAmong the syndicators \u2019 most fervent supporters is Robert Keller , a conservation biologist who runs the Atlantic Coast Conservancy , a land trust in Jasper , Georgia , and has accepted more syndicated easements than anyone . Keller acknowledged in an interview that his business has slowed , declining from 56 easements in 2017 to 22 in 2019 . His land trust is itself now also under IRS audit for 2014 through 2016 . ( One of the reasons for the decline in volume for Keller : Atlanta-based Ornstein-Schuler , among the most prolific syndicated-easement promoters , announced last January that it was abandoning the business , citing \u201c recent developments and the uncertainty related to the conservation and gifting of property . \u201d )\nKeller \u2019 s land trust displays the slogan \u201c Saving the world \u2014 One small piece at a time. \u201d He is unapologetic about accepting syndicated easements . \u201c For me , as a conservation biologist , this allows me to put away vast pieces of property , \u201d Keller said . \u201c I want to save the world . \u201d\nKeller asserts the campaign against syndicated easements resulted from an unholy political deal between the Land Trust Alliance and IRS . In September , he filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the IRS to force the release of correspondence between the two groups that he claims will provide smoking-gun evidence .\nRead More IRS : Sorry , but It \u2019 s Just Easier and Cheaper to Audit the Poor Congress asked the IRS to report on why it audits the poor more than the affluent . Its response is that it doesn \u2019 t have enough money and people to audit the wealthy properly . So it \u2019 s not going to .\nLand Trust Alliance CEO Andrew Bowman called the notion of such a conspiracy \u201c absurd. \u201d As he put it : \u201c Taxpayers are being bilked .
