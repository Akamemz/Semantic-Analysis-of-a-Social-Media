White nationalists claim they are important monuments \u2013 but are they just a way to rewrite an ugly history and revive the battles of the past ?\nIn St Paul \u2019 s memorial church in Charlottesville , Virginia , last Friday , just up the street from where white supremacists were gathering for a torchlight rally , Cornel West explained why African Americans saw the removal of Confederate monuments as so important .\nOn hearing that hundreds of white supremacists were gathered in a nearby park , the civil rights leader said , with a hint of weariness : \u201c These are chickens coming home to roost .

Hours later , one of their number allegedly murdered a counter-protester with his car . The next day , a planned memorial to the young woman who had been killed was shut down after \u201c credible threats \u201d from white nationalists .\nTheir stated purpose in coming to the city for the \u201c unite the right \u201d rally was to contest the removal of a statue of Lee from a downtown park . In the blizzard of online agitprop that \u201c alt right \u201d groups circulated before the event , the claim was often made that in rallying around the statue they were protecting \u201c white heritage \u201d .\nBut how did monuments to the losing side in America \u2019 s civil war become such an intense focus for a national white-supremacist movement ? And what is the heritage they really represent ?\nCharlottesville \u2019 s statue of Lee is one of about 1,500 such monuments to the Confederacy scattered throughout the US . Mostly , though not exclusively , those statues can be found in those southern states that broke from the union in 1861 over their desire to retain the system of slavery . In 1865 , after the loss of more than 600,000 lives and the destruction of entire cities such as Atlanta , the southern Confederacy was defeated , and slavery was abolished .\nBut like most of the other monuments to the confederacy \u2019 s \u201c lost cause \u201d , the statue in Charlottesville was not built in the immediate aftermath of that war . Rather , it was commissioned more than half a century later in 1917 , and erected in 1924 .\nIt was part of a wave of statue-building in the south that took place between the late 1890s and 1920 , according to research from the Southern Poverty Law Center . That wave crested in about 1911 .\nThere was another , later , flurry of statue-building in the 50s , and around this time the Confederate battle flag became a popular symbol . In that decade and the next , some southern states , such as Florida , changed their flags to more closely resemble the standard of southern defeat .\nAccording to Joseph Lowndes , a political scientist at the University of Oregon and author of two books on the US \u2019 s racial politics and the south , the timing of these enthusiasms is not accidental . \u201c The statues go up in moments of racial reaction . \u201d\nThe earlier craze was the moment when Lowndes says , \u201c the Jim Crow order was really being built in the south \u201d . So-called Jim Crow laws formally segregated public schools , public transport and public spaces generally in former confederate states . Laws mandated that black people and white people use separate restaurants , toilets and drinking fountains .\nAccording to Lowndes , the Jim Crow phenomenon was a reaction to the inroads made by the populist movement , which had fleetingly created political alliances of poor blacks and whites against the rich southern planter class .\nLowndes says that southern elites sought to \u201c take blacks out of the electorate and segregate public space \u201d in order to \u201c redivide the black and white core \u201d of the south \u2019 s working class and small farmers . The monuments were also elements of this divide-and-rule strategy . They were ultimately built for a white audience , as \u201c elements of a culture that directed whites towards beliefs that aligned them with the planters \u201d , says Lowndes . \u201c It was a political project . Any political project requires symbols , and an imaginary . \u201d\nOne of the core beliefs at the heart of the Jim Crow project \u2013 and which these laws sought to implant \u2013 was that the civil war had not been an ignominious defeat , but a noble struggle . Leonard Zeskind , activist and author of Blood and Politics , a history of white nationalism in the US , says the purpose of the hundreds of statues erected around the turn of the century was \u201c to rewrite who won the war \u201d , in order to justify Jim Crow .\nLowndes says it was in part an effort to \u201c whitewash the civil war , and the reasons it was fought \u201d . Eventually , Jim Crow was dealt a blow by the supreme court \u2019 s 1954 finding , in Brown v Board of Education , that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional . From this time , a black-led civil rights movement fought to extend the implications of this decision into the full desegregation of the south , and carried the fight into other areas such as voting rights .\nBut many whites in the south , and their state and local governments , fought tooth and nail to preserve segregation . They were , in effect , fighting the civil war all over again . In Virginia , a strategy of \u201c massive resistance \u201d devised by Senator Harry F Byrd Sr saw integrated schools defunded and schools closed , including in Charlottesville .\nAround 7 in ten working-class whites believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of 'southern pride ' rather than 'racism '\nIt was during this white resistance to civil rights that confederate symbols and statues once again became popular , and were adopted both by ordinary people and whole states , as signifiers of the resilience of white supremacy . And it was during this time that there was another surge in the number of statues erected throughout the southern states .\nLowndes says : \u201c They are presented as being part of a continuous heritage , but the idea that these symbols have anything to do with anything but racial reaction is wrong . \u201d\nNot everyone agrees with this assessment \u2013 in particular , contemporary white Americans . According to the American Values Survey by not-for-profit polling organisation PRRI , around seven in 10 working-class whites believe that the flag is a symbol of \u201c southern pride \u201d rather than \u201c racism \u201d . Sixty percent of whites of all classes feel this way , and so do 51 % of Americans as a whole \u2013 whereas 80 % of black Americans say it is a racist symbol , and it is African Americans fighting for racial justice who have been the foremost critics of confederate symbols since they were erected .\nThe great African American intellectual WEB DuBois wrote in 1931 of the grandiose inscriptions on recently erected monuments to the confederacy that : \u201c Of course , the plain truth of the matter would be an inscription something like this : \u2018 Sacred to the memory of those who fought to Perpetuate Human Slavery. \u2019 \u201d Later , Zeskind says , \u201c the memorials started to get questioned in the 1960s in the fight against Jim Crow , and its been pretty much going ever since \u201d .\nSince the 2015 massacre of nine African American churchgoers by Dylann Roof in Charleston , South Carolina , there has been a renewed focus on the persistence of confederate monuments and symbols in southern cities from racial justice advocates , including the Black Lives Matter movement . In the wake of the Charleston murders , South Carolina \u2019 s then governor , Nikki Haley , ordered the removal of the confederate flag from the grounds of the state house in Columbia . But racial justice advocates want to go further by removing all confederate relics from southern cities .\nIn Charlottesville on Friday , local Black Lives Matter chapter member Lisa Woolfork explained that for her and her fellow activists , \u201c these statues themselves are revisionist histories . They hide history . They tell a story from the 1920s of the \u2018 lost cause \u2019 . It \u2019 s a way of making the slave-holding south feel like they won . \u201d\nBut while critics of the statues have been mobilising , white nationalists have been turning the statues into rallying points for resistance to multiculturalism , feminism and minority rights . For them the fight never really stopped , and now it goes on as they rally around these symbols of the confederacy .\nLowndes says that : \u201c These were largely regional sites as late as the 1990s , \u201d of interest mostly to southern heritage groups , but also to more extremist \u201c neoconfederate \u201d groups such as the Council of Conservative Citizens , and the League of the South . ( Neoconfederates generally desire the restoration of segregation as a matter of law , and some , such as the League of the South , even want the old confederacy to once again secede . ) \u201c But they have now become national sites for a racist rightwing movement . They allow people to feel embattled . You can rally people to a last defence . \u201d\nAlexander Reid Ross is a lecturer at Portland State University , and author of Against the Fascist Creep , a broad historical survey of fascist movements to the present . He agrees that confederate monuments have at once given the \u201c alt-right \u201d a convenient set of symbols to organise around , and also swelled the constituency for radical neoconfederate groups .\n\u201c Five or 10 years ago , \u201d Ross says , \u201c there wasn \u2019 t even a big regional constituency for neoconfederates . But the increase in college organising by the \u2018 alt-right \u2019 and neo-Nazi groups has given them a new base . \u201d\nThe alleged murderer in Charlottesville last Saturday , James Fields Jr , was himself a member of a group , Vanguard America , that explicitly targets college-age men in its recruiting , and hundreds of young men were active participants in the weekend \u2019 s events . The spectacle in Charlottesville of the League of the South marching alongside neo-fascist and neo-Nazi organisations such as Vanguard America , the Traditionalist Workers Party and the National Socialist Movement demonstrates that to some extent , their objectives have fused .\nRoss says that confederate monuments are attractive to these groups partly because they represent a period of unquestioned white supremacy . \u201c The civil war is seen as the last stand of a proper , gentlemanly white tradition. \u201d But they also have value in terms of movement strategy . He compares their selection of the Lee monument in Charlottesville to the \u201c patriot movement \u201d -inspired occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016 . \u201c You place an insurrectionary point somewhere and have people rally around it . \u201d\nRebel cowboys : how the Bundy family sparked a new battle for the American west Read more\nGeorge Hawley , a political scientist at the University of Alabama , and author of two books that examine dissident rightwing movements , says that national far-right movements have been attracted to the fight over Charlottesville \u2019 s monument partly from \u201c opportunism , and a desire for controversy ... But it also comes from their sincere feeling that attacks on confederate monuments are attacks on whiteness , per se . \u201d\nHe says that the discussion around confederate monuments is indicative of the growing estrangement between a resurgent radical right , and an embattled mainstream conservatism . In the past , he says , \u201c mainstream conservative media outlets were supportive of the maintenance of confederate symbols \u201d , and did so under catchphrases such as \u201c heritage , not hate \u201d . This changed after Roof \u2019 s rampage in Charleston : establishment and so-called \u201c movement \u201d conservatives \u201c stopped defending monuments \u201d .\nOn the other hand , over the same two years , passionate defenders of confederate symbols began \u201c echoing the progressive critique of the monuments \u201d , offering \u201c a more radical pushback against the idea that it wasn \u2019 t about race \u201d . From \u201c heritage not hate \u201d , then , some moved to the admission that their heritage was hate .\nThis was perfectly timed with the rise of the \u201c alt-right \u201d . Like that broader white nationalist movement , they sought to leave behind the \u201c dog-whistling \u201d , coded talk about race that Republicans had been honing since Nixon realigned the south \u2019 s politics with his \u201c southern strategy \u201d , and openly push white supremacy .\nSouthern politicians in communities polarised around disputes over monuments sometimes try to equivocate . During the debate over the statue of General Lee in Charlottesville , Mayor Mike Signer suggested that instead of removing such statues , they could be \u201c contextualised \u201d with plaques or installations explaining the civil war and the reasons it was fought .\nWoolfork , the Black Lives Matter activist , disagrees . \u201c There is no better context for these statues than the hundreds of white nationalists coming to defend them. \u201d She says they need to go , because \u201c you can not tell beautiful lies about ugly stories \u201d .\nThere have been signs in the days since that the events in Charlottesville may have only accelerated the movement against confederate statues . In Durham , North Carolina , a group of protesters pulled down a monument dedicated in 1924 . On Tuesday night in Baltimore , hours after Trump \u2019 s incendiary press conference , the city removed four confederate memorials , including one of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson .
