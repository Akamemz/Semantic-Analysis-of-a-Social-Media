Here are the latest developments on President Donald Trump \u2019 s second high court choice , updated throughout the day :\nCapitol Police say they charged 69 people with unlawfully demonstrating during Kavanaugh \u2019 s second day of testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- a hearing that almost certainly has been the most raucous Supreme Court confirmation proceeding before the panel . Altogether , 212 people were arrested over three days of hearings , police said .\nPolice said on Thursday they removed 38 people from the hearing room after demonstrators interrupted the proceedings by shouting pro-choice slogans or calling on senators to reject Kavanaugh . Another 12 people protesting outside the room were arrested , along with 19 others who held a sit-in on the first floor of the Senate office building .\nSuch unrest is extremely rare for any hearing on Capitol Hill . Protests at the high-stakes hearing led to 73 arrests on Wednesday and 70 on Tuesday , when the hearing convened .\nThe protests may die down Friday on the hearing \u2019 s final day . Kavanaugh \u2019 s testimony will be completed , and instead the panel will hear largely from outside interest groups on both sides of confirmation .\nKavanaugh testified that he hasn \u2019 t had any \u2018 inappropriate \u201d conversations with anyone about Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation , as he faced a second day of questions from Democrats who asked if he had spoken with the White House or the law firm of President Donald Trump \u2019 s longtime lawyer .\nSenator Richard Blumenthal , a Connecticut Democrat , asked Kavanaugh if he ever discussed the Mueller probe into Russian election interference with anyone besides fellow judges at the D.C. courthouse where he serves as an appellate judge . Kavanaugh appeared exasperated , saying that the probe is a common subject of conversation among Americans .\nDemocrats remain concerned that Kavanaugh , if confirmed to the high court , could decide issues including whether Trump can be subpoenaed in Mueller \u2019 s investigation . Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he \u2019 d spoken with anyone at the White House about the probe .\n\u201c If I understand your question correctly , I haven \u2019 t had such discussions , '' Kavanaugh said . Blumenthal said Kavanaugh had `` dodged the question . ''\nThe nominee said he is acquainted with just one lawyer at the firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres , the firm of Trump \u2019 s longtime attorney Marc Kasowitz . Kavanaugh said he isn \u2019 t acquainted with Kasowitz and hasn \u2019 t discussed the investigation with Edward McNally , the lawyer he knows at the firm .\nLater , Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , one of Kavanaugh \u2019 s fiercest backers , stepped in .\n\u201c Did you make any pre-commitments or offer any hints , previews , forecasts , winks , nods or secret handshakes to the president , the vice president , the White House lawyer or anyone else in the administration or anyone at all about if and how you would rule on any matter related in any way to Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s current investigations ? \u201d Grassley asked .\nKavanaugh said he didn \u2019 t intend to suggest years ago that the Supreme Court \u2019 s 1974 Nixon tapes ruling was incorrect , even though a magazine quoted him in 1999 as saying in a lawyer roundtable that the ruling might have been `` wrongly decided . '' The decision required President Richard Nixon to turn over secret Oval Office tape recordings .\nKavanaugh said his comments published by Washington Lawyer were a response to arguments from lawyers for President Bill Clinton that an investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had weakened the presidency . Kavanaugh had worked for Starr .\n`` I said , well , we were just following U.S. v. Nixon , '' Kavanaugh said Thursday . `` My position is : Either you \u2019 re wrong or Nixon \u2019 s wrong . ''\nThe Washington Lawyer quoted Kavanaugh as saying : \u201c Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided -- heresy though it is to say so . '' He added : `` Maybe the tension of the time led to an erroneous decision . \u201d\nAs a White House staffer , Kavanaugh criticized an affirmative action program used in federal contracting as a `` naked racial set-aside , '' a newly released 2001 email shows .\nThe comment involved a program designed to direct more federal highway dollars to minority-owned contractors . At the time , the Bush administration was engaged in an internal debate over what position to take in a court fight .\nThe administration eventually took a middle ground , urging the Supreme Court to throw out a challenge to the program without reaching the substantive issues .

The committee \u2019 s Republican chairman , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , released the email Thursday along with other documents after Booker , a New Jersey Democrat , threatened to do so on his own .\nThe documents also show Kavanaugh discussing using racial profiling at airports in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . In one email , Kavanaugh describes himself as among those `` who favor effective security measures that are race-neutral . ''\nThat email left open the possibility that racial profiling could be used as an interim measure until `` a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented . ''\nKavanaugh said he suggested changes in a draft op-ed discussing the Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling for the sake of `` accuracy . '' In a 2003 email written while working in the George W. Bush White House , he questioned a passage that said legal scholars `` widely understood '' Roe to be settled law .\n`` I think it was overstating something about legal scholars , and I \u2019 m always concerned about accuracy , '' Kavanaugh testified Thursday . Under questioning from Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California , he again refused to say whether he believes Roe was correctly decided .\nAn email from Kavanaugh \u2019 s time in a Republican White House shows he questioned the accuracy of a claim that legal scholars widely accepted the Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling as settled law of the land .\n`` I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since the court can always overrule its precedent , and three current justices on the court would do so , '' Kavanaugh wrote in the 2003 email , which suggested changes to a draft opinion piece .\nThe email is within almost 200,000 pages of documents Republicans have designated as `` committee confidential , '' meaning they are available to senators but not the public .
