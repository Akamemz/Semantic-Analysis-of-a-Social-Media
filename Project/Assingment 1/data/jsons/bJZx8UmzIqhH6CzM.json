Feinstein says\nCritics say it 's overreach , with Al Gore calling it `` obscenely outrageous ''\nThat 's the question politicians in Washington , and millions of citizens around the United States , asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans ' phone records .\nFBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a British newspaper , the Guardian , published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon -- when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee . The panel 's chairman Bob Goodlatte , R-Virginia , issued a statement Thursday saying he was `` very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law , and we will investigate . ''\nThe report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee . Its chairman , Sen. Barbara Mikulski , is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate .\nWhen she read the news Thursday morning , the Maryland Democrat said , `` It was like , 'Oh , God , not one more thing ... where we 're trying to protect America and then it looks like we 're spying . ' ''\nAn author of the Patriot Act -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is `` extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act . ''\n`` These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure , '' Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R-Wisconsin , wrote in a letter to Holder .\nBut not everyone in the nation 's capital is outraged or even concerned . Some say the real travesty would be if the program , which they describe as valuable , is halted .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the Guardian story refers to a `` three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years '' -- so that while the uproar may be new , the program is not . In that time , it 's helped to disrupt `` terrorist plots '' on U.S. soil , she said .\n`` It is lawful , '' the California Democrat insisted . `` It has been briefed by Congress . ''\nRep. Mike Rogers ( R-Michigan ) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger ( D-Maryland ) , two key members of the House Intelligence Committee , both stressed that `` this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop '' and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress .\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points , adding President Barack Obama `` put in place a stronger regime of oversight '' when he took office . He further stressed the importance of ensuring `` we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists ( and to ) protect the homeland . ''\nJUST WATCHED Report : U.S. phone records go to the NSA Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report : U.S. phone records go to the NSA 01:56\n`` That is his top priority , '' Earnest said of domestic security . `` But ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people . And that is the subject of a worthy debate . ''\nIn 2006 , it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots .\n`` Verizon 's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data , local or otherwise , '' the company said at the time\nLike the FBI and the NSA , Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report . But company Vice President Randy Milch , in a note to employees , did say the newspaper 's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy .\nThe newspaper published the four-page , top-secret government order requiring `` originating and terminating '' phone numbers plus the location , time and duration of calls from the communications giant . It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19 .\nThe order applies to Verizon Business Network Services , an operation not described on the company 's website . Its scope was not immediately clear , though the Guardian claimed `` millions of U.S. customers of Verizon '' were affected by the collection of information `` regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing . ''\nIn his letter to Verizon employees , Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications `` or the name , address or financial information of a subscriber or customer . ''\nAn Obama administration official said any such order would relate `` exclusively to metadata , such as a telephone number or the length of a call . ''\nThis kind of information `` allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , '' the unnamed official said in a statement to media .\nControversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well . The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information .\nPlus , the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies -- among them Microsoft , Yahoo , Google , Facebook and Apple -- to extract e-mail , photos and other private consumer communications .\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night , saying `` they contain numerous inaccuracies . '' Specifically , he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program `` can not be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen , any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States . ''\nIn statements on that and reports about collecting phone data , Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it `` will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions . ''\nSpeaking specifically about collecting personal phone records , privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who are n't terrorists . In fact , they might not necessarily be Verizon customers , and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies .\n`` There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel , '' said the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which fights to protect privacy .\n`` It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company , meaning that , if you make calls in the United States , the NSA has those records . And this has been going on for at least seven years , and probably longer . ''\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called it `` beyond Orwellian ( in allowing ) basic democratic rights ( to be ) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies . ''\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as `` the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued : It requires no level of suspicion . ''\nMany in President Barack Obama 's own party spoke forcefully against it as well .\nThree Democratic representatives -- John Conyers of Michigan , Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia -- said the program is `` highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the '' Patriot Act .\n`` ( The revelations ) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing , indiscriminate collection of data , '' they wrote .\nSen. Mark Udall , who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee , described the program as `` the kind of government overreach I 've said Americans would find shocking . ''\n`` Is it just me , or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ? '' the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter .\nOpinions were also strong on the other side of the debate .\n`` Terrorists will come after us if they can , and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us , '' said Feinstein .\nHer intelligence committee 's ranking Republican , Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather `` significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years . ''\nFormer FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes , a CNN contributor , said that if a phone number comes up that 's linked to someone suspicious , they can go back and get information tied to that number .\n`` It 's not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers , '' Fuentes explained on CNN 's `` Starting Point . '' `` But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls . ''\nRep. Lindsey Graham said that , as a Verizon customer , `` it does n't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number . '' The South Carolina Republican said he 's confident the government wo n't monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their `` number pops up on some terrorist 's phone . ''\n`` The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic , '' he said .",
