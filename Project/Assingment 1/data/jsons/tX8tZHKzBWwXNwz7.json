    "content": "Six months ago , at the beginning of February , I wrote a column about President Obama and Mitt Romney 's being two unelectable candidates about to face off in the general election .\nThere were many unanswered questions at the time , and much has transpired since , but let 's take a look again at the equation .\nWell , different day , same story . After all these many months , we still have two unelectable candidates running against each other . If you look at historical precedents , Gov . Romney and President Obama would n't be able to win this presidential election . But because they face each other , someone has to win this very tight election .\nLet 's take a look at President Obama . According to the latest Gallup poll ratings , his approval has been stuck at roughly 47 percent for months . No incumbent president has won re-election with an approval rating consistently in the 40s . Further , Gallup rates the direction of the country , and today it has 28 percent of Americans satisfied with how things are going , and 69 percent dissatisfied . In 2004 , in that close election for President Bush , the numbers were 44 percent satisfied and 54 percent dissatisfied , a whopping net difference for President Obama of minus 31 points .\nFurther , the Consumer Confidence numbers that Bloomberg News tracks on consumer attitudes toward the economy and spending show the latest levels at minus 39.7 . A number much more akin to President George H. W. Bush . who lost re-election ( minus 42 ) , than President George W. Bush , who won re-election ( minus 5 ) .\nNow , Gov . Romney 's turn . His personal ratings in the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll show him with a net negative of minus 9 points ( 40 percent view him favorably , 49 percent view him unfavorably ) . He finished the primary season with the lowest favorability of any nominee since \u2588\u2588\u2588-Washington Post has been doing polling the past 28 years . No nominee of a major party has won the presidency with that high a negative favorability going into Election Day .\nFirst , this is some explanation for why the campaigns have conducted themselves the way they have . Neither one , it seems , can run and win on its own record or its own approval . This is why for the past few weeks , 90 percent of the television ads run by both campaigns have been negative . And this does n't seem likely to change . It seems the message from Romney is `` Fire Obama , ' and from President Obama it is , `` Do n't Hire Romney . ''\nGet more pure politics at \u2588\u2588\u2588.com/Politics and a lighter take on the news at OTUSNews.com\nSecond , the electorate is almost totally polarized at this point , with Republicans solidly backing Romney and Democrats solidly behind the president . And each side is unified in its dislike for the opposing party candidate , so there does n't look like much room to gather votes across the aisle . And so the battleground for this election will be a tiny percentage of swing voters ( roughly 5 or 6 percent ) who are either undecided or soft in their support ; meaning this seems to be an election that is likely to stay within the margin of error all the way until November , absent a major surprise or mistake .\nIn February , I speculated that this might leave room for a third party . That is no longer possible because the major-party supporters are solidly behind their candidates . And I also thought that Romney might be able to adjust the equation by unifying the Republicans . He has done so , but so has the president with Democrats . So it 's a wash .\nTwo unelectable candidates running overwhelming negative campaigns against each other will result in one 's winning and one 's losing in November , but with the winner unlike to have a mandate for governing or a vision that the public was behind . And with the results in congressional races likely to produce a Congress even more split , it certainly does n't bode well for functional governing next year .\nI hold out hope that in the next three months something will break this dynamic , and give us an opportunity to deal with the major issues in a positive way .
