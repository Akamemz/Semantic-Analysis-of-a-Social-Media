Here were five key moments:\n\n1. That awkward start\n\nOne key thing has to happen before the debate starts: the candidates have to take the stage.\n\nThat proved more complicated than usual on Saturday night, as the ABC News Republican debate began with Ben Carson refusing to walk out to his podium, even after the moderators called his name.\n\nCalled second, Carson stood and waited, allowing Ted Cruz to go out after him. Making matters weirder: Donald Trump then stopped to stand beside Carson, rather than walking out himself. Jeb Bush walked past them as he took the stage.\n\nAfter the moderators (again) called Carson, they also \"lastly\" called out Donald Trump \u2014 only to then to (seemingly) realize they still had to call out Kasich.\n\n2. Rubio targeted\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wasted no time in taking shots at Sen. Marco Rubio on Saturday night.\n\nWhen asked early on to list his accomplishments, Rubio listed policies he has supported, then turned to attacking President Obama: \"Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing,\" he said. \"He knows exactly what he's doing,\" Rubio said, by trying to make the U.S. like the rest of the world with policies like Obamacare.\n\nMarco Rubio Uses Same Line 4 Times at Debate, Even After Christie Busts Him https://t.co/0u3kMTUE3x (VIDEO) pic.twitter.com/rDmuWzZqyw \u2014 Mediaite (@Mediaite) February 7, 2016\n\nThat line would pop up again and again \u2014 and Christie noticed.\n\nIn the heated exchange that followed, Christie said that being governor meant more accountability than being a senator, saying that he had to make tougher and more important decisions than Rubio has had to as a senator. He also attacked Rubio's pattern of missing votes in the Senate, a criticism that has dogged Rubio throughout this nomination contest.\n\nRubio attacked Christie on his response to a recent snowstorm that hit New Jersey, but then pivoted again to the line about how Obama \"knows exactly what he's doing.\" Christie hit back.\n\n\"There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody,\" he said. Rubio repeated some variation of the line several times during the night.\n\nTrump leads in recent New Hampshire polls by 10 to 20 points, but Rubio has become the candidate to beat for the so-called \"establishment\" candidates, like Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Those three are fighting for survival in New Hampshire, while Rubio's numbers have surged there in the last few days.\n\n3. Trump kept a low profile\n\nEven though Trump skipped the last debate, some commentators nevertheless decided that he won. In bowing out, he garnered massive media attention, and he also avoided tough questions like those Cruz and Rubio fielded on their past immigration positions.\n\nThis debate, he showed up, and he had (what was for Trump) an unremarkable performance. He stuck to typical Trump talking points \u2014 on topics like China, job losses and America not winning anymore \u2014 and had few major tangles with his opponents.

And while Saturday's performance may not have rocketed him further ahead, it also could help hold him in first place through Tuesday's primary vote.\n\n4. Ambiguity on waterboarding (except Trump)\n\nIn a line of questioning about ISIS and foreign policy, moderator David Muir turned the conversation to an issue many Americans first encountered more than a decade ago. Pointing out that Cruz has in the past said that \"torture is wrong, unambiguously, period,\" Muir asked, \"Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?\"\n\nCruz responded that \"under the definition of torture, it's not.\"\n\nBut he was ambiguous when Muir followed up by asking if he would bring the practice back as president: \"I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use,\" he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was more forceful. Referencing \"people chopping the heads off Christians,\" he said waterboarding (and then some) would be justified.\n\n\"I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\" he said.\n\nBush, who as Muir pointed out has in the past has said he \"you won't rule waterboarding out,\" seemed to rule it out this time, saying he wouldn't bring the practice back. Instead, he said, \"what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.\"\n\nMuir finally turned to Rubio.

He then pivoted to attacking President Obama's plan to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n5. Cruz was on defense\n\nCruz, fresh off a strong victory in Iowa, found himself on the defensive immediately in Saturday night's Republican debate in Manchester, N.H. First, he was asked to answer his comments that Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be president. Cruz demurred, saying that was for the voters to decide.\n\nThen, moderators asked him to answer for voicemails, emails, and text messages that his campaign sent out on the night of the Iowa caucuses, reporting that Ben Carson was suspending his campaign.\n\nCruz, whose campaign has confirmed that it sent the messages, explained that it was based on a CNN report that Carson was \"taking a break\" after Iowa, as Cruz said, adding that CNN said it was a \"highly unusual\" move.\n\nEarlier in the week, CNN said that Cruz's characterizations of the network's reports this past week were \"false.\" And Saturday night, CNN posted a story with the headline, \"Ted Cruz is wrong about CNN's reporting.\" The network explained that CNN reporter Chris Moody tweeted on the night of the caucuses that Carson was going home to Florida, but then shortly thereafter added that Carson was not suspending the campaign.\n\nCruz apologized on stage to Carson.
