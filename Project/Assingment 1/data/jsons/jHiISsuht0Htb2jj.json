The Church Committee concluded that \u201c short of war , assassination is incompatible with American principles , international order , and morality , \u201d and in 1976 President Gerald Ford signed an executive order banning political assassinations .

Since Donald Rumsfeld termed non-state actors \u201c unlawful combatants \u201d in 2002 , the legal consensus has been that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to them .
