    "content": "Jeb Bush is in terrible shape . He 's not leading many polls , though that 's fine this early on . The problem is that his fundamentals are hideous . Trump-level hideous . And in at least one case , worse than Trump 's .\nA CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday pins Jeb Bush 's favorable rating at 35 percent compared to 57 percent who view him unfavorably . The only good news is that he 's 30 points above water among Republicans , 61 percent to 31 percent , and Republicans are the demographic that counts in a Republican primary . ( He remains underwater among Tea Party supporters , though . ) He 's way underwater among Democrats -- but also among independents , who view him unfavorably 30 percent to 62 percent .\nThen there 's ol ' Don Trump , who 's long held the position of candidate viewed most unfavorably ( though very much liked by the people who do view him favorably , hence the high national and early-state polling numbers ) . Trump 's favorability rating sits at 38 percent , with his unfavorable at 58 percent . Not that different from Bush .\nAnd then consider how each fares in a matchup with Hillary Clinton , whose favorables are n't in such great shape either . Clinton defeats Trump by six percentage points , 51 percent to 45 percent . Against Bush ? She leads by nine percentage points , 52 percent to 43 percent .\nAll of which raises some questions about what , exactly , the GOP establishment and the many , many wealthy donors who have donated to Bush see in him , expect from him . Or as the New York Times ' Nate Cohn puts it :\nJeb Bush is supposed to be the electable one . That 's why establishment donors flock to him : get him past the primary by giving his super PAC over $ 100 million , with which he can slam everyone else for as long as necessary , and then he can win the general election in a way that Cruz or Walker or Trump can not . That 's because Jeb is supposedly the most reasonable of the general election candidates , the least beholden to ideological overreach , and the one most rhetorically open-armed about wooing Hispanic voters into the Republican coalition .\nThe only problem is that the more the public sees of Jeb , the more they dislike him and the thought of him becoming president . That wretched 30-62 % figure among independents , combined with a head-to-head hypothetical in which he fares worse against Hillary Clinton than TRUMP ! does , would seem to throw the whole rationale behind the Jeb Bush campaign down the toilet .\nWhich is funny , because Jeb Bush does n't come across as nearly as much of an asshole as many of the other candidates do . He can seem mumbly or boring or stilted , but not actively malevolent . That he 's doing so poorly among independents -- and that 92 percent of independents know enough about him to have an opinion -- is likely a function of his last name . Bush hopes that the more he shows himself and explains his plans , the more he 'll be viewed as his own person . He 's not executing this plan especially well .\nThe smartest thing that Jeb Bush has done this year was convince a whole host of wealthy Republican donors and establishment operatives to get behind his candidacy early . Now that they 've invested so much into this candidate , they 're willing to stick it out well past the point at which the candidate has proven himself to be a boob .",
