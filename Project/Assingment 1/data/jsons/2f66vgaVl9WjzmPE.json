    "content": "Less than two weeks ago , President Trump \u2019 s personal attorney William Consovoy stood before a panel of federal appellate judges and told them that the president is immune from criminal investigation even if Trump shoots someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long for that panel to reject this extraordinary argument . On Monday , an unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that Trump is not immune from such investigations . The case is Trump v. Vance .\nVance arises from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance \u2019 s effort to secure many of Trump \u2019 s financial documents from Trump \u2019 s accounting firm , including his tax forms . Vance seeks these documents as part of a fairly broad-reaching criminal investigation that may ultimately implicate Trump himself , but that may also only wind up implicating some of Trump \u2019 s companies or his business associates .\nVance \u2019 s investigation is a state investigation and is entirely separate from the House impeachment inquiry . Indeed , Trump \u2019 s lawyers argued that one reason why Trump should be immune from this investigation is because it is being conducted by state officials and not the federal government .\nYet , as Chief Judge Robert Katzmann , a Clinton appointee , explains for his court , Trump \u2019 s immunity claim is especially weak because Vance seeks personal documents that are unrelated to Trump \u2019 s conduct in office . Though prior Supreme Court decisions establish that the president enjoys \u201c absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts , \u201d this case does not involve Trump \u2019 s conduct in office . Nor does it even involve an \u201c order that compels the President himself to do anything . \u201d\nThe only thing at issue here is whether Trump \u2019 s accountants must comply with a subpoena . And the court answers that question in the affirmative . \u201c While the President may be correct that state courts lack the authority to issue him orders , \u201d Katzmann writes , \u201c that provides no basis to enjoin the enforcement of a subpoena issued to a third party simply because the President is implicated in the subject matter of the investigation . \u201d\nThis decision is undoubtedly correct , at least under existing precedents . \u201c The most relevant precedent for present purposes is United States v. Nixon , \u201d Katzmann notes , a 1974 Supreme Court decision requiring President Nixon to \u201c \u2018 produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisers \u2019 for use in a criminal trial against high\u2010level advisers to the President . \u201d\nNixon involved official communications that were protected by executive privilege . And yet the Supreme Court held that Nixon must turn over those communications . Vance , by contrast , involves documents unrelated to Trump \u2019 s official duties and unprotected by executive privilege . Trump \u2019 s immunity claim in Vance , in other words , is much weaker than Nixon \u2019 s unsuccessful claim in Nixon .\nNevertheless , Trump \u2019 s lawyers have already signaled that they plan to take this case to the Supreme Court .
