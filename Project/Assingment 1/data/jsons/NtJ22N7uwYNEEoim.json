    "content": "Demonstrators from coast-to-coast boisterously -- yet for the most part peacefully -- rallied Sunday in protest of a long-awaited verdict that acquitted Floridian George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin .\nHowever , sporadic reports of vandalism trickled out of West Coast cities like Oakland , including the halt of a passenger train , the burning of American and California flags , the lighting of small fires in city roadways , shattered storefront windows and the spray painting of a courthouse , as well as the damaging of a police squad car . Protesters massed there Saturday evening just after the verdict was rendered by a six-person , all-female jury around 10 p.m . ET .\n`` I know this case has elicited strong passions . And in the wake of the verdict , I know those passions may be running even higher , '' President Obama said in a statement released Sunday . `` I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son . ''\nIn New York City , hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square on Sunday night , zigzagging through Manhattan 's streets to avoid police lines .\nSign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection , chanting `` Justice for ! Trayvon Martin ! '' as they made their way from Union Square .\nMore On This ... Protests in Oakland over Zimmerman trial verdict\nSome tempered their anger , saying they did n't contest the jury 's decision based on the legal issues involved .\nBut `` while the verdict may be legal , a system that does n't take into account what happened is a broken legal system , '' said Jennifer Lue , 24 , an Asian-American resident of Harlem .\nRev . Jacqueline Lewis told the Middle Collegiate Church congregation in Manhattan Sunday morning , `` We 're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy , '' while Baptist Pastor Jack Hakimian reportedly expressed disappointment and resignation at the Impact Miami Church in North Miami .\nIn South Florida , a wary populace awoke to relative calm Sunday , as fears of mass and violent protests proved unfounded in the face of a highly-visible police presence .\n`` I haven \u2019 t seen any evidence of problems yet , and hopefully there won \u2019 t be any , '' Ed Shohat , a Miami-Dade \u2019 s Community Relations Board member , told The Miami Herald . `` We do not believe ( violence ) will happen . Frankly , Miami is a \u2026 more mature community than \u2026 25 , 30 years ago when we had violent reactions to criminal court verdicts . ''\nMeanwhile , Mark O'Mara , who defended Zimmerman at trial , suggested his client \u2019 s safety was at risk . `` There still is a fringe element that wants revenge , '' O'Mara said . `` They wo n't listen to a verdict of not guilty . ''\nHowever , Martin supporters -- for the most part -- somberly grieved the verdict in a non-violent fashion .\nSome detractors of the verdict spoke of a lingering and ineffable sadness , which they sought to privately assuage through the comfort of family and friends . Others convened in places of worship -- and in so-called First Amendment Zones erected by authorities -- especially for peaceful demonstration .\nAt a youth service in Sanford , Fla. , where the trial was held , teens wearing shirts displaying Martin 's picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church .\nIn South Florida , Miami pastors planned to convene Sunday at 2 p.m. for a vigil at North Miami City Hall , while others awaited a second , scheduled service at 6 p.m. at the Torch of Friendship at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami , according to CBS Local in Miami .\nOvernight in Oakland , police said about 100 people protested , with some among the crowd breaking windows and starting fires in the streets . As the protest eventually fizzled , the office of police information added that it had no word of any arrests as of 2 a.m. local time .\nHowever , some Oakland marchers reportedly vandalized a police squad car , and police were -- at one point - forced to form a line to block the protesters ' path .\nThe Oakland Tribune reported some downtown office windows had been shattered , and footage from a television helicopter portrayed people starting fires in the street and spray painting anti-police graffiti . Protesters , there , also reportedly burned an American , and California state flag and spray painted Alameda County 's Davidson courthouse .\nMeanwhile , in San Francisco , raucous , yet peaceful protesters marched on the city \u2019 s Mission District neighborhood ; while about 200 in Los Angeles convened for a vigil in Leimart Park , the city \u2019 s historically black neighborhood . City News Service in Los Angeles reported at one point that a smaller group halted an Expo Line train , somewhere within the city , but police could not immediately confirm details of that account .\nLos Angeles Police Department Lt. Andy Neiman said another group of 50 to 100 demonstrators marched around midnight .\n`` There was a period where crowds were running among vehicles , but police dissuaded them , '' he reportedly said , although he added that he knew of no arrests .\nMore than 40 people gathered at City Hall in Sacramento , and the Sacramento Bee reported protesters riotously chanting : `` What do we want ? Justice . When do you we want it ? Now . For who ? Trayvon . '' Meanwhile , a banner unfurled behind the speakers read , `` No justice , no peace ! '' as the crowd cried out in unison .\nIn Florida late Saturday and into Sunday , media outlets reported mostly subdued sadness , and no violence or large gatherings .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sad , \u201d was the only response Miami Gardens barber Steve Bass could muster to the Miami Herald , when asked for his opinion regarding the verdict . Bass had reportedly cut Trayvon Martin \u2019 s hair since the teen was a toddler .\nOutside the Seminole County courthouse , where the trial took place , the Orlando Sentinel reported that a bewildered crowd of about 150 received the not-guilty verdict with chants of , `` No justice , no peace . ''\nSome civic officials weighed in , with Miami-Dade Commissioner Jean Monestime telling The Herald via email , \u201c The jury \u2019 s verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman is extremely disappointing . As a father of two boys , this case was personal . We should honor the life of Trayvon Benjamin Martin with a peaceful , non-violent response to the verdict . \u201d\nJust moments after the verdict was delivered , a Miami-Dade Police spokesman told The Herald that the department was warily watching developments across the southern Florida city .\n\u201c We \u2019 re playing it by ear , just like everybody else , \u201d Detective Javier Baez said , adding Miami police had made \u201c minor \u201d changes to its Sunday routine , ordering officers who would normally report in plain clothes to don uniforms on Sunday .\n\u201c Everyone knows to be here in town if we have to be available , \u201d Baez told The Herald .\nA court public information officer said that members of the jury had no desire to speak to the media Saturday night .

You are all that I have . At the end of the day , GOD is still in control . Thank you all for your prayers and support . I will love you forever Trayvon ! ! ! In the name of Jesus ! ! ! ''\nThe verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted . That anger appeared to return Saturday night outside the courthouse , at least for some who had been following the case .\nRosie Barron , 50 , and Andrew Perkins , 55 , both black residents of Sanford , stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept .\n`` I at least thought he was going to get something , something , '' Barron said .\nPerkins was so upset he was shaking . `` He killed somebody and got away with murder , '' Perkins shouted , looking in the direction of the courthouse . `` He ai n't getting no probation or nothing . ''\nSeveral Zimmerman supporters also were outside the courthouse , including a brother and sister quietly rejoicing that Zimmerman was acquitted . Both thought the jury made the right decision in finding Zimmerman not guilty -- they felt that Zimmerman killed Martin in self-defense .\nCindy Lenzen , 50 , of Casslebury , and her brother , 52-year-old Chris Bay , stood watching the protesters chant slogans such as , `` the whole system 's guilty . ''\nLenzen and Bay -- who are white -- called the entire case `` a tragedy , '' especially for Zimmerman .\nThe jury of six women informed Judge Debra Nelson shortly late Saturday that they had reached a verdict after deliberating for approximately 15 hours over two days .
