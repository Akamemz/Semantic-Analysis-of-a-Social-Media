Case in point : the $ 854 billion Senate spending bill making its way to the House this week .\nConsidering how large the total spending package is , you 'd think it might pay for all discretionary spending ( that 's the part of the budget that funds transportation , defense , infrastructure , education , and more ) . But it 's only a little more than 65 percent of discretionary spending for 2019 . Instead , it covers just one year of defense spending ( a Republican priority ) and the Labor , Health and Human Services and Education bill ( a Democratic one ) . As for the remaining discretionary spending , it 's provided in a smaller bill meant to fund the government through Dec. 7 .\nThe best way to describe the funding vehicle is as a political balancing act that allows Congress to , yet again , fail to deliver on its No . 1 job : passing an annual spending bill on time . Pretending this is n't how it 's been done for years now , Vermont Sen. Patrick J.
