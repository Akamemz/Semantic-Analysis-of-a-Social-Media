    "content": "Americans Really Dislike Trump , Clinton . So Why Are n't Third Parties Doing Better ?\nSo many things about this election are unprecedented \u2014 and one of the most obvious is how much voters dislike the candidates . By now , everyone knows that this year features the two most unpopular presumptive major-party candidates on record .\nBut in some ways , Americans ' dislike of the presidential candidates is n't so remarkable . In fact , a recent report from the Pew Research Center shows that 1992 voters were just as disappointed in their candidate choices , perhaps even more so , than voters are today . That helped open the door to the most successful third-party candidate ( by popular vote ) in more than 100 years , Ross Perot .\nThis year , despite constant chatter about independent candidates and new interest in the Libertarian and Green parties , no outsider candidate has looked competitive yet ( though some polls have shown Libertarian Gary Johnson polling in double-digits ) . Perot 's 1992 run is an excellent foil for showing what is making a third-party run particularly difficult this year .\nIn June 1992 , only around 40 percent of Republicans or Republican leaners were `` very '' or `` fairly '' satisfied with their choices : sitting Republican President George H.W . Bush , Arkansas Gov . Bill Clinton and businessman Perot , running as an independent .\nSo what were people so upset about ? This 1992 article from the New York Times spells it out : 78 percent of Americans disapproved of Bush 's handling of the economy .\nIndeed , the U.S. was just out of a recession , with unemployment peaking at 7.8 percent in June 1992 . And even a quote from a 1992 Bush adviser would fit perfectly into many articles about this year 's election : `` It 's clear that no matter what the economic statistics show , voters still do not feel the economy is getting better . ''\nMeanwhile , Clinton was dogged by accusations that he had avoided the draft in 1969 , as well as reports of extramarital affairs .\n1992 voters ' specific grievances with the candidates were different from those of 2016 voters , but a couple of other statistics make 1992 look a lot like 2016 . Both major-party candidates had upside-down favorability ratings : By one poll , Bush , at the end of June , had a net favorability of -15 , and Clinton was at -24 .\nAmericans were also pessimistic in general about the state of politics : Their trust of Washington was low and getting lower \u2014 29 percent of Americans in July 1992 said they trust government `` just about always '' or `` most of the time . '' As of 2015 , that figure was at 19 percent .\nIn the aftermath of the election , voter dissatisfaction for the other two candidates was understood to have opened the door for Perot , who would , come November , earn nearly 19 percent of the popular vote ( but win no states ) .\nWhat did Perot have that Gary Johnson does n't ?

Four-way polling matchups including the Green Party 's Jill Stein show that , combined , Johnson and Stein have the support of anywhere from 7 to 14 percent of registered voters .\nThat 's respectable compared with 2012 , when Johnson and Stein were also the respective Libertarian and Green nominees .

Money : The most obvious factor : Perot was able to self-fund , dumping an estimated $ 68.4 million into his campaign ( more than $ 117 million , in today 's dollars ) .
