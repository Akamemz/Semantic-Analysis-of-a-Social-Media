    "content": "Jack Phillips speaks at a press conference outside the Supreme Court after oral arguments in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , December 5 , 2017 . ( Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters )\nAt a conference in Utah , rivals in the culture war call a truce and find common ground .\nIn late June , as the United States descended into a high-combustion immigration debate marked by a degree of rancor extraordinary even for an era characterized by discord , an alternate universe quietly unfolded in which cultural-political rivals of goodwill came together to discuss an equally contentious issue : the tension between religious freedom and LGBT rights . Resuscitating such old-school notions as common ground and fairness for all , the fifth Religious Freedom Annual Review , hosted by the Brigham Young University International Center for Law and Religion Studies in Provo , Utah , gathered legal scholars , LGBT advocates , journalists , and concerned Christian , Jewish , and Muslim leaders to grapple over court cases , questions about higher education and journalistic fairness , and \u2014 surprise ! \u2014 common feelings of vulnerability .\n\u201c This is not a kumbaya attempt to paper over differences , but an effort to understand what \u2019 s at stake if we give up on the messy work of pluralism , \u201d said William Pierce , a First Amendment advocate and senior director of APCO Worldwide , a public-affairs and communications-strategy consultancy . While the mostly professional and scholarly attendees gave the event the the look of a legal convention , a few clerical collars , kippahs , rainbow stickers , and headscarves attested to the viewpoint diversity that was most evident in panels and breakout sessions . Participants offered an unusual witness both that strongly held convictions \u2014 religious , cultural , political \u2014 are not going to disappear anytime soon and that they can be reasonably debated in measured arguments free of name-calling , shout-downs , and unfriending .\nDiving into the pluralistic space in which deep differences on questions of identity , belief , and sexuality are disagreed on agreeably , Whitney Clayton , a high-ranking official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , managed in his keynote address to wow participants across the ideological spectrum . In a subsequent panel , Yale law professor and LGBT-rights advocate William Eskridge called the speech the \u201c brilliant and central point \u201d of the conference . Along with race and gender , Clayton said , \u201c faith and religious conviction are the most powerful and defining sources of personal and family identity \u201d for tens of millions of Americans .\n\u201c One can not check religious identity at the church or synagogue exit or the door of one \u2019 s home any more than one can check their race or ethnicity , \u201d Whitney argued , describing religion as much more than \u201c something to grow out of , like a childhood belief in Santa Claus. \u201d To those who believe that certain favored classes deserve special legal protections that do not extend to religious adherents , he said , \u201c I would ask you to reconsider. \u201d For many Americans , their religious identity \u201c is vastly more important and profound than race , color , ethnic origin , ethnicity , sexual orientation , education , profession , or wealth . \u201d\nHow those identities and core beliefs play out in the public square was the subject of panels on common ground . Most participants agreed that religious-freedom and LGBT advocates need not endorse each others \u2019 beliefs but that the core rights of both deserve protection in a free society . LGBT activists see their employment , housing , and other rights as tenuous in most states and worry about teen-suicide rates . Religious-freedom advocates resent having their deeply held beliefs dismissed as bigotry and are concerned about their own employment vulnerabilities , which range from being fired because of a religious affiliation to being discriminated against for attending a religious educational institution ( or , as in the recent Canadian case of the law school at Trinity Western University , having their accreditation denied for a Christian honor code ) .\nThomas Berg of the University of St. Thomas is a legal scholar who advocates for both sides . He spoke on a panel titled \u201c Finding Common Ground and the Common Good on Religious Liberty and LGBTQ Rights \u201d and made a strong case for doing just that in good-faith negotiations . For LGBT activists , protecting their rights is an existential issue , and religious observers face a demographic threat to their religious freedom : Younger voters are increasingly dedicated to a vision in which the concepts of equality and justice do not encompass one \u2019 s ability to live by traditional religious teachings and standards . All of us want to live out our identities in the public square , says Berg , and religious and LGBT communities have some parallel concerns .\nThe Utah Compromise offers core protections to religious and LGBT communities alike \u2014 a remarkable give-and-take that has not been repeated on either the local or the national level since its successful implementation three years ago .\nMany speakers and panelists despaired over the impoverishment of our society \u2019 s deeply polarized discourse . \u201c Finding common ground is where the rubber meets the road in pluralism , \u201d insisted Boston College theology professor Erik Owens , and being unable to disagree constructively bodes ill for the already ill body politic . Emma Green of The Atlantic looks to religious organizations themselves for examples of religious communities \u201c used to working out hard things among themselves. \u201d As people with Bible-based values feel more and more on the defensive , \u201c how far will it go ? \u201d she wondered . \u201c Will we even be able to talk to each other ? \u201d She , along with others , blamed the self-segregating silos of social media for some of the problem . \u201c Twitter is a nasty place , and I would suggest you never go there , \u201d she quipped .\nOn a more hopeful note for common-ground initiatives , LGBT-rights advocates and religious-freedom advocates offered heartfelt praise for the Utah Compromise of 2015 , bipartisan legislation hammered out by religious and state leaders alongside Equality Utah , an LGBT-rights advocacy group . The Utah Compromise offers core protections to religious and LGBT communities alike \u2014 a remarkable give-and-take that has not been repeated on either the local or the national level since its successful implementation three years ago . \u201c It \u2019 s not happening in other states even though the LGBT side would be wise to get help with employment and housing discrimination , \u201d said Tyler Deaton , a conservative gay-rights advocate who described meeting his husband on a Wheaton College Republican get-out-the-vote tour . Eskridge , the gay-rights advocate from Yale Law School , explained that national LGBT-rights groups don \u2019 t seem interested in building on what he regards as Utah \u2019 s \u201c deeply principled statute. \u201d However , Pierce , who specializes in finding-areas-of-agreement consulting , sees healthy conversations finally taking place in several states and thinks that they could lead to dialogue at the national level .\nIn workshops and in the second keynote address , by The Atlantic \u2019 s Green , the conference emphasized the importance of educating journalists about legal issues and the complexities and nuances involved in covering religion . But aside from NR , in this piece you \u2019 re reading now , the only outlets covering the conference were religious wire services and a local paper noted for excellence in religious-news analysis . Green and fellow journalists blamed the demise of religious-news coverage partly on falling ad revenues and editorial tendencies to prioritize sports and other departments over religion , despite religion \u2019 s being central to many news stories and crucial in many people \u2019 s lives . As pointed out by Bobby Ross Jr. , chief correspondent of the Christian Chronicle , \u201c the Dallas Morning News has multiple sports reporters and shallow religion coverage in an area where religion is tremendously important . \u201d\nTerry Mattingly , a syndicated columnist and senior fellow in media and religion at King \u2019 s College in New York , is \u201c the godfather of all religion reporting and religion news , \u201d as Green described him at one point . In a brilliant workshop titled \u201c The Seven Deadly Sins of the Religion Beat , \u201d Mattingly enumerated them :\nUse simplistic labels as often as possible ( especially \u201c fundamentalist , \u201d as a soft putdown ) .\nAssume that religion is always about politics ( instead of about bakers \u2019 and florists \u2019 inner convictions ) .\nTreat religious doctrine and tradition as mere opinions ( that can be easily discarded ) .\nBe lazy ( and settle for quotes from the same activist over and over ) .\nFocus on the most lurid examples of religious communities ( as if they were exotic tribes ) .\nAlways report on big national issues ( while ignoring overlooked and local trends that drive them ) .\nIgnore the role that religion plays in hot topics ( e.g. , Kevin Durant \u2019 s being won over not by expensive gifts proffered by multiple NBA teams but by a visit from four Golden State Warrior players who hold Bible study together ) .\nMattingly \u2019 s first point , about editorial tendencies to use simplistic labels in referring to religious communities , found traction in multiple sessions , including \u201c Religious Freedom Issues Facing American Muslims , \u201d which featured panelists including multigenerational Arab Americans and others with connections to Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and Asia . \u201c Just try putting together an Arab Student Association as I did and you \u2019 ll see we \u2019 re not a homogeneous group ! \u201d joked Sahar Aziz , a Rutgers law professor . Aziz , Haroon Azar of UCLA \u2019 s Burkle Center for International Relations , and Ossama Bahloul of the Islamic Center of Nashville all voiced concern over a range of religious-freedom issues : headscarf bans , zoning laws affecting construction of mosques , and some of the harsher rhetoric surrounding the travel ban . Muslim loyalties and affiliation remain multi-dimensional . Progressives often advocate for Muslims , recently voicing religious-freedom concerns over the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to uphold the travel ban , but Bahloul spoke for many of his co-religionists when he remarked , \u201c I \u2019 m socially conservative . We contribute to morality and religious liberty , and our young people , raised in America , without accents , should not receive questions like \u2018 Do you have a bomb under your scarf ? \u2019 \u201d\nTerry Mattingly considers the \u2018 But they hate us \u2019 response from religious communities to be immensely unhelpful . \u2018 Conservatives pay a price for hating the press , \u2019 he said . \u2018 So get a church media committee together with an articulate spokesman , and don \u2019 t be afraid to record an interview . \u2019\nMattingly and Green pointed out the complexities of most faith communities , which media often label right or left . That \u201c is not a helpful door to walk through , \u201d Green observed . \u201c Churches are much more complex , and holding these frames too tightly can trip us up. \u201d For example , \u201c the 80 percent Evangelical Trump vote is much more nuanced than that , \u201d Mattingly explained . \u201c Doctrinal and historical motivations are ignored , and also the reality that the current political system doesn \u2019 t give people a lot of options . . . which is why I voted for neither presidential candidate \u201d in 2016 . At a workshop on religious freedom and higher education , Beck A. Taylor , the president of Whitworth University , explained that \u201c as a religious institution , we appreciate some things the current administration is doing and are worried about others . We are pro-life but stand with our DACA students. \u201d Aziz insisted that \u201c it \u2019 s especially important to avoid huge generalizations about very diverse Muslim communities . People coming from Christian communities understand there \u2019 s always bad apples in any group , but they don \u2019 t apply [ that understanding ] to the less familiar Muslim community . \u201d\nAlthough faulting newsrooms for assigning inexperienced writers to cover complex religion stories and in general for failing to take the religion beat seriously enough , panelists praised the media \u2019 s coverage of the legal aspects of religion stories . Holly Hollman , general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty , said that \u201c Masterpiece Cakeshop coverage in general has been particularly good , capturing both sides of the issue. \u201d Berg led a workshop that began with what he called a \u201c half-hour whistle-stop tour of the story of American religious freedom. \u201d He focused on how the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 , which \u201c ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected , \u201d went from enjoying near-universal political and cultural support to losing that consensus in the 21st century .\nPanelists pointed out that churches need to do their part in communicating with the media . Mattingly considers the \u201c But they hate us \u201d response from religious communities to be immensely unhelpful . \u201c Conservatives pay a price for hating the press , \u201d he said . \u201c So get a church media committee together with an articulate spokesman , and don \u2019 t be afraid to record an interview. \u201d Ross of the Christian Chronicle recalled an incident that threw a 1,500-member black church \u201c with a long history of community service into a scandal over two tweets. \u201d For this and other reasons , Hollman urged , \u201c it \u2019 s important for reporters to talk to church people , and religious leaders must be willing to get out there and tell their stories . \u201d\nJournalists who cover higher education expressed their willingness to cover religious issues fairly . On a panel dealing with a range of issues \u2014 the rights of religious student groups , concerns over grant funding , concerns that religious schools have over the possibility of losing accreditation \u2014 Taylor noted that students at religious institutions can \u201c bring their whole selves into their university experience. \u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t always include religious colleges in our stories , so it \u2019 s incumbent on us to improve , \u201d Katie Mangan of the Chronicle of Higher Education admitted , adding that she \u2019 s \u201c learned a lot the last couple of days and can go into a story with more sensitivity now. \u201d When an attendee during the Q & A described pushback from a large university at which he was trying to organize a religious-freedom conference , Scott Jaschik , the editor of Inside Higher Ed , urged him to \u201c go public. \u201d \u201c Give me a call and I can ask the university for their reasoning behind the decision . \u201d\nThose who worry that the mutual respect in evidence at this conference might require the watering down of core convictions need only have attended the final day \u2019 s general session . The Reverend Eugene F. Rivers III and his wife , Jacqueline C. Rivers , were living embodiments of Clayton \u2019 s rousing keynote address on religion as a core identity . Rivers \u2019 s faith began , he said , when he was a twelve-year-old \u201c surrounded outside by dudes who wanted to kill me. \u201d Hovering inside his home , he listened to a sermon by Billy Graham ( \u201c even though he wasn \u2019 t exactly my demographic \u201d ) , accepted Jesus , and went on to major in philosophy of science at Harvard , \u201c to add intellectual depth to my testimony. \u201d After graduation , he and Jacqueline and their infant son moved to the worst section of Boston , where \u201c our high liberal friends didn \u2019 t follow us. \u201d Their house was shot at 29 times on their first night . \u201c But my well-educated wife \u2019 s religious convictions compelled her to stay , \u201d explained Rivers . \u201c She told the police , \u2018 How can we leave when others can \u2019 t ? \u2019 \u201d\nFrom there , the Riverses began transforming their community through the Boston TenPoint Coalition , which emphasizes partnership between faith communities and law enforcement . It is a model for anti-violence programs being implemented in several U.S. cities . Black churches \u201c are usually the smallest and neediest and serve the poorest and least educated , \u201c Jacqueline Rivers said . \u201c Faith-based organizations have also come together to turn around enormous crime waves. \u201d The aim is to share food and other resources , she explained , but also \u201c the most precious thing we have : our faith . \u201d\nReverend Rivers addressed the question of what religious freedom means for black Americans in light of the history of slavery . Deliverance from slavery gives religious African Americans \u201c the basis of our identity \u2014 our faith , and knowledge that God delivered us like the Israelites . White people can compartmentalize the religion alongside their money and resources , but God is the center of our lives , and Pew surveys back this up. \u201d He went on to quote Genesis 1:27 on the nature of male\u2013female complementarity , noting that \u201c we don \u2019 t need fluidity and confusion among the poor. \u201d He asked the audience for their prayers for his and his wife \u2019 s work in some of the most violent neighborhoods in our country \u2019 s cities .\nElizabeth Clark , the conference organizer and the associate director of the International Center for Law and Religion Studies at BYU Law School , related that a speaker told her after the forum had ended , \u201c This is so valuable \u2014 no one else is in this space . They should be. \u201d For Clark , the conference represents more than religious-freedom issues . \u201c These discussions illustrate what pluralism looks like in practice , \u201d she says . \u201c It \u2019 s hard and messy , and no one may end up perfectly satisfied , but it \u2019 s a crucial part of the American project . \u201d",

On a panel dealing with a range of issues \u2014 the rights of religious student groups, concerns over grant funding, concerns that religious schools have over the possibility of losing accreditation \u2014 Taylor noted that students at religious institutions can \u201cbring their whole selves into their university experience.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t always include religious colleges in our stories, so it\u2019s incumbent on us to improve,\u201d Katie Mangan of the Chronicle of Higher Education admitted, adding that she\u2019s \u201clearned a lot the last couple of days and can go into a story with more sensitivity now.\u201d When an attendee during the Q&A described pushback from a large university at which he was trying to organize a religious-freedom conference, Scott Jaschik, the editor of Inside Higher Ed, urged him to \u201cgo public.\u201d \u201cGive me a call and I can ask the university for their reasoning behind the decision.\u201d\n\nPluralism in Practice\n\nThose who worry that the mutual respect in evidence at this conference might require the watering down of core convictions need only have attended the final day\u2019s general session. The Reverend Eugene F. Rivers III and his wife, Jacqueline C. Rivers, were living embodiments of Clayton\u2019s rousing keynote address on religion as a core identity. Rivers\u2019s faith began, he said, when he was a twelve-year-old \u201csurrounded outside by dudes who wanted to kill me.\u201d Hovering inside his home, he listened to a sermon by Billy Graham (\u201ceven though he wasn\u2019t exactly my demographic\u201d), accepted Jesus, and went on to major in philosophy of science at Harvard, \u201cto add intellectual depth to my testimony.\u201d After graduation, he and Jacqueline and their infant son moved to the worst section of Boston, where \u201cour high liberal friends didn\u2019t follow us.\u201d Their house was shot at 29 times on their first night. \u201cBut my well-educated wife\u2019s religious convictions compelled her to stay,\u201d explained Rivers. \u201cShe told the police, \u2018How can we leave when others can\u2019t?\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom there, the Riverses began transforming their community through the Boston TenPoint Coalition, which emphasizes partnership between faith communities and law enforcement. It is a model for anti-violence programs being implemented in several U.S. cities. Black churches \u201care usually the smallest and neediest and serve the poorest and least educated, \u201cJacqueline Rivers said. \u201cFaith-based organizations have also come together to turn around enormous crime waves.\u201d The aim is to share food and other resources, she explained, but also \u201cthe most precious thing we have: our faith.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReverend Rivers addressed the question of what religious freedom means for black Americans in light of the history of slavery. Deliverance from slavery gives religious African Americans \u201cthe basis of our identity \u2014 our faith, and knowledge that God delivered us like the Israelites. White people can compartmentalize the religion alongside their money and resources, but God is the center of our lives, and Pew surveys back this up.\u201d He went on to quote Genesis 1:27 on the nature of male\u2013female complementarity, noting that \u201cwe don\u2019t need fluidity and confusion among the poor.\u201d He asked the audience for their prayers for his and his wife\u2019s work in some of the most violent neighborhoods in our country\u2019s cities.\n\nElizabeth Clark, the conference organizer and the associate director of the International Center for Law and Religion Studies at BYU Law School, related that a speaker told her after the forum had ended, \u201cThis is so valuable \u2014 no one else is in this space. They should be.\u201d For Clark, the conference represents more than religious-freedom issues. \u201cThese discussions illustrate what pluralism looks like in practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard and messy, and no one may end up perfectly satisfied, but it\u2019s a crucial part of the American project.\u201d",
