''\nSheyman said the performance of political progressives in turning out the vote for Democrats in the recent election gives them the right not only to be heard but also to have their demands met that entitlements be left unscathed in negotiations to avert the combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year .\nThat 's a dangerous notion , says David Walker , who as comptroller general headed the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008 and who endorsed Mitt Romney for president .\n`` I 'm concerned that liberals have misread the election and are overreaching , '' Walker said Tuesday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event .\n`` There 's actually no question that the president campaigned on more revenues and more [ sacrifice ] from the wealthy . I think it 's legitimate for him to say that , '' said Walker . `` But to say that he has more than that is not credible . And what we 're hearing right now is we 're hearing grand bargain-type numbers on revenues but not grand bargain numbers '' for entitlement reform .\nRep. Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , the second ranking House Democrat , told journalists last week that `` you 've got to put everything on the table '' in talks with Republicans .\nEven the suggestion got him in hot water , leading to social media demands for House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to oust Hoyer from leadership . Some activists urged like-minded progressives to raise their voices to get Hoyer to recant .\n`` Seniors on Medicare did not cause our deficit \u2014 Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , two wars and Wall Street 's recession did , '' a blog post on BoldProgressives.org argued . `` They should not be asked to pay through their hard-earned benefits .

He told journalists , according to The Hill :\n`` I agree that everything 's on the table , but that does n't mean we 're for everything , '' he said . `` Some of those are not advisable . ... We need to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare . ''\nProgressive groups are n't the only ones poised to give the blues to any Democratic policymaker willing to discuss entitlement reforms ; there 's also the ostensibly nonpartisan ( and powerful ) advocacy group AARP .\n`` On behalf of our 37 million members and their families , AARP will fight for an open , thoughtful public discussion about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare , and against cramming changes to these vital programs into a last\u2013minute deal that could harm all of us , '' AARP announced on its website .\nThe progressive position , as expressed by Sheyman , is that middle-class and working-class families , the hardest hit by the Great Recession , most rely on those entitlement programs and are n't in a position to make more sacrifices \u2014 unlike the top 2 percent of taxpayers .\nIf entitlement changes must be made , some progressives have floated the idea of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate pharmaceutical prices , a power Congress explicitly denied the program when it enacted the Medicare drug benefit in 2003 .
