Paris pullout : Now , US cities and states respond\nPresident Trump \u2019 s historic decision to withdraw from the Paris global climate accord has produced an extraordinary reaction from a group of US states , cities , and corporations opposed to the move . They \u2019 ve banded together in a loose coalition that intends to try and meet US greenhouse gas emission targets set by the pact , despite official Washington policy .\nDoes American leadership always reside in the White House ? That \u2019 s a question to which the US Climate Alliance \u2013 which includes the governors of at least four states , dozens of mayors , and more than 100 corporations \u2013 may provide at least a partial answer .\n\u201c I have to say , the president \u2019 s short-sightedness and just offensive breaking of a promise that this country made with the rest of the world is really inspiring others to step forward into the void of leadership that he has left , '' says Libby Schaaf , the Democratic mayor of Oakland , Calif , in a phone interview . \u201c I believe in some ways his action is going to inspire more philanthropists , more industrial leaders to come out and say , \u2018 We as Americans are not breaking our promise . \u2019 \u201d\nThere \u2019 s partisanship in this action , of course . But it is also driven by a concern on the part of many non-national officials and executives \u2013 including some Republican leaders \u2013 that the United States needs to keep its eye on building new jobs and industries around the work of adapting to a changing global environment .\n\u201c These are not tree-huggers , \u201d said Mindy Lubber , president and chief executive officer of Ceres , a sustainability advocacy group , in a phone briefing Thursday organized in support of the new coalition .\nThat said , some of the biggest names in the nascent organization are politicians long opposed to the Trump administration \u2019 s America First approach to world affairs . They include Michael Bloomberg , the former New York City mayor and billionaire , Andrew Cuomo , the Democratic governor of New York State and possible 2020 presidential candidate , and Jerry Brown , Democratic governor of California . New York and California \u2013 together with the states of Washington and Connecticut , which have also signed on \u2013 represent nearly one-quarter of America \u2019 s gross domestic product ( GDP ) .\n\u201c Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course . He \u2019 s wrong on the facts , \u201d said Governor Brown on the Thursday phone call , which was organized by the World Resources Institute .\nThe new group is trying to determine if it can submit a greenhouse-gas emission reduction goal to the United Nations alongside those submitted by almost all the world \u2019 s sovereign nations . Given the size of the California and New York economies it is possible this goal could approach the one pledged by former President Barack Obama of a 26-28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025 , measured against 2005 levels .\nIt \u2019 s the 26 percent reduction goal , itself non-binding , that Mr. Trump has said that the US will no longer take steps to meet , during his administration .\nBut politics isn \u2019 t the only reason for the new group \u2019 s formation . It also reflects the fact that many states and localities have already taken steps to try and reduce emissions , under voter and corporate pressure .\nAbout 30 states have already adopted mandates that require utilities to reduce their use of fossil fuels and increase use of renewable energy , for instance .\nCorporate leaders also see green energy as an aspect of many developing industries and possible marketing tool . They don \u2019 t want to cede leadership in this area to competitors such as China . Many lobbied Trump to stay in the Paris agreement and were unhappy when he withdrew .\n\u201c Disappointed with today \u2019 s decision on the Paris Agreement , \u201d tweeted Jeff Immelt , chairman and CEO of General Electric , following Trump \u2019 s announcement . \u201c Climate change is real . Industry must now lead and not depend on government . \u201d\nThe world is now moving in a different direction than the US on the environment , and if US companies don \u2019 t move with their global competitors they will be left behind with primitive technologies and primitive manufacturing processes that won \u2019 t match up in the years ahead , says William Rees , an ecological economist at the University of British Columbia .\nBoosting oil and gas production and attempting to revive the coal industry is 19th -century thinking , says Professor Rees . That won \u2019 t work for companies that want to maintain global market share in the 21st century .\n\u201c No corporate entity that has an international status is going to want to climb onto a 19th -century bandwagon , and that \u2019 s what Trump and his people represent , \u201d says Rees .\nMeanwhile , it is states and cities that are already being forced to deal with the realities of climate change on a practical level .
