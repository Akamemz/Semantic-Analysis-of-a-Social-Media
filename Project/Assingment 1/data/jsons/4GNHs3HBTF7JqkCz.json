But he is also keeping the door open for possible airstrikes in Syria , something that might require tacit cooperation from the Assad regime .\nThe target this time is not the Assad government , but the Islamic State , which has in the year since Obama 's last address evolved into Assad 's most formidable enemy -- as well as a threat to the Iraq government and the West .\nThe result could be Obama 's trickiest task yet in the Middle East .\nGoing after the Islamic State , or ISIS , in Syria would be a boost for Assad 's efforts to retain power . Yet the administration is trying to counteract that by aligning with moderate opposition groups .\nAccording to one White House aide , the president is seeking more aid for the rebels so they could be the ground troops in place to support potential U.S. airstrikes against ISIS . The Obama administration already is pursuing a similar strategy in Iraq , where U.S. airstrikes are backed by Iraqi security forces on the ground -- as opposed to U.S. ground troops .\nA White House aide told Fox News the president has already asked congressional leaders , with whom he met late Tuesday , to quickly pass a bill giving him the power to ramp up support to Syrian rebels .\nThe president , based on what he has told congressional leaders behind closed doors , appears unlikely to actually announce airstrikes in Syria during his address . But officials are expecting the president to give his strongest signals yet that he is moving closer to authorizing them .\nA senior official also told The New York Times Obama is willing to order airstrikes inside Syrian territory , despite warnings from Syrian president Bashar al-Assad 's government not to do so without their permission .\nAdministration officials said Obama will press forward with other elements of his plan without formal authorization from U.S. lawmakers . That could include wide-ranging airstrikes . Other elements of Obama 's plan included increased support for Iraqi security forces , as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partner nations .\nAs for aid to rebels , the White House aide told Fox News the administration has existing funds that could be used to escalate support to the Syrian rebels -- including heavy arms -- and then they would come back to Congress for more money down the road .\nThe U.S. already has been running a small CIA program to train the rebels , but Obama is seeking approval for a more overt military effort that could involve staging training locations in countries near Syria . Administration officials told the Associated Press Obama also sees a congressional authorization for a Syrian train-and-equip mission as sending a strong signal to allies who are considering similar efforts .\nSecretary of State John Kerry , meanwhile , traveled to the Middle East on Wednesday for discussions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan .\nThe Times reported that Obama will send a delegation to brief senators prior to his speech Wednesday .\nThe president huddled for nearly two hours Tuesday with the top four Congressional leaders at the White House -- House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio ; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. ; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. ; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. -- to build support for his planned campaign .
