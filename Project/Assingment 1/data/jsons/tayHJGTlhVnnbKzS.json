It also renews pressure on Beijing to enact more pro-growth measures .\n\u201c Overall it \u2019 s pretty disappointing , \u201d said Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale CIB economist Klaus Baader , who expects fourth-quarter growth of 6.8 % . \u201c Investment continued to slow pretty sharply despite efforts by the government to support the economy . It doesn \u2019 t seem to be sufficient . \u201d\nThe better-than-expected result\u2014a Wall Street Journal survey of 13 economists forecast a median 6.8 % gain\u2014is likely to renew debate over the accuracy of China \u2019 s growth statistics . Other economic data released on Monday showed disappointing results in investment and industrial production . Earlier this month , China pledged to start following a stricter global standard in calculating its data .\nEven in slowdown , China continues to grow at a pace that other major economies envy . China \u2019 s economy is nearly twice the size it was just six years ago , meaning at lower growth rates it remains a major engine for global consumption and production .\nSpeaking at an event to promote entrepreneurism in Beijing on Monday , Premier Li Keqiang said \u201c even though it was 6.9 % , it is still a growth rate of around 7 % . \u201d He said employment had improved and that innovation was helping the country restructure its economy .\nStill , the deceleration has been faster than expected by the Chinese leadership , which at times has fumbled as it tries to restructure the economy to rely more on consumer spending and services . That effort , which economists say is key to nurturing long-term growth , is making headway . But Beijing \u2019 s appetite for overhauls appears to be slowing as it moves to shore up the economy near term .\nA major challenge is demand , both at home and for exports . Xiang Yili , general manager of Wenzhou Topteam International Trade Co. , which exports stationery products , said sales at the closely held company fell 10 % in the third quarter year to year and will probably do the same in the fourth quarter . The company , based in China \u2019 s Zhejiang province , has bought more automation equipment to cut costs but the outlook remains difficult , she said .\n\u201c I think it could take two or three years for things to really improve , \u201d Ms. Xiang said .\nEconomists expect the central bank will cut interests rates at least once and further reduce banks \u2019 required reserves before the end of the year . Past efforts , including five interest-rate cuts and several rounds of reductions to the reserve level since November , have failed to reboot growth .\nDespite the slowdown , Chinese leaders haven \u2019 t backed away from the 2015 annual growth target of about 7 % . The push to reach the annual benchmark has renewed attention on the quality of Chinese statistics , adding to long-standing questions over Beijing \u2019 s methodology and whether the results are subject to political pressure .\nThe National Development and Reform Commission , China \u2019 s top planning agency , recently defended the accuracy of official data , saying that claims of inflated growth were \u201c logically wrong \u201d and \u201c unreliable. \u201d Much of China \u2019 s growth now comes from services , which aren \u2019 t as well reflected in such traditional measures as industrial production , electricity use and freight rates , it said in a recent online statement . In a separate statement , the agency said the government has plenty of options to meet the growth target .\nBeijing has approved more than 200 rail , highway , energy and sewer projects since January worth more than 1.8 trillion yuan ( $ 283.8 billion ) and urged banks to step up lending for infrastructure . Strong loan growth in September bolstered signs that the government-orchestrated spending campaign is starting to gather momentum .\nChina \u2019 s fiscal spending surged 26.9 % from a year earlier to 1.78 trillion yuan in September , it said on Monday .\nChinese leaders are also likely to heap more pressure on local officials\u2014some of whom were punished in recent months for what officials called \u201c laziness \u201d and inaction\u2014to fully spend their budgets and fast-track infrastructure projects .\nChina \u2019 s third quarter featured several policy missteps that dented growth , rattled global markets and lowered confidence in Beijing \u2019 s economic management .
