He \u2019 ll visit a Maryland town just outside Washington before traveling to the Pittsburgh suburbs . From there , he travels to Wisconsin and Tennessee on Thursday .\nThe stumping comes after the president offered a mixed message in his State of the Union address \u2013 he made clear he \u2019 ll sidestep Congress \u201c wherever and whenever \u201d he can to tackle economic issues but also lowered his sights for what is achievable at this stage in his presidency .\nIn his State of the Union address , Obama stopped short of proposing any sweeping new initiatives . He renewed his call for Congress to approve an immigration overhaul \u201c this year , \u201d but for the most part narrowed his focus to smaller-ticket items he \u2019 s vowing to do on his own .\nUrging a \u201c year of action , \u201d he pitched what he called \u201c concrete , practical proposals \u201d to boost the middle class and build \u201c new ladders of opportunity \u201d for others to enter it .\n\u201c Some require congressional action , and I \u2019 m eager to work with all of you , \u201d Obama said . \u201c But America does not stand still \u2013 and neither will I . So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families , that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m going to do . \u201d\nThe speech reflected a president struggling to advance his agenda partway through his second term , in the face of a divided Congress , flagging public support and several controversies . Instead of flatly declaring what will be achieved in 2014 , the president said \u201c let \u2019 s see \u201d where both parties can make progress .\nThematically , Obama focused his remarks on income inequality and American workers . He argued that the economic recovery largely has benefited those \u201c at the top \u201d while leaving many Americans struggling to break into the middle class .\nAdvisers had signaled ahead of the speech that the president in 2014 will rely more on executive actions to pursue portions of his agenda , with the understanding that passing anything controversial through Congress is an uphill battle . Obama took a first step in that direction on Tuesday , announcing he \u2019 ll approve an increase in the minimum wage for new federal contract workers , from $ 7.25 an hour to $ 10.10 .\nAmong the other executive actions Obama is vowing to take is a plan described as \u201c starter savings accounts. \u201d Obama said he \u2019 d launch \u201c myRA \u201d accounts to help people save for retirement \u2013 under the rough outline of the plan , the accounts would be offered , via employers , through a Roth IRA account and backed by the government . The initiatives also include a review of federal job training programs , a partnership with CEOs to help long-term unemployed , and partnerships with tech companies to improve web connectivity in the classroom .\nObama also said `` I 'll act on my own '' to streamline the bureaucracy for key infrastructure projects .\nOn gun control as well \u2013 which featured prominently in last year \u2019 s address , only to stall in Congress \u2013 Obama said he \u2019 d keep trying \u201c with or without Congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans . \u201d\nSen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , speaking on Fox News , complained afterward that Obama was taking a \u201c my way or the highway \u201d approach by saying he \u2019 d bypass Congress , sounding more like a \u201c bully \u201d than someone looking to work with lawmakers .\nBut the president would still need Congress \u2019 support for major agenda items , including an increase in the federal minimum wage for all workers , one of his top priorities .\nObama renewed that call on Tuesday night , telling Congress : \u201c Say yes . Give America a raise . \u201d\nHe further urged employers , as well as states , to raise their wages with or without Congress .\nThe president also called for Congress to extend long-term unemployment benefits , and expand the earned income tax credit for workers without children . On education , he renewed a call for Congress to help ensure universal pre-K for 4-year-olds .\nWhile some of Obama \u2019 s future executive actions may be modest in scope , House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday cautioned Obama not to overstep his bounds . \u201c We have a Constitution , \u201d Boehner said , warning that if he goes too far he \u2019 ll hit a \u201c brick wall . \u201d\nMeanwhile , in the official GOP response , Washington Rep.
