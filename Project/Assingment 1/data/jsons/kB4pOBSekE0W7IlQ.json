And it is ridiculous that Wisconsin is the first state in the union to be opened by court order \u2014 and not a unanimous order with clear legal precedent , but one based on the whims and political ideologies of just four Supreme Court justices\u2026 \u201c All four justices who overturned the governor \u2019 s power in a health emergency had campaigned against judicial activism . They proved to be against judicial activism until they were for it . They are against judges writing laws unless the special interests that put them up and backed them for office want them to write their own laws\u2026 In 1981 , as HIV and AIDS swept across the country , the Legislature gave the state Department of Health Services the power to issue emergency orders . If the Republicans who run the state Legislature don \u2019 t like those laws , they should rewrite them . \u201d Editorial Board , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\u201c The incident showed how this famously crucial state \u2019 s legal , political , and cultural differences tend to blend into a witch \u2019 s brew of polarization . If there are fresh coronavirus outbreaks in Trump Country precincts where support for business reopening is high , it could change that equation . For the time being , though , some Wisconsin citizens are getting buzzed on their inalienable right to risk illness and death. \u201d Ed Kilgore , New York Magazine\n\u201c Wisconsin law gives the state Department of Health Services extraordinarily broad power \u2014 or , at least , it did until today \u2014 to confront a public health crisis . Among other things , the department may \u2018 close schools and forbid public gatherings in schools , churches , and other places to control outbreaks and epidemics. \u2019 It may \u2018 issue orders ... for the control and suppression of communicable diseases , \u2019 and these orders \u2018 may be made applicable to the whole or any specified part of the state. \u2019 And , on top of all that , an additional provision permits the health department to \u2018 authorize and implement all emergency measures necessary to control communicable diseases \u2019 \u2026 \u201c As [ Justice Brian Hagedorn ] notes in dissent , the majority opinion \u2018 has failed to provide almost any guidance for what the relevant laws mean , and how our state is to govern through this crisis moving forward. \u2019 Wisconsin now has no stay-at-home order preventing the spread of coronavirus\u2026 And it is not at all clear which powers the state health department still has to fight the spread of a pandemic \u2026 [ Justice ] Roggensack \u2019 s opinion contains this extraordinary line : \u2018 We do not define the precise scope of DHS authority under Wis. Stat . \u00a7 252.02 ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) because clearly Order 28 went too far. \u2019 \u201d Ian Millhiser , Vox\n\u201c The Wisconsin Supreme Court decision is the legal manifestation of the anti-lockdown protests in several states , encouraged by President Donald Trump\u2026 The correct constitutional framework for evaluating government orders isn \u2019 t the made-up one that the Wisconsin court used . It \u2019 s the familiar principle that restrictions on liberty must serve a compelling government interest and must be narrowly tailored to achieving that interest . Fighting an ongoing pandemic is about as compelling as government interests get \u2026 \u201c Wisconsin law says , among other things , that DHS \u2018 may authorize and implement all emergency measures necessary to control communicable diseases. \u2019 It says that DHS \u2018 may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders \u2026 for the control and suppression of communicable diseases. \u2019 This statutory language makes it crystal clear that DHS can issue emergency orders as well as rules crafted under the required , lengthy administrative process\u2026 \u201c For good measure , Wisconsin law also says that \u2018 any rule or order may be made applicable to the whole or any specified part of the state. \u2019 That phrase pretty much rules out the majority \u2019 s position that an order magically turns into a rule when it applies statewide. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c [ Health Secretary Andrea ] Palm could order infected individuals to quarantine . But she can \u2019 t on her own direct all non-essential businesses to shut down and people to stay home without providing citizens with de minimis procedural safeguards including notice and a hearing if legislators ask . Emergency rule-making also gives the Legislature a veto . While this process could take about two weeks , Ms. Palm had plenty of time before extending her March order through May\u2026\n\u201c Mr . Evers can still work with the Legislature to promulgate a less restrictive rule that takes into account local epidemic conditions , business hygiene and social-distancing measures . Wisconsin has been less affected by the coronavirus than some Midwest states with 507 currently hospitalized compared to 1,330 in Michigan , 1,381 in Indiana and 4,473 in Illinois . Most flare-ups have been in meatpacking plants and nursing homes . Wisconsinites can be trusted to protect themselves and fellow citizens . \u201d\n\u201c Remember , the governor \u2019 s original executive order , declaring the public-health emergency and directing DHS to act as the lead agency for managing the pandemic , was not at issue in the case . Under Chapter 323 , such orders expire after 60 days unless extended by joint resolution of the legislature . Because the legislature did not pass , or even consider , such a joint resolution , the governor \u2019 s executive order expired in the second week of May ...\n\u201c So how much authority does an unelected and unconfirmed DHS secretary have under Chapter 252 ? Is it constitutional for an unelected and unconfirmed secretary to essentially have limitless authority , with no legislative oversight , while the popularly elected governor can only issue an order that runs for 60 days ? \u2026\n\u201c The governor responded [ to the ruling ] by arguing that the Republican legislature now owns the \u2018 chaos. \u2019 In fact , what will likely follow is an orderly emergency rule-making process whereby [ the Wisconsin Department of Health ] and the legislature will be forced to work in concert to establish legal guidelines for managing the reopening process\u2026 [ in the meantime ] much of the burden of providing clarity will likely fall on local units of government . Many will likely adopt a reasonable and balanced approach . But more important , as the dust settles following issuance of the order , it \u2019 s important that Wisconsinites continue to remain engaged . \u201d\n\u201c While I \u2019 m gratified to see the courts ( any court , really ) exercising some level of restraint on executive authority during a time of crisis , the way this is being done leaves several unanswered questions . On the plus side , calling for the legislature to get involved in the process is a very hopeful sign . If you \u2019 re going to temporarily curtail the rights of your citizens regarding freedom of movement and assembly , a far better approach is to pass an actual law rather than having one person dictate the rules . But with that said , the court \u2019 s ruling clearly says that they are not trying to \u2018 undermine the executive authority \u2019 of Governor Evers . Really ? It sounds as if that \u2019 s exactly what they are doing\u2026\n\u201c [ Moreover ] the executive order was described as a \u2018 vast seizure of power \u2019 \u2026 [ but ] the door has been left open for virtually the same stay at home order to be put in place if the legislature goes along with it . If the Health Services Secretary \u2019 s order was so far out of bounds , how would the same directive suddenly become lawful , valid and enforceable if it received the rubber stamp of the legislature ? \u201d",
