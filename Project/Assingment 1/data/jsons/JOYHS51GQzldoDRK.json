If anything , they fear the politics are getting worse .\nThe politics of gun rights and gun control is a hot topic on the first full day of the National Rifle Association \u2019 s three-day annual meeting , in particular the political peril involved in attacking the right to bear arms .\n\u201c Every time a Democrat starts talking about guns , they lose numbers because it is the Second Amendment , \u201d said Dave \u201c Mudcat \u201d Saunders , a Democratic strategist and lifelong gun owner . \u201c How many gun owners are there in America now ? Look it up . There is a bunch of them , and anytime you start talking about guns , you are going to take from your numbers . So there is just less talk [ about gun control ] now than there has been in forever . \u201d\nThey may not have a choice . Gun control groups , powered by potentially tens of millions of dollars from former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , vow to press the issue and force candidates to take a stand .\nIndeed , the Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety is holding an event on the sidelines of the NRA gathering at the Music City Center , with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and hundreds of gun safety advocates .\n\u201c We have been taking the fight for safer and more responsible gun laws to statehouses to Washington and corporations around the country , and that is why we are in Nashville this year , to call attention to how the NRA has been pushing dangerous legislation that hinders public safety in a number of states across the country , and we have been fighting them with some success for the first time in a long time , \u201d said Erika Soto Lamb , a spokeswoman for the group .\nThe gun control advocates will clearly be on the outside looking in on the NRA gathering , which is attracting tens of thousands of gun enthusiasts . It also is drawing most of the emerging field of likely Republican presidential hopefuls \u2014 including former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin , and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 who are expected to pledge their fidelity to the Second Amendment and to gun owners nationwide .\nNRA leaders already have begun talking with key financiers about doubling the financial resources they applied last year when they won several key races that helped tilt the Senate to Republican control , possibly having as much as $ 60 million to $ 70 million to fight a candidate like Hillary Rodham Clinton .\nThe near unity among Republicans on gun rights contrasts with the Democratic divide on the issue , underscoring how the politics appear to have swung in the GOP \u2019 s favor .\n\u201c It is a loser for the Democrats and so they shy away from it \u2014 except in Washington , D.C. , or New York , where they have a strong liberal constituency and where it is not going to cost them votingwise , \u201d said Robert A . Levy , of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute .\nDemocrats pushed gun control legislation after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , that left 20 students and six educators dead and ignited a national debate over gun ownership .\nMr. Obama pledged to use \u201c all the powers of this office \u201d to champion more restrictive polices . He also called on lawmakers to limit ammunition and semi-automatic firearms sales , and to expand background checks .\nLawmakers rejected Mr. Obama \u2019 s demands and shot down a bipartisan push from Sens . Joe Manchin III , West Virginia Democrat , and Patrick J. Toomey , Pennsylvania Republican , to expand background checks to gun shows and online sales .\nRoughly two years later , there is little indication that serious gun control legislation can pass \u2014 in particular after Republicans seized control of the Senate in the November elections .\nPublic opinion also has shifted . The Pew Research Center released a poll in December that found for the first time in two-plus decades of Pew surveys that there was more support for gun rights than gun control .\n\u201c The power of NRA and the gun lobby in Congress is formidable , \u201d Mr. Obama told ABC News this week . \u201c And you know , we \u2019 re going to keep chipping away at this , but until you get intense public demands for this , it \u2019 s probably not going to happen because some special interests and lobbyists in Washington are really , really strong and their membership feels very intensely about the issue .
