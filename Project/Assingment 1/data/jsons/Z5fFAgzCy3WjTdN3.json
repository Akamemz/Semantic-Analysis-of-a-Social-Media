    "content": "With Joe Biden on the debate stage Wednesday night , the other Democratic primary candidates will have another chance to criticize elements of his long political record . But Biden \u2019 s presence \u2014 and his wholehearted embrace of his time as second-in-command during the \u201c Obama-Biden administration \u201d \u2014 also creates an opportunity for his rivals to take on President Obama \u2019 s legacy , particularly on policies like immigration .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen a preview of what this might look like . In the first debate , Kamala Harris criticized a deportation program that operated for much of Obama \u2019 s presidency and required cooperation from local and state law enforcement , saying it allowed for the deportation of non-criminals . And more recently , Juli\u00e1n Castro said it is \u201c inevitable \u201d that Biden will have to respond to the record-breaking number of deportations that occurred on Obama \u2019 s watch . By some measures , Obama did deport more people than any other president in modern history , something for which many immigration rights advocates still criticize him . He also detained families until the courts made him stop , although his administration didn \u2019 t have a policy of family separation , as President Trump has claimed .\nDisavowing Obama \u2019 s stance on immigration is complicated for Democrats , though \u2014 and not just because the former president remains wildly popular among the party . He also issued Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , the executive order that protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation , at the end of his first term . Plus , by the end of his second term , his deportation numbers had fallen significantly , and his policies were closer to what some of the 2020 candidates are now proposing . And , of course , because Trump has adopted a harsher strategy on immigration enforcement , it has been less pressing for primary candidates to argue against Obama-era policies . But this doesn \u2019 t mean Obama \u2019 s immigration record won \u2019 t loom large over the primary . In fact , the extent to which candidates embrace Obama-era immigration policies could emerge as an important dividing line .\nObama was very tough on immigration at the beginning of his presidency\nDuring the first few years of his presidency , Obama earned the nickname \u201c deporter in chief \u201d due to the high numbers of undocumented immigrants deported during his first term . This marked a sharp contrast with the comprehensive immigration reform he had promised on the campaign trail . And over the course of Obama \u2019 s time in office , more than 3 million unauthorized immigrants were removed from the country , compared to about 2 million immigrants under President George W. Bush and less than a million under President Bill Clinton .\nBut there is some debate about how record-setting Obama \u2019 s numbers actually are , because of a trend in the type of deportations that were prioritized . A majority of the deportations that occurred during Obama \u2019 s presidency were \u201c removals , \u201d which involves a formal court order and legal consequences like ineligibility to reapply to enter the country for a certain period of time . In earlier administrations , though , the bulk of the deportations were \u201c returns , \u201d where immigrants were caught at the border and simply turned around . As you can see in the chart above , returns were much higher under Bush and Clinton than under Obama and accounted for a much larger proportion of total deportations . Obama \u2019 s deportation numbers would look less striking by comparison if returns and removals were counted together . That said , several immigration experts I spoke with said that removals are more reflective of a concerted immigration enforcement agenda , since the number of returns are tied more closely to trends at the border . So , the Obama administration still ejected a lot of people from the country in a way that made it more difficult for them to reenter .\nAnother way to gauge the relative severity of a president \u2019 s approach , according to Alex Nowrasteh , the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute , is to ignore the border altogether and look at deportations from within the United States . \u201c As far as we can tell , Obama deported more people from the interior of the U.S. than any other president in American history , \u201d Nowrasteh said . \u201c He inherited a system that was accelerating deportations and accelerated them even more. \u201d And over the course of his administration , Obama removed about 1.2 million undocumented immigrants from the heart of the country .\nThe bulk of these removals were concentrated in Obama \u2019 s first term , when his administration rapidly expanded a program that created partnerships between local and state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities \u2014 the one Harris criticized during the first debate . Under the program , any immigrant taken into state or local custody would have his immigration status checked against a federal database . If he was unauthorized , the police would hold him for additional time so federal agents could come pick him up . \u201c 2011 and 2012 were high-water marks of immigration enforcement and a good chunk of that happened through our criminal justice system , \u201d said Muzaffar Chishti , director of the Migration Policy Institute \u2019 s office at NYU School of Law . Critics argued that rather than targeting dangerous criminals for deportation , the program mostly identified low-level offenders or even people without criminal records , while scaring other undocumented immigrants out of reporting crimes .\nObama \u2019 s immigration policy shifted later in his presidency \u2014 but he was still criticized\nBut toward the end of Obama \u2019 s first term , his approach to immigration enforcement began to shift , although immigration advocates and experts are still divided about what this means for his legacy . In the summer of 2012 , facing increasing political pressure from immigrant rights groups , he issued the DACA executive order , which shielded some young undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowed them to apply for work permits . And starting in 2011 , his administration issued a series of memos that gradually narrowed the types of immigrants who were priorities for deportation , so that by the end of his second term , deportations from the interior of the country had fallen significantly .\nImmigration policy experts like Chishti think Obama deserves credit for adjusting his policies as his presidency went on . According to estimates by Chishti \u2019 s group , by the end of Obama \u2019 s presidency , as many as 87 percent of unauthorized immigrants were not priorities for removal . \u201c Interior removals fell hugely and he never got credit for that , \u201d Chishti said . Experts also told me that Obama was trying to prove to Republicans in Congress that he was tough on immigration , in the hopes that they would work with him on comprehensive immigration reform . \u201c When a legislative solution fell apart , he switched to a less punitive approach , \u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr , a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School .\nOthers are less inclined to be generous to Obama . The partnership program with state and local police didn \u2019 t end until 2014 , after a number of states and cities rebelled and tried to stop participating . ( Trump has since restarted this program , although many cities and states are resisting as part of the \u201c sanctuary city \u201d movement . ) And in response to a surge of unaccompanied migrant children and families who crossed the border in 2014 , Obama ramped up family detention until the courts made him stop \u2014 although unlike Trump , he never had a formal policy of separating families . \u201c That \u2019 s a big blemish on Obama \u2019 s record , \u201d said Bill Ong Hing , a professor of law and migration studies at the University of San Francisco . \u201c He didn \u2019 t really separate families but he definitely detained them . \u201d\nMany of the Democratic candidates have landed to the left of Obama\nTrump \u2019 s approach to immigration , which is unquestionably more punitive than Obama \u2019 s , will likely continue to dominate the primary , with the candidates eager to draw a contrast with Trump . In fact , they have almost uniformly lined up behind some Obama-era immigration policies , like DACA . But other elements of Obama \u2019 s legacy could still emerge as contentious issues among Democrats .\nOne notable area of dispute emerged during the first debate , when Castro got into a tiff with Beto O \u2019 Rourke about whether crossing the border at places other than official ports of entry should be a crime . Castro has argued that illegal border crossing should be only a civil offense , while O \u2019 Rourke says applying a criminal violation is still necessary to hold smugglers and drug traffickers accountable . And in the aftermath of the debate , Obama \u2019 s former Secretary of Homeland Security , Jeh Johnson , argued that decriminalizing illegal border crossings would be a mistake . But in her comprehensive immigration plan released in mid-July , Elizabeth Warren also expressed her support for decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings .\nOther candidates are promising broader immigration reforms \u2014 just like Obama did back in 2008 . But unlike Obama , who initially expressed reluctance to rely on executive action , many are explicitly saying they won \u2019 t rely on legislation alone to get things done . Harris , for example , has said she \u2019 ll use executive action to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation . Booker \u2019 s plan also promises to crack down on poor conditions in immigration detention facilities , which was something Obama was criticized for . A number of candidates have even rejected elements of the Obama administration \u2019 s more focused immigration priorities , saying they would only focus on violent criminals and people who pose national security threats , according to a tally by The Washington Post .\nAt this point , it \u2019 s important to emphasize that these contrasts are subtle , and candidates are mostly focusing on how they \u2019 d differentiate themselves from Trump . The call to decriminalize border crossing , for example , is a response to Trump \u2019 s use of the law to separate families . And the focus on Trump makes a lot of sense , given that Obama \u2019 s policies did become less severe over time and many of his reforms have been reversed under the Trump administration . But in a race that \u2019 s so far been led by Biden , there \u2019 s certainly fodder for a rebuke of Obama \u2019 s immigration legacy \u2014 and it could be a way for candidates like Castro to distinguish themselves in a crowded primary , or perhaps try to push the Democratic Party in a new direction on immigration .",
