Jeb Bush offered a sweeping school choice-centric education plan Monday with proposals that would allow parents to spend government dollars on the pre-K program of their choice and give college students a $ 50,000 line of credit to pay tuition .\nBush unveiled his plan on Martin Luther King Jr. Day as he fights to stay relevant in a GOP race dominated by Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , invoking education as a civil rights issue . His plan also includes allowing federal dollars for schools with many low-income students to follow a child to a new school and doubling federal support for charter schools , which are publicly funded but privately run . His campaign said the plan is budget neutral , and it would cut the federal Education Department by 50 percent , but much of what he wants would likely require congressional approval .\nThe plan echoes and builds on Bush \u2019 s time as \u201c education governor \u201d in Florida , where he oversaw the creation of some of the nation \u2019 s first school-voucher programs and was the founder of the state \u2019 s first \u2014 now-closed \u2014 charter school .\nSchool choice proposals have been widely embraced by Republicans , but charter schools are popular among some Democrats , too , even though they are widely criticized by teachers unions . Hillary Clinton has been a longtime supporter of charter schools but seemed to shift her view some in November , when she said they \u201c don \u2019 t take the hardest-to-teach kids , or , if they do , they don \u2019 t keep them . \u201d\nIn a post on Medium , Bush said his plan honors King \u2019 s legacy and that \u201c ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time . \u201d\nBush \u2019 s plan is one of the rare ones this election cycle to address in detail K-12 education , which has taken a backseat in the election , though candidates have discussed college affordability issues \u2014 Democrats in particular .

They also include ideas that have been proposed and rejected in Congress \u2014 such as allowing Title I and special education funding to follow students to another school \u2014 and ideas proposed by past GOP candidates .

He would tap into those dollars to open the door for families to pick an early childhood program that suits their needs .\nHis plan would also strengthen the D.C .
