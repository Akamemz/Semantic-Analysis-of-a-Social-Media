    "content": "President Donald Trump is , officially , off and running in pursuit of a second term in the White House .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign kickoff rally in Orlando , Florida , featured a lot of talk about freedom , a lot of talk about Hillary Clinton , and hardline immigration rhetoric . All the classics showed up : Make America Great Again . Keep America Great . Four More Years . The event was held in Trump \u2019 s strongest swing state and one of the few competitive 2020 states where he is still barely above water with voters as his campaign gets underway .\nIt was an angry speech , with Trump lashing out at the \u201c fake news \u201d media , at special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors , at Democrats , whom he portrayed as posing an existential crisis to America as Trump understands it .\n\u201c Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred , prejudice , and rage , \u201d Trump said . \u201c and want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it . \u201d\nHe dragged Clinton back into the center of his 2020 narrative ( and gave a bad impression of her to do it , one of the night \u2019 s losers ) . Everything Trump has done as president , meanwhile , was a winner , at least in his book : the best , the greatest , with the lowest unemployment and poverty rates . Any sense of perspective , on the other hand , was lost .\nLeft unsaid , of course , were Trump \u2019 s dismal approval ratings , the poor internal polling from his campaign that leaked to the media in the last week , and many of the myriad scandals that have plagued his presidency since his first day as president . Trump pushed back against the negative narratives ( especially regarding Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation ) and tried to project confidence about his reelection chances .\nThe crowd really loved it . The president was in his element . He \u2019 d regularly depart from the podium for a short walk to soak up their adulation . Trump 2020 was underway .\nHere are two winners and four losers from the speech .\nIt took Trump about 90 seconds to call out the \u201c fake news \u201d media covering his campaign kickoff .\n\u201c By the way , that is a lot of fake news back there , \u201d the president said .\nAt times , Trump sounded like he was running against the media in 2020 as much as any Democrat \u2014 and , honestly , he probably thinks about it that way . His first term has been plagued by the scandals revealed in the Mueller investigation , and in his mind , the media coverage is to blame .\n\u201c We went to the greatest witch hunt in political history , \u201d Trump said , \u201c and the only collusion was committed by the Democrats , the fake news media and their operatives and the people who funded the phony dossier : crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC . \u201d\nBut he could also turn his framing of the media as \u201c fake news \u201d to his advantage , like when he slammed \u201c career politicians \u201d for manufacturing jobs evaporating in the United States ( as opposed to , say , the automation of many production lines ) :\nThe people trying to stop our movement in Washington who spend their careers rigging the system so your losses will be there will be their game . These are the same career politicians presided over decades of flat wages , loss of our manufacturing jobs , 60,000 . Can you believe it ? Who would believe that number ? You know how I know it is true . if it wasn \u2019 t , I \u2019 ve been using it a lot . The fake news would have the headlines : Trump used the phony number . They \u2019 d have headlines . It would be the biggest story . They never corrected it , so I assume that 60,000 shuttered factories be closed up .\nTrump has gotten a lot of mileage out of convincing his supporters that most of the news they read isn \u2019 t true , still reveling in the 2016 election forecasts that predicted his loss and turned out to be wrong . The media \u2014 and a Democrat who won \u2019 t be on the ballot in 2020 but appeared in Trump \u2019 s speech more than anybody who is running \u2014 seems like Trump \u2019 s opponent in the presidential race . Neither will come out unscathed .\nIt \u2019 s not the most important thing , but for as much as Trump has attacked Hillary Clinton over the past four years , you would think he \u2019 d have a better impression of her to roll out onstage .\nTRUMP : `` This election is a verdict on whether we want to live in a country where the people will lose an election , refuse to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our Constitution and rip your country apart . '' pic.twitter.com/cU1zOtqsCB \u2014 Aaron Rupar ( @ atrupar ) June 19 , 2019\nAnyway , the real takeaway is how much Trump targeted Clinton ( and , to a lesser extent , Barack Obama ) rather than any of the Democrats actually vying to face him in 2020 . Former Vice President Joe Biden got a couple of name-checks . And the president attacked \u201c socialism \u201d broadly , with a single reference to \u201c crazy \u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders .\nBut otherwise , you could have plucked much of this speech out of 2016 .\nBy my count , President Trump has mentioned Hillary Clinton ( at least ) 7 times tonight in the span of about 30 minutes . Seven ! \u2014 Monica Alba ( @ albamonica ) June 19 , 2019\nClinton paid for the Steele dossier on Trump , he falsely claimed . She \u201c acid-washed \u201d her emails , he alleged . Over and over again , the president attacked his former opponent at the expense of any of the new faces . There was even a brief \u201c lock her up \u201d chant .\nThe Senate Republican leader wasn \u2019 t mentioned by name , but Trump bragged about appointing his 145th judge \u2014 a project prioritized by McConnell more than any other single politician . He has kept conservative judicial nominees moving through the Senate even as other legislating has been scarce .\nTrump boasted about the percentage of federal judges on the bench who would be his appointees by the time he finishes his time in office , dinging Obama for leaving so many slots open for Trump to fill . McConnell , of course , had made it his mission in the last two years of Obama \u2019 s presidency to delay the filling of any judicial openings , up to and including the Supreme Court seat for which Obama nominated Merrick Garland .\n\u201c By the time we \u2019 re finished with the rest we will have record percentages , our percentage will be a record except for one person and one person has a higher percentage than your favorite president , Donald Trump , do you know who that president is ? \u201d Trump said , painting his judicial record as historic ( and with good reason ) . \u201c His name is George Washington . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s easy to become numb to Trump \u2019 s hyperbole \u2014 it \u2019 s what makes the man , really \u2014 but look at these claims :\n\u201c We went through the greatest witch hunt in political history . \u201d\n\u201c They tried to erase your vote , erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of our country . \u201d\n\u201c We did it once and now we will do it again , and this time we will finish the job . This time should be a lot easier because we \u2019 ve done so much with our military and with our Second Amendment , with our regulations , with the biggest tax cut in history , with getting rid of so many different problems in so many different things . \u201d\n\u201c We have to come up with a theme for the new campaign . Will it be Make America Great Again , which is probably in possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics ? \u201d\n( He said several more times that MAGA \u2014 used by Ronald Reagan before him \u2014 as a political slogan was \u201c the greatest of all time . \u201d )\n\u201c The unemployment rate is the lowest rate it \u2019 s been in over 51 years . Think of that . And as I said before about African Americans , I now say also about Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country . And African American poverty has also reached by far the lowest rate in history . \u201d\n\u201c Wages are rising at the fastest rate in many decades . And really what \u2019 s nice is they \u2019 re rising the fastest for the lowest-income Americans . \u201d\n\u201c To get relief to working families , we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history , the largest . \u201d\n\u201c The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world . And something I want to make clear to the media , we have among the cleanest and sharpest \u2014 crystal clean . You \u2019 ve heard me say it . \u201d\n\u201c For the first time in half a century , we \u2019 ve reduced the price of prescription drugs . \u201d\nIt would be exhausting to try to fact-check all of these individual claims . Some of them might even be true , or close to it . But take prescription drugs , for example : Experts say what really happened is that spending on prescription drugs grew at a slower rate in 2018 than previous years . That is not the same thing as reducing drug prices .\nBut this is emblematic of how Trump also presents himself and how he will continue to do so through the upcoming campaign : Everything is the best , worst , or greatest . He \u2019 ll just hope voters are so overwhelmed that what sinks in for them is that , with Donald Trump , you will certainly get the most .\nIn this single clip , Trump promises to cure cancer , AIDS , and `` lay the foundation '' for a Mars landing -- all in his second term pic.twitter.com/aLZqbx2p3N \u2014 Aaron Rupar ( @ atrupar ) June 19 , 2019\nTrump had some kind words for his attorney general , William Barr . He actually captured a correct and important bit of nuance from the Mueller investigation \u2019 s findings : It was not the special counsel \u2019 s office that concluded Trump hadn \u2019 t committed any crimes , but instead his self-appointed top law enforcement official .\n\u201c They appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement . After two years , 1.4 million pages of documents , 500 search warrants , 500 witnesses , 200,800 subpoenas and 40 FBI agents working around the clock and what did they come up with ? No collusion , \u201d Trump told the crowd . \u201c The facts that led our great attorney general to determine no obstruction , no collusion . \u201d\nHe later insinuated that his \u201c great attorney general \u201d might still be looking around for the emails Clinton deleted a half-decade ago .\nThe policy achievement Trump can most honestly claim and , frankly , the one he seems most proud of is repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s individual mandate .\n\u201c One of the worst things anybody has ever had to live through \u2014 we \u2019 ve gotten rid of the individual mandate , \u201d Trump said .\nHow many people are happy they no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying the bad health insurance ? How many people are happy ? They are healthier . Every time you don \u2019 t have to make out a check in order to have the health care \u2014 think of that , you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay what you had to pay a lot . Now you don \u2019 t have to pay if you don \u2019 t want it , you don \u2019 t have to .\nThe Republican tax plan did repeal the mandate , though that has not been a fatal blow to the Democratic health care law that Trump promised but failed to deliver . Enrollment on the law \u2019 s marketplaces has dipped only slightly , insurer participation have been steady , and the premiums for Obamacare plans have flattened . The law isn \u2019 t working perfectly , and Trump has tried to undermine it , but it has proven resilient even under a hostile administration .\nBut a win is a win , and it sounds like Trump will be touting this one a lot as he seeks reelection .",
