    "content": "Update ( 4/19/19 ) : This post and headline have been updated to include the per-household cost estimates in AAF 's study .\nRight-wing media outlets have repeatedly asserted that the Green New Deal would come with the absurd price tag of `` $ 93 trillion '' or `` $ 94 trillion , '' uncritically repeating claims from a back-of-the-envelope , deeply flawed analysis produced by the American Action Forum , a conservative think tank . Politico recently determined that the $ 93 trillion figure was \u201c bogus , \u201d and quoted the lead author of the AAF analysis , Douglas Holtz-Eakin , admitting that he had no idea how much it would cost to implement the Green New Deal .\nAmerican Action Forum has ties to the fossil fuel industry\nThe American Action Forum , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit , and its 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) \u201c sister organization , \u201d the American Action Network ( AAN ) , have been funded by a who \u2019 s who of the polluter syndicate .\nAAN has received at least $ 250,000 from the American Petroleum Institute , a trade association for the oil industry that has donated to groups in the Koch network . And AAN has received at least $ 35,000 from the American Natural Gas Alliance , a pro-fracking gas industry trade group . Dow Chemical has given at least $ 250,000 . AAN has also been funded by other Koch-connected groups such as Americans for Job Security , Donors Trust , and the Wellspring Committee . It 's gotten money from Karl Rove 's Crossroads GPS too . AAN has in turn donated millions to AAF .\nThough some information about its funding has been made public , AAN has generally refused to disclose its donors . In 2014 , MSNBC called AAN a \u201c dark money power player , \u201d noting that it had been running numerous attack ads against Democratic candidates . FactCheck.org noted that same year that AAN has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting Republican candidates . In 2018 , a watchdog group filed suit against AAN for violating campaign finance laws and abusing its nonprofit status .\nAAF 's Green New Deal cost analysis is problematic from top to bottom\nConsidering the think tank \u2019 s connections to the fossil fuel industry , it \u2019 s not surprising that the American Action Forum \u2019 s report found the Green New Deal untenable . What is surprising is how flippant Holtz-Eakin , president of AAF and former head of the Congressional Budget Office , was about the rigor of the analysis he co-authored . When challenged about the accuracy of the report \u2019 s claim that the Green New Deal would cost some $ 93 trillion over 10 years , Holtz-Eakin told Politico , \u201c Is it billions or trillions ? Any precision past that is illusory . \u201d\nThe Green New Deal resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) and Sen. Ed Markey ( D-MA ) on February 7 is just a broad , 14-page outline of goals with no policy specifics , so determining a price tag was a fanciful exercise . AAF 's claims of a total cost of $ 51.1 trillion to $ 92.9 trillion -- up to $ 653,000 per household over a decade , or $ 65,000 per year -- have no basis in reality . As Politico reporter Zack Colman put it :\nWhen they set out to put a price tag on the Green New Deal last month , Holtz-Eakin and his associates had no real policy or plan to evaluate , so they made one up to perform back-of-the-envelope calculations . \u2026 And the AAF study does not distinguish between government and private-sector spending , nor does it attempt to quantify the benefits of reducing pollution or other policies . For example , Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor Mark Jacobson estimated that eliminating the electricity sector \u2019 s carbon emissions would avoid $ 265 billion in annual U.S. damages beginning in 2050 .\nColman also pointed out that more than $ 80 trillion of the alleged $ 93 trillion total cost would come from implementing a jobs guarantee and universal health care -- policy ideas that have no direct relation to greening the economy , even though they are in the Green New Deal resolution .\nPolitico declared that the $ 93 trillion figure is \u201c bogus \u201d -- or , in an earlier version of the article published behind a firewall , \u201c essentially vapor . \u201d\nThe fact-checking project PolitiFact also found the $ 93 trillion figure to be untrustworthy , calling it \u201c only about as strong as a clothespin in high wind. \u201d It noted that \u201c the [ AAF ] report itself is full of assumptions , qualifiers and caveats , \u201d and when a fact-checker reached out to Holtz-Eakin , the AAF president \u201c made it clear to us that the report aims to provide very rough estimates on a plan that \u2019 s only partially developed. \u201d PolitiFact rated as \u201c false \u201d this claim from Sen. Joni Ernst ( R-IA ) : \u201c At $ 93 trillion , the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789 . \u201d\nOther journalists have also pointed out major problems with the AAF analysis . Paul Blest at Splinter noted that AAF used cost estimates for a universal jobs program ( `` $ 6.8 trillion to $ 44.6 trillion '' ) and universal health care ( `` $ 36 trillion '' ) that are vastly higher than estimates produced by other think tanks . AAF also failed to account for how much money programs like universal health care could save . According to Blest :\n[ AAF 's ] ballpark estimate on a federal jobs guarantee has a range of $ 38 trillion . The centrist Brookings Institution \u2019 s estimate last year , by the way , put the high end on a job guarantee at $ 543 billion a year , or $ 5.4 trillion over 10 years . On Medicare for All , too , the AAF \u2019 s number is substantially higher than previous estimates . The libertarian Mercatus Center \u2019 s estimate set out to prove last year that Medicare for All would bankrupt the country , and inadvertently found that Medicare for All would eventually save about $ 2 trillion in national health expenditures . Even Mercatus , however , put the cost of Medicare for All at $ 32.6 trillion over 10 years .\nThe ClimateDenierRoundup column at Daily Kos pointed out another problem with AAF 's jobs-program estimates :\nThe jobs price tag is wrong because it \u2019 s double counting : many of those jobs would be created by the other parts of the GND . Improving energy efficiency and building a clean energy economy will create a lot of jobs , which are counted in the GND \u2019 s green policy price tag tally . But then AAF simply counts those jobs again in the jobs guarantee portion , as though none of those promised jobs would be used to put the green in the Green New Deal .\nGreen New Deal sponsor Markey called out major flaws in the report too , starting with the basic premise : \u201c Putting a price on a resolution of principles , not policies , is just Big Oil misinformation. \u201d Markey pointed out that AAF calculated the cost of \u201c policies that are n't even in the resolution , \u201d such as eliminating air travel :\nThe AAF analysis of the # GreenNewDeal spends some time doing basic multiplication on the impact of making all air travel unnecessary , a concept mentioned nowhere in the resolution text . https : //t.co/uFDsKLpGnt \u2014 Ed Markey ( @ SenMarkey ) February 25 , 2019\nMarkey also noted that AAF did not provide any support for its cost estimate for a low-carbon electricity grid .\nAnother example , the $ 5.4 trillion it estimates to transition our electric grid comes seemingly from thin air , as NO SOURCES are documented for their generation cost assumptions . https : //t.co/RxkcxLrOPE \u2014 Ed Markey ( @ SenMarkey ) February 25 , 2019\nAs The New York Times recently put it , \u201c For now it \u2019 s impossible to pin down dollar figures on the plan. \u201d FactCheck.org agreed , writing that \u201c the experts we spoke to said it \u2019 s not possible to put a specific price tag on the Green New Deal . \u201d\nPerhaps most egregiously , AAF \u2019 s analysis of the Green New Deal completely ignored the enormous cost of not fighting climate change . Just last year , climate disasters and extreme weather events cost the U.S. an estimated $ 91 billion . According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a 1.5 C rise in the global average temperature would cost $ 54 trillion . Things only get more expensive ( and catastrophic ) from there . According to Axios :\nYou think $ 54 trillion is a lot ? That number comes from research that also says that a 2.0\u00b0C increase will cause $ 69 trillion of damage , and a 3.7\u00b0C increase will cause a stunning $ 551 trillion in damage . $ 551 trillion is more than all the wealth currently existing in the world , which gives an indication of just how much richer humanity could become if we do n't first destroy our planet .\nCurrent policies in place around the world have us on track for about 3.3 C of warming by 2100 if we do n't dramatically change course .\nAAF 's analysis also ignored the significant economic benefits that would come from taking addressing climate change . \u201c Bold climate action could deliver at least US $ 26 trillion in economic benefits through to 2030 , compared with business-as-usual , \u201d according to a recent report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate .\nFox News and other right-wing outlets have been hyping the $ 93 trillion figure\nRight-wing media have been heavily citing the AAF report since its release on February 25 -- and they have often used the $ 93 trillion figure without noting that it 's at the top end of a range AAF provided . Fox News has been particularly eager to amplify the huge estimate . Hosts and guests have cited price tags between $ 91 trillion and $ 94 trillion on Fox News shows including Fox & Friends , The Greg Gutfeld Show , and Watters \u2019 World , and on Fox Business Network shows including Varney & Co. , Trish Regan Primetime , Making Money with Charles Payne , and Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo . Sean Hannity has cited the AAF report at least three times on his Fox News show . He typified Fox 's incurious reporting on AAF \u2019 s analysis during the March 5 episode of Hannity :\nSEAN HANNITY ( HOST ) : They are going to eliminate fossil fuels , gas , and oil . They 're going to destroy the lifeblood of our economy . They 're going to get rid of planes , mandate you rebuild your home . Who 's paying for that ? The estimates now are as high as $ 94 trillion in 10 years -- that 's their proposal .\nMany other right-wing media outlets have also uncritically amplified AAF 's enormous estimate , including The Daily Caller , The Daily Wire , and the Washington Free Beacon .\nSome Republican politicians such as Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso have also latched onto the $ 93 trillion estimate and publicized it through mainstream and right-wing media . Barrasso issued a press release with the figure , wrote an opinion piece about it for USA Today , and made an appearance on Fox News to promote it . During Barrasso \u2019 s interview on Fox 's America 's Newsroom , co-host Sandra Smith falsely claimed that \u201c the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u201d was behind the $ 93 trillion figure and Barrasso failed to correct her error . ( Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt also falsely credited the report to the CBO . ) From the February 28 episode of America \u2019 s Newsroom :\nSANDRA SMITH ( HOST ) : The Green New Deal , all the rage on the left . But a new study finds that it comes with a staggering price tag : the plan estimated to cost is as much as $ 93 trillion . That breaks down to $ 600,000 per household . Those are some big numbers . Joining us now , Sen. John Barrasso , a Republican from Wyoming who chairs the Committee on the Environment and Public Works . Been hearing you talk a lot about this , sir , and this price tag . It is a lofty one . This is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that did a study on this and came up with those numbers : $ 93 trillion , $ 600,000 per household . What do you think ? SEN. JOHN BARRASSO : Well , this Green New Deal is a big green bomb that will blow a hole in our strong economy . It will destroy the energy independence we now have from foreign countries . It will destroy what we \u2019 ve been doing to actually lower emissions . The cost to families -- electricity alone would go up by about $ 3,600 per family , per year . This is something , Sandra , that we can not as a nation afford . The economy ca n't afford it . Our nation can \u2019 t survive it .\nSome Fox News personalities and Republican politicians , including President Donald Trump , have cited an even larger unsubstantiated figure for Green New Deal costs : $ 100 trillion . As Dave Anderson recently reported for the Energy and Policy Institute , that number originated from a flippant Twitter thread by a Manhattan Institute senior fellow . The Manhattan Institute has been funded by ExxonMobil , and the chair of its board is also the CEO of a hedge fund that is the top shareholder in Peabody Energy , a major coal company . The $ 100 trillion figure was mentioned by Fox host Charles Payne during an interview with EPA chief Andrew Wheeler on March 4 on Your World with Neil Cavuto , and it was also cited on other Fox programs and right-wing sites like Townhall .\nThe spread of the $ 93 trillion figure is a textbook example of how the right-wing media sphere disseminates misinformation to stymie climate action ( and the spread of the $ 100 trillion figure too , for that matter ) .

AAF rushed out a quickie estimate of its potential costs that even its lead author wo n't robustly defend .
