    "content": "The Supreme Court is currently debating the fate of one of the Obama administration 's most sweeping environmental policies \u2014 a big crackdown on mercury pollution from coal plants . And , by many accounts , the Court could potentially strike the rule down . This will be a close call .\nThe issue at hand is arcane but important : it 's all about whether the Environmental Protection Agency properly considered costs in crafting its 2012 mercury regulations , which is forcing coal-fired power plants to spend $ 9.6 billion per year cleaning up toxic mercury emissions . Combined with other economic and regulatory pressures , that rule has already hastened the retirement of many coal plants .\nThe Clean Air Act is fairly ambiguous on the legal point here , which is why , on March 25 , 2015 , the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case , Michigan v. EPA . Here 's a very basic guide to the fight , which could have big implications for Obama 's environmental legacy .\nBack in 2012 , the EPA finalized a new regulation under the Clean Air Act to limit mercury emissions and other toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants . ( This was in response to earlier court decisions that had ordered the agency to redo the way it regulates mercury . )\nThe rule was potentially a huge deal from a public health perspective , expected to save tens of thousands of lives every year . But a closer look at the numbers explains why the rule was so controversial .\nWhen it put out the rule , the EPA tallied up the costs and benefits . On the one hand , it estimated that power plants would have to pay about $ 9.6 billion per year to install scrubbers and other technologies to reduce mercury and other toxics . That would make this one of the costliest regulations of the Obama era . Many older coal plants , already facing competition from cheaper natural gas , would likely just retire .\nThe vast majority of benefits do n't come from reducing mercury \u2014 but from cutting other pollutants\nAnd what about the benefits ? That 's where things get tricky . There 's plenty of evidence that mercury , a neurotoxin , inflicts plenty of harm on the public . One 2005 study in Environmental Health Perspectives found that 637,000 babies were born each year with significant amounts of mercury in their bloodstream . About two-thirds of those kids suffered IQ loss as a result .\nAnd yet , when the EPA analyzed the rule , it estimated the benefits of reducing mercury from power plants were only $ 4 million to $ 9 million . There 's a decent case that the EPA understated those benefits , in part because economists are n't yet able to quantify all the damages from mercury . The EPA , for instance , only looked at potential `` lost wages '' \u2014 which is hardly the only reason we 'd want to limit neurological harm to children . But regardless , what the EPA 's published numbers said is that the benefits of curbing mercury were way lower than the costs .\nAt that point , EPA took another step . The agency pointed out that if coal-fired power plants installed scrubbers to clean up mercury , that would also reduce other pollutants , particularly fine particulates like soot . And these pollutants are widely known to damage lungs and kill people . The EPA estimated that the benefits from doing so were worth some $ 26 billion to $ 89 billion per year . Looked at in this light , the benefits of the rule far exceeded the cost .\nWhen the rule came out , environmentalists hailed it as a sweeping public health measure and a worthy investment . Industry groups complained that the costs of reducing mercury appeared to vastly outweigh the benefits of cleaning up mercury . And , in a sense , both sides were right .\nIn theory , the EPA is supposed to consider costs and benefits when setting a regulation . The key question is how this is supposed to happen . And the Clean Act turns out to be a little vague on this point .\nAfter all , the EPA did two distinct things here . First it had to determine whether regulating mercury was `` appropriate and necessary '' in the first place . The agency decided that , yes , mercury is harmful and it should be regulated .\nThen the EPA actually crafted the regulations . At that stage , it took all of the relevant costs and benefits into account .\nThe key question is exactly how the EPA should have taken costs into account\nIndustry groups and states like Michigan sued the EPA , arguing that the agency should have taken costs into account during that first stage \u2014 when determining whether mercury was worth regulating . If the agency had done so , they argue , it would have realized that its initial determination was not `` appropriate '' since the costs vastly outweigh the tiny benefits .\nThe EPA , for its part , is arguing the Clean Air Act does not require costs to be taken into account in that initial stage . Instead , the agency considers costs in the later stage , when it 's actually setting regulations . And , the EPA says , that 's what it did \u2014 it crafted rules with at least $ 27 billion in annual benefits and $ 9.6 billion in costs .\nIt 's unclear who will win this fight \u2014 the law is vague\nThe reason this is a big legal brawl is that the Clean Air Act is ambiguous on this question . `` It 's a question of how to take costs into account under statutes that are silent on the issue , '' Richard Revesz , a law professor at New York University , told me in Novemeber .\nLast year , two out of three judges on a panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the EPA did the right thing here .\nThe Clean Air Act is frustratingly vague on this point\n`` For EPA to focus its \u2018 appropriate and necessary \u2019 determination on factors relating to public health hazards , and not industry \u2019 s objections that emission controls are costly , properly puts the horse before the cart , '' wrote Judge Judith W. Rogers in the majority opinion .\nBut Brett Kavanaugh , a conservative judge on the court , dissented , saying that EPA should have considered costs in that first stage as a matter of `` common sense . '' `` The problem here is that EPA did not even consider the costs . And the costs are huge , about $ 9.6 billion a year \u2014 that \u2019 s billion with a \u2018 b \u2019 \u2014 by EPA 's own calculation . ''\nThe Supreme Court then took up the case .
