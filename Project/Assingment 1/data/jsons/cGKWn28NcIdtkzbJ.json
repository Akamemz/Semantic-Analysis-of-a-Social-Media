He denied to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday that his tendency was to interrupt female reporters .\n`` I think I 've been universally short tempered and testy with both male and female reporters . I 'll own up to that , '' he said .\nPaul said it can be difficult when being interviewed and facing only a camera and not being able to see the reporter , `` particularly if it 's a hostile interviewer . ''\n`` I do think interviews should be questions and not editorializing . You feel somewhat at a loss at the other end , '' he added .\nExhibiting a bit of contrition , Paul said , `` I think I should have more patience . I think it 's pretty equal opportunity .

''\nWhen Guthrie persisted and asked the Republican if Iran is `` still not a threat , '' Paul said the NBC host had `` editorialized . ''\n`` Listen , you 've editorialized , '' Paul said . `` Let me answer a question . You ask a question , and you say , 'Have your views changed ? ' instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed . ''\nPaul contended that his views on foreign aid have been consistent . He said circumstances have changed since 2007 when he suggested that Iran does not pose a threat to the United States .\n`` Yeah , 2007 was a long time ago , and events do change over long periods of time . So , we 're talking about eight years ago .
