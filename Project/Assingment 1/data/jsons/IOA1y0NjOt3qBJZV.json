Their holding Obama at arm 's length deprives voters of a clear choice at the ballot box .\nKentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is a great candidate for the U.S. Senate and is running a solid campaign . But she made a mistake when she refused to answer the question from the Louisville Courier-Journal about which presidential candidate she voted for in 2012 .\nGrimes should have said she voted for President Obama and then gone on to explain her policy differences with him . By ducking the question , all she did was make news out of her refusal to give a routine answer to a routine question . If Grimes does n't care for Obama or what he stands for or has accomplished , just say so .\nLike most Democrats running this fall , Grimes can not win the election without the support of the Democratic base , and the Democratic base expects her to vote for a Democratic president against his Republican opponent .\nHaving forthrightly identified herself as a Democrat , Grimes can go on to explain what kind of Democrat she is -- a Clinton Democrat , a moderate Democrat , a Kentucky Democrat , a Blue Dog Democrat , or simply a woman who has shown voters that she is wise and if elected , will work hard to put their interest first -- not simply try to score partisan points .\nGrimes is more than a match for incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell . She is every bit as tough as him , without his baggage of government shutdowns , his focus on making Obama a one-term president ( and failing at it ) , and his love of extreme partisan politics .\nShe hit hard in the only debate of the race . `` Sen. McConnell 's 30-year record\u2014it 's gridlock , it 's obstruction , it 's extreme partisanship that 's cost this nation a 16-day government shutdown . We ca n't afford to go in that direction .
