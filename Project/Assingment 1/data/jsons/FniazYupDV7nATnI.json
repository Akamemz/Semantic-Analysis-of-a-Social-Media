Republicans are getting better but need to work harder to match Democrats \u2019 modern online voter ID tools and expertise .\nSecond , Republicans were unable to convince voters that they had a clear set of alternative policies that would produce significantly better economic results for the country than Obama \u2019 s record , which featured little economic growth or job creation and huge budget deficits . This was thought to be the GOP \u2019 s strongest argument , but it didn \u2019 t move the electorate nearly enough for Romney to win .\nThe task was complicated by the willingness of many voters to blame former President George W.

Also , the ( very ) slowly improving economic numbers convinced a plurality of voters that the economy was actually getting better rather than worse .\nObama argued that he was doing the best anyone could under the circumstances . Much of the mainstream media bought his argument completely . When Romney announced his 12 million job creation goal , very achievable by historic standards , most in the media scoffed and immediately pronounced it unattainable .\nWe are learning to settle for less because government continues to perform so poorly .
