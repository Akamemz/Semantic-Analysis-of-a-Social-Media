    "content": "Miami ( CNN ) There were few softballs Wednesday night for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .\nClinton was asked whether she lied about Benghazi , whether she might be indicted over her emails and why she 's seen as so untrustworthy . Sanders was pressed on comments he made in the mid-1980s about Fidel Castro and pushed to defend his 2007 vote against an immigration reform bill .\nOne day after Sanders ' stunning win in Michigan , both candidates were on their game in their only debate before next Tuesday 's critical votes in Florida , Ohio , Illinois and North Carolina .\nHere are five takeaways from Wednesday night 's debate , hosted by Univision and The Washington Post :\nClinton and Sanders both broke with the Obama White House and pledged to halt the deportations of undocumented immigrants who do n't have criminal records .\n`` I do not want to see them deported . I want to see them on a path to citizenship . That is exactly what I will do , '' Clinton said .\nJUST WATCHED Clinton , Sanders weigh on Donald Trump 's border wall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton , Sanders weigh on Donald Trump 's border wall 01:12\nAnd both candidates dismissed Donald Trump 's proposal to build a `` big , beautiful wall '' along the U.S.-Mexico border as bluster .\n`` As I understand him , he 's talking about a very tall wall -- a beautiful tall wall , better than the Great Wall of China , '' Clinton said . `` It 's just fantasy . ''\nIt exposed a huge divide between the two parties : The Republican front-runner wants mass deportations . The Democratic contenders want no deportations at all . There 's no middle ground anymore .\nThe evaporation of any sort of common ground on the issue of immigration helps explain the political plight of Republican candidates who have supported comprehensive reform measures , like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the departed South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush .\nIt also underscores why 2016 's election is so much about motivating each party 's base , rather than appealing to voters in the middle . The center did n't hold .\nIt was just days ago that Clinton , riding a wave of Super Tuesday victories , was dropping her attacks on Sanders , looking for ways to appeal to his supporters and casting her eyes on Republicans -- particularly Donald Trump .\nIf she 'd pivoted into general election mode , she went right back to the primary on Wednesday night .\nOn the heels of her loss in Michigan , Clinton was set on attacking Sanders on every question -- and most of the time , Sanders gave her the clash she wanted .\nClinton cast Sanders as an enemy of liberal icon Ted Kennedy , noting that he 'd voted `` against Ted Kennedy 's immigration reform which he 'd been working on for years before you ever arrived . ''\nShe hit him for opposing the auto bailout , even though fact-checkers had already pointed out that attack amounted to cherry-picking one item out of a much larger bank bailout bill -- using that issue to frame Sanders as someone so rigid in his ideology that he ca n't get things done .\n`` I 'll tell you , it was a hard vote . A lot of the votes you make are hard votes , '' Clinton said . `` But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill . ''\nIt was all a reminder that the Democratic presidential contest might not be anywhere near its end . Next Tuesday -- when Florida , North Carolina , Ohio , Illinois and Missouri vote -- was the day Clinton hoped to knock Sanders out . Now , Sanders poses a serious threat across the Midwest .\nSure , both candidates took their shots at Trump . Clinton called him `` un-American '' and Sanders called him someone who `` insults Mexicans , who insults Muslims , who insults women , who insults African-Americans . ''\nClinton made an unusually frank admission when she was pressed on why so many Americans find her untrustworthy .\n`` I am not a natural politician , in case you have n't noticed , like my husband and President Obama . So I have a view that I have to do the best I can , '' Clinton said , adding that she hopes `` people will see I am fighting for them . ''\nIt was an effective moment -- an introspective acknowledgment from a politician who has struggled to project authenticity .\nAnd it came right on the heels of a touching moment between Clinton and a woman who had discussed her hardships after her undocumented husband was deported .\n`` Please know how brave I think you are , coming here with your children to tell your story . This is an incredible act of courage that I 'm not sure many people really understand . And I want you to know that , '' Clinton said .\nIt was n't Bill Clinton personalizing the national debt in a 1992 debate by talking about the people he knows who have lost jobs .
