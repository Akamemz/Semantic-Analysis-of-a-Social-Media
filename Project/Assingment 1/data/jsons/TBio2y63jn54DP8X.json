    "content": "If Facebook is concerned about a growing chorus of accusations that the social media giant suppresses some voices and elevates others in accord with the company 's prevailing political biases , that 's not obvious in the firm 's latest purge of political pages and accounts .\nOn Thursday , October 11 , Nathaniel Gleicher , Facebook 's Head of Cybersecurity Policy and Oscar Rodriguez , Product Manager , announced the company was shutting down 559 pages and 251 accounts `` created to stir up political debate . '' Allegedly , the targets were guilty of `` coordinated inauthentic behavior '' intended `` to mislead others about who they are , and what they are doing . '' The targeted pages and accounts included many pages , and their administrators , who have gained popularity by voicing ideas outside the mainstream\u2014including skepticism of violent and intrusive police tactics and support for libertarian ideas .\n`` We lost a 190K page that we started in 2010 , '' Matt Bergman , an administrator of Punk Rock Libertarians , told me with regard to the reach of the page Facebook shut down without warning . `` I also [ ran ] the Daily Liberator page which had 95K people on there . Now we 're starting over with a page that has less than 400 people on it . ''\nOther purged pages included Cop Block , which is critical of law-enforcement practices , conservative Right Wing News , and progressive Reverb Press . Photography Is Not a Crime , which advocates for the right to record government officials in public places , was `` severely restricted , '' according to former Reasoner Radley Balko .\nFacebook accused the hundreds of pages it purged of distributing `` spam , '' though the social media company used a curious definition of the word . Instead of flooding unwilling recipients with unsolicited ads , the company said , the targeted organizations posted `` clickbait posts on these Pages to drive people to websites that are entirely separate from Facebook and seem legitimate , but are actually ad farms . ''\nTo the millions of supporters these pages draw , these organizations and the sites they publish almost certainly did `` seem legitimate '' \u2014and still do . Perhaps Facebook does n't like seeing readers depart its service for off-site publications that compete for eyeballs on content and ads .\nIn addition to the political pages themselves , page administrators ' personal Facebook accounts were targeted , if only briefly .\n`` I was deleted for about 4 hours , '' Bergman messaged me . `` Facebook told us all that we were deleted and asked us to upload photos of ourselves [ to be restored ] even tho I 've been uploading photos of myself since 2008 . ''\nLike many of the other pages , Punk Rock Libertarians appealed being purged , but has yet to hear back .\nFacebook has long faced charges of political bias\u2014with evidence to support the accusations . In 2016 , former employees of the social media giant told Gizmodo that co-workers regularly prevented stories of interest to conservatives and libertarians from appearing in the `` trending '' news section while boosting other stories . Such selective treatment was reportedly a result not of official policy , but of workers marinating in a shared mindset that affected their judgment .\nConcern over that shared mindset inspired senior Facebook engineer Brian Amerige to complain in an August 2018 message to co-workers that `` We are a political monoculture that 's intolerant of different views . '' He added , `` We claim to welcome all perspectives , but are quick to attack \u2014 often in mobs \u2014 anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology . ''\nInterestingly , Amerige quit shortly before the purge , informing co-workers in a memo , `` I care too deeply about our role in supporting free expression and intellectual diversity to even whole-heartedly attempt the product stuff anymore , and that 's how I know it 's time to go . ''\nBut the timing appears to have been coincidental , and perhaps just more evidence of the controlling direction in which the company is moving .\n`` I do n't have much context on this one , '' Amerige told me about the purge , `` and it was n't specifically related to my departure , no . ''\nBut if earlier concerns were about left-wing bias , the latest purge seems to represent more of a bias in favor of establishment voices . The latest purged pages do n't share an ideology , but they are generally non-mainstream voices critical of government policies and institutions , and of traditional media .\nFacebook is n't answering my questions about the company 's motivations or decision-making . But it looks like the social media giant , under fire for enabling a few Russian government trolls and a lot of free-wheeling ( if not always temperate ) debate in a politically volatile time , has thrown in with the powers-that-be . The establishment may be battered , but it 's not out , and muzzling anti-establishment voices could well look like a safe bet .\n`` We 've accepted the inevitability of government regulation , '' Amerige lamented in his resignation letter . `` Our policy strategy is pragmatism\u2014not clear , implementable long-term principles\u2014and our PR strategy is appeasement\u2014not morally earned pride and self-defense .
