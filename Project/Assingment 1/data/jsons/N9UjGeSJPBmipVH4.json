    "content": "Well , the day has arrived . The long-awaited report from Michael Horowitz , the Department of Justice \u2019 s inspector general , on the alleged FISA abuses that occurred under the Obama administration will be released . We already have some tidbits that this report doesn \u2019 t corroborate the allegation that the Obama White House spied on the Trump campaign , but it will conclude that there were deviations from department policy concerning the process in obtaining these warrants . Okay , let \u2019 s play on that for a minute . That \u2019 s still not good . The liberal media will chalk this up as a win for them because President Trump \u2019 s accusation won \u2019 t be legitimized or something . There \u2019 s still an ongoing pattern of FBI officials going off the reservation in order to get what they want . We know they didn \u2019 t want Trump to be president . We know disgraced former FBI Director James Comey took memos he had about the meeting she had with the president and gave them to a friend who leaked them to The New York Times . This was done on purpose ; it was meant to ensure a special counsel investigation . The liberal media was out in full force last week trying to spin the report as a dud against the anti-Trump wing of America .\nThere seems to be a \u2018 see no bias \u2019 issue at the DOJ . The FBI is the top law enforcement force in the country , but it \u2019 s also our largest domestic intelligence agency . We knew they had far-reaching surveillance powers , just look up Hoover and COINTELPRO . Agents going rogue isn \u2019 t new . And now we have some allegation that in the process of getting a FISA spy warrant for Carter Page , a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign and supposed Russian collusion boogeyman , they altered the warrant . A secret court almost always grants FISA warrants . That \u2019 s another problem . It \u2019 s also a problem that the FBI didn \u2019 t notice that the Trump dossier , the basis for this mess , was a biased and unverified piece of political opposition research that was funded by the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign . The Clintons retained the services of Fusion GPS , a research firm , who then hired ex-MI6 spook Christopher Steele to get dirt on Trump . The errors in the dossier prove the FBI did next to nothing to verify it . Why ? Congress asked another disgraced FBI official , Andrew McCabe , about that and he didn \u2019 t want to answer the question . I wonder why . The State Department knew that the dossier was trash because Steele told them , and members of British intelligence were also skeptical of the details . Then , why was this piece of political propaganda considered a credible piece of evidence in obtaining these warrants ? It sounds like a sitting Democratic president \u2019 s DOJ was spying on the presidential operation of a candidate from a rival party . That sounds like an overreach , huh ?\nOh , and as for the spying , The Times assured us that it didn \u2019 t happen\u2026because they said so . My eyes can not roll hard enough with this attempt to suggest there was no spying . The FBI wasn \u2019 t spying on the Trump campaign , they just sent their operatives to try and get information from its members without them knowing their true background and relaying said information if any to their superiors . But that \u2019 s not spying . Bloomberg \u2019 s Eli Lake tweeted , \u201c The FBI never tried to place informants inside the Trump campaign . They only ran informants to solicit information from people who worked for the campaign . Is it just me , or does this seem like a distinction without a difference ? \u201d Larry O \u2019 Connor , a Washington Times editor and radio host for WMAL \u2019 s afternoon drive , also mocked this spin when the publication tried to pass that off months ago . This was when the story about some person named Azra Turk was sent by the FBI to oversee an operation that included Stefan Halper , the other FBI informant who was trying to get information from George Papadopoulos , Sam Clovis , and Carter Page . It was the London rendezvous during the 2016 election cycle . Alas , we have \u201c Operation Crossfire. \u201d Papadopoulos , one of the Trump officials targeted , said he had no issue with The Times ' story at the time , though he thought the woman named Turk was CIA , not FBI . Even then the headline for that story was \u201c FBI Used Informant to Investigate Russia Ties to Campaign , Not Spy. \u201d Yeah , that \u2019 s like someone declaring that they \u2019 re not vegan , they just don \u2019 t eat anything from animals .\nIt \u2019 s simply not believable that there was no bias at the DOJ/FBI during the 2016 cycle . Folks , have we forgotten the other Trump dossier-DOJ link here with Bruce Ohr ? The former top DOJ official , whose wife worked at Fusion , had contact with Christopher Steele and tried to keep that hidden , a move that led to his demotion .\nEven the \u2018 there was no spying \u2019 counterpunch is weak . James Clapper , Obama \u2019 s former spy czar , even said what the FBI did here fit the dictionary definition of spying . And with the media having tripped over so many rakes in being wrong with their coverage of Trump due to their bias\u2014none of this is believable . We \u2019 ll have the details here later .",
