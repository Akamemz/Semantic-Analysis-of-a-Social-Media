    "content": "It was 6 am , just a few weeks after Donald Trump had moved into the White House \u2014 and there was a light on in the East Wing . It was possible that Trump , notoriously an early riser , was in the residence watching Fox & Friends . It was his favorite morning show , one that he praised publicly , often tweeting about a segment right after it aired .\nBut the hosts of the show wanted to know for sure .\nSo they told the president : If you 're watching , flicker the lights to let us know .\nThe hosts wondered if maybe Trump needed time to run down the hallway from his bedroom , where he was watching the show . Surely that 's why the president of the United States was n't playing with the light switch for them .\nBut lo and behold , about eight minutes later , co-host Steve Doocy said , `` Let 's see if the lights are flickering at the White House . '' On cue , the lights in the East Wing turned on and off .\nSoon thereafter , Doocy admitted it was a prank : `` It 's a video effect . We did n't actually do that . '' What might 've been one of the more astounding moments in cable news was actually fake . Still , this gag was prescient , giving us accurate insight into how Fox & Friends would evolve in a Trump presidency .\nSince Trump was elected , Fox & Friends has taken a special place in the media landscape . It \u2019 s clear that the program is in something of a feedback loop with the president . But contrary to what CNN president Jeff Zucker says , this is n't state-run television `` extolling the line out of the White House . '' Scholars tend to say state-run media usually aims to keep the rank and file in line , while demobilizing the populace and deflating political opposition . Most of it is very boring . Watch some live Chinese state-run media and you 'll immediately understand .\nWe analyzed 17 months of Fox & Friends transcripts , which captures nearly a year before Trump was elected president and about six months after . ( More on the methodology at the bottom of this piece . )\nWhat we found is that Fox & Friends has a symbiotic relationship with Trump that is far weirder and more interesting than state media . Instead of talking for Trump , they are talking to him .\nThe regular hosts \u2014 Steve Doocy , Brian Kilmeade , and Ainsley Earhardt \u2014 and their rotating cast of guests increasingly view their role as giving advice to the president . They prognosticate on what the president , his staff , or his party should do . And it \u2019 s all couched in language that makes it seem they are on his side \u2014 that the damning news reports from mainstream media were unfair obstacles to his presidency .\nThat is in contrast to what Fox & Friends was before Trump . In 2013 , media scholar Jeffrey P. Jones argued that Fox & Friends creates an ideologically homogenous community and reinforces it by creating a high school-like atmosphere . `` The show is designed to thrust the viewer into a common-sense groupthink , complete with all the rumours , smears , innuendo , fear-mongering , thinly veiled ad hominem attacks , and lack of rational discourse they can muster \u2014 you know , just like high school , '' he writes .\nBut in the 2016 election , the man who loves their show and listens to their political and cultural ruminations became the leader of the free world .\nFox & Friends went from being the bully on the periphery to the prom king \u2019 s posse .\nBefore Trump became the Republican nominee for president , Fox News had a somewhat adversarial relationship with Trump . He was an outsider , a former Democrat , a reality TV star \u2014 and not always good at getting in line with the Republican Party . In fact , one of his signature moments in the primary was taking down Jeb Bush , the establishment candidate .\nBut Fox & Friends was always friendlier to Trump , a frequent caller to the show , and its coverage was a preview of how the rest of the network would evolve .\nThe show \u2019 s hosts were always good at making Trump feel like they were on his side , but once he won the presidency , Fox & Friends ramped up this rhetoric , whether consciously or not .\nThey started using \u201c we \u201d statements with a lot more frequency , hinting that his goals and his identity were somehow tied to theirs .\nAnd they quickly started referring to him as merely \u201c the president \u201d \u2014 something they didn \u2019 t always afford to President Obama .\nConnotation is a lot harder to pin down on television , much less in transcripts , but a review of several instances show that saying \u201c the president \u201d often seemed to drive home the idea that Trump won the election , fair and square .\nFox & Friends may have evolved this way because the Republican Party took over both chambers in Congress and the White House . But it also serves to send a constant signal to the president that they are on his side , and to frame news stories for their viewers in that context .\nThe symbiotic relationship Fox & Friends has with the president can get complicated , particularly as tensions mount around the Russia scandal and the firing of FBI Director James Comey .\nThat \u2019 s because the show wants to paint Trump in a favorable light , but it also wants to be a news source to inform its viewers .\nThe way Fox & Friends gets around this tension is clever \u2014 and weird .\nIn May , after President Trump fired Comey , the hosts talked about what Trump should do about the Republicans who wanted to hire a special prosecutor to investigate him .\nKILMEADE : I think it would have been good for the president to work the phones , because he is the best at that : `` Listen , this is my school of thought \u2014 this is what I 'm looking to do . We all know the Russia investigation is going nowhere . How do I get this done with the least amount of ancillary damage ? '' EARHARDT : Here is the bottom line : He is the boss . And he gets to decide who works for him . Someone who works for him who is not supportive of him , he gets rid of them . He has the ability to do that .\nThe hosts are basically telling Trump what they would do in this situation . They are covering the news by advising him .\nIt 's something the show 's hosts and guests have done with far more frequency since Trump has been in office . An analysis of the show 's transcripts reveal that about 8 to 9 percent of sentences before Trump 's election were imperative sentences , which instruct or advise . In the first few months of his presidency , that number increased more than 50 percent .\nThe analysis also shows that the people on the show increasingly assured their guests about the future . There 's been a massive uptick in the number of times people say that people are `` going to do '' something , whether that 's Trump or Republicans or whoever else they may be talking about . It 's often part of them gaming out scenarios , or assuming they know the president well enough that they can predict he 'll act a certain way .\nAfter Comey was fired , the hosts predicted that some Congress members would call for a special prosecutor \u2014 but would n't get one because there 's not enough evidence .\nIt seems as though the show 's primary goal is no longer to talk to an audience \u2014 but rather to talk to the president . Before Trump , Fox & Friends would often attribute arguments to `` some people '' as a way to create straw men or make an anecdotal argument .\nBut as the show 's coverage shifts to an advisory session for Trump , these kinds of arguments have decreased :\nOne consequence of covering these stories with suggestions to Trump is that often it obscures what the real story is . In Fox & Friends \u2019 framing , the Russia investigation is an obstacle to overcome , rather than an undertaking that could possibly reveal something about Trump 's relationship with Russia .

He has this list of stuff , he wants to get it done , and now it \u2019 s Robert Mueller there .

I think the next thing the president should do , besides pushing tax reform , is start doing some infrastructure . ...
