But as described by Sen. Ron Wyden ( D ) of Oregon , Mr. Obama \u2019 s point person on trade in the Senate , \u201c the president was all-in on this issue . \u201d\nNo question , the president \u2019 s trade agenda took tremendous bipartisan effort to shape and pass . Senator Wyden took care to praise Republican leaders who he said were always \u201c straight \u201d with him . They rescued the trade package from a surprise derailment by House Democrats earlier this month . The president , too , applauded Republicans and Democrats for `` coming together '' on trade .\nBut it was Democrats who held the key to this presidential priority . Most Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress may have agreed with Obama on trade , but not enough of them did . To win this signature item , Obama was going to have to win and hold some Democrats , and that was going to take persistent outreach and a convincing argument .\nIn the end , \u201c gutsy \u201d pro-trade Democrats in both houses stuck together despite pressure to abandon a deal , Wyden said . And a \u201c very determined president \u201d used the bully pulpit to explain how his approach differs from trade policy of the 1990s , which many Democrats blame for lost jobs and lower wages .\nHis articulation of his policy \u201c was a very significant help \u201d as was his outreach to Congress , Wyden told reporters Wednesday .\nThe result was the passage of two trade bills by the Senate Wednesday . The first , called fast track , means that Congress can not amend any trade bill the president negotiates \u2013 it can only vote up or down . The second provides assistance for workers displaced by global trade . Both bills have now passed both houses , and together , they are one of Obama \u2019 s major second-term priorities . He intends to use the authority to negotiate a historic trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim nations .\nTo get to this point , the president put in hours on the phone with Wyden , at times talking two or three times a day , working out the next day \u2019 s strategy in 11 p.m. phone calls . And he stayed in touch with the GOP leadership .\nBut he also reached out to other lawmakers . Sen. Chris Coons ( D ) of Delaware says the president \u2019 s outreach persuaded him to vote \u201c yes . \u201d\nIn the five years since he \u2019 s been a senator , Senator Coons says he \u2019 s never had as much engagement with the White House on any issue as on trade .
