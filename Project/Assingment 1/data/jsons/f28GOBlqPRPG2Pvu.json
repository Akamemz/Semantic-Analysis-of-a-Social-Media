    "content": "Democrats , Planned Parenthood and others on the left are trying to generate pseudo-hysteria by falsely demonizing Judge Brett Kavanaugh as being anti-woman in the days leading up to the Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday on his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court .\nWhile trying to portray themselves as champions of womankind , those fighting the nomination of Kavanaugh are instead insulting the intelligence of women and men with their absurd attacks .\nThe Kavanaugh opponents are trying to stir up uncontrolled and extreme emotions relating to the Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide \u2013 in their campaign to keep Kavanaugh off the nation \u2019 s highest court .\nNo one can credibly claim that Kavanaugh is not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court . He \u2019 s been a judge on the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia since 2006 . He has a sterling record since graduating from Yale Law School in 1990 , including serving as a Supreme Court clerk , a lawyer in the White House Counsel \u2019 s Office , and White House staff secretary for President George W. Bush .\nJudge Kavanaugh has shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that has an intentional , extraordinary record of helping women .\nSo instead of examining his qualifications or judicial record , those opposed to Kavanaugh are working overtime to smear his reputation with false charges .\nAnd in addition to trying to derail the judge \u2019 s nomination , those opposing him are engaged in a cynical propaganda campaign of political fundraising . They are urging donors to give money to Democrats to defeat Republicans in the November midterm elections in order to block the confirmation of future judicial nominees advanced by President Trump .\nThe campaign to keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court has taken some strange and frankly disgusting turns . For example , a lame Planned Parenthood video , made with the help of the group \u2019 s friends at \u201c Funny or Die , \u201d tries to inject humor into the deadly serious topic of abortion . Excuse me for not laughing .\nIt used to be that abortion was discussed in a sober manner , even by those on the left . Remember when they claimed they actually wanted abortion to be \u201c safe , legal , and rare ? \u201d Sadly , those days are long gone .\nNow the pro-abortion forces are trivializing the pain and struggle of women confronted with the terrible choice of whether to have an abortion or instead grant their unborn child the right to live a full life .\nIn the Planned Parenthood video , which is designed to mobilize opposition to Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination , an actor who is playing the part of a dumb and clueless conservative addresses women and says : \u201c Basically , I \u2019 m here to explain to you , as a man , that you \u2019 re wrong about Brett Kavanaugh . \u201d\nHa ! See what they did there ? Because only men support Kavanaugh , you see . So clever . The joke continues for what seems like an eternity , and the faux-conservative actor points out that Kavanaugh will be good for women because he has a \u201c female wife , female mother , and female mother-in-law . \u201d\nThe actor even says \u201c ladies , let me talk to you like a lady \u201d and switches to a falsetto voice . Thankfully , he doesn \u2019 t put on a wig and a dress for added comedic effect .\nThey make millions with these jokes . They kill at the Oscars .\nBut millions of women recognize this nonsense as phony , not funny . They reject the assumption that those of us who support the right to life for the unborn are anti-woman , and that pro-life women are traitors to the cause of women \u2019 s rights .\nInstead of engaging conservative women in a respectful way and debating the record of Judge Kavanaugh , opponents of his nomination prefer to mock the pain of millions of women as one big joke . For example , NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon has partnered with an ice cream shop to sell abortion-themed ice cream . The oh-so clever flavor is called \u201c Rocky Roe v. Wade . \u201d\nWhy ? Because the pro-abortion groups want women to celebrate abortions and promote them to girls .\nConcerned Women for America ( CWA ) , the organization I lead , has thousands of members around the country who support Judge Kavanaugh because he is a man of integrity who will uphold the Constitution as written , instead of bending it and giving it new meaning to promote his personal preferences .\nI have written about Kavanaugh \u2019 s substantive record and why we can trust him . Our \u201c Women for Kavanaugh \u201d bus tour visited seven key states ( Iowa , Indiana , West Virginia , Missouri , North Dakota , Alabama , and Florida ) to win the support of senators for Kavanaugh .
