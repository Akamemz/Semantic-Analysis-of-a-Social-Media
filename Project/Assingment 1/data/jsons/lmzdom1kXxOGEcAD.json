Hillary floated her as an \u2018 angel \u2019 without checking her past , which is terrible ! \u201d read one tweet sent a little after 5 a.m. , followed by , \u201c Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT ! Hillary was set up by a con . \u201d\nHe wrapped up his rant with : \u201c Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting ( check out sex tape and past ) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate ? \u201d\nIt was his most vicious lashing out since Hillary Clinton revived his long-running feud with Machado on Monday night \u2019 s debate stage . As Trump tried to again attack Clinton \u2019 s \u201c stamina , \u201d the Democratic nominee sprung a trap , saying one of the worst things Trump has said about a woman was his public shaming of Machado after she gained a few pounds during her reign .\n\u201c He loves beauty contests , supporting them and hanging around them . And he called this woman \u2018 Miss Piggy. \u2019 Then he called her \u2018 Miss Housekeeping , \u2019 because she was Latina , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c Donald , she has a name . Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen , and you can bet she 's going to vote this November . \u201d\nTrump has since been unable to restrain himself , attacking Machado as Clinton \u2019 s camp has pushed her forcefully into the public eye , playing right into the Democratic nominee \u2019 s argument that Trump lacks the temperament and impulse control to be commander in chief .\nAnd Clinton \u2019 s gambit is paying off . While most pundits swiftly declared Clinton the winner of Monday night \u2019 s showdown for her poised and lucid showing , a burst of polls out Thursday night and Friday morning provided the first tangible evidence that voters agreed .\nA Florida poll showed Clinton with a 4-point lead over Trump ( a 2-point gain since the previous survey ) , and polls out of New Hampshire and Michigan gave the former secretary of state 7-point leads in both of those states .\nIf other surveys follow suit , it will provide Clinton with some breathing space after a tense patch in which polls showed that the presidential race had tightened into a dead heat going into Monday \u2019 s faceoff .\nLater Friday , Trump defended himself against political pundits who spent much of the day attacking him for the very-early morning Twitter spree , writing , \u201c For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning , at least you know I will be there , awake , to answer the call ! \u201d\nIn an Instagram post responding to Trump 's attacks against her , Machado wrote in Spanish that the GOP nominee was `` reviving defamations and false accusations about my life. \u201d She said that she `` will keep standing , sharing my story , and my absolute support of Mrs. Clinton on behalf of all women , my sisters , aunts , grandmothers , cousins , friends and the female community . ''\n`` This , of course , is not the first time I have faced a situation like this , '' she added . `` Through their campaign of hate , the Republican candidate tries to discredit and demoralize a woman , which is definitely one of his most terrifying features . With this , he is seeking to distract attention from his real problems and of his real incapacity to even pretend to be the leader of this great country . ''\nClinton 's campaign jumped on Trump 's Machado tweets later Friday morning , eager for yet another chance to highlight his tendency to fling derogatory remarks at women . `` What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories ? '' Clinton posted to her Twitter account , the second in a nine-tweet flurry . `` Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell \u2014 an accomplished actor . He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight \u2014 when she was pregnant . Pathetic , '' she wrote minutes later , punctuating her online attack by telling her followers that `` while Donald continues day 5 of his Machado meltdown , we 'll be in Florida talking about national service . You 'll want to watch . ''\nShe drove home a similar message at an afternoon rally in Coral Springs , Florida , suggesting Trump 's latest tirade \u201c proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander in chief. \u201d \u201c I mean , really , who gets up at 3 o \u2019 clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe ? I mean , he hurled as many insults as he could . Really , why does he do things like that ? \u201d Clinton asked .\n\u201c Because he \u2019 s an idiot , \u201d one supporter shouted , though Clinton herself actually responded by calling \u201c his latest Twitter meltdown ... unhinged , even for him . \u201d\nThe episode took another bizarre turn late Friday , when BuzzFeed reported that Trump himself once made a cameo \u2014 fully clothed \u2014 in a softcore porn video .\n`` There 's been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump , '' Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told her traveling press .\nClinton 's campaign has eagerly trotted Machado out as a surrogate , hosting a conference call with the former beauty pageant winner earlier this week . On Friday , the campaign provided a readout of Clinton 's call to Machado , where she thanked the former Miss Universe for her support and courage . Machado replied that she has been a longtime supporter of Clinton 's and looks forward to her becoming president .\n\u201c The Clinton campaign could not have asked for more , \u201d David Axelrod , President Barack Obama \u2019 s chief campaign strategist , said on CNN .\nAxelrod said it is \u201c unfathomable \u201d that Trump made such a self-destructive move on the Friday after the debate , adding that it was a \u201c shrewd thing \u201d for Clinton to poke Trump on his past comments about Machado .\n\u201c They wanted to make this an issue and he is cooperating in that project , \u201d he said . \u201c And I 'm telling you , none of his advisers are telling him to do this . This is the way Donald Trump is , he 's very reactive , the Clinton folks figured that out , they were pushing his buttons all throughout that debate and he is still reeling from that . \u201d\nSpeaking to Clinton 's traveling press pool Friday morning , the former secretary of state 's communications director , Jennifer Palmieri , said lashing out at women after a poor debate performance has become something of a pattern for Trump , who also feuded with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after the first Republican primary debate . She said Trump 's attack against the former pageant winner is `` distasteful to voters and backfires on him , '' adding that `` It is , on some level , how he 's run most of his campaign , which is to divide people . ''\n`` The resolution of the issue for him is simple . He could stop attacking her and apologize . I think that 's the point of her tweets . He insulted her in real-time as Miss Universe , he did it last night , he did it two days ago . Hillary 's going to stand up and defend her . And it is a pattern with him , '' Palmieri told reporters . `` It is not apparent to us why he simply ca n't stop attacking her . He 's had many opportunities to right the offense that she took to how she was treated 20 years ago . ''\nThe GOP nominee 's early-morning flurry of tweets is made even more problematic by the fact that much of the allegations about Machado in his tweets represent a stretching of the truth at best , if not an outright falsehood . The `` past '' to which Trump referred in his tweets is likely an allusion to a 1998 Venezuelan murder case in which Machado was investigated , but never charged , for allegedly driving a getaway car for her then-boyfriend after he shot and wounded his brother-in-law at a memorial service . The judge in that case later accused the former Miss Universe of threatening him over the phone , an allegation she denied .\nAnd while Trump , joined by conservative media moguls Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , has suggested that Machado has previously appeared in pornographic films , there is no evidence to suggest that that is the case . The former Miss Universe has posed nude in Playboy and appeared in risque reality TV shows , but The Daily Beast and other media outlets that have investigated claims that she appeared in pornographic videos have found those claims to be false .\nHis suggestion that Clinton may have helped Machado gain U.S. citizenship is also problematic . The former pageant winner told Cosmopolitan Magazine this week that she became a citizen last August specifically to vote against Trump , well after Clinton 's 2013 departure from the State Department . Even if Clinton had still been at the State Department when Machado became a citizen , the naturalization process would have been out of her control because U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , which handles the naturalization process , is part of the Department of Homeland Security . Any influence she would have had over Machado 's citizenship process would have been limited to whatever clout she maintained as a former Cabinet secretary .\nAsked Friday morning if either the campaign or Clinton herself had helped Machado become a U.S. citizen , Palmieri said they had not .\nTrump , in his tweetstorm on Friday morning , also continued chafing at media reports that his advisers were disappointed with his debate performance and plan to force him to aggressively practice before the next showdown on Oct. 9 .\nIn his Twitter spree , the Manhattan billionaire warned against believing the reports .\n\u201c Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying \u2018 sources said , \u2019 DO NOT believe it . There are no sources , they are just made up lies ! \u201d Trump tweeted a little after 3 a.m .\nHe followed up with another tweet at about 9 a.m. , saying , \u201c Remember , do n't believe \u2018 sources said \u2019 by the VERY dishonest media . If they do n't name the sources , the sources do n't exist . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s allies in recent days have been flooding the airwaves , trying to spin his shaky performance on Monday night as a stellar one . One of the main talking points has been that Trump was a \u201c gentleman \u201d for not bringing up Bill Clinton \u2019 s infidelities and hasn \u2019 t gotten the credit he deserved .\n\u201c He thought about it , and I \u2019 m sure he said to himself , \u2018 a president of the United States shouldn \u2019 t attack somebody personally when their daughter is sitting in the audience , \u2019 \u201d Newt Gingrich told Sean Hannity on Thursday . \u201c And he bit his tongue , and he was a gentleman , and I thought in many ways that was the most important moment of the whole evening . He proved that he had the discipline to remain as a decent guy even when she was disgusting . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also lamented that the billionaire has gotten short-changed .\n\u201c I thought he was a complete gentleman to her and he has n't gotten a lot of credit for that , \u201d Conway said on \u201c The View \u201d during a brutal discussion with the hosts , who piled on , challenging Conway \u2019 s defenses of Trump .\nAt one point , Whoopi Goldberg even shot back at Conway , \u201c Kellyanne , honey , I \u2019 m a New Yorker . Do n't B.S . a B.S.-er . \u201d\nConway , throughout the interview , tried to thread the needle of justifying Trump \u2019 s campaign , even while not fully endorsing some of his actions , including the threats to go after Bill Clinton \u2019 s sex scandals from the 1990s .\n\u201c I 'm not advising him to go there , \u201d Conway said , while adding , \u201c it 's fair game to think about how Hillary Clinton treated those women after the fact . \u201d",
