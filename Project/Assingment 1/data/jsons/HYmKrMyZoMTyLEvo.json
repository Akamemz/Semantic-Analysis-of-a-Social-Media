    "content": "President Trump and congressional Democratic leaders ripped off the bandage over their raw , partisan disagreements Tuesday in open bickering that offered a glimpse of the divided government to come in the next two years .\nDuring a White House meeting intended to seek common ground to avoid a partial government shutdown next week , the president and incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer instead squabbled over funding for the border wall , traded blame for the last shutdown and jousted over which party commands the stronger political hand since the midterm elections .\n\u201c Unfortunately , this has spiraled downward , \u201d Mrs. Pelosi told the president as their quarreling grew more intense in the Oval Office , which was adorned incongruously with festive holiday decorations .\nMost of the feuding played out on camera in front of reporters who were invited by the president to cover the meeting . The Democrats pleaded with Mr. Trump several times to kick out the press .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s debate in private , \u201d Mr. Schumer urged as cameras continued to roll .\nThe stormy session ended \u2014 at least the public portion of it \u2014 with the president declaring he would be \u201c proud \u201d to shut down parts of the government if he doesn \u2019 t get more funding for the wall .\n\u201c I will take the mantle of shutting down , and I \u2019 m going to shut it down for border security , \u201d said Mr. Trump , who uttered the phrase \u201c border security \u201d 29 times in 18 minutes .\nThe White House later called the meeting \u201c constructive , \u201d although press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders acknowledged that \u201c major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency . \u201d\n\u201c So far , the Democrat Party has made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open , \u201d she said . \u201c President Trump was grateful for the opportunity to let the press into the meeting so that the American people can see firsthand that while Republicans are fighting to protect our border , Democrats are fighting to protect illegal immigrants . This administration will always put Americans first . \u201d\nMr. Schumer referred to the president \u2019 s behavior as a \u201c temper tantrum. \u201d Mrs. Pelosi later reportedly told colleagues that Mr. Trump \u2019 s insistence on the border wall is \u201c a manhood thing . \u201d\nThe president called Mrs. Pelosi later in the day and discussed a way forward but reached no agreement , her office said .\nThe meeting was the first for Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders since Democrats won the House majority Nov. 6 and Republicans bucked the midterm trend by adding two seats to their Senate majority . Expectations were low , with Mr. Trump continuing to call for $ 5 billion in border-wall funding opposed by Democrats , and Mr. Schumer announcing that any infrastructure legislation next year must include provisions addressing climate change , a certain non-starter with the president .\nAdding to the mix were Democrats \u2019 calls in recent days for Mr. Trump to face impeachment or indictment over alleged campaign-finance violations involving hush-money payments to two women who say they had affairs with him .\nThe hostile relations between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats are expected to spread far beyond fights over illegal immigration and border security , potentially bringing the president \u2019 s legislative agenda to a grinding halt . House committees are ready to start numerous investigations and subpoena administration officials .\nThe president started off the meeting by opening it to the press , despite the session having been listed as closed on his schedule . He quickly brought up the border wall , joking that it would be \u201c the easiest of all \u201d the challenges facing them .\n\u201c What do you think , Chuck ? Maybe not ? \u201d the president asked , perched on the edge of his wing chair close to Mr. Schumer .\n\u201c It \u2019 s called \u2018 funding the government , \u2019 Mr. President , \u201d the New York Democrat replied coolly .\nAfter reciting statistics about the effectiveness of sections of border wall preventing illegal immigration , the president turned to Mrs. Pelosi , who emphasized the need to avoid a government shutdown .\n\u201c You should not have a \u2018 Trump shutdown , \u2019 \u201d she told the president .\n\u201c I was going to call it a \u2018 Pelosi shutdown , \u2019 \u201d the president retorted .\nThen the gloves came off , as the lawmakers argued with the president over whether he could gain enough votes for the wall in the current Republican-led House , and Mr. Trump saying it was futile because Senate Democrats would block it from receiving the necessary 60 votes .\nAs the president spoke animatedly about the border wall , the Democratic leaders frequently avoided his gaze . Vice President Mike Pence sat silently in a wing chair next to the president , taking in the arguments .\nMr. Schumer interrupted at one point to tell the president , \u201c The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of \u2018 Pinocchios \u2019 because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built and how much is there. \u201d It was a reference to the newspaper \u2019 s feature of evaluating the truthfulness of public officials \u2019 statements .\nAs the feuding went on , Mrs. Pelosi tried to end it .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s call a halt to this , \u201d she told the president . \u201c We \u2019 ve come in here as the first branch of government : Article I , the legislative branch . We \u2019 re coming in , in good faith , to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open . \u201d\nWhen Mrs. Pelosi reminded the president that Democrats had won back the House , Mr. Trump replied , \u201c And we \u2019 ve gained in the Senate . \u201d\nMr. Schumer taunted , \u201c When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana , he \u2019 s in real trouble . \u201d\n\u201c I did , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We did win North Dakota . \u201d\nMr. Trump also appeared to irritate Mrs. Pelosi by referring to her tenuous , unfinished bid to attract enough Democratic support to be elected House speaker .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we really disagree so much , \u201d the president said . \u201c I also know that , you know , Nancy is in a situation where it \u2019 s not easy for her to talk right now , and I fully understand that . \u201d\nShe bristled at Mr. Trump , \u201c Please don \u2019 t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory . \u201d\nThe president , who has often opened up meetings to the press that other presidents would not have , seemed to enjoy the Democrats \u2019 discomfort at airing their legislative laundry in front of journalists .\nMrs. Pelosi complained , \u201c This is the most unfortunate thing . We came in here in good faith , and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view . \u201d\n\u201c But it \u2019 s not bad , Nancy , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c It \u2019 s called transparency . \u201d\nTurning again to a possible shutdown , Mr. Trump warned Mr. Schumer , \u201c You don \u2019 t want to shut down the government , Chuck . \u201d\n\u201c Let me just finish , \u201d Mr. Schumer told the president . \u201c Because you can \u2019 t get your way . \u201d\nMr. Trump replied , \u201c Because the last time you shut it down , you got killed . \u201d\nDespite the bickering in front of TV cameras , Mr. Trump later said the meeting went well after the press left the room .\n\u201c Believe it or not I think it was a very friendly meeting , \u201d he told reporters at another White House event . \u201c I \u2019 ve actually liked them for a long period of time and I respect them both and we made a lot of progress . \u201d\nThe president cited progress on a farm bill , and an upcoming Senate vote on a criminal justice reform bill as examples of bipartisan agreement .\nThe president , whose biggest campaign promise in 2016 was building the wall , said he believes he can \u2019 t lose on the issue .\n\u201c If we have to close down the country over border security , I actually like that in terms of an issue , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s something the country needs .
