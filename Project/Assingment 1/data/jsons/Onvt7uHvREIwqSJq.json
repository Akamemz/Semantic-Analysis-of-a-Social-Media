Mrs. Clinton presented herself as the experienced , hyper-informed , trailblazing adult in the room throughout the evening , directing almost all of her verbal punches at Republicans . Only once did she directly attack one of her rivals : Bernie Sanders , ( predictably ) on gun control , perhaps the only issue on which she can credibly outflank him to the left . In spite of her hedging on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and marijuana legalization , extremely weak answers on Libya and trade , and unresponsive dismissiveness on her burgeoning email scandal ( her denunciation of Edward Snowden for his handling of sensitive information was quite rich ) , Clinton won the debate . She established herself as the only plausible nominee on the stage -- benefitting greatly , I suspect , from Bernie Sanders ' performance in the long run . He 'll delight his base ( ) and raise a lot of small donor money , but many Democratic voters will ultimately recognize that he 's unelectable in a general election . She was prepared and polished ; he was passionate , but a bit frazzled , appearing to lose is train of thought on several occasions . Remember , it took an extremely skilled communicator and a dynamic debater to upend Hillary Clinton in 2008 , effectively and authentically taking her apart from the left without alienating the general electorate . Nobody on that stage tonight is capable of beating her in the same way this cycle . On the issue that exemplifies her weaknesses as a candidate -- her ongoing , national security-compromising email scandal -- Clinton 's closest competitor gamely let her off the hook , casting the issue as a distraction from real issues . The email saga underlines her arrogant posture toward laws and rules , her reckless disregard for national security protocols designed to keep our most sensitive secrets away from prying eyes , and her propensity to lie -- often and shamelessly . Bernie Sanders chose to circle the wagons . He 's unwilling to do what it takes to defeat her , while she again and again telegraphed her election strategy of playing the gender card without even a nod at subtlety : With respect , the other men on stage are afterthoughts . Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley may have helped himself a bit , hammering away at Republicans and the NRA throughout the evening . His numbers might bounce a little , but they 're prohibitively low , and this was n't a breakout performance . Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb challenged the presiding hard-left winds on guns , on the Iran deal , on energy , and on executive power . He 's far too centrist to have a prayer in today 's Democratic Party . Rhode Island 's resident Republican-cum-Independent-cum-Democrat Lincoln Chafee was awful . Interestingly , one name that was n't uttered once : Joe Biden . If the sitting Vice President is planning to jump into the race , he 'd better get on with it . He 's the only person who seems like a long-run threat to Hillary Clinton , who used tonight 's first ( of just six ) Democratic debates to reassure jittery members of her party that she 'll be fine .

Tick tock , Mr. Vice President.CNN 's Anderson Cooper delivered a strong barrage of opening questions , pressing each candidate on major weaknesses . This debate was n't especially tightly produced , and the video questions element was clunky and unnecessary , but Cooper 's questioning and follow-ups were mainly solid .
