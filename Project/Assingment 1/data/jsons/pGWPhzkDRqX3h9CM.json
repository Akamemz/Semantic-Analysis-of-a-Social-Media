    "content": "Congress is returning to Washington with several divisive fights looming over the 2019 agenda .\nThe first year of divided government under the Trump administration will set up a clash between Senate Republicans , who expanded their majority , and House Democrats ready to challenge the administration .\nThe 2020 election will also cast an increasingly long shadow as President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Warren goes local in race to build 2020 movement 2020 Democrats make play for veterans ' votes MORE gears up to run for reelection and a boatload of Democrats ready presidential campaigns .\nEnding a partial government shutdown will be the first piece of business . Here \u2019 s what to watch for .\nRoughly 25 percent of the federal government has been closed since Dec. 22 amid a protracted fight over Trump \u2019 s demands for $ 5 billion in funding for a wall on the Mexican border .\nThe shutdown came after Trump , under fire from conservatives , refused to support a Senate-passed seven-week bill that provided no extra money for the border . House Republicans , instead , passed a seven-week stopgap bill that included $ 5.7 billion for the wall and border security .\nHouse Democrats plan to pass a bill to fully reopen the government when they take power on Thursday . Their plan is to approve a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would continue existing funding through Feb. 8 . They would also pass a package of six other bills funding the remaining closed parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year .\nThe move would kick the fight back to the Senate and force Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham : Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower ' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE ( R-Ky. ) to decide whether to move a bill without Trump \u2019 s support . Another question ? Whether Trump would sign such a deal .\nBehind the scenes , there has been talk about a deal in which Trump would lower his demands to roughly $ 2.5 billion . That would be in exchange for Democrats , who previously rejected a two-year deal that would have given Trump $ 2.5 billion in 2019 , backing down from their hardline of $ 1.3 billion for fencing .\nSuch a deal would hinge on wording that would allow both sides to save face , meaning funding would need to go to fencing or other security measures falling short of a wall . They would also need to iron out an agreement on what restrictions to include on the funding , with the White House pushing for wide leeway on how they can use it .\nTrump \u2019 s Cabinet reshuffling will set up several fights in the Senate as lawmakers work to confirm his picks .\nDefense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisFormer Mattis staffer : Trump 'shooting himself in the foot ' on foreign policy Former staffer hits back at Mattis 's office over criticism of tell-all book Former speechwriter for General James Mattis : Has the national security state grappled with Donald Trump ?
