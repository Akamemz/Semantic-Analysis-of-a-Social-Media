The lingering glitch could cause major problems weeks down the road , resulting in people thinking they 've signed up when insurance companies have no record of them doing so .\nThese so-called `` back-end '' problems were largely glossed over when federal health officials confidently claimed over the weekend they had met their own goals for improving the website by Dec. 1 .\nAdministration officials said early Sunday that they have fixed roughly 400 computer `` bugs '' and increased capacity so the site can now handle more than 800,000 users daily with an error rate of less than 1 percent . Jeff Zients , the official appointed to fix the ObamaCare site since its disastrous Oct. 1 rollout , said it is `` night and day from what it was .
