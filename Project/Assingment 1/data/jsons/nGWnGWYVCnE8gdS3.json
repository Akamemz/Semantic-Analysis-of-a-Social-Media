    "content": "Donald Trump will not be the Republican presidential nominee in 2016 . He does not have the infrastructure , he does not have the organization , he does not have the discipline . So why are so many Republican ThoughtLeaders intent on casting him from the race like a leper ?\nWhy does Senator Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) say that Trump should be \u201c disqualified \u201d from the race ? Why does Governor Rick Perry ( R-TX ) say that Trump is a \u201c cancer on conservatism \u201d that must be \u201c discarded , \u201d a \u201c barking carnival act \u201d ? Why does Senator John McCain ( R-AZ ) deride Trump \u2019 s supporters as \u201c crazies , \u201d while the rest of the Republican establishment nods silently ?\nThe answer , of course , is no . Alienating Trump \u2019 s voting base will lead Trump to run third party , destroying any opportunity for Republicans to beat Hillary Clinton . Establishment characters calling curses from the heavens down upon Trump grants him credibility with the same group of conservatives who believe that establishment attacks are a badge of honor . If those conservatives feel Trump is treated unfairly , it will widen the gap between the donors in the Republican Party and the base of the Republican Party .\nRepublicans should , instead , see Trump \u2019 s presence in the race as a grand opportunity . That \u2019 s because it is an opportunity . Here are seven reasons why :\nTrump Is A Stalking Horse . Let \u2019 s imagine that you could design a candidate who would draw nearly 100 % of the media attention at the beginning of a race , long before polls mattered or primaries were scheduled to take place . Let \u2019 s also imagine that this candidate had no real shot at winning any of those primaries , and that the candidate would eventually either blow himself out or fade away after the curiosity factor worked its way through the public system . Wouldn \u2019 t you , as a rival candidate , beg for such a candidate to enter the race ? After all , it would give you the ability to raise money quietly , do grassroots work without media scrutiny ; it would force the media to lavish its attention on your rivals across the political aisle while spending their focus on this Big Name Candidate . That candidate is Trump . According to polls from Colorado , Iowa , and Virginia this week , Hillary Clinton loses to Rubio , Governor Scott Walker ( R-WI ) , and former Governor Jeb Bush ( R-FL ) . Does that happen if the media spend all their time and effort debunking those three candidates ? Or does it happen because the media are so distracted by Trump that the other three get an opportunity to fly under the radar ? Barack Obama was able to use Hillary Clinton \u2019 s high name recognition in 2008 to fly under the radar all the way to the nomination ; by the time Hillary tried to define him , it was too late . Other Republicans could do the same here .\nTrump Generates Attention . Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani recently pointed out , \u201c Trump is in that debate , it \u2019 s going to get three times the audience. \u201d That \u2019 s exactly right . Primary debates aren \u2019 t exclusively designed to help Republicans pick their candidate \u2013 the debates are also designed to allow future general election voters to get first impressions of the other candidates . The more direct contact between voters and candidates without the filter of the media , the better . Furthermore , Republicans have been caught in the vice of media malpractice when it comes to issues like illegal immigration : the media won \u2019 t cover such issues unless a Republican makes a mistake , in which case the cameras descend en masse . Trump solves that conundrum : he says outrageous things , the media show up , and the other candidates get a chance to speak rationally on topics the media nearly always ignore . Never underestimate the benefit of someone who can bring busloads of media down to Laredo , Texas just to listen to him talk .\nTrump Draws Contrast With Other Candidates . So , you don \u2019 t like Trump . Then you should love Trump in the race , given that he offers the greatest opportunity to his rivals to draw a contrast . Senator Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) is charmless and vanilla as a politician \u2013 and even he has become likeable in response to Trump . If Governor Rick Perry ( R-TX ) seeks to become a beloved figure in mainstream media circles , all he has to do is continue to attack Trump . If Jeb Bush doesn \u2019 t like Trump \u2019 s position on immigration , Trump provides him a painless opportunity for a Sister Souljah moment . Free debate is the essence of primary season . Embrace it , or fall to the power of Trump .\nTrump Attacks The Media . In 2012 , Newt Gingrich played the designated anti-media attack dog . He did it well , and he did it effectively : it moved him to the top of the polls . Trump does the same now . He has rhetorically punched members of the media ranging from CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper to MSNBC and Telemundo \u2019 s Jose Diaz Balart . He seems uncowed by media pressure \u2013 in fact , he embraces it . Were Trump not attacking the media , someone else would have to do it . Thankfully , other Republicans like Carly Fiorina have jumped on the anti-media bandwagon , and are punching just as effectively \u2013 or even more effectively \u2013 than The Donald .\nTrump Channels Anger . Republicans seem pathologically fearful of the anger of their base . Taught by the media that \u201c angry white men \u201d can not fuel a party , they instead insist that they will out-compassion the left , a foolhardy proposition given that the left \u2019 s only calling card is compassion . Never mind that the left has consistently fueled its campaigns with rage against George W. Bush , \u201c white privilege , \u201d sexism , and other built-up monsters . The right has internalized criticisms that it must never humor the justified anger of its base . Not Trump . Trump embraces the feeling of frustration from the base , and does so in unapologetic fashion . That unapologetic nature is attractive to conservatives who feel as though they have elected Republicans , then watched those same Republicans surrender again and again . Other Republicans should watch Trump \u2019 s outrage-channeling and take notes .\nTrump Doesn \u2019 t Buy Into Foolish Demographic Arguments . For years , the establishment Republicans have been telling the base to shut up on immigration ; if they don \u2019 t , the argument goes , then Hispanics will vote heavily Democrat , shutting Republicans out of political power . Immediately after the 2012 election , for example , Charles Krauthammer wrote , \u201c They should be a natural Republican constituency : striving immigrant community , religious , Catholic , family-oriented and socially conservative ( on abortion , for example ) . The principle reason they go Democratic is the issue of illegal immigrants. \u201d This is nonsense . Hispanic immigrants lean heavily left on most major issues . More importantly , running from the immigration issue , and thereby alienating the Republican base , doesn \u2019 t move Republicans closer to victory : Mitt Romney could have won 69 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 and still have lost . Romney lost not because Hispanics didn \u2019 t vote his way , but because white turnout was too low , and because he didn \u2019 t drive outsized turnout from Evangelical Christians , among others . As Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics told Politico today , \u201c Certainly the GOP shouldn \u2019 t be antagonistic to Hispanics , but the big question is how much outreach should they do before they start to turn off working-class white voters . Because from an Electoral College numbers perspective , the net gain in embracing some form of immigration reform just isn \u2019 t there . \u201d\nTrump Doesn \u2019 t Suck Money Out Of The Race . For all the talk of Trump as a distraction , he certainly doesn \u2019 t suck money out of the Republican race : in his last FEC filing , filed last week , Trump had drawn just over 60 donors . He \u2019 s self-funding .\nTrump is doing a lot of good for the Republican Party in terms of exposure , media misdirection , and issue-raising ; he \u2019 s firing up the base , allowing his opponents to draw contrasts with him , and he \u2019 s doing it all without tapping out those who want to give cash . If Republicans can \u2019 t beat him , what chance do they have of touching Hillary Clinton ? They ought to stop whining and start taking notes \u2013 or at least making hay while the media sun shines on The Donald .\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of the book , The People vs. Barack Obama : The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration ( Threshold Editions , June 10 , 2014 ) .
