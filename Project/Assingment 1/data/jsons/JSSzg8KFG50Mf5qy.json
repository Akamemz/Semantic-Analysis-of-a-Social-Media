The New Hampshire Republican Party is ferocious about its traditional status as host of the nation \u2019 s first presidential primary , which can make and break candidates and create a media ruckus . So , naturally , there \u2019 s a First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit which began Friday \u2014 and the GOP giants can \u2019 t wait to get there .
