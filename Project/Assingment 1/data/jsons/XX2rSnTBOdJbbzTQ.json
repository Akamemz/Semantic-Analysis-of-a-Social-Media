    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- Anger , frustration and calls for action echoed around the NBA on Saturday after an audio recording surfaced of a man identified as Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to games .\nEverybody except for the embattled Clippers owner , who has a decades-long history of alleged discrimination and offensive behavior , seemed to have a response .\nThe league said it was investigating the recording posted on TMZ 's website , calling the comments `` disturbing and offensive . ''\nPresident Barack Obama , asked to respond at a news conference with Malaysia 's prime minister during Obama 's visit to the country Sunday , called the reported remarks `` incredibly offensive racist statements . ''\n`` I do n't think I have to interpret those statements for you , they kind of speak for themselves , '' Obama said . `` When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance , you do n't really have to do anything . You just let them talk . And that 's what happened here . ''\nObama also expressed confidence the NBA would address the situation , and said the United States still wrestles with `` the legacy of race and slavery and segregation . ''\n`` Obviously , the NBA is a league that is beloved by fans all across the country , '' Obama said . `` It 's got an awful lot of African-American players . It 's steeped in African-American culture . And , I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this . ''\nLakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson , a target of Sterling 's remarks , said he would n't attend Clippers games as long as Sterling was the owner . Miami Heat star LeBron James asked new NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to take aggressive measures , saying `` there is no room for Donald Sterling in our league . ''\n`` Obviously , if the reports are true , it 's unacceptable in our league , '' James said . `` It does n't matter , white , black or Hispanic - all across the races it 's unacceptable . As the commissioner of our league , they have to make a stand . They have to be very aggressive with it . I do n't know what it will be , but we ca n't have that in our league . ''\nSilver spoke Saturday night in Memphis , Tenn. , before the Grizzlies ' game against Oklahoma City , repeating that the league finds the audio tape `` disturbing and offensive '' and that Sterling agreed to not attend the Clippers ' game Sunday at Golden State .\n`` All members of the NBA family should be afforded due process and a fair opportunity to present their side of any controversy , which is why I 'm not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against Donald Sterling , '' Silver said . `` We will , however , move extraordinarily quickly in our investigation . ''\nSilver said the NBA needs to confirm authenticity of the audio tape and interview both Sterling and the woman in the recording . The Clippers will be back in Los Angeles for Game 5 on Tuesday night .\n`` We do hope to have this wrapped up in the next few days , '' Silver said .\nClippers coach Doc Rivers said players discussed boycotting Game 4 of their first-round playoff series during a 45-minute team meeting but quickly decided against it .\n`` I think the biggest statement we can make as men , not as black men , as men , is to stick together and show how strong we are as a group , '' Rivers said . `` Not splinter . Not walk . It 's easy to protest . The protest will be in our play . ''\nClippers President Andy Roeser said in a statement that the team did not know if the tape is legitimate or has been altered . He said the woman on the tape , identified by TMZ as V. Stiviano , `` is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $ 1.8 million , who told Mr. Sterling that she would ` get even . ' ''\nRoeser also said the recording does not reflect Sterling 's beliefs . He added that Sterling is `` upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him '' about Johnson , whom he called Sterling 's friend .\nIn the recording posted on TMZ , the man questions his girlfriend 's association with minorities . TMZ reported Stiviano , who is of black and Mexican descent , posted a picture of herself with Johnson on Instagram - which has since been removed .\nThe man asked Stiviano not to broadcast her association with black people or bring black people to games . The man specifically mentioned Johnson on the recording , saying `` do n't bring him to my games , OK ? ''\n`` I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner , '' Johnson responded on Twitter . He also said the alleged comments are `` a black eye for the NBA '' and said he felt bad that friends such as Rivers and Clippers point guard Chris Paul had to work for Sterling .\nPaul released a statement through the players ' union that said `` this is a very serious issue which we will address aggressively . '' He also said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson , a former NBA All-Star guard who is the chairman of a search committee to find a new director for the union , would take a leading role to help players address the matter .\nPaul and Clippers All-Star forward Blake Griffin declined further comment on the issue after the team 's practice at the University of San Francisco .
