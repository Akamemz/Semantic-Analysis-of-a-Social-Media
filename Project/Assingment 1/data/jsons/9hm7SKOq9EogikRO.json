Others warn that its broad scope and the long list of progressive social programs it endorses could hinder its climate efforts.\n\nSo what is the Green New Deal?\n\nThe proposal outlines the broad principles of a plan simultaneously to fight inequity and tackle climate change. It does not contain policy details or advocate for specific ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But with a broad brush it aims to begin to make the US carbon-neutral \u2013 net zero carbon emissions \u2013 in 10 years.\n\nThe Green New Deal recognizes that transition would require massive change.
