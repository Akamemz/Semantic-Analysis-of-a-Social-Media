    "content": "Democracies end when they are too democratic . And right now , America is a breeding ground for tyranny .\nAs this dystopian election campaign has unfolded , my mind keeps being tugged by a passage in Plato \u2019 s Republic . It has unsettled \u2014 even surprised \u2014 me from the moment I first read it in graduate school . The passage is from the part of the dialogue where Socrates and his friends are talking about the nature of different political systems , how they change over time , and how one can slowly evolve into another . And Socrates seemed pretty clear on one sobering point : that \u201c tyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy. \u201d What did Plato mean by that ? Democracy , for him , I discovered , was a political system of maximal freedom and equality , where every lifestyle is allowed and public offices are filled by a lottery . And the longer a democracy lasted , Plato argued , the more democratic it would become . Its freedoms would multiply ; its equality spread . Deference to any sort of authority would wither ; tolerance of any kind of inequality would come under intense threat ; and multiculturalism and sexual freedom would create a city or a country like \u201c a many-colored cloak decorated in all hues . \u201d\nThis rainbow-flag polity , Plato argues , is , for many people , the fairest of regimes . The freedom in that democracy has to be experienced to be believed \u2014 with shame and privilege in particular emerging over time as anathema . But it is inherently unstable . As the authority of elites fades , as Establishment values cede to popular ones , views and identities can become so magnificently diverse as to be mutually uncomprehending . And when all the barriers to equality , formal and informal , have been removed ; when everyone is equal ; when elites are despised and full license is established to do \u201c whatever one wants , \u201d you arrive at what might be called late-stage democracy . There is no kowtowing to authority here , let alone to political experience or expertise .\nThe very rich come under attack , as inequality becomes increasingly intolerable . Patriarchy is also dismantled : \u201c We almost forgot to mention the extent of the law of equality and of freedom in the relations of women with men and men with women. \u201d Family hierarchies are inverted : \u201c A father habituates himself to be like his child and fear his sons , and a son habituates himself to be like his father and to have no shame before or fear of his parents. \u201d In classrooms , \u201c as the teacher ... is frightened of the pupils and fawns on them , so the students make light of their teachers. \u201d Animals are regarded as equal to humans ; the rich mingle freely with the poor in the streets and try to blend in . The foreigner is equal to the citizen .\nAnd it is when a democracy has ripened as fully as this , Plato argues , that a would-be tyrant will often seize his moment .\nHe is usually of the elite but has a nature in tune with the time \u2014 given over to random pleasures and whims , feasting on plenty of food and sex , and reveling in the nonjudgment that is democracy \u2019 s civil religion . He makes his move by \u201c taking over a particularly obedient mob \u201d and attacking his wealthy peers as corrupt . If not stopped quickly , his appetite for attacking the rich on behalf of the people swells further . He is a traitor to his class \u2014 and soon , his elite enemies , shorn of popular legitimacy , find a way to appease him or are forced to flee . Eventually , he stands alone , promising to cut through the paralysis of democratic incoherence . It \u2019 s as if he were offering the addled , distracted , and self-indulgent citizens a kind of relief from democracy \u2019 s endless choices and insecurities . He rides a backlash to excess\u2014 \u201c too much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery \u201d \u2014 and offers himself as the personified answer to the internal conflicts of the democratic mess . He pledges , above all , to take on the increasingly despised elites . And as the people thrill to him as a kind of solution , a democracy willingly , even impetuously , repeals itself .\nAnd so , as I chitchatted over cocktails at a Washington office Christmas party in December , and saw , looming above our heads , the pulsating , angry televised face of Donald Trump on Fox News , I couldn \u2019 t help but feel a little nausea permeate my stomach . And as I watched frenzied Trump rallies on C-SPAN in the spring , and saw him lay waste to far more qualified political peers in the debates by simply calling them names , the nausea turned to dread . And when he seemed to condone physical violence as a response to political disagreement , alarm bells started to ring in my head . Plato had planted a gnawing worry in my mind a few decades ago about the intrinsic danger of late-democratic life . It was increasingly hard not to see in Plato \u2019 s vision a murky reflection of our own hyperdemocratic times and in Trump a demagogic , tyrannical character plucked directly out of one of the first books about politics ever written .\nCould it be that the Donald has emerged from the populist circuses of pro wrestling and New York City tabloids , via reality television and Twitter , to prove not just Plato but also James Madison right , that democracies \u201c have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention \u2026 and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths \u201d ? Is he testing democracy \u2019 s singular weakness \u2014 its susceptibility to the demagogue \u2014 by blasting through the firewalls we once had in place to prevent such a person from seizing power ? Or am I overreacting ?\nPerhaps . The nausea comes and goes , and there have been days when the news algorithm has actually reassured me that \u201c peak Trump \u201d has arrived . But it hasn \u2019 t gone away , and neither has Trump . In the wake of his most recent primary triumphs , at a time when he is perilously close to winning enough delegates to grab the Republican nomination outright , I think we must confront this dread and be clear about what this election has already revealed about the fragility of our way of life and the threat late-stage democracy is beginning to pose to itself .\nPlato , of course , was not clairvoyant . His analysis of how democracy can turn into tyranny is a complex one more keyed toward ancient societies than our own ( and contains more wrinkles and eddies than I can summarize here ) . His disdain for democratic life was fueled in no small part by the fact that a democracy had executed his mentor , Socrates . And he would , I think , have been astonished at how American democracy has been able to thrive with unprecedented stability over the last couple of centuries even as it has brought more and more people into its embrace . It remains , in my view , a miracle of constitutional craftsmanship and cultural resilience . There is no place I would rather live . But it is not immortal , nor should we assume it is immune to the forces that have endangered democracy so many times in human history .\nPart of American democracy \u2019 s stability is owed to the fact that the Founding Fathers had read their Plato . To guard our democracy from the tyranny of the majority and the passions of the mob , they constructed large , hefty barriers between the popular will and the exercise of power . Voting rights were tightly circumscribed . The president and vice-president were not to be popularly elected but selected by an Electoral College , whose representatives were selected by the various states , often through state legislatures . The Senate \u2019 s structure ( with two members from every state ) was designed to temper the power of the more populous states , and its term of office ( six years , compared with two for the House ) was designed to cool and restrain temporary populist passions . The Supreme Court , picked by the president and confirmed by the Senate , was the final bulwark against any democratic furies that might percolate up from the House and threaten the Constitution . This separation of powers was designed precisely to create sturdy firewalls against democratic wildfires .\nOver the centuries , however , many of these undemocratic rules have been weakened or abolished . The franchise has been extended far beyond propertied white men . The presidency is now effectively elected through popular vote , with the Electoral College almost always reflecting the national democratic will . And these formal democratic advances were accompanied by informal ones , as the culture of democracy slowly took deeper root . For a very long time , only the elites of the political parties came to select their candidates at their quadrennial conventions , with the vote largely restricted to party officials from the various states ( and often decided in , yes , smoke-filled rooms in large hotel suites ) . Beginning in the early 1900s , however , the parties began experimenting with primaries , and after the chaos of the 1968 Democratic convention , today \u2019 s far more democratic system became the norm .\nDirect democracy didn \u2019 t just elect Congress and the president anymore ; it expanded the notion of who might be qualified for public office . Once , candidates built a career through experience in elected or Cabinet positions or as military commanders ; they were effectively selected by peer review . That elitist sorting mechanism has slowly imploded . In 1940 , Wendell Willkie , a businessman with no previous political office , won the Republican nomination for president , pledging to keep America out of war and boasting that his personal wealth inoculated him against corruption : \u201c I will be under obligation to nobody except the people. \u201d He lost badly to Franklin D. Roosevelt , but nonetheless , since then , nonpolitical candidates have proliferated , from Ross Perot and Jesse Jackson , to Steve Forbes and Herman Cain , to this year \u2019 s crop of Ben Carson , Carly Fiorina , and , of course , Donald J. Trump . This further widening of our democracy \u2014 our increased openness to being led by anyone ; indeed , our accelerating preference for outsiders \u2014 is now almost complete .\nThe barriers to the popular will , especially when it comes to choosing our president , are now almost nonexistent . In 2000 , George W. Bush lost the popular vote and won the election thanks to Electoral College math and , more egregiously , to a partisan Supreme Court vote . Al Gore \u2019 s eventual concession spared the nation a constitutional crisis , but the episode generated widespread unease , not just among Democrats . And this year , the delegate system established by our political parties is also under assault . Trump has argued that the candidate with the most votes should get the Republican nomination , regardless of the rules in place . It now looks as if he won \u2019 t even need to win that argument \u2014 that he \u2019 ll bank enough delegates to secure the nomination uncontested \u2014 but he \u2019 s won it anyway . Fully half of Americans now believe the traditional nominating system is rigged .\nMany contend , of course , that American democracy is actually in retreat , close to being destroyed by the vastly more unequal economy of the last quarter-century and the ability of the very rich to purchase political influence . This is Bernie Sanders \u2019 s core critique . But the past few presidential elections have demonstrated that , in fact , money from the ultrarich has been mostly a dud . Barack Obama , whose 2008 campaign was propelled by small donors and empowered by the internet , blazed the trail of the modern-day insurrectionist , defeating the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and later his Republican opponent ( both pillars of their parties \u2019 Establishments and backed by moneyed elites ) . In 2012 , the fund-raising power behind Mitt Romney \u2014 avatar of the one percent \u2014 failed to dislodge Obama from office . And in this presidential cycle , the breakout candidates of both parties have soared without financial support from the elites . Sanders , who is sustaining his campaign all the way to California on the backs of small donors and large crowds , is , to put it bluntly , a walking refutation of his own argument . Trump , of course , is a largely self-funding billionaire \u2014 but like Willkie , he argues that his wealth uniquely enables him to resist the influence of the rich and their lobbyists . Those despairing over the influence of Big Money in American politics must also explain the swift , humiliating demise of Jeb Bush and the struggling Establishment campaign of Hillary Clinton . The evidence suggests that direct democracy , far from being throttled , is actually intensifying its grip on American politics .\nNone of this is necessarily cause for alarm , even though it would be giving the Founding Fathers palpitations . The emergence of the first black president \u2014 unimaginable before our more inclusive democracy \u2014 is miraculous , a strengthening , rather than weakening , of the system . The days when party machines just fixed things or rigged elections are mercifully done with . The way in which outsider candidates , from Obama to Trump and Sanders , have brought millions of new people into the electoral process is an unmitigated advance . The inclusion of previously excluded voices helps , rather than impedes , our public deliberation . But it is precisely because of the great accomplishments of our democracy that we should be vigilant about its specific , unique vulnerability : its susceptibility , in stressful times , to the appeal of a shameless demagogue .\nWhat the 21st century added to this picture , it \u2019 s now blindingly obvious , was media democracy \u2014 in a truly revolutionary form . If late-stage political democracy has taken two centuries to ripen , the media equivalent took around two decades , swiftly erasing almost any elite moderation or control of our democratic discourse . The process had its origins in partisan talk radio at the end of the past century . The rise of the internet \u2014 an event so swift and pervasive its political effect is only now beginning to be understood \u2014 further democratized every source of information , dramatically expanded each outlet \u2019 s readership , and gave everyone a platform . All the old barriers to entry \u2014 the cost of print and paper and distribution \u2014 crumbled .\nSo much of this was welcome . I relished it myself in the early aughts , starting a blog and soon reaching as many readers , if not more , as some small magazines do . Fusty old-media institutions , grown fat and lazy , deserved a drubbing . The early independent blogosphere corrected facts , exposed bias , earned scoops . And as the medium matured , and as Facebook and Twitter took hold , everyone became a kind of blogger . In ways no 20th-century journalist would have believed , we all now have our own virtual newspapers on our Facebook newsfeeds and Twitter timelines \u2014 picking stories from countless sources and creating a peer-to-peer media almost completely free of editing or interference by elites . This was bound to make politics more fluid . Political organizing \u2014 calling a meeting , fomenting a rally to advance a cause \u2014 used to be extremely laborious . Now you could bring together a virtual mass movement with a single webpage . It would take you a few seconds .\nThe web was also uniquely capable of absorbing other forms of media , conflating genres and categories in ways never seen before . The distinction between politics and entertainment became fuzzier ; election coverage became even more modeled on sportscasting ; your Pornhub jostled right next to your mother \u2019 s Facebook page . The web \u2019 s algorithms all but removed any editorial judgment , and the effect soon had cable news abandoning even the pretense of asking \u201c Is this relevant ? \u201d or \u201c Do we really need to cover this live ? \u201d in the rush toward ratings bonanzas . In the end , all these categories were reduced to one thing : traffic , measured far more accurately than any other medium had ever done before .\nAnd what mainly fuels this is precisely what the Founders feared about democratic culture : feeling , emotion , and narcissism , rather than reason , empiricism , and public-spiritedness . Online debates become personal , emotional , and irresolvable almost as soon as they begin . Godwin \u2019 s Law \u2014 it \u2019 s only a matter of time before a comments section brings up Hitler \u2014 is a reflection of the collapse of the reasoned deliberation the Founders saw as indispensable to a functioning republic .\nYes , occasional rational points still fly back and forth , but there are dramatically fewer elite arbiters to establish which of those points is actually true or valid or relevant . We have lost authoritative sources for even a common set of facts . And without such common empirical ground , the emotional component of politics becomes inflamed and reason retreats even further . The more emotive the candidate , the more supporters he or she will get .\nPolitically , we lucked out at first . Obama would never have been nominated for the presidency , let alone elected , if he hadn \u2019 t harnessed the power of the web and the charisma of his media celebrity . But he was also , paradoxically , a very elite figure , a former state and U.S. senator , a product of Harvard Law School , and , as it turned out , blessed with a preternaturally rational and calm disposition . So he has masked , temporarily , the real risks in the system that his pioneering campaign revealed . Hence many Democrats \u2019 frustration with him . Those who saw in his campaign the seeds of revolutionary change , who were drawn to him by their own messianic delusions , came to be bitterly disappointed by his governing moderation and pragmatism .\nThe climate Obama thrived in , however , was also ripe for far less restrained opportunists . In 2008 , Sarah Palin emerged as proof that an ardent Republican , branded as an outsider , tailor-made for reality TV , proud of her own ignorance about the world , and reaching an audience directly through online media , could also triumph in this new era . She was , it turned out , a John the Baptist for the true messiah of conservative populism , waiting patiently and strategically for his time to come .\nTrump , we now know , had been considering running for president for decades . Those who didn \u2019 t see him coming \u2014 or kept treating him as a joke \u2014 had not yet absorbed the precedents of Obama and Palin or the power of the new wide-open system to change the rules of the political game . Trump was as underrated for all of 2015 as Obama was in 2007 \u2014 and for the same reasons . He intuitively grasped the vanishing authority of American political and media elites , and he had long fashioned a public persona perfectly attuned to blast past them .\nDespite his immense wealth and inherited privilege , Trump had always cultivated a common touch . He did not hide his wealth in the late-20th century \u2014 he flaunted it in a way that connected with the masses . He lived the rich man \u2019 s life most working men dreamed of \u2014 endless glamour and women , for example \u2014 without sacrificing a way of talking about the world that would not be out of place on the construction sites he regularly toured . His was a cult of democratic aspiration . His 1987 book , The Art of the Deal , promised its readers a path to instant success ; his appearances on \u201c The Howard Stern Show \u201d cemented his appeal . His friendship with Vince McMahon offered him an early entr\u00e9e into the world of professional wrestling , with its fusion of sports and fantasy . He was a macho media superstar .\nOne of the more amazing episodes in Sarah Palin \u2019 s early political life , in fact , bears this out . She popped up in the Anchorage Daily News as \u201c a commercial fisherman from Wasilla \u201d on April 3 , 1996 . Palin had told her husband she was going to Costco but had sneaked into J.C. Penney in Anchorage to see \u2026 one Ivana Trump , who , in the wake of her divorce , was touting her branded perfume . \u201c We want to see Ivana , \u201d Palin told the paper , \u201c because we are so desperate in Alaska for any semblance of glamour and culture . \u201d\nTrump assiduously cultivated this image and took to reality television as a natural . Each week , for 14 seasons of The Apprentice , he would look someone in the eye and tell them , \u201c You \u2019 re fired ! \u201d The conversation most humane bosses fear to have with an employee was something Trump clearly relished , and the cruelty became entertainment . In retrospect , it is clear he was training \u2014 both himself and his viewers . If you want to understand why a figure so widely disliked nonetheless powers toward the election as if he were approaching a reality-TV-show finale , look no further . His television tactics , as applied to presidential debates , wiped out rivals used to a different game . And all our reality-TV training has conditioned us to hope he \u2019 ll win \u2014 or at least stay in the game till the final round . In such a shame-free media environment , the assholes often win . In the end , you support them because they \u2019 re assholes .\nIn Eric Hoffer \u2019 s classic 1951 tract , The True Believer , he sketches the dynamics of a genuine mass movement . He was thinking of the upheavals in Europe in the first half of the century , but the book remains sobering , especially now . Hoffer \u2019 s core insight was to locate the source of all truly mass movements in a collective sense of acute frustration . Not despair , or revolt , or resignation \u2014 but frustration simmering with rage . Mass movements , he notes ( as did Tocqueville centuries before him ) , rarely arise when oppression or misery is at its worst ( say , 2009 ) ; they tend to appear when the worst is behind us but the future seems not so much better ( say , 2016 ) . It is when a recovery finally gathers speed and some improvement is tangible but not yet widespread that the anger begins to rise . After the suffering of recession or unemployment , and despite hard work with stagnant or dwindling pay , the future stretches ahead with relief just out of reach . When those who helped create the last recession face no consequences but renewed fabulous wealth , the anger reaches a crescendo .\nThe deeper , long-term reasons for today \u2019 s rage are not hard to find , although many of us elites have shamefully found ourselves able to ignore them . The jobs available to the working class no longer contain the kind of craftsmanship or satisfaction or meaning that can take the sting out of their low and stagnant wages . The once-familiar avenues for socialization \u2014 the church , the union hall , the VFW \u2014 have become less vibrant and social isolation more common . Global economic forces have pummeled blue-collar workers more relentlessly than almost any other segment of society , forcing them to compete against hundreds of millions of equally skilled workers throughout the planet . No one asked them in the 1990s if this was the future they wanted . And the impact has been more brutal than many economists predicted . No wonder suicide and mortality rates among the white working poor are spiking dramatically .\n\u201c It is usually those whose poverty is relatively recent , the \u2018 new poor , \u2019 who throb with the ferment of frustration , \u201d Hoffer argues . Fundamentalist religion long provided some emotional support for those left behind ( for one thing , it invites practitioners to defy the elites as unholy ) , but its influence has waned as modernity has penetrated almost everything and the great culture wars of the 1990s and 2000s have ended in a rout . The result has been a more diverse mainstream culture \u2014 but also , simultaneously , a subculture that is even more alienated and despised , and ever more infuriated and bloody-minded .\nThis is an age in which a woman might succeed a black man as president , but also one in which a member of the white working class has declining options to make a decent living . This is a time when gay people can be married in 50 states , even as working-class families are hanging by a thread . It \u2019 s a period in which we have become far more aware of the historic injustices that still haunt African-Americans and yet we treat the desperate plight of today \u2019 s white working \u00adclass as an afterthought . And so late-stage capitalism is creating a righteous , revolutionary anger that late-stage democracy has precious little ability to moderate or constrain \u2014 and has actually helped exacerbate .\nFor the white working class , having had their morals roundly mocked , their religion deemed primitive , and their economic prospects decimated , now find their very gender and race , indeed the very way they talk about reality , described as a kind of problem for the nation to overcome . This is just one aspect of what Trump has masterfully signaled as \u201c political correctness \u201d run amok , or what might be better described as the newly rigid progressive passion for racial and sexual equality of outcome , rather than the liberal aspiration to mere equality of opportunity .\nMuch of the newly energized left has come to see the white working class not as allies but primarily as bigots , misogynists , racists , and homophobes , thereby condemning those often at the near-bottom rung of the economy to the bottom rung of the culture as well . A struggling white man in the heartland is now told to \u201c check his privilege \u201d by students at Ivy League colleges . Even if you agree that the privilege exists , it \u2019 s hard not to empathize with the object of this disdain . These working-class communities , already alienated , hear \u2014 how can they not ? \u2014 the glib and easy dismissals of \u201c white straight men \u201d as the ultimate source of all our woes . They smell the condescension and the broad generalizations about them \u2014 all of which would be repellent if directed at racial minorities \u2014 and see themselves , in Hoffer \u2019 s words , \u201c disinherited and injured by an unjust order of things . \u201d\nAnd so they wait , and they steam , and they lash out . This was part of the emotional force of the tea party : not just the advancement of racial minorities , gays , and women but the simultaneous demonization of the white working-class world , its culture and way of life . Obama never intended this , but he became a symbol to many of this cultural marginalization . The Black Lives Matter left stoked the fires still further ; so did the gay left , for whom the word magnanimity seems unknown , even in the wake of stunning successes . And as the tea party swept through Washington in 2010 , as its representatives repeatedly held the government budget hostage , threatened the very credit of the U.S. , and refused to hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee , the American political and media Establishment mostly chose to interpret such behavior as something other than unprecedented . But Trump saw what others didn \u2019 t , just as Hoffer noted : \u201c The frustrated individual and the true believer make better prognosticators than those who have reason to want the preservation of the status quo . \u201d\nMass movements , Hoffer argues , are distinguished by a \u201c facility for make-believe \u2026 credulity , a readiness to attempt the impossible. \u201d What , one wonders , could be more impossible than suddenly vetting every single visitor to the U.S. for traces of Islamic belief ? What could be more make-believe than a big , beautiful wall stretching across the entire Mexican border , paid for by the Mexican government ? What could be more credulous than arguing that we could pay off our national debt through a global trade war ? In a conventional political party , and in a rational political discourse , such ideas would be laughed out of contention , their self-evident impossibility disqualifying them from serious consideration . In the emotional fervor of a democratic mass movement , however , these impossibilities become icons of hope , symbols of a new way of conducting politics . Their very impossibility is their appeal .\nBut the most powerful engine for such a movement \u2014 the thing that gets it off the ground , shapes and solidifies and entrenches it \u2014 is always the evocation of hatred . It is , as Hoffer put it , \u201c the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying elements. \u201d And so Trump launched his campaign by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants a population largely of rapists and murderers . He moved on to Muslims , both at home and abroad . He has now added to these enemies \u2014 with sly brilliance \u2014 the Republican Establishment itself . And what makes Trump uniquely dangerous in the history of American politics \u2014 with far broader national appeal than , say , Huey Long or George Wallace \u2014 is his response to all three enemies . It \u2019 s the threat of blunt coercion and dominance .\nAnd so after demonizing most undocumented Mexican immigrants , he then vowed to round up and deport all 11 million of them by force . \u201c They have to go \u201d was the typically blunt phrase he used \u2014 and somehow people didn \u2019 t immediately recognize the monstrous historical echoes . The sheer scale of the police and military operation that this policy would entail boggles the mind . Worse , he emphasized , after the mass murder in San Bernardino , that even the Muslim-Americans you know intimately may turn around and massacre you at any juncture . \u201c There \u2019 s something going on , \u201d he declaimed ominously , giving legitimacy to the most hysterical and ugly of human impulses .\nTo call this fascism doesn \u2019 t do justice to fascism . Fascism had , in some measure , an ideology and occasional coherence that Trump utterly lacks . But his movement is clearly fascistic in its demonization of foreigners , its hyping of a threat by a domestic minority ( Muslims and Mexicans are the new Jews ) , its focus on a single supreme leader of what can only be called a cult , and its deep belief in violence and coercion in a democracy that has heretofore relied on debate and persuasion . This is the Weimar aspect of our current moment . Just as the English Civil War ended with a dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell , and the French Revolution gave us Napoleon Bonaparte , and the unstable chaos of Russian democracy yielded to Vladimir Putin , and the most recent burst of Egyptian democracy set the conditions for General el-Sisi \u2019 s coup , so our paralyzed , emotional hyperdemocracy leads the stumbling , frustrated , angry voter toward the chimerical panacea of Trump .\nHis response to his third vaunted enemy , the RNC , is also laced with the threat of violence . There will be riots in Cleveland if he doesn \u2019 t get his way . The RNC will have \u201c a rough time \u201d if it doesn \u2019 t cooperate . \u201c Paul Ryan , I don \u2019 t know him well , but I \u2019 m sure I \u2019 m going to get along great with him , \u201d Trump has said . \u201c And if I don \u2019 t ? He \u2019 s gon na have to pay a big price , okay ? \u201d The past month has seen delegates to the Cleveland convention receiving death threats ; one of Trump \u2019 s hatchet men , Roger Stone , has already threatened to publish the hotel rooms of delegates who refuse to vote for Trump .\nAnd what \u2019 s notable about Trump \u2019 s supporters is precisely what one would expect from members of a mass movement : their intense loyalty . Trump is their man , however inarticulate they are when explaining why . He \u2019 s tough , he \u2019 s real , and they \u2019 ve got his back , especially when he is attacked by all the people they have come to despise : liberal Democrats and traditional Republicans . At rallies , whenever a protester is hauled out , you can almost sense the rising rage of the collective identity venting itself against a lone dissenter and finding a catharsis of sorts in the brute force a mob can inflict on an individual . Trump tells the crowd he \u2019 d like to punch a protester in the face or have him carried out on a stretcher . No modern politician who has come this close to the presidency has championed violence in this way . It would be disqualifying if our hyper\u00addemocracy hadn \u2019 t already abolished disqualifications .\nAnd while a critical element of 20th-century fascism \u2014 its organized street violence \u2014 is missing , you can begin to see it in embryonic form . The phalanx of bodyguards around Trump grows daily ; plainclothes bouncers in the crowds have emerged as pseudo-cops to contain the incipient unrest his candidacy will only continue to provoke ; supporters have attacked hecklers with sometimes stunning ferocity . Every time Trump legitimizes potential violence by his supporters by saying it comes from a love of country , he sows the seeds for serious civil unrest .\nTrump celebrates torture \u2014 the one true love of tyrants everywhere \u2014 not because it allegedly produces intelligence but because it has a demonstration effect . At his rallies he has recounted the mythical acts of one General John J. Pershing when confronted with an alleged outbreak of Islamist terrorism in the Philippines . Pershing , in Trump \u2019 s telling , lines up 50 Muslim prisoners , swishes a series of bullets in the corpses of freshly slaughtered pigs , and orders his men to put those bullets in their rifles and kill 49 of the captured Muslim men . He spares one captive solely so he can go back and tell his friends . End of the terrorism problem .\nIn some ways , this story contains all the elements of Trump \u2019 s core appeal . The vexing problem of tackling jihadist terror ? Torture and murder enough terrorists and they will simply go away . The complicated issue of undocumented workers , drawn by jobs many Americans won \u2019 t take ? Deport every single one of them and build a wall to stop the rest . Fuck political correctness . As one of his supporters told an obtuse reporter at a rally when asked if he supported Trump : \u201c Hell yeah ! He \u2019 s no-bullshit . All balls . Fuck you all balls . That \u2019 s what I \u2019 m about. \u201d And therein lies the appeal of tyrants from the beginning of time . Fuck you all balls . Irrationality with muscle .\nThe racial aspect of this is also unmissable . When the enemy within is Mexican or Muslim , and your ranks are extremely white , you set up a rubric for a racial conflict . And what \u2019 s truly terrifying about Trump is that he does not seem to shrink from such a prospect ; he relishes it .\nFor , like all tyrants , he is utterly lacking in self-control . Sleeping a handful of hours a night , impulsively tweeting in the early hours , improvising madly on subjects he knows nothing about , Trump rants and raves as he surfs an entirely reactive media landscape . Once again , Plato had his temperament down : A tyrant is a man \u201c not having control of himself [ who ] attempts to rule others \u201d ; a man flooded with fear and love and passion , while having little or no ability to restrain or moderate them ; a \u201c real slave to the greatest fawning , \u201d a man who \u201c throughout his entire life ... is full of fear , overflowing with convulsions and pains. \u201d Sound familiar ? Trump is as mercurial and as unpredictable and as emotional as the daily Twitter stream . And we are contemplating giving him access to the nuclear codes .\nThose who believe that Trump \u2019 s ugly , thuggish populism has no chance of ever making it to the White House seem to me to be missing this dynamic . Neo-fascist movements do not advance gradually by persuasion ; they first transform the terms of the debate , create a new movement based on untrammeled emotion , take over existing institutions , and then ruthlessly exploit events . And so current poll numbers are only reassuring if you ignore the potential impact of sudden , external events \u2014 an economic downturn or a terror attack in a major city in the months before November . I have no doubt , for example , that Trump is sincere in his desire to \u201c cut the head off \u201d ISIS , whatever that can possibly mean . But it remains a fact that the interests of ISIS and the Trump campaign are now perfectly aligned . Fear is always the would-be tyrant \u2019 s greatest ally .\nAnd though Trump \u2019 s unfavorables are extraordinarily high ( around 65 percent ) , he is already showing signs of changing his tune , pivoting ( fitfully ) to the more presidential mode he envisages deploying in the general election . I suspect this will , to some fools on the fence , come as a kind of relief , and may open their minds to him once more . Tyrants , like mob bosses , know the value of a smile : Precisely because of the fear he \u2019 s already generated , you desperately want to believe in his new warmth . It \u2019 s part of the good-cop-bad-cop routine that will be familiar to anyone who has studied the presidency of Vladimir Putin .\nWith his appeal to his own base locked up , Trump may well also shift to more moderate stances on social issues like abortion ( he already wants to amend the GOP platform to a less draconian position ) or gay and even transgender rights . He is consistent in his inconsistency , because , for him , winning is what counts . He has had a real case against Ted Cruz \u2014 that the senator has no base outside ideological-conservative quarters and is even less likely to win a general election . More potently , Trump has a worryingly strong argument against Clinton herself \u2014 or \u201c crooked Hillary , \u201d as he now dubs her .\nHis proposition is a simple one . Remember James Carville \u2019 s core question in the 1992 election : Change versus more of the same ? That sentiment once elected Clinton \u2019 s husband ; it could also elect her opponent this fall . If you like America as it is , vote Clinton . After all , she has been a member of the American political elite for a quarter-century . Clinton , moreover , has shown no ability to inspire or rally anyone but her longtime loyalists . She is lost in the new media and has struggled to put away a 74-year-old socialist who is barely a member of her party . Her own unfavorables are only 11 points lower than Trump \u2019 s ( far higher than Obama \u2019 s , John Kerry \u2019 s , or Al Gore \u2019 s were at this point in the race ) , and the more she campaigns , the higher her unfavorables go ( including in her own party ) . She has a Gore problem . The idea of welcoming her into your living room for the next four years can seem , at times , positively masochistic .\nIt may be that demographics will save us . America is no longer an overwhelmingly white country , and Trump \u2019 s signature issue \u2014 illegal immigration \u2014 is the source of his strength but also of his weakness . Nonetheless , it \u2019 s worth noting how polling models have consistently misread the breadth of his support , especially in these past few weeks ; he will likely bend over backward to include minorities in his fall campaign ; and those convinced he can not bring a whole new swath of white voters back into the political process should remember 2004 , when Karl Rove helped engineer anti-gay-marriage state constitutional amendments that increased conservative voter turnout . All Trump needs is a sliver of minority votes inspired by the new energy of his campaign and the alleged dominance of the Obama coalition could crack ( especially without Obama ) . Throughout the West these past few years , from France to Britain and Germany , the polls have kept missing the power of right-wing insurgency .\nWere Trump to win the White House , the defenses against him would be weak . He would likely bring a GOP majority in the House , and Republicans in the Senate would be subjected to almighty popular fury if they stood in his way . The 4-4 stalemate in the Supreme Court would break in Trump \u2019 s favor . ( In large part , of course , this would be due to the GOP \u2019 s unprecedented decision to hold a vacancy open \u201c for the people to decide , \u201d another massive hyperdemocratic breach in our constitutional defenses . ) And if Trump \u2019 s policies are checked by other branches of government , how might he react ? Just look at his response to the rules of the GOP nomination process . He \u2019 s not interested in rules . And he barely understands the Constitution . In one revealing moment earlier this year , when asked what he would do if the military refused to obey an illegal order to torture a prisoner , Trump simply insisted that the man would obey : \u201c They won \u2019 t refuse . They \u2019 re not going to refuse , believe me. \u201d He later amended his remark , but it speaks volumes about his approach to power . Dick Cheney gave illegal orders to torture prisoners and coerced White House lawyers to cook up absurd \u201c legal \u201d defenses . Trump would make Cheney \u2019 s embrace of the dark side and untrammeled executive power look unambitious .\nIn his 1935 novel , It Can \u2019 t Happen Here , Sinclair Lewis wrote a counterfactual about what would happen if fascism as it was then spreading across Europe were to triumph in America . It \u2019 s not a good novel , but it remains a resonant one . The imagined American fascist leader \u2014 a senator called Buzz Windrip \u2014 is a \u201c Professional Common Man \u2026 But he was the Common Man \u00adtwenty-times-magnified by his oratory , so that while the other Commoners could understand his every purpose , which was exactly the same as their own , they saw him towering among them , and they raised hands to him in worship . \u201d\nHe \u201c was vulgar , almost illiterate , a public liar easily detected , and in his \u2018 ideas \u2019 almost idiotic. \u201d \u201c \u2018 I know the Press only too well , \u2019 \u201d Windrip opines at one point . \u201c \u2018 Almost all editors hide away in spider-dens , men without thought of Family or Public Interest \u2026 plotting how they can put over their lies , and advance their own positions and fill their greedy pocketbooks . \u2019 \u201d\nHe is obsessed with the balance of trade and promises instant economic success : \u201c \u2018 I shall not be content till this country can produce every single thing we need \u2026 We shall have such a balance of trade as will go far to carry out my often-criticized yet completely sound idea of from $ 3000 to $ 5000 per year for every single family. \u2019 \u201d However fantastical and empty his promises , he nonetheless mesmerizes the party faithful at the nominating convention ( held in Cleveland ! ) : \u201c Something in the intensity with which Windrip looked at his audience , looked at all of them , his glance slowly taking them in from the highest-perched seat to the nearest , convinced them that he was talking to each individual , directly and solely ; that he wanted to take each of them into his heart ; that he was telling them the truths , the imperious and dangerous facts , that had been hidden from them . \u201d\nAnd all the elites who stood in his way ? Crippled by their own failures , demoralized by their crumbling stature , they first mock and then cave . As one lone journalist laments before the election ( he finds himself in a concentration camp afterward ) : \u201c I \u2019 ve got to keep remembering \u2026 that Windrip is only the lightest cork on the whirlpool . He didn \u2019 t plot all this thing . With all the justified discontent there is against the smart politicians and the Plush Horses of Plutocracy \u2014 oh , if it hadn \u2019 t been one Windrip , it \u2019 d been another \u2026 We had it coming , we Respectables . \u201d\nAnd , 81 years later , many of us did . An American elite that has presided over massive and increasing public debt , that failed to prevent 9/11 , that chose a disastrous war in the Middle East , that allowed financial markets to nearly destroy the global economy , and that is now so bitterly divided the Congress is effectively moot in a constitutional democracy : \u201c We Respectables \u201d deserve a comeuppance . The vital and valid lesson of the Trump phenomenon is that if the elites can not govern by compromise , someone outside will eventually try to govern by popular passion and brute force .\nBut elites still matter in a democracy . They matter not because they are democracy \u2019 s enemy but because they provide the critical ingredient to save democracy from itself . The political Establishment may be battered and demoralized , deferential to the algorithms of the web and to the monosyllables of a gifted demagogue , but this is not the time to give up on America \u2019 s near-unique and stabilizing blend of democracy and elite responsibility . The country has endured far harsher times than the present without succumbing to rank demagoguery ; it avoided the fascism that destroyed Europe ; it has channeled extraordinary outpourings of democratic energy into constitutional order . It seems shocking to argue that we need elites in this democratic age \u2014 especially with vast inequalities of wealth and elite failures all around us . But we need them precisely to protect this precious democracy from its own destabilizing excesses .\nAnd so those Democrats who are gleefully predicting a Clinton landslide in November need to both check their complacency and understand that the Trump question really isn \u2019 t a cause for partisan Schadenfreude anymore . It \u2019 s much more dangerous than that . Those still backing the demagogue of the left , Bernie Sanders , might want to reflect that their critique of Clinton \u2019 s experience and expertise \u2014 and their facile conflation of that with corruption \u2014 is only playing into Trump \u2019 s hands . That it will fall to Clinton to temper her party \u2019 s ambitions will be uncomfortable to watch , since her willingness to compromise and equivocate is precisely what many Americans find so distrustful . And yet she may soon be all we have left to counter the threat . She needs to grasp the lethality of her foe , moderate the kind of identity politics that unwittingly empowers him , make an unapologetic case that experience and moderation are not vices , address much more directly the anxieties of the white working class\u2014and Democrats must listen .\nMore to the point , those Republicans desperately trying to use the long-standing rules of their own nominating process to thwart this monster deserve our passionate support , not our disdain . This is not the moment to remind them that they partly brought this on themselves . This is a moment to offer solidarity , especially as the odds are increasingly stacked against them . Ted Cruz and John Kasich face their decisive battle in Indiana on May 3 . But they need to fight on , with any tactic at hand , all the way to the bitter end . The Republican delegates who are trying to protect their party from the whims of an outsider demagogue are , at this moment , doing what they ought to be doing to prevent civil and racial unrest , an international conflict , and a constitutional crisis . These GOP elites have every right to deploy whatever rules or procedural roadblocks they can muster , and they should refuse to be intimidated .\nAnd if they fail in Indiana or Cleveland , as they likely will , they need , quite simply , to disown their party \u2019 s candidate . They should resist any temptation to loyally back the nominee or to sit this election out . They must take the fight to Trump at every opportunity , unite with Democrats and Independents against him , and be prepared to sacrifice one election in order to save their party and their country .\nFor Trump is not just a wacky politician of the far right , or a riveting television spectacle , or a Twitter phenom and bizarre working-class hero . He is not just another candidate to be parsed and analyzed by TV pundits in the same breath as all the others . In terms of our liberal democracy and constitutional order , Trump is an extinction-level event . It \u2019 s long past time we started treating him as such .\n* This article appears in the May 2 , 2016 issue of \u2588\u2588\u2588 .",
    "content_original": "Democracies end when they are too democratic. And right now, America is a breeding ground for tyranny.\n\nIllustration by Zohar Lazar\n\nAs this dystopian election campaign has unfolded, my mind keeps being tugged by a passage in Plato\u2019s Republic. It has unsettled \u2014 even surprised \u2014 me from the moment I first read it in graduate school. The passage is from the part of the dialogue where Socrates and his friends are talking about the nature of different political systems, how they change over time, and how one can slowly evolve into another. And Socrates seemed pretty clear on one sobering point: that \u201ctyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy.\u201d What did Plato mean by that? Democracy, for him, I discovered, was a political system of maximal freedom and equality, where every lifestyle is allowed and public offices are filled by a lottery. And the longer a democracy lasted, Plato argued, the more democratic it would become. Its freedoms would multiply; its equality spread. Deference to any sort of authority would wither; tolerance of any kind of inequality would come under intense threat; and multiculturalism and sexual freedom would create a city or a country like \u201ca many-colored cloak decorated in all hues.\u201d\n\nThis rainbow-flag polity, Plato argues, is, for many people, the fairest of regimes. The freedom in that democracy has to be experienced to be believed \u2014 with shame and privilege in particular emerging over time as anathema. But it is inherently unstable. As the authority of elites fades, as Establishment values cede to popular ones, views and identities can become so magnificently diverse as to be mutually uncomprehending. And when all the barriers to equality, formal and informal, have been removed; when everyone is equal; when elites are despised and full license is established to do \u201cwhatever one wants,\u201d you arrive at what might be called late-stage democracy. There is no kowtowing to authority here, let alone to political experience or expertise.\n\nThe very rich come under attack, as inequality becomes increasingly intolerable. Patriarchy is also dismantled: \u201cWe almost forgot to mention the extent of the law of equality and of freedom in the relations of women with men and men with women.\u201d Family hierarchies are inverted: \u201cA father habituates himself to be like his child and fear his sons, and a son habituates himself to be like his father and to have no shame before or fear of his parents.\u201d In classrooms, \u201cas the teacher ... is frightened of the pupils and fawns on them, so the students make light of their teachers.\u201d Animals are regarded as equal to humans; the rich mingle freely with the poor in the streets and try to blend in. The foreigner is equal to the citizen.\n\nAnd it is when a democracy has ripened as fully as this, Plato argues, that a would-be tyrant will often seize his moment.\n\nHe is usually of the elite but has a nature in tune with the time \u2014 given over to random pleasures and whims, feasting on plenty of food and sex, and reveling in the nonjudgment that is democracy\u2019s civil religion. He makes his move by \u201ctaking over a particularly obedient mob\u201d and attacking his wealthy peers as corrupt. If not stopped quickly, his appetite for attacking the rich on behalf of the people swells further. He is a traitor to his class \u2014 and soon, his elite enemies, shorn of popular legitimacy, find a way to appease him or are forced to flee. Eventually, he stands alone, promising to cut through the paralysis of democratic incoherence. It\u2019s as if he were offering the addled, distracted, and self-indulgent citizens a kind of relief from democracy\u2019s endless choices and insecurities. He rides a backlash to excess\u2014\u201ctoo much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery\u201d \u2014 and offers himself as the personified answer to the internal conflicts of the democratic mess. He pledges, above all, to take on the increasingly despised elites. And as the people thrill to him as a kind of solution, a democracy willingly, even impetuously, repeals itself.\n\nAnd so, as I chitchatted over cocktails at a Washington office Christmas party in December, and saw, looming above our heads, the pulsating, angry televised face of Donald Trump on Fox News, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little nausea permeate my stomach. And as I watched frenzied Trump rallies on C-SPAN in the spring, and saw him lay waste to far more qualified political peers in the debates by simply calling them names, the nausea turned to dread. And when he seemed to condone physical violence as a response to political disagreement, alarm bells started to ring in my head. Plato had planted a gnawing worry in my mind a few decades ago about the intrinsic danger of late-democratic life. It was increasingly hard not to see in Plato\u2019s vision a murky reflection of our own hyperdemocratic times and in Trump a demagogic, tyrannical character plucked directly out of one of the first books about politics ever written.\n\nCould it be that the Donald has emerged from the populist circuses of pro wrestling and New York City tabloids, via reality television and Twitter, to prove not just Plato but also James Madison right, that democracies \u201chave ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention \u2026 and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths\u201d? Is he testing democracy\u2019s singular weakness \u2014 its susceptibility to the demagogue \u2014 by blasting through the firewalls we once had in place to prevent such a person from seizing power? Or am I overreacting?\n\nPerhaps. The nausea comes and goes, and there have been days when the news algorithm has actually reassured me that \u201cpeak Trump\u201d has arrived. But it hasn\u2019t gone away, and neither has Trump. In the wake of his most recent primary triumphs, at a time when he is perilously close to winning enough delegates to grab the Republican nomination outright, I think we must confront this dread and be clear about what this election has already revealed about the fragility of our way of life and the threat late-stage democracy is beginning to pose to itself.\n\nPlato, of course, was not clairvoyant. His analysis of how democracy can turn into tyranny is a complex one more keyed toward ancient societies than our own (and contains more wrinkles and eddies than I can summarize here). His disdain for democratic life was fueled in no small part by the fact that a democracy had executed his mentor, Socrates. And he would, I think, have been astonished at how American democracy has been able to thrive with unprecedented stability over the last couple of centuries even as it has brought more and more people into its embrace. It remains, in my view, a miracle of constitutional craftsmanship and cultural resilience. There is no place I would rather live. But it is not immortal, nor should we assume it is immune to the forces that have endangered democracy so many times in human history.\n\nPart of American democracy\u2019s stability is owed to the fact that the Founding Fathers had read their Plato. To guard our democracy from the tyranny of the majority and the passions of the mob, they constructed large, hefty barriers between the popular will and the exercise of power. Voting rights were tightly circumscribed. The president and vice-president were not to be popularly elected but selected by an Electoral College, whose representatives were selected by the various states, often through state legislatures. The Senate\u2019s structure (with two members from every state) was designed to temper the power of the more populous states, and its term of office (six years, compared with two for the House) was designed to cool and restrain temporary populist passions. The Supreme Court, picked by the president and confirmed by the Senate, was the final bulwark against any democratic furies that might percolate up from the House and threaten the Constitution. This separation of powers was designed precisely to create sturdy firewalls against democratic wildfires.\n\nOver the centuries, however, many of these undemocratic rules have been weakened or abolished. The franchise has been extended far beyond propertied white men. The presidency is now effectively elected through popular vote, with the Electoral College almost always reflecting the national democratic will. And these formal democratic advances were accompanied by informal ones, as the culture of democracy slowly took deeper root. For a very long time, only the elites of the political parties came to select their candidates at their quadrennial conventions, with the vote largely restricted to party officials from the various states (and often decided in, yes, smoke-filled rooms in large hotel suites). Beginning in the early 1900s, however, the parties began experimenting with primaries, and after the chaos of the 1968 Democratic convention, today\u2019s far more democratic system became the norm.\n\nDirect democracy didn\u2019t just elect Congress and the president anymore; it expanded the notion of who might be qualified for public office. Once, candidates built a career through experience in elected or Cabinet positions or as military commanders; they were effectively selected by peer review. That elitist sorting mechanism has slowly imploded. In 1940, Wendell Willkie, a businessman with no previous political office, won the Republican nomination for president, pledging to keep America out of war and boasting that his personal wealth inoculated him against corruption: \u201cI will be under obligation to nobody except the people.\u201d He lost badly to Franklin D. Roosevelt, but nonetheless, since then, nonpolitical candidates have proliferated, from Ross Perot and Jesse Jackson, to Steve Forbes and Herman Cain, to this year\u2019s crop of Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and, of course, Donald J. Trump. This further widening of our democracy \u2014 our increased openness to being led by anyone; indeed, our accelerating preference for outsiders \u2014 is now almost complete.\n\nThe barriers to the popular will, especially when it comes to choosing our president, are now almost nonexistent. In 2000, George W. Bush lost the popular vote and won the election thanks to Electoral College math and, more egregiously, to a partisan Supreme Court vote. Al Gore\u2019s eventual concession spared the nation a constitutional crisis, but the episode generated widespread unease, not just among Democrats. And this year, the delegate system established by our political parties is also under assault. Trump has argued that the candidate with the most votes should get the Republican nomination, regardless of the rules in place. It now looks as if he won\u2019t even need to win that argument \u2014 that he\u2019ll bank enough delegates to secure the nomination uncontested \u2014 but he\u2019s won it anyway. Fully half of Americans now believe the traditional nominating system is rigged.\n\nMany contend, of course, that American democracy is actually in retreat, close to being destroyed by the vastly more unequal economy of the last quarter-century and the ability of the very rich to purchase political influence. This is Bernie Sanders\u2019s core critique. But the past few presidential elections have demonstrated that, in fact, money from the ultrarich has been mostly a dud. Barack Obama, whose 2008 campaign was propelled by small donors and empowered by the internet, blazed the trail of the modern-day insurrectionist, defeating the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and later his Republican opponent (both pillars of their parties\u2019 Establishments and backed by moneyed elites). In 2012, the fund-raising power behind Mitt Romney \u2014 avatar of the one percent \u2014 failed to dislodge Obama from office. And in this presidential cycle, the breakout candidates of both parties have soared without financial support from the elites. Sanders, who is sustaining his campaign all the way to California on the backs of small donors and large crowds, is, to put it bluntly, a walking refutation of his own argument. Trump, of course, is a largely self-funding billionaire \u2014 but like Willkie, he argues that his wealth uniquely enables him to resist the influence of the rich and their lobbyists. Those despairing over the influence of Big Money in American politics must also explain the swift, humiliating demise of Jeb Bush and the struggling Establishment campaign of Hillary Clinton. The evidence suggests that direct democracy, far from being throttled, is actually intensifying its grip on American politics.\n\nNone of this is necessarily cause for alarm, even though it would be giving the Founding Fathers palpitations. The emergence of the first black president \u2014 unimaginable before our more inclusive democracy \u2014 is miraculous, a strengthening, rather than weakening, of the system. The days when party machines just fixed things or rigged elections are mercifully done with. The way in which outsider candidates, from Obama to Trump and Sanders, have brought millions of new people into the electoral process is an unmitigated advance. The inclusion of previously excluded voices helps, rather than impedes, our public deliberation. But it is precisely because of the great accomplishments of our democracy that we should be vigilant about its specific, unique vulnerability: its susceptibility, in stressful times, to the appeal of a shameless demagogue.\n\nWhat the 21st century added to this picture, it\u2019s now blindingly obvious, was media democracy \u2014 in a truly revolutionary form. If late-stage political democracy has taken two centuries to ripen, the media equivalent took around two decades, swiftly erasing almost any elite moderation or control of our democratic discourse. The process had its origins in partisan talk radio at the end of the past century. The rise of the internet \u2014 an event so swift and pervasive its political effect is only now beginning to be understood \u2014 further democratized every source of information, dramatically expanded each outlet\u2019s readership, and gave everyone a platform. All the old barriers to entry \u2014 the cost of print and paper and distribution \u2014 crumbled.\n\nSo much of this was welcome. I relished it myself in the early aughts, starting a blog and soon reaching as many readers, if not more, as some small magazines do. Fusty old-media institutions, grown fat and lazy, deserved a drubbing. The early independent blogosphere corrected facts, exposed bias, earned scoops. And as the medium matured, and as Facebook and Twitter took hold, everyone became a kind of blogger. In ways no 20th-century journalist would have believed, we all now have our own virtual newspapers on our Facebook newsfeeds and Twitter timelines \u2014 picking stories from countless sources and creating a peer-to-peer media almost completely free of editing or interference by elites. This was bound to make politics more fluid. Political organizing \u2014 calling a meeting, fomenting a rally to advance a cause \u2014 used to be extremely laborious. Now you could bring together a virtual mass movement with a single webpage. It would take you a few seconds.\n\nThe web was also uniquely capable of absorbing other forms of media, conflating genres and categories in ways never seen before. The distinction between politics and entertainment became fuzzier; election coverage became even more modeled on sportscasting; your Pornhub jostled right next to your mother\u2019s Facebook page. The web\u2019s algorithms all but removed any editorial judgment, and the effect soon had cable news abandoning even the pretense of asking \u201cIs this relevant?\u201d or \u201cDo we really need to cover this live?\u201d in the rush toward ratings bonanzas. In the end, all these categories were reduced to one thing: traffic, measured far more accurately than any other medium had ever done before.\n\nAnd what mainly fuels this is precisely what the Founders feared about democratic culture: feeling, emotion, and narcissism, rather than reason, empiricism, and public-spiritedness. Online debates become personal, emotional, and irresolvable almost as soon as they begin. Godwin\u2019s Law \u2014 it\u2019s only a matter of time before a comments section brings up Hitler \u2014 is a reflection of the collapse of the reasoned deliberation the Founders saw as indispensable to a functioning republic.\n\nYes, occasional rational points still fly back and forth, but there are dramatically fewer elite arbiters to establish which of those points is actually true or valid or relevant. We have lost authoritative sources for even a common set of facts. And without such common empirical ground, the emotional component of politics becomes inflamed and reason retreats even further. The more emotive the candidate, the more supporters he or she will get.\n\nPolitically, we lucked out at first. Obama would never have been nominated for the presidency, let alone elected, if he hadn\u2019t harnessed the power of the web and the charisma of his media celebrity. But he was also, paradoxically, a very elite figure, a former state and U.S. senator, a product of Harvard Law School, and, as it turned out, blessed with a preternaturally rational and calm disposition. So he has masked, temporarily, the real risks in the system that his pioneering campaign revealed. Hence many Democrats\u2019 frustration with him. Those who saw in his campaign the seeds of revolutionary change, who were drawn to him by their own messianic delusions, came to be bitterly disappointed by his governing moderation and pragmatism.\n\nThe climate Obama thrived in, however, was also ripe for far less restrained opportunists. In 2008, Sarah Palin emerged as proof that an ardent Republican, branded as an outsider, tailor-made for reality TV, proud of her own ignorance about the world, and reaching an audience directly through online media, could also triumph in this new era. She was, it turned out, a John the Baptist for the true messiah of conservative populism, waiting patiently and strategically for his time to come.\n\nTrump, we now know, had been considering running for president for decades. Those who didn\u2019t see him coming \u2014 or kept treating him as a joke \u2014 had not yet absorbed the precedents of Obama and Palin or the power of the new wide-open system to change the rules of the political game. Trump was as underrated for all of 2015 as Obama was in 2007 \u2014 and for the same reasons. He intuitively grasped the vanishing authority of American political and media elites, and he had long fashioned a public persona perfectly attuned to blast past them.\n\nDespite his immense wealth and inherited privilege, Trump had always cultivated a common touch. He did not hide his wealth in the late-20th century \u2014 he flaunted it in a way that connected with the masses. He lived the rich man\u2019s life most working men dreamed of \u2014 endless glamour and women, for example \u2014 without sacrificing a way of talking about the world that would not be out of place on the construction sites he regularly toured. His was a cult of democratic aspiration. His 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, promised its readers a path to instant success; his appearances on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d cemented his appeal. His friendship with Vince McMahon offered him an early entr\u00e9e into the world of professional wrestling, with its fusion of sports and fantasy. He was a macho media superstar.\n\nOne of the more amazing episodes in Sarah Palin\u2019s early political life, in fact, bears this out. She popped up in the Anchorage Daily News as \u201ca commercial fisherman from Wasilla\u201d on April 3, 1996. Palin had told her husband she was going to Costco but had sneaked into J.C. Penney in Anchorage to see \u2026 one Ivana Trump, who, in the wake of her divorce, was touting her branded perfume. \u201cWe want to see Ivana,\u201d Palin told the paper, \u201cbecause we are so desperate in Alaska for any semblance of glamour and culture.\u201d\n\nTrump assiduously cultivated this image and took to reality television as a natural. Each week, for 14 seasons of The Apprentice, he would look someone in the eye and tell them, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d The conversation most humane bosses fear to have with an employee was something Trump clearly relished, and the cruelty became entertainment. In retrospect, it is clear he was training \u2014 both himself and his viewers. If you want to understand why a figure so widely disliked nonetheless powers toward the election as if he were approaching a reality-TV-show finale, look no further. His television tactics, as applied to presidential debates, wiped out rivals used to a different game. And all our reality-TV training has conditioned us to hope he\u2019ll win \u2014 or at least stay in the game till the final round. In such a shame-free media environment, the assholes often win. In the end, you support them because they\u2019re assholes.\n\nIn Eric Hoffer\u2019s classic 1951 tract, The True Believer, he sketches the dynamics of a genuine mass movement. He was thinking of the upheavals in Europe in the first half of the century, but the book remains sobering, especially now. Hoffer\u2019s core insight was to locate the source of all truly mass movements in a collective sense of acute frustration. Not despair, or revolt, or resignation \u2014 but frustration simmering with rage. Mass movements, he notes (as did Tocqueville centuries before him), rarely arise when oppression or misery is at its worst (say, 2009); they tend to appear when the worst is behind us but the future seems not so much better (say, 2016). It is when a recovery finally gathers speed and some improvement is tangible but not yet widespread that the anger begins to rise. After the suffering of recession or unemployment, and despite hard work with stagnant or dwindling pay, the future stretches ahead with relief just out of reach. When those who helped create the last recession face no consequences but renewed fabulous wealth, the anger reaches a crescendo.\n\nThe deeper, long-term reasons for today\u2019s rage are not hard to find, although many of us elites have shamefully found ourselves able to ignore them. The jobs available to the working class no longer contain the kind of craftsmanship or satisfaction or meaning that can take the sting out of their low and stagnant wages. The once-familiar avenues for socialization \u2014 the church, the union hall, the VFW \u2014 have become less vibrant and social isolation more common. Global economic forces have pummeled blue-collar workers more relentlessly than almost any other segment of society, forcing them to compete against hundreds of millions of equally skilled workers throughout the planet. No one asked them in the 1990s if this was the future they wanted. And the impact has been more brutal than many economists predicted. No wonder suicide and mortality rates among the white working poor are spiking dramatically.\n\n\u201cIt is usually those whose poverty is relatively recent, the \u2018new poor,\u2019 who throb with the ferment of frustration,\u201d Hoffer argues. Fundamentalist religion long provided some emotional support for those left behind (for one thing, it invites practitioners to defy the elites as unholy), but its influence has waned as modernity has penetrated almost everything and the great culture wars of the 1990s and 2000s have ended in a rout. The result has been a more diverse mainstream culture \u2014 but also, simultaneously, a subculture that is even more alienated and despised, and ever more infuriated and bloody-minded.\n\nThis is an age in which a woman might succeed a black man as president, but also one in which a member of the white working class has declining options to make a decent living. This is a time when gay people can be married in 50 states, even as working-class families are hanging by a thread. It\u2019s a period in which we have become far more aware of the historic injustices that still haunt African-Americans and yet we treat the desperate plight of today\u2019s white working \u00adclass as an afterthought. And so late-stage capitalism is creating a righteous, revolutionary anger that late-stage democracy has precious little ability to moderate or constrain \u2014 and has actually helped exacerbate.\n\nFor the white working class, having had their morals roundly mocked, their religion deemed primitive, and their economic prospects decimated, now find their very gender and race, indeed the very way they talk about reality, described as a kind of problem for the nation to overcome. This is just one aspect of what Trump has masterfully signaled as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d run amok, or what might be better described as the newly rigid progressive passion for racial and sexual equality of outcome, rather than the liberal aspiration to mere equality of opportunity.\n\nMuch of the newly energized left has come to see the white working class not as allies but primarily as bigots, misogynists, racists, and homophobes, thereby condemning those often at the near-bottom rung of the economy to the bottom rung of the culture as well. A struggling white man in the heartland is now told to \u201ccheck his privilege\u201d by students at Ivy League colleges. Even if you agree that the privilege exists, it\u2019s hard not to empathize with the object of this disdain. These working-class communities, already alienated, hear \u2014 how can they not? \u2014 the glib and easy dismissals of \u201cwhite straight men\u201d as the ultimate source of all our woes. They smell the condescension and the broad generalizations about them \u2014 all of which would be repellent if directed at racial minorities \u2014 and see themselves, in Hoffer\u2019s words, \u201cdisinherited and injured by an unjust order of things.\u201d\n\nAnd so they wait, and they steam, and they lash out. This was part of the emotional force of the tea party: not just the advancement of racial minorities, gays, and women but the simultaneous demonization of the white working-class world, its culture and way of life. Obama never intended this, but he became a symbol to many of this cultural marginalization. The Black Lives Matter left stoked the fires still further; so did the gay left, for whom the word magnanimity seems unknown, even in the wake of stunning successes. And as the tea party swept through Washington in 2010, as its representatives repeatedly held the government budget hostage, threatened the very credit of the U.S., and refused to hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, the American political and media Establishment mostly chose to interpret such behavior as something other than unprecedented. But Trump saw what others didn\u2019t, just as Hoffer noted: \u201cThe frustrated individual and the true believer make better prognosticators than those who have reason to want the preservation of the status quo.\u201d\n\nMass movements, Hoffer argues, are distinguished by a \u201cfacility for make-believe \u2026 credulity, a readiness to attempt the impossible.\u201d What, one wonders, could be more impossible than suddenly vetting every single visitor to the U.S. for traces of Islamic belief? What could be more make-believe than a big, beautiful wall stretching across the entire Mexican border, paid for by the Mexican government? What could be more credulous than arguing that we could pay off our national debt through a global trade war? In a conventional political party, and in a rational political discourse, such ideas would be laughed out of contention, their self-evident impossibility disqualifying them from serious consideration. In the emotional fervor of a democratic mass movement, however, these impossibilities become icons of hope, symbols of a new way of conducting politics. Their very impossibility is their appeal.\n\nBut the most powerful engine for such a movement \u2014 the thing that gets it off the ground, shapes and solidifies and entrenches it \u2014 is always the evocation of hatred. It is, as Hoffer put it, \u201cthe most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying elements.\u201d And so Trump launched his campaign by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants a population largely of rapists and murderers. He moved on to Muslims, both at home and abroad. He has now added to these enemies \u2014 with sly brilliance \u2014 the Republican Establishment itself. And what makes Trump uniquely dangerous in the history of American politics \u2014 with far broader national appeal than, say, Huey Long or George Wallace \u2014 is his response to all three enemies. It\u2019s the threat of blunt coercion and dominance.\n\nAnd so after demonizing most undocumented Mexican immigrants, he then vowed to round up and deport all 11 million of them by force. \u201cThey have to go\u201d was the typically blunt phrase he used \u2014 and somehow people didn\u2019t immediately recognize the monstrous historical echoes. The sheer scale of the police and military operation that this policy would entail boggles the mind. Worse, he emphasized, after the mass murder in San Bernardino, that even the Muslim-Americans you know intimately may turn around and massacre you at any juncture. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d he declaimed ominously, giving legitimacy to the most hysterical and ugly of human impulses.\n\nTo call this fascism doesn\u2019t do justice to fascism. Fascism had, in some measure, an ideology and occasional coherence that Trump utterly lacks. But his movement is clearly fascistic in its demonization of foreigners, its hyping of a threat by a domestic minority (Muslims and Mexicans are the new Jews), its focus on a single supreme leader of what can only be called a cult, and its deep belief in violence and coercion in a democracy that has heretofore relied on debate and persuasion. This is the Weimar aspect of our current moment. Just as the English Civil War ended with a dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell, and the French Revolution gave us Napoleon Bonaparte, and the unstable chaos of Russian democracy yielded to Vladimir Putin, and the most recent burst of Egyptian democracy set the conditions for General el-Sisi\u2019s coup, so our paralyzed, emotional hyperdemocracy leads the stumbling, frustrated, angry voter toward the chimerical panacea of Trump.\n\nHis response to his third vaunted enemy, the RNC, is also laced with the threat of violence. There will be riots in Cleveland if he doesn\u2019t get his way. The RNC will have \u201ca rough time\u201d if it doesn\u2019t cooperate. \u201cPaul Ryan, I don\u2019t know him well, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get along great with him,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t? He\u2019s gonna have to pay a big price, okay?\u201d The past month has seen delegates to the Cleveland convention receiving death threats; one of Trump\u2019s hatchet men, Roger Stone, has already threatened to publish the hotel rooms of delegates who refuse to vote for Trump.\n\nAnd what\u2019s notable about Trump\u2019s supporters is precisely what one would expect from members of a mass movement: their intense loyalty. Trump is their man, however inarticulate they are when explaining why. He\u2019s tough, he\u2019s real, and they\u2019ve got his back, especially when he is attacked by all the people they have come to despise: liberal Democrats and traditional Republicans. At rallies, whenever a protester is hauled out, you can almost sense the rising rage of the collective identity venting itself against a lone dissenter and finding a catharsis of sorts in the brute force a mob can inflict on an individual. Trump tells the crowd he\u2019d like to punch a protester in the face or have him carried out on a stretcher. No modern politician who has come this close to the presidency has championed violence in this way. It would be disqualifying if our hyper\u00addemocracy hadn\u2019t already abolished disqualifications.\n\nAnd while a critical element of 20th-century fascism \u2014 its organized street violence \u2014 is missing, you can begin to see it in embryonic form. The phalanx of bodyguards around Trump grows daily; plainclothes bouncers in the crowds have emerged as pseudo-cops to contain the incipient unrest his candidacy will only continue to provoke; supporters have attacked hecklers with sometimes stunning ferocity. Every time Trump legitimizes potential violence by his supporters by saying it comes from a love of country, he sows the seeds for serious civil unrest.\n\nTrump celebrates torture \u2014 the one true love of tyrants everywhere \u2014 not because it allegedly produces intelligence but because it has a demonstration effect. At his rallies he has recounted the mythical acts of one General John J. Pershing when confronted with an alleged outbreak of Islamist terrorism in the Philippines. Pershing, in Trump\u2019s telling, lines up 50 Muslim prisoners, swishes a series of bullets in the corpses of freshly slaughtered pigs, and orders his men to put those bullets in their rifles and kill 49 of the captured Muslim men. He spares one captive solely so he can go back and tell his friends. End of the terrorism problem.\n\nIn some ways, this story contains all the elements of Trump\u2019s core appeal. The vexing problem of tackling jihadist terror? Torture and murder enough terrorists and they will simply go away. The complicated issue of undocumented workers, drawn by jobs many Americans won\u2019t take? Deport every single one of them and build a wall to stop the rest. Fuck political correctness. As one of his supporters told an obtuse reporter at a rally when asked if he supported Trump: \u201cHell yeah! He\u2019s no-bullshit. All balls. Fuck you all balls. That\u2019s what I\u2019m about.\u201d And therein lies the appeal of tyrants from the beginning of time. Fuck you all balls. Irrationality with muscle.\n\nThe racial aspect of this is also unmissable. When the enemy within is Mexican or Muslim, and your ranks are extremely white, you set up a rubric for a racial conflict. And what\u2019s truly terrifying about Trump is that he does not seem to shrink from such a prospect; he relishes it.\n\nFor, like all tyrants, he is utterly lacking in self-control. Sleeping a handful of hours a night, impulsively tweeting in the early hours, improvising madly on subjects he knows nothing about, Trump rants and raves as he surfs an entirely reactive media landscape. Once again, Plato had his temperament down: A tyrant is a man \u201cnot having control of himself [who] attempts to rule others\u201d; a man flooded with fear and love and passion, while having little or no ability to restrain or moderate them; a \u201creal slave to the greatest fawning,\u201d a man who \u201cthroughout his entire life ... is full of fear, overflowing with convulsions and pains.\u201d Sound familiar? Trump is as mercurial and as unpredictable and as emotional as the daily Twitter stream. And we are contemplating giving him access to the nuclear codes.\n\nThose who believe that Trump\u2019s ugly, thuggish populism has no chance of ever making it to the White House seem to me to be missing this dynamic. Neo-fascist movements do not advance gradually by persuasion; they first transform the terms of the debate, create a new movement based on untrammeled emotion, take over existing institutions, and then ruthlessly exploit events. And so current poll numbers are only reassuring if you ignore the potential impact of sudden, external events \u2014 an economic downturn or a terror attack in a major city in the months before November. I have no doubt, for example, that Trump is sincere in his desire to \u201ccut the head off\u201d ISIS, whatever that can possibly mean. But it remains a fact that the interests of ISIS and the Trump campaign are now perfectly aligned. Fear is always the would-be tyrant\u2019s greatest ally.\n\nAnd though Trump\u2019s unfavorables are extraordinarily high (around 65 percent), he is already showing signs of changing his tune, pivoting (fitfully) to the more presidential mode he envisages deploying in the general election. I suspect this will, to some fools on the fence, come as a kind of relief, and may open their minds to him once more. Tyrants, like mob bosses, know the value of a smile: Precisely because of the fear he\u2019s already generated, you desperately want to believe in his new warmth. It\u2019s part of the good-cop-bad-cop routine that will be familiar to anyone who has studied the presidency of Vladimir Putin.\n\nWith his appeal to his own base locked up, Trump may well also shift to more moderate stances on social issues like abortion (he already wants to amend the GOP platform to a less draconian position) or gay and even transgender rights. He is consistent in his inconsistency, because, for him, winning is what counts. He has had a real case against Ted Cruz \u2014 that the senator has no base outside ideological-conservative quarters and is even less likely to win a general election. More potently, Trump has a worryingly strong argument against Clinton herself \u2014 or \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d as he now dubs her.\n\nHis proposition is a simple one. Remember James Carville\u2019s core question in the 1992 election: Change versus more of the same? That sentiment once elected Clinton\u2019s husband; it could also elect her opponent this fall. If you like America as it is, vote Clinton. After all, she has been a member of the American political elite for a quarter-century. Clinton, moreover, has shown no ability to inspire or rally anyone but her longtime loyalists. She is lost in the new media and has struggled to put away a 74-year-old socialist who is barely a member of her party. Her own unfavorables are only 11 points lower than Trump\u2019s (far higher than Obama\u2019s, John Kerry\u2019s, or Al Gore\u2019s were at this point in the race), and the more she campaigns, the higher her unfavorables go (including in her own party). She has a Gore problem. The idea of welcoming her into your living room for the next four years can seem, at times, positively masochistic.\n\nIt may be that demographics will save us. America is no longer an overwhelmingly white country, and Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 illegal immigration \u2014 is the source of his strength but also of his weakness. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting how polling models have consistently misread the breadth of his support, especially in these past few weeks; he will likely bend over backward to include minorities in his fall campaign; and those convinced he cannot bring a whole new swath of white voters back into the political process should remember 2004, when Karl Rove helped engineer anti-gay-marriage state constitutional amendments that increased conservative voter turnout. All Trump needs is a sliver of minority votes inspired by the new energy of his campaign and the alleged dominance of the Obama coalition could crack (especially without Obama). Throughout the West these past few years, from France to Britain and Germany, the polls have kept missing the power of right-wing insurgency.\n\nWere Trump to win the White House, the defenses against him would be weak. He would likely bring a GOP majority in the House, and Republicans in the Senate would be subjected to almighty popular fury if they stood in his way. The 4-4 stalemate in the Supreme Court would break in Trump\u2019s favor. (In large part, of course, this would be due to the GOP\u2019s unprecedented decision to hold a vacancy open \u201cfor the people to decide,\u201d another massive hyperdemocratic breach in our constitutional defenses.) And if Trump\u2019s policies are checked by other branches of government, how might he react? Just look at his response to the rules of the GOP nomination process. He\u2019s not interested in rules. And he barely understands the Constitution. In one revealing moment earlier this year, when asked what he would do if the military refused to obey an illegal order to torture a prisoner, Trump simply insisted that the man would obey: \u201cThey won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse, believe me.\u201d He later amended his remark, but it speaks volumes about his approach to power. Dick Cheney gave illegal orders to torture prisoners and coerced White House lawyers to cook up absurd \u201clegal\u201d defenses. Trump would make Cheney\u2019s embrace of the dark side and untrammeled executive power look unambitious.\n\nIn his 1935 novel, It Can\u2019t Happen Here, Sinclair Lewis wrote a counterfactual about what would happen if fascism as it was then spreading across Europe were to triumph in America. It\u2019s not a good novel, but it remains a resonant one. The imagined American fascist leader \u2014 a senator called Buzz Windrip \u2014 is a \u201cProfessional Common Man \u2026 But he was the Common Man \u00adtwenty-times-magnified by his oratory, so that while the other Commoners could understand his every purpose, which was exactly the same as their own, they saw him towering among them, and they raised hands to him in worship.\u201d\n\nHe \u201cwas vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \u2018ideas\u2019 almost idiotic.\u201d \u201c \u2018I know the Press only too well,\u2019 \u201d Windrip opines at one point. \u201c \u2018Almost all editors hide away in spider-dens, men without thought of Family or Public Interest \u2026 plotting how they can put over their lies, and advance their own positions and fill their greedy pocketbooks.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe is obsessed with the balance of trade and promises instant economic success: \u201c \u2018I shall not be content till this country can produce every single thing we need \u2026 We shall have such a balance of trade as will go far to carry out my often-criticized yet completely sound idea of from $3000 to $5000 per year for every single family.\u2019 \u201d However fantastical and empty his promises, he nonetheless mesmerizes the party faithful at the nominating convention (held in Cleveland!): \u201cSomething in the intensity with which Windrip looked at his audience, looked at all of them, his glance slowly taking them in from the highest-perched seat to the nearest, convinced them that he was talking to each individual, directly and solely; that he wanted to take each of them into his heart; that he was telling them the truths, the imperious and dangerous facts, that had been hidden from them.\u201d\n\nAnd all the elites who stood in his way? Crippled by their own failures, demoralized by their crumbling stature, they first mock and then cave. As one lone journalist laments before the election (he finds himself in a concentration camp afterward): \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep remembering \u2026 that Windrip is only the lightest cork on the whirlpool. He didn\u2019t plot all this thing. With all the justified discontent there is against the smart politicians and the Plush Horses of Plutocracy \u2014 oh, if it hadn\u2019t been one Windrip, it\u2019d been another \u2026 We had it coming, we Respectables.\u201d\n\nAnd, 81 years later, many of us did. An American elite that has presided over massive and increasing public debt, that failed to prevent 9/11, that chose a disastrous war in the Middle East, that allowed financial markets to nearly destroy the global economy, and that is now so bitterly divided the Congress is effectively moot in a constitutional democracy: \u201cWe Respectables\u201d deserve a comeuppance. The vital and valid lesson of the Trump phenomenon is that if the elites cannot govern by compromise, someone outside will eventually try to govern by popular passion and brute force.\n\nBut elites still matter in a democracy. They matter not because they are democracy\u2019s enemy but because they provide the critical ingredient to save democracy from itself. The political Establishment may be battered and demoralized, deferential to the algorithms of the web and to the monosyllables of a gifted demagogue, but this is not the time to give up on America\u2019s near-unique and stabilizing blend of democracy and elite responsibility. The country has endured far harsher times than the present without succumbing to rank demagoguery; it avoided the fascism that destroyed Europe; it has channeled extraordinary outpourings of democratic energy into constitutional order. It seems shocking to argue that we need elites in this democratic age \u2014 especially with vast inequalities of wealth and elite failures all around us. But we need them precisely to protect this precious democracy from its own destabilizing excesses.\n\nAnd so those Democrats who are gleefully predicting a Clinton landslide in November need to both check their complacency and understand that the Trump question really isn\u2019t a cause for partisan Schadenfreude anymore. It\u2019s much more dangerous than that. Those still backing the demagogue of the left, Bernie Sanders, might want to reflect that their critique of Clinton\u2019s experience and expertise \u2014 and their facile conflation of that with corruption \u2014 is only playing into Trump\u2019s hands. That it will fall to Clinton to temper her party\u2019s ambitions will be uncomfortable to watch, since her willingness to compromise and equivocate is precisely what many Americans find so distrustful. And yet she may soon be all we have left to counter the threat. She needs to grasp the lethality of her foe, moderate the kind of identity politics that unwittingly empowers him, make an unapologetic case that experience and moderation are not vices, address much more directly the anxieties of the white working class\u2014and Democrats must listen.\n\nMore to the point, those Republicans desperately trying to use the long-standing rules of their own nominating process to thwart this monster deserve our passionate support, not our disdain. This is not the moment to remind them that they partly brought this on themselves. This is a moment to offer solidarity, especially as the odds are increasingly stacked against them. Ted Cruz and John Kasich face their decisive battle in Indiana on May 3. But they need to fight on, with any tactic at hand, all the way to the bitter end. The Republican delegates who are trying to protect their party from the whims of an outsider demagogue are, at this moment, doing what they ought to be doing to prevent civil and racial unrest, an international conflict, and a constitutional crisis. These GOP elites have every right to deploy whatever rules or procedural roadblocks they can muster, and they should refuse to be intimidated.\n\nAnd if they fail in Indiana or Cleveland, as they likely will, they need, quite simply, to disown their party\u2019s candidate. They should resist any temptation to loyally back the nominee or to sit this election out. They must take the fight to Trump at every opportunity, unite with Democrats and Independents against him, and be prepared to sacrifice one election in order to save their party and their country.\n\nFor Trump is not just a wacky politician of the far right, or a riveting television spectacle, or a Twitter phenom and bizarre working-class hero. He is not just another candidate to be parsed and analyzed by TV pundits in the same breath as all the others. In terms of our liberal democracy and constitutional order, Trump is an extinction-level event. It\u2019s long past time we started treating him as such.\n\n*This article appears in the May 2, 2016 issue of New York Magazine.",
