Republicans swear the law will bankrupt the country.\n\nAlright, whatever. Here's what nonpartisan experts have said.\n\nWill it reduce deficits or not? When the Affordable Care Act passed in March 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would reduce deficits by more than $100 billion in the first decade, and by considerably more in the second decade -- by half a percent of economic growth. A half percent of GDP over a decade could mean reducing deficits by more than $1 trillion.\n\nSo, what's the problem? The CBO's estimate assumes that the law would be adhered to exactly as written.\n\nExcept that almost never happens with big legislation.\n\nThe CBO itself noted that the ACA would \"put into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time.\"\n\nA number of changes have already been made, and more are being proposed -- some of which could diminish the law's deficit-reduction potential.\n\nFor instance, there's a push to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices. The tax is expected to raise about $30 billion over the next decade.\n\nAnd there is concern that Congress could have a hard time adhering to various cost containment provisions in the law, said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a deficit watchdog group.\n\nIf lawmakers keep messing with the law, then what?
