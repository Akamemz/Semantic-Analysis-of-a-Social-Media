Jeff Sessions , R-Ala. , and Tom Coburn , R-Okla .\nThe Associated Press reported this week that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson , who is conducting a review ordered by Obama on how to make the administration 's policy on deportations more humane , is weighing limiting removals of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who do n't have serious criminal records .\nThe change , if adopted , could shield tens of thousands of immigrants now removed each year solely because they committed repeat immigration violations , such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported , failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court date .\nWith comprehensive immigration legislation stalled in the GOP-led House 10 months after Senate passage , Obama is under intense pressure from immigrant advocates to act on his own to curb deportations and allow some of the 11.5 million immigrants in the country illegally to stay here .\nThe move would fall short of the sweeping changes sought by activists who want Obama to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups , such as the parents of any children born in the U.S .\nThursday 's letter , circulated by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's top Republican , Sen.
