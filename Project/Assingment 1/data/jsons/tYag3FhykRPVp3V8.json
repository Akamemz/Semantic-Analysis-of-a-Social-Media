It appears that the president , rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria , has chosen option three , the least bad alternative . And here 's why .\nThis is n't really an option . Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad 's use of chemical weapons . Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988 ; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict ; and the president is accused of fiddling , Nero-like , while Syria burns .\nJust focus on the events of the past five days in Washington .

And if the president does n't enforce it , he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term .\nNeither his regional allies ( Israel and the Saudis ) nor his adversaries ( Iran , Hezbollah , Russia ) will find him credible or believable . As it is now , everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence .\nFrom the beginning , Sens . John McCain and Lindsay Graham and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on Syria , even suggesting that the president , by not acting sooner , enabled all of this misery to unfold . Syria , the president 's critics maintain , is a major threat to U.S. interests -- and to our allies in the region -- and only a takedown of the al-Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem .\nThe argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no-fly zones , the use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition .\nPresident Obama has wisely and willfully avoided this approach .

It took eight months to get rid of Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi , and he had no weapons of mass destruction , no serious air defenses or military capacity and no credible allies .
