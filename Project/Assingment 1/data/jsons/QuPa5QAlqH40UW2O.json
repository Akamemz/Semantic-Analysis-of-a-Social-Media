When Trump holds a rally or takes to Twitter , half the nation seems to hold its breath \u2014 waiting for him to insult someone , snarl at a baby or maybe punt a puppy off the podium .\nWhy ? Because the contest has changed , the media context has changed \u2014 and Trump has been caught in a confluence of damaging stories .\nFirst , the contest has changed from a one-party affair to a national test . The long months of partisan infighting , debates , primaries and caucuses \u2014 culminating in the nominating convention \u2014 are now over . Much of the system of rewards and incentives , that process ingrained in the various contestants , is now irrelevant or even counterproductive .\nThe audience has increased both in size and attentiveness . The fall campaign is a far broader canvas , luring more than twice as many voters and a far more diverse mix of the population . As the demands of the audience change , the tenor of the appeals and the manner of the candidates usually does , too .\nThose who do not `` pivot to the general '' must deal with the consequences . Barry Goldwater in 1964 , George McGovern in 1972 and Walter Mondale in 1984 were all running against incumbents , a tough row to hoe . But all stayed the course that had sustained them in the primaries , believing they would inspire new voters and scramble the electoral map . They lost in the Electoral College by a combined score of 1,537 to 77 .\nThe media context changes , too , in the immediate aftermath of the conventions . The great winnowing is done ; the questions of the preceding 18 months have been answered . Focus shifts to a simpler , binary choice .\nThis new concentration can change the physics of the campaign . In the primary months , the usual laws of gravity did not seem to apply to Trump . The businessman and 70-year-old first-time candidate could say nearly anything about anyone . He could defy the norms of political discourse . Whatever damage he suffered was lost amid his mounting vote totals . In the end , he amassed nearly half the Republican vote \u2014 easily a plurality in a huge field of candidates .\nHe generated controversy wherever he went , yet seemed to thrive on it . Until now . Now suddenly the freewheeling Trump personality that had been a wellspring of success has become a gusher of miscues and offenses . It is as though someone somewhere suddenly found a switch and changed the polarity on the Trump phenomenon from positive to negative overnight .\nTed Cruz , Trump 's toughest primary foe , warned that the media were storing up bad stories about Trump to unload on him after he became the nominee . So far it has appeared more as though the media have looked on the everyday Trump with a different lens \u2014 while reprising some of the same stories that were first related months ago .\nTrump 's convention in Cleveland was successful enough . There were awkward moments and rough patches , but the guy who got booed off the stage was not Trump but Cruz . At the end , there was a big audience for Trump 's acceptance speech , a respectable bump in the polls and several days of being the front-runner for the fall .\nBut in the past five days , Trump has seen that lead vanish and become a double-digit deficit in some instances . Hillary Clinton got a boost from her own convention , but it grew with each passing day in August \u2014 reflecting the news and the impression that Trump himself was making . Clinton has gone from losing the advantage after the Republican convention , in an average of the national polls , to now holding a consistent lead . That lead has also grown in some state polls .\nThat negative news rush was full of Trump 's personal feuds , starting with a Gold Star family whose son , a U.S. Army captain , died in Iraq . The Khans appeared at the Democratic Convention to object to Trump 's proposed ban on Muslim immigration . Trump and his surrogates struck back at Khizr and Ghazala Khan in highly personal and even slanderous terms , leading to their being featured on countless websites and TV programs .\nThe Trump counterattack alienated millions , including veterans groups and military figures and Republicans for whom the parents of the fallen are sacrosanct .
