    "content": "( CNN ) -- In Cedar Rapids , Iowa , independent U.S. Senate candidate Rick Stewart made a bold proposal . He wants to end negative television advertising in the state . Stewart is not the first to call for this . Almost every election cycle , we hear proposals to bring an end to the nasty ads . There is always speculation that we have reached some kind of tipping point .\nBut in the end , the proposals never go far . The truth is that people hate negative ads , but they pay attention to them . Sometimes , candidates are publicly seen to go too far . Generally , however , the sky is the limit when it comes to negativity .\nWe 've been doing this for a long time . Fifty years ago , Democrats launched a new era in political advertising with the blistering Daisy television spot , a powerful and emotional advertisement that played to the worst fears of the electorate . With images of a young girl picking petals off a flower as a nuclear mushroom cloud is seen in her eyes , Democrats suggested that Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a right-wing zealot who was capable of starting a nuclear war . Vote for Johnson , Americans were told , or a nuclear holocaust could ensue .\nSince that time , campaign professionals have refined and mastered the art of the political spot . On television and radio , and now the Internet , they have developed all sorts of techniques to eviscerate their opponents .\nOn occasion , they broadcast positive ads trying to introduce themselves to voters . This year was no different .\nIn states that matter , voters have been bombarded with advertisements meant to frame the choices they face Tuesday .\nHere are some of the most memorable ads from this year :\nThe Catch Your Attention Ad : This goes to Iowa Republican Joni Ernst , who was barely known before she launched an ad boasting of her experience castrating hogs and promising to do the same when she came to Washington . `` I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm , so when I get to Washington , I 'll know how to cut pork . '' With a grin on her face and images of pigs on the screen , she says : `` Washington 's full of big spenders . Let 's make 'em squeal . ''\nErnst catapulted into the national stoplight and emerged as a serious contender for the Senate seat . The ad defined her as someone who was capable of taking on the Washington establishment , and its language jolted the media into giving her substantial coverage . Ernst now leads her Democratic opponent in the polls .\nThe Bad Taste Ad : The award in this category has to go to Wendy Davis , who , running for governor of Texas , broadcast an ad showing an image of an empty wheelchair . Viewers then heard about the ways that the Republican candidate , Greg Abbott , who is partly paralyzed , has opposed judicial compensation for victims , even though he received $ 10 million after being severely hurt by a fallen tree .\nWhile the Democrats insisted Davis never wanted to attack Abbott personally , the strategy did n't work well . She was forced to spend more time explaining and justifying than on promoting her message .\nThe Right to the Point Ad : Sometimes , effective campaign ads are most powerful when they get right to the point , just conveying their main message without any mystery or subtlety . This was the case in Arkansas , when Karl Rove 's American Crossroads organization broadcast an ad that tells viewers exactly what they are supposed to take away . The spot shows a spelling bee where a little girl is asked how to spell `` Pryor , '' as in Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor .\nShe asks the judges for a definition of the word . One of the judges says : `` Pryor , a Washington liberal , out of touch with Arkansas , voted with the Obama agenda 90 % . '' Soon after , the girl offers the spelling : `` O-B-A-M-A . '' The judges turn to each other with a smile , saying `` close enough , '' giving her the contest . This is just one of many GOP ads connecting a Democrat from Arkansas to the unpopular president . Similar versions ran in other states .\nThe Weak on Defense Ad : This has to go to Republicans in Georgia . In 2002 , the Georgia GOP used a `` weak on defense '' ad to boost the chances of Saxby Chambliss against Sen. Max Cleland , a Vietnam veteran who had lost his limbs in the war . With images linking Cleland to Osama bin Laden , the ad informed viewers that Cleland had opposed President Bush 's homeland security proposal . Chambliss won the race .\nThis year , in the race to replace Chambliss , the state has seen more of the same . Republicans ran a misleading ad warning that , according to a leaked campaign memo for the Democratic campaign , Democrat Michelle Nunn ran a nonprofit organization that gave money to organizations linked to terrorism . Even Neil Bush spoke out against the advertisement . His father , former President George H.W . Bush , founded the Points of Light Foundation that she headed . `` It really makes my blood boil to think that someone would make that kind of an allegation , '' Neil Bush said .\nThe Shoot-Em-Up Ad : Shooting guns has become a popular feature in campaign ads . In certain parts of the country , having your candidate -- Democrat or Republican -- fire off a rifle has become a sign of legitimacy , a signal that they understand the value of gun rights . It 's hard to pick the best of the lot since there were many this year . Perhaps the award should go to Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes , shown skeet shooting and explaining : `` Mitch McConnell wants you to think I 'm Barack Obama . ... I 'm not Barack Obama . I disagree with him on guns , coal and the EPA . '' And `` Mitch , '' she adds , shaking her head , as viewers see an image of McConnell awkwardly holding a gun at an NRA convention , `` that 's not how you hold a gun . ''\nThe Soft on Crime Card : There have been a number of ads tapping into the sentiment of 1988 when a group supporting George H.W . Bush 's campaign ran a racially loaded ad about a convict who had been let out for a weekend furlough in Massachusetts and raped a woman while he was free . This year , Democrat Mark Begich took a page from that strategy suggesting that while he was the state 's attorney general , his Republican opponent Dan Sullivan had responsibility for a sex offender who had been let out of prison and went on to commit murder and a sexual assault .\nThe ad has a police officer contending that Sullivan set many sex offenders free . `` One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building , murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their 2-year-old granddaughter . '' Sullivan released a statement saying that `` He is lying to Alaskans and using the murder of an elderly couple and the sexual assault of a 2-year-old for his own political gain , and it 's despicable . ''\nBegich was forced to pull the ad , and he has encountered intense criticism for running it . Sullivan 's team expressed its opposition through an ad called `` Shameful .
