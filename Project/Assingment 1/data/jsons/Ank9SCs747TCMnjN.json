Overwhelming majorities -- including among Catholics and Republicans -- think birth control is `` morally acceptable , '' which , sure , is a pretty low bar but is certainly something . But perhaps the more relevant data point here is that a majority of Americans , 54 percent , support the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act . That support is even stronger -- 62 percent -- among women voters , the voters that Republicans are really going to need to win over to ensure their survival . The GOP 's pathological opposition to the contraceptive requirement of the new healthcare law -- as well as state-level assaults on clinics and support for personhood amendments that would greatly compromise access to contraception among other things -- puts them on the outs with where most Americans are on these issues .\nWhen it comes to young voters , college graduates , single women and black and Latino voters , support for contraception is really , really strong . According to data from 2012 , 81 percent of black Americans and 79 percent of Hispanic Americans strongly support expanding access to birth control . More than 60 percent of millennial voters support the birth control mandate .\nThese are the people Republicans need to win elections , and these are the people who Democrats hope are listening when they put Republicans on the spot to defend their records . Talking about religious liberty may not be enough anymore ; advocating for increased access to over-the-counter methods of birth control may no longer cut it when employer insurance plans are trying to drop highly effective and costly methods like the copper IUD that ca n't be obtained in pharmacies .

Shaking the anti-woman , retro-misogynist label will be even tougher for Republicans like Mitch McConnell who are fighting to bolster the Hobby Lobby decision by letting bosses everywhere deny employees all manner of contraception . Or for Scott Walker , who is trying to make nice with moderate America in advance of a likely presidential run , but is also making the Hobby Lobby ruling the law of the land in his state .
