Talk of putting Social Security and other safety net programs on a more sustainable path has also been put to the side . Now , with deficits down , Mr. Obama is focused on boosting the middle class and reducing income inequality . That means higher taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations and more government spending .\n\u201c What I \u2019 d like to see is not only that the economy continues to grow , but I also want to make sure that everybody \u2019 s benefiting , \u201d Obama told NBC News Sunday , looking ahead to his final two years in office .\nThe result is a nearly $ 4 trillion federal budget plan for fiscal 2016 that ditches what Obama calls \u201c mindless austerity \u201d and raises spending for domestic priorities \u2013 foremost on education , infrastructure , and tax relief for middle-income Americans \u2013 as well as on national security . By proposing higher defense spending , Obama hopes to lure Republicans into a deal .\nMany Republicans agree that the \u201c sequester \u201d \u2013 the automatic , across-the-board spending cuts put in place two years ago \u2013 is a bad way to budget . But they \u2019 re not ready to go along with what Obama has in mind . And so while deficits are down , that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean Washington is on the verge of a spending spree .\nPolitical reality points to a tough slog ahead . Republicans now control both houses of Congress , and if they can agree amongst themselves on what to present Obama \u2013 and that \u2019 s a big \u201c if \u201d \u2013 he could face tough choices of his own later this year to keep the government running .\nWhat \u2019 s more , deficit hawks have hardly given up . They point to retiring Baby Boomers and the prospect of skyrocketing interest payments on the debt with alarm . Though annual deficits have shrunk markedly from the early Obama years , they will begin to rise again in 2018 , reaching $ 1.1 trillion in 2025 , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week .
