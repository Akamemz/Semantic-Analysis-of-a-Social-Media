    "content": "Donald Trump is officially the president of the United States of America . Libertarians have plenty of reasons to be worried .\nHis inaugural speech today was an extended defense of populist protectionism , much like his campaign . From trade to defense spending to entitlements to immigration , Trump has repeatedly promised to take America in a direction that is less open , less free , and more burdened by an oppressive and expansive federal government .\nHere are nine reasons why libertarians should be very concerned about a Trump presidency :\n1 ) He has repeatedly promised to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants upon taking office , relying on a `` special deportation force '' to carry out the task . And even in the occasional moments in which he has seemed to recognize that this task would be logistically impossible , he has continued to insist that he will deport several million people right away , and that other undocumented immigrants who are in the country will not have a path to citizenship unless they leave the country first .\n2 ) More generally , Trump 's attitude toward immigrants and outsiders ranges from disdain to outright hostility . He has called for a ban on Muslim immigration and the closure of mosques , and he opened his primary campaign by declaring that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. were rapists and criminals .\n3 ) Trump has also promised to build a massive , expensive wall along the southern border , and has insisted that Mexico will pay for its construction , an absurd notion that is already crumbling , as the incoming administration has asked Congress , not Mexico , to pay for the wall .\n4 ) Trump has made clear that his administration will take a much more aggressive stance on trade as well . During the campaign , he floated the idea of a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods , which would be deeply harmful to consumers and the U.S. economy . Since winning the election , his administration has raised the possibility of a 10 percent tariff on all imports , a policy that could spark a global recession . After winning in November , he said he would pull the nation out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement on day one of his presidency .\n5 ) Trump 's authoritarian leanings extend to national security as well . He has said that he would institute a program of torture for suspected terrorists that goes beyond what went on in the Bush administration , and has also said that he would kill the families of terrorists . When informed that military commanders might resist such an order , Trump said that he would force them to commit war crimes .\n6 ) The new president has a dim view of constitutional free speech protections too . The First Amendment , he said , provides `` too much protection '' for free speech . He complained that in the U.S. `` our press is allowed to say whatever they want . '' On the campaign trail , he said he wanted to `` open up '' libel laws , and threatened to take action against the owner of The Washington Post after the paper published material he did n't like . He thinks flag burning should be illegal , and has repeatedly used the legal system to punish those who irritate him .\n7 ) Trump has shown no interest in meaningful budget reforms : He has repeatedly said he will not cut Medicare , Medicaid , or Social Security\u2014all of which are facing trillions in unfunded liabilities and are among the biggest drivers of the nation 's long-term debt\u2014and he has criticized Republicans for wanting to pare back spending on those programs . He has also proposed increasing defense spending . Under his campaign plans , federal debt would rise by more than $ 10 trillion over the next decade .\n8 ) As a real estate developer , Trump repeatedly sought to use eminent domain to enable the seizure of private homes to make way for commercial developments . On the campaign trail , he defended the use of government muscle to take private property , saying `` I think eminent domain is wonderful . ''\n9 ) Perhaps more worrying than anything else , though , is Trump 's long and well documented history of admiration for dictators and authoritarian leaders . He has praised Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Kim Jong-Un of North Korea , and lauded Vladimir Putin of Russia for his strength as a leader . On the campaign trail , he referred to the 1989 Chinese political protests in Tiananmen Square as a `` riot '' and marveled at the toughness the Chinese government 's murderous response show . `` They put it down with strength , '' Trump told Playboy in 1989 . `` That shows you the power of strength .
