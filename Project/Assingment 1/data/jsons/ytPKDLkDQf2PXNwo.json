    "content": "President Obama has been getting a lot of grief in the last few weeks over his pledge that with the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) in place , people would be able to keep their insurance if they like it . The media have been filled with stories about people across the country who are having their insurance policies terminated , ostensibly because they did not meet the requirements of the ACA . While this has led many to say that Obama was lying , there is much less here than meets the eye .\nFirst , it is important to note that the ACA grand-fathered all the individual policies that were in place at the time the law was enacted . This means that the plans in effect at the time that President Obama was pushing the bill could still be offered even if they did not meet all the standards laid out in the ACA .\nThe plans being terminated because they do n't meet the minimal standards were all plans that insurers introduced after the passage of the ACA . Insurers introduced these plans knowing that they would not meet the standards that would come into effect in 2014 .

After all , President Obama did not promise people that he would keep insurers from developing new plans that will not comply with the provisions of the ACA .\nIn addition to the new plans that were created that did not comply with the terms of the ACA , there have been complaints that the grandfathering was too strict . For example , insurers can only raise their premiums or deductibles by a small amount above the rate of medical inflation .

The price increases charged by insurers are not events outside of the control of insurers . If an insurer offers a plan which has many committed buyers , then presumably it would be able to structure its changes in ways that are consistent with the ACA .
