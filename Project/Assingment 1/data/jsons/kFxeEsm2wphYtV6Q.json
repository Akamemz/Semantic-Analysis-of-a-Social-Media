    "content": "A U.S. Army convoy passing through a Kurdish-held part of Iraq on its way to a base in Erbil on Monday .\nERBIL , Iraq\u2014Civilians in Kurdish areas hurled fruit and insults at a U.S. troop convoy that crossed from northern Syria into Iraq early Monday , venting anger over a withdrawal they see as the U.S. betraying its allies in the fight against Islamic State .\nAs a large convoy of military vehicles flying American flags rolled across northern Iraq toward a base in Erbil , U.S. officials including President Trump said several hundred U.S. troops would remain in northeast Syria to protect oil fields there . But most are leaving , and as stony-faced U.S. soldiers on the move flashed victory signs , a young man in the Iraqi town of Bardarash flipped a middle finger at the convoy as it passed through .\nIn the dusty rolling hills north of Mosul , the row of American flags on the side of the armored vehicles could be seen from far away . Before reaching Erbil , separate parts of the convoy joined together to form a line of at least 50 vehicles , including white Land Cruisers .\nDuring a roadside break , the soldiers didn \u2019 t return greetings and retreated immediately and silently into their vehicles when The Wall Street Journal approached them . Earlier in the day , onlookers in the predominantly Kurdish area cursed the soldiers as they passed by , according to a man in Duhok , about 37 miles from the Syrian border . One man called them \u201c sons of bitches \u201d and shouted at them to get out , he said .\n\u201c We are disappointed , \u201d said Mahmoud Salah , a Syrian Kurdish worker in the Iraqi town of Kalak who said his cousin died fighting alongside the Americans . He considered the U.S. withdrawal a betrayal , he said . \u201c We will always think that , \u201d he added as he watched the convoy drive past .\nThe line of military vehicles conveying part of the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops ordered to leave Syria faced the greatest hostility inside Syria as it left the country . A video posted by the dominant political party in northeast Syria , the Democratic Union Party , showed demonstrators temporarily blocking the convoy with hand-drawn signs , including one that read : \u201c To the U.S. Army who are leaving northeast Syria now tell your children that the children of the Kurds were killed by the Turks and we did nothing to protect them. \u201d Young men could be seen throwing stones and fruit at the convoy in footage posted by television network ABC \u2019 s Adam Harvey .\nHostility from the Kurds could complicate future U.S. operations in the region , including efforts to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State and maintain control over Syria \u2019 s oil fields . The Kurds were the U.S. \u2019 s main partners in the fight against the extremist group in Syria , and they see the American pullback as a historic act of treachery that leaves them exposed to attacks by Turkey , which regards the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists .\nAnkara launched a cross-border offensive nearly two weeks ago to seize territory and create a safe zone along its border with Syria . It agreed with Washington to a five-day cease-fire\u2014which ends late on Tuesday\u2014to allow the Kurds to leave the area . Turkey \u2019 s incursion marks a pivotal point in Syria \u2019 s multisided conflict .\nThe Kurds could aim to cede the area they control in northeastern Syria , including the major oil fields there , to the Russia and Iran-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad as a defense against Turkey , analysts say . Such a shift would allow the Assad regime to reassert sway over most of the country after more than eight years of civil war , and complicate any American effort to control that oil .\nOn Tuesday , Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to host Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Russian resort town of Sochi . A central point of discussion will likely be divvying up oversight over the border areas between Russia and Turkey .\nThough some U.S. troops left Syria earlier , the convoy on Monday appeared to be the largest movement since Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision to pull troops from the country \u2019 s northeast .\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper , speaking Monday at a press conference at a U.S. military headquarters in Kabul , said administration officials have discussed keeping a residual force in northeast Syria to \u201c deny access to the oil fields \u201d to groups like Islamic State .\nAreas of control , Oct. 21 Syrian government Turkish army Kurdish forces and allies Turkish army/Syrian opposition forces Opposition forces Iraqi government 50 miles turkey 50 km Duhok Kobani iran Sheikhan Hasakah Mosul Erbil Aleppo Raqqa Deir Ezzour iraq Euphrates R.
