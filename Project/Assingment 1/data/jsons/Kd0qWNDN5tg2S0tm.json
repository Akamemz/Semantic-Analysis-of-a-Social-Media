She's experienced\n\nIf Clinton is elected, she'll have more foreign policy experience than any president since George H.W. Bush.

While she hasn't advocated large-scale ground operations, she has pushed for the creation of \"safe zones\" in Syria, and she was a strong advocate for the U.S. military intervention in Libya. \"Her default preference seems to be for action,\" Saunders said. \"People have described her as having a preference for being 'caught trying.'
