Kamala Harris \u2019 ( D-CA ) presidential campaign , it was an opportunity .\nShortly after the document \u2019 s release , Harris \u2019 staff was circulating a video of her tough questioning of Barr during his confirmation hearing to get her back into the national conversation .\n\u201c Sen . Kamala Harris absolutely nailed AG Bill Barr back in May and now he \u2019 s in big trouble , \u201d the progressive website Daily Kos \u2019 account tweeted .

The crowds , the money , and the momentum all aligned following her January launch . Six months later , the first Democratic debate in June\u2014where Harris landed a powerful blow against Biden\u2014only helped crystallize a star on the rise .\nBut since that moment her campaign has struggled to replicate those initial boosts . A series of national and early state polls released in recent days provide a grim glimpse into the California Democrat \u2019 s current standing , plummeting in some cases to low single digits and leaving Democrats to question what a plausible path forward would look like .\nInterviews with more than 10 Democratic operatives and activists with deep ties to Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina reveal a series of missteps in Harris \u2019 presidential campaign : not showing up enough in some places , and in others failing to knock Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) off track .\n\u201c Warren is the clearest example of a candidate who is prosecuting a worldview .

While things can change in the months before the first votes are cast , Democrats caution that a weak performance from Harris in Iowa and New Hampshire , where she has struggled to break out of the single digits , means she risks a dangerous ripple effect elsewhere .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to put Iowa first , \u201d Adams said in a recent call with reporters . Harris plans to visit the state each week in October , Adams said , and will add 60 additional full-time organizers and open up 10 new offices .\nIn talks about the influential state , Democrats often point to former President Obama \u2019 s success in the 2008 caucus as a pivotal turn-around moment for his historic campaign . \u201c By this point in 2007 Barack Obama had been three times , \u201d Steven Drahozal , chair of the Dubuque County Democrats , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . With the smart money at the time on Hillary Clinton , Obama won the caucus after a breakout performance at the Democrats \u2019 annual J-J Dinner . The rest is history .\nNeed another example ? Just look to 2004 and then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry , who was at one point on life support in a multi-field contest . After firing parts of his campaign staff and camping out in Iowa , he won the caucus with 37 percent of the vote and went on to secure the Democratic nomination .\nThe most optimistic outcome for Harris would be cobbling together a similar route to success . And while strategists and activists agree it \u2019 s hardly too late for the California senator to pull off a surprise victory , warning signs are popping up for her campaign in Iowa and beyond .\n\u201c In June she said we were going to be seeing her a lot , \u201d Drahozal said . \u201c We have not heard back from her directly . \u201d\nJoAnn Hardy , the chair of Cerro Gordo County Democrats , said that while many voters remain undecided in their final pick , a few months ahead of the Feb. 3 caucus is not too early to start locking down support .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t do what they did . They made a huge error in strategy . \u201d \u2014 Joe Trippi , Democratic strategist\n\u201c We \u2019 re starting to see people choose candidates . You \u2019 ve got to get in there before that happens , \u201d Hardy said . \u201c I \u2019 m hearing she \u2019 s moving to Iowa , but she has a lot of ground to make up . \u201d\nJoe Trippi , a Democratic strategist who \u2019 s worked on multiple past presidential campaigns , including for Kerry \u2019 s 2004 rival former Vermont Governor Howard Dean , stressed the unpredictable nature of the race , but criticized what he sees as an initial blunder .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t do what they did , \u201d Trippi said about Harris \u2019 early Iowa maneuvering . \u201c They made a huge error in strategy . \u201d\nIn both early contests , it \u2019 s hard to mention the name Kamala Harris without hearing a follow-up point about Warren , who has in recent days surged ahead of Biden for the first time in Iowa and New Hampshire , and well ahead of Harris . Hailing from neighboring Massachusetts , Warren came in at 27 percent in a Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire released on Wednesday . Harris dropped to 3 percent , down 3 points from her 6 percent in the survey in May .\n\u201c If the strategy is New Hampshire is not important to their campaign , that \u2019 s an OK strategy , but don \u2019 t get mad when people point it out , \u201d one Democrat who has long worked in the state said .\nJudy Reardon , a Democratic activist and former longtime adviser to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-NH ) , wondered about the initial strategy for the first-in-the-nation primary .\nHarris has been questioned about whether she \u2019 s actually focused on the New Hampshire primary but consistently said she \u2019 s committed to the state . In a campaign briefing memo obtained by Politico , Harris \u2019 talking points to Granite Staters reportedly included a line to emphasize that \u201c NH absolutely a priority for my campaign\u2014excited to be back for the convention and other events around the state. \u201d Two days after attending the New Hampshire Democratic Party \u2019 s state convention , Dwight Davis , the vice president of the party \u2019 s African-American caucus , endorsed Harris .\nTaking place 18 days after New Hampshire , the primary in South Carolina , where Harris \u2019 campaign has spent significant resources building a ground game , becomes more difficult to win if she can \u2019 t pull off a strong showing in the first two contests , Democrats in all three states emphasized . Prior to a recent visit on Saturday , Harris hadn \u2019 t been to the state in more than 70 days .\n\u201c For Kamala , what happened in these states is that she didn \u2019 t stake out a lane and stay focused in that lane . \u201d \u2014 Democratic strategist in South Carolina\nHarris \u2019 campaign declined to comment for this story but pointed to a recent briefing call with reporters that detailed new aspects of its early state strategies . In South Carolina , her campaign intends to double its staff in November .\nThe most recent CBS News/YouGov poll taken between Aug. 28 and Sept. 4 placed Harris at 7 percent in South Carolina . While she \u2019 s spent significantly more time there than in the first two contests , most recently for the Charleston NAACP \u2019 s annual Freedom Fund Banquet , Democrats in the state say Biden \u2019 s long-standing ties there and Warren \u2019 s recent surge elsewhere complicate Harris \u2019 path forward .\n\u201c The vice president has made South Carolina something close to being his second home , \u201d Don Fowler , a former leader of the South Carolina Democratic Party , said . Biden \u2019 s support in the African-American community , he added , will likely stay strong for the next two or three months , but it might take a conclusive turn after January , as Iowa \u2019 s caucus nears .\n\u201c For Kamala , what happened in these states is that she didn \u2019 t stake out a lane and stay focused in that lane , \u201d one Democratic strategist in the state unaffiliated with any campaign , said . \u201c I think she underestimated the strength in the black community of Joe Biden , and she underestimated the strength of the progressive community \u201d for Warren .",
