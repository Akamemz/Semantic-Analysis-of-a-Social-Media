    "content": "Wall Street titan Stephen Schwarzman has recently taken on a new , informal job : counselor to the president .\nThe CEO of Blackstone Group , who has known Trump for years , has become so close to the president that the two sometimes talk several times a week , covering everything from Chinese trade to tax policy to immigration .\nWhite House and New York business officials say Schwarzman was critical to Trump keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , also known as the Dreamers program , with Trump making the decision after a call with the hedge fund billionaire . The two also recently chatted at Mar-a-Lago about a possible reorganization of the White House , two people familiar with the meeting say , though the conversation did n't include specific names .\nSchwarzman 's growing influence in Trump 's circle is welcome news to New York business leaders and moderate Republicans , who want the president to abandon his nationalist positions and embrace a more nonideological White House amid lagging poll ratings and infighting dominating the West Wing .\nIn private conversations , a number of Trump 's friends have told him he could be more popular \u2014 and accomplish more \u2014 if he embraced a moderate streak and listened to his business friends . Jared Kushner , the president 's son-in-law , is trying to orchestrate more power for New York business types , particularly National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn , while diminishing the power of chief strategist Steve Bannon , who drives the populist wing of the White House .\n\u201c The president is a business person , so he \u2019 s very comfortable being around business people and he learns best by talking to people and observing things , \u201d Schwarzman said in an interview after meeting on Tuesday with Trump and other business leaders . \u201c I think he looks forward to these things and he likes being with business people who have run businesses that are bigger than his . It \u2019 s just a highly supportive environment , whether it \u2019 s Gary Cohn or Jared , certainly Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross and Dina Powell , these are all people who \u2019 ve had very similar experiences . \u201d\nOne executive in regular contact with West Wing officials said it \u2019 s encouraging that Trump appears to be embracing more pragmatic allies . \u201c It seems like he \u2019 s relying now on nonideological people like Gary who have business experience and just know how to execute and get stuff done , \u201d the executive said .\nAny possible shift certainly comes with risks . Democrats are never likely to embrace Trump . And the president could alienate his core supporters after winning the election by catering to blue-collar workers , mocking Hillary Clinton 's paid speeches on Wall Street , and railing against the influence of elites and special interests .\nInside the White House , Bannon has at times clashed with Cohn and Kushner and has advocated for more strident positions . Cohn 's rising influence has already attracted attacks from Bannon allies , and Kushner has drawn negative attention from conservative blogs . Several Trump campaign veterans have lambasted Cohn 's influence in the White House . `` He would be an Obama appointee at best , '' one longtime adviser said .\nWhether Trump will be willing to modulate significantly from the scorched-earth strategy that won him the White House , and whether he wants more discipline in the White House , remains unclear . What has attracted him to much of his base is railing against trade deals that Wall Street executives like , building a massive border wall and implementing stricter immigration policies that they do n't like . And he often avoids even the best-crafted advice by firing off an errant tweet .\nAnother executive said a summit last week with CEOs created good feelings about the White House , but some of that changed later in the week when Cohn suggested he would support separating investment and retail banking on Wall Street , something big banks strongly oppose .\n\u201c Yes , everyone left that meeting feeling good about the White House and the agenda and then we wake up on Thursday and Gary is saying he wants to break us up , \u201d the executive said . \u201c It could be that he sort of backed into it because it was in the Republican platform and that nothing will happen with it , but it still bothered people . \u201d\nThis executive also said it was too soon to suggest Trump would really back away from ripping up existing trade deals or slapping tariffs on Mexico , China or other nations the president views as unfair competitors . \u201c Trade in this administration is very complicated and there are so many players with different agendas jockeying for position , \u201d the executive said .\nStill , corporate executives who have attended White House meetings say they are becoming increasingly confident that Cohn , along with Kushner and senior White House adviser Dina Powell , also a former Goldman executive , have for the moment at least neutralized Trump \u2019 s more aggressively nationalistic advisers including Bannon and senior aide Stephen Miller . Cohn has become Trump 's preferred adviser as of late , several people say , as Bannon has faded .\nAnd some business leaders are convinced the White House will change , \u201c or look totally different in six months , \u201d as one business executive said .\nOne senior White House official noted the quickly executed Syria action as an example of the administration operating at a higher professional level and said it should give the outside world , including corporate America , confidence about improvements in West Wing functioning .\nAt a recent meeting with New York CEOs , Cohn signaled he would be in charge of infrastructure and tax reform , a reassuring sign to these leaders , and told them the White House had much in common with Wall Street and real estate developers .
