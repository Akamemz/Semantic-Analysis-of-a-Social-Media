There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nMany note that \u201c Biden \u2019 s opposition to [ marijuana ] legalization\u2026 puts him at odds with the great majority of Democrats , 75-plus percent of whom back legalization . Biden \u2019 s opposition even puts him at odds with the median Republican , with polls showing that even a majority of Republicans support legalization . Politically , then , legalization should be low-hanging fruit \u2026 Yet Biden is not quite there\u2026 It \u2019 s an especially bad look for Biden . He has a long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies \u2014 not just supporting but actually writing many of the laws in the 1980s and \u2019 90s that helped shape America \u2019 s modern war on drugs . For Biden to hang on to marijuana prohibition , then , just reinforces one of the major concerns that criminal justice reformers like Booker have about him. \u201d German Lopez , Vox\n\u201c In a marked contrast from several past debates , gender equity took center stage at Wednesday \u2019 s Democratic debate , which featured wide-ranging discussion about paid family leave , abortion rights , and the higher standards that women candidates must meet\u2026 Yang \u2019 s comment highlighted a startling reality : Among developed countries , the US is the only one that does not have a paid leave program , a policy that \u2019 s been shown to increase women \u2019 s workforce participation , reduce family \u2019 s reliance on public assistance , and improve children \u2019 s health outcomes. \u201d Li Zhou , Vox\n\u201c A few minutes on one night might not be the dream scenario for affordable housing advocates , but there \u2019 s some value just in asking . Studies have shown that simply being discussed at a presidential debate is a form of validation that elevates the significance of an issue in the eyes of voters . Hopefully viewers won \u2019 t have to wait so long to hear more. \u201d Tim Murphy , Mother Jones\nNonetheless , \u201c This was the debate that sent a signal that Democrats differ far more with Trump and the Republicans than they do with each other . The question that came to mind after some of the harsh and more narrowly focused brawls earlier in the year was : How could this party possibly unite ? The question that dominated on Wednesday was : Do these contenders really disagree all that much ? Of course , they do disagree , as Warren and Sanders especially wanted to make clear by way of contrast with their more moderate adversaries . But it was a salutary break from an all-Trump , all-the-time Washington to hear discourses on how to build houses , how to make college affordable and how to help families care for their kids . \u201d E.J . Dionne Jr. , Washington Post\n\u201c During the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night , the moderators asked Buttigieg specifically what he would do differently from former President Barack Obama , who also used rhetoric about unity but faced eight years of entrenched Republican opposition . Buttigieg didn \u2019 t really have an answer . \u201d Amanda Terkel , Huffington Post\n\u201c During the debate , each of these candidates answered questions playing to their strengths ; Warren landed a punch with an exchange on her wealth tax , Biden talked about foreign policy and the lack of civility in America , Sanders touched on his signature issue of Medicare-for-all , and Buttigieg took time to pitch himself a moderate alternative to the left wing of the Democratic Party\u2026 The night gave all four frontrunners some wins , and a few losses . Still , not much happened to dramatically reshape the state of the race. \u201d Ella Nilsen , Vox\nThe right sees Buttigieg and Biden as the winners of the debate , and criticizes the answers on housing and foreign policy .\nThe right sees Buttigieg and Biden as the winners of the debate , and criticizes the answers on housing and foreign policy .\n\u201c Tonight \u2019 s debate \u2014 perhaps overshadowed by the impeachment hearings \u2014 was an oddly flat showcase for the candidates , where almost every candidate seemed content to tread water and play it safe\u2026\n\u201c Right now , Pete Buttigieg is leading in Iowa , Elizabeth Warren is leading in New Hampshire , and Joe Biden is leading in Nevada , in South Carolina , and nationally . Time is on the side of those leading candidates . Everybody else should have been making an argument against one of them , but attacks on any of them were few and far between . Judging from the anodyne tone and relatively few direct confrontations between candidates , everyone must be pretty happy with where they are right now . Congratulations , Biden , Warren and Buttigieg . You walked onto that stage in good shape , and you \u2019 re walking off in good shape . \u201d\n\u201c Mayor Pete was the big winner of the debate , even on defense . Nobody managed to ding him\u2026 Throughout the campaign so far , every time a candidate has started gaining on Joe Biden , they \u2019 ve [ faced ] a barrage of attacks meant to stop their momentum . The question of the night was whether lovable Mayor Pete could survive a knife fight with seasoned political warriors . He did\u2026\n\u201c The socialists , Warren and Sanders , were an afterthought . Harris was impassioned but ineffective . Look for this to be a continuing theme . They lost this debate badly because their messages don \u2019 t appeal beyond Park Slope and the Bay Area\u2026 This debate pointed to a Biden-vs.-Buttigieg primary . The more extreme candidates are falling back . The Democrats who want to be the adults in the room are winning . And that is good news for the Democratic Party . \u201d\n\u201c Elizabeth Warren is exactly right that the nation has a housing deficiency . Too bad she absurdly asserted it 's because the government was n't doing enough . From the suburbs of San Francisco and Los Angeles to the heart of Manhattan , Democratic city and state regulations have hindered housing development to disastrous proportions . Zoning initiatives on the West Coast for single-family homes have exacerbated commute times and homelessness , and rent control pushes have failed to ameliorate rising housing costs in the East\u2026\n\u201c There 's no question that redlining laws within our grandparent 's lifetimes discriminated against people of color in abhorrent ways\u2026 But the housing crises faced by recent immigrants from the southern border and fleeing suburbanites in blue metropolitan areas across the country have n't come from the laws of decades past . They 're products of economic hogwash enforced to this very day , illustrated by a 29 % increase in regulatory costs from 2011 to 2016 and reflected in a halting rate of housing development . The problem runs so deep that the Council of Economic Advisors found [ relaxing ] California zoning laws would collapse rent prices by more than half in the Bay and nearly as much in Los Angeles . \u201d\nFinally , \u201c There are good arguments against President Trump 's foreign policy . North Korea , for example , retains its nuclear weapons program and is moving towards a resumption of long-range missile tests . China continues to consolidate its control over the Pacific Rim . Iran is readying a nuclear breakout . Vladimir Putin is heartened by the partisan impeachment battles over Ukraine . These are issues that the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls should jump on to offer serious alternatives . But they didn't\u2026\n\u201c Instead , Democrats on Wednesday offered a mix of platitudes and weakness . Take the responses to a question from Andrea Mitchell as to whether they would ostracize Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over his murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Joe Biden said little , Amy Kloubachar paused and said , \u2018 We need a new foreign policy , \u2019 and Cory Booker said , \u2018 The values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with. \u2019 Wow , thanks , Cory \u2014 that profound line will really scare our enemies\u2026 None of this is a recipe for American leadership or security . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
