    "content": "Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered all military personnel returning from Ebola response missions in West Africa to be held in a 21-day quarantine .\nHagel signed the order Wednesday morning , accepting a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The Army days earlier had imposed such a policy on its own servicemembers , but the new order applies to all branches .\n`` The fact is the military will have more Americans in Liberia than any other department , '' Hagel said , explaining his decision at Wednesday 's `` Washington Ideas Forum . '' He also said military families had discussed the idea , and `` very much wanted a safety valve on this . ''\nThe decision by Hagel further drives the divisions among the White House -- which has downplayed the need for mandatory quarantines -- and a range of other policymakers , particularly at the state level .\nCalifornia , the latest state to enact a tighter policy than the federal government , on Wednesday announced a 21-day quarantine for travelers from the hot-zone in West Africa who came in contact with infected individuals .\nIn Maine , the returning nurse who battled New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie over her mandatory quarantine also is now battling her home state after returning to Maine .\nMaine health officials are in the process of filing a court order to force Kaci Hickox to comply with the state 's `` voluntary '' 21-day quarantine period for health care workers who treated Ebola patients . Hickox , on Wednesday , told NBC 's `` Today '' that she does n't `` plan on sticking to the guidelines '' and is `` appalled '' by the home quarantine policies `` forced '' on her .\n`` I truly believe this policy is not scientifically nor constitutionally just , and so I 'm not going to sit around and be bullied around by politicians and be forced to stay in my home when I am not a risk to the American public , '' she said , saying she 's in `` perfectly good health . ''\nPresident Obama and his top health advisers also have played down the need for blanket quarantine policies for health care workers . The White House , though , has left open the door for the Pentagon to impose its own policies , arguing that the military and health workers are two entirely separate issues .\nHagel noted , for instance , that many of those in the military are not `` volunteers '' for the Ebola mission .\nPentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said the number of troops quarantined at a base in Italy is now at 42 , up from 11 a day earlier .\nA statement issued from the Pentagon said all returning servicemembers would be subjected to a 21-day `` controlled monitoring , '' which is effectively a quarantine .\nHagel ordered the Joint Chiefs to develop a detailed implementation plan for review within 15 days .\nHe also wants the Joint Chiefs to conduct a review of the new policies within 45 days -- from there , they 'll determine whether to continue the quarantines .",
