Ultimately, that delay was extended to a vague \"more time.\"\n\nWho Fares Worst?\n\nIn some cases, groups most loyal to President Obama have fared poorly under the law's recent delays.\n\nWhile 71 percent of Latinos voted in 2012 for Obama, Spanish-speakers needed to wait over two months for their version of HealthCare.gov, Cuidadodesalud.gov. In September 2013, the White House said Spanish-speakers would need to wait just three to four more weeks. The White House is still facing complaints that the site was not translated correctly.\n\nThe Longest Delay\n\nAmericans who work at companies employing 50-99 workers in the 36 states that use HealthCare.gov expected their employers to be required to offer them health insurance on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nAfter a pair of one-year delays, they will be guaranteed work-provided insurance -- but only in 2016.

On Dec. 24, 2013, more time was offered to those who wanted to sign up for coverage that would start in 2014 but could not because of HealthCare.gov's glitches. The deadline to choose January coverage was originally Dec. 23, but the last day to sign up for coverage retroactive to January has not been declared -- other than March 31, the scheduled final day to choose a plan for this coverage year.\n\nDemocrats and the Health Care Law\n\nThirteen Senate Democrats, or over a quarter of the caucus, have openly distanced themselves from the law's rollout. Those Democrats have largely been in favor of further delays or extensions, staving off the law's regulations. Since the October rollout, no Democrat has introduced legislation to bar the White House's delays, which would in turn speed along the rollout.\n\nAll changes to the law directed by the White House have slackened the Affordable Care Act's original intent and regulation start-dates.\n\nIf no additional delays are pushed beyond 2016, Obama is set to see the law fully implemented for no more than one quarter of his time in office.",
