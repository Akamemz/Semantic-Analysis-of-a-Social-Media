( Ints Kalnins/Reuters )\nThe sugary praise , often from former critics , does his memory no favors .\nThe past week has featured so much extravagant praise of John McCain that Jill Abramson , the former editor of the New York Times , had to admit \u201c McCain would cringe over some of the glowing tributes pouring in . \u201d\nIn death , McCain had finally become one with the country that was the object of his deepest faith , and any praise lavished on him , during the funeral proceedings or at any point afterward , would redound to the greater glory of America .\nYes , of course , John McCain was an American hero . But his sudden elevation to superhero status demonstrates one reason so many Americans view the media and the political establishment with skepticism . Many must have wondered whether they were getting the \u201c real McCain \u201d story or being fed a thinly veiled political message . As Joe Concha of The Hill newspaper asked ,\nIf the senator had gotten along with Trump , perhaps voted for the \u201c skinny repeal \u201d of Obamacare that he so famously shot down with one vote change at the 11th hour , hadn \u2019 t publicly called Trump \u201c disgraceful , \u201d would we see this level of reverence ?\nMany commenters rightly criticized President Trump \u2019 s churlishness toward John McCain . But when it was revealed that Sarah Palin , his 2008 vice-presidential running mate \u2014 who has never said a negative word about McCain and indeed expressed only gratitude toward him \u2014 was being excluded from his funeral and memorial services , the same pundits were silent . Noticing the public rebuke of Palin would have interrupted the narrative of John McCain as an example of what \u2019 s best and noble in our politics .\nDana Milbank of the Washington Post led the parade of puffery earlier this year when he declared McCain \u201c the single greatest political leader of our time. \u201d He followed up this week by declaring that McCain \u201c never forgot that political opponents are not his enemies , and that there are things more important than winning elections . \u201d\nEven those who view McCain in iconic terms would find that statement preposterous . The media loved McCain \u2019 s being accessible at their beck and call , his willingness to leak about his Senate colleagues , and his apostasy on key GOP positions ranging from campaign-finance reform to global warming and Obamacare . His failings were forgiven by the media during his 2000 presidential campaign , during which political columnist Joe Klein described him as \u201c a man on a white horse attempting to traverse a muddy field . \u201d\nDuring the 2000 Republican presidential convention in Philadelphia , I went to a tony restaurant to attend a reception .
