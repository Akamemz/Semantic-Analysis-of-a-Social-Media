Noting that DeSantis has \u201c received poor reviews \u201d and has \u201c resisted \u201d the \u201c calls from Democratic lawmakers \u201d to implement stricter measures , Cillizza noted Florida had 21 deaths . He did not note that at the time of publishing , Florida had just under one death per million people . Two of the other Gulf Coast states , Texas and Mississippi , also had under one death per million , and are both led by Republican governors .\nLouisiana had a dramatically higher rate of nearly 10 deaths per million people .
