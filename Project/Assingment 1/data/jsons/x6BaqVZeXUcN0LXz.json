This article was produced in partnership with New Mexico In Depth and The News & Observer of Raleigh , North Carolina . Both news organizations are members of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Local Reporting Network .\nOn Dec. 15 , 2016 , the nation \u2019 s largest nursing home lobby wrote a letter to Donald Trump , congratulating the president-elect and urging him to roll back new regulations on the long-term care industry .\nOne item on the wish list was a recently issued emergency preparedness rule . It required nursing homes to draw up plans for hazards such as an outbreak of a new infectious disease .\nTrump \u2019 s election , the American Health Care Association , or AHCA , wrote , had demonstrated that voters opposed \u201c extremely burdensome \u201d rules that endangered the industry \u2019 s thin profit margins .\n\u201c Part of the public \u2019 s message was asking for less Washington influence , less regulation , and more empowerment to the free market that has made our country the greatest in the world , \u201d AHCA wrote . \u201c We embrace that message and look forward to working with you to improve the lives of the residents in our facilities . \u201d\nThe letter was another salvo in the industry \u2019 s fight against regulations designed to stop diseases like COVID-19 from devastating elderly residents of the nation \u2019 s nursing homes , according to a review of documents and data by New Mexico In Depth ; The News & Observer of Raleigh , North Carolina ; and \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe lack of pandemic plans helps explain why nursing homes have been caught unprepared for the new coronavirus , patient advocates and industry observers said . Across the country , more than one in four nursing homes have registered an outbreak , according to media reports . More than 16,000 nursing home residents and workers have died , accounting for 17 % of COVID-19 deaths nationwide , according to an AARP tally on May 18 . That figure is likely an understatement of the true scope of the harm .\nOngoing questions about the regulations may also have played a role . The 2016 rules mandated planning for all kinds of hazards , citing Ebola as an example . In 2019 , the Trump administration clarified that nursing homes needed to include a specific plan for outbreaks of unfamiliar and contagious diseases \u2014 such as the coronavirus .\nThe plans must address how facilities will respond in an emergency \u2014 specifying how nursing homes will decide to shelter in place or evacuate and how they will provide residents with food , water , medicine and power . Nursing homes have to train their staff on these plans and practice them at least twice a year , if possible by participating in a drill with local agencies .\nSome nursing homes were slow to comply , according to an analysis of inspection data , watchdog reports and interviews with ombudsmen and advocates . Inspectors have found more than 24,000 deficiencies with nursing homes \u2019 emergency plans between November 2017 , when the so-called \u201c all hazards rule \u201d took effect , and March 2020 , according to public data reviewed by the news organizations . The violations occurred in 6,599 facilities , equal to about 43 % of the country \u2019 s nursing homes .\nBecause of how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tracks the data , it \u2019 s not possible to say exactly how many of the emergency planning violations related specifically to a failure to plan for an infectious disease outbreak . Failures to meet routine infection control standards were excluded from the analysis .\nBut nursing home advocates say that more detailed plans accounting for expected staff and equipment shortages would have likely resulted in fewer deaths and illnesses at nursing homes stricken by the coronavirus . The current rule requires nursing homes to make contingency staffing preparations , but it doesn \u2019 t require stockpiles of personal protective equipment , or PPE .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just a river of grief , and it could have been prevented , \u201d said Pat McGinnis , executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform .\nEmergency plans help facilities train their staff ahead of time and guide tough decisions during a crisis , said Ted Goins , the president and CEO of Lutheran Services Carolinas , a nonprofit based in Salisbury , North Carolina , that runs several highly rated elder-care facilities .\n\u201c COVID-19 is a perfect example of why we have emergency plans in our facilities , and I \u2019 m sure that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s a requirement , \u201d Goins said .\nAHCA declined to make any executives available for an interview . In a statement , the group said the pandemic shows that nursing homes should be a bigger priority for resources but not for regulation .\n\u201c As we assess the COVID-19 pandemic and how to prepare our healthcare system for future outbreaks , more regulation is not necessarily always the answer , \u201d AHCA said in the statement . \u201c There will be time to look back and determine what we can do better for future pandemics or crises . \u201d\nOne place to start : a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Albuquerque , New Mexico , with five deaths and 42 infections tied to a COVID-19 outbreak and no plan for dealing with a pandemic , according to its employees and New Mexico public records .\n\u201c Pandemic response ? I mean , I don \u2019 t think anybody was really prepared for a pandemic of this level or this quickly , \u201d said Edwardo Rivera , the facility \u2019 s administrator . \u201c We did have some things in place , but nothing could have prepared us for what COVID-19 was . \u201d\nRobert Potts , 91 , once flew America \u2019 s leaders around the globe .\nA retired Air Force colonel who flew combat missions in Korea and Vietnam , Potts returned to the United States to serve as pilot for Air Force One and Air Force Two in the 1960s , according to service records and a family member . He spoke of flying President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy .\nAfter he fell at home and hit his head in March , Potts wound up at Advanced Health Care of Albuquerque , part of a nationwide network of 22 post-hospitalization rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities .\nThe Albuquerque facility is a top-rated rehabilitation center with personal bedrooms and wine glasses in the dining hall . It takes care of patients needing physical , occupational or speech therapy after hospitalization .\nRead More How Safe Are Nursing Homes Near Me ? This Tool Will Help You Find Out . Nursing Home Inspect enables you to search through thousands of nursing home inspection reports to find problems and trends . Our latest update includes data on infection control violations , and notations for facilities that have had a coronavirus case .\nIn early April , AHC of Albuquerque staff and residents began testing positive for the coronavirus . Concerned about her father \u2019 s health , Potts \u2019 daughter Susan wanted to bring him home . Somebody from the facility \u2014 Susan could not remember exactly who \u2014 assured the family that Potts had tested negative for COVID-19 .\nWhen the AHC of Albuquerque van arrived at the Potts residence in the city \u2019 s affluent Northeast Heights on the afternoon of April 10 , the Potts family \u2019 s caretaker was there to greet him . Rosemary Ortiz , 57 , recalled that the driver reassured her that Potts was negative for COVID-19 .\nOrtiz , however , noticed that Potts had symptoms that corresponded with the disease : a runny nose and a dry cough . The next day , Saturday , those symptoms worsened . By Sunday morning , he complained of shortness of breath and chest pain . He was dizzy , Ortiz recalled .\nOrtiz drove him first to an urgent care facility , where he registered a temperature of 100 degrees . At a nurse \u2019 s recommendation , Ortiz drove Potts to Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Albuquerque .\n\u201c Wouldn \u2019 t it be something if I had the COVID and I gave it to you guys , to the family , \u201d she recalled him telling her .\nAt Presbyterian , Potts tested positive for COVID-19 . He was admitted to the fourth-floor ICU .\nOrtiz returned to her home that evening , a two-room casita in Albuquerque \u2019 s South Valley that she shares with a roommate .\nThe drive to ensure that nursing homes were better prepared for emergencies began amid disaster and disease .\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that nursing homes were unprepared for emergencies despite complying with existing federal standards . The watchdog recommended strengthening the federal requirements to be more specific about the elements that must be in a disaster plan and encourage more coordination with state and local emergency management officials .\nIn 2009 , the Government Accountability Office examined preparedness for a flu pandemic and recommended that the federal government do more to advise health care providers on emergency plans and monitor their performance . The shortcomings were underscored by an outbreak of swine flu that year , which sickened nursing home residents nationwide .\nIn 2013 , the concerns over infectious outbreaks began to take concrete form . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , or CMS , proposed updating the emergency preparedness requirements for all health care providers that participate in Medicare and Medicaid , including nursing homes .\n\u201c This was really something pretty basic , \u201d said Richard Mollot , the executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition , which advocates for nursing home residents and their families .\nBut nursing home operators didn \u2019 t see it that way . They objected to the new requirements , arguing they would be costly and burdensome . Over the next three years , they repeatedly voiced their concerns as CMS finalized the new rule .\n\u201c We are concerned that CMS has underestimated the amount of time , training and resources necessary to implement many of these requirements , \u201d Catholic Health Initiatives , which operates 40 long-term care , assisted-living and residential-living facilities , said in a formal response to the CMS proposal .\nThe Continuing Care Leadership Coalition , which represents nonprofit and public post-acute and long-term care providers in the New York metropolitan area , told CMS that the additional personnel and equipment \u2014 such as backup generators \u2014 needed to comply with the new regulations risked the economic stability of some of its members . \u201c We view the proposed changes as considerable from a financial standpoint , in excess of appropriate minimum standards to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs , and we expect they would necessitate significant staffing and operational enhancements , \u201d the organization said .\nCMS rejected the appeals , issuing its final rules in September 2016 . Nursing homes and other facilities had one year to implement the changes .\nA few months later , AHCA sent its letter to Trump . The group followed up by asking Tom Price , Trump \u2019 s first HHS secretary , to stop implementing the new requirements and write a new rule . \u201c We are happy to work with your team and CMS staff to provide more specific suggestions , \u201d the industry group said .\nThe following year , the Trump administration proposed fulfilling some of AHCA \u2019 s wishes . The organization had warned that creating and updating the plans risked taking time away from patients .\nAdvocates for nursing home residents objected that CMS was contradicting its own conclusions . Public health officials said a rollback would undo potentially life-saving improvements .\nCMS ultimately decided to remove the mandate for nursing homes to document coordination with local authorities .\nBut the agency remained insistent on the need to plan for pandemics and other outbreaks of new diseases : \u201c CMS determined it was critical for facilities to include planning for infectious diseases within their emergency preparedness program , \u201d it said in a memorandum issued in February 2019 .\nA resident at the Life Care Center of Kirkland in Washington on March 16 . The home became one of the first reported outbreaks of the virus in the United States . ( Grant Hindsley/The New York Times via Redux )\nOn March 10 , just a day before authorities announced New Mexico \u2019 s first positive COVID-19 case , Kate Brennan was listening to sports radio on her way to work at AHC of Albuquerque , located in a neighborhood of industrial and business parks . The most senior physical therapist at the facility , she listened with alarm to news about the spread of the coronavirus .\nShe pulled into the parking lot at the same time as Edwardo Rivera , the top administrator . What were they going to do to protect patients and staff from a COVID-19 outbreak , she asked .\n\u201c Katie , it \u2019 s nothing more than the flu . It \u2019 s not a big deal , \u201d she said he told her .\nRivera said he could not recall making such a statement . But on March 13 , CMS issued new COVID-19 measures for nursing homes nationwide . The agency recommended the screening of residents and staff for fever and respiratory symptoms , restricting \u201c all visitors , effective immediately , \u201d except for end-of-life visits , and canceling all group activities and communal dining .\nThe measures appeared to catch Rivera and his management team by surprise . Their response over the next several weeks was confused and uncertain , employees and patients \u2019 family members said .\nBy March 15 , AHC of Albuquerque announced a halt to family visits . Staff and contractors were checked at the facility door for fever . But group therapy in the gym did not immediately stop , according to former employees who were there at the time . Patients were given the option of eating meals in their own rooms , according to an employee \u2019 s cellphone text , but meals in the facility \u2019 s dining room continued .\nBrennan grew increasingly worried that AHC was not adequately preparing . Despite the CMS regulations , Brennan and several others said they had never received any kind of training on how to handle an epidemic .\n\u201c We never talked about COVID-19 training , I know that . Never . Never , \u201d Brennan said .\nNurse Carole J. Welch agreed , as did two other AHC of Albuquerque employees interviewed on the condition that they remain anonymous . Fire drills were the only disaster planning and exercises about which Welch and Brennan were aware , they said .\n\u201c There was never anything mentioned about COVID-19 , \u201d Welch said . \u201c At all-staff meetings , everybody signs a sign-in sheet . If state inspectors ever ask them for documentation for in-service training or sign-in sheets for COVID-19 trainings , unless they \u2019 ve made them up , there aren \u2019 t any . \u201d\nNor did the facility participate in any community drills or exercises in recent years other than fire drills , Welch and Brennan agreed .\nRivera said several COVID-19 training sessions had been held since early January . Asked if AHC of Albuquerque had conducted staff training to prepare for the pandemic \u2014 explaining how the coronavirus can be transmitted and what precautions are needed to avoid its spread \u2014 Rivera said they \u2019 d been doing such training \u201c for a while now , \u201d a claim vociferously denied by staff .\nIn March , the New Mexico Department of Health rushed inspectors to AHC of Albuquerque as part of a statewide effort to review facilities \u2019 emergency response plans in anticipation of the coronavirus pandemic . No deficiencies were noted in either planning or training . Health Department officials did not respond to questions about whether inspectors specifically examined the pandemic response portion of the facility \u2019 s emergency plan .\nBut Rivera acknowledged that AHC had no pandemic response plan , as federal rules require , just a more general disaster response plan . He noted he had not coordinated with local health officials to plan or drill for an epidemic to identify potential problems .\n\u201c We did not coordinate much when it comes to an epidemic of this fashion with the [ state ] Department of Health , \u201d Rivera said . \u201c They did review all of our policy procedures and emergency preparedness plan and everything was checked off and OK \u2019 d . But there was never any official training with the Department of Health . \u201d\nWhen asked directly whether AHC of Albuquerque had a generic emergency plan rather than one specific to the needs of a pandemic ( such as infection control and PPE supplies ) , Rivera said : \u201c Correct . \u201d\nTo Brennan , Rivera \u2019 s attitude was too lax for the situation facing the facility \u2019 s patients and residents . She believed the lack of guidance was putting her and her patients at risk .\nBrennan said she would not work with patients without appropriate PPE and announced she was taking personal leave on March 16 . She was fired . Welch asked to be changed from full time to an on-call nurse on April 5 because of similar concerns as Brennan \u2019 s . She later learned she , too , had been fired .\n\u201c I think in 2 weeks we will see a lot occur \u2026 and perhaps our standards will rise \u2026 or won \u2019 t need to , \u201d Brennan texted to a supervisor . \u201c But in the meantime , I felt we should do more , be more . \u201d\nA memorial in front of Louisburg Healthcare and Rehabilitation in North Carolina , where 56 residents caught the virus and 19 died . ( Robert Willett/The News & Observer )\nAHC of Albuquerque \u2019 s failure to create a pandemic plan is not unique among nursing homes . A 2018 report by Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee concluded that nursing homes are still unprepared even for more common emergencies like hurricanes .\nWhile some homes have devoted a lot of energy to protecting their residents from disasters , many facilities are doing the bare minimum , according to David Grabowski , a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s ever been a major area of focus , \u201d Grabowski said , \u201c somewhat because CMS hasn \u2019 t forced this and really held their feet to the fire . \u201d\nThe inspectors who verify whether a nursing home meets emergency preparedness standards are supposed to read the plan to make sure it \u2019 s updated and \u201c encompasses potential hazards. \u201d They should also confirm that the nursing home has been training its employees on the emergency plan and ensure that the facility has made preparations for communicating and delegating authority in a crisis .\nThe most commonly cited problem for nursing homes \u2019 emergency preparedness is failing to rehearse their plans in a community drill , usually organized by local emergency management or a hospital-led health care coalition .\nSince inspectors are tasked with identifying immediate hazards , they may be less focused on scrutinizing emergency plans , said Eric Carlson , directing attorney of Justice in Aging , which advocates for impoverished seniors .\nIn 2019 and 2020 , the HHS inspector general found that inspectors in at least five states \u2014 California , New York , Florida , Texas and Missouri \u2014 were not thoroughly policing the new emergency preparedness rule . CMS has said it will expand its oversight of states \u2019 enforcement .\nAnother indication of underenforcement is how much violations vary across the country . Advocates and experts say the variation more likely reflects different states \u2019 inspection priorities rather than how much facilities are actually doing .\nCalifornia has one of the highest citation rates , with inspectors finding more than three emergency-preparedness violations per facility since November 2017 , according to the analysis . At least 56 facilities have been cited for failing to plan for potential pandemics .\nWarning notices at Cedar Mountain Post Acute , a nursing facility in Yucaipa , California , that was cited for lacking a pandemic plan . There have been 21 deaths linked to the facility by San Bernardino County . ( Chris Carlson/AP Photo )\nNew Mexico cited nursing homes for emergency-preparedness deficiencies at about the same rate , but it \u2019 s not possible to say how many of those deficiencies related specifically to failing to plan for confronting a new infectious disease . Today , nursing homes account for 31 % of all COVID-19 deaths in New Mexico .\nThe citation rate in New York , where more than 5,800 nursing home residents died with confirmed or presumed infections , was much lower , roughly one deficiency per nursing home .\nNorth Carolina registered few deficiencies . Although the state has more than 400 nursing homes , its inspectors issued just 44 emergency-preparedness citations to 40 facilities , none related to a nursing home \u2019 s failure to prepare for an epidemic .\nDespite this apparently clean record , North Carolina \u2019 s nursing homes have been ravaged by COVID-19 . Nursing home residents make up more than half of the state \u2019 s deaths . About 20 % of facilities have had outbreaks , and some have been unable to stop the virus \u2019 s spread before virtually every resident was infected .\nAt Louisburg Healthcare and Rehabilitation , all but five of the facility \u2019 s 61 residents caught the virus and 19 died . Despite the federal directive to coordinate with local emergency managers , the nursing home didn \u2019 t submit its plan for review .\nJeff Bright , the emergency manager of Franklin County , where the nursing home is located , said the first time he talked to the facility \u2019 s administrator was after the outbreak began . \u201c The initial conversation was , \u2018 Oh good gracious , we \u2019 re overwhelmed , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nIn a statement , the nursing home \u2019 s management company , Liberty Healthcare , acknowledged that local emergency officials had not reviewed the facility \u2019 s emergency plan . But the company said its plan contained a section on pandemic influenza response that proved helpful . State inspectors have reviewed the nursing home \u2019 s emergency plan three times since the new rule took effect , the company noted , and each time the facility was found in compliance .\nRegulators should do more to make sure that nursing homes and local emergency officials work together , advocates said .\n\u201c Facilities should have been better prepared for this , \u201d Melanie McNeil , Georgia \u2019 s long-term care ombudsman , said . \u201c The cost is human lives . That \u2019 s the cost of not being prepared . We know that people in long-term care are vulnerable . \u201d\nBrennan \u2019 s concerns proved prescient on April 3 \u2014 the 13th day at AHC of Albuquerque for an elderly Navajo patient in Room 222 .\nThat day , the man had coughing fits in the dining room and therapy gym , according to current and former employees . The next day , on Saturday , he was still coughing and had a fever , so staff quarantined him in his room and administered a nasal swab to test for COVID-19 .\nWord of his positive test result came the following day , April 5 \u2014 Palm Sunday . He was the first person known to have become infected at the facility .\nThat morning , the facility \u2019 s nursing director told staff to assign only one certified nursing assistant , or CNA , to enter the patient \u2019 s room , Welch said . But the CNA working in Room 222 was not told to avoid contact with other patients to avoid the risk of spreading the coronavirus , according to Welch . Several people who the CNA attended were later diagnosed with COVID-19 .\nRivera said the CNA took necessary precautions , including the use of personal protective equipment . But employees present at the facility on April 5 said the CNA was wearing a surgical mask , not one of the more protective N95 masks .\nRivera acknowledged that staff likely played a role in spreading the virus by mid-April .\nRead More 100,000 Lives Lost to COVID-19 . What Did They Teach Us ? Each person who has died of COVID-19 was somebody \u2019 s everything . Even as we mourn for those we knew , cry for those we loved and consider those who have died uncounted , the full tragedy of the pandemic hinges on one question : How do we stop the next 100,000 ?\n\u201c I would say it was indirect \u201d spread between residents by staff , Rivera said . \u201c At that time , we had all of our patients , remember , in isolation at that time , in their rooms . \u201d\nBetween April 5 and May 8 , 42 people \u2014 18 patients and 24 staff \u2014 at AHC of Albuquerque would test positive for the disease , according to the state Health Department . Patients were sent home or to other nearby facilities like The Watermark assisted living center and the Canyon Transitional Rehabilitation Center , but only after testing negative twice , Rivera said .\nFive residents died , including two men and two women in their 70s and 80s , and Roslyn K. Pulitzer , 90 , a distant relative of the newspaper family who created the Pulitzer Prize , the nation \u2019 s highest journalistic honor .\nPulitzer , a psychotherapist and fine arts photographer , drew her final breath holding the ungloved hand of Kay Lockridge , her partner of 36 years , at 8:45 a.m. on Thursday , April 30 , at the University of New Mexico Hospital \u2019 s intensive care unit .\n\u201c If we had known they had a case , Roz wouldn \u2019 t have gone there , \u201d said Lockridge , a journalist . \u201c I wish we \u2019 d known . \u201d\nAHC of Albuquerque had a history of problems with containing infectious outbreaks , according to employees and a review of state Health Department inspection reports dated 2009 to 2020 .\nThere have been recurring infections involving Clostridium difficile , commonly called C. diff , according to current and former AHC of Albuquerque employees and state inspection reports . C. diff is a drug-resistant bacterium that causes diarrhea and potentially lethal gut inflammation . Rivera said the facility has had no C. diff cases in 2020 . He did not return calls regarding previous outbreaks .\nRepeated problems with C. diff are a red flag for infection control problems , said Dusti Harvey , an Albuquerque attorney who previously worked for Sun Healthcare Group , a long-term nursing and post-hospitalization rehabilitation company .\nFederal regulations for nursing homes , including those for infection control , have been in place since 1989 , Harvey noted .\n\u201c This is something that nursing homes should have been doing for the last 30 years , \u201d Harvey said . \u201c Nursing homes should have been set up for COVID-19 way before it happened . \u201d\nAHC of Albuquerque was also short-staffed , according to employees . Changes in billing for physical therapy had led to layoffs in September 2019 . The facility had also begun to accept older , more fragile patients .\nThe situation was a \u201c perfect storm for things to go awry with the introduction of COVID-19 into the facility , \u201d Brennan said . \u201c Less staff , less cohesion , less communication , less direction . They brought in more patients that were inappropriate for effective group therapy due to their numerous medical issues . \u201d\nRivera insisted the changes to Medicare payments did not affect patient demographics and that staffing was not a problem .\nA final concern for some employees was Dr. Ralph S. Hansen , the facility \u2019 s medical director and one of its two designated infection control specialists . Neither Hansen nor the other designated specialist , a nurse , have a current credential in infectious disease management , according to records from the American Board of Medical Specialties and the New Mexico Board of Nursing .\n\u201c Dr . Hansen has an infectious disease background , \u201d Rivera said . But Hansen had not conducted any staff training , he acknowledged .\nCurrent and former workers described Hansen as \u201c disengaged \u201d and \u201c disconnected. \u201d Patients \u2019 missed doses of antibiotics and delayed lab results went unpursued .\nHansen was fired by a medical group in California and subsequently surrendered his California medical license after he allegedly stole other physicians \u2019 prescription pads and self-prescribed Ritalin under his own and fictitious names 326 times between 2004 and 2007 , California Medical Board records show . He was charged in 2007 with 15 felony counts of burglary , forgery and obtaining controlled substances by fraud , the records show . In a November 2007 plea bargain , he admitted only to obtaining a controlled substance by fraud .\nBut the following year , he moved to New Mexico , where he was issued a conditional medical license in March 2009 requiring monitored drug-abuse treatment and quarterly self-reports on his compliance with treatment , board records show . He went to work for the state prison in Los Lunas and the state Health Department . In 2014 , the New Mexico Medical Board granted Hansen an unrestricted medical license , records show . He stopped working for the state in October 2015 .\nBy May 7 , the COVID-19 outbreak at AHC of Albuquerque had peaked and largely resolved , Rivera said . As of Monday , May 11 , the facility had only five patients who tested positive .\nRivera did not return recent phone calls seeking updated figures .\nAt least two other people might be uncounted victims of the outbreak at AHC of Albuquerque .\nAfter Rosemary Ortiz dropped off Robert Potts at the hospital , she drove back to her own home , the two-room casita where she has lived since childhood .\nThe following week , Ortiz developed a cough and shortness of breath . She soon became dizzy and feverish , with terrible headaches . Despite the small size of her home , she had trouble walking to the front door .\n\u201c I was so sick I thought I was not going to see my kids or my mother ever again , \u201d she said . \u201c I thought I was going to die . \u201d\nAt home , Ortiz had kept her distance from her roommate , fearful of infecting her . But then she heard the woman coughing .\nReached by phone , Ortiz stopped to catch her breath and announced that she had been weeding her yard , back on her feet . As of Tuesday , May 26 , she had still tested positive for the coronavirus , even though she felt better .\nOrtiz had learned that Potts had been transferred to the Canyon Transitional facility for hospice care after several weeks at Presbyterian hospital . Ortiz said Potts \u2019 health has improved and he may be released to go home in a few weeks .\n\u201c I miss him . I miss Mr. Potts very much , \u201d she said .\nBryant Furlow is a reporter for New Mexico In Depth . Carli Brosseau is a reporter for The News & Observer of Raleigh , North Carolina .

This article was produced in partnership with New Mexico In Depth and The News & Observer of Raleigh, North Carolina. Both news organizations are members of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2016, the nation\u2019s largest nursing home lobby wrote a letter to Donald Trump, congratulating the president-elect and urging him to roll back new regulations on the long-term care industry.\n\nOne item on the wish list was a recently issued emergency preparedness rule. It required nursing homes to draw up plans for hazards such as an outbreak of a new infectious disease.\n\nTrump\u2019s election, the American Health Care Association, or AHCA, wrote, had demonstrated that voters opposed \u201cextremely burdensome\u201d rules that endangered the industry\u2019s thin profit margins.\n\n\u201cPart of the public\u2019s message was asking for less Washington influence, less regulation, and more empowerment to the free market that has made our country the greatest in the world,\u201d AHCA wrote. \u201cWe embrace that message and look forward to working with you to improve the lives of the residents in our facilities.\u201d\n\nHelp Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\nThe letter was another salvo in the industry\u2019s fight against regulations designed to stop diseases like COVID-19 from devastating elderly residents of the nation\u2019s nursing homes, according to a review of documents and data by New Mexico In Depth; The News & Observer of Raleigh, North Carolina; and ProPublica.\n\nThe lack of pandemic plans helps explain why nursing homes have been caught unprepared for the new coronavirus, patient advocates and industry observers said. Across the country, more than one in four nursing homes have registered an outbreak, according to media reports. More than 16,000 nursing home residents and workers have died, accounting for 17% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, according to an AARP tally on May 18. That figure is likely an understatement of the true scope of the harm.\n\nOngoing questions about the regulations may also have played a role. The 2016 rules mandated planning for all kinds of hazards, citing Ebola as an example. In 2019, the Trump administration clarified that nursing homes needed to include a specific plan for outbreaks of unfamiliar and contagious diseases \u2014 such as the coronavirus.\n\nThe plans must address how facilities will respond in an emergency \u2014 specifying how nursing homes will decide to shelter in place or evacuate and how they will provide residents with food, water, medicine and power. Nursing homes have to train their staff on these plans and practice them at least twice a year, if possible by participating in a drill with local agencies.\n\nSome nursing homes were slow to comply, according to an analysis of inspection data, watchdog reports and interviews with ombudsmen and advocates. Inspectors have found more than 24,000 deficiencies with nursing homes\u2019 emergency plans between November 2017, when the so-called \u201call hazards rule\u201d took effect, and March 2020, according to public data reviewed by the news organizations. The violations occurred in 6,599 facilities, equal to about 43% of the country\u2019s nursing homes.\n\nBecause of how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tracks the data, it\u2019s not possible to say exactly how many of the emergency planning violations related specifically to a failure to plan for an infectious disease outbreak. Failures to meet routine infection control standards were excluded from the analysis.\n\nBut nursing home advocates say that more detailed plans accounting for expected staff and equipment shortages would have likely resulted in fewer deaths and illnesses at nursing homes stricken by the coronavirus. The current rule requires nursing homes to make contingency staffing preparations, but it doesn\u2019t require stockpiles of personal protective equipment, or PPE.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a river of grief, and it could have been prevented,\u201d said Pat McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.\n\nEmergency plans help facilities train their staff ahead of time and guide tough decisions during a crisis, said Ted Goins, the president and CEO of Lutheran Services Carolinas, a nonprofit based in Salisbury, North Carolina, that runs several highly rated elder-care facilities.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is a perfect example of why we have emergency plans in our facilities, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why it\u2019s a requirement,\u201d Goins said.\n\nAHCA declined to make any executives available for an interview. In a statement, the group said the pandemic shows that nursing homes should be a bigger priority for resources but not for regulation.\n\n\u201cAs we assess the COVID-19 pandemic and how to prepare our healthcare system for future outbreaks, more regulation is not necessarily always the answer,\u201d AHCA said in the statement. \u201cThere will be time to look back and determine what we can do better for future pandemics or crises.\u201d\n\nOne place to start: a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with five deaths and 42 infections tied to a COVID-19 outbreak and no plan for dealing with a pandemic, according to its employees and New Mexico public records.\n\n\u201cPandemic response? I mean, I don\u2019t think anybody was really prepared for a pandemic of this level or this quickly,\u201d said Edwardo Rivera, the facility\u2019s administrator. \u201cWe did have some things in place, but nothing could have prepared us for what COVID-19 was.\u201d\n\nAn Emergency Call\n\nRobert Potts, 91, once flew America\u2019s leaders around the globe.\n\nA retired Air Force colonel who flew combat missions in Korea and Vietnam, Potts returned to the United States to serve as pilot for Air Force One and Air Force Two in the 1960s, according to service records and a family member. He spoke of flying President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nAfter he fell at home and hit his head in March, Potts wound up at Advanced Health Care of Albuquerque, part of a nationwide network of 22 post-hospitalization rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe Albuquerque facility is a top-rated rehabilitation center with personal bedrooms and wine glasses in the dining hall. It takes care of patients needing physical, occupational or speech therapy after hospitalization.\n\nRead More How Safe Are Nursing Homes Near Me? This Tool Will Help You Find Out.

Our latest update includes data on infection control violations, and notations for facilities that have had a coronavirus case.\n\nIn early April, AHC of Albuquerque staff and residents began testing positive for the coronavirus. Concerned about her father\u2019s health, Potts\u2019 daughter Susan wanted to bring him home. Somebody from the facility \u2014 Susan could not remember exactly who \u2014 assured the family that Potts had tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nWhen the AHC of Albuquerque van arrived at the Potts residence in the city\u2019s affluent Northeast Heights on the afternoon of April 10, the Potts family\u2019s caretaker was there to greet him. Rosemary Ortiz, 57, recalled that the driver reassured her that Potts was negative for COVID-19.\n\nOrtiz, however, noticed that Potts had symptoms that corresponded with the disease: a runny nose and a dry cough. The next day, Saturday, those symptoms worsened. By Sunday morning, he complained of shortness of breath and chest pain. He was dizzy, Ortiz recalled.\n\nOrtiz drove him first to an urgent care facility, where he registered a temperature of 100 degrees. At a nurse\u2019s recommendation, Ortiz drove Potts to Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Albuquerque.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be something if I had the COVID and I gave it to you guys, to the family,\u201d she recalled him telling her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that, we don\u2019t want that!\u201d Ortiz responded.\n\nAt Presbyterian, Potts tested positive for COVID-19. He was admitted to the fourth-floor ICU.\n\nOrtiz returned to her home that evening, a two-room casita in Albuquerque\u2019s South Valley that she shares with a roommate.\n\nShe worried that Potts was dying.\n\nSomething Pretty Basic\n\nThe drive to ensure that nursing homes were better prepared for emergencies began amid disaster and disease.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that nursing homes were unprepared for emergencies despite complying with existing federal standards. The watchdog recommended strengthening the federal requirements to be more specific about the elements that must be in a disaster plan and encourage more coordination with state and local emergency management officials.\n\nIn 2009, the Government Accountability Office examined preparedness for a flu pandemic and recommended that the federal government do more to advise health care providers on emergency plans and monitor their performance. The shortcomings were underscored by an outbreak of swine flu that year, which sickened nursing home residents nationwide.\n\nAmbulances line up to take patients from the Magnolia Rehabilitation and Nursing Center. (Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2013, the concerns over infectious outbreaks began to take concrete form. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, proposed updating the emergency preparedness requirements for all health care providers that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, including nursing homes.\n\n\u201cThis was really something pretty basic,\u201d said Richard Mollot, the executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, which advocates for nursing home residents and their families.\n\nBut nursing home operators didn\u2019t see it that way. They objected to the new requirements, arguing they would be costly and burdensome. Over the next three years, they repeatedly voiced their concerns as CMS finalized the new rule.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that CMS has underestimated the amount of time, training and resources necessary to implement many of these requirements,\u201d Catholic Health Initiatives, which operates 40 long-term care, assisted-living and residential-living facilities, said in a formal response to the CMS proposal.\n\nThe Continuing Care Leadership Coalition, which represents nonprofit and public post-acute and long-term care providers in the New York metropolitan area, told CMS that the additional personnel and equipment \u2014 such as backup generators \u2014 needed to comply with the new regulations risked the economic stability of some of its members. \u201cWe view the proposed changes as considerable from a financial standpoint, in excess of appropriate minimum standards to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and we expect they would necessitate significant staffing and operational enhancements,\u201d the organization said.\n\nCMS rejected the appeals, issuing its final rules in September 2016. Nursing homes and other facilities had one year to implement the changes.\n\nA few months later, AHCA sent its letter to Trump. The group followed up by asking Tom Price, Trump\u2019s first HHS secretary, to stop implementing the new requirements and write a new rule. \u201cWe are happy to work with your team and CMS staff to provide more specific suggestions,\u201d the industry group said.\n\nThe following year, the Trump administration proposed fulfilling some of AHCA\u2019s wishes. The organization had warned that creating and updating the plans risked taking time away from patients.\n\nAdvocates for nursing home residents objected that CMS was contradicting its own conclusions. Public health officials said a rollback would undo potentially life-saving improvements.\n\nCMS ultimately decided to remove the mandate for nursing homes to document coordination with local authorities.\n\nBut the agency remained insistent on the need to plan for pandemics and other outbreaks of new diseases: \u201cCMS determined it was critical for facilities to include planning for infectious diseases within their emergency preparedness program,\u201d it said in a memorandum issued in February 2019.\n\nA resident at the Life Care Center of Kirkland in Washington on March 16.

(Grant Hindsley/The New York Times via Redux)\n\nA Confused Response\n\nOn March 10, just a day before authorities announced New Mexico\u2019s first positive COVID-19 case, Kate Brennan was listening to sports radio on her way to work at AHC of Albuquerque, located in a neighborhood of industrial and business parks. The most senior physical therapist at the facility, she listened with alarm to news about the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nShe pulled into the parking lot at the same time as Edwardo Rivera, the top administrator. What were they going to do to protect patients and staff from a COVID-19 outbreak, she asked.\n\n\u201cKatie, it\u2019s nothing more than the flu. It\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d she said he told her.\n\nRivera said he could not recall making such a statement. But on March 13, CMS issued new COVID-19 measures for nursing homes nationwide. The agency recommended the screening of residents and staff for fever and respiratory symptoms, restricting \u201call visitors, effective immediately,\u201d except for end-of-life visits, and canceling all group activities and communal dining.\n\nThe measures appeared to catch Rivera and his management team by surprise. Their response over the next several weeks was confused and uncertain, employees and patients\u2019 family members said.\n\nBy March 15, AHC of Albuquerque announced a halt to family visits. Staff and contractors were checked at the facility door for fever. But group therapy in the gym did not immediately stop, according to former employees who were there at the time. Patients were given the option of eating meals in their own rooms, according to an employee\u2019s cellphone text, but meals in the facility\u2019s dining room continued.\n\nBrennan grew increasingly worried that AHC was not adequately preparing. Despite the CMS regulations, Brennan and several others said they had never received any kind of training on how to handle an epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe never talked about COVID-19 training, I know that. Never. Never,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nNurse Carole J. Welch agreed, as did two other AHC of Albuquerque employees interviewed on the condition that they remain anonymous. Fire drills were the only disaster planning and exercises about which Welch and Brennan were aware, they said.\n\n\u201cThere was never anything mentioned about COVID-19,\u201d Welch said. \u201cAt all-staff meetings, everybody signs a sign-in sheet. If state inspectors ever ask them for documentation for in-service training or sign-in sheets for COVID-19 trainings, unless they\u2019ve made them up, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nNor did the facility participate in any community drills or exercises in recent years other than fire drills, Welch and Brennan agreed.\n\nRivera said several COVID-19 training sessions had been held since early January. Asked if AHC of Albuquerque had conducted staff training to prepare for the pandemic \u2014 explaining how the coronavirus can be transmitted and what precautions are needed to avoid its spread \u2014 Rivera said they\u2019d been doing such training \u201cfor a while now,\u201d a claim vociferously denied by staff.\n\nIn March, the New Mexico Department of Health rushed inspectors to AHC of Albuquerque as part of a statewide effort to review facilities\u2019 emergency response plans in anticipation of the coronavirus pandemic. No deficiencies were noted in either planning or training. Health Department officials did not respond to questions about whether inspectors specifically examined the pandemic response portion of the facility\u2019s emergency plan.\n\nBut Rivera acknowledged that AHC had no pandemic response plan, as federal rules require, just a more general disaster response plan. He noted he had not coordinated with local health officials to plan or drill for an epidemic to identify potential problems.\n\n\u201cWe did not coordinate much when it comes to an epidemic of this fashion with the [state] Department of Health,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThey did review all of our policy procedures and emergency preparedness plan and everything was checked off and OK\u2019d. But there was never any official training with the Department of Health.\u201d\n\nWhen asked directly whether AHC of Albuquerque had a generic emergency plan rather than one specific to the needs of a pandemic (such as infection control and PPE supplies), Rivera said: \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nTo Brennan, Rivera\u2019s attitude was too lax for the situation facing the facility\u2019s patients and residents. She believed the lack of guidance was putting her and her patients at risk.\n\nBrennan said she would not work with patients without appropriate PPE and announced she was taking personal leave on March 16. She was fired. Welch asked to be changed from full time to an on-call nurse on April 5 because of similar concerns as Brennan\u2019s. She later learned she, too, had been fired.\n\n\u201cI think in 2 weeks we will see a lot occur \u2026 and perhaps our standards will rise \u2026 or won\u2019t need to,\u201d Brennan texted to a supervisor. \u201cBut in the meantime, I felt we should do more, be more.\u201d\n\nRivera declined to comment on personnel matters.\n\n\u201cThe Cost Is Human Lives\u201d\n\nA memorial in front of Louisburg Healthcare and Rehabilitation in North Carolina, where 56 residents caught the virus and 19 died. (Robert Willett/The News & Observer)\n\nAHC of Albuquerque\u2019s failure to create a pandemic plan is not unique among nursing homes. A 2018 report by Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee concluded that nursing homes are still unprepared even for more common emergencies like hurricanes.\n\nWhile some homes have devoted a lot of energy to protecting their residents from disasters, many facilities are doing the bare minimum, according to David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been a major area of focus,\u201d Grabowski said, \u201csomewhat because CMS hasn\u2019t forced this and really held their feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nThe inspectors who verify whether a nursing home meets emergency preparedness standards are supposed to read the plan to make sure it\u2019s updated and \u201cencompasses potential hazards.\u201d They should also confirm that the nursing home has been training its employees on the emergency plan and ensure that the facility has made preparations for communicating and delegating authority in a crisis.\n\nThe most commonly cited problem for nursing homes\u2019 emergency preparedness is failing to rehearse their plans in a community drill, usually organized by local emergency management or a hospital-led health care coalition.\n\nSince inspectors are tasked with identifying immediate hazards, they may be less focused on scrutinizing emergency plans, said Eric Carlson, directing attorney of Justice in Aging, which advocates for impoverished seniors.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the HHS inspector general found that inspectors in at least five states \u2014 California, New York, Florida, Texas and Missouri \u2014 were not thoroughly policing the new emergency preparedness rule. CMS has said it will expand its oversight of states\u2019 enforcement.\n\nAnother indication of underenforcement is how much violations vary across the country. Advocates and experts say the variation more likely reflects different states\u2019 inspection priorities rather than how much facilities are actually doing.\n\nCalifornia has one of the highest citation rates, with inspectors finding more than three emergency-preparedness violations per facility since November 2017, according to the analysis. At least 56 facilities have been cited for failing to plan for potential pandemics.\n\nWarning notices at Cedar Mountain Post Acute, a nursing facility in Yucaipa, California, that was cited for lacking a pandemic plan. There have been 21 deaths linked to the facility by San Bernardino County. (Chris Carlson/AP Photo)\n\nNew Mexico cited nursing homes for emergency-preparedness deficiencies at about the same rate, but it\u2019s not possible to say how many of those deficiencies related specifically to failing to plan for confronting a new infectious disease. Today, nursing homes account for 31% of all COVID-19 deaths in New Mexico.\n\nThe citation rate in New York, where more than 5,800 nursing home residents died with confirmed or presumed infections, was much lower, roughly one deficiency per nursing home.\n\nNorth Carolina registered few deficiencies. Although the state has more than 400 nursing homes, its inspectors issued just 44 emergency-preparedness citations to 40 facilities, none related to a nursing home\u2019s failure to prepare for an epidemic.\n\nDespite this apparently clean record, North Carolina\u2019s nursing homes have been ravaged by COVID-19. Nursing home residents make up more than half of the state\u2019s deaths. About 20% of facilities have had outbreaks, and some have been unable to stop the virus\u2019s spread before virtually every resident was infected.\n\nAt Louisburg Healthcare and Rehabilitation, all but five of the facility\u2019s 61 residents caught the virus and 19 died. Despite the federal directive to coordinate with local emergency managers, the nursing home didn\u2019t submit its plan for review.\n\nJeff Bright, the emergency manager of Franklin County, where the nursing home is located, said the first time he talked to the facility\u2019s administrator was after the outbreak began. \u201cThe initial conversation was, \u2018Oh good gracious, we\u2019re overwhelmed,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, the nursing home\u2019s management company, Liberty Healthcare, acknowledged that local emergency officials had not reviewed the facility\u2019s emergency plan. But the company said its plan contained a section on pandemic influenza response that proved helpful. State inspectors have reviewed the nursing home\u2019s emergency plan three times since the new rule took effect, the company noted, and each time the facility was found in compliance.\n\nRegulators should do more to make sure that nursing homes and local emergency officials work together, advocates said.\n\n\u201cFacilities should have been better prepared for this,\u201d Melanie McNeil, Georgia\u2019s long-term care ombudsman, said. \u201cThe cost is human lives. That\u2019s the cost of not being prepared. We know that people in long-term care are vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe Outbreak Begins\n\nBrennan\u2019s concerns proved prescient on April 3 \u2014 the 13th day at AHC of Albuquerque for an elderly Navajo patient in Room 222.\n\nThat day, the man had coughing fits in the dining room and therapy gym, according to current and former employees. The next day, on Saturday, he was still coughing and had a fever, so staff quarantined him in his room and administered a nasal swab to test for COVID-19.\n\nWord of his positive test result came the following day, April 5 \u2014 Palm Sunday. He was the first person known to have become infected at the facility.\n\nThat morning, the facility\u2019s nursing director told staff to assign only one certified nursing assistant, or CNA, to enter the patient\u2019s room, Welch said. But the CNA working in Room 222 was not told to avoid contact with other patients to avoid the risk of spreading the coronavirus, according to Welch. Several people who the CNA attended were later diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nRivera said the CNA took necessary precautions, including the use of personal protective equipment. But employees present at the facility on April 5 said the CNA was wearing a surgical mask, not one of the more protective N95 masks.\n\nRivera acknowledged that staff likely played a role in spreading the virus by mid-April.\n\nRead More 100,000 Lives Lost to COVID-19. What Did They Teach Us? Each person who has died of COVID-19 was somebody\u2019s everything. Even as we mourn for those we knew, cry for those we loved and consider those who have died uncounted, the full tragedy of the pandemic hinges on one question: How do we stop the next 100,000?\n\n\u201cI would say it was indirect\u201d spread between residents by staff, Rivera said. \u201cAt that time, we had all of our patients, remember, in isolation at that time, in their rooms.\u201d\n\nBetween April 5 and May 8, 42 people \u2014 18 patients and 24 staff \u2014 at AHC of Albuquerque would test positive for the disease, according to the state Health Department. Patients were sent home or to other nearby facilities like The Watermark assisted living center and the Canyon Transitional Rehabilitation Center, but only after testing negative twice, Rivera said.\n\nFive residents died, including two men and two women in their 70s and 80s, and Roslyn K. Pulitzer, 90, a distant relative of the newspaper family who created the Pulitzer Prize, the nation\u2019s highest journalistic honor.\n\nPulitzer, a psychotherapist and fine arts photographer, drew her final breath holding the ungloved hand of Kay Lockridge, her partner of 36 years, at 8:45 a.m. on Thursday, April 30, at the University of New Mexico Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.\n\n\u201cIf we had known they had a case, Roz wouldn\u2019t have gone there,\u201d said Lockridge, a journalist. \u201cI wish we\u2019d known.\u201d\n\nOutbreaks, Staff Cuts and a Disengaged Doctor\n\nAHC of Albuquerque had a history of problems with containing infectious outbreaks, according to employees and a review of state Health Department inspection reports dated 2009 to 2020.\n\nThere have been recurring infections involving Clostridium difficile, commonly called C. diff, according to current and former AHC of Albuquerque employees and state inspection reports. C. diff is a drug-resistant bacterium that causes diarrhea and potentially lethal gut inflammation. Rivera said the facility has had no C. diff cases in 2020. He did not return calls regarding previous outbreaks.\n\nRepeated problems with C. diff are a red flag for infection control problems, said Dusti Harvey, an Albuquerque attorney who previously worked for Sun Healthcare Group, a long-term nursing and post-hospitalization rehabilitation company.\n\nFederal regulations for nursing homes, including those for infection control, have been in place since 1989, Harvey noted.\n\n\u201cThis is something that nursing homes should have been doing for the last 30 years,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cNursing homes should have been set up for COVID-19 way before it happened.\u201d\n\nAHC of Albuquerque was also short-staffed, according to employees. Changes in billing for physical therapy had led to layoffs in September 2019. The facility had also begun to accept older, more fragile patients.\n\nThe situation was a \u201cperfect storm for things to go awry with the introduction of COVID-19 into the facility,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cLess staff, less cohesion, less communication, less direction. They brought in more patients that were inappropriate for effective group therapy due to their numerous medical issues.\u201d\n\nRivera insisted the changes to Medicare payments did not affect patient demographics and that staffing was not a problem.\n\nA final concern for some employees was Dr. Ralph S. Hansen, the facility\u2019s medical director and one of its two designated infection control specialists. Neither Hansen nor the other designated specialist, a nurse, have a current credential in infectious disease management, according to records from the American Board of Medical Specialties and the New Mexico Board of Nursing.\n\n\u201cDr. Hansen has an infectious disease background,\u201d Rivera said. But Hansen had not conducted any staff training, he acknowledged.\n\nCurrent and former workers described Hansen as \u201cdisengaged\u201d and \u201cdisconnected.\u201d Patients\u2019 missed doses of antibiotics and delayed lab results went unpursued.\n\nHansen was fired by a medical group in California and subsequently surrendered his California medical license after he allegedly stole other physicians\u2019 prescription pads and self-prescribed Ritalin under his own and fictitious names 326 times between 2004 and 2007, California Medical Board records show. He was charged in 2007 with 15 felony counts of burglary, forgery and obtaining controlled substances by fraud, the records show. In a November 2007 plea bargain, he admitted only to obtaining a controlled substance by fraud.\n\nBut the following year, he moved to New Mexico, where he was issued a conditional medical license in March 2009 requiring monitored drug-abuse treatment and quarterly self-reports on his compliance with treatment, board records show. He went to work for the state prison in Los Lunas and the state Health Department. In 2014, the New Mexico Medical Board granted Hansen an unrestricted medical license, records show. He stopped working for the state in October 2015.\n\nHansen did not return repeated calls and messages.\n\nBy May 7, the COVID-19 outbreak at AHC of Albuquerque had peaked and largely resolved, Rivera said. As of Monday, May 11, the facility had only five patients who tested positive.\n\nRivera did not return recent phone calls seeking updated figures.\n\nUncounted Victims\n\nAt least two other people might be uncounted victims of the outbreak at AHC of Albuquerque.\n\nAfter Rosemary Ortiz dropped off Robert Potts at the hospital, she drove back to her own home, the two-room casita where she has lived since childhood.\n\nThe following week, Ortiz developed a cough and shortness of breath. She soon became dizzy and feverish, with terrible headaches. Despite the small size of her home, she had trouble walking to the front door.\n\nOrtiz tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI was so sick I thought I was not going to see my kids or my mother ever again,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d\n\nAt home, Ortiz had kept her distance from her roommate, fearful of infecting her. But then she heard the woman coughing.\n\nThe roommate, too, tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nReached by phone, Ortiz stopped to catch her breath and announced that she had been weeding her yard, back on her feet. As of Tuesday, May 26, she had still tested positive for the coronavirus, even though she felt better.\n\nInside, Ortiz\u2019s roommate was still sick and coughing.\n\n\u201cBut I think she\u2019s doing better,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nOrtiz had learned that Potts had been transferred to the Canyon Transitional facility for hospice care after several weeks at Presbyterian hospital. Ortiz said Potts\u2019 health has improved and he may be released to go home in a few weeks.\n\nOrtiz paused.\n\n\u201cI miss him. I miss Mr. Potts very much,\u201d she said.\n\nBryant Furlow is a reporter for New Mexico In Depth. Carli Brosseau is a reporter for The News & Observer of Raleigh, North Carolina.
