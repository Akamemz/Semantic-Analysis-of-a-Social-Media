As an example , in 2008 , Mark Halperin trashed John McCain in the first presidential debate as \u201c Cluttered , jumpy , and often muddled , \u201d while saying , \u201c His arguments were hard to follow. \u201d For that awful review , Halperin gave the Arizona senator a surprisingly high grade of \u201c B- \u201c . From that same debate , Halperin characterized Senator Obama \u2019 s appearance as \u201c Polished , confident , focused , \u201d while being \u201c immersed in the past , present , and future details of policy. \u201d Oddly , Halperin only gave Obama an \u201c A- \u201c grade for his performance that night .\nThe 2012 debate held more of the same kind of confusing misjudgment from the blind zebras of the media .

Like a fullback trying to burrow his way through a pile of defensive linemen , they clung to the narrative they \u2019 d already set , and drove the idea of Romney \u2019 s win into the history books . But facts matter . If the debate were a football game , a clear and honest call of that contest would have said that Obama won an extremely low scoring match , merely because he didn \u2019 t penalize himself into oblivion with lies like Romney .\nWhich brings us back to this weekend , the impending expectations game between Clinton and Trump , and the inability of the pandering pundits and the political zealots to admit the obvious .

As Greg Sargent noted on Thursday , Trump clearly is already warning Lester Holt , the debate moderator - along with the rest of the nation - that Trump won \u2019 t be held to things like real-time fact checks . Clinton \u2019 s camp did their own working of the refs recently , after Matt Lauer \u2019 s embarrassing impersonation of a journalist at the recent presidential town hall forum . The difference in how each side played the refs , as Sargent also noted , is that most Clinton supporters seem to want a fair playing field , where both candidates are judged by the same rules .\nThat , by the way , is exactly what every American who cares about the election should do Monday night : Apply the same set of rules to BOTH candidates , regardless of each one \u2019 s previous experience .
