Yes , those , the ones the Syrian regime agreed to give up after President Obama threatened to bomb .\nAll of the `` priority one '' the most dangerous of those weapons , were supposed to be gone by December 31 last year . They 're not . Almost all of them -- more than 95 % -- are still in Syria despite a commitment by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to get rid of his deadly arsenal .\nThe deal to remove Syria 's stock of WMD was the one tangible accomplishment of the Obama administration 's approach to the Middle East 's multiple crises . Now that deal looks to be failing , even as red flags also start flying along the path to a deal with Iran .\nIt 's hard to escape the impression that Iran and its close ally , Syria , are toying with the U.S .\nAmerica is earnestly seeking a diplomatic solution . And we should all hope diplomacy succeeds in securing an agreement that stops the carnage in Syria and one that prevents Iran from becoming a greater threat to its neighbors . But there is a reason these efforts are already running into trouble .\nSecretary of State John Kerry is valiantly pursuing the suit-and-tie approach to peace , but Kerry is handicapped by the growing perception that Obama will not use military force under any circumstances . The U.S. does n't need to release bombs to show it is powerful . What it needs to do is remind its adversaries , its enemies , that it has options beyond the well-appointed rooms of hotels along Lake Geneva .\nObama can do this by speaking directly and firmly about those choices . That alone would go a long way in reshaping some points of views , and could produce results . If it does n't , more concrete steps would be required , from increasing material support for specific anti-al-Assad forces to a tightening of sanctions against Iran and other steps .\nDiplomats can help concentrate the mind of their interlocutors when the people on the other side of the table worry about the possible cost of failure .\nThis is true of Syria 's al-Assad , who has heard Obama 's threats on the use of chemical weapons starting in the summer of 2012 , and is still playing games with America while relentlessly slaughtering and starving his people .\nAnd it is true about Iran , which just heard Obama during the State of the Union threaten to veto a plan to set the stage now for additional sanctions against Iran if negotiations fail in the next six months . Iranian officials presumably also heard the president state what so many have stopped believing : that he is prepared `` to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon . ''\nThe more we hear from the Iranians , the less likely it seems that a successful agreement can be reached .\nAfter CNN 's Fareed Zakaria talked to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last week , he concluded there 's a `` train wreck '' on its way in negotiations . The U.S. is moving forward on the assumption that a deal would involve the dismantling of some key nuclear facilities , but Rouhani , the moderate face of the Islamist Republic , made it `` categorically , specifically and unequivocally '' clear that Iran has no intention of ever rolling back its nuclear program .\nOn Syria , I had heard rumors that the removal of its most terrifying weapons was not going as scheduled . Then an anonymous source told Reuters that the regime has delivered a dismal 4.1 % of the 1,300 tons of toxic agents it has reported , `` and there is no sign of more , '' on the way .\nJUST WATCHED Playing for time with human lives Replay More Videos ...

'' In addition , he said , there is little progress on Syria 's commitment to destroy its chemical weapons production facilities .\nIf Syria 's games over its chemical weapons sound familiar -- agreements followed by `` misunderstandings '' and endless delays -- it is because we see much the same already unfolding with Iran .\nIran 's President and foreign minister are well versed in their communications strategy with the West .

And how great it would be to truly resolve the issue diplomatically .\nHope , however , is not a strategy any more than closing your eyes when you do n't like what you see , as when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted that in the Geneva agreement the `` world powers surrendered '' to Iran . That 's when the White House dismissed the worrisome statement as a play for a domestic audience .\nSince then , however , one after another Iranian official has maintained they have no intention of taking apart any of their nuclear program .
