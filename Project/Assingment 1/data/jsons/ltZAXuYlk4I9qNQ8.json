It was created by the New York-based ad agency Grey and is called \u201c We Believe. \u201d And what the century-old , multibillion-dollar razor company , owned by the health and personal care giant Procter & Gamble , purports to believe is this : Its longtime slogan , \u201c The Best a Man Can Get , \u201d is ripe for an update .\nIn the pre-Super Bowl ad \u2014 released three weeks before the Super Bowl , as part of the YouTube-era rat race to get advance write-ups and possibly a viral hit during peak-commercial-watching season \u2014 Gillette shows young boys bullying each other and beating each other up , older men touching women \u2019 s shoulders in business meetings , and suburban dads lined up at a never-ending row of charcoal grills saying , \u201c Boys will be boys , \u201d over and over while watching incidents of light violence .\nJoin the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Video Lab Go behind the scenes .
