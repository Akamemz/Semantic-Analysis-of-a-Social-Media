    "content": "Hillary is new and improved ! Take as directed . She is ready on video , but how about real life ?\nMost of us get only one chance to make a first impression . But Hillary Clinton gets as many chances as she wants .\nShe has invented herself almost as many times as Edison tried to invent the light bulb .\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing . America is a land of reinvention . Our forefathers and foremothers came here to build fresh , new lives , unfettered by the past .\nSo as Hillary now officially runs for president ( again ) , she is allowed to adopt a new persona ( again ) .\nNow , as \u201c Saturday Night Live \u201d deftly satirized over the weekend , she needs to be \u201c personal , \u201d \u201c intimate , \u201d \u201c natural \u201d and \u201c hilarious . \u201d\nAnd Hillary , as her campaign refers to her , was all of these things on Sunday . Not in real life , of course . But in a video . A video put together in advance and tweaked , massaged and edited for days and days .\nThat Hillary \u2019 s presidential announcement video could be mistaken for a drug commercial was no accident .\nAmericans want quick fixes : better schools , better jobs , better housing , a secure retirement , a level playing field , equal rights and equal opportunities for all .\n\u201c Everyday Americans need a champion , and I want to be that champion , \u201d Hillary says in the video , which features everyday Americans of all races , ethnicities , colors and creeds .\nMen hold hands and plan their marriages . A senior citizen grows tomatoes . Two brothers tell us in Spanish that they are starting a business . A factory worker looks forward to a new job .\n\u201c When families are strong , America is strong , \u201d Hillary tells us . \u201c So I \u2019 m hitting the road to earn your vote , because it \u2019 s your time . And I hope you \u2019 ll join me on this journey . \u201d\nAt the end , I expected to see a couple in separate bathtubs holding hands .\nOr maybe a blue pill with the voiceover : \u201c Hillary-D , take only as directed during your Democratic caucus or primary . Side effects may include increased prosperity , national security and unbridled joy . \u201d\nThe real ad was so good \u2014 which is to say deftly exploitative \u2014 it even had a moment of pure humor when a man says , \u201c But most importantly , we just want to teach our dog to quit eating the trash. \u201d ( Shot of dog eating the trash . )\nWell , not so fast there . Ads are not real life . They are how we wish real life to be .\nDuring the ad , Hillary is shown listening and nodding as ordinary voters talk to her . Which is the point . This time around , the campaign is not about Hillary . It is about us ! The American voter !\nHillary is merely our champion , and she desperately needs to hear our ideas , thoughts , positions and viewpoints so she can provide what we need .\nWhich is why she is going on a \u201c listening tour \u201d of key caucus and primary states . Listening tours are a shopworn idea and also a pretty cynical one . The candidate must pretend there are some things she does not know .\nWhat does Hillary not already know , however ? Hillary is ferociously well-briefed for every event . But how do you brief somebody to listen ?\nAnd \u201c humble \u201d can be hard to practice when you have spent your adult life being \u201c experienced . \u201d\nIf she was so ready to answer \u201c the 3 a.m. phone call \u201d and save the world eight years ago , what is she unprepared for now ?\nNo matter . Running for president is a performance , and this time Hillary is going to master the performance . People will talk to her , and she will nod and tell a scripted joke and that will get on local TV .\nAnd only then will she be ready to deliver the \u201c big \u201d speech , which is why she started her campaign on video and not in front of a real crowd of real people .\nHer campaign has worked enormously hard to lower expectations about Hillary \u2019 s ability to perform in person . She must learn and prepare , her handlers say .\nOh , puh-leeze . Gim me a break . Hillary Clinton had been making darn good \u201c big \u201d speeches for years . Remember her concession speech on June 7 , 2008 ?\n\u201c Although we weren \u2019 t able to shatter that highest , hardest glass ceiling this time , thanks to you , it \u2019 s got about 18 million cracks in it ! \u201d she told a roaring crowd at the National Building Museum in Washington . \u201c And the light is shining through like never before , filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time . \u201d\nWell , this is next time , and you know what ? The path is a lot easier . Not just because Hillary has kept in shape by knocking down quarter-million dollar speeches for the past two years .\nNo , this time the path is easier because for another Democrat to beat her in Iowa would take a miracle .\nMartin O \u2019 Malley or Jim Webb could catch fire there on a personal level . Iowans often admire scrappy candidates . But what they lack is what Barack Obama had in 2008 : millions and millions of dollars and an experienced campaign team that knew how to build the ground game that is essential to winning in Iowa \u2019 s arcane caucus process .\nThere are no absolute guarantees , however . And real listening is hard to learn .\nOn Jan. 26 , 2007 , Hillary began her previous listening tour in Iowa .\nAt a town meeting in a high school gym in Des Moines , a man , who identified himself as a Gulf War veteran , asked her if the surge of new troops to Iraq \u201c was going to be enough . \u201d\nInstead of answering , Hillary replied \u201c Thanks so much for your service \u201d and then talked about how she visits military hospitals and believes America needs to provide good medical care for its veterans .\nIn the one-hour town meeting , Hillary did not mention Iraq a single time . She mentioned ethanol twice .\nBut today the Iraq War is ancient history ( she hopes ) , and all she has to do is appear to be humble and hilarious , knowledgeable yet not all-knowing .\nLast time , before she went to that town hall meeting , she went to Democratic state headquarters to meet with party activists . When asked about the war there , she said : \u201c There are no do-overs in life . \u201d\nOh , but there are . There have to be . Hillary Clinton \u2019 s future depends on it .",
