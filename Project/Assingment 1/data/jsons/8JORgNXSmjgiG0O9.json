The answer should be obvious : Of course the Constitution does not require states to subsidize religious education\u2014to the contrary , it limits the government \u2019 s ability to finance religion . Yet the court \u2019 s conservative majority may be prepared to turn the First Amendment on its head , compelling states to underwrite the religious indoctrination of children .\nWednesday \u2019 s case , Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , demonstrates just how far the Supreme Court has shifted to the right in recent years . SCOTUS did not uphold vouchers for parochial schools until 2002 \u2019 s Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , a 5\u20134 decision that drew sharp dissents from the liberal justices . Zelman opened the door to \u201c indirect funding \u201d for religious education , which proliferated in its wake : Today , 29 states , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico provide either vouchers or tax credits that reimburse parents who send their children to sectarian institutions .\nMontana is one of those states , but it might not be for much longer . In 2015 , the legislature enacted a program that gave a tax credit of up to $ 150 to individuals who donate to scholarship organizations . These groups then use the donations to award scholarships to students who attend private schools , including religious ones . But the Montana constitution bars the state from using public funds to aid any school that is \u201c controlled in whole or in part by any church , sect , or denomination. \u201d In light of this provision , the Montana Supreme Court ruled the tax credit scheme unlawful in 2018 . Rather than limit state funding to secular schools , the court invalidated the entire program .\nThe plaintiffs in Espinoza , who are represented by the libertarian Institute for Justice , are parents who wanted scholarships to keep their children at a Christian school . They allege that the Montana Supreme Court violated the First Amendment \u2019 s free exercise clause by axing the scheme . But the plaintiffs have a problem . The core of their argument is that once states fund private schools , they have to include religious schools . Montana , however , can no longer fund any private schools , secular or sectarian . So , the plaintiffs make the broader claim that states can not stop funding all private schools to avoid giving money to religious ones .\nDuring arguments on Wednesday , the liberal justices were skeptical of all this . Because of the Montana Supreme Court \u2019 s decision , Justice Elena Kagan told the Institute for Justice \u2019 s Richard Komer , \u201c whether you go to a religious school or you go to a secular private school , you \u2019 re in the same boat. \u201d So \u201c there is no discrimination at this point going on , is there ? \u201d Komer claimed that the Montana Supreme Court itself discriminated against religious students by shooting down the tax credit program . Does that mean , Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered , that Montana has \u201c to keep the program alive ? \u201d Yes , Komer said : Once \u201c the state chose to give aid , \u201d it could not stop giving aid to refrain from helping parochial schools .\nThis claim is , to put it mildly , a stretch . There is some precedent for the idea that states can \u2019 t deny funding to religious institutions because they are religious . In 2017 \u2019 s Trinity Lutheran v. Comer , the court held that Missouri violated free exercise by refusing to let a church daycare center compete for a grant to resurface its playground . The exclusion of a church from a public benefit \u201c solely because it is a church , \u201d the court declared , \u201c is odious to our Constitution. \u201d But Trinity Lutheran was explicitly limited to \u201c express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing , \u201d and disclaimed any impact on \u201c religious uses of funding . \u201d\nEveryone agrees that religious schools , unlike the daycare center , will use taxpayer money to indoctrinate students . So Komer \u2019 s argument is pretty radical , a far cry from Trinity Lutheran . Just how radical ? In his brief , Komer wrote that a student may not be \u201c forced to choose between attending a school that accords with her beliefs or receiving thousands of dollars in government benefits. \u201d But doesn \u2019 t that mean states have to fund religious education in par with public education ? Komer \u2019 s claim would seem to give every child a First Amendment right to attend religious schools on the taxpayer \u2019 s dime .\nJustice Stephen Breyer raised this point with Jeffrey Wall , principal deputy solicitor general , who supported the plaintiffs . If a state spends $ 500 million on public education , Breyer asked , does it have to give the same amount to parochial schools ? Wall said no , but Breyer wasn \u2019 t satisfied . \u201c What , \u201d he asked , \u201c is the difference ? \u201d Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014who was remarkably perky given his side hustle presiding over the Senate \u2019 s impeachment trial\u2014had the same question . He asked Adam Unikowsky , who represents Montana , whether Komer \u2019 s theory \u201c leads to a situation where the funding that goes to public schools \u201d would \u201c have to go to religious schools , \u201d as well . Unikowsky wasn \u2019 t sure , but the chief seemed troubled by the possibility .\nPredictably , Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh went to bat for Montana \u2019 s religious families , framing them as victims of appalling discrimination . Kavanaugh told Unikowsky that \u201c grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics \u201d was the \u201c clear motivation \u201d for Montana \u2019 s ban on sectarian aid . But as Unikowsky told Kavanaugh , Montana \u2019 s ban was enacted in 1972 , not to burden religion but to protect it from state interference . Thirty-seven states have similar provisions in their constitutions , and school choice proponents assert that they were motivated by anti-Catholic bias . It \u2019 s true that Reconstruction-era nativists favored these provisions\u2014but so did advocates for universal education regardless of creed .\nAlito tried a different angle : Imagine if a state shut down a scholarship program because money was \u201c mostly going to blacks and we don \u2019 t like that. \u201d If that \u2019 s unconstitutional\u2014and it surely is\u2014isn \u2019 t it also unconstitutional to shut down a program because money went to religious schools ?\n\u201c We just don \u2019 t think that race and religion are identical for all constitutional reasons , \u201d Unikowsky said . \u201c Basically , what you \u2019 re saying , \u201d Alito snapped , is that \u201c the difference between this and race is : it \u2019 s permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion. \u201d Breyer jumped in to help : \u201c Yes , \u201d he said , \u201c race is different from religion . Why ? There is no establishment clause in regard to race . What is the establishment clause ? Well , it has something to do with not supporting religion . And there is nothing more religious , except perhaps for the service in the church itself , than religious education . \u201d\nHere , Breyer came the closest of any justice to acknowledging a foundational principle oddly obscured in this case : The Constitution mandates the separation of church and state for good reason . Stillwater Christian School , where the plaintiffs send their children , inculcates students with a theology-based anti-LGBTQ ideology . So do at least three other schools that participate in the scholarship program , as HuffPost reported on Thursday . One places \u201c homosexual and lesbian behavior \u201d in the same category as \u201c incest \u201d and \u201c bestiality \u201d while stating that no \u201c non-Christian \u201d or \u201c uncommitted Christian \u201d could teach there . Another expels students on the basis of \u201c lesbian , gay , bisexual and/or transgender conduct \u201d and requires employees \u201c to affirm that they have not and will not engage in such behaviors . \u201d\nChristian schools have a right to teach this ideology , and Christian parents have a right to send their children to these schools . But shouldn \u2019 t Montana taxpayers also have a right not to subsidize these teachings , which may violate their own religious beliefs or freedom of conscience ? Can \u2019 t state embrace the principles of the establishment clause by declining to compel residents to fund faiths that clash with their own beliefs ? If parents want their children to learn that same-sex intimacy is no different from bestiality , is everyone else obligated to help pay for those lessons ?\nThe fate of Espinoza lies , as usual , in Roberts \u2019 hands .
