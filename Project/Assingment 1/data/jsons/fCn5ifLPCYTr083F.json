    "content": "Several years ago , South Carolina had a problem : a shortage of skilled workers and no good way to train young people for the workforce . So at a time when apprenticeship programs were in decline in the U.S. , the state started a program called Apprenticeship Carolina .\n`` We were really , really squarely well-positioned at the bottom , '' says Brad Neese , the program 's director .\nFrom the beginning , South Carolina took apprenticeship beyond the building trades \u2014 that 's the traditional route for apprentices \u2014 to fields like nursing , pharmacy and IT . As the number of apprenticeship programs has fallen nationwide , it has taken off in South Carolina .\n`` When we started this back in 2007 , we only had 90 companies that had apprenticeship programs , '' Neese says . `` We 've hit 670 , which , by the way , we only had 777 apprentices in 2007 . And we 've now serviced nearly 11,000 apprentices . So it 's been a phenomenal growth . ''\nWhat 's the secret sauce ? A state tax credit for companies does n't hurt \u2014 but at $ 1,000 per year per apprentice for four years , it 's pretty modest . A big factor is Germany . Companies like BMW and Bosch have plants in the state and brought with them the German system of apprenticeships .\n`` I think that the German influence has been great , '' Neese says . `` But we also have seen that it 's just a process that makes sense .
