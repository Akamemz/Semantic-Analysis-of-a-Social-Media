Scott Walker 's stealth 2016 strategy\nMADISON , Wis. \u2014 He can \u2019 t use the Senate soapbox to rack up media hits and political points , like Rand Paul or Marco Rubio . He isn \u2019 t poised to run up the score in his reelection campaign as a show of strength heading into 2016 , as Chris Christie intends to do this November in New Jersey .\nBut Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker \u2019 s game plan for the next three years is quietly taking shape : Win reelection next year in this purple state without moderating a record that has won many hearts in the conservative base ; let the other GOP hopefuls get sullied by the mud pit of Congress and each other ; then pounce in 2015 .\nThat , in essence , is the outline of the likely presidential contender \u2019 s game plan that emerged from interviews with multiple people in his orbit .\nOperating in the shadows of the emerging GOP presidential field , Walker has been laying the groundwork for a 2016 campaign . His bid would aim to capitalize on his record as a committed social conservative who has taken on Democratic interests repeatedly in a Midwestern battleground state \u2014 and won .\nYou probably won \u2019 t catch him on the Sunday talk shows holding forth on immigration reform or facing off with senators over federal surveillance policy . But that suits Walker fine . He \u2019 d rather take care of business in Wisconsin and travel quietly to early voting states , raising money and building chits for a national bid .\nBut the first order of business for Walker is winning his third election in four years here \u2014 against a wealthy potential Democratic opponent who could spend millions of her fortune \u2014 without watering down his conservative bona fides . A Republican governor facing reelection in a 50-50 state like Wisconsin might be prone to try and make nice with Democrats , but Walker , who beat back a union-led recall attempt against him last year , isn \u2019 t going there .\nAnd while most independent analysts expect Walker to ultimately prevail , winning with 55 percent is probably his best-case scenario in a state that \u2019 s among the most polarized in the country . Independent analysts agree he \u2019 s likely to win , but the left vows , at the very least , to make the 45-year-old governor pay a political price .\n\u201c Gov . Walker is as well positioned as an incumbent governor in Wisconsin could be , considering the political climate , [ but ] he won \u2019 t have a cakewalk for a reelection , \u201d said Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul . \u201c The governor and his team will be focused on making sure this goes well . Nothing else will matter because nothing else can happen if this race doesn \u2019 t go well . \u201d\nThe strongest potential Democratic candidates , including former Sen. Russ Feingold and Rep. Ron Kind , passed on challenging Walker . Walker , who raised $ 3.5 million in the first half of the year , looks likely to face Madison school board member Mary Burke , a former state commerce secretary whose family owns Trek Bicycle .\n\u201c It \u2019 s because nobody wants to walk to the slaughterhouse , \u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , who led the state party when Walker won in 2010 . \u201c The Democrats are suffering from overplaying their hand on this recall . They promised their base and the Democratic Party the world . They delivered a dud . \u201d\nBut Democrats say this won \u2019 t be anything resembling a coronation . Party leaders plan to attack what they deem to be Walker \u2019 s failure to meet his promises to bolster the state economy and his thinly veiled ambition for higher office .\nWalker won by 7 percentage points in last June \u2019 s recall election . President Barack Obama then carried the Badger State in November by the same 53 percent to 46 percent margin , even with favorite son Paul Ryan on the ticket .\nBut despite that challenging playing field for Republicans , Walker turned down federal money to expand Medicaid , signed a bill requiring ultrasounds before abortions , expanded a voucher program over howls of protest from the teachers union and just signed a budget that cuts taxes by $ 651 million over the next two years .\nWhen it comes to weighing in on national issues , meanwhile , the career-long state and local politician is picking his spots carefully , letting his Washington , D.C. , counterparts take divisive stands .\nTake health care .
