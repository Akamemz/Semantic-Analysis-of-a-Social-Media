    "content": "In September , President Donald Trump ended nearly a year of controversial negotiations for a U.S. military pullout with the Taliban , as the talks were on the cusp of agreement . Last week , however , he announced during his first visit to the country that talks would resume . Whatever the U.S. presence remains from here , questions persist about one of the most ambitious nation-building efforts in the post-World War II era : Just how fragile is the change to Afghan society , and what has all that American taxpayer cash left behind ?\nBut there are contradictions in that progress . Infrastructure projects that were supposed to open doors have been tempered by corruption and mismanagement . And the U.S. presence and money did create a sense of dependency among Afghans .\nOnce-unthinkable strides have been made in women \u2019 s rights , education for girls , and the creation of a middle class with high expectations for a civil society .\nAmerican troops remain locked in the longest war in U.S. history . Over the course of 18 years in Afghanistan , the United States has spent billions of dollars on the war and to rebuild there . The cumulative effect of the U.S. presence does not reflect the fortune spent , but it has changed the nation .\nOn a crisp early winter day in late 2003 , Afghan President Hamid Karzai took a pair of scissors from a tray offered by a schoolgirl \u2013 she was dressed for the ceremonial occasion in a purple velvet brocade dress with a reddish orange headscarf \u2013 and cut a ribbon to officially inaugurate the resurfaced Kabul-Kandahar highway .\nOn hand was then-U.S . Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad , who recalled in his speech how President George W. Bush had phoned him every other day to push for the first layer of asphalt to be laid on this flagship nation-building enterprise before winter snows set in . Even today , local Afghans call this vital 300-mile stretch of highway the \u201c Mr . Bush Project . \u201d\n\u201c There were some problems that we pointed out , but they were ignored , because President Bush would say , \u2018 Before the snow falls , the black line should be connected to Kandahar , \u2019 \u201d recalls an Afghan engineer who worked on the project for an American company . \u201c The black line was the first priority ; the second actually was quality , \u201d the engineer says , noting how U.S. politics had driven the rebuilding timeline . \u201c But in the next year , too many problems came out ... because of the speed . They pushed too fast . \u201d\nAIJAZ RAHI/AP/FILE Then-President Hamid Karzai ( center , in brown robe ) inaugurates the Kabul-Kandahar highway in 2003 . The road was central to U.S. nation-building efforts but has been wracked by problems .\nThe highway was portrayed as the symbol of the American commitment to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war and after U.S. forces orchestrated the ousting of the archconservative Taliban and Al Qaeda in November 2001 , following the 9/11 attacks . Mr. Bush promised the United States would succeed as nation builders . He noted the history of military conflicts in Afghanistan was \u201c one of initial success followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure , \u201d but vowed in April 2002 that America was \u201c not going to repeat that mistake. \u201d It would instead create a nation \u201c free from this evil [ that ] is a better place in which to live . \u201d\nYet the Kabul-Kandahar highway is emblematic of how America \u2019 s immense ambition in Afghanistan has yielded a mixed result of victories and defeats . The cumulative effect of the U.S. presence here does not reflect the fortune spent , but it clearly has changed the nation \u2013 often for the better .\nDespite the ribbon-cutting fanfare , this highway would eventually be crushed under the heavy weight of traffic it was not designed to carry . It would split with micro-cracks caused by explosions of roadside bombs and blown-up bridges and culverts . Insecurity also restricted maintenance , as it would hobble the entire U.S. effort .\nIndeed , 18 years after they first arrived , U.S. troops remain locked in the longest war in American history , and the cost in blood and treasure has been high . More than 2,400 U.S. military personnel have died since 2001 . And in the first nine months of 2019 alone , the United Nations counts 2,563 Afghan civilians killed .\nThe Taliban insurgency now controls or has influence across more than half of Afghanistan and is advancing . Yet the price of reconstruction paid by the U.S. has now topped $ 132 billion \u2013 never mind the far higher cost of the war itself , which is at least six times greater , official figures show . By comparison , the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild 16 European countries after World War II took some $ 100 billion in today \u2019 s dollars .\nDespite the huge investment , Afghanistan \u2019 s streets are not paved with gold . There is little here , in fact , that looks like Western Europe : Poverty remains endemic , corruption is chronic , and much of the money poured into rebuilding has been lost , mismanaged , or spent on dubious projects . Persistent insecurity only highlights how the authority of the U.S.-backed government is diminishing .\nYet Afghans note that other , less quantifiable metrics of progress give more reason for optimism . Their nation and society have been irreversibly transformed by the American effort here . Once-unthinkable strides have been made in women \u2019 s rights , education for girls , and the creation of a middle class with high expectations for a civil society .\nThe U.S. presence and money , to be sure , did create a sense of dependency among Afghans . It enabled not only corruption , but also the \u201c thinking that somebody else is going to do your job for you : The Americans are going to come , they are going to build my army , they are going to fight the Taliban and Al Qaeda , they are going to fix my country , \u201d says Masood Karokhail , director of The Liaison Office , a Kabul-based group that facilitates peace and rebuilding .\nAt the same time , however , he says that efforts by the U.S. and other donors instilled an Afghan version of the American dream . Afghans now demand more political rights and to live better lives .\n\u201c Those thousands of workshops that happened across the country on women \u2019 s rights , on youth , freedom ... each of those have left something in our minds , \u201d says Mr. Karokhail . \u201c For a country that had been a very traditional , closed society , suddenly it was exploding not only with cash but also information . \u201d\nIn September , President Donald Trump ended nearly a year of controversial negotiations for a U.S. military pullout with the Taliban , as the talks were on the cusp of agreement . Last week , however , he announced during his first visit to the country that talks would resume . Whatever U.S. presence remains from here , questions persist about one of the most ambitious nation-building efforts in the post-World War II era : Just how fragile is the change to Afghan society , especially in Kabul and other urban centers , and what has all that American taxpayer cash left behind ?\nIn 2001 , Afghanistan was certainly a different place . The country was coming out of five years of austere Taliban rule that forbade women from working outside the home , forbade schooling for girls , and even forbade photographic images of a human face . Taliban checkpoints were strewn with confiscated videotapes and music CDs .\nAfghans describe their society then as a \u201c desert \u201d \u2013 hopeless and lost in time .\n\u201c Just the level of human flourishing since the arrival of American troops \u2013 you can actually talk about an influx of resources creating babies that don \u2019 t die , and kids that get educated , \u201d says Graeme Smith , an Afghanistan analyst for the International Crisis Group , a Brussels-based think tank .\nThe statistics charting such upward trends are impressive . But they are tempered by \u201c waste , fraud and abuse \u201d that U.S. auditors in 2017 said had tarnished 29 % of the $ 52.7 billion in spending they examined .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t rebuild it into a little America , \u201d John Sopko , the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction , whose office produces voluminous quarterly reports and audits for Congress , told The Hill , a U.S. political website , in June 2018 . \u201c I think that was one of the problems . We wanted to turn this into Kansas . \u201d\n\u201c We designed and funded a lot of programs that the Afghans didn \u2019 t even know about until we turned it over to them , \u201d Mr. Sopko said . \u201c Basically , dollar bills were falling from the sky . \u201d\nThe contradictions of progress in Afghanistan \u2013 and a lack of it \u2013 are evident at the Ariana Kabul Private High School in north Kabul , which teaches 350 students on a shoestring budget . It offers a 50 % discount for girls , to encourage their attendance , and also takes in a number of street kids for free .\n\u201c Most women in our community are illiterate , so if a mother is educated , it will have a direct effect , \u201d says Laila Dost , the school \u2019 s director . \u201c Our policy is to pave the way for poor urban boys and girls . \u201d\nThey share the same classrooms and same desks up to the sixth grade . Boys and girls are separated at higher grades . Such a mixed school was impossible under the Taliban in the late 1990s , when one teacher here organized secret classes for girls .\n\u201c Officially it was a holy Quran course , \u201d recalls Homira Kohi . \u201c Every student carried a holy Quran in their hand , and their [ regular ] books in their backpack . If the Taliban came , they were to immediately take hold of the Quran . \u201d\nThe official Taliban curriculum \u201c was all about conflict , guns , and bombs , \u201d she says . Students recited sentences like , \u201c My father has a gun , and with his gun he goes on jihad. \u201d Ms. Kohi was excited when the Taliban fell because Afghans thought the militants would be in the country \u201c forever . \u201d\n\u201c Every human is struggling for their desire ; we struggled so much for education , \u201d she says . \u201c Now there is a huge difference in the desire of the people . \u201d\nBut the continuing challenges of the Ariana school are evident in the deeply rutted dirt road in front of the school . A local member of Parliament lives on this street and \u2013 even though his son goes to the school \u2013 has prevented neighbors from taking up a collection to pave it . He worries that a better road will only make it easier for a suicide car bomber to attack . Ms. Dost herself has paid for gravel to be spread in front of the school when it rains and snows , because politicians \u201c build big buildings , but only \u201c think about themselves . \u201d\nIn the school \u2019 s basement , no lighting exists in two classrooms , the library , and a science area where a large periodic table hangs from the wall along with models of the human body \u2013 their sexual organs modestly covered with tape .\nThe rooms are dark because Kabul and 16 provinces , nearly half of the country , were without power in mid-September for the third time in two years . The Taliban sabotaged transmission lines bringing electricity from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan .\nPower should be available from the vast $ 335 million Tarakhil Power Plant built by the U.S. to provide the capital city with energy . But the project , completed in 2010 and labeled the \u201c white elephant of Kabul , \u201d has proved unsustainable because it requires far more diesel fuel to operate than Afghanistan can afford .\nDAVID GOLDMAN/AP/FILE Sayed Rasoul , an engineer , works in the power station at the Kajaki Dam in Afghanistan \u2019 s Helmand province . Large parts of the country are periodically without power because of disruptions caused by Taliban fighters and poor project choices made by U.S. and Afghan officials .\n\u201c Each hour , that plant uses 40,000 liters \u201d of diesel , says an electrical engineer with a detailed understanding of the project , who asked not to be named . That would cost $ 35,000 or $ 40,000 per hour , and multiplied by 24 hours , \u201c it \u2019 s a huge amount , \u201d he says .\nThe Tarakhil plant , he adds , \u201c was better for Dubai or Saudi Arabia , not for Afghanistan . Because of that , people ask : Why didn \u2019 t they build three dams with this money ? \u201d Indeed , the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in 2015 found that Tarakhil was severely underutilized , operated at less than 1 % capacity , and risked becoming a \u201c catastrophic failure . \u201d\nThe U.S. should have known about the difficulty of finding a steady supply of diesel fuel . Soon after the American arrival , another U.S. program sought to bring diesel generators to every village in the country to provide electricity . But most of them were idle within months .\nIf half the families in a village don \u2019 t have \u201c 10 afghanis [ 13 cents ] to buy bread , how do they pay 20 afghanis every night for fuel ? \u201d asks the Afghan road engineer . \u201c Actually , 20 afghanis is very little . But for local village people they have no work , no resources , nothing . \u201d\nStories abound of war profiteering . Afghan contractors and businesspeople have shipped ill-gotten gains to Dubai , United Arab Emirates , and beyond , while ordinary people scratch for bread or risk their lives on the migrant routes to Europe . But such realities mask real positive change in Afghanistan .\n\u201c Donor countries have put blood and treasure into this country , and they have made a lot of sacrifice , \u201d says Abdallah al-Dardari , the country representative of the United Nations Development Program in Kabul . \u201c Afghanistan today is not the Afghanistan of 2001 . \u201d\nOne result , says Mr. al-Dardari , is that the country \u201c has done a paradigm shift on the road to democracy , \u201d which includes political and media freedom .\nAnother is the \u201c resilience \u201d of the society and its institutions . Even though illiteracy and poverty are high , he says , people are much more sophisticated about understanding the importance of development and aid .\nStill , U.S. nation builders \u201c were very ambitious for a very long time , \u201d says a veteran Western official in Kabul . \u201c For the amount of money , they got very little . ... Their return on investment is very low , but they did achieve something . \u201d\nOn the positive side , the official notes that without the money put into rebuilding the Afghan security forces \u2013 despite high casualty rates and corruption \u2013 \u201c we would be worse off , and the Taliban would probably have taken over again by force . \u201d\nU.S. and other donor funding has been instrumental , too , in helping groups such as the Afghan Midwives Association ( AMA ) . Since 2001 , it has helped expand the number of trained Afghan midwives from 467 to 15,000 . It has reduced maternal mortality from 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births to between 800 and 1,200 deaths .\nThe improvement is evident in the \u201c stories \u201d quilted on 3-by-4-foot cloth , presented by midwives from each province to the AMA , as part of an annual competition . One narrative depicts a woman pregnant with triplets who experienced abnormal bleeding . But she gets the care she needs \u2013 and all survive . Two decades ago , the mother and babies would likely have perished , says Farzana Darkhani , AMA \u2019 s executive director .\n\u201c Fortunately , these cases are [ today ] very easily managed by midwives , \u201d says Ms. Darkhani . \u201c Because community awareness has also been improved , they know about the danger signs and can bring mothers to health facilities to take care of them . \u201d\nFawzia Koofi , a former lawmaker from the province of Badakhshan , has witnessed positive change in the country as well . When her father set up a local school four decades ago , girls had no chance to attend and families were even reluctant to send boys : The fear was they would be forced to serve in the army and learn something that contradicted their values .\n\u201c This is not something you can see because it \u2019 s not a building , it is not something measurable , \u201d says Ms. Koofi . \u201c But if you go to the same community now , even much more remote areas , people come and ask me to build schools for their girls . That is a transformation in the mindset of people , in society . \u201d\nImproving the status of women extends beyond the classroom . Zan TV , or \u201c Women \u2019 s TV , \u201d is a channel that broadcasts shows about women \u2019 s issues , with the aim of empowering Afghan women . \u201c If there were still a Taliban regime , it \u2019 s clear : There would be no Zan TV , no freedom , \u201d says Shogofa Sediqi , chief executive officer of Zan TV . She also points out that boys forced to wear turbans during the Taliban era are now professors and advisers to the president .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nAll this means that , as costly as the U.S. support of Afghanistan has been in the 18 years since the toppling of the Taliban , it has wrought significant change in a society gripped by war for decades .\n\u201c The important things that changed are in people \u2019 s minds , \u201d says Ms. Sediqi , who notes that when she first chose to be a journalist , her uncles and other relatives were opposed . \u201c Those who prevented me , now they are proud of me and say , \u2018 Your work is great , \u2019 \u201d she says . \u201c Changes start from my own family . From this , so many minds are changed . \u201d",

That would cost $35,000 or $40,000 per hour, and multiplied by 24 hours, \u201cit\u2019s a huge amount,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Tarakhil plant, he adds, \u201cwas better for Dubai or Saudi Arabia, not for Afghanistan. Because of that, people ask: Why didn\u2019t they build three dams with this money?\u201d Indeed, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in 2015 found that Tarakhil was severely underutilized, operated at less than 1% capacity, and risked becoming a \u201ccatastrophic failure.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. should have known about the difficulty of finding a steady supply of diesel fuel. Soon after the American arrival, another U.S. program sought to bring diesel generators to every village in the country to provide electricity. But most of them were idle within months.\n\nIf half the families in a village don\u2019t have \u201c10 afghanis [13 cents] to buy bread, how do they pay 20 afghanis every night for fuel?\u201d asks the Afghan road engineer. \u201cActually, 20 afghanis is very little. But for local village people they have no work, no resources, nothing.\u201d\n\nStories abound of war profiteering. Afghan contractors and businesspeople have shipped ill-gotten gains to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and beyond, while ordinary people scratch for bread or risk their lives on the migrant routes to Europe. But such realities mask real positive change in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cDonor countries have put blood and treasure into this country, and they have made a lot of sacrifice,\u201d says Abdallah al-Dardari, the country representative of the United Nations Development Program in Kabul. \u201cAfghanistan today is not the Afghanistan of 2001.\u201d\n\nOne result, says Mr. al-Dardari, is that the country \u201chas done a paradigm shift on the road to democracy,\u201d which includes political and media freedom.\n\nAnother is the \u201cresilience\u201d of the society and its institutions. Even though illiteracy and poverty are high, he says, people are much more sophisticated about understanding the importance of development and aid.\n\nStill, U.S. nation builders \u201cwere very ambitious for a very long time,\u201d says a veteran Western official in Kabul. \u201cFor the amount of money, they got very little. ... Their return on investment is very low, but they did achieve something.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side, the official notes that without the money put into rebuilding the Afghan security forces \u2013 despite high casualty rates and corruption \u2013 \u201cwe would be worse off, and the Taliban would probably have taken over again by force.\u201d\n\nU.S. and other donor funding has been instrumental, too, in helping groups such as the Afghan Midwives Association (AMA). Since 2001, it has helped expand the number of trained Afghan midwives from 467 to 15,000. It has reduced maternal mortality from 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births to between 800 and 1,200 deaths.\n\nThe improvement is evident in the \u201cstories\u201d quilted on 3-by-4-foot cloth, presented by midwives from each province to the AMA, as part of an annual competition. One narrative depicts a woman pregnant with triplets who experienced abnormal bleeding. But she gets the care she needs \u2013 and all survive. Two decades ago, the mother and babies would likely have perished, says Farzana Darkhani, AMA\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cFortunately, these cases are [today] very easily managed by midwives,\u201d says Ms. Darkhani. \u201cBecause community awareness has also been improved, they know about the danger signs and can bring mothers to health facilities to take care of them.\u201d\n\nSCOTT PETERSON/GETTY IMAGES/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR \u201cIf you go to the same community now, even much more remote areas, people come and ask me to build schools for their girls. That is a transformation in the mindset of people, in society.\u201d \u2013 Fawzia Koofi, a former lawmaker from Badakhshan province, speaking from her office in Kabul about changes in the country\n\nFawzia Koofi, a former lawmaker from the province of Badakhshan, has witnessed positive change in the country as well. When her father set up a local school four decades ago, girls had no chance to attend and families were even reluctant to send boys: The fear was they would be forced to serve in the army and learn something that contradicted their values.\n\n\u201cThis is not something you can see because it\u2019s not a building, it is not something measurable,\u201d says Ms. Koofi. \u201cBut if you go to the same community now, even much more remote areas, people come and ask me to build schools for their girls. That is a transformation in the mindset of people, in society.\u201d\n\nImproving the status of women extends beyond the classroom. Zan TV, or \u201cWomen\u2019s TV,\u201d is a channel that broadcasts shows about women\u2019s issues, with the aim of empowering Afghan women. \u201cIf there were still a Taliban regime, it\u2019s clear: There would be no Zan TV, no freedom,\u201d says Shogofa Sediqi, chief executive officer of Zan TV. She also points out that boys forced to wear turbans during the Taliban era are now professors and advisers to the president.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

From this, so many minds are changed.\u201d",
