A new future requires brand-new leadership . \u201d\n\u201c You 're living in poverty , your schools are no good , you have no jobs . Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed . What the hell do you have to lose ? \u201d Speaking before another largely-white audience in a town whose population is 93 percent white , Trump said , \u201c And at the end of four years , I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote . I promise you . Because I will produce . \u201d\n\u201c No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton 's policies than African-Americans . No group . No group , \u201d he said . \u201c If Hillary Clinton 's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community , she could not have done a better job . It 's a disgrace . Tonight , I 'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future . \u201d\nThe former reality TV star 's 95 percent pledge was an ad-libbed moment in a speech that was scripted and delivered with the help of teleprompters , aides that Trump has shunned for much of his campaign in favor of a more off-the-cuff approach . It is the second speech delivered by Trump since Wednesday \u2019 s promotion of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway , who is believed to have been elevated to help the GOP nominee remain focused and on-message .\nAs a remedy to the problems that Trump said beset the African-American community in the U.S. , Trump prescribed much of his usual policy proposals : school choice , tougher immigration laws , more efficient government and trade policies that promote American job growth .\nTrump has struggled thus far with black voters in the election , polling as low as 0 percent and 1 percent at times , although the margin of error could put his actual support among African-Americans higher . President Barack Obama received 96 percent of the African-American vote in his first presidential campaign and 93 percent of it in his successful 2012 reelection bid .\n\u201c The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for more than 50 years . Their policies have produced only poverty , joblessness , failing schools and broken homes , \u201d Trump said . \u201c It \u2019 s time to hold Democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities . At what point do we say enough ? At what point do we say enough ? \u201d\nShortly after the real estate mogul concluded his speech , CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Trump campaign senior adviser Jack Kingston why Trump continued to reach out to the black community in rallies with mostly white audiences held in areas where few African-Americans live .\n\u201c Maybe it would have been nice if he went and had a backdrop with a burning car , \u201d Kingston replied . `` His rallies are open to the public . Last night in North Carolina we saw a lot of African-Americans . I was n't sure about the crowd content tonight\u2026 but they \u2019 re open to the public , and I mean , there \u2019 s nothing exclusive .

Because the truth is , no Republican has ever had the courage '' to offer African Americans a compelling reason to vote for the GOP , Gingrich said .\nBut such speeches , Gingrich said , would come with `` enormous demonstrations '' because `` left-wing activists can not allow a Republican to have a genuine conversation in the black community .

''\nAt Friday 's rally , a day after offering a surprising expression of \u201c regret \u201d if any of his rhetoric had created personal pain , Trump attacked Clinton for not showing similar remorse over her own bevy of scandals and controversial statements .
