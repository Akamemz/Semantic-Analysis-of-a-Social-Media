    "content": "The president \u2019 s tweeting was once a sideshow . But it transformed how he exerted power , leaving the White House and Twitter to grapple over whether , and how , to rein it in .\nIn the past three months , President Trump \u2019 s tweets have spilled out at triple the rate he set in 2017 .\nAt the beginning of his presidency , Mr. Trump tweeted about nine times per day .\nWhat followed was a barrage of personal attacks , outrage and boasting , in a near-constant stream of more than 11,000 tweets over 33 months .\nOn the morning of Inauguration Day 2017 , Donald J. Trump tweeted an opening message to the United States .\nIn the Oval Office , an annoyed President Trump ended an argument he was having with his aides . He reached into a drawer , took out his iPhone and threw it on top of the historic Resolute Desk :\nThere was no missing Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat that day in early 2017 , the aides recalled . With a tweet , he could fling a directive to the world , and there was nothing they could do about it .\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office , Twitter was a political tool that had helped get him elected and a digital howitzer that he relished firing . In the years since , he has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration , reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power .\nAfter Turkey invaded northern Syria this past month , he crafted his response not only in White House meetings but also in a series of contradictory tweets . This summer , he announced increased tariffs on $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods , using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries . And in March , Mr. Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy , tweeting his recognition of Israel \u2019 s sovereignty in the Golan Heights . He openly delighted in the reaction he provoked .\n\u201c Boom . I press it , \u201d Mr. Trump recalled months later at a White House conference attended by conservative social media personalities , \u201c and , within two seconds , \u2018 We have breaking news . \u2019 \u201d\nEarly on , top aides wanted to restrain the president \u2019 s Twitter habit , even considering asking the company to impose a 15-minute delay on Mr. Trump \u2019 s messages . But 11,390 presidential tweets later , many administration officials and lawmakers embrace his Twitter obsession , flocking to his social media chief with suggestions . Policy meetings are hijacked when Mr. Trump gets an idea for a tweet , drawing in cabinet members and others for wordsmithing . And as a president often at war with his own bureaucracy , he deploys Twitter to break through logjams , overrule or humiliate recalcitrant advisers and pre-empt his staff .\n\u201c He needs to tweet like we need to eat , \u201d Kellyanne Conway , his White House counselor , said in an interview .\nIn a presidency unlike any other , where Mr. Trump wakes to Twitter , goes to bed with it and is comforted by how much it revolves around him , the person he most often singled out for praise was himself \u2014 more than 2,000 times , according to an analysis by The New York Times .\nPresident Trump is tweeting more than ever . The second week of October was his busiest , with 271 tweets . He regularly takes to Twitter to lash out at his perceived enemies . In fact , he attacks someone or something in more than half of his tweets . 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct .\nMost of these attacks occur in the early morning or later in the evening , when Mr. Trump is more likely to be without his advisers . 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets , by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m. 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets , by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m .\nThe Times examined Mr. Trump \u2019 s use of Twitter since taking office , reviewing all his tweets , retweets and followers , and interviewing nearly 50 current and former administration officials , lawmakers and Twitter executives and employees . What has emerged is a rich account , with new analysis , previously unreported episodes and fresh details of how the president exploits the platform to exert power .\n[ Read how Times journalists sorted more than 11,000 of Donald Trump \u2019 s Twitter posts . ]\nNo . of tweets ... that 5,889 attacked someone or something 4,876 praised someone or something 2,405 attacked Democrats 2,065 attacked investigations 2,026 praised President Trump 1,710 promoted conspiracy theories 1,308 attacked news organizations 851 attacked minority groups 758 praised or promoted Fox News and other conservative media 570 attacked immigrants 453 attacked previous presidential administrations 417 conducted presidential business on Twitter 256 attacked Hillary Clinton 233 attacked ally nations 183 bragged about crowd size and applause 132 praised dictators 95 referred to a Trump business 40 promoted voter fraud conspiracy theories 36 called the news media the \u201c enemy of the people \u201d 16 referred to himself as everyone \u2019 s \u201c favorite \u201d president Show more Tweets from Jan. 20 , 2017 to Oct. 15 , 2019 .\nIt is often by brute repetition . He has taken to Twitter to demand action 1,159 times on immigration and his border wall , a top priority , and 521 times on tariffs , another key agenda item . Twitter is an instrument of his foreign policy : He has praised dictators more than a hundred times , while complaining nearly twice as much about America \u2019 s traditional allies . Twitter is the Trump administration \u2019 s de facto personnel office : The chief executive has announced the departures of more than two dozen top officials , some fired by tweet .\nMore than half of the president \u2019 s posts \u2014 5,889 \u2014 have been attacks ; no other category even comes close . His targets include the Russia investigation , a Federal Reserve that won \u2019 t bow to his whims , previous administrations , entire cities that are led by Democrats , and adversaries from outspoken athletes to chief executives who displease him . Like no other modern president , Mr. Trump has publicly harangued businesses to advance his political goals and silence criticism , often with talk of government intervention . Using Twitter , he threatened \u201c Saturday Night Live \u201d with an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and accused Amazon , led by Jeff Bezos , owner of The Washington Post , of cheating the United States Postal Service .\nAs much as anything , Twitter is the broadcast network for Mr. Trump \u2019 s parallel political reality \u2014 the \u201c alternative facts \u201d he has used to spread conspiracy theories , fake information and extremist content , including material that energizes some of his base .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s use of Twitter has accelerated sharply since the end of the special counsel \u2019 s Russia investigation and reached a new high as Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry , the analysis shows . He tweeted more than 500 times during the first two weeks of October , a pace that put him on track to triple his monthly average . ( The Times analyzed Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweets through Oct. 15 . The total by the end of the month reached 11,887 . )\nHis more than 66 million Twitter followers have become his private polling service , offering what he sees as validation for his performance in office . But fewer than one-fifth of his followers are voting-age Americans , according to a Times analysis of Pew Research national surveys of adults who use Twitter .\nThe White House press office declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president . Now , as Mr. Trump anticipates a bitter re-election battle and faces an impeachment inquiry by Democrats , the stakes are higher than ever before , and Twitter even more central to his presidency .\nHis top campaign aides are embracing the outrage that Mr. Trump stirs with his tweets to reinforce his anti-establishment brand and strengthen his bond with the fiercely loyal supporters who propelled him into office . And as public backing for impeachment grows , the president is using the platform to build a defensive echo chamber .\nMr. Trump tweeted his first attack as president on his third day in office . He fired off more than 1,100 attacks over the next year . The most frequent targets of Mr. Trump \u2019 s ire are Democrats , news organizations and investigations \u2014 specifically the Russia and impeachment inquiries . Mr. Trump \u2019 s attack on four Democratic congresswomen of color in July received a lot of attention , and blowback . It was not the first time he had used Twitter to attack minority groups \u2014 and it would not be the last . The president has tweeted more attacks so far this year than in the previous two years combined . In total , he has attacked at least 630 people and things in 5,889 tweets since taking office .\nWhile people around Mr. Trump acknowledge that his tweets can cause political damage , the president is confident in his mastery of Twitter .\nThis past week , as he announced that American Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of the Islamic State , Mr. Trump noted the terror group \u2019 s digital prowess . \u201c They use the internet better than almost anybody in the world , \u201d he said . \u201c Perhaps other than Donald Trump . \u201d\nWith a single tweet last fall , Mr. Trump sent his administration into a tailspin . \u201c I must , in the strongest of terms , ask Mexico to stop this onslaught , \u201d he wrote in October 2018 , angry about a caravan of migrants from Central America . \u201c If unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ! \u201d\nMr. Trump \u2019 s aides had tried for weeks to talk him out of shutting down the border \u2014 the logistics would be impossible and the economic pain extreme . The tweet prompted an emergency meeting down the hall from the Oval Office as aides scrambled to head off Mr. Trump \u2019 s impulse , according to people familiar with the frantic scene . Like others in this article , they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the president .\nThe aides succeeded in temporarily holding him off , but the tweet crystallized for cautious bureaucrats exactly what he wanted : to stop people from coming into the country . In the months that followed , Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat helped to set off an effort inside the government to find ever more restrictive ways to block immigrants . Nearly six months later , Kirstjen Nielsen , the homeland security secretary , was still trying to prevent a border shutdown when the president brought her resistance to an end .\nThis is governing in the Trump era . For President Barack Obama , a tweet about a presidential proposal might mark the conclusion of a long , deliberative process . For Mr. Trump , Twitter is often the beginning of how policy is made .\n\u201c Suddenly there \u2019 s a tweet , and everything gets upended and you spent the week trying to defend something else , \u201d said Representative Peter King , Republican of New York . \u201c This person thrives on chaos . What we may find disconcerting or upsetting or whatever , it is actually what keeps him going . \u201d\nIn October 2017 , Rex W. Tillerson , the president \u2019 s first secretary of state , was in China with a team of diplomats negotiating sanctions on Kim Jong-un , the North Korean leader , when Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter . Mr. Tillerson was \u201c wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man , \u201d he wrote . \u201c Save your energy Rex , we \u2019 ll do what has to be done ! \u201d\nTwo months later , a Reuters headline blared that Mick Mulvaney , who then was Mr. Trump \u2019 s new pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , had decided to put \u201c on ice \u201d sanctions against Wells Fargo for consumer abuses . It was little surprise : Mr. Mulvaney was an ally of the financial industry . But Mr. Trump had other ideas .\n\u201c Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped , as has incorrectly been reported , but will be pursued and , if anything , substantially increased , \u201d he tweeted .\nPolitical appointees at the bureau wanted to affirm Mr. Trump \u2019 s desire publicly , despite longstanding policies against commenting on active investigations , according to former officials there . A spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney issued a statement saying only that he \u201c shares the president \u2019 s firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers . \u201d\nAccording to two people with direct knowledge of the Wells Fargo inquiry , career bureau officials took Mr. Trump \u2019 s outburst as a green light to pursue aggressive negotiations with the bank , even as Mr. Mulvaney \u2019 s team prepared to dial back penalties in other cases or shelve them . Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to a billion-dollar federal settlement , the bureau \u2019 s largest-ever civil penalty .\nOver time , Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a means of presidential communication as vital as a statement from the White House press secretary or an Oval Office address . The press secretary has not held a daily on-camera press briefing \u2014 a decades-long ritual of presidential messaging \u2014 since March . Instead , Mr. Trump \u2019 s Twitter activity drives the day .\nAnd Mr. Trump has removed any doubt that his tweets carry the weight once reserved for more formal pronouncements .\nIn summer 2018 , his aides repeatedly tried to reassure Republican lawmakers that the president backed their hard-line immigration bill , despite his remarks suggesting otherwise . But privately , Mr. Trump told several senators that there was only one certain sign of his support .\n\u201c If I don \u2019 t tweet it , \u201d he said , according to two former senior advisers , \u201c don \u2019 t listen to my staff . \u201d\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office , aides were determined to rein in his itchy Twitter fingers .\nIn a series of informal conversations in early 2017 , top White House officials discussed the possibility of a 15-minute delay on the president \u2019 s account , a technical change not unlike the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks . But , one former senior official said , they quickly abandoned the idea after recognizing the political peril if it leaked to the press \u2014 or to their boss .\nSeveral weeks later , a trio of close advisers presented Mr. Trump with another idea . Gary Cohn , the top economic adviser ; Hope Hicks , the president \u2019 s director of strategic communications ; and Rob Porter , his staff secretary , argued that they should see the tweets before he sent them out .\nMr. Trump was skeptical , worrying that delayed tweets would be irrelevant , according to a former White House official . But he agreed to a weeklong trial . Within 72 hours , the president had resumed tweeting from his golf club in Bedminster , N.J .\nThree thousand miles away , in Silicon Valley , similar conversations were unfolding at Twitter \u2019 s offices , where executives faced the same dilemma as Mr. Trump \u2019 s inner circle : whether , and how , to restrain him .\nAt the time , Twitter lagged far behind larger competitors like Facebook . While popular among politicians and journalists , it was struggling financially . But the president \u2019 s incessant tweeting gave the company more currency .\nHis Twitter account often drove more \u201c impressions \u201d \u2014 a key company metric \u2014 than any other in the world . But some of his messages seemed to violate the company \u2019 s policies against abuse and incitement .\nMany of the president \u2019 s tweets promoted conspiracy theories or tried to erode faith in democratic institutions . On his sixth day in office , he advanced the false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election , depriving him of a popular-vote majority . He has tweeted 40 times about voter fraud and a \u201c rigged \u201d electoral system . Less than a month into his presidency , Mr. Trump tweeted that Democrats made up Russian interference in the 2016 election to justify Hillary Clinton \u2019 s loss . He then accused Mr. Obama of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign . He has since sown doubt about Russian interference and the resulting investigations in more than 1,400 tweets . Mr. Trump has also used Twitter to attack the credibility of journalists , intelligence agencies and the judicial system . He has spoken of a nefarious \u201c deep state \u201d undermining his presidency , a judiciary that puts the country in \u201c peril \u201d and a news media that is \u201c the enemy of the people , \u201d a phrase historically used by autocrats . The president also pushed unfounded claims that Big Tech is biased against conservatives ( 102 tweets ) , stoked fears that caravans of migrants were going to \u201c invade \u201d the United States ( 43 tweets ) , and questioned the number of people killed in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria ( 5 tweets ) . All told , Mr. Trump tweeted conspiratorial language more than 1,700 times .\nOn a now-defunct internal company message board known as Twitter Buzz , some left-leaning employees favored barring the president . Mr. Trump \u2019 s behavior came up at almost every all-hands gathering and at many smaller meetings of executives . Some of them had set their phones to alert them whenever the president tweeted , according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of confidentiality .\n\u201c What I saw was a company coming to grips with an entirely new situation , a new level of scrutiny , a new level of vitriol , \u201d said Dianna Colasurdo , a former account executive on Twitter \u2019 s political advertising sales team , \u201c and working to adapt their policies in the moment to align with that . \u201d\nA turning point came in fall 2017 , at the height of tensions with North Korea , when Mr. Trump tweeted that the rogue nation might not \u201c be around much longer ! \u201d The country \u2019 s foreign minister called that a declaration of war . On Twitter , users wondered if the company would allow Mr. Trump to tweet his way into a nuclear conflict .\nThe response came the next day . Referring back to Mr. Trump \u2019 s online declaration , Twitter announced in a tweet that it took \u201c newsworthiness \u201d into account when evaluating whether to remove a post that violated its policies .\nIn an interview , Twitter executives said that newsworthiness had long figured into the company \u2019 s internal enforcement guidelines and that officials there had been formulating the announcement , which applied worldwide , months before Mr. Trump \u2019 s North Korea tweet . But former employees said they understood the announcement to be Trump-driven . Twitter did not want to be in the business of censoring the president .\nLate in summer 2018 , White House insiders tried again to curb Mr. Trump \u2019 s use of social media , according to two former aides . After a series of over-the-top weeks of tweeting \u2014 including calling Omarosa Manigault Newman , his onetime aide , \u201c wacky \u201d and \u201c a lowlife \u201d \u2014 several advisers suggested he go just two days without Twitter and see what happened . Mr. Trump nodded , and then promptly discarded the advice .\nMr. King , who said most of his Republican colleagues wished the president would tweet less , added that whenever he had raised the issue with White House staff members , they shrugged helplessly .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not going to stop , \u201d he recalled their saying . \u201c Forget it ; we \u2019 ve all tried . \u201d\nOn Sept. 13 , he mocked Jamie Dimon , the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , for claiming he could beat Mr. Trump in an election . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t have the aptitude or \u2018 smarts \u2019 & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess , \u201d the president tweeted . Over the next 12 hours , Mr. Trump attacked two former F.B.I . officials , accused The Wall Street Journal of getting a tariff story wrong and blasted former Secretary of State John Kerry for holding \u201c illegal meetings \u201d with Iran .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s Twitter habit is most intense in the morning , when he is in the White House residence , watching Fox News , scrolling through his Twitter mentions and turning the social media platform into what one aide called the \u201c ultimate weapon of mass dissemination . \u201d\nOf the attack tweets identified in the Times analysis , nearly half were sent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. , hours that Mr. Trump spends mostly without advisers present .\nAfter waking early , Mr. Trump typically watches news shows recorded the previous night on his \u201c Super TiVo , \u201d several DVRs connected to a single remote . ( The devices are set to record \u201c Lou Dobbs Tonight \u201d on Fox Business Network ; \u201c Hannity , \u201d \u201c Tucker Carlson Tonight \u201d and \u201c The Story With Martha MacCallum \u201d on Fox News ; and \u201c Anderson Cooper 360 \u201d on CNN . )\nHe takes in those shows , and the \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d morning program , then flings out comments on his iPhone . Then he watches as his tweets reverberate on cable channels and news sites .\nThe symbiotic relationship between Mr. Trump and Fox News is apparent through the president \u2019 s tweets . In fact , he praised the network in his first tweet on the first morning he woke up in the White House . He has since praised and promoted the network , individual shows and conservative news media personalities more than 750 times . Over all , at least 15 percent of the content in Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweets seemed to come directly from Fox News and other conservative media outlets .\nEarly on Sept. 2 \u2014 the start of a week in which he tweeted 198 times \u2014 the president sent a few benign tweets , then lashed out at Paul Krugman as a \u201c Failing New York Times columnist \u201d who \u201c never got it ! \u201d Over the next 44 minutes , he fired off 10 more tweets . He disparaged Richard Trumka , the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O . ( \u201c Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. \u201d ) He called James B. Comey , the former F.B.I . director , and his \u201c dwindling group of friends \u201d liars and traitors . He railed against The Washington Post and four women of color in Congress who called themselves \u201c the Squad . \u201d\nAlmost every morning that week , Mr. Trump kicked off the day with an attack on one critic or another : the \u201c incompetent Mayor of London , \u201d or \u201c Bad \u2018 actress \u2019 Debra The Mess Messing \u201d \u2014 whom he accused of being racist \u2014 or the \u201c Fake News Media. \u201d He referred to conservative media outlets 45 times , berated the mainstream media 32 times and tweeted about conspiracy theories 12 times .\nSometimes the president \u2019 s apparent fury on Twitter is meant to troll his critics and get a rise out of them , many of his closest aides said . But they still brace themselves , knowing that they are likely to be blindsided by one of his tweets . Aides who gather for the early-morning staff meetings in the West Wing said their agenda was regularly blown up when their phones simultaneously went off with a tweet from the boss .\nOnce Mr. Trump arrives in the West Wing \u2014 usually after 10 a.m. \u2014 Dan Scavino , the White House social media director , takes control of the Twitter account , tweeting as @ realDonaldTrump from his own phone or computer . Mr. Trump rarely tweets in front of others , those close to him say , because he does not like to wear the reading glasses he needs to see the screen .\nInstead , the president dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino , who sits in a closet-size room just off the Oval Office until Mr. Trump calls out \u201c Scavino ! \u201d Often , he prints out suggested tweets in extra-large fonts for the president to sign off on . ( A single-page article that Mr. Scavino recently printed out for him ran to six pages after the fonts were enlarged , according to one person who saw it . )\nMr. Scavino \u2019 s role in Mr. Trump \u2019 s Twitter machine has made him an unlikely White House power broker and the go-to person for aides , business executives , friends and lawmakers who want the president to tweet something . Ms. Conway noted what she called the hypocrisy of many Republicans who begged her to get Mr. Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign and now come to Mr. Scavino with suggestions . Mr. Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article .\nHe sometimes acts as a brake \u2014 or tries to \u2014 on the president \u2019 s tweeting impulses . When Mr. Trump started angrily posting about the \u201c Squad , \u201d Mr. Scavino told him it was a bad idea , according to an aide who witnessed the conversation . Along with Michael Dubke , who served as White House communications director for several months in 2017 and is from Buffalo , home of the famous chicken wings , Mr. Scavino presented some tweets to Mr. Trump in degrees of outrageousness : \u201c hot , \u201d \u201c medium \u201d or \u201c mild. \u201d Mr. Trump , said one former official who saw the proposed messages , always picked the most incendiary ones and often wanted to make them even more provocative .\nAnd while many of Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweets are shoot-from-the-hip attacks , he chews over others for days or even weeks , waiting for just the right moment to maximize the reaction , aides say .\nHe plotted for days to tweet about Mika Brzezinski , the liberal co-host of the popular MSNBC morning program , according to former White House officials , before finally posting one morning in June 2017 . He called her \u201c low I.Q . Crazy Mika \u201d and wrote that she had been \u201c bleeding badly from a face-lift \u201d during a New Year \u2019 s Eve party .\nIn October of last year , the president started telling his aides that he planned to denounce Stormy Daniels , a pornographic-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him more than a decade earlier . He said he wanted to call her a \u201c horse face . \u201d\nSeveral current and former aides recalled telling Mr. Trump that it was a terrible idea and would renew accusations of misogyny against him . But he persisted .\nFinally , after watching a Fox News report days later about how a federal judge had thrown out a lawsuit by Ms. Daniels , the president tapped out the tweet .\n\u201c Great , now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas , \u201d he wrote .\nFor Mr. Trump , Twitter reinforces his instincts about his performance as president .\nAfter a rally in Dallas in mid-October , Mr. Trump \u2019 s aides prepared a large-type printout of tweets gushing over his speech that day , including one from Tomi Lahren , a Fox News commentator and the host of a show on the Fox Nation site . Mr. Trump scrawled a thank-you note on one copy to Ms. Lahren \u2014 who then tweeted a picture of the letter back at the president .\nAides said they often compiled positive feedback for Mr. Trump . He revels in the stream of praise from his most loyal followers , on paper or as he scrolls through his phone early in the morning and late at night . He considers his following to be like the ratings on a TV show , better than any approval poll . After one weekend Twitter spree , the president told Sarah Huckabee Sanders , his press secretary at the time , he had expected a tweet he was particularly proud of to get more response than it did , according to a former administration official . Ms. Sanders said that if he tweeted 60 times , people wouldn \u2019 t pay as much attention , the official said .\nThe president is keenly aware of his number of followers and reluctant to acknowledge that any of them are not real . Mr. Trump has accused Twitter of political bias for its periodic purges of bot accounts across the platform , which have cost him \u2014 and other prominent users \u2014 hundreds of thousands of followers . When he met with the company \u2019 s chief executive , Jack Dorsey , in April , Mr. Trump reportedly pressed him at length about the lost followers .\nThere is plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump \u2019 s Twitter following may not be a reliable proxy for what the American people think of the job he is doing .\nIt is difficult , if not impossible , to determine with certainty how many of Mr. Trump \u2019 s more than 66 million followers are fake . Some studies of his followers have estimated that a high proportion are likely to be automated bots , fake accounts or inactive . But even a conservative analysis by The Times found that nearly a third of them , about 22 million , included no biographical information and used the service \u2019 s default profile image \u2014 two signs the accounts may be rarely used or inactive . Fourteen percent have automatically generated user names , another indication that an account may not belong to a real person .\nEven if Mr. Trump is not shouting into the void on Twitter , he is often preaching to the converted . Data from Stirista , an analytics firm , shows that his followers tend to be the kind of users who are most likely to be his supporters \u2014 disproportionately older , white and male compared with Twitter users over all .\nAnd they constitute just a fraction of the electorate . According to the Times analysis of Pew data , only about four percent of American adults , or about 11 million people , follow him on Twitter . Those followers represent less that one-fifth of his total , the analysis shows .\nAccording to data from YouGov , which polls about most of the president \u2019 s tweets , some of the topics on which Mr. Trump got the most likes and retweets \u2014 jabs at the N.F.L. , posts about the special counsel \u2019 s investigation , unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud \u2014 poll poorly with the general public .\nBut people close to Mr. Trump said there was no dissuading him that the \u201c likes \u201d a tweet got were evidence that a decision or policy proposal was well received .\nLast December , after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw some troops from Syria , lawmakers came to the White House to argue against it . According to Politico , Mr. Trump responded by calling in Mr. Scavino .\n\u201c Tell them how popular my policy is , \u201d Mr. Trump asked Mr. Scavino , who described for the lawmakers social media postings that had praised Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision . Aides said that for Mr. Trump , his Twitter \u201c likes \u201d were proof that he had made the right call .\nThe reaction in the outside world was far less favorable . Within weeks , Mr. Trump \u2019 s defense secretary and the special anti-ISIS envoy quit over the decision . American allies were enraged . More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to rebuke Mr. Trump , who agreed under pressure to keep the troops in Syria .\nAlmost a year later , American troops in Syria became an issue again after Mr. Trump appeared to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria .\nThat resulted in another congressional rebuke for Mr. Trump and complaints even from loyal Republican allies . In subsequent days , Mr. Trump sought to defend himself on Twitter , alternately denying he had abandoned the Kurds and suggesting the United States had no stake in their safety , threatening Mr. Erdogan if the incursion continued and praising Turkey as an important trading partner .\nMany people took note of the back-and-forth , including Mr. Erdogan . \u201c When we take a look at Mr. Trump \u2019 s Twitter posts , we can no longer follow them , \u201d the Turkish president told reporters mockingly in mid-October , according to Hurriyet , a Turkish newspaper . \u201c We can not keep track . \u201d\nMr. Trump was not all negative . He also used Twitter to express admiration for people , from Aretha Franklin to Ryan Zinke . He often coupled his praise with a jab at someone else , or vice versa . He praised himself more than he did anyone else . All told , Mr. Trump sent 4,876 tweets that expressed approval or praise .\nIn the months ahead , the man tasked with winning Mr. Trump a second term is hoping to focus the president \u2019 s Twitter habit on its original purpose : connecting with voters .\nBrad Parscale , who served as Mr. Trump \u2019 s digital director in 2016 and is now campaign manager , has worked closely with Mr. Scavino to shape perceptions of the president through social media . The two men speak a half-dozen times a day , according to people familiar with their interactions .\nMr. Parscale criticized Twitter after it announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow paid political advertising on the platform , calling it \u201c yet another attempt to silence conservatives. \u201d But the change may benefit Mr. Trump : He has a far larger organic Twitter following than any of his likely Democratic opponents , and is therefore less reliant on paid ads to spread his message through the platform .\nWhile some campaign aides say Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweets can be a distraction , they also view Twitter as an essential tool to present him as someone strong , willing to stand up to so-called political elites and what the president recently called the \u201c unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians , deep-state bureaucrats and the fake-news media . \u201d\nThe aides seek to cultivate the image of a man who understands \u201c regular people. \u201d Mr. Trump \u2019 s team believes that his unvarnished writing , poor punctuation and increasing profanity on Twitter signal authenticity \u2014 a contrast to the polished , vetted , often anodyne social media style of most candidates .\nTwitter , Ms. Conway said , is the president \u2019 s most potent weapon when it comes to bypassing the powerful people he believes have controlled the flow of information too long .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the democratization of information , \u201d she said . Everyone receives Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweets at once \u2014 the stay-at-home mom , the plumber working on the sink , the billionaire executive , the White House correspondent .\n\u201c They all hear \u2018 ping , \u2019 \u201d she said , \u201c at the same time . \u201d",
    "content_original": "The president\u2019s tweeting was once a sideshow. But it transformed how he exerted power, leaving the White House and Twitter to grapple over whether, and how, to rein it in.\n\nIn the past three months, President Trump\u2019s tweets have spilled out at triple the rate he set in 2017.\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency, Mr. Trump tweeted about nine times per day.\n\nWhat followed was a barrage of personal attacks, outrage and boasting, in a near-constant stream of more than 11,000 tweets over 33 months.\n\nOn the morning of Inauguration Day 2017, Donald J. Trump tweeted an opening message to the United States.\n\nIn the Oval Office, an annoyed President Trump ended an argument he was having with his aides. He reached into a drawer, took out his iPhone and threw it on top of the historic Resolute Desk:\n\n\u201cDo you want me to settle this right now?\u201d\n\nThere was no missing Mr. Trump\u2019s threat that day in early 2017, the aides recalled. With a tweet, he could fling a directive to the world, and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office, Twitter was a political tool that had helped get him elected and a digital howitzer that he relished firing. In the years since, he has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration, reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power.\n\nAfter Turkey invaded northern Syria this past month, he crafted his response not only in White House meetings but also in a series of contradictory tweets. This summer, he announced increased tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries. And in March, Mr. Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy, tweeting his recognition of Israel\u2019s sovereignty in the Golan Heights. He openly delighted in the reaction he provoked.\n\n\u201cBoom. I press it,\u201d Mr. Trump recalled months later at a White House conference attended by conservative social media personalities, \u201cand, within two seconds, \u2018We have breaking news.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarly on, top aides wanted to restrain the president\u2019s Twitter habit, even considering asking the company to impose a 15-minute delay on Mr. Trump\u2019s messages. But 11,390 presidential tweets later, many administration officials and lawmakers embrace his Twitter obsession, flocking to his social media chief with suggestions. Policy meetings are hijacked when Mr. Trump gets an idea for a tweet, drawing in cabinet members and others for wordsmithing. And as a president often at war with his own bureaucracy, he deploys Twitter to break through logjams, overrule or humiliate recalcitrant advisers and pre-empt his staff.\n\n\u201cHe needs to tweet like we need to eat,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, his White House counselor, said in an interview.\n\nIn a presidency unlike any other, where Mr. Trump wakes to Twitter, goes to bed with it and is comforted by how much it revolves around him, the person he most often singled out for praise was himself \u2014 more than 2,000 times, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nPresident Trump is tweeting more than ever. The second week of October was his busiest, with 271 tweets. He regularly takes to Twitter to lash out at his perceived enemies. In fact, he attacks someone or something in more than half of his tweets. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct. 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 2018 2019 250 tweets per week 200 150 100 50 2017 April July Oct. 2018 April July Oct. 2019 April July Oct.\n\nMost of these attacks occur in the early morning or later in the evening, when Mr. Trump is more likely to be without his advisers. 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets, by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m. 1,200 tweets 1,000 Total tweets, by hour tweeted 800 600 400 All tweets 200 Attacks 2 a.m. 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m. 10 p.m.\n\nThe Times examined Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter since taking office, reviewing all his tweets, retweets and followers, and interviewing nearly 50 current and former administration officials, lawmakers and Twitter executives and employees. What has emerged is a rich account, with new analysis, previously unreported episodes and fresh details of how the president exploits the platform to exert power.\n\n[Read how Times journalists sorted more than 11,000 of Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter posts.]\n\nNo. of tweets ... that 5,889 attacked someone or something 4,876 praised someone or something 2,405 attacked Democrats 2,065 attacked investigations 2,026 praised President Trump 1,710 promoted conspiracy theories 1,308 attacked news organizations 851 attacked minority groups 758 praised or promoted Fox News and other conservative media 570 attacked immigrants 453 attacked previous presidential administrations 417 conducted presidential business on Twitter 256 attacked Hillary Clinton 233 attacked ally nations 183 bragged about crowd size and applause 132 praised dictators 95 referred to a Trump business 40 promoted voter fraud conspiracy theories 36 called the news media the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d 16 referred to himself as everyone\u2019s \u201cfavorite\u201d president Show more Tweets from Jan. 20, 2017 to Oct. 15, 2019.\n\nIt is often by brute repetition. He has taken to Twitter to demand action 1,159 times on immigration and his border wall, a top priority, and 521 times on tariffs, another key agenda item. Twitter is an instrument of his foreign policy: He has praised dictators more than a hundred times, while complaining nearly twice as much about America\u2019s traditional allies. Twitter is the Trump administration\u2019s de facto personnel office: The chief executive has announced the departures of more than two dozen top officials, some fired by tweet.\n\nMore than half of the president\u2019s posts \u2014 5,889 \u2014 have been attacks; no other category even comes close. His targets include the Russia investigation, a Federal Reserve that won\u2019t bow to his whims, previous administrations, entire cities that are led by Democrats, and adversaries from outspoken athletes to chief executives who displease him. Like no other modern president, Mr. Trump has publicly harangued businesses to advance his political goals and silence criticism, often with talk of government intervention. Using Twitter, he threatened \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and accused Amazon, led by Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, of cheating the United States Postal Service.\n\nAs much as anything, Twitter is the broadcast network for Mr. Trump\u2019s parallel political reality \u2014 the \u201calternative facts\u201d he has used to spread conspiracy theories, fake information and extremist content, including material that energizes some of his base.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter has accelerated sharply since the end of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation and reached a new high as Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry, the analysis shows. He tweeted more than 500 times during the first two weeks of October, a pace that put him on track to triple his monthly average. (The Times analyzed Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets through Oct. 15. The total by the end of the month reached 11,887.)\n\nHis more than 66 million Twitter followers have become his private polling service, offering what he sees as validation for his performance in office. But fewer than one-fifth of his followers are voting-age Americans, according to a Times analysis of Pew Research national surveys of adults who use Twitter.\n\nThe White House press office declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. Now, as Mr. Trump anticipates a bitter re-election battle and faces an impeachment inquiry by Democrats, the stakes are higher than ever before, and Twitter even more central to his presidency.\n\nHis top campaign aides are embracing the outrage that Mr. Trump stirs with his tweets to reinforce his anti-establishment brand and strengthen his bond with the fiercely loyal supporters who propelled him into office. And as public backing for impeachment grows, the president is using the platform to build a defensive echo chamber.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted his first attack as president on his third day in office. He fired off more than 1,100 attacks over the next year. The most frequent targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire are Democrats, news organizations and investigations \u2014 specifically the Russia and impeachment inquiries. Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on four Democratic congresswomen of color in July received a lot of attention, and blowback. It was not the first time he had used Twitter to attack minority groups \u2014 and it would not be the last. The president has tweeted more attacks so far this year than in the previous two years combined. In total, he has attacked at least 630 people and things in 5,889 tweets since taking office.\n\nWhile people around Mr. Trump acknowledge that his tweets can cause political damage, the president is confident in his mastery of Twitter.\n\nThis past week, as he announced that American Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, Mr. Trump noted the terror group\u2019s digital prowess. \u201cThey use the internet better than almost anybody in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps other than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nPolicy via Twitter\n\nWith a single tweet last fall, Mr. Trump sent his administration into a tailspin. \u201cI must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught,\u201d he wrote in October 2018, angry about a caravan of migrants from Central America. \u201cIf unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides had tried for weeks to talk him out of shutting down the border \u2014 the logistics would be impossible and the economic pain extreme. The tweet prompted an emergency meeting down the hall from the Oval Office as aides scrambled to head off Mr. Trump\u2019s impulse, according to people familiar with the frantic scene. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the president.\n\nThe aides succeeded in temporarily holding him off, but the tweet crystallized for cautious bureaucrats exactly what he wanted: to stop people from coming into the country. In the months that followed, Mr. Trump\u2019s threat helped to set off an effort inside the government to find ever more restrictive ways to block immigrants. Nearly six months later, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was still trying to prevent a border shutdown when the president brought her resistance to an end.\n\n\u201cKirstjen Nielsen,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cwill be leaving her position.\u201d\n\nThis is governing in the Trump era. For President Barack Obama, a tweet about a presidential proposal might mark the conclusion of a long, deliberative process. For Mr. Trump, Twitter is often the beginning of how policy is made.\n\n\u201cSuddenly there\u2019s a tweet, and everything gets upended and you spent the week trying to defend something else,\u201d said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. \u201cThis person thrives on chaos. What we may find disconcerting or upsetting or whatever, it is actually what keeps him going.\u201d\n\nIn October 2017, Rex W. Tillerson, the president\u2019s first secretary of state, was in China with a team of diplomats negotiating sanctions on Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, when Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter. Mr. Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSave your energy Rex, we\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d\n\nTwo months later, a Reuters headline blared that Mick Mulvaney, who then was Mr. Trump\u2019s new pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had decided to put \u201con ice\u201d sanctions against Wells Fargo for consumer abuses. It was little surprise: Mr. Mulvaney was an ally of the financial industry. But Mr. Trump had other ideas.\n\n\u201cFines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nPolitical appointees at the bureau wanted to affirm Mr. Trump\u2019s desire publicly, despite longstanding policies against commenting on active investigations, according to former officials there. A spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney issued a statement saying only that he \u201cshares the president\u2019s firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers.\u201d\n\nAccording to two people with direct knowledge of the Wells Fargo inquiry, career bureau officials took Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst as a green light to pursue aggressive negotiations with the bank, even as Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s team prepared to dial back penalties in other cases or shelve them. Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to a billion-dollar federal settlement, the bureau\u2019s largest-ever civil penalty.\n\nOver time, Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a means of presidential communication as vital as a statement from the White House press secretary or an Oval Office address. The press secretary has not held a daily on-camera press briefing \u2014 a decades-long ritual of presidential messaging \u2014 since March. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter activity drives the day.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has removed any doubt that his tweets carry the weight once reserved for more formal pronouncements.\n\nIn summer 2018, his aides repeatedly tried to reassure Republican lawmakers that the president backed their hard-line immigration bill, despite his remarks suggesting otherwise. But privately, Mr. Trump told several senators that there was only one certain sign of his support.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t tweet it,\u201d he said, according to two former senior advisers, \u201cdon\u2019t listen to my staff.\u201d\n\nAdapting a Platform\n\nWhen Mr. Trump entered office, aides were determined to rein in his itchy Twitter fingers.\n\nIn a series of informal conversations in early 2017, top White House officials discussed the possibility of a 15-minute delay on the president\u2019s account, a technical change not unlike the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks. But, one former senior official said, they quickly abandoned the idea after recognizing the political peril if it leaked to the press \u2014 or to their boss.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a trio of close advisers presented Mr. Trump with another idea. Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser; Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s director of strategic communications; and Rob Porter, his staff secretary, argued that they should see the tweets before he sent them out.\n\nMr. Trump was skeptical, worrying that delayed tweets would be irrelevant, according to a former White House official. But he agreed to a weeklong trial. Within 72 hours, the president had resumed tweeting from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.\n\nThree thousand miles away, in Silicon Valley, similar conversations were unfolding at Twitter\u2019s offices, where executives faced the same dilemma as Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle: whether, and how, to restrain him.\n\nAt the time, Twitter lagged far behind larger competitors like Facebook. While popular among politicians and journalists, it was struggling financially. But the president\u2019s incessant tweeting gave the company more currency.\n\nHis Twitter account often drove more \u201cimpressions\u201d \u2014 a key company metric \u2014 than any other in the world. But some of his messages seemed to violate the company\u2019s policies against abuse and incitement.\n\nMany of the president\u2019s tweets promoted conspiracy theories or tried to erode faith in democratic institutions. On his sixth day in office, he advanced the false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, depriving him of a popular-vote majority. He has tweeted 40 times about voter fraud and a \u201crigged\u201d electoral system. Less than a month into his presidency, Mr. Trump tweeted that Democrats made up Russian interference in the 2016 election to justify Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. He then accused Mr. Obama of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign. He has since sown doubt about Russian interference and the resulting investigations in more than 1,400 tweets. Mr. Trump has also used Twitter to attack the credibility of journalists, intelligence agencies and the judicial system. He has spoken of a nefarious \u201cdeep state\u201d undermining his presidency, a judiciary that puts the country in \u201cperil\u201d and a news media that is \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d a phrase historically used by autocrats. The president also pushed unfounded claims that Big Tech is biased against conservatives (102 tweets), stoked fears that caravans of migrants were going to \u201cinvade\u201d the United States (43 tweets), and questioned the number of people killed in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria (5 tweets). All told, Mr. Trump tweeted conspiratorial language more than 1,700 times.\n\nOn a now-defunct internal company message board known as Twitter Buzz, some left-leaning employees favored barring the president. Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior came up at almost every all-hands gathering and at many smaller meetings of executives. Some of them had set their phones to alert them whenever the president tweeted, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of confidentiality.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw was a company coming to grips with an entirely new situation, a new level of scrutiny, a new level of vitriol,\u201d said Dianna Colasurdo, a former account executive on Twitter\u2019s political advertising sales team, \u201cand working to adapt their policies in the moment to align with that.\u201d\n\nA turning point came in fall 2017, at the height of tensions with North Korea, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the rogue nation might not \u201cbe around much longer!\u201d The country\u2019s foreign minister called that a declaration of war. On Twitter, users wondered if the company would allow Mr. Trump to tweet his way into a nuclear conflict.\n\nThe response came the next day. Referring back to Mr. Trump\u2019s online declaration, Twitter announced in a tweet that it took \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d into account when evaluating whether to remove a post that violated its policies.\n\nIn an interview, Twitter executives said that newsworthiness had long figured into the company\u2019s internal enforcement guidelines and that officials there had been formulating the announcement, which applied worldwide, months before Mr. Trump\u2019s North Korea tweet. But former employees said they understood the announcement to be Trump-driven. Twitter did not want to be in the business of censoring the president.\n\nLate in summer 2018, White House insiders tried again to curb Mr. Trump\u2019s use of social media, according to two former aides. After a series of over-the-top weeks of tweeting \u2014 including calling Omarosa Manigault Newman, his onetime aide, \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201ca lowlife\u201d \u2014 several advisers suggested he go just two days without Twitter and see what happened. Mr. Trump nodded, and then promptly discarded the advice.\n\nMr. King, who said most of his Republican colleagues wished the president would tweet less, added that whenever he had raised the issue with White House staff members, they shrugged helplessly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop,\u201d he recalled their saying. \u201cForget it; we\u2019ve all tried.\u201d\n\nSoon enough, Mr. Trump was as prolific as ever.\n\nOn Sept. 13, he mocked Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, for claiming he could beat Mr. Trump in an election. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the aptitude or \u2018smarts\u2019 & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess,\u201d the president tweeted. Over the next 12 hours, Mr. Trump attacked two former F.B.I. officials, accused The Wall Street Journal of getting a tariff story wrong and blasted former Secretary of State John Kerry for holding \u201cillegal meetings\u201d with Iran.\n\n\u201cBAD!\u201d he wrote.\n\nFirst Things First\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter habit is most intense in the morning, when he is in the White House residence, watching Fox News, scrolling through his Twitter mentions and turning the social media platform into what one aide called the \u201cultimate weapon of mass dissemination.\u201d\n\nOf the attack tweets identified in the Times analysis, nearly half were sent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., hours that Mr. Trump spends mostly without advisers present.\n\nAfter waking early, Mr. Trump typically watches news shows recorded the previous night on his \u201cSuper TiVo,\u201d several DVRs connected to a single remote. (The devices are set to record \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d on Fox Business Network; \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Story With Martha MacCallum\u201d on Fox News; and \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d on CNN.)\n\nHe takes in those shows, and the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning program, then flings out comments on his iPhone. Then he watches as his tweets reverberate on cable channels and news sites.\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Mr. Trump and Fox News is apparent through the president\u2019s tweets. In fact, he praised the network in his first tweet on the first morning he woke up in the White House. He has since praised and promoted the network, individual shows and conservative news media personalities more than 750 times. Over all, at least 15 percent of the content in Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets seemed to come directly from Fox News and other conservative media outlets.\n\nEarly on Sept. 2 \u2014 the start of a week in which he tweeted 198 times \u2014 the president sent a few benign tweets, then lashed out at Paul Krugman as a \u201cFailing New York Times columnist\u201d who \u201cnever got it!\u201d Over the next 44 minutes, he fired off 10 more tweets. He disparaged Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. (\u201cLikes what we are doing until the cameras go on.\u201d) He called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and his \u201cdwindling group of friends\u201d liars and traitors. He railed against The Washington Post and four women of color in Congress who called themselves \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nAlmost every morning that week, Mr. Trump kicked off the day with an attack on one critic or another: the \u201cincompetent Mayor of London,\u201d or \u201cBad \u2018actress\u2019 Debra The Mess Messing\u201d \u2014 whom he accused of being racist \u2014 or the \u201cFake News Media.\u201d He referred to conservative media outlets 45 times, berated the mainstream media 32 times and tweeted about conspiracy theories 12 times.\n\nSometimes the president\u2019s apparent fury on Twitter is meant to troll his critics and get a rise out of them, many of his closest aides said. But they still brace themselves, knowing that they are likely to be blindsided by one of his tweets. Aides who gather for the early-morning staff meetings in the West Wing said their agenda was regularly blown up when their phones simultaneously went off with a tweet from the boss.\n\nOnce Mr. Trump arrives in the West Wing \u2014 usually after 10 a.m. \u2014 Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, takes control of the Twitter account, tweeting as @realDonaldTrump from his own phone or computer. Mr. Trump rarely tweets in front of others, those close to him say, because he does not like to wear the reading glasses he needs to see the screen.\n\nInstead, the president dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino, who sits in a closet-size room just off the Oval Office until Mr. Trump calls out \u201cScavino!\u201d Often, he prints out suggested tweets in extra-large fonts for the president to sign off on. (A single-page article that Mr. Scavino recently printed out for him ran to six pages after the fonts were enlarged, according to one person who saw it.)\n\nMr. Scavino\u2019s role in Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter machine has made him an unlikely White House power broker and the go-to person for aides, business executives, friends and lawmakers who want the president to tweet something. Ms. Conway noted what she called the hypocrisy of many Republicans who begged her to get Mr. Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign and now come to Mr. Scavino with suggestions. Mr. Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nHe sometimes acts as a brake \u2014 or tries to \u2014 on the president\u2019s tweeting impulses. When Mr. Trump started angrily posting about the \u201cSquad,\u201d Mr. Scavino told him it was a bad idea, according to an aide who witnessed the conversation. Along with Michael Dubke, who served as White House communications director for several months in 2017 and is from Buffalo, home of the famous chicken wings, Mr. Scavino presented some tweets to Mr. Trump in degrees of outrageousness: \u201chot,\u201d \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201cmild.\u201d Mr. Trump, said one former official who saw the proposed messages, always picked the most incendiary ones and often wanted to make them even more provocative.\n\nAnd while many of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets are shoot-from-the-hip attacks, he chews over others for days or even weeks, waiting for just the right moment to maximize the reaction, aides say.\n\nHe plotted for days to tweet about Mika Brzezinski, the liberal co-host of the popular MSNBC morning program, according to former White House officials, before finally posting one morning in June 2017. He called her \u201clow I.Q. Crazy Mika\u201d and wrote that she had been \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d during a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\n\nIn October of last year, the president started telling his aides that he planned to denounce Stormy Daniels, a pornographic-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him more than a decade earlier. He said he wanted to call her a \u201chorse face.\u201d\n\nSeveral current and former aides recalled telling Mr. Trump that it was a terrible idea and would renew accusations of misogyny against him. But he persisted.\n\nFinally, after watching a Fox News report days later about how a federal judge had thrown out a lawsuit by Ms. Daniels, the president tapped out the tweet.\n\n\u201cGreat, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA Love of \u2018Likes\u2019\n\nFor Mr. Trump, Twitter reinforces his instincts about his performance as president.\n\nAfter a rally in Dallas in mid-October, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides prepared a large-type printout of tweets gushing over his speech that day, including one from Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator and the host of a show on the Fox Nation site. Mr. Trump scrawled a thank-you note on one copy to Ms. Lahren \u2014 who then tweeted a picture of the letter back at the president.\n\nAides said they often compiled positive feedback for Mr. Trump. He revels in the stream of praise from his most loyal followers, on paper or as he scrolls through his phone early in the morning and late at night. He considers his following to be like the ratings on a TV show, better than any approval poll. After one weekend Twitter spree, the president told Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary at the time, he had expected a tweet he was particularly proud of to get more response than it did, according to a former administration official. Ms. Sanders said that if he tweeted 60 times, people wouldn\u2019t pay as much attention, the official said.\n\nTwitter vs. Reality The polling firm YouGov asks Americans to rate Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets every day.

Retweets and deleted tweets are not included in the analysis. \u00b7Source: YouGov\u00b7By The New York Times\n\nThe president is keenly aware of his number of followers and reluctant to acknowledge that any of them are not real. Mr. Trump has accused Twitter of political bias for its periodic purges of bot accounts across the platform, which have cost him \u2014 and other prominent users \u2014 hundreds of thousands of followers. When he met with the company\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in April, Mr. Trump reportedly pressed him at length about the lost followers.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter following may not be a reliable proxy for what the American people think of the job he is doing.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to determine with certainty how many of Mr. Trump\u2019s more than 66 million followers are fake. Some studies of his followers have estimated that a high proportion are likely to be automated bots, fake accounts or inactive. But even a conservative analysis by The Times found that nearly a third of them, about 22 million, included no biographical information and used the service\u2019s default profile image \u2014 two signs the accounts may be rarely used or inactive. Fourteen percent have automatically generated user names, another indication that an account may not belong to a real person.\n\nEven if Mr. Trump is not shouting into the void on Twitter, he is often preaching to the converted. Data from Stirista, an analytics firm, shows that his followers tend to be the kind of users who are most likely to be his supporters \u2014 disproportionately older, white and male compared with Twitter users over all.\n\nAnd they constitute just a fraction of the electorate. According to the Times analysis of Pew data, only about four percent of American adults, or about 11 million people, follow him on Twitter. Those followers represent less that one-fifth of his total, the analysis shows.\n\nAccording to data from YouGov, which polls about most of the president\u2019s tweets, some of the topics on which Mr. Trump got the most likes and retweets \u2014 jabs at the N.F.L., posts about the special counsel\u2019s investigation, unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud \u2014 poll poorly with the general public.\n\nBut people close to Mr. Trump said there was no dissuading him that the \u201clikes\u201d a tweet got were evidence that a decision or policy proposal was well received.\n\nLast December, after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw some troops from Syria, lawmakers came to the White House to argue against it. According to Politico, Mr. Trump responded by calling in Mr. Scavino.\n\n\u201cTell them how popular my policy is,\u201d Mr. Trump asked Mr. Scavino, who described for the lawmakers social media postings that had praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. Aides said that for Mr. Trump, his Twitter \u201clikes\u201d were proof that he had made the right call.\n\nThe reaction in the outside world was far less favorable. Within weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s defense secretary and the special anti-ISIS envoy quit over the decision. American allies were enraged. More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to rebuke Mr. Trump, who agreed under pressure to keep the troops in Syria.\n\nAlmost a year later, American troops in Syria became an issue again after Mr. Trump appeared to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria.\n\nThat resulted in another congressional rebuke for Mr. Trump and complaints even from loyal Republican allies. In subsequent days, Mr. Trump sought to defend himself on Twitter, alternately denying he had abandoned the Kurds and suggesting the United States had no stake in their safety, threatening Mr. Erdogan if the incursion continued and praising Turkey as an important trading partner.\n\nMany people took note of the back-and-forth, including Mr. Erdogan. \u201cWhen we take a look at Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts, we can no longer follow them,\u201d the Turkish president told reporters mockingly in mid-October, according to Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. \u201cWe cannot keep track.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Trump was not all negative. He also used Twitter to express admiration for people, from Aretha Franklin to Ryan Zinke. He often coupled his praise with a jab at someone else, or vice versa. He praised himself more than he did anyone else. All told, Mr. Trump sent 4,876 tweets that expressed approval or praise.\n\nA Tool for Re-Election\n\nIn the months ahead, the man tasked with winning Mr. Trump a second term is hoping to focus the president\u2019s Twitter habit on its original purpose: connecting with voters.\n\nBrad Parscale, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and is now campaign manager, has worked closely with Mr. Scavino to shape perceptions of the president through social media. The two men speak a half-dozen times a day, according to people familiar with their interactions.\n\nMr. Parscale criticized Twitter after it announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow paid political advertising on the platform, calling it \u201cyet another attempt to silence conservatives.\u201d But the change may benefit Mr. Trump: He has a far larger organic Twitter following than any of his likely Democratic opponents, and is therefore less reliant on paid ads to spread his message through the platform.\n\nWhile some campaign aides say Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets can be a distraction, they also view Twitter as an essential tool to present him as someone strong, willing to stand up to so-called political elites and what the president recently called the \u201cunholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake-news media.\u201d\n\nThe aides seek to cultivate the image of a man who understands \u201cregular people.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s team believes that his unvarnished writing, poor punctuation and increasing profanity on Twitter signal authenticity \u2014 a contrast to the polished, vetted, often anodyne social media style of most candidates.\n\nTwitter, Ms. Conway said, is the president\u2019s most potent weapon when it comes to bypassing the powerful people he believes have controlled the flow of information too long.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the democratization of information,\u201d she said. Everyone receives Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets at once \u2014 the stay-at-home mom, the plumber working on the sink, the billionaire executive, the White House correspondent.\n\n\u201cThey all hear \u2018ping,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cat the same time.\u201d",
