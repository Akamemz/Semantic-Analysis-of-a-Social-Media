    "content": "Mike Pence won . It was n't especially close in my book . A few thoughts :\n( 1 ) Kaine was peevish and annoying with his incessant interruptions , to which Pence responded calmly -- occasionally evincing forcefulness , at other times appearing amused . Donald Trump 's running mate also made a point of highlighting Kaine 's painfully rehearsed lines , mocking them gently -- and not so gently -- each time . On style , this was a clock-cleaning .\n( 2 ) On policy substance , Pence was fluid and prepared . Kaine was also familiar with his briefing book . It appeared as though Kaine was instructed to raise anti-Trump attack lines and talking points at every single opportunity . If that was his goal , mission accomplished . Others have made these observations , but I 'll amplify them : Kaine did not seem interested in winning this debate . He seemed interested in emptying his rhetorical clip of opposition research on the man at the top of his counterpart 's ticket . And Pence declined , repeatedly , to answer specific charges and challenges about things Trump has done and said . He made a choice not to defend the indefensible . These dynamics were 'sore-thumb ' obvious . A fair question some have asked : Was Pence so polished , informed , relaxed and smooth that he only accentuated the reality that Trump is none of those things ?\n( 3 ) While Kaine was constantly on offense against Trump , occasionally defending Mrs. Clinton with brief talking points , Pence picked his spots . He prosecuted a tough case against the Clinton Foundation 's foreign donations . He raised her email scandal on multiple occasions , including in the context of cyber security , where Trump whiffed last week . And over and over again , he would not let Kaine get away with the ridiculous claim that the Iran deal ended that anti-American regime 's nuclear program . It does nothing of the sort , and effectively guarantees that Iran will be a threshold nuclear state when the agreement 's restrictions automatically expire . Even President Obama has more or less admitted as much . Kaine kept advancing a mischaracterization , and Pence kept calling him on it . The Indiana Governor 's decision to go criticize Hillary Clinton 's extreme views on abortion was also a great move , especially since he underscored Kaine 's politically-motivated reversals on those questions , causing the Virginia Senator to squirm in his seat .\n( 4 ) The moderator was pilloried by viewers online throughout the evening , and I agree that she seemed inclined to cut Pence off as he was getting into the meat of Clinton 's various scandals . But in her defense , she repeatedly called Kaine out for interrupting and asked pointed , substantive questions of both candidates , including two queries pertaining to the national debt and entitlements . Maybe I 'm an outlier here , but I thought she was fine overall , even if she did n't pick her `` enforcement '' spots perfectly .\n( 5 ) I 'm not sure any of this matters . This election is the Trump and Clinton show , and while Pence was effective at prosecuting a tough case against the Democratic nominee and ( sometimes painfully ) side-stepping challenges about Trump 's long rap sheet of statements , Kaine remained relentlessly on-message as an attack dog . That may have frustrated and turned off many viewers , but negativity works . If Donald Trump wants to reverse the self-inflicted negative momentum he 's experiencing in this race , he 's going to have to do so himself on Sunday . Pence passed this test with flying colors , but he 's not the man in the spotlight . The Hoosier State Republican did everything he could to help his ticket , and he may have created a favorable and stabilizing impression , but the undercard debate can not and will not be decisive .
