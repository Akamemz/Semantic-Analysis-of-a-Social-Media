    "content_original": "Obama counting on ground game\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s campaign is confident that its ground game will produce the winning margin in November \u2014 but while they\u2019re well ahead of Mitt Romney, things are a lot tougher than they were in 2008.\n\nThe race is tighter. Enthusiasm is lower. Canvassers face voters disappointed in Obama\u2019s first term. Phone bankers find undecideds seriously considering a vote for Mitt Romney. And they\u2019re facing competition from a joint Romney-Republican National Committee operation that\u2019s deeper and more robust than what John McCain put together four years ago.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a race this tight, the Obama campaign sees its operation delivering wins in Ohio and other key swing states. Advisers to the president are confident that as long as the polls stay tight, Obama will win \u2014 even though the campaign won\u2019t say much about its operations, arguing it doesn\u2019t want to reveal too much to opponents.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama kicks off blitz in Iowa, Colorado)\n\n\u201cThe best field operation generally can put an extra 2 or 3 points on the board,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic grass-roots consultant. \u201cWhoever has the best field program, that could be the difference.\u201d\n\nEven as the Republican efforts are posting milestone numbers, the Obama campaign won\u2019t say anything beyond pointing to what campaign manager Jim Messina cited in his Democratic National Convention speech as he explained how much further ahead they were than 2008: 44 million phone calls, 3.8 million door knocks and one million new voter registrations.\n\nThe Romney-RNC numbers by last Saturday are larger: 45 million voter contacts by last Saturday \u2014 up from the 24 million Bush-Cheney 2004 benchmark. They say they\u2019ve knocked on 9 million doors \u2014 three times more than at the same point in 2008. But that total includes knocks that went unanswered, where volunteers left pamphlets for residents, which the Obama campaign doesn\u2019t include in its totals.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama\u2019s 11th hour strategy shift)\n\nNone of the claims on numbers of contacts by either campaign can be independently verified.\n\nIn terms of volunteers, the Romney-RNC ground operation says 119,000 volunteers have been active since the spring. The Obama campaign won\u2019t say how they\u2019re doing compared to the 1.5 million they had in 2008.\n\nThe Obama campaign also points to an email list of tens of millions and a network of volunteers in at least the hundreds of thousands. A constant stream of large campaign events \u2014 rallies for thousands featuring the president and, this week, concerts headlined by Bruce Springsteen and Bill Clinton \u2014 bring in more data.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Hadas Gold @ 10/24/2012 11:10 PM CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article provided some outdated early voting counts.",
