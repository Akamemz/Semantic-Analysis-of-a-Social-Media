That may mean taxpayers could n't file until late March , Miller said .\nIncome exemption levels under the `` wealth tax '' -- as the AMT is known -- were never adjusted for inflation since it was enacted decades ago . So Congress has regularly passed an AMT `` patch '' to correct for that by raising the exemption levels .\nOnly problem is they have failed to do so for this tax year .\nAs a result , roughly 28 million taxpayers will face much bigger than expected tax bills or much smaller refunds when they file their 2012 returns next year .\nBy contrast , if Congress gets its act together and passes a patch by Dec. 31 , only 5 million people would be subject to the AMT when they file next year .\n`` The major victims of the impending expanded reach of the AMT are large families living in high-tax states , '' Joseph Minarik , a former White House chief economist , wrote in the blog Back in the Black .\nThat 's because such families benefit from two key tax breaks that are disallowed under the AMT : personal exemptions and itemized deductions for state and local taxes .\n`` Those families do not need enormous incomes to be caught by this monster -- $ 75,000 is more than enough under the right circumstances .
