Joseph Kennedy III has announced that he plans to exploit the Facebook privacy scandal in a thinly veiled attempt to establish government control over the internet : \u201c When you see lapses like that , it opens the door for Congress to get involved\u2026 and make sure people \u2019 s information is safeguarded. \u201d You can bet that , once Kennedy and his Democratic accomplices are permitted to \u201c get involved , \u201d they won \u2019 t limit their meddling to social media . So , before putting federal apparatchiks in charge of protecting our internet information , it \u2019 s worth taking a look at their own cybersecurity record . It is predictably abysmal .\nIn one case , for example , a security breach at the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) compromised sensitive personal information on more than 22 million federal employees . An investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform resulted in a scathing report documenting that the breach was caused by the incompetence for which the federal bureaucracy is notorious . The report also concluded that it was exacerbated by the gross negligence of OPM \u2019 s leadership , who ignored repeated warnings over several years from the Inspector General concerning inadequate security :\nThe longstanding failure of OPM \u2019 s leadership to implement basic cyber hygiene\u2026 despite years of warnings from the Inspector General , represents a failure of culture and leadership , not technology . As OPM discovered in April 2015 , tools were available that could have prevented the breaches , but OPM failed to leverage those tools to mitigate the agency \u2019 s extensive vulnerabilities .\nWas the OPM breach unique within the federal bureaucracy ? Nope . Nor was it a new phenomenon . The Veterans Health Administration experienced a breach in 2006 involving the medical records of no fewer than 26.5 million patients .

The sad reality is that the government is no better at cyber security than it is at anything else . The Heritage Foundation reports , \u201c In 2016 , government agencies reported 30,899 information-security incidents , 16 of which met the threshold of being a major incident . \u201d\nAll of which raises the following question : Does Rep. Kennedy actually believe that giving federal bureaucrats oversight powers involving Facebook or any other internet entity will improve privacy or render your personal data more secure ? Even he isn \u2019 t that dumb . His agenda has nothing to do with making sure anyone \u2019 s information is \u201c safeguarded. \u201d It \u2019 s about self-promotion . He will use this week \u2019 s appearance by Mark Zuckerberg before the House Energy and Commerce Committee as a platform for enhancing his standing within the Democratic Party .

It is rather the use of their data by the Trump presidential campaign to target advertising . Never mind that it was the 2012 Obama campaign that pioneered the unauthorized exploitation of Facebook data . As Investors Business Daily reports :\nIn 2012 , the Obama campaign encouraged supporters to download an Obama 2012 Facebook app that , when activated , let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends\u2026 more than a million people downloaded the app , which , given an average friend-list size of 190 , means that as many as 190 million had at least some of their Facebook data vacuumed up by the Obama campaign \u2014 without their knowledge or consent .\nOddly enough , that somehow failed to result in congressional hearings .
