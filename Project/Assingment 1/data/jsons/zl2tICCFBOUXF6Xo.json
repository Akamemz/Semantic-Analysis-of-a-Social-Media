Congressional Republicans have protected Wall Street from the tiniest of tax increases \u2014 leaving in place narrowly tailored provisions that have enriched hedge fund managers and kept bank profits high . New taxes were unthinkable .\nBut as Camp \u2019 s Ways and Means Committee sought to slash tax rates , it \u2019 s easy to see how banks with more than $ 500 billion in assets \u2014 mammoth institutions like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup \u2014 became an easy target .\nTax reform is extraordinarily unlikely to pass in 2014 , but this provision has sparked a back-room Washington battle between Republicans and Wall Street in the middle of an election year . Even if this efforts falls by the wayside , a new tax on big financial institutions will be a permanent fixture when the government is looking for fresh sources of revenue .\nSome Republicans privately concede that after the recession and bank bailout , the relationship between Republicans and some parts of the financial sector has changed . One House Republican said the party is \u201c fed up with the big banks \u2019 incessant desire for [ government ] help , funds , rules to help them , etc. \u201d Others say that the tax hikes on banks is an attempt to capture some elusive Democratic support for Camp \u2019 s tax plan . In fact , the plan is similar to something President Barack Obama proposed to try to recapture bailout money from banks . It also has a whiff of the populism Democrats have used in recent years .\nBut Camp \u2019 s proposal is unlikely to get much Democratic support . And more importantly , the plan is already causing deep splits within the Republican party , laying bare fundamental disagreements about how the GOP should write rules for the financial services industry .\nOn one side are Camp \u2019 s allies , who say the proposed tax on big banks is akin to an insurance policy for any future bailouts . These Republicans believe Democratic Wall Street reform encourages more government bailouts . If banks get in trouble and need government assistance , they argue that the banks wouldn \u2019 t be relying on taxpayer money , but rather their own.The politics of this are rich : a strain of populism is seeping into some GOP quarters .\nIn the other corner , however , are conservatives who insist any new fee on banks is a tax hike that will be passed onto consumers . Financial Services Committee members like Reps. Patrick McHenry ( R-N.C. ) , Spencer Bachus ( R-Ala. ) and Steve Stivers ( R-Ohio ) have been working behind the scenes , trying to stop what they dub a wrong-headed policy .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve got enormous respect for Dave Camp but I just disagree with taxing lending and that \u2019 s what this is , \u201d McHenry told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Tuesday evening . \u201c Functionally , a tax on bank assets is a tax on lending . That \u2019 s all there is to it . And if you \u2019 re going to have an assessment quarterly , at a time when the American people are starved for capital , you \u2019 re taxing lending capital . So it runs counter to our economic needs . \u201d\nBachus , the former Financial Services Committee chairman , along with fellow Alabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne , went as far as to pen a private letter Tuesday to Camp saying their \u201c view is that taxes such as the special bank tax once proposed by President Obama are highly detrimental to lending and capital formation and as such we oppose them . \u201d\nThe immediate impact for Wall Street is limited , since this tax plan is certain to go nowhere fast .\nBut on K Street , Wall Street and Capitol Hill , there \u2019 s a palpable concern that Camp has forever changed the relationship between Washington and big banks . In this new world , slapping new taxes on banks is fair game \u2014 even for Republicans , who have shunned tax increases for decades .\nThe House Republican leadership has not yet weighed in on the details of this plan . This is not a fight they are relishing in the middle of an election year . Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R-Va. ) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) all raise piles of money from Wall Street and their reaction will be watched closely by industry insiders .\n\u201c Tax reform is hard , \u201d one House Republican aide said . \u201c This is why nobody likes to put these specifics on a piece of paper \u2014 you have to [ screw ] somebody . There \u2019 s a magical belief among some of our members that you can lower the rate to 25 percent by just eliminating unpopular deductions . The math doesn \u2019 t work . You have to end up [ screwing ] somebody . \u201d\nThe tax appears to only affect a handful of the largest banks , according to sources . Those institutions including JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley . Some large financial firms outside the banking industry , including GE Capital , AIG and Prudential Financial , would also be affected by the tax .\nThe financial services industry is concerned that the proposed tax is punitive \u2014 the policy singles out an industry for punishment . Cam Fine , the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America , even fears that this opens the door to new taxes on small banks , who are not affected by this provision . He said his organization will fight this tax \u201c right alongside the larger banks . \u201d\n\u201c This idea of taxing just a segment of the banking industry , regardless of the size of the bank , is just wrong-headed tax policy , \u201d he said . \u201c There is no reason to do this except for punitive purposes . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c Nobody is going to accuse me of being in love with Wall Street , but wrong is wrong , and this just happens to be wrong . \u201d\nWednesday morning , the knives began coming out . Steve Judge , the president and CEO of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council , said in a statement Camp \u201c chose to single out private equity , real estate , and venture capital investment by exacting a 40 percent tax increase that will discourage new investment . \u201d\n\u201c It is our hope that as the debate over tax reform unfolds , policymakers will utilize the opportunity to reform the tax code as a way to encourage , not undermine , capital investment in America , \u201d Judge said in a statement .\nThe tax draft isn \u2019 t only sparking ideological divides , but also regional politics are rearing their head \u2014 banking centers like Chicago and New York are shuddering over the possibility of the tax , sources say .\nNew York Rep. Pete King \u2014 one of the remaining Republicans from the New York City area \u2014 has expressed opposition to the bank tax portion of Camp \u2019 s plan .\n\u201c I would think a number of other folks from New York would oppose it too , \u201d King said . He added , \u201c I \u2019 m afraid if it \u2019 s on the table , it \u2019 s going to be out there for future debates . I just think it \u2019 s a bad idea . And as Republicans \u2013 I don \u2019 t see why we \u2019 re trying to increase peoples \u2019 taxes . \u201d\nThis is not necessarily the narrative GOP leaders were seeking this week . On the House floor , Republicans are passing a number of regulatory and government reform bills .\nThe leadership has held this tax plan at arm \u2019 s length , framing it as a draft from a chairman who has longed to rewrite the tax code . Many senior Republicans \u2014 both in leadership and lawmakers on Camp \u2019 s Ways and Means Committee \u2014 said they hadn \u2019 t seen a draft of the bill , and couldn \u2019 t comment . Many of those same figures have privately tried to distance themselves from the draft .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had conversations with a number of representatives who have washed their hands of this , \u201d a financial services industry executive told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c who have said \u2018 this is not a Republican proposal , this is the Dave Camp proposal . \u2019 \u201d\nOf course , the damage to Wall Street \u2019 s relationship with Republicans will be limited if most of the party lambasts this proposal as expected . But it \u2019 s now forever on the menu of options when D.C. is looking for fresh revenue .\n\u201c This will be an eternal item that \u2019 s always on the shelf for members that are trying to raise revenue for any one thing , \u201d said one D.C.-based banking lobbyist . \u201c Because once it \u2019 s in there , it \u2019 s in there . It \u2019 ll be used by both Republicans and Democrats going forward as a way to raise revenue regardless of what the offsets might be . \u201d",
