    "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump is facing a critical test in the final six weeks of the primary season : securing the 1,237 delegates needed to finally claim the Republican presidential nomination as his own .\nThe prospect of a historic contested convention has surrounded Trump 's candidacy for months . But Trump is much closer to winning the nomination outright following his resounding victories in Tuesday 's East Coast primaries , which boosted his delegate count to at least 988 compared to 568 for his chief rival , Ted Cruz .\nTrump needs to win 49 % of the remaining Republican delegates to capture the nomination , according to CNN estimates . He 's been winning delegates so far at a rate of 49 % , making that target well within reach .\nStill , he is facing headwinds as the primary calendar winds down : both in the newly forged alliance between Cruz and Ohio Gov . John Kasich and the complex political terrain in Indiana and California will determine whether Trump can win the nomination outright . Cruz is also making a last-ditch effort to revitalize his campaign by saying Wednesday that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate if he won the GOP nomination .\nThe major primary contests will be more spread out over the next month as the primary calendar expands west to Indiana , Nebraska , Oregon and Washington State before culminating in the June 7 contests that include New Mexico , New Jersey and California .\nIt is unclear , however , whether Trump 's team has built the organization to pull off the kinds of margins that he will need in logistically complex states like California\u2014where the candidates are competing for 172 delegates in 53 different congressional districts .\nDespite leadership changes in his campaign and the expansion of his once skeletal staff , Trump 's campaign has been repeatedly outmatched by Cruz 's superior organization in the parallel campaign to identify , vet and elect loyal delegates who would stand by him through successive rounds of ballots at an open convention if Trump did n't clinch the support of 1,237 delegates on the first ballot .\nAt the same time , it is too early to tell whether the Cruz-Kasich gambit to split up Indiana , Oregon and New Mexico\u2014essentially agreeing not to compete against one another in those states\u2014will succeed or backfire , particularly at a time when many Republican voters are demonstrating their frustration with GOP establishment at the ballot box .\n`` Strategic voting and strategic campaigning is the only way to keep him from reaching 1,237 , '' said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , an ardent Trump critic who is backing Cruz . The question is whether `` it will be clear to Kasich people in Indiana that they have to vote for Cruz to stop Trump , '' he said .\n`` If they can execute this , '' Graham said , `` I think it stops him . ''\nTrump argued Tuesday night that the alliance is just another sign of his rivals ' `` tremendous weakness '' and the establishment 's collusion against him .\n`` I consider myself the presumptive nominee , '' Trump said in his victory speech in New York .\n`` It 's over , '' he said , stating that Cruz and Kasich made a mistake with their `` faulty deal . ''\nTrump and Cruz demonstrated their starkly different strategies for this closing stretch of the race on Wednesday .\nTrump , who has been striving to appear more presidential , delivered a blistering attack of President Barack Obama 's foreign policy during a formal speech in Washington .\nIn an effort to improve his standing among Republicans and party elites who question his credentials to be President , Trump adopted a serious tone as he outlined his foreign policy views and said the `` overriding theme '' of his administration would be putting American interests first .\nCruz , by contrast , adopted an almost-Trump-like tactic to try to regain control of the news cycle after his bruising losses Tuesday night . He announced at an afternoon event in Indianapolis that if he were nominated , he would choose Fiorina , the former Hewlett-Packard CEO , as his running mate .\nThe splashy announcement was intended to give a much needed jolt of energy to his campaign \u2014 amplifying his argument that he would be better suited to take on Hillary Clinton , particularly with Fiorina at his side .\nIn the near term , Cruz is pinning his hopes squarely on next week 's contest in Indiana . Before Trump 's East Coast wins had even been called on Tuesday night , Cruz predicted that `` the media '' would say `` the race is over '' and that `` Donald Trump is the Republican nominee . ''\nBut the Texas senator pointed to his prospects in western states beyond Indiana \u2014 Nebraska , North Dakota , Montana , Washington and California \u2014 as spots where he could slow down Trump 's momentum .\nCruz clearly hopes that asking Fiorina to join his potential ticket will give him an added boost in California , where Fiorina unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. Senate seat against Barbara Boxer in 2010 . Though Fiorina was popular among Republicans in California , she was widely viewed as a flawed candidate because of her mixed business record at HP , which also became a liability in her recent presidential campaign .\nThe anti-Trump forces have signaled vigorous efforts ahead to try to weaken Trump in Indiana and California .
