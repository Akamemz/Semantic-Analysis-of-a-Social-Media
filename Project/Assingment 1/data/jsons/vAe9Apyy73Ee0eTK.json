While Republicans in Congress have not unified by a single alternative to Obamacare , a building block of virtually every proposal in circulation is to equalize the tax treatment of employer-sponsored insurance and individual insurance\u2014which , in layman \u2019 s terms , means making it much more appealing for somebody who gets coverage on the job to buy coverage on his or her own . Typically these proposals would allow insurers selling individual coverage to continue some of their current practices , like charging higher premiums or refusing to cover certain services for people with pre-existing conditions , or offering coverage with serous gaps in benefits . Most experts believe such reforms would hike the cost of employer plans , as only sicker people remained on them , potentially creating a \u201c death spiral \u201d that would lead to fewer employers offering plans .
