J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\nA LITTLE HELP ON THE HILL : Another day , another set of meetings on Capitol Hill . ABC 's Mary Bruce notes that today President Obama makes his third and final trip to the Capitol this week . At 12:45 p.m . ET he meets with the Senate Republican conference , followed by a 2:15 p.m . ET meeting with the House Democrats . This afternoon Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at a welcome ceremony for Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel at the Pentagon .\nWHY BUDGETS ARE LIKE DREAMS : ABC 's Chris Good notes that when conservative House Republicans and liberal Democrats in the House Progressive Caucus each released their broad budget plans this week , what we really saw was a window into two drastically different visions of the future . Republicans , led by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan , issued a 91-page doctrine of fiscal conservatism that claims to balance the budget in 10 years . The House Progressive Caucus , led by Reps. Raul Grijalva , D-Ariz. , and Keith Ellison , D-Minn. , released their own 19-page blueprint that lowers the deficit ( but does n't eliminate it ) by raising taxes while pumping investments into all the infrastructure , education , and public welfare programs liberals love . It 's a tale of two budgets , and America 's alternate futures could n't be more different . Read more : http : //abcn.ws/X9H3r5\nA PAPAL WELCOME FROM THE WHITE HOUSE : President Obama yesterday issued the following statement after the election of Pope Francis : `` On behalf of the American people , Michelle and I offer our warm wishes to His Holiness Pope Francis as he ascends to the Chair of Saint Peter and begins his papacy . As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us , he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than two thousand years-that in each other we see the face of God . As the first pope from the Americas , his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world , and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans , those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day . ''\nABC 's JONATHAN KARL : Talk about white smoke : I am told , by Republican sources , that President Obama got standing ovations at the beginning and end of his meeting yesterday with House Republicans on Capitol Hill - his first such meeting in four years . There were tough questions and no breakthroughs , but a source inside the closed-door meeting called it `` very cordial '' and told me that virtually every House Republican who stood up to ask a question began by saying , `` Thank you for coming '' and `` You are welcome here anytime . '' Some added , `` We need to work together . '' The biggest laugh line : The president informed the group that there was white smoke at the Vatican , and Rep. Billy Long of Missouri yelled out , `` Does that mean the White House is open for tours ? '' Obama responded : `` No , but the Vatican is . '' This was Obama 's first visit to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans in four years . He has met with them a total of four times , the most recent being at the White House 2011 . Here 's more about yesterday 's big meeting : http : //abcn.ws/Ybx2ts\nABC 's RICK KLEIN : There they will all be ( mostly ) in one place , several generations lost about the next race . Perhaps the only thing attendees at this year 's Conservative Political Action Conference can agree on is the `` conservative '' label . Beyond that , question about who 's not there ( Chris Christie , Bob McDonnell , GOP gay-rights groups ) are competing with questions about who is ( lots of future stars , sure , though nobody figures to get more coverage than Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin ) . Attention and talk will turn to 2016 , including the straw poll winner who almost certainly wo n't be the party nominee . But of more immediate concern to the gathered conservative flock is how attendees interact with their allies on Capitol Hill . The red meat is set to be served at the first time in the Obama presidency that Republicans are breaking bread with the president . The message coming from CPAC is highly unlikely to involve bargains with President Obama , grand or otherwise .\nABC 's DEVIN DWYER : Behind closed doors , deep in the Capitol crypt , President Obama on Wednesday offered a rare glimpse at his conflicted feelings ahead of a final decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline . Obama said his ruling on the project would come `` soon , '' according to House Republican sources in the meeting . But despite some recent signs and speculation that he may be inclined to green-light the deal , Obama reportedly recited a litany of reasons to reject it . `` He said there were no permanent jobs , and that the oil will be put on ships and exported and that the only ones who are going to get wealthy are the Canadians , '' Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told AP . Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana , another pipeline supporter , said Obama also questioned overall job-creation estimates for pipeline construction , saying it `` is not going to create as many jobs as you hope . '' The president is expected to receive a formal recommendation on the project from the State Department later this spring . Then it 's all up to him .\nABC 's ARLETTE SAENZ : The Senate Judiciary Committee considers its final gun measure - the assault weapons ban - today . But if the controversial bill passes committee , likely on a party-line vote , it faces an uphill battle in the full Senate just like the background check bill the committee voted for on Tuesday . If they want any chance to pass the Senate , both bills will require changes in language in order to get Republicans and moderate Democrats on board . And will President Obama step in to help push the bills through ? The president , who has focused on the budget and sequester in recent weeks , has remained relatively silent on guns while the measures have been developed and debated in committee , instead deploying Vice President Joe Biden to make the pitch on guns . At least one leading Democrat on the gun front wants more assistance from the president . `` I 'd like to see everybody doing more , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , sponsor of the assault weapons ban , told the AP when asked if she 'd like to see the president help out more . `` Yes , absolutely , we need help . ''\nABC 's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE : How involved will the president be in the 2014 political cycle ? According to at least one top Democrat he 's already helping . At a presentation to Democratic allies and the press Wednesday , Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel , D-N.Y. , had this to say : `` He made commitments that he would help us raise the resources we need , '' Israel said . `` The White House is very good on the president 's commitment\u2026And the president is very good on the president 's commitment . '' Israel added that President Obama has asked the DCCC to `` keep him apprised on some of our recruiting priorities and we 've been sharing that information with the White House and they have been very receptive . '' More on Israel 's remarks : http : //abcn.ws/ZIXnAw\n`` OBAMA 'S OUTREACH IS NICE , BUT WHERE 'S THE LEADERSHIP ? '' a Washington Post Op-Ed by House Speaker John Boehner . `` So it was a good meeting . House Republicans welcomed the chance for a frank exchange of ideas with President Obama on Wednesday . Outreach is always positive , and more Republicans in this town need the opportunity to have an open dialogue with our president . I hope these discussions continue . Yet , while this may have been the first time some of my colleagues have heard the president 's arguments so personally and directly , I 've heard them all many times before . If we 're going to find bipartisan solutions , the president will have to move beyond the same proposals and Democratic dogma . For all of Washington 's focus on the president 's outreach to Republicans , it 's his engagement with members of his own party that will determine whether we succeed in dealing with the challenges facing our economy . '' http : //wapo.st/Z3oo2G\n-THE FUTURE , ACCORDING TO THE GOP : Under Paul Ryan 's plan , most people take some kind of a hit , and the government survives to serve future generations because it 's restrained in the near term , reports ABC 's Chris Good . Tax reform lowers rates on people and corporations ( including high incomes ) while stripping out deductions and credits . National defense remains fully funded , but Medicare is essentially voucherized for people turning 55 now ; Medicare survives and health-care costs are restrained , as patients turn down unnecessary procedures , saving the system from fiscal ruin . Medicare is block-granted , giving states more flexibility to do with the funds as they please . `` Obamacare '' is repealed , meaning no one has to buy health insurance , but also that the government spends a lot less helping people buy it . Tort reform means doctors do n't get sued as often , the government only gives welfare to people meeting the full set of work requirements ; job-training programs and `` career scholarships '' help people get to work , and the federal government accounts more accurately for the money it loans out . http : //abcn.ws/X9H3r5\n-THE FUTURE , ACCORDING TO DEMOCRATS : In the future according to the House Progressive Caucus , the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone making over $ 250,000 , and millionaires and billionaires see their tax rates jump from 45 percent . The federal government invests more in infrastructure , creating jobs , and unemployment claims can be made for almost two years ( 99 weeks ) . A public-option health system is adopted , while no benefits are cut in Medicare , Medicaid , or Social Security . Generic drugs become more available , as name-brand drug companies are barred from paying generic makers to delay sales in patent settlements . States receive more money through block grants to hire police , firefighters , and teachers , and states also get more money for Medicaid . A new cap-and-trade system limits greenhouse-gas emissions on a large scale . Corporate tax credits that can benefit oil and gas production are rolled back . America swiftly withdraws from Afghanistan , eliminating emergency war funding and saving billions from the federal budget , while the military cuts contractors , spends less on bases , and slowly shrinks its force through attrition . http : //abcn.ws/X9H3r5\nCPAC PRIMER : Today marks the start of a three-day gathering of conservative leaders and activists from around the country . The Conservative Political Action Conference - CPAC , for short - is organized by the American Conservative Union and has become an annual focal point bringing together establishment figures , new leaders , grassroots types and , in particular , the younger generation of conservatives . It kicks off this morning at the Gaylord National Hotel in National Harbor , Md . just outside Washington , DC .\n-WHO 'S GOING : A whole lot of big-name speakers like Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin , Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio , Donald Trump , Rick Perry , Bobby Jindal , Newt Gingrich , Michele Bachmann , Rick Santorum , Paul Ryan Rand Paul and many more . Numerous other lawmakers from Capitol Hill will also address the gathering and attendees will also have a chance to hear from a host of unelected officials who have a prominent role on policy and other matters within the conservative orbit : the National Rifle Association 's Wayne LaPierre , American Crossroads head Steven Law , American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas , Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist and Heritage Foundation president and former U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint .\n-WHO 'S NOT GOING : The two most-talked-about names who do n't have speaking slots at this year 's CPAC conference are New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell ( although McDonnell plans to participate in a prayer breakfast associated with the conference on Friday morning ) . American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas did not mince words about why Christie was not invited this year : `` This past year he strongly advocated for the passage of a $ 60-plus billion pork barrel bill , containing only $ 9 billion in disaster assistance and he signed up with the federal government to expand Medicaid at a time when his state can ill afford it , so he was not invited to speak \u2026 Hopefully he will be back in top form next year . We would be delighted to invite him again in that case . '' Nevertheless , the exclusion of politicians like Christie and McDonnell and the inclusion of someone like Donald Trump has already led some conservative pundits to declare that `` CPAC is dead . '' There are other big names who will be absent too , including House Speaker John Boehner , Arizona senator and former GOP nominee John McCain , New Mexico Gov . Susana Martinez and more . ABC 's Chris Good compiled a list of the `` 13 Top Republican You Wo n't See At CPAC '' : http : //abcn.ws/WmHmBu\n-MITT 'S MOMENT : Mitt Romney has chosen this year 's conference as the venue for his first major speech since losing the 2012 election . He offered a preview of his post-election thoughts during a recent interview on Fox News Sunday , but his remarks to the gathering ( scheduled for 1 p.m . ET on Friday ) will be his chance to set a tone for his future role within the Republican Party . Everyone will be watching to see whether he focuses on lessons learned from 2012 , what he would be doing differently if he were in the White House , his vision for the future or all of the above . Recall that in his Mar . 3 Fox interview , he said : `` As the guy who lost the election , I 'm not in a position to tell everyone else how to win , '' but added : `` I 'm not going to disappear . '' Notably , CPAC is something of a fraught venue for Romney . It was at the same conference in 2008 that he dropped out of that year 's Republican presidential primary . And last year it was at CPAC where he declared himself `` a severely conservative Republican governor '' - a comment that did not win him much praise on the right .\n-ON THE LIGHTER SIDE : CPAC is not just about serious speechmaking and politicking . This year 's conference , for example , features a panel called `` Fight Club 2013 , '' a debate between liberal heavyweight Paul Begala and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson . There 's another panel titled : `` How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Plastic Water Bottles , Fracking , Genetically Modified Food , and Big Gulp Sodas , '' and yet another called `` Getting Hollywood Right . '' One attendee has even released a helpful guide for fellow conference-goers , `` What to Wear at CPAC '' ( business suits , button-downs , pumps and loafers are in ; rompers , halter-tops , tee-shirts and Tom 's shoes are out ) . And the nightlife should prove interesting too : on Friday , for example , CPAC is hosting what they are calling the Obama Zombie Apocalypse Party . The motto : `` First they come for your brains , then they come for your ballots . ''\nMCCONNELL AD TARGETS WOMEN . There 's nothing like getting a head start . His re-election contest may be 20 months away , but Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , possibly fearing an Ashley Judd candidacy , already has an ad targeted specifically at women voters that will run this week in his home state . ABC 's Shushannah Walshe reports that the ad , which includes a television , radio and online component , includes McConnell 's wife , former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao , looking directly into the camera as she criticizes `` far left special interests . '' `` You 've seen the ads attacking my husband , '' Chao says in the 30-second spot , which will begin running Thursday in Lexington and Louisville . `` As Mitch McConnell 's wife , I 've learned to expect them . Now , far-left special interests are also attacking my ethnicity , even attacking Mitch 's patriotism , because he 's married to me . '' Chao is hitting back after a group called Progress Kentucky , a super PAC aimed at defeating McConnell , posted tweets last month that highlighted Chao 's Chinese ancestry . After first defending the tweets , criticism from both sides of the aisle ( including possible candidate Judd ) led them to apologize and delete the tweets . http : //abcn.ws/WaUs69\n@ newtgingrich : The Obama proposal to reopen only for school groups is absurd .
