Slager has 14 days to appeal the sentence .\nIn a sentencing mini-trial that commenced on Monday , federal prosecutors and Slager \u2019 s defense attorneys presented evidence to sway Norton \u2019 s views about Slager \u2019 s culpability on the day he shot and killed 50-year-old Scott during a traffic stop gone bad . Prosecutors had argued that Slager committed second-degree murder , while the defense claimed his offense was , at most , voluntary manslaughter .\nAfter the judge ruled that Slager would face a murder penalty , members of Scott \u2019 s family addressed the court .
