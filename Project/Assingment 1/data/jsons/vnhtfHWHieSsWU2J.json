Economists surveyed by CNNMoney had expected the report to show 158,000 jobs were added in May .\nMeanwhile , the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6 % from 7.5 % in April . That minor rise came as 420,000 people joined the labor force -- an encouraging sign that some formerly discouraged workers may be re-starting their job searches .\nBusinesses are citing concerns about the cost of health care reform rules , set to go into effect next year , as a major unknown keeping them on the edge .\n`` Fear of not knowing exactly what the rules are is holding hiring back , '' said John Silvia , Wells Fargo chief economist . `` Once everybody knows the rules , they 'll all want to play the game . ''\nUncertainties also surround the broader economic impact from across-the-board government budget cuts underway now , and weakness in foreign economies like China and Europe , which is subduing demand for U.S. goods and services abroad . These concerns are leading firms to prefer temporary or part-time workers , said Scot Melland , CEO of Scot Melland , CEO of Dice Holdings ( DHX ) , a company that runs several job search sites .\n`` Companies have work they still need to get done , but they do n't have enough confidence in the forward-look of their business to make those full-time positions , '' he said .\nIndeed , the monthly jobs report showed a gain of 25,600 temporary jobs in May .\nRestaurants and bars added 38,000 jobs .
