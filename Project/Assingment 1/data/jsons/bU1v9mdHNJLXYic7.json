    "content": "The claim that the fatal 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks were sparked by an anti-Muslim video was crafted in Washington by Obama administration appointees and reflected neither eyewitness nor real-time reports from the Americans under siege , according to the final report of the GOP-led Benghazi Select Committee .\nThe GOP report , released Tuesday , followed by less than a day a report by the Democrats on the panel saying that security at the Benghazi , Libya facility was \u201c woefully inadequate \u201d but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton never personally denied any requests from diplomats for additional protection .\nAccording to portions of the Republican report reviewed by Fox News , one U.S. agent at the American outpost in Benghazi , whose name was withheld for security reasons , told the committee he first heard \u201c some kind of chanting . \u201d\nThen that sound was immediately followed by \u201c explosions \u201d and \u201c gunfire , then roughly 70 people rushing into the compound with an assortment of \u201c AK-47s , grenades , RPG \u2019 s \u2026 a couple of different assault rifles , \u201d the agent said .\nIn addition , a senior watch officer at the State Department 's diplomatic security command described the Sept. 11 , 2012 , strikes as `` a full on attack against our compound . \u201d\nWhen asked whether he saw or heard a protest prior to the attacks , the officer replied , `` zip , nothing , nada , '' according to the Republican majority report .\n\u201c None of the information coming directly from the agents on the ground in Benghazi during the attacks mentioned anything about a video or a protest .
