Chuck Schumer , D-New York , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-California , expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $ 1 million or more , a higher threshold than the $ 250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama .\nEventually , Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president 's position . But the $ 1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement .\nA number of Republicans , led by Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tennessee , have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at $ 50,000 , a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2 % of the income distribution .\nA deduction cap is expected to raise roughly $ 800 billion in revenue above current policy , which is only half of the $ 1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners . It is , however , an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable .\nOne of the central problems with a deduction cap , however , is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations , which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations . Moreover , President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase , though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6 % ( which compares to today 's top rate of 35 % ) .\nSo , is there a way out of this impasse ? Rep. Mike Simpson , R-Idaho , along with Reps. Tom Cole , R-Oklahoma , Bob Dold , R-Illinois , and Mary Bono Mack , R-California , have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions , which would be allowed to expire .
