They exchanged text messages shortly after midnight on a Thursday , looking forward to the visit and talking about the new Batman movie Jessie was about to see .\nThey said goodnight , and Phillips tried going to sleep at her home in San Antonio .\nTwenty minutes later she got a frantic phone call from Jessie 's close friend , Brent , who was with her at the theater . He said there was a shooting , that he was shot twice .\n`` I said , 'Where 's Jessie ? ' '' Phillips recalls , before taking a short pause . `` He said , ' I tried ' . ''\nJessica Ghawi , 24 , was one of 12 people shot to death in July 2012 at a theater in Aurora , Colorado . Fifty-eight people were wounded . For Phillips , sharing her painful but final memory of Jessie is an emotional endeavor . Her voice thins and grows shaky as she talks about that night .\nBut it 's a challenge she has taken on dozens of times a day for the past week , going door to door in Colorado Springs as she asks voters to support a state lawmaker she never knew until this year : State Sen. John Morse .\nAs Senate president , Morse helped usher the passage of Colorado 's restrictive new firearm laws . The state 's deeply rooted gun rights establishment was not happy , and Morse is now one of two state senators on the ballot Tuesday in Colorado 's first recall at the state level .\nGun rights activists nationwide see the election as a pivotal moment in the gun debate . If Morse and his Democratic colleague , state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo , are both ousted , some say it will send a cautionary message to other lawmakers : Mess with guns and this could happen to you .\nThe other side also views the recall as a potential turning point . If the senators win , it could signal a significant show of public support at the polls for regulations meant to curb gun violence . Gun control advocates also argue a victory would deal a major blow to what they consider the powerful voices that control the debate .\nNational groups on both ends of the spectrum , including the National Rifle Association and Mayors Against Illegal Guns , have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the contests in what amounts to a proxy war over firearm regulations . At stake is a victory belt that can be used as leverage in future showdowns over the issue , either at the state level or in Washington .\nPhillips and her husband , Lonnie , have been calling on 60 to 80 homes each day in Colorado for more than a week . While a number of conversations are short-lived , she shares her story with anyone willing to listen , hoping it will change minds .\n`` It 's exhausting . You can only tell it so many times before you go to a very sad and dark place , '' she said . `` But you take a break and have a good cry , pull your boot straps back up and head out again . We ca n't just sit quietly by . ''\nIn March , Colorado became the second state after New York to put new gun laws on the books after the Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school shooting , which left 20 children and six adults dead .\nEffective July 1 , Colorado 's new laws limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks on all gun purchases . Gun buyers , rather than sellers , must pay for their own background checks , a $ 10 fee .\nThe U.S. Senate tried passing similar laws earlier this year amid a highly charged national debate that rattled both sides of the issue . While most of the measures had little chance of survival , the Senate even fell short of the votes needed to proceed with what seemed to be the most viable piece of legislation : a bipartisan measure that would require background checks on firearms bought online and at gun shows .\nHistorically a conservative state , Colorado 's political makeup has started to shift . It is one of three states in the West with a Democratic trifecta : The party holds both chambers of the legislature and the governor 's office . While Colorado has trended blue in recent years , its blood runs red with a history rich in gun culture and tradition\n`` Firearms are intertwined with the fabric of Colorado , '' said Jon Caldara , president of the Independence Institute , a Colorado conservative think tank . With the backing of 55 of the state 's 62 elected sheriffs , Caldera 's organization filed a lawsuit challenging the new laws .\nAs the home of two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history \u2014 Aurora and Columbine \u2014 Colorado has been a hot zone for the gun control debate . When state Senate committees held hearings one day over the gun measures in March , gun rights activists flooded the capitol in protest and drove around the building , honking horns for hours to cause a distraction . According to the Denver Post , a small plane flew overhead , carrying a floating message to the governor : Do n't take our guns\nAt the same time , lawmakers inside were also hearing from survivors and victims of gun violence , including former students at Columbine . Mark Kelly , husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , also testified about the shooting that seriously wounded his wife in the nearby state of Arizona .\nBy the end of the night , the two committees passed multiple gun control proposals . By the end of the month , Gov . John Hickenlooper signed the measures into law .\nMorse , the Senate president who helped lead the way in the gun control push , now finds himself campaigning against a recall effort mounted against him a little more than a year before the end of his second term in office . Term-limited , he ca n't run for re-election .\nBut he said he does n't have any regrets in fighting for tighter gun laws . Asked why he advocated for new regulations in the face of fierce opposition , Morse pointed to the real catalyst of the renewed firearm debate .\n`` The vision of 6- and 7-year-olds in Newtown being carted out on stretchers , with their Power Rangers T-shirts now covered by a white sheet , '' he said . `` We ca n't continue to bury our children . ''\nIt did n't take long for gun rights supporters to organize after the governor signed the gun package . With the help of the NRA , groups across the state attempted to gather signatures to recall a four state senators .\nActivists , however , collected the required amount of signatures in only two districts , those represented by Morse and Giron . Morse 's district is largely a swing district , with nearly four in 10 active voters being unaffiliated with a political party . Thirty-four percent are registered Democrats and 26 % are registered Republicans . Giron 's district has a larger Democratic presence .\nSince the recall tactic was first used in Los Angeles in 1903 , the effort has mostly been used at the municipal or local level , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Recalls are rarely successful for state lawmakers ; attempts have led to elections only 38 times in more than a century , with 17 of those officials actually being booted out of office .\nIn Colorado , opponents of the recall argue the tactic is a troubling sign for democracy . If recalls evolve into successful political maneuvers , Morse said , then both sides will start to use it and `` we 'll end up with general election in even-numbered years and recalls in odd-numbered years . ''\n`` It will make governing even more difficult than it is , '' he said .\nBut supporters of the Colorado recall say the effort is a prime example of democracy at work .\n`` Democracy does n't really live by a calendar , '' said Jennifer Kerns , a spokesperson for the group behind the recall effort against Morse . `` It 's up to the people when they want to rise up and do something like this . ''\nGiron did n't know much about guns when she was elected to office ; she went to Denver to tackle other social and economic issues . When the debate exploded earlier this year , she decided to learn more about firearms . She held town halls , attended her first gun show and went to a shooting range with some friends .\nShe ultimately decided her district \u2014 and state \u2014 would be better off with laws that seek to keep guns out of `` the hands of felons , '' she said , referring to the universal background check measure .\n`` This is not the wrong business to be fearful about doing the right thing , '' she added .\nBut a majority of Colorado voters disagree with Giron . According to a Quinnipiac University poll , 54 % of voters oppose the new gun laws , compared to 40 % who support them . At the same time , the poll indicates a majority do n't believe Giron and Morse should be recalled for their votes . By a margin of 60 % -31 % , Colorado voters say people should wait for re-election rather than attempt a recall when they disagree with their representative .\nKevin Healey , a 34-year-old voter in Pueblo , illustrates how the gun control debate in Colorado transcends traditional political divides . A staunch Second Amendment defender , Healey describes himself as an independent who `` leans very far to the left , '' except when it comes to gun rights issues .\nHealey argued the effort to regulate guns to stop gun violence is a useless battle and lawmakers should be tackling mental health issues instead . `` It 's almost like fighting to the south when the problem is up north . It does n't make any sense . ''\nHealey signed a recall petition a few months ago to put Giron on the ballot\u2014a decision , he said , that did not come easily .\n`` Pueblo is such a small town , it felt as if I was betraying someone behind her back , '' he said . Though he 's never really met her , he sent her an e-mail explaining why he had to sign the petition .\nBut after `` struggling for months , '' Healey has decided he 's not going to vote against Giron on Tuesday after all . While he disagrees with her on gun rights , he disagrees with her Republican opponent in the recall on just about everything . Essentially , he sees it as picking the lesser of two bad options .\nStill , Healey does n't regret signing the original petition . No matter what the outcome , he thinks the recall sends a message to elected Democrats across the country that they ca n't `` just take the Second Amendment lightly . ''\n`` It will make people think twice and be creative in legislating instead of doing something symbolic but completely useless , '' he said . `` I 'm sure her intention was genuine , but there has got to be more creative modes to stopping the violence . ''\nRepublican state Sen. Greg Brophy , who 's running for governor and has been part of the campaign to oust his Democratic colleagues , believes supporters of the recall have already won , because they got the warning out . `` The future of the Second Amendment will be decided in Colorado , '' he said .\nHe pointed to Giron 's district , where Democrats make up nearly half the active electorate , while unaffiliated voters make up 29 % and Republicans make up 23 % .\n`` The fact that a Democratic state senator in a reliably Democratic seat , Pueblo , is either going to lose a recall or barely retain her office -- that 's a victory either way , '' he said . `` People in seats that are n't as reliably Democratic might want to be careful about advancing the gun control agenda . I see Tuesday as a win-win , or quite possibly , a win-no lose . ''\nNot surprisingly , the two lawmakers whose names are on the ballot feel differently .\n`` The numbers are going to prove that in a state that had two of the largest tragedies in this country , it would have been a travesty not to address this issue , '' Giron said .\nMorse brushed off the notion that the recall has already done its work for gun rights activists .\n`` They have n't won anything , '' he said . `` And hopefully wo n't win anything .
