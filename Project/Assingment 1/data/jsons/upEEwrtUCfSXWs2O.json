This was where a conservative advocacy group convinced a circuit court judge to order the state to remove more than 230,000 people removed from the state \u2019 s voter rolls . Wisconsin was already considered a crucial swing state in 2020 \u2013 bearing in mind that Donald Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016 . More than half of the voters at risk of being purged lived in areas that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump that year , according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel .\nTop Trump adviser : Republicans have 'always ' relied on voter suppression Read more\nA week later , one of Trump \u2019 s reelection advisers was caught on tape telling a Wisconsin Republicans that the party has \u201c traditionally \u201d relied on voter suppression . \u201c Traditionally it \u2019 s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places . Let \u2019 s start protecting our voters . We know where they are , \u201d the adviser , Justin Clark , said in audio obtained by the Associated Press . \u201c Let \u2019 s start playing offense a little bit . That \u2019 s what you \u2019 re going to see in 2020 . It \u2019 s going to be a much bigger program , a much more aggressive program , a much better-funded program . \u201d\nThere was now even less doubt that the Republicans intended to rely on both encouraging , and discouraging , voters as a key part of their 2020 election strategy .\nWisconsin wasn \u2019 t the only state where removing voters from the rolls en-masse came under scrutiny . The same week , in Georgia , the state voted to remove more than 300,000 people from the rolls . 120,000 of those people were removed because they hadn \u2019 t voted since 2012 and also failed to respond to multiple notices from the state asking them to confirm their address . The removals drew national outcry in a state that has been at the epicenter of accusations of voter suppression .\nIn 2017 the then secretary of state , Brian Kemp , removed more 500,000 from voter rolls and a month before the Gubernatorial election in 2018 he held up registrations of 53,000 under the state \u2019 s \u201c exact match \u201d law where a misplaced hyphen or comma in a voter registration record could mean more obstacles for someone to vote . Brian Kemp stood in that election and defeated Stacy Abrams by just 55,000 votes . Abrams later called Kemp a \u201c remarkable architect of voter suppression \u201d .\nThe controversies in Wisconsin and Georgia underscore how the mass removal of voters from the rolls \u2013 often called voter purging \u2013 has moved to the center of the polarized fight over voting rights in the United States . Although there is a consensus that purging , done carefully , is a useful tool to keep voting rolls accurate and remove people who move and die , there is growing alarm over how aggressively it is being used to penalize people , essentially , for not voting .\nOverall , at least 17 million people have been removed from the voter rolls since the 2016 election , an uptick from the number of voters who were removed between 2006 and 2008 , according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice . Although it \u2019 s not known how many of those removals were legitimate , the increase comes even as the number of Americans who move has dropped to historic lows .\n\u201c Folks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout , \u201d said Stuart Naifeh , an attorney at Demos who was involved in a high-profile voter purge case at the United States supreme court last year . Voter purges \u201c is one that seems to have become more popular . \u201d\nPurging is not new \u2013 federal law has required it for more than two decades \u2013 but there is a new awareness of how purges can remove eligible voters from the rolls and target populations that move a lot : the young , the poor and people who live in cities , all groups that tend to favor Democrats .\n\u201c It \u2019 s only bad when it \u2019 s done poorly . When it captures people who are still in the state or who are still eligible voters and shouldn \u2019 t be removed , \u201d said David Becker , the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research , who works with states cleaning their voter rolls .\nMyrna P\u00e9rez , director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice , pointed out that there used to be an important tool to keep voting jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination from \u201c bad \u201d purges : the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act . Until 2013 , if a state covered by the law wanted to make a change in its purge process , it would have to show the federal government that it wasn \u2019 t to the detriment of minority voters .\nThe oversight helped prevent both discriminatory purge practices and allowed states to catch errors in their methodology , Perez said . But it was lifted in 2013 when the supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act . When the law was still in full effect , P\u00e9rez said , \u201c it had the effect of stalling and stopping intentional and accidental sloppiness . \u201d\nAnother legal blow came in 2018 , when the supreme court ruled in favor of a controversial way of carrying out purges .\nFolks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout Stuart Naifeh\nThe case involved Larry Harmon , a software engineer in Ohio , who sued the state when he discovered in 2015 that , after sitting out several elections , he was unable to vote on a marijuana initiative because he had been purged . If someone misses a federal election in Ohio , the state sends them a postcard asking them to confirm their address . If they don \u2019 t respond to the postcard and fail to vote in two more consecutive elections , they are removed from the rolls . Voting rights groups call the Ohio rule the \u201c use it or lose it \u201d law .\nHarmon argued that he was being punished for not voting , which is prohibited by federal law . And critics said that linking one \u2019 s ability to stay on the voter rolls to one \u2019 s ability to vote can discriminate against people who face more obstacles getting to the polls , such as those who can \u2019 t get childcare or time off from work . But in a 5-4 ruling , the supreme court said the process was legal because Harmon wasn \u2019 t removed solely for not voting \u2013 he had also received the postcard .\nThe ruling \u201c opened the floodgates \u201d to aggressive voter purging , said Kathy Culliton-Gonzalez , a voting rights attorney .\nMailers and postcards are a controversial way of asking voters to confirm their voter registration . In 2018 , states reported sending more than 21 million address confirmation notices and only around 20 % of them were returned , according to federal data . The fact that so few people return the postcards signals that they \u2019 re not really a reliable way of assessing whether people have moved , voting advocates argue .\nBut voter purges are more than just a question of lapsed bureaucracy , they are now emerging as a new political battleground .\nIn Ohio , for instance , Democrats and Republicans have overseen voter purges for two decades , but recently , the practice seems to have clearly benefited Republicans . Voters in Democratic neighborhoods in the state \u2019 s three largest counties were struck from the rolls at nearly twice the rate as voters in Republican ones , according to a 2016 Reuters analysis . In largely African American neighborhoods in Cincinnati , over 10 % of voters were purged , compared to just 4 % in the suburbs .\nEarlier this year , Ohio purged 158,000 voters from its rolls using that process , according to an analysis by the Columbus Dispatch . The removals came even after activists in the state discovered around 40,000 errors on the list of voters set to be purged . Oklahoma , which employs a similar purge process to Ohio and Georgia , also removed more than 88,000 inactive voters from its rolls in April .\nEven so , there has been some recent successes in stopping unfair purges . Earlier this year , voting groups successfully blocked an Indiana law that would have allowed the state to cancel a voter registration if they had information the voter moved , but without giving the voter a chance to confirm that . Civil rights groups also stopped Texas from cancelling voter registrations of nearly 100,000 people it accused of being non-citizens based on faulty data .\nIn Wisconsin , election officials have declined to move ahead with the purge while an appeal is pending . The Wisconsin Democratic party has also pledged to contact voters and urge them to re-register ( the state allows people to register online , through their local clerk , or at the polls on election day . )\nDo black people vote ? The racist lie rooted in the American psyche | Rashawn Ray Read more\nAnd in Georgia , there has been another victory \u2013 of sorts . Earlier this month , Brad Raffensperger , Georgia \u2019 s top election official , announced he made a mistake . Days after his office scrubbed 300,000 people from its voter rolls , he revealed 22,000 of them had been incorrectly removed . The voters should have been given several more months to confirm their voter registration .\nRaffensperger said he was reactivating their voter registrations to give them more time . \u201c We are proactively taking additional steps to prevent any confusion come the day of the election , \u201d he said in a statement .\nSome crucial protections against bad voter purging also remain in place . Federal law prohibits states from systematically cleaning their rolls within 90 days of a federal election and says the systems state develop to remove people from the rolls must be \u201c non-discriminatory . \u201d\nIt is clear that next year \u2019 s election is already becoming an epic battle to try and preserve the voting rights of millions of voters .
