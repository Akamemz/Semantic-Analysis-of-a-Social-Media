    "content": "There is a profound difference between ( i ) the soap-opera charges now being leveled by some opportunistic women against President Donald Trump and leveraged for cheap political gain by the Gillibrand Hypocrites within the Democrat Party and ( ii ) the pants-dropping of The Icon , John Conyers , and the butt-squeezing , tongue-slithering obscenities of Sen. Al Franken ( who now indeed will have to leave the upper chamber , with no Roy Moore to counterbalance ) . Conyers and Franken have lost all legitimacy . By contrast , the American people elected President Trump with full transparent cognition of his public and private portfolio , thereby validating his office .\n1 . Personal Character Allegations Were Litigated Fully with Transparency in 2016 , and the Voters Acted as Jury .\nThe difference between the President and Disgraced Franken-Conyers is that the charges against President Trump fully were litigated before the voters during the 2016 Presidential election . We heard the Billy Bush trailer tape . We read the New York Times front-page stories quoting former beauty contestants \u2014 some of whom rebutted the allegations and quotes ascribed to them . The voters knew all about it . And , fully apprised , the American people elected Donald Trump to be President .\nThat is how democracy works . Each side sets forth its best case \u2014 which , unfortunately , consists mostly of setting forth the other candidate \u2019 s worst case . There are ads , robocalls , newsmedia expos\u00e9s and dirt-excavations , and finally debates during which each side gets to throw at the opponent all the dirt , mud , slime , grime , feces , and other schmutz their advisers can get their hands on . Before the debate they shake hands and promise to come out fighting clean . By the end , they not only need to soak their limbs with hand sanitizer but also to drink half a bottle of the stuff .\nWe knew all the filth about Hillary Clinton : her lies , her federal spoliation crimes that still await a fair and proper investigation and prosecution , her two-faced deceitfulness , her role in the Benghazi murders of American heroes and her attempted cover-up , her conniving lying to the bereaved widows and parents of the fallen , her role in approving the transfer of American nuclear material to Vladimir Putin even as her better half got paid $ 500,000 for some reason , her $ 125,000 honoraria for clandestine 15-minute speeches on Wall Street , her utter physical collapse on a Manhattan street on September 11 , the false story of how she was named at birth for Sir Edmund Hillary , the lie that she arrived in Bosnia heroically under gunfire , her episode of screaming for half an hour at the Prime Minister of Israel and deeming Jewish home-building in East Jerusalem to be illegal , her presiding over the fall of the Crimea thanks to her \u201c reset button , \u201d her disastrous endorsement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and of other calamitous multi-lateral trade agreements that worked against American workers , her promise to put coal workers out of jobs , her refusal to approve the Keystone pipeline , her giggles remembering the time she helped an admitted child rapist go free , her prior experiences with Whitewater and Cattle Futures and Travelgate and character-assassinating women whom her better half raped or otherwise sexually molested , her calling 63 million good hard-working Americans a \u201c basketful of deplorables , \u201d her bleaching her computer hard drive that she had secreted in a bathroom in her home , her playing the race card , her playing the gender card ( \u201c Deal me in ! \u201d ) , her playing the ethnicity card , her ignoring Wisconsin , Michigan , and other Rust Belt states while foolishly campaigning to run up the vote in Sunny California where her Harvey Weinstein crowd of Hollywood sycophants pumped her full of bucks after long days on casting couches .\nThat is what a Presidential election or any election is . We saw all the Hillary we could stomach , and we likewise saw the good , the bad , and the ugly of Donald Trump . We heard the Billy Bush tape played so often , night and day , day after day , on the leftist mainstream media that we would have mistaken it for the National Anthem \u2014 but for the fact that Colin Kaepernick did not take a knee when it aired . We saw a lifetime of Republican Crowd Debates , and we saw Trump \u2019 s good side , his ridiculous side , and the side from which we recoiled . We heard and saw Marco Rubio take his best shots at Trump , John Kasich take his best shots , and all the others from Carly Fiorina \u2014 what in the world was she ever doing there ? \u2014 to Rand Paul to Ted Cruz take their best shots . The election unfolded as it did , and the American people as jury rendered their verdict , choosing Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States .\n2 . The Hillary Whiners and Democrat Sore Losers Have Rejected the Voters \u2019 Clear Choice with Blind \u201c Resistance \u201d for a Year by Pursuing Cynical Scheme After Cynical Scheme to Sabotage the Duly Elected President .\nFrom the day Mr. Trump was elected , the Democrats have concocted one ruse after another to sabotage the democratic will of the American electorate . First they challenged the authenticity of the vote counts . After Trump gained votes during many of the recounts , they shifted course and appealed to members of the Electoral College to violate their sworn oaths and vote for the loser . Then , when the Electors stood by their pledges of honor and elected Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States , they challenged the very legitimacy of the Electoral College itself . Then they tried to get celebrities not to perform at the Inauguration . In the alternative , they showed up in their puerile vagina hats , with faux courage saying that they contemplated blowing up the White House . Then they tried to prevent his cabinet choices from being approved . Then they tried blackballing his Supreme Court selection to serve as the next United States Justice . They brazenly emblazoned themselves \u201c The Resistance. \u201d They blocked and delayed every Presidential appointment possible . Every time he issued an executive order , they forum-shopped in Hawaii or San Francisco to find a federal judge appointed by Obama or Clinton to block the order , knowing that the injunction would be affirmed by the liberal United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . They went on television , mocking his penchant for tweeting 140 characters to the American people several times daily , as he bypassed their biases and leveraged new technology to articulate his thoughts directly to the public , unfiltered . They said that he spends all day tweeting when he merely was sending out 500-2000 typed characters daily , consuming less time than a fifteen-minute salsa in front of Raul Castro . Then they called him an anti-Semite because of bomb threats anonymously dialed into Jewish Community Centers \u2014 as it turned out , phoned in by a mentally ill teen calling from Israel . They never apologized even though he issued warm statements on Jewish holy days , sensitively memorialized the Shoah ( Nazi Holocaust ) , ended eight years of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry Hell that saw Israel constantly attacked from a Washington that even allowed Israel to get gang-banged at the United Nations Security Council . They still were calling him an anti-Semite even as he announced finally that the 1995 near-unanimous law of Congress would be implemented , and America formally now recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will move our Israeli embassy there from Tel Aviv . ( Indeed , his daughter is an Orthodox Jew , and several of his grandchildren thus are Jewish \u2014 something that many of his leftist Obama-supporting Jewish critics , to their shame , can not say . )\nThen the Democrats and left-liberals accused him of colluding with Vladimir Putin to throw the election . These Democrats who never regarded Putin as the problem , who mocked Republican warnings about the Soviets and their Russian successors for half a century , as conservatives pleaded for a stronger American posture amid Putin seizing Crimea and part of Ukraine . In the 2012 Presidential debates , Obama mocked Mitt Romney for deeming Putin a serious foe and obstacle to American values and security . And then suddenly , having run out of anti-Trump obstructions , the Democrats cynically reversed course and elevated Putin to the cause of all woe , the conspirator with Trump . For a full year they have been investigating the Trump White House , spending millions of our tax dollars on a Robert Mueller witch hunt , conducted by the Clinton Deep State All-Stars , a team of partisan Clinton Democrat sponsors and donors , and documented virulent Trump haters . And what has been discovered after a year ? That Paul Manafort conducted private business overseas and bought expensive clothes with his income . That Gen. Michael Flynn spoke with his Russian counterpart to discuss American-Russian national security concerns after the Trump election in the hopes of calming brewing tensions as the Trump succession team prepared to enter elected office . That James Comey leaked FBI documentary information to the New York Times through a professor friend at Columbia Law School , drafted an exonerating letter for Hillary Clinton before even concluding the rigged investigation that spurred her better half to meet on an Arizona airport tarmac for half an hour to discuss with Attorney General Loretta Lynch their common interest in golf , and even allowed a pro-Clinton/Trump-hating partisan to change the wording of the letter to mask Hillary \u2019 s statutory crime of \u201c gross negligence \u201d by altering it to \u201c extreme carelessness. \u201d And that a high-up guy in the Justice Department was in cahoots all along with the Fusion GPS Hatchet & Fertilizer Company that prepared the fake Trump dossier , while the guy \u2019 s wife was working all along in that company \u2019 s paid employ . And that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the libelous dossier . And that a guy named Podesta , Tony the bro of John , was involved in the sordid mix . That is what Mueller has found so far as his long-running show presumably qualifies for a \u201c Golden Globe \u201d nomination and prepares to be picked up for a second season after a summer of reruns .\nNext they said that Donald Trump is a racist . Somehow , while he had been in public life for half a century before , quite notorious in the public eye , ever the media darling and spectacle , no one ever before had associated him with racism . As he built hotels and casinos , as he hosted a crazy but adorably popular and kitschy reality television show , no one ever whispered \u201c racist. \u201d Somehow , no one \u2014 no Black leader , no White Democrat liberal , no one in half a century ever saw a racist bone in the loud , brash New Yorker . And it is not because he was admired like Mother Teresa or Father Damien . Everyone always knew about \u201c The Donald \u201d and his hubris , his screwy side . But no one , not even Jesse Jackson \u2014 who made his \u201c Rainbow Coalition \u201d fame and fortune by huckstering for payoffs and shaking down corporate executives with threats that he would boycott them as \u201c racist \u201d if they did not cough up moolah \u2014 ever called Donald Trump a racist . And then he got elected 45th President of the United States . And suddenly the epithet \u2014 racist .\nThe man honors Martin Luther King \u2014 and they call him \u201c racist. \u201d He goes to civil rights museums , and they call him \u201c racist. \u201d He meets in the Oval Office with presidents of Black Colleges , and they call him \u201c racist. \u201d If he goes to the Civil Rights museum to honor African American heroes and their struggle for equality and justice , then they will not go . But if he does not go , then they will go and say \u201c Look at how the racist did not come to the museum. \u201d For half a century , no one ever accused him of denying people employment or demoting them or underpaying them based on color , ethnicity , creed , or sexual preference . And suddenly the hypocritical likes of Nancy Pelosi , whose Congressional District population is less than ten percent African American , calls him racist .\nThey likewise called him fascist and compared him to Hitler . \u201c If Trump is elected , we will lose our freedoms and become a fascist Nazi country. \u201d Did Hitler visit Civil Rights museums and say that all Germans bleed the same red blood ? Did Hitler celebrate Chanukah in the Reichstag and invite rabbis to a telephone conference in advance of Rosh Hashanah to wish all Jewish citizens blessings for a good and healthy New Year ? When President Trump \u2019 s executive orders on immigration were stifled by liberal Democrat-appointed judges , did he have the judges arrested ? No , he grumbled and tweeted , but he honored the rule of law as laid out in the Constitution . As the Democrats , the \u201c Resistance , \u201d have attempted to sabotage his every step , has he had them detained ? No , he has tweeted . He has turned to the American public , exposing the plague of Fake News that permeates everything from the Washington Post ( tweeting half-empty stadiums ? ) to the New York Times ( watching eight hours a day of television ? ) to ABC ( Brian Ross ? ) to MSNBC ( all of it ) to CNN ( employees terminated for Fake News ) . He lives with the Fake News and unjustified smear jobs \u2014 Do we really care whether he drinks more Coke than Obama snorted ? \u2014 and he responds by appealing to his supporters , honoring the Constitutional process . We know the legislation he has wanted , but when the Republican Senate would not give him the votes , he had to postpone repealing and replacing Obamacare . When his proposed tax bill demanded horse-trading to pass , he traded horses . In every way , he has been the consummate Constitutional President , tested as no one since , yes , Lincoln and Andrew Johnson . They even have the temerity to question his sanity , his mental stability , his fitness under the 25th Amendment to hold high office , claiming that he slurred three words while delivering a teleprompter speech , even though he soon thereafter delivered a masterfully colorful , articulate , and wildly crowd-pleasing 80-minute speech to tens of thousands in Pensacola , Florida a few days later . It is not he but they who slur \u2014 him \u2014 and the mental examinations that suddenly excite them might first be tested on the likes of their own Maxine Waters to set a base score .\n3 . Now the Latest Despicable Outrage : The Cynical Attempt to Equate the President with the Disgraced Conyers and Franken , Hypocritically Led by Kirsten Gillibrand Who Has Built Her Political Base by Enabling Women Sex Abusers .\nRegard the parasitic Gillibrand Hypocrites who lived luxuriously off the rapacious Clintons until the Clintons had no more to offer them , who abided and chummed with Al Franken and his manifest obscenities until they saw greater value in dumping The Groper for the good of the team . Now these deceitful scoundrels aver that Trump should be challenged based on revived , yet stale , time-barred allegations from the kinds of women who never experienced what Juanita Broaddrick , Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey , or Monica Lewinsky endured at the seat of power .\nUnderstand that Kirsten Gillibrand was among the enablers and promoters of the Bill Clinton who sexually abused , physically assaulted , and even raped . We all knew . Everyone knew . Kirsten Gillibrand knew . \u201c I hope you \u2019 re as excited as I am that we have President Clinton here in Watertown ! \u201d she crowed at one campaign rally . The internet is filled with photographs of excited smiling Gillibrand clutching Bill \u2019 s hands or letting Clinton put his arm around her and laughing with him , exulting that she had spent time with him up-close campaigning alongside him . She knew exactly who he was and what he had done to physically abuse subordinate and defenseless women again and again . No wonder Clinton adviser Philippe Reines wrote about her : \u201c Over 20 yrs you took the Clintons \u2019 endorsements , money , and seat . Hypocrite . \u201d\nGillibrand is despicable in her two-faced position on \u201c defending women. \u201d Would you call a person who advocates female genital mutilation a \u201c woman-hating sex abuser \u201d ? If so , then Kirsten Gillibrand has empowered other women sex abusers . Consider : Linda Sarsour , a prominent hater on the Left , posted this about two Muslim women who publicly have decried radical Islamic extremists : \u201c Brigitte Gabriel = Ayaan Hirsi Ali . She \u2019 s asking 4 an a $ $ whippin \u2019 . I wish I could take their vaginas away \u2014 they don \u2019 t deserve to be women. \u201d Yet this vicious hater and female misogynist \u2014 imagine if Trump had said to Billy Bush \u201c I wish I could take their vaginas away \u201d \u2014 has been praised repeatedly by Gillibrand . On at least one occasion , Kirsten Gillibrand called this vicious woman sex-abuser \u201c [ one of the ] suffragists of our time. \u201d Gillibrand further beamed that \u201c it was an honor to write about \u201d Sarsour , praising her in a Time magazine cover story . An avalanche of angry attacks against Gillibrand followed on social media , and even the New York Times published an op-ed educating the public about the hate-filled Sarsour while noting in shock how Gillibrand had gushed over this female misogynist with admiration .\nThis latest Trump-bullying scheme will fail as have all the others . The effort to equate President Trump \u2019 s legitimacy with the disgrace of Conyers or Franken fails facially . One difference is that Al Franken went to the electorate with his groping background hidden from the voters , his hands in his pockets or stuffing ballots , and his tongue in his own mouth . John Conyers presented himself to the voters while wearing pants . Truly \u2014 truly \u2014 let Franken now go to the voters , and if they elect him to the Senate now , then touch\u00e9 ! Let Conyers present himself for an Election Day validation , and if validated \u2014 good for him ! Charley Rangel did it after being zonked by the House Ethics Committee , and he prevailed . Because that is how America works . It is a democracy , and the voters decide . The people speak and render their verdict as jury .\nAs of now , the people of Minnesota never have been asked whether they would elect to the Senate the Lingua Franken that we now all know . The Detroit voters never have been asked whether they would choose a Congressman who contracts his breeches .\nBy contrast , the American people indeed were presented with the clear understanding of who Donald Trump is , what his background is , where he failed in the past . They knew about and debated the corporate bankruptcies . They knew about Billy Bush in the trailer . And the people of the United States freely decided . He was elected with full transparency by a body-slamming 306-232 electoral college runaway . The issues were litigated fully , the jury returned with a resounding verdict for Trump . That case is closed , free of double jeopardy .\nLet the message be clear to the Gillibrand Hypocrites who enable sex offenders and gush over sex abusers , and to the Groping Democrat Phonies who have lived off the Harvey Weinsteins , Al Frankens , and iconic John Conyerses for all too long : Keep your hypocrisy-stained hands off our President .",

Now these deceitful scoundrels aver that Trump should be challenged based on revived, yet stale, time-barred allegations from the kinds of women who never experienced what Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, or Monica Lewinsky endured at the seat of power.\n\nUnderstand that Kirsten Gillibrand was among the enablers and promoters of the Bill Clinton who sexually abused, physically assaulted, and even raped. We all knew. Everyone knew. Kirsten Gillibrand knew. \u201cI hope you\u2019re as excited as I am that we have President Clinton here in Watertown!\u201d she crowed at one campaign rally. The internet is filled with photographs of excited smiling Gillibrand clutching Bill\u2019s hands or letting Clinton put his arm around her and laughing with him, exulting that she had spent time with him up-close campaigning alongside him. She knew exactly who he was and what he had done to physically abuse subordinate and defenseless women again and again. No wonder Clinton adviser Philippe Reines wrote about her: \u201cOver 20 yrs you took the Clintons\u2019 endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite.\u201d\n\nGillibrand is despicable in her two-faced position on \u201cdefending women.\u201d Would you call a person who advocates female genital mutilation a \u201cwoman-hating sex abuser\u201d? If so, then Kirsten Gillibrand has empowered other women sex abusers. Consider: Linda Sarsour, a prominent hater on the Left, posted this about two Muslim women who publicly have decried radical Islamic extremists: \u201cBrigitte Gabriel = Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She\u2019s asking 4 an a$$ whippin\u2019. I wish I could take their vaginas away \u2014 they don\u2019t deserve to be women.\u201d Yet this vicious hater and female misogynist \u2014 imagine if Trump had said to Billy Bush \u201cI wish I could take their vaginas away\u201d \u2014 has been praised repeatedly by Gillibrand. On at least one occasion, Kirsten Gillibrand called this vicious woman sex-abuser \u201c[one of the] suffragists of our time.\u201d Gillibrand further beamed that \u201cit was an honor to write about\u201d Sarsour, praising her in a Time magazine cover story. An avalanche of angry attacks against Gillibrand followed on social media, and even the New York Times published an op-ed educating the public about the hate-filled Sarsour while noting in shock how Gillibrand had gushed over this female misogynist with admiration.\n\nThis latest Trump-bullying scheme will fail as have all the others. The effort to equate President Trump\u2019s legitimacy with the disgrace of Conyers or Franken fails facially. One difference is that Al Franken went to the electorate with his groping background hidden from the voters, his hands in his pockets or stuffing ballots, and his tongue in his own mouth. John Conyers presented himself to the voters while wearing pants. Truly \u2014 truly \u2014 let Franken now go to the voters, and if they elect him to the Senate now, then touch\u00e9! Let Conyers present himself for an Election Day validation, and if validated \u2014 good for him! Charley Rangel did it after being zonked by the House Ethics Committee, and he prevailed. Because that is how America works. It is a democracy, and the voters decide. The people speak and render their verdict as jury.\n\nAs of now, the people of Minnesota never have been asked whether they would elect to the Senate the Lingua Franken that we now all know. The Detroit voters never have been asked whether they would choose a Congressman who contracts his breeches.\n\nBy contrast, the American people indeed were presented with the clear understanding of who Donald Trump is, what his background is, where he failed in the past. They knew about and debated the corporate bankruptcies. They knew about Billy Bush in the trailer. And the people of the United States freely decided. He was elected with full transparency by a body-slamming 306-232 electoral college runaway. The issues were litigated fully, the jury returned with a resounding verdict for Trump. That case is closed, free of double jeopardy.\n\nLet the message be clear to the Gillibrand Hypocrites who enable sex offenders and gush over sex abusers, and to the Groping Democrat Phonies who have lived off the Harvey Weinsteins, Al Frankens, and iconic John Conyerses for all too long: Keep your hypocrisy-stained hands off our President.",
