He \u2019 s got a different endgame than we do . There are things we have to do here . We \u2019 ve got to fund the government every year . \u201d\nBy moving to quarantine Cruz from the rest of the conference over the past three months , the majority leader demonstrated that he \u2019 s learned the lessons of the Cruz-backed government shutdown in 2013 and the Texas senator \u2019 s rogue strategy last winter that helped Democrats confirm a raft of judges in the lame duck session .

But McConnell made his move well before the Sept. 30 deadline , limiting the procedural hijinks that Cruz could deploy .\nThen on Monday , Republicans shut down Cruz \u2019 s effort to force a procedural vote he dubbed a referendum on McConnell \u2019 s leadership .
