    "content": "Treasury Secretary Jack Lew \u2019 s announcement of a series of new rules to reduce the financial incentives behind corporate inversions tells you a lot about where our economy sits right now . Productivity and growth scarcely matter as much as what I would call the \u201c gimmick economy. \u201d Companies now spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out not how to beat their competition , but how to prosper from tricks and loopholes their accountants find buried in the law . Every corporation has become , at the root , a financial company , adept at moving money around on paper and little else . And the government has to scramble in a never-ending race to keep up with the innovations .\nTo start with , understand what a corporate inversion is : an on-paper transaction involving a merger between a larger U.S. company and a smaller counterpart abroad . No worker moves overseas as a result of the merger . No production facilities or corporate offices transfer . Instead , the address on the corporate masthead changes from America to the low-tax alternative where the overseas company is headquartered . It \u2019 s a completely fictitious pretension , no different than if I used a handicapped placard to park in good spots everywhere I went , and then limped around after getting out of the car .\nCEOs claim that America \u2019 s burdensome 35 percent corporate tax rate forces them to be creative , and in absence of fundamental tax reform , they must reluctantly renounce their corporate citizenship to stay competitive with their overseas counterparts . First of all , in actuality , corporate taxes are not much of a burden ; thanks to all the loopholes and credits , corporations pay on average a 12.6 percent tax rate , according to a 2013 Government Accountability Office paper . Second , by that logic , if I think a bank vault unfairly denies me access to lots of money , I should be allowed to use creative strategies to bust it open .\nIn reality , corporations \u2019 reasons to invert have nothing to do with staying competitive , as USC law professor Ed Kleinbard explained in a recent paper . It \u2019 s merely about preventing the unintended consequences of one gimmick , by loading up on another gimmick .\nYou see , multinational corporations have more than $ 2 trillion parked offshore , money that was either earned through foreign subsidiaries , or from a series of tax-sheltering strategies . That money , in theory , can not be transferred to their American operations \u2013 in particular , to reward executives and shareholders \u2013 without paying a tax . Corporations therefore defer repatriating these profits , and the money remains \u201c trapped \u201d overseas , although the bulk of it is actually invested in things like Treasury bonds , earning modest interest amid the tax avoidance .\nCorporations first tried to deal with this through public whining , claiming that they could not reinvest in America without bringing this money home tax-free . In 2004 , Congress approved a tax amnesty on offshore cash , but the $ 300 billion repatriated did not go to investment or growth , but mostly to stock buybacks and dividends to goose share prices .\nThe 2004 amnesty led corporations to assume that they could simply stockpile money out of the U.S. , and beg Congress for another reprieve . But Congress , incredibly , learned a lesson , and never allowed repatriation again .\nSo inversions became a second option for trying to unlock overseas cash . Once corporations establish a headquarters offshore , they can basically funnel money into it to avoid taxes , in a number of ways . They can make loans from the offshore cash into their new foreign parent company , \u201c hopscotching \u201d the U.S. tax system . They can strip earnings from their domestic operations and , through accounting tricks , pretend they were earned overseas , again passing them along to the foreign parent . They can spin out their assets to a shell company built in a tax haven ( known as a \u201c spinversion \u201d ) to facilitate the earnings stripping and hopscotch loans .\nIn all cases , the goal is to get as much money into the lowest tax treatment as possible . And it won \u2019 t surprise you to know that Wall Street , which facilitates all these mergers , makes a tidy profit in the exchange , nearly a billion dollars in the past three years .\nWith the new regulations announced Monday , the Treasury Department will attempt to stop some of these transactions , though not all of them . The rules attack hopscotch loans by making the inverted company liable for taxes when they try to take deferred profits from a subsidiary . They prevent pass-throughs of stock or property into foreign parent companies to avoid taxation . And they try to prevent spinversions into a third-party shell corporation . But Treasury did not try to reduce incentives for earnings stripping , the ways in which inverted companies shift money into the foreign parent and lower the tax bill on their U.S. earnings .\nVictor Fleischer , a tax law professor at the University of San Diego , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c It should shut down a few deals but not all . It \u2019 s not as aggressive as the Treasury could have been , but far better than doing nothing. \u201d You \u2019 ll be shocked to learn that the Obama administration found a middle path on a policy .\nYou can read tons of articles debating the administration \u2019 s anti-inversion strategy . But let \u2019 s look at the big picture of what these inversions signify . Corporations , at great effort and expense , have figured out how to pretend to be domiciled overseas to save money . The government , through similar effort and expense , cuts off some of the benefits . Presumably what happens next is that corporations engage in another round of scouring the tax code for some other way to profit . And government has to chase that . And so on .\nTax dodges are as old as the republic . But I seem to remember a time when selling a half-decent product was the pathway to corporate riches . Since the 1980s , however , large corporations , from Google to GE , have fundamentally become financial firms , using sophisticated techniques to manage their cash . Sometimes that involves parking money offshore ; sometimes it involves interest-rate swaps or other derivatives ; sometimes it involves using debt to finance operations because it offers better tax advantages than equity ; sometimes it involves using stock buybacks or real estate sales to simulate better corporate performance .\nSo many resources go to financial engineering that research and development or capital investment , things that circulate money through an economy , ends up withering . The gimmick economy values tax arbitrage or pretend growth to actually out-achieving business competitors . The stock price , and how to game it , becomes an end goal for executives who are typically paid based on how well the stock performs . CEOs with backgrounds in investment banking become more valuable than those with experience in the corporation \u2019 s actual industry .\nThis myopic preference of the short-term over the long-term goes a long way to explaining why we have a Main Street economy with stagnant wages , weak job security and an inability to get ahead . All the money gets tied up in financial game-playing to goose short-term values . And the powerful actors who created this system don \u2019 t want it to change .\nCongress can end this gimmick on inversions by deciding that , if a company is managed in the United States , it \u2019 s American , regardless of the address on the letterhead .
