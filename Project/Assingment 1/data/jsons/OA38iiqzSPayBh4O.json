    "content": "Elchingen , in the German state of Bavaria is not used to foreigners . And when townspeople in the village , hemmed in by corn fields , found out in late 2013 that they were going to be hosts to dozens of asylum seekers , many fought back , going door-to-door gathering some 800 signatures to say \u201c no . \u201d\n\u201c I felt so ashamed to be an Elchingener , \u201d says Renate Willbold-Vajagic , a local .\nSo when asylum-seekers from Syria , Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , and beyond arrived in this upper middle-class community , she and a group of residents , many retired , created an organization called the \u201c Friends of Asylum-seekers . \u201d\nTheir grassroots effort has grown into an impressive operation , based in a community center . Newcomers can borrow bikes to get from the village to the nearest city 6 miles away , take German classes , and get maps , orientation , or whatever else they need , from backpacks for children to thick winter coats .\nThis is the new face of Germany , where a sense of responsibility , position of strength , and confidence at integrating others before has turned it into Europe \u2019 s beacon of humanity amid the largest movement of people since World War II .\nAnd yet , for as much as it is willing \u2013 and able \u2013 to do , it can \u2019 t do everything . On Sunday , Germany shocked Europe by introducing border controls with Austria , from where thousands of migrants have passed into Munich \u2013 13,000 on Saturday alone . The move is seen not just as a response to record inflows into Germany but also a plan to push the European Union into sharing the burden as justice and interior ministers meet today in Brussels .\nGermany 's new Willkommenskultur , or \u201c welcome culture , \u201d has been celebrated across the country , but it is not universally embraced . Germany finds itself at a fragile moment , where the welcome could wither , as the world looks to how Germany leads amid a crisis that is testing Europe \u2019 s union arguably more than any issue since its founding .\nHajo Funke , a professor of political culture at the Free University of Berlin , says it \u2019 s a historic moment if Germany is able to maintain this \u201c new mentality of empathy . \u201d\n\u201c This wave of hundreds of thousands in each and every city and town is unique in the history of Germany , \u201d he says . \u201c As much as [ politicians ] really do their job , that empathy can hold . \u201d\nMunich has become the gateway into Germany for asylum-seekers , and ground zero of Willkommenskultur . On Saturday , as a large group of weary asylum-seekers arrived in Munich \u2019 s Hauptbahnhof , or main train station , people gathered to clap . \u201c Thank you , thank you , \u201d said one man , holding a toddler in his arms .\nThe migrants are shuttled to an unofficial reception center that is staffed , at any given time , with anywhere from 30 to 200 volunteers . Many of them are men and women who have taken vacation time to be here and offer what they can , from organizing the mounting bags of food and clothes to translating in Arabic . One woman is turned away from volunteering , told it would be unfair to the others who have placed their names on waiting lists . Another man tries to give the group cash , twice , but they reject it .\nThe images of Alan Kurdi , the dead Syrian boy washed ashore , of migrants stranded in Hungary after borders were shut , and of others suffocated in the back of a truck in Austria have washed away apathy and passive observation here . But the shock was felt viscerally , touching a historic nerve .\nIt is in Germany where a small but vicious group has led the Continent \u2019 s most violent backlash to refugees , including arson attacks on refugee centers and demonstrations for the past year by the `` anti-Islamization '' group Pegida . Such protest has been louder in eastern Germany , with high unemployment rates and less exposure to foreigners . In big cities like Munich , which has a thriving community of Turks , Albanians , and Greeks , foreigners are often seen as a source of cultural enrichment \u2013 not as burdens on schools and health systems or as sources of cultural and religious clashes .\nBut hate-fueled actions have not been limited enough to explain them away as a geographical phenomenon . And Germans across the country have been horrified as they have stirred disturbing memories of the right-wing rise of Hitler , especially in Munich , the birthplace of national socialism .\nGerman political observers say it would be wrong to view the rush of volunteerism as an act of redemption . It is rather a counter-backlash . \u201c When I saw the images of [ anti-refugee sentiment ] , I felt like people had fallen out of time , using arguments and terms and sentences which in my view reflect the ones I know from the 1920s and '30s , \u201d says Magnus Brechtken , deputy director of the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich .\nThe Willkommenskultur , then , is a defense of Germany of the 21st century .\nOr as Willbold-Vajagic in Elchingen puts it : \u201c Now we have the chance to say , \u2018 We are Germany . We are welcoming . \u2019 \u201d\nEven a decade ago , Germany wasn \u2019 t able to so easily say that . When waves of southern Europeans and Turks came to the country in the '50s and '60s , they were called \u201c guest workers \u201d because Germany expected them to go home . In the '90s , when waves of refuges came in after the Iron Curtain fell and the Balkan wars pushed so many out , the government \u2019 s position \u2013 bluntly stated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl \u2013 was that Germany is \u201c not an immigrant country . \u201d\nToday he would be wrong to say the same . Last year the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) released figures showing that Germany had surpassed all countries except the US to become the world \u2019 s No . 2 recipient of immigrants .\nIt has gotten here through both learned experience and pragmatics . Mr. Funke says the Willkommenskultur is not simply a reaction to \u201c bad memories \u201d but an authentic expression built over the decades . After the silence surrounding Nazi atrocity in the '50s , the country came to terms with what it actually meant to reject \u201c others. \u201d It learned from failing to integrate \u201c guest workers. \u201d And it learned from the riots against refugees that flared in the '90s . From that history it was able to \u201c start a dialogue \u201d with Islam a decade ago and today recognizes its role as a diverse nation .\nPerhaps more important , it also recognizes that its rapidly aging society needs those immigrants .\n\u201c The public opinion has been for a long time that additional immigrants are part of the strategy to tackle Germany \u2019 s aging problem , \u201d says Thomas Liebig , senior administrator at the OECD 's international migration division .\nGermany has liberalized its laws for foreign workers and been trying to woo high-skilled ones from as far as China . Now some see hope in refugees , too , especially high-skilled Syrian refugees . Chambers of commerce have pushed for Germany to allow businesses to more easily hire them \u2013 underlining Germany \u2019 s views that taking people in can be a boon , not a burden .\nAnd in many towns low-skilled workers are in demand as well , the kind of jobs that Mr. Liebig says \u201c people don \u2019 t move for . \u201d\nChristoph Karmann , who connects refugees to apprentices for the Chamber of Trade and Crafts for Munich and Upper Bavaria , says that in 2014 , 4,700 apprenticeship positions were vacant in Bavaria \u2019 s small trades . Jobs particularly in demand include butchers , bakers , and construction workers . Through this year they \u2019 ve filled 130 positions with young refugees from Syria , Afghanistan , and Iraq .\nIt is this economic security that has turned Germany into Europe \u2019 s leader today . And many Germans are facing the migrant rush with the optimism and confidence that befits a superpower nation .\nMathias Wendeborn closes the windows of his cheerful pediatrician practice in a wealthy community of Munich at mid-day and zips off to the gates of the city \u2019 s largest refugee center . Here he has founded the nongovernmental organization Refudocs , after pushing for two years for a full-time \u201c refugee medical practice \u201d founded on more than idealism and goodwill . It needed a \u201c concept , \u201d he says : a professional , paying structure that would stand amid ebbing emotions .\nSara Miller Llana Mathias Wendeborn ( c. ) , a pediatrician who founded Refudocs , sees his first patient of the day , the child of newly arrived asylum seekers in Munich . A translator ( far l. ) helps .\nDr. Wendenborn says the will to create this management structure was not there at first . The local government wanted to close its eyes to the problem in hopes it would go away , he says . It did not .\nBefore Refudocs was running , asylum-seekers here received care when doctors were available \u2013 a system that became unworkable amid mounting pressure on service providers across the country . Today some 70 doctors , many retired , share shifts , paid for by the state government , to keep the practice regularly humming .\n\u201c Everyone wants to help for a few weeks . But in the long-term that is not enough , \u201d Wendeborn says . \u201c This problem will accompany us for years , so we must have good standards . \u201d\nWendenborn is convinced Germany will cope , just as his practice is amid record arrivals , most of them through Munich . \u201c Seven thousand people can arrive in the Hauptbahnhof at one moment and it \u2019 s not a problem now , \u201d he says . \u201c Now they have a concept . \u201d\nAnd many are convinced Germany soon will as well . \u201c We are one of the richest countries in the world , why not ? \u201d says Wendeborn \u2019 s colleague Hilda Hadorn , who on this day alone has provided therapy to mothers who have been forced to leave their children behind in Turkey and entire families exhausted and scarred from an interminable trek . \u201c Why not ? \u201d\nBut everyone is clear that Germany can \u2019 t do it alone , and now eyes are turning to Brussels to see how it responds to Germany \u2019 s decision to close its doors temporarily . Will that spur more support for a quota system to redistribute refugees across the EU , seen here as necessary to keeping support for refugees robust ?\nAt the Hauptbahnhof on a recent weekday morning , four trains of asylum-seekers have arrived in the span of an hour .
