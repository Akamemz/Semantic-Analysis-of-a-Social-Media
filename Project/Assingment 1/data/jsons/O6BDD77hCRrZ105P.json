Bernie Sanders .\nThat national poll lists Sanders with 31 percent of support , up from 22 percent in December .\nIt shows Bloomberg spiking up to 19 percent from just 4 percent in December .\nIt shows former Vice President Joe Biden with 15 percent of support , dropping 9 points since December .\nEven though he has n't been officially running in the Iowa , New Hampshire , and Nevada contests , Bloomberg has already spent more than $ 400 million on advertising with the aim of making a big splash on Super Tuesday .\nThe socialist Sanders blasted the billionaire for spending so much money , saying , `` He thinks he can buy this election . Well , I got news for Mr. Bloomberg , and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections . ''\n`` So today we say to those billionaires who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to support candidates who represent the rich and the powerful , today we say to Mayor Bloomberg , we are a democracy , not an oligarchy .
