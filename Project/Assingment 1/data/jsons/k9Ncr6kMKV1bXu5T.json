If Congress doesn \u2019 t reach a budget agreement by then , the government will shut down for the second time in two years .\nAt the same time he warned of a potential shutdown , Mr. Obama also deepened battle lines with Republicans during his Saturday address , saying unequivocally that he \u2019 ll veto any spending bills that continue the so-called sequestration cuts or otherwise fail to make proper investments in Democratic policy priorities .\n\u201c As always , the deadline for Congress to pass a budget is the end of September . Every year . This is not new . And if they don \u2019 t , they \u2019 ll shut down the government for the second time in two years . At a time when the global economy faces headwinds and America \u2019 s economy is a relative bright spot in the world , a shutdown of our government would be wildly irresponsible .
