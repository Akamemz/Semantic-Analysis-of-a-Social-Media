It \u2019 s in the revenge fantasies that used to be reserved for sociopaths , but that now get a shrug when public personalities like actor Robert De Niro openly fantasizes about throwing a \u201c bag of s\u2014t \u201d at the president \u2019 s face , or right-wing radio host Michael Savage wishes Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be infected by the coronavirus .\nAnd yes , it \u2019 s in our media , where we devote entirely too much time to \u201c owning \u201d the other side , whether that \u2019 s slamming the left as elitist \u201c libtards \u201d or mocking the right as \u201c credulous boomer rubes. \u201d That should be beneath us .\nWhether you \u2019 re on the far left , the far right or the ever-shrinking center , this unending , level-11 vitriol is unsustainable and unbearable . No one should feel compelled to be this angry at other people all the time .\nIt feels like some of the people running for president have little desire to break this fever . They recognize that many of the people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 were motivated by anger and fear . Trump , of course , is re-invigorating that anger and fear to try to win again , and some Democratic candidates are trying their best to tap into similar veins on their side of the aisle .\nWe should ask : Do we want this climate to continue ?\nI recently interviewed businessman and Democratic candidate Andrew Yang . We talked about how a person like me \u2014 right of center and anti-Trump \u2014 might vote in November .

Now , I don \u2019 t know if Yang will be the Democratic nominee or if ultimately I could back his policies , but I don \u2019 t believe he hates people like my dad .\nElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have made their animosities known . They may couch their anger in capitalized institutions \u2014 Wall Street , Corporate America , Billionaires , Fossil Fuels \u2014 but there are people behind those institutions , from saleswomen to janitors , accountants to factory workers .\nMike Bloomberg , in his 11th hour cash-dump , has tacitly admitted that voters in Iowa , New Hampshire and other early states don \u2019 t matter . And anyone familiar with his efforts to ban or over-regulate baby formula , trans-fats , salt , sugary drinks and plenty of other legal substances knows too well his belief that ordinary folks can \u2019 t and shouldn \u2019 t make their own decisions .\nOn the other hand , Joe Biden , Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar , along with Yang , seem to be able to distinguish between disagreement and disdain , to compartmentalize policies from people .\nRespect for people you disagree with is hard to fake , and contempt is hard to mask . Case in point : When Hillary Clinton called half of Trump voters \u201c deplorables \u201d in 2016 , that moment was damaging not because it was so egregious on its face , but because it seemed to reveal something she \u2019 d been trying to hide .\nYou learn the most about a politician when they say the quiet parts out loud . In Trump \u2019 s case , he screams them . And if we \u2019 re truly tired of this , we should be wary of the candidates who similarly stoke divisiveness , who lean on the same us-versus-them instincts to sell their messages .
