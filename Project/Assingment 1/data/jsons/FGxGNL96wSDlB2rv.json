Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter , '' a mashup of a paraphrase and a quote from the civil rights leader .\nMonday , LeBron James ' life began to end as he rambled his way through an embarrassing , cowardly , tone-deaf answer about the NBA 's current conflict with China over a team executive 's pro-Hong Kong tweet ; an answer that exposed , in the most blatant way possible , that social justice is only important in the NBA when it does n't cost anything .\nJames has been publicly silent over the past week regarding Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey 's tweet , which contained an image with the words , `` Fight for freedom . Stand with Hong Kong . '' The Chinese government has taken great offense to the tweet , jeopardizing the NBA 's lucrative business relationship with the communist nation , as well as individual players ' endorsement deals .\nIn James ' comments about the controversy , he did n't talk about justice or human rights . He talked about how inconsiderate it was for Morey to support democracy in Hong Kong with a tweet that could have cost James and other players money .\n`` So many people could have been harmed , '' James said \u2014 speaking of Morey 's tweet , not of the violence being inflicted on protesters by police in Hong Kong , or the heinous human rights violations that occur in mainland China . `` Not only financially , but physically , emotionally , spiritually . So just be careful what we tweet and what we say . ''\nLater , seemingly trying to justify his answer , James tweeted about how difficult this week has been for him and his colleagues . James and the Los Angeles Lakers , as well as the Brooklyn Nets , were on a preseason tour in China when the Morey controversy began . How could Morey not have waited a week to send his tweet , so as to not make LeBron James uncomfortable ?\nThere are some players ( Enes Kanter , for example ) who walk the talk when it comes to speaking out for human rights and justice . But , by-and-large , the biggest casualty in the China/NBA spat is the NBA 's credibility on social justice .\nIn 2018 , CNN Business published a piece titled , `` The NBA is not afraid to lead on social justice . ''\nJames is prominently highlighted in the article as a social justice leader . He has spoken out against police violence against minorities . He 's worn T-shirts to support Black Lives Matter . He called President Donald Trump a `` bum . ''\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver , one of the few league figures whose cowardice on this issue has exceeded James ' , is quoted speaking of the `` sense of obligation , social responsibility , a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important '' that is `` part of being an NBA player .

''\n`` I think in this day and age , you really have to stand for something , '' Silver said in the CNN article . Silver 's great civil rights accomplishment is pulling the 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte because of the state 's transgender bathroom law .\nBut when it comes to China , when it comes to speaking out against a communist nation that oppresses its people and opposes the values of freedom that we in America view as fundamental rights , the NBA stands for nothing but its own business interests .\nThe players and executives who make millions of dollars selling shoes and apparel and TV contracts in China , the same players and executives who have no problem insulting the U.S. president , wo n't dare speak a word that might offend the Chinese .
