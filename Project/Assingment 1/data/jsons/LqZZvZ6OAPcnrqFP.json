They also contend a similar narrative failed in 2011 during the debt ceiling debate . `` It sounds to me [ what ] House Democrats are saying more and more is they 're actually rooting for a government shutdown so they can score political points . That 's the lowest of the low , '' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Dan Scarpinato told The Hill . `` The longer House Democrats refuse to be part of the solution to stopping Obamacare and reducing our debt the more voters are going to reject putting [ California Rep. ] Nancy Pelosi back in the speaker 's chair . `` To regain the majority in 2014 , Democrats would need to pick up 17 seats , a lofty goal for a midterm election , according to The Hill .",
