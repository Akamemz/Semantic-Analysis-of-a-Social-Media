A law enforcement official confirmed that the device was found near Mr. Soros \u2019 s home . It did not explode on its own , and bomb squad technicians \u201c proactively detonated \u201d it , the official said . Federal and state law enforcement officials responded to the scene in Katonah , N.Y. , a hamlet in the upscale town of Bedford in northern Westchester County , after the Bedford Police Department received a call about a suspicious package at about 3:45 p.m. \u201c An employee of the residence opened the package , revealing what appeared to be an explosive device , \u201d the police said in a statement . \u201c The employee placed the package in a wooded area and called the Bedford police . \u201d\nAnd we should do this when the target is someone on the right .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2019 s office in California was vandalized and equipment was stolen Monday evening , the Republican congressman said . In a post on his Instagram account , McCarthy published pictures of the two men he claims \u201c threw a boulder \u201c \u201d through the window of his Bakersfield office and a picture of the resulting damage . \u201c Does anyone know these two guys ? They threw a boulder thru our office window and took office equipment , \u201d McCarthy wrote Monday .\nYou \u2019 ll recall that I have a longstanding position that politically motivated violence should be blamed on the perpetrators , and more or less only the perpetrators . No one \u2019 s rant about George Soros being a sinister force behind leftist politics made somebody place a bomb in his mailbox ; somebody made the conscious decision to build that device , place it in that particular place , and commit that crime .\nBrace Yourself for a Polling Rollercoaster , Keep Your Hands and Legs Inside the Vehicle\nGoing up high ! For the first time in what seems like forever , Mike Braun has a lead in a poll over incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly ! I had been hearing a little bit of grumbling , that Braun had been gift-wrapped a perfect set of circumstances : going up against a Democrat who won with 50 percent in a presidential year ; running in a midterm in Indiana , a state Donald Trump won by 19 points , and then the incumbent voted against Brett Kavanaugh about a month before Election Day . In the other Senate race that \u2019 s comparable to this one , in North Dakota , Kevin Cramer is beating Heidi Heitkamp by 16 points .\nBut wait , SurveyUSA had Donnelly ahead by a point yesterday !\nThe latest Washington Post poll has the vote even in the swing districts that Republicans need to hold !\nThe latest survey shows only a marginal change in the race during October , with 50 percent currently supporting the Democratic candidate in their district and 47 percent backing the Republican . Candidates from the two parties collectively are running almost even in 48 contested congressional districts won by President Trump in 2016 , while Democrats hold the advantage in 21 competitive districts won by Hillary Clinton . The Democrats \u2019 lead in those Clinton districts has narrowed a bit since the beginning of the month . The overwhelming majority of the districts surveyed \u2014 63 of the 69 \u2014 are currently represented by a Republican in the House .\nBut hold on , if they split those 48 congressional districts evenly , Democrats would win 24 \u2014 which is exactly what they need for 218-seat majority . If they fall short anywhere , they end up falling just short of a majority , barring some huge upset in some race currently considered safe for Republicans . And this calculation doesn \u2019 t include those six House seats held by Democrats . For what it \u2019 s worth , Republicans feel pretty good about their odds in Minnesota \u2019 s first district , Minnesota \u2019 s eighth district , and maybe Nevada \u2019 s third district . So Democrats probably want to win 27 or 28 out of those most competitive 48 to ensure that they win the majority .\nAs Alexandra DeSanctis observes , three polls of Florida \u2019 s statewide races came out , and two of them are bad for Republicans , and one of them is good . It would seem odd for Scott to slide in the polls as he \u2019 s spending his days primarily focused on directing the state \u2019 s response to Hurricane Michael ; these are usually the sorts of moments where governors look their best .

Less than an hour after his defeat in the Los Angeles lawsuit , Avenatti suffered another setback at a trial in Orange County : The Irvine Co. won a court order evicting him and his staff from their offices because the firm , Eagan Avenatti , skipped the last four months of rent .\nAs the political climate continues to heat up , challenger Scott Wallace lost his cool during a debate with Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick .
