    "content": "Their defenses of campus kangaroo courts are rife with transparently bad statistics .\nHonestly , even for a person who \u2019 s been hardened by decades of campus ideological and legal battles , it \u2019 s hard to believe how thoroughly unhinged , how intellectually bankrupt is the argument against protecting due process on campus . Yesterday , Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced that the Trump administration would shortly begin a regulatory rulemaking process designed to protect college students from sexual assault while also protecting the fundamental constitutional rights of the accused .\nMore precisely , DeVos signaled her intention to withdraw the Obama administration \u2019 s 2011 \u201c Dear Colleague \u201d letter that unilaterally and lawlessly required universities to adjudicate sexual-assault claims under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard ( the accused is responsible if there \u2019 s a 50.1 percent probability he committed the crime ) but without protecting due process . Obama \u2019 s policy resulted in a kangaroo-court system where accused students often don \u2019 t have access to counsel , the ability to effectively cross-examine their accuser ( indeed , the Obama admin specifically urged that accused students not be permitted to cross-examine accusers ) , or even access to all the evidence in the case .\nJudging from the Twitter reaction to DeVos \u2019 s remarks , you would have thought that she \u2019 d declared open season on young women on campus . Under the hashtag # StopBetsy , ideologues and celebrities declared that DeVos was taking the \u201c next step on our path to authoritarianism. \u201d Or , in the words of the reasonable non-hysterical folks at the Women \u2019 s March , she was \u201c making campuses safer for rapists. \u201d The makers of a deeply flawed campus-rape documentary called \u201c The Hunting Ground \u201d slammed DeVos , saying , \u201c Her proposal should scare the hell out of every parent in this country with a college bound child \u2014 schools will become much more dangerous places for their children . \u201d\nBut what is this terrible proposal ? While the details are yet to be revealed , from her remarks it \u2019 s clear that she wants to protect students from sexual assault and to protect students from kangaroo courts . In other words , she may well require schools to protect students \u2019 ability to employ counsel , cross-examine witnesses , see the evidence against them , and try their cases before a truly impartial tribunal . This is basic stuff . It \u2019 s the essence of due process , and it \u2019 s unthinkable for any person facing such serious , state-mandated charges to face justice without these basic protections .\nSo , what \u2019 s the objection ? Why do some activists seemingly come unglued at the mere mention of \u201c due process \u201d ?\nTo put it simply , it \u2019 s because many of them believe and propagate a pile of junk science seasoned with a heaping helping of far-left ideology . This toxic combination causes them to believe the following fantastical story : That one in five women on campus will be sexually assaulted at some point in their college careers , that virtually no woman would lie or be mistaken in alleging a sexual assault , and that even the absence of evidence is somehow evidence of rape . In these circumstances , due process is at best a mere formality . At worst , it \u2019 s the rapist \u2019 s friend .\nBut that story is wrong \u2014 terribly wrong \u2014 and it \u2019 s facilitating injustice on a national scale .\nFirst , the one-in-five statistic is based on seriously flawed studies that , among other things , improperly define sexual assault or base their findings on a low-response survey of two colleges . In fact , the authors of arguably the most influential source for the one-in-five statistic have explicitly said that it was \u201c inappropriate \u201d to use their survey as a \u201c baseline \u201d for campus rape .\nTheir story is wrong \u2014 terribly wrong \u2014 and it \u2019 s facilitating injustice on a national scale .\nIn 2014 , the Department of Justice \u2019 s Bureau of Justice Statistics released its own , more rigorous survey , and its results were far , far different . It found that the rate of rape and sexual assault was \u201c higher for nonstudents than for students. \u201d The annual rate of sexual assault for young women enrolled in college was 6.1 per 1,000 , or less than 1 percent . Too high , but far from the extraordinary and shocking crisis of one-in-five , even when tallied over multiple years .\nBut what about the notion that \u201c women don \u2019 t lie about rape , \u201d often memorialized in the # BelieveAllWomen hashtag \u2014 popularized by none other than Hillary Clinton herself ? That \u2019 s based on flawed research as well . Here \u2019 s Emily Yoffe , writing yesterday in The Atlantic :\nAs Michelle J. Anderson , the president of Brooklyn College and a scholar of rape law , acknowledged in a 2004 paper in the Boston University Law Review , \u201c There is no good empirical data on false rape complaints either historically or currently. \u201d The data have not improved since that time . In a 2015 working paper , Lieutenant Colonel Reggie Yager , a U.S. Air Force judge advocate who has defended men accused of sexual assault , took a comprehensive look at the research on the incidence of false rape reports , and concluded that the studies confirming the overwhelming veracity of accusers are methodologically unsound .\nFor example , in one widely cited study , the author claimed that \u201c over 90 percent \u201d of rape claims weren \u2019 t fabrications . Yet in that author \u2019 s own research , \u201c about 45 percent of the cases [ he ] reviewed did not proceed because there was insufficient evidence , or the complainant withdrew from the process or couldn \u2019 t identify the perpetrator , or the allegation did not rise to the level of a sexual assault. \u201d As Yoffe says , \u201c we simply don \u2019 t know \u201d how rare false claims are .\nFinally , the junk research doesn \u2019 t stop with surveys .
