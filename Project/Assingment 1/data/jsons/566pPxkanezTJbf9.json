This is part of the reason that the average wait of more than two years to see a judge \u2013 a wait that can stretch to five years \u2013 remains unacceptable for the Trump administration .\nBut others are concerned that Trump \u2019 s expansion of the expedited removal process is likely to deprive undocumented immigrants of their constitutional right to due process , which has been established by court precedents .
