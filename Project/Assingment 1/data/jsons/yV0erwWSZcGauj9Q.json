    "content": "The topsy-turvy Democratic primary for president dominated political news for the first two-and-a-half months of 2020 \u2014 and rightfully so , it was bonkers \u2014 but now that it \u2019 s settled down , it \u2019 s time for us to check in once again on the other major political battle of 2020 : the fight for the U.S. Senate .\nRepublicans started the cycle with the advantage , but Democrats have had reason for optimism of late . New polls have shown Democratic challengers ahead of GOP incumbents , the party is recruiting strong candidates , and , perhaps most importantly given the tight correlation between presidential and Senate voting , former Vice President Joe Biden , the Democrat who has polled the best against President Trump , has become the party \u2019 s likely presidential nominee .\nThe most likely outcome is still that Republicans maintain control of the Senate , though perhaps with a reduced majority : The status quo favors them , and most of the states where the Senate will be decided lean red . ( As a refresher , Republicans currently have 53 Senate seats to Democrats \u2019 47 , meaning Democrats need to flip four seats , on net , to take control \u2014 or three if they also win the vice presidency . ) But Democrats have expanded the map to the point where they have a lot more pick-up opportunities than Republicans do , so they have a lot of upside .\nDemocrats have pick-up opportunities in the Senate Competitive U.S. Senate seats up for election in 2020 , as rated by three major election handicappers State Incumbent Incumbent Party Rating Minnesota Tina Smith D Likely D New Hampshire Jeanne Shaheen D Likely D New Mexico OPEN D Likely D Michigan Gary Peters D Lean D Arizona * Martha McSally R Toss-up Colorado Cory Gardner R Toss-up North Carolina Thom Tillis R Toss-up Maine Susan Collins R Toss-up/Lean R Alabama Doug Jones D Lean R Georgia * Kelly Loeffler R Lean R Iowa Joni Ernst R Lean R Kansas OPEN R Lean R Montana Steve Daines R Lean R Georgia David Perdue R Likely R Kentucky Mitch McConnell R Likely R Texas John Cornyn R Likely R Rating is the race \u2019 s median rating among the Cook Political Report , Inside Elections and Sabato \u2019 s Crystal Ball . Races with a median rating of Solid D or Solid R are excluded . * Special election . Sources : Cook Political Report , Inside Elections , Sabato \u2019 s Crystal Ball\nThe most competitive Senate races remain unchanged from late last year \u2014 there haven \u2019 t been any significant developments in Colorado or Maine , for example , that have dislodged them from their too-close-to-call status . Instead , the biggest Senate news of the last couple months came in the longer-shot Democratic pick-up opportunity of Montana , where Gov . Steve Bullock \u2019 s entry has shaken up the race . Bullock was considered to be the only Democrat who could put this red state in play , and his announcement caused nonpartisan handicappers to move the race from \u201c Solid Republican \u201d to \u201c Lean Republican . \u201d\nAccording to Morning Consult , Bullock has a +21 net approval rating ( approval rating minus disapproval rating ) and at least 83 percent of Montanans are able to form an opinion of him ( approval rating plus disapproval rating ) . This gives him a leg up against incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines ( who has just a +16 net approval rating and at least 78 percent name recognition , according to the same poll ) . Indeed , Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling put out a survey shortly after Bullock entered the race that found Bullock and Daines deadlocked at 47 percent support . However , the poll was sponsored by liberal group End Citizens United , which has endorsed Bullock , so you should take it with a grain of salt .\nThe special election in Georgia has also seen a flurry of new candidates . After now-Sen. Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the vacant seat instead of Republican Rep. Doug Collins , Collins announced in late January that he would challenge her in November \u2019 s jungle primary . ( Unlike a normal Georgia election , all candidates in the special election , regardless of party , will run on the same ballot in November ; then , if no one gets a majority , the top two finishers advance to a runoff . ) But Collins isn \u2019 t the only one entering the fray . Democrat Matt Lieberman , the son of former Sen. Joe Lieberman , has been running since last year , and fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor at Atlanta \u2019 s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church , announced in late January that he would run . The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly endorsed Warnock . Then , in February , former U.S. Attorney Ed Tarver became the third prominent Democrat to join the race .\nWith both the Republican and Democratic vote splintered among several candidates , it now seems extremely likely that the race will advance to a runoff election in January . And unfortunately for Democrats , there \u2019 s a chance they get locked out of a runoff completely : Several early polls of the race ( granted , only one of which was nonpartisan ) showed Collins and Loeffler finishing first and second in the jungle primary . However , if a Democrat does make it through to the runoff , he might find Collins or Loeffler to be a relatively soft target . Collins \u2019 s hardline conservative views may make him a poor fit for an increasingly moderate state like Georgia , while Loeffler has faced a firestorm of criticism since it was revealed she sold millions of dollars in stocks after she received a briefing on the dangers of the coronavirus . In fact , one GOP pollster has shown her losing ground in the last few weeks \u2014 although , as always , we shouldn \u2019 t read too much into just one poll .\nMeanwhile , handicappers still rate Arizona as a toss-up , but there \u2019 s an increasingly strong argument that Democrats are actually favored despite the state \u2019 s Republican lean . Five polls of Arizona \u2019 s U.S. Senate race have been conducted so far in March , and Democrat Mark Kelly led Republican Sen. Martha McSally in all five . His average lead was 7 percentage points .\nDemocrat Mark Kelly leads in recent Arizona polls Public polls of Arizona \u2019 s U.S. Senate race conducted in March 2020 Results Dates Pollster Sample Kelly ( D ) McSally ( R ) Margin March 2-3 Public Policy Polling 666 V 47 % 42 % D+5 March 3-4 OH Predictive Insights 600 LV 49 42 D+7 March 6-11 Latino Decisions 1036 RV 48 36 D+12 March 10-15 Marist College 2523 RV 48 45 D+3 March 11-14 Monmouth University 847 RV 50 44 D+6 Average 48 42 D+7 Source : Polls\nOf course , contrarians need only recall the fate of former Tallahassee , Florida , Mayor Andrew Gillum in 2018 : He led almost every poll of the Florida governor \u2019 s race yet still went down to defeat . Even a small systematic polling error in Arizona could mean that McSally is actually ahead ( most of those Kelly leads are within the margin of error ) . However , Kelly also has the advantage of being a monster fundraiser \u2014 he took in more than $ 20.2 million in 2019 . McSally raised only $ 12.6 million .\nFinally , the first few Senate battlegrounds have now held their primaries , which means we have a clearer picture of who will face off in the fall . In North Carolina , former state Sen. Cal Cunningham , who had the support of the DSCC , won the Democratic primary with 57 percent of the vote . That sets up a close general election with Republican Sen. Thom Tillis : A survey by Democratic firm Public Policy Polling claims Cunningham is ahead , while Tillis \u2019 s pollster gave the incumbent the lead .\nAnd in Texas , Republican Sen. John Cornyn \u2019 s Democratic opponent will be either DSCC-endorsed veteran MJ Hegar or state Sen. Royce West . After finishing first and second , in the March 3 primary , the two Democrats will face off in a July 14 runoff that was delayed two months by the coronavirus pandemic . ( This could be a problem for Democrats , as their eventual nominee will be forced to spend time and money on an extended intraparty fight rather than stockpiling enough cash to compete with Cornyn in this very expensive state . )\nAlso on July 14 ( and also months later than originally scheduled ) , Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama will find out if his Republican opponent will be former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville or former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions . Tuberville and Sessions finished neck and neck in the first round of the GOP primary on March 3 , but Tuberville may have the advantage in the runoff : He leads in multiple polls , and Trump , still nursing a grudge against Sessions for not protecting him from the Mueller probe , formally endorsed Tuberville a couple weeks ago .\nNo matter who wins , though , things look dire for Jones . In a Mason-Dixon poll from early February , Tuberville led the Democrat by 8 percentage points , and Sessions led him by 13 points . Democrats \u2019 best chance at holding onto this seat likely went out the window after former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore \u2014 whose profound flaws as a candidate allowed Jones to first win this seat back in 2017 \u2014 failed in his comeback bid ; he finished fourth with just 7 percent in the GOP primary earlier this month .\nWith seven months to go until Election Day , though , there is still a lot that can change \u2014 in these races and others . The overall race for the Senate could still go either way , and we \u2019 ll of course keep you updated .",
