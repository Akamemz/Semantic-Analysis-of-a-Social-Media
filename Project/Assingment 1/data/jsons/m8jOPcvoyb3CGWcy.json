    "content": "Newman , who came within 2,200 votes of ousting Lipinski in 2018 , crafted a formidable and well-funded campaign operation for the rematch . Her turnout operation knocked over 100,000 doors and she nabbed early endorsements from nearly every high-profile progressive , including Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) .\nThat support helped Newman tap a groundswell of grassroots donors from around the country . She raised upwards of $ 1.6 million and was outspending Lipinski by a two-to-one margin on the air .\nA coalition of women \u2019 s groups , including EMILY \u2019 s List and NARAL Pro-Choice , funneled $ 1 million into TV ads to help Newman , but Lipinski was left to fend for himself on the airwaves , a dynamic that made his team nervous heading into the election .\nIn a statement Tuesday night , NARAL President Ilyse Hogue hailed the victory as a `` culmination of years of work to unseat an entrenched incumbent . ''\n`` Voters across the country are in no mind to stand by as their elected officials throw women and families under the bus , '' she said .\nLipinski did not concede until Wednesday afternoon . `` As the numbers stand right now , it appears that I will not prevail , '' he said in a news conference . He called Newman to congratulate her .\nIn his remarks , Lipinski slammed the lack of space in the Democratic Party for those who oppose abortion rights and the outside money that mobilized against him , but he admitted his position may have contributed to his defeat .\n`` I could never give up protecting the most vulnerable human beings in the world simply to win an election , '' he said .\nThere were some serious warning signs for the incumbent in the buildup to Tuesday night .

''\nYet Lipinski pitched himself as in line with the district \u2019 s voters and cast Newman as too extreme , citing her support for `` Medicare for All '' and the Green New Deal .\n`` We should remain focused on what \u2019 s important , \u201d he told reporters in an interview last week in the Capitol . \u201c What really holds us all together as Democrats : the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress .
