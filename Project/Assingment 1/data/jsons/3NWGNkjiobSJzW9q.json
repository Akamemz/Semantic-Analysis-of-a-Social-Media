Still , since not every conversation needs to be about The Most Important Thing in the World Right Now , we should talk about it .\nIf you are familiar with The Breakfast Club , you know Charlemagne doesn \u2019 t throw softballs . It was a challenging interview for Biden , during which he was tested on matters including : whether his polling lead over Trump is an illusion , as we saw in 2016 ( \u201c totally different , man , \u201d Biden protested ) ; the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on black communities ; Biden \u2019 s marijuana sentencing policies ; and black voters \u2019 displeasure over Thursday \u2019 s news that Amy Klobuchar is being vetted for his running mate . ( \u201c I guarantee you : There are multiple black women being considered . Multiple , \u201d Biden replied . )\nAfter that answer , an offscreen aide cut off the interview for time . Charlemagne , seemingly both joking and not , said , \u201c You can \u2019 t do that to black media ! \u201d With a smile , Biden offered that he does the same to white media as well , saying that his wife , Dr. Jill Biden , needed the feed .
