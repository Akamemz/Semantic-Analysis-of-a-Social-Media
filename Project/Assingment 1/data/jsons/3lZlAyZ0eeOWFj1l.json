    "content": "In a dramatic Sunday in Bolivia , President Evo Morales first offered to call new elections , and then chose to resign after the military called for him to step down . The events marked an escalation after weeks of violent protests that had mounted over his contested re-election last month .\nMorales , 60 , had led Bolivia since 2006 , making him the longest-serving current head of state in Latin America . The country \u2019 s first indigenous leader , he oversaw an economic boom , a massive reduction in poverty and strides in social equality , earning him high approval ratings and three consecutive election wins .\nBut protesters accused Morales , a left-wing union leader and former coca farmer , of attempting to manipulate the results of the Oct. 20 national elections . He claimed to have won a fourth term outright , despite preliminary results indicating the need for a second round run off with his rightwing rival .\nThousands of Bolivians took to the streets , sometimes clashing violently with Morales \u2019 political allies . Morales agreed to hold fresh elections after electoral observers refused to verify his victory , but in a crucial blow to the president , the country \u2019 s military chief joined calls for his resignation Sunday .\nMorales has denied any wrongdoing and claims to be the victim of a \u201c civic coup \u201d organized by rightwing political forces and backed by the armed forces . But he said he was resigning to prevent further bloodshed , fulfilling his \u201c obligation , as indigenous president and president of all Bolivians , to seek peace. \u201d Here \u2019 s what to know about his resignation .\nBefore Morales won his first election in 2005 , Bolivia \u2019 s indigenous people \u2014 who make up at least 42 % of the population according to the 2012 census ( the government estimates it could be higher ) \u2014 had struggled to win rights and representation from a political class dominated by wealthy families of European descent .\nMorales , who hails from the large Aymara group , expanded freedoms for indigenous communities and legal protections for their cultures . He also delivered a sharp increase in living standards , improving access to electricity , sewerage and water services .\nEconomists say Morales responded to Latin America \u2019 s commodities boom more successfully than other governments in the region , marshalling Bolivia \u2019 s gas and mineral riches into fuel for both social programs and businesses . Bolivia remains South America \u2019 s poorest country after crisis-stricken Venezuela , but poverty fell from 60 % in 2006 to 36 % in 2017 , while per capita GDP grew from $ 1,200 to over $ 3,350 in the same period .\nBut Morales \u2019 relationship with the public began to sour in 2016 , when he asked voters to approve the abolition of presidential term limits . Voters narrowly rejected Morales \u2019 proposal . The president then turned to the constitutional court , dominated by his allies , which ruled that term limits violated human rights , paving the way for him to run for a fourth term this year . Since then critics have accused Morales of trying to turn Bolivia into an authoritarian state , also citing corruption scandals and the persecution of political opponents .\nThe live vote counting after national elections on Oct. 20 showed Morales in the lead , but just short of the 10 point lead he needed to win outright . The opposition celebrated the chance to go to a second round in December , in which their candidate , the right-wing former president Carlos Mesa , would have had a chance at unseating Morales .\nBut then Bolivia \u2019 s electoral board abruptly suspended the vote count for 24 hours . When it began again , the results showed Morales with 46.85 % to Mesa \u2019 s 36.73 % , just enough of a lead to avoid a run off .
