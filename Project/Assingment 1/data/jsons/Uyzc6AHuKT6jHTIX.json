    "content": "Nobody is talking about it , but the professions are collapsing . And as they collapse , they will take a certain kind of center-left progressivism with them . There will be some sort of liberal left in the future , but it probably will not resemble the school of progressivism familiar from Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama , a school rooted in the professional class .\nFor more than a century , the American upper middle class has been divided between \u201c professionals \u201d and \u201c managers. \u201d The elite professions\u2014doctors , lawyers and professors\u2014have shared several characteristics . Although professionals may choose to specialize , they are essentially generalists . The ideal professional is self-employed or works with partners , instead of working in a corporate or public bureaucracy . Doctors and lawyers , though not professors , are paid fees for specific services to specific clients , not wages . Membership of the profession is limited , both by requirements that practitioners obtain expensive credentials and by politically influential cartels\u2014the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , the American Bar Association ( ABA ) . The credentials and the cartels artificially restrict the supply of practitioners , driving up their fees .\nContrast the managers . While some are self-employed , most work in corporate hierarchies . They have far less control over their schedules and jobs than independent professionals . Within the firm , they usually specialize in finance or human resources or marketing . They are paid wages and sometimes stock options , tying their remuneration to the success of the firm and the industry . The educational requirements of managers are lower than those of professionals . Many do well with B.A.s , and the MBA program takes only two years . There is no cartel for managers like the AMA or ABA , and nothing like state bar or medical licensing exams .\nThe differences in working conditions are reflected in different worldviews . American academics and lawyers , and to some degree doctors , tend to see themselves as having special professional responsibilities to the public as a whole , rather like civil servants , in a way that American business executives do not . This claim to the exercise of a public trust justifies the privilege of self-regulation by professional associations .\nIn the 20th century , some services like goods production and entertainment came to be industrialized and provided by corporations , while others like medicine and law and higher education continued to be supplied by generalist professionals working alone or in partnerships . Many doctors would use the same hospital , or as many professors would inhabit the same campus , without being employees in the sense that someone who works for IBM is an IBM employee .\nAll of this is changing , as a result of technology and new business models .\nThe Internet combined with advanced software is eliminating one traditional role of doctors and lawyers : accessing information buried in medical treatises or rows of legal volumes . The need for informed interpretation remains . Even so , anyone with access to WebMD and similar websites is pretty well equipped for self-diagnosis for many simple maladies . And LegalZoom and similar firms have software that can help people write their own wills and other documents .\nWhat remains are legally enforced cartels and monopolies in medicine and the law , governing who can authorize prescription drugs and who can argue cases in court . But sooner or later these guild monopolies may come to be viewed as anachronistic and eradicated by legislation .\nThe professions will be replaced , not by universal amateurism , but by the extension of the corporate model to the fields of medicine , law and perhaps higher education . Doctors will be replaced by medical services corporations , lawyers by legal services firms . There will continue to be legal standards and regulations , but the subject of regulation , as in other industries , will be the firm as a whole , not the independent practitioner .\nIn American medicine , the transition is already well underway . American physicians are rapidly abandoning private practice for salaried jobs with hospitals and other employers .
