    "content": "Now , he says , people are being forced to get to know their neighbors \u2013 no matter who they voted for \u2013 and find out if they are OK .\nThe shut-downs have become a \u201c civic engagement trigger that \u2019 s very different from how we live our lives , tucked away in our own homes , on our iPhones with Amazon , where you don \u2019 t need to know your neighbor , \u201d says state Sen. Henry Stern .\nThat door-knocking is the kind of community effort that Californians are adopting in the wake of unprecedented pre-disaster blackouts that utilities say could last a decade . Around 2 million Californians lost power over the weekend as Pacific Gas & Electric cut electricity in a planned \u201c public safety power shut-off , \u201d while 180,000 residents fled the Kincade fire . Another mass outage is expected Tuesday .\nIn California , churches are figuring out who in their congregation needs special help , phone trees are being activated , and grandchildren are checking on grandparents . Charging stations , where residents can power cellphones and laptops , have been available during outages . Homeowners with solar batteries are running extension cords for neighbors and offering space in freezers . In Marin County , a team of seven student nurses and an emergency medical technician knocked on doors of \u201c medically fragile \u201d people .\nCalifornia is under a state of emergency , ordering evacuations , battling fast-burning fires , and dealing with massive preemptive power outages . It is experienced with the evacuations and firefighting , which is complicated by seasonal high winds . The power outages , on the other hand , are something new here in the northern part of the state .\nAround 2 million people lost power over the weekend as the mammoth utility , Pacific Gas & Electric , cut electricity in a planned \u201c public safety power shut-off. \u201d It is the second round of mass outages in less than a month , with another expected on Tuesday .\nThe utility , which sought bankruptcy protection due to the threat of suits from past fires , calls the outages the \u201c new normal , \u201d necessary to prevent its equipment from sparking a catastrophic fire under high-wind and bone-dry conditions . The fire-season shut-offs , says PG & E , could last a decade as it seeks to modernize its vast network .\nIf this is the new normal , it has broad implications for the vitality of the world \u2019 s fifth-largest economy \u2013 and for the people who live here . A big concern is that the outages will exacerbate inequity in the state . Those who can afford to independently power their homes and businesses with generators and energy-battery storage will do so , while vulnerable populations and mom-and-pop businesses are at risk .\n\u201c Rich people in California are going to go in that direction , and the real question is how should we help low-income people respond to this challenge , \u201d says Michael Wara , director of Stanford University \u2019 s climate and energy policy program . \u201c People are just beginning to understand the magnitude of the [ blackout ] impacts . \u201d\nThe challenge is evident here at the foot of Mount Tamalpais State Park , affectionately known as \u201c Mt . Tam , \u201d just north of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge . In Mill Valley , where Mr. Wara lives , several of his neighbors have solar power , including Jim Budish , who runs an insurance business out of his home .\nUnbeknownst to many solar homeowners , however , panels are useless when the power grid goes down . Energy needs to be stored in batteries in order to keep flowing . That \u2019 s why , when Mr. Budish began to get notices about the possibility of frequent power outages , he invested in two Tesla batteries .\nThe batteries , large white panels mounted on the wall inside a garage shared with bikes and surfing body boards , were not cheap . Installation , plus other equipment , came to $ 17,000 , which will be offset by a 25 % tax break .\nStill , when they got their first test a couple of weeks ago , not even his digital clocks blinked to indicate a temporary outage . He and his wife , who works with him , were able to run their five-bedroom home as before \u2013 the lights , the freezer , the pool pump . It worked seamlessly again when the power went out Saturday .\nThere is one major drawback : He has no internet , which seems to be connected to the grid . He uses his cell phone as a wi-fi \u201c hot spot \u201d but that \u2019 s proven unreliable . Without the internet , he headed to San Francisco Monday morning in search of a Starbucks so he could work \u2013 the reason he got his Tesla \u201c power wall \u201d in the first place .\nStill , his neighbors with solar have been asking about his set-up . In fact , before this latest outage , one visited his garage . \u201c He \u2019 s like , \u2018 How do I get this ? Right now ? \u2019 \u201d\nMr. Budish has energy to spare , and that sparks a question for him : Why can \u2019 t he share his extra power with his neighbors \u2013 or with those less well-off ?\n\u201c This may sound a little out of this world , \u201d he ventures , waxing philosophical . \u201c I look at energy that people use in their everyday lives kind of like health care . Everybody should have it . There shouldn \u2019 t be someone who doesn \u2019 t have power to their home because they can \u2019 t afford it . \u201d\nAnn Hermes/Staff From left , Carla Wade , Demetriuse Coleman , and Kathy Duquia talk outside an apartment complex on Oct. 24 , 2019 , in Marin City , California .\nThe residents of Marin City couldn \u2019 t agree more . Less than a 10-minute drive from Mr. Budish \u2019 s house , this community was once a diverse , thriving town that attracted African Americans and others to work in a nearby shipyard in World War II .\nWhen that closed , job and housing discrimination prevented black families from moving . Today , this is a heavily African American , poor community , with no local grocery store , and many residents live in subsidized housing . They are surrounded by some of the highest-priced real estate in the nation .\nLast week , women who live in the town \u2019 s Golden Gate Village apartments , sitting on the steps of their low-slung apartment houses , shared stories of what it was like when the power went off for the first time earlier that month .\nMany people , they said , had just gotten their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money and spent it on groceries . All of the perishables had to be thrown out . The weekly food pantry across the street , run by St. Andrew Presbyterian Church , also closed . Although it \u2019 s possible to apply for a food-stamp reimbursement , not everyone knows that .\n\u201c Who can afford to lose food ? I hate to throw away food , \u201d says Kathy Duquia , who lives on Supplemental Security Income , a federal program designed to help senior citizens , blind people , or people with disabilities who have little to no income .\nEven worse was the $ 807 that Carla Wade had to spend on medicine that needed to be cooled . It was spoiled when her fridge cut off . Neither PG & E nor her health insurance could help her , she says .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t give a rat \u2019 s tail about us , \u201d says Ms. Duquia .\nAnn Hermes/Staff From left , Shronda Cage and Felecia Gaston of Performing Stars stand in front of a fresh produce truck that brings fruits and vegetables to the park once a week on Oct. 24 , 2019 in Marin City , California . Ms. Gaston helped organize a community dinner for residents during the first blackout . Ms. Cage describes the power outages as \u201c devastating , \u201d while Ms. Gaston sees them as an inconvenience .\nNationally , studies confirm the inequities of disasters , including after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf in 2005 . According to an independent study by the Congressional Research Service , Katrina had a disproportionate effect on minorities and poor people living in the region . \u201c Hurricane Katrina likely made one of the poorest areas of the country even poorer , \u201d the report says .\nMr. Wara says this has come up frequently in the hearings of California Gov . Gavin Newsom \u2019 s Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery , of which Mr. Wara is a member . After a fire hits and a town has to rebuild , the effects on low-income Californians is \u201c much more severe , \u201d he says . They don \u2019 t have insurance . They don \u2019 t have living assistance after their home burns .\nAfter a fire , rents get bid up , as they did when Santa Rosa suffered a destructive fire in 2017 , he says . That region is again under siege with the Kincade fire , which has burned more than 66,000 acres and caused the evacuation of at least 180,000 people . \u201c It magnifies inequality , \u201d he says .\nBut rebuilding after a destructive hurricane , fire , or flood is not the same as dealing with widespread blackouts , says California state Sen. Henry Stern . The senator , who represents Malibu , lives in a district that has seen four destructive fires in three years \u2013 including the Saddleridge and Tick fires this month . Though not close to the scale of PG & E , Southern California Edison is also practicing public-safety power shut-offs , with about 25,000 customers without power as of Monday morning .\n\u201c Nothing is similar to this preemptive , before-the-disaster strikes \u201d situation , the senator says , describing it as a new frontier . \u201c There \u2019 s a group of [ legislators ] who have all been hit by these fires . We \u2019 re kind of banging our heads against the wall , to be honest . \u201d\nGovernor Newsom has put together a new team to help lessen the impact of planned blackouts and announced $ 75 million for local and state governments to mitigate their effects .\nLast week , state Sen. Stern and other lawmakers put out a framework for action that includes an aggressive shift toward community-based solutions that also help the most vulnerable , for whom keeping the power on is a matter of life and death . This includes a rapid move toward \u201c microgrids , \u201d very local sources of power that can run essential services like hospitals , nursing homes , and firehouses . Senators will return from recess to hold a hearing on the issue on Nov. 18 .\n\u201c In my view , we need to identify everyone who is vulnerable down to a T , whether it is individuals at home or in a nursing facility or getting in-home care , \u201d he says . \u201c They ought to have access to solar and storage or fuel cells . \u201d\nSimply identifying \u2013 and alerting \u2013 especially vulnerable individuals is a task in and of itself . In Marin County , officials have found that many more medically fragile people need help beyond PG & E \u2019 s list of self-reported \u201c medical baseline \u201d customers who have signed up to receive discount rates and extra alerts about pending power outages .\nBy declaring a local health emergency at the first big power outage Oct. 9 , Marin County health officials gained access to a federal database of Medicare patients who rely on equipment such as ventilators that need power to work . PG & E \u2019 s list reported 211 customers in need ; the federal list had 324 \u2013 and even that was incomplete .\nThe county sent a team of seven student nurses , plus an emergency medical technician for oversight , to knock on doors of the \u201c medically fragile \u201d people on the federal list .\nThat door-knocking is the kind of community effort that Californians are adopting while politicians , regulators , utilities , and the private sector work toward more permanent solutions .\nIn Marin City , a group of community leaders organized a public barbecue at the town park during the first prescribed blackout \u2013 just in time for the return of power to turn the event into a celebration . Charging stations , where residents can power cell phones , laptops , and even electric generators , have been available during both outages .\nMr. Budish , meanwhile , loaned his gas generator to his neighbor across the street , ran an extension cord to his side neighbor , and offered his freezer to people who might need it .\nMr. Stern says that in his district , churches are figuring out who in their congregation needs special help , phone trees are being activated , and grandchildren are checking on grandparents .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
