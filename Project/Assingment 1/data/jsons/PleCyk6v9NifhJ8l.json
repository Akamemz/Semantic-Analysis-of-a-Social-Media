    "content": "We have two tales now . One is that CNN scripted a question for a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student , who survived the horrific shooting last Wednesday that left 17 people dead and at least a dozen wounded . The other is CNN \u2019 s version of events . The network says they did not script anything ; the student \u2019 s father withdrew his name from the list of those who wished to ask questions at the town hall event , and the reason for that was because the student wanted to give a speech .\nIt was first reported that Colton Haab , the student who made the allegation , wanted to ask a question centering on hiring military veterans as armed security at schools .\nThere is absolutely no truth to this . CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night 's town hall , nor have we ever . After seeing an interview with Colton Haab , we invited him to participate in our town hall along with other students and administrators from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . Colton \u2019 s father withdrew his name from participation before the forum began , which we regretted but respected . We welcome Colton to join us on CNN today to discuss his views on school safety . [ \u2026 ] According to a CNN insider Haab wanted to give an extensive speech and not just ask a question , something the network said the forum was not designed for . When the family was told this they decided to pull out of the event . The CNNer also noted the subject Haab wanted to address , arming teachers , was discussed at length in the 2-hour long town hall .\nYet , despite CNN pretty much calling him a liar , Haab double down on his story with Fox News \u2019 Tucker Carlson . He said a female CNN producer , contacted him four days ago , she wanted him to write a speech for the town hall event in Sunrise , Florida . He agreed . On the next day , the CNN employee said she wanted more questions rather than a speech . Haab was fine with that and complied . The day after that , CNN just wanted questions , he submitted his questions , and then he said around 5:15 P.M. yesterday\u2014he made contact with the network and she wanted just one question . It \u2019 s here that he realized they had scripted one from his based on a past interview with the network , where he said he supported teachers arming themselves ( via RCP ) :\nCOLTON HAAB : So what had happened was four days ago I had gotten contacted by a lady named [ State of the Union executive producer ] Carrie Stevenson from CNN . She had asked me originally to just write a speech . It was going to be at the town hall at the BB & T Center [ in Sunrise , Florida ] . So I agreed . I felt like it would be the right thing to do . Be able to go speak my part as well as open eyes to a few things that I thought that can make this situation a little better . From there , three days ago , so the next day after that I had gotten an email back from her and she asked for more of questions rather than a speech . Which I was totally fine with so I wrote a little less of a speech and more of questions that I wanted to ask at the town hall . The day after that it was more of just questions . She asked for just questions that I would like to ask . So , I gave her my questions and then yesterday , at about 5:15 , I made contact with her . And she had asked if I had just asked her one question . So what they had actually done was wrote out a question for me because in my interview with CNN , I had talked about arming the teachers , if they were willing to arm themselves in the school to carry on campus . And they had -- she had taken that of what I had briefed on and actually wrote that question out for me . So I have that question here if you would like me to ask it for you .\nWhen Tucker asked if CNN used their words , not Haab \u2019 s , to craft a question\u2014the student said , \u201c absolutely . \u201d\n\u201c It definitely did and that \u2019 s kind of why I didn \u2019 t go last night .
