    "content_original": "Q. Who is arguing?\n\nA. Charles J. Cooper, a lawyer for the proponents of Proposition 8, will have half an hour. He will probably get questions about his clients\u2019 standing and the reasons offered to support the ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Olson, representing the couples who are challenging the ban, has 20 minutes. He will most likely be asked why the issue should be withdrawn from public debate and a fast-moving political process. Mr. Verrilli will have 10 minutes, and he will probably be asked about shifts in the Obama administration\u2019s positions.\n\nQ. What legal standard will the Supreme Court use?\n\nA. In ordinary cases, courts considering whether a federal law violates equal protection principles merely ask whether the law can be justified by a rational reason. That is a low bar, though several courts have struck down laws discriminating against gay men and lesbians under that standard. Gay rights advocates are hoping that the Supreme Court will embrace a more robust standard of review, \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d which requires a showing that the challenged law is \u201csubstantially related to an important government objective.\u201d Victory on that point could put all same-sex marriage bans at risk.\n\nQ. What justifications have supporters of Proposition 8 offered?\n\nA. They say that preserving the traditional definition of marriage will \u201cfurther society\u2019s vital interests in responsible procreation and child rearing.\u201d Those interests would be undermined, they say, by \u201cofficially redefining marriage as a genderless institution.\u201d It is rational, they add, to proceed with caution in changing the definition of marriage, to respect societal judgments made through the democratic process.\n\nQ. How do supporters of same-sex marriage respond?\n\nA. They say that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry would not make it any more likely that straight couples would act irresponsibly. They add that courts must protect the fundamental rights of disfavored minorities.\n\nQ. Who are the justices to watch?\n\nA. Justice Kennedy probably holds the decisive vote, and he is the author of the two leading gay rights cases. But he is hard to read. Chief Justice Roberts may be intrigued by the standing question, and his questions on that issue may suggest whether he might find dismissal on that ground an attractive offramp.\n\nQ. What are the possible outcomes?\n\nA. The court may say the Constitution requires all states to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. At the other extreme, the court may say the Constitution is silent on the question, leaving states free to allow or reject same-sex marriage. (There is no possibility that the court would ban same-sex marriage in places that choose to permit it.)\n\nThe court could also adopt a rationale that would apply only to California along the lines of the one endorsed by the Ninth Circuit. It could adopt the \u201ceight-state solution\u201d suggested by the Obama administration. Or it could dismiss the case for want of standing, which would probably effectively allow same-sex marriages in California.",
