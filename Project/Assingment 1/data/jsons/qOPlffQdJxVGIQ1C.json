    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The House on Friday approved legislation providing $ 15.25 billion for victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and pushing two fiscal deadlines into December , capping a dizzying week of deal-cutting and rapid-fire voting on Capitol Hill .\nThe bill , which will extend the government \u2019 s funding and suspend its debt limit until Dec. 8 , passed the House in a 316-90 vote with scant debate . It passed the Senate on Thursday . President Donald Trump signed the measure into law on Friday .\nThe bill \u2019 s passage marked a rare instance of Congress taking action to keep the government funded and increase its borrowing limit well before the month-end deadline for both issues . But the speed with which it traveled through both chambers belied the angst it generated among Republicans this week when Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democratic leaders .\n\u201c This Administration will always put the needs of the American people above partisan politics as usual , \u201d the White House said in a statement , accompanied by a photograph of Mr. Trump signing the bill at Camp David .\nHouse Republicans were unhappy about raising the debt ceiling without reining in federal spending , a longstanding GOP goal , and they tangled with top administration officials Friday morning shortly before the bill cleared their chamber .\nAfter years of blaming former President Barack Obama for the growing national debt , some Republicans said they were responsible for any abdication of fiscal discipline now that the GOP controls the White House and both chambers of Congress .\n\u201c We Republicans said \u2018 When we \u2019 re in charge we \u2019 re going to find a way to help the American people , but also be fiscally responsible , \u2019 \u201d said Rep. Mark Walker ( R. , N.C. ) , chairman of the Republican Study Committee , a group of more than 150 House Republicans .\nConservative groups that had urged Republicans to attach spending curbs to the debt limit criticized the legislation .\n\u201c It would be a stretch for voters to think right now that the Republican Party is the party of fiscal discipline , \u201d said Dan Holler , spokesman for Heritage Action for America .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) relied on the votes of House Democrats to clear the bill , as 90 Republicans balked at voting for it . Some Republicans supported it reluctantly , making clear that only the destruction wrought by the hurricanes convinced them to vote yes .\n\u201c I hate it , \u201d Rep. Roger Williams ( R. , Texas ) said of voting to raise the debt limit . \u201c I \u2019 m going to vote for my Texans . \u201d\nFrustration over the deal Mr. Trump struck with Democratic leaders bubbled over Friday morning when House Republicans met behind closed doors with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney , who had often argued against debt-limit increases with no strings attached when he formerly served in the House .\nThe two White House officials urged lawmakers to vote for the bill to ensure federal agencies would have sufficient funds amid the natural disasters .
