Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left . ''\nA sustained chant of `` build that wall '' broke out . `` We do n't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina , '' Trump responded . `` Our Republican candidate , Dan Bishop , will fight with everything he has . ''\nAs Bishop took the podium to speak briefly during the rally , an attendee required medical attention , leading Trump to step in and halt the event for several minutes . `` Doing better ? '' Trump asked . `` Good . I guess Dan 's speech was n't so good . Thank you , doctor . Thank you , law enforcement . ''\nBishop then urged attendees to pray for the individual , `` because that 's what we do . We pray . ''\nTrump separately criticized Democratic presidential candidates for saying at a recent primary debate that they would give away taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants . The Democratic field is so radical , Trump suggested , that Americans essentially have `` no choice '' but to vote to re-elect him .\nThe president also addressed the nation 's progress in reducing opioid deaths , as well as his positive economic numbers , noting that `` more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps '' and `` nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone . ''\n`` The unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand-new all-time low in the history of our country , '' Trump said to applause . `` And by the way , African American-youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history . ''\nAfter chants of `` four more years ! '' died down , Trump added : `` The labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years , and soon will be 35 years , and soon , I promise , will probably end up being better than ever . ''\nTrump also touted the nearly 200 federal judges he has successfully appointed -- including Associate Justice on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh , whom Trump said was `` put through hell .
