Kavanaugh is bad luck for the Washington Nationals , that he seemed nervous before his first date with the woman who would become his wife , and that he has never been treated for a gambling addiction \u2014 in case anyone had been curious .\nAmong the more than 1,200 written questions Democrats submitted to President Trump \u2019 s Supreme Court nominee were queries about his poker-playing habits , his affinity for attending baseball games , and his less-than-flush personal finances , all tucked inside more traditional questions about judicial precedent and his own lengthy record .\nIn written responses , Judge Kavanaugh brushed aside many of the legal inquiries , refused to criticize Mr. Trump and declined to say when he would recuse himself from cases \u2014 just as he did in his in-person testimony the week before .\nWhat he did do though , and in some detail , was answer questions about his personal finances and the house in Chevy Chase , Maryland , that seems to be eating up a lot of his money .\nHe went line-by-line through his home repairs , describing his money pit house that \u2019 s forced him to replace the air conditioning and water heater , buy a new oven and refrigerator , stop basement flooding , repaint inside and out , repair fences and remove mold .\nHe also revealed he bought season tickets to the D.C. \u2019 s baseball team from 2005 to 2017 \u2014 including tickets for every postseason home game during that time . And he revealed he \u2019 s bad luck : \u201c We are 3-8 in those games . \u201d\n\u201c My wife and I spend money on our daughters and sports , \u201d he said , adding in Nixonian Checkers-speech fashion that they recently joined the tony Chevy Chase Country Club \u201c primarily because of the ice hockey program that my younger daughter participates in . \u201d\nThe questions \u2014 and the personal details they elicited \u2014 were another sign of just how different this particular confirmation has been .\nSenators posed a total of 1,287 written questions , and all but nine of them were from Democrats .\nThomas Jipping , a former GOP staffer who \u2019 s now at the Heritage Foundation , and who \u2019 s been involved in 11 confirmations , said Democrats were essentially attempting to have a second hearing for the judge .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not only the sheer number of questions but it \u2019 s the focus on what the senators know Kavanaugh can not answer or provide , and that no nominee can answer or provide , \u201d Mr. Jipping said . \u201c They know that , and they \u2019 re intentionally asking dozens or hundreds of questions that no nominee can answer . There \u2019 s no way to describe that other than recklessly irresponsible . \u201d\nIn most of those cases Judge Kavanaugh replied with some version of claiming it would be \u201c improper \u201d to offer thoughts on a case that might come before him , either as a justice or even in his current job on the circuit court in Washington , D.C .\nIn one more substantive exchange with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , Rhode Island Democrat , Judge Kavanaugh said he will not release reporters from their confidentiality agreements with him during his time serving on the independent counsel \u2019 s investigation into the Clintons .\nDuring the hearing last week he admitted to having served as an anonymous source for reporters , at the direction of Independent Counsel Ken Starr . Prodded by senators , he said he would have to think about whether he would release those reporters from their obligation to protect him as a confidential source .\nBut in his written answers this week he said he would not release them \u2014 and said it was for reporters \u2019 own good .\n\u201c It would be inappropriate in this context to disregard that foundational privilege and protection for the press , \u201d he wrote .\nThe 1,287 written questions asked of Judge Kavanaugh are more than all previous high court nominees combined , according to Republicans . They come on top of four days of hearings last week that saw the judge sit for two full days of in-person questions .\nCarolyn Shapiro , co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court at the Chicago-Kent College of Law , said Judge Kavanaugh was more open about judicial philosophy questions than some past nominees \u2014 but still avoided issues he should have been willing to talk about .\nShe said one of those was his past comments on abortion \u2014 and particularly praise for then-Justice William Rehnquist \u2019 s dissent in the landmark Roe v. Wade case that made abortion a constitutional right . She said she was troubled that he wouldn \u2019 t defend or explain those sentiments .\nShe also said she thought the judge mischaracterized his own dissent in a controversial case involving an illegal immigrant teen seeking an abortion while in government care .\n\u201c What he said about his opinion in that case , I don \u2019 t think was entirely accurate , \u201d she said .\nShe said nominees shouldn \u2019 t be required to give assurances about future rulings . But he appeared to be stretching the limits of what \u2019 s become known as the \u201c Ginsburg standard \u201d of refusing to discuss cases in any detail at all .\nJudge Kavanaugh repeatedly declined to comment on major legal battles , citing former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others who he said had similarly demurred . More than 70 times in his written answers this week he cited \u201c nominee precedent \u201d for declining to answer .\nMs. Shapiro said looking back at Justice Ginsburg \u2019 s hearing , she was far more willing to talk about her past writings than Judge Kavanaugh was about his .\n\u201c As a general matter , I think that nominees should speak candidly about things , \u201d she said .\nMs. Shapiro did say the questions from senators about Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s financial history didn \u2019 t cross any lines .\nThose questions came chiefly from Mr. Whitehouse , who prodded the judge about debts shown on previous financial disclosures .\n\u201c Have you ever gambled or accrued gambling debt in the state of New Jersey ? \u201d asked Mr. Whitehouse .\nThe judge said he \u201c occasionally \u201d visited casinos there in college or in his 20s , and said he \u201c played low-stakes blackjack \u201d \u2014 and never ran up any debt .\nMr. Whitehouse continued : \u201c Have you ever sought treatment for a gambling addiction ? \u201d\nMr. Whitehouse concluded his line of questioning by wondering what Judge Kavanaugh had meant in an email to colleagues when he urged them to \u201c be very , very vigilant \u201d in a confidential matter he \u2019 d discussed with them .\nIt turns out that matter was his first date with his now-wife , Ashley , on Sept. 10 , 2001 .\n\u201c Over the course of the preceding weekend , I had discussed Ashley at some length with my longtime friends . In the email , I was asking my friends not to share my interest in and upcoming date with Ashley with their spouses , \u201d he said .\nMr. Whitehouse \u2019 s office didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment .\nThe tone of questions drew the attention of current Supreme Court justices .\nJustice Clarence Thomas , speaking at a Federalist Society event this week , mocked Democratic Sen.
