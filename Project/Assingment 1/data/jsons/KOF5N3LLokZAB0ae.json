Let me be clear : An agreement imposed by the UN would be a total and complete disaster . The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto . Why ? Because that 's not how you make a deal . Deals are made when parties come to the table and negotiate . Each side must give up something it values in exchange for something it requires . A deal that imposes conditions on Israel and the Palestinian Authority will do nothing to bring peace .

Just last week , American Taylor Allen Force , a West Point grad who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian . You do n't reward that behavior , you confront it ! It 's not up the United Nations to impose a solution . The parties must negotiate a resolution themselves . The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations , but no one should be telling Israel it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that do n't even really know what 's happening .\nTrump added that there is no moral equivalency between Israel and Palestine because the former doesn \u2019 t name public squares after terrorists ; they don \u2019 t pay children to stab innocent people .
