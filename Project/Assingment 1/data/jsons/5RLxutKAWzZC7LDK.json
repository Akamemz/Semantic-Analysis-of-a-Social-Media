There can be no doubt : it would have destroyed Clinton as a candidate , and it would have been seized on as ( further ) grounds for his impeachment as president .\nSign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\nYet late on Tuesday , the lawyer for Michael Cohen \u2013 Donald Trump \u2019 s personal attorney , fixer and keeper of his secrets \u2013 released a tape in which he and Trump are heard discussing how exactly to fund the silencing of a former Playboy model , Karen McDougal . Cohen apparently wanted it be handled legally , while Trump seemingly had other ideas .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll have to pay , \u201d Cohen says . Trump \u2019 s reply : \u201c Pay with cash . \u201d\nPut aside the impact an equivalent revelation about Clinton would have made in 1992 . Just imagine the storm this would have caused if it had come out at the time Cohen and Trump had that conversation , just two months before the 2016 election . The entire political class would have assumed it would be devastating .\nAnd yet few would now bet on the Cohen tape story destroying Trump . Instead , they \u2019 ll guess it will dominate the news cycle for a few hours , and be ignored by Fox News before being replaced by something else . For this has become the established pattern .\nNote this month \u2019 s revelations by BBC \u2019 s Panorama programme that Trump behaved like a \u201c predator \u201d at parties packed with teenage girls in the 1980s and 1990s . It included the testimony of Barbara Pilling , then a young model , who recalled Trump asking her age . On hearing that she was 17 , Trump said : \u201c Oh , great . So you \u2019 re not too old and not too young . That \u2019 s just great. \u201d Pilling added that she \u201c felt I was in the presence of a shark \u201d . Again , imagine what similar revelations would have done to the standing of Clinton or any previous president . Yet for Trump , they made barely a dent .\nThe simple , stubborn fact is that nothing seems to move Trump \u2019 s core supporters away from him . His approval rating among Republicans remains sky high ( though there are signs that the pool of Americans who identify as Republicans is shrinking , perhaps suggesting that it \u2019 s increasingly only Trump true believers who are proud to wear that party label ) . Trump \u2019 s 2016 observation that he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue and still not lose votes remains as valid as ever .\nIt \u2019 s one reason why Trump \u2019 s opponents ought not to invest too much hope in the special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign . Even if Mueller produces jaw-dropping evidence against Trump , the president \u2019 s base is unlikely to be impressed . For a flavour of the likely response , note Alex Jones \u2019 s latest Infowars broadcast , making the wild , evidence-free allegation that Mueller was involved in a child sex ring and fantasising about shooting Mueller . ( Predictably , Facebook , which carries Infowars , said the broadcast did not breach its rules . )\nWe have to face the grim reality that in our post-2016 world few of the previous norms and standards apply . In Britain , too , we can see how things have changed . There was a time when a government admission that it was having to plan for the possibility that food and medicine would run out \u2013 not through natural disaster , but because of a policy it was pursuing \u2013 would have been terminal . Now it \u2019 s just another day in Brexit .\nThe problem seems to be that a chunk of the electorate \u2013 whether diehard Trump supporters or hardcore Brexiters \u2013 is impervious to any countervailing evidence . By that same logic , hope surely must rest with those voters who are in the great middle : quieter than the rest , perhaps , but open to persuasion and willing to be moved by demonstrable facts . Those people surely still exist .\nIf there were to be a second referendum on Brexit , their votes would be crucial . In the US , they will have a decisive opportunity to make their voice heard in November \u2019 s midterm elections . At that moment , they will have much more than a chance to punish Trump .
