But an analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that Lee \u2019 s idea would add $ 2.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years .\nThe reform conservatives note that the ideas are mere blueprints for now . The main point , they say , is to show how conservative proposals can be turned into policies to help the middle class , not just recycled into the usual talking points about cutting taxes and slashing spending .\n\u201c Middle class families aren \u2019 t worried about their tax burden , \u201d said Reihan Salam , a policy adviser at the YG Network and contributing editor at National Review . \u201c They \u2019 re worried about how much it costs to own and operate a car .
