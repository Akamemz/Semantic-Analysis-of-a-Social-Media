Here\u2019s why.\n\nWhat is the 25th Amendment?\n\nTo understand why the amendment is not going to be used to remove Mr. Trump from office, it helps to know what spurred its creation: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe people in Congress, people who were shaken by this terrible event, wondered what would have happened if, having sustained a terrible head injury, he had nevertheless survived,\u201d says Philip Bobbitt, director of the Center for National Security Law at Columbia Law School and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cThat happened to James Garfield.\u201d\n\nThe amendment, ratified in 1967, is made up of four sections. The first basically restates the Constitution; the vice president will become president if the president resigns or dies. The next section empowers the president to nominate a new vice president should the office become vacant.\n\nSection 3 allows the president to deem himself temporarily incapacitated, voluntarily transfer his powers to the vice president, and reassume them at will. And it is Section 4 that enables a president\u2019s involuntary removal if he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of the office.\u201d\n\nHow would removal of a president work?\n\nIt would have to begin with some of the president\u2019s closest advisers: the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet, or of some other advisory committee Congress has designated by law. They would have to alert the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader that they deem the president \u201cunable.\u201d When they deliver this declaration, the vice president immediately becomes acting president.\n\nThat is, unless the president writes to the speaker and Senate leader that he is fine, which would then reinstate his powers. To settle this executive tussle, Congress is required to convene within 48 hours and vote within 21 days to determine whether the president may stay in office. A vote of removal requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate.\n\nIn contrast, impeachment only requires a simple majority in the House before a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove.\n\n\u201cHowever difficult it is to impeach someone, this is even more difficult,\u201d says Saikrishna Prakash, professor of law and Miller Center fellow at the University of Virginia.\n\nHow are these rules interpreted?\n\nThe least defined element of the amendment is the phrase \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties.\u201d\n\nFrom a position that considers the authors\u2019 original intent, the phrase implies some severe disability such as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s incapacitating stroke. But a literal reading of the text could have broader meaning: \u201cThe language is open-ended, but the language can quite fairly be read to encompass someone who is unfit physically, or unfit morally or psychologically, to discharge the office,\u201d says Professor Bobbitt.\n\nBut he also says just because you can take a broader interpretation, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best path. \u201cI think the fact that the historical background of the amendment does not contemplate matters of character ... makes it not the right vehicle,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something as divisive in the country as reversing an election, then you want to have all the constitutional arrows going the same direction.\u201d\n\nWhatever the interpretation, it only matters if Cabinet members decide to publicly question the president\u2019s ability.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the question of what all this means, and there\u2019s the question of how likely this is to be invoked by the president\u2019s allies,\u201d Professor Prakash says. \u201cI think it\u2019s silly to think that any of the people in the Cabinet or the vice president are going to pull the trigger on this.\u201d",
