    "content": "In his first six years in office , President Barack Obama hired three centrist defense secretaries whose credibility with the military and Congress shielded Obama from some of the blowback that struck the previous Democratic president , Bill Clinton .\nBut during that time , the White House took on a progressively greater role in setting defense policy , with two of Obama \u2019 s defense chiefs , Bob Gates and Leon Panetta , blaming Obama \u2019 s team for policy failures and interference . The third defense boss , Chuck Hagel , proved so unable to navigate the White House currents that he was let go without an obvious replacement .\nNow , as Obama prepares to introduce his fourth defense chief , the Democratic thinker and policy-maker Ash Carter , the president \u2019 s own credibility on national security \u2014 and his relationship with the military \u2014 is on the line as never before .\nYet almost no one expects the White House to show any greater deference to the Pentagon than under Gates , Panetta or Hagel .\nThe White House isn \u2019 t looking for someone to send them strategy papers but to carry out the strategy the West Wing and National Security Council set and Carter \u2019 s well suited to that , former senior foreign policy officials say .\nCarter \u2019 s strengths are that he knows the building \u2014 there won \u2019 t be a long \u201c get to know you \u201d period where he figures out how to navigate the Pentagon and develop relationships with the military .
