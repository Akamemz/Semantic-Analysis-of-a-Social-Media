House leaders sell immigration plan\nCAMBRIDGE , Md . \u2014 The House Republican leadership is trying to sell their colleagues on a series of broad immigration principles , including a path to legal status for those here illegally .\nSpeaker John Boehner \u2019 s leadership team introduced the principles at their annual policy retreat here . Top Republicans circulated a tightly held one-page memo titled \u201c standards for immigration reform \u201d toward the tail-end of a day that include strategy conversations about Obamacare , the economy and the national debt .\nIn the private meeting where the language was introduced , Boehner ( R-Ohio ) told Republicans that the standards are \u201c as far as we are willing to go . \u201d\n\u201c Nancy Pelosi said yesterday that for her caucus , it is a special path to citizenship or nothing , \u201d Boehner said , according to a source in the room . \u201c If Democrats insist on that , then we are not going to get anywhere this year . \u201d\nBoehner said the standards represent \u201c a fair , principled way for us to solve this issue . \u201d\nThe strategy marks a shift for House Republicans . In 2013 , Boehner \u2019 s chamber ignored the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by the Senate . But toward the end of last year and early this year , Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R-Va. ) , Whip Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) and Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) began hashing out this approach to rally Republicans toward reform .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to act on immigration reform because we \u2019 re focused on jobs and economic growth , and this is about jobs and growth , \u201d Boehner said in his pitch in the closed meeting . \u201c Reform is also about our national security . The safety and security of our nation depends on our ability to secure our border , enforce our laws , improve channels for legal entry to the country , and identify who is here illegally . \u201d\nEmbracing legalization is a modest change for Republican leaders \u2014 some of them signaled openness to the idea last year . For a Republican Party that advocated \u201c self-deportation \u201d as recently as 2012 , it \u2019 s a massive shift .\nSome Republicans fear of the political fallout from immigration reform , but the proposal suggests GOP leaders are taking the long view : Republicans need to woo the booming Hispanic population to stay relevant .\nAt the private meeting where the proposal was unveiled , lawmakers talked about their distrust that President Barack Obama will enforce the law , according to sources inside of the room . Ryan and Boehner spoke in favor of the effort , but high-profile conservatives like Rep. Tom Price ( R-Ga. ) and Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) were more suspect of the reform push .\n\u201c Nobody , even those who want to get this done , trusts the president , \u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R-Fla. ) said in a phone interview Thursday evening . \u201c And I understand it , because I don \u2019 t either . \u201d\nBut legislation on some of the key components of the principles , most notably the legalization part , have not been released and it remains to be seen how the full set of principles are received by rank-and-file House Republicans \u2014 many who have been skeptical of acting on immigration reform this year .\nThe principles stress that undocumented immigrants will have to go through the current immigration system and complete several prerequisites . Criminals will not be eligible for legalization .\n\u201c These persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S. , but only if they were willing to admit their culpability , pass rigorous background checks , pay significant fines and back taxes , develop proficiency in English and American civics , and be able to support themselves and their families ( without access to public benefits ) , \u201d according to a draft of the document .\nA broad swath of pro-reform groups \u2014 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the liberal-leaning America \u2019 s Voice \u2014 welcomed the principles . But one concern already being raised by Democrats and immigration reform advocates off Capitol Hill is language in the principles that call for \u201c specific enforcement triggers \u201d to be in place before undocumented immigrants can get on the legalization track .\nThat section is meant to make sure that the Obama administration \u2014 and future presidents \u2014 enforce any immigration laws that Congress may pass . One of the most prominent immigration actions from Obama has been halting the deportations of young undocumented immigrants who qualify , known as Dreamers \u2014 a move that was done without the blessing of Congress .\nBut Democrats and advocates worry those \u201c triggers \u201d will be overly restrictive \u2014 preventing millions of undocumented immigrants from beginning the process to become legalized .\n\u201c It leaves them vulnerable to deportation for God knows how long , \u201d Kevin Appleby , the director of migration policy for the pro-reform U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , said in an e-mail .\nAna Avenda\u00f1o , the director of immigration and community action for the AFL-CIO , also called the trigger issue a \u201c serious concern \u201d for the labor group . In a statement , the AFL-CIO called the principles \u201c flimsy . \u201d\nThe leadership \u2019 s principles do treat young undocumented immigrants differently , however . House Republican leaders declared that lawmakers should give a pathway to legal residence and citizenship for young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children .\n\u201c For those who meet certain eligiblity standards , and serve honorably in our military or attain a college degree , we will do just that , \u201d the document says .\nThe blueprint is also silent on whether the broader undocumented population will ever be able to apply for permanent residency \u2014 and eventually , citizenship \u2014 by using pathways that currently exist for all immigrants . The principles rule out a so-called \u201c special \u201d pathway to citizenship \u2014 meaning a separate track for undocumented immigrants that isn \u2019 t available to other immigrants .\nThe document \u2014 drafted by leadership with input from key GOP lawmakers who have been working on immigration \u2014 also makes clear that the House will not negotiate with the Senate on its comprehensive bill . In fact , GOP leadership has already begun laying out the differences between the House \u2019 s approach and the Senate \u2019 s bill .\n\u201c The problems in our immigration system must be solved through a step-by-step , common-sense approach that starts with securing our country \u2019 s borders , enforcing our laws , and implementing robust enforcement measures , \u201d the document \u2019 s preamble reads .\nThe pathway outlined in the principles does not open up until the nation \u2019 s borders are secure .
