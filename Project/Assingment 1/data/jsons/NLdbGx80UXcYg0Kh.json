    "content": "Now that Donald Trump has officially tapped Indiana Gov . Mike Pence to join his ticket , Hillary Clinton should select Tim Kaine to be her running mate .\nThat \u2019 s according to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus \u2014 a panel of battleground-state activists , operatives and strategists . Pluralities in both parties picked Kaine , the Virginia senator whom many dubbed the \u201c safe \u201d choice among a list of seven supposed Clinton short-listers as the best choice for the presumptive Democratic nominee .\nGiven the choices of Kaine and six other reported contenders , 38 percent of Democratic insiders and 42 percent of GOP insiders said Kaine would make the best running mate for Clinton , who reportedly spent Friday at her home in Washington considering her options and meeting with a number of hopefuls , including Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jul\u00edan Castro and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren . But few Democrats thought Castro or Warren \u2014 12 percent , respectively \u2014 would be the best choice for Clinton .\nGOP insiders , meanwhile , mostly praised Trump \u2019 s selection of Pence . A 54-percent majority of Republicans said Pence was a good choice that would help the Trump campaign , while 7 percent said he was a poor choice that would harm the campaign . Thirty-nine percent said the choice of Pence won \u2019 t have any impact on Trump \u2019 s campaign at all .\nAmong Democrats who looked forward to Clinton \u2019 s pick , those who selected Kaine cited his experience as a governor , senator and chair of the Democratic National Committee . One New Hampshire Democrat \u2014 who , like all respondents , completed the survey anonymously \u2014 said Kaine \u201c reinforces [ Clinton \u2019 s ] theme of competence running against an unprepared reckless opponent . \u201d\n\u201c Hillary comes to this from a position of strength , \u201d added a Florida Democrat . \u201c She does n't need someone to expand her coalition . This election does n't need more spice \u2014 The Donald is more than enough . So she should stick with steady , proven leadership \u2014 which is a big part of her brand . \u201d\nAdded a Pennsylvania Democrat : \u201c I still think that Clinton should stay safe and go with Kaine . He matches up with Pence in terms of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , but has been able to steer a moderate course without getting into the cultural jams of Pence . And the Pence/Kaine exchange on Medicaid expansion and Obamacare will be priceless . \u201d\n\u201c Like Trump , she needs someone low key , \u201d added an Iowa Democrat . `` In her case , however , it 's because she just is n't very exciting or a good campaigner and would n't want a VP choice to steal the spotlight . Kaine fills that bill . That he 's fluent in Spanish will help with Hispanics . \u201d\n\u201c Hillary needs a safe pick , \u201d said a Colorado Republican . \u201c She needs someone that independents and disgruntled Republicans can support . \u201d\n\u201c Kaine is a safe pick for Clinton and stacks up against Pence , essentially negating what each might bring to the ticket , \u201d added a Wisconsin Republican .\nSupport for other candidates was limited . Like Castro and Warren , 12 percent of Democratic insiders said Clinton should pick Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , a former governor of swing-state Iowa .\n\u201c Hillary should focus on a young , capable person of color , \u201d said a Florida Democrat . \u201c Respect for all people is important , and diversity matters . \u201d\nInsiders who chose Warren said the first-term senator could help Clinton with voters who sided with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries .\n\u201c Hillary needs to shore up her image as willing to attack the establishment , and Elizabeth Warren brings energy to the campaign at a time when Hillary really needs it , \u201d said a North Carolina Democrat . \u201c The fact that Hillary is now even with Trump in the [ CBS News/New York Times ] poll is actually a good wake-up call for Democrats , who will need to fight with all they have to defeat Trump . Elizabeth Warren is a fighter . She 's a fighter that ordinary people can relate to . \u201d\nMost of the support for Vilsack came from his home state . \u201c Tom Vilsack is a steady leader who has deep experience and a real sense of loyalty to Hillary , \u201d one Iowa Democrat said . \u201c He has an American story of tragedy and triumph . He 's also one of the most genuine and caring people in politics today . \u201d\nAn Iowa Republican said Vilsack would be a good analog for Pence : \u201c Wonky white Midwestern governor meets the same , \u201d the Republican said . \u201c Tom Vilsack has been a loyal soldier for Hillary Clinton since ending his own [ presidential ] bid nearly 10 years ago . Iowa is the closest of the toss-ups right now , and choosing a beloved native son would be a significant blow to Trump 's efforts here . \u201d\nColorado Gov . John Hickenlooper , who reportedly met with Clinton Friday at her home , wasn \u2019 t on the list of seven potential running mates offered as options for Caucus insiders ; the survey was conducted prior to news of Hickenlooper \u2019 s meeting being reported . But of the 7 percent of Democratic insiders who chose \u201c other , \u201d none mentioned Hickenlooper .\nRepublicans , meanwhile , said Trump \u2019 s choice of Pence would help the thrice-married New York billionaire bring aboard social conservatives . One Colorado Republican called Pence an \u201c excellent choice \u201d that \u201c helps address many of the concerns and perceived weaknesses of the presumptive nominee . \u201d\n\u201c Pence brings a solid track record , collaborative ties to GOP leaders in Congress , and a disciplined , cautious demeanor to the ticket , \u201d the Republican said . \u201c His strong ties with social conservatives and major conservative donors will help reassure both concerned members of the Republican establishment as well as a skittish evangelical base that is n't yet convinced that Trump will be an advocate for the issues important to social conservatives and others on the right . \u201d\n\u201c Pence is as restrained , conventional , and palatable as his haircut , \u201d added an Ohio Republican , who called the Indiana governor a \u201c good counterweight to Trump 's undisciplined , unpredictable , and odd political coiffure . \u201d\nAn Ohio Republican called Pence \u201c a slight positive \u201d who would \u201c give some comfort to social conservatives. \u201d And he added that Pence faced a tight reelection campaign back in Indiana \u2014 which he officially abandoned just minutes after Trump \u2019 s announcement \u2014 and Republicans could be better-positioned with a different candidate .\n\u201c Truthfully , this gets Pence out of a losing situation , so the [ Republican Governors Association ] is the biggest beneficiary , \u201d the insider said .\nAmong those who predicted Pence wouldn \u2019 t make an impact was the usual cadre of Republicans who said little could change the culture of the Trump campaign .\n\u201c This is the Donald Trump freak show , \u201d one Ohio Republican said . \u201c [ Neither ] Pence nor anyone else would have mattered . \u201d\n\u201c Pence is no-harm , no-foul , \u201d added a Florida Republican . \u201c He wo n't mean a lot because there 's only one chief clown in the Trump circus , and that 's Trump . \u201d\nWhile few GOP insiders said Trump erred in choosing Pence , one who did was hoping for more sizzle from the former casino owner and reality-television star .\nThese are the members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus , not all of whom participated in this special survey :\nColorado : Ryan Call , Laura Carno , Matt Chandler , Will Coyne , Adam Eichberg , Mark Ferrandino , Cole Finegan , Michael Fortney , Andrew Freedman , Ted Harvey , Craig Hughes , Owen Loftus , Pete Maysmith , Frank McNulty , Karen Middleton , Christopher Murray , BJ Nikkel , Josh Penry , Rick Ridder , Alan Salazar , Janice Sinden , Pat Steadman , Pat Waak , Steve Welchert , Taylor West , Roxane White , Rob Witwer\nFlorida : Fernand Amandi , Scott Arceneaux , JP Austin , Tim Baker , Dennis K.
