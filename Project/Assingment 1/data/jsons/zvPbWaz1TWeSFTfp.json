Researchers discovered that low-level electric fields can render the coronavirus unable to infect a host after just a minute of exposure to the field.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about this product.\n\nMore:How to clean, reuse or hack a coronavirus mask\n\nBased on an FDA-approved concept\n\nThough the application to the novel coronavirus is new, the technology isn\u2019t.\n\nThe concept \u2014 called electroceutical fabric \u2014 was developed several years ago by Chandan Sen, now the director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering at the Indiana University School of Medicine. While working at Ohio State University in 2017, he created an electrically based antimicrobial wound dressing that has been approved by the FDA and sold by Vomaris under the name Procella.\n\nSen detailed the potential application to COVID-19 on May 14 in a preliminary study released online at the preprint server ChemRxiv.
