    "content": "The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov . John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summer 's convention .\nIn a pair of simultaneously released statements , the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz `` a clear path '' ahead of that state 's winner-take-all primary May 3 , while the Cruz campaign will `` clear the path '' for Kasich in Oregon , which votes May 17 , and New Mexico , which votes June 7 .\n`` Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans , '' Cruz 's campaign manager , Jeff Roe , said . `` To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November , our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov . Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico , and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead . ''\nThe arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz 's team , which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated anti-Trump effort as recently as late last week . Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman 's Republican foes : Time is running out to stop him .\nA statement from the Trump campaign called the move `` a horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have horribly failed . ''\nThe Kasich campaign confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it had canceled two Indiana campaign events scheduled for Tuesday . As recently as three days ago Kasich 's campaign announced investments in Indiana , including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team .\nCampaign manager John Weaver said in his statement that the Kasich team hoped to perform well in Oregon and New Mexico , which Weaver said were `` structurally similar '' to northeastern states where Kasich performed well earlier in the cycle .\n`` Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland , '' Weaver added , `` where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee . ''\nThe announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire is poised to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead . Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland , which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island , Connecticut , Pennsylvania and Delaware .\nTrump needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination . If he falls short , the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested convention .\nAt a rally in Hagerstown , Md. , Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention .\n`` I only care about the first . We 're not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth , '' said Trump .\nEven before the plan was announced , Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana , which holds its primary on May 3 . Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning point .\n`` Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland , '' Kasich 's campaign said Sunday . `` We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already , and given the current dynamics of the primary there , we will shift our campaign 's resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana .
