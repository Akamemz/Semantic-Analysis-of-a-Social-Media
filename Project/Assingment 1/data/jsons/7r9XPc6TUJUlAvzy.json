    "content": "The New York Times has decided to blame the El Paso murders not on the actual killer but on \u201c conservative media stars. \u201d As here .\nSpecifically , by name , that would be the Fox News evening lineup of Tucker Carlson , Sean Hannity , and Laura Ingraham . Then it goes on to talk radio \u2019 s Rush Limbaugh , plus Fox and Friends \u2019 Brian Kilmeade , Fox \u2019 s Jeanine Pirro , and Ann Coulter . Thrown in along the way were \u201c outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit , \u201d with a specific mention of Sinclair \u2019 s Boris Epshteyn . And oh yes , there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan .\nSuffice to say , the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself . Big time .\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month . In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan , the killer wrote that he was \u201c simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion . \u201d\nGot that ? There was a \u201c striking degree of overlap \u201d between the language of these conservative media stars and \u201c the language used by \u201d the El Paso killer in his so-called \u201c manifesto . \u201d\nWell , now . What did the Times story mysteriously leave out ? This .\nTo borrow from the Times , \u201c There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by \u201d the Texas shooter .\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders , both Democrat AND Republican , have been failing us for decades . They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history . The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations .\nWhere would the killer get such an idea ? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language ?\nHe could start by reading this November 25 , 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled :\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another , big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years , new data show .\nIn which the Times columnist says this ( bold print supplied ) :\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt , as well as the labor movement , Granger movement , Progressive movement and more . Of course , monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power , and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time . It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan . Over the past 40 years , it has happened again . The federal government , under presidents of both parties , has largely surrendered to monopoly power . \u201c The \u2018 anti \u2019 in \u2018 antitrust \u2019 has been discarded , \u201d as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book , \u201c The Curse of Bigness. \u201d Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes . The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT & T monopoly .\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist , Farhad Manjoo , assailing five specific corporations :\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations \u201c Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and Alphabet , the parent company of Google \u201d :\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism : We are , all of us , in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy .\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations : \u201c It \u2019 s too late to escape . \u201d\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations , this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon , identified as \u201c a professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley. \u201d The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of \u201c corporate inversions \u201d :\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions \u2014 deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills \u2014 wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes . It \u2019 s called earnings stripping , and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop . The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year . Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet , a $ 152 billion deal for Allergan , the maker of Botox , which is based in Dublin . The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington . At the same time , the companies stay in the United States , getting all the benefits of our country .\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations , their evasions of taxes , and more . Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter . But let \u2019 s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .\nWarren , it turns out , had a fan in the Dayton , Ohio , shooter . And Warren \u2019 s language on corporations and their power couldn \u2019 t be missed . Examples ?\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren \u2019 s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell , \u201c Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \u201d The headline :\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes \u201c that big corporations \u2019 political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals , and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power . \u201d\nReplying to Mitt Romney \u2019 s statement in 2008 that \u201c corporations are people , \u201d Warren said :\nNo , Governor Romney , corporations are not people . People have hearts , they have kids , they get jobs , they get sick , they love , and they die . And that matters . That matter because we don \u2019 t run this country for corporations , we run it for people . People feel the system is rigged against them . And here \u2019 s the painful part . They \u2019 re right . The system is rigged . Look around . Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies . Wall Street CEOs \u2014 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2014 still strut around Congress , no shame , demanding favors , and acting like we should thank them .\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power , but let \u2019 s move to Bernie Sanders . Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution :\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands . In 2015 , I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that . The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits . Instead , it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned . This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore , by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated . American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay , but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate .\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media :\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media . That \u2019 s a high level of concentration . Today , as a result of massive mergers and takeovers , six corporations control 90 percent of what we see , hear , and read . This is outrageous , and a real threat to our democracy .\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders \u2014 not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates .\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times , Warren , and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power .\nSurprise ? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker , Sean , Laura , Rush , and the rest , the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter \u2019 s \u201c manifesto \u201d and the Times itself , as well as Warren and Sanders . Say again : not \u2026 a \u2026 single \u2026 word .\nThe obvious conclusion ? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media .\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target : the New York Times itself .",

Says the killer:\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades.
