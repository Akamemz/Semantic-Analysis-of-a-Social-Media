But the subtext is clear : Trust us , you won \u2019 t contract coronavirus from eating our pizza .\nEverything has changed in the months since COVID-19 has reared its ugly head : 80,000 are dead , nearly 1.5 million are confirmed to be infected , and tens of millions are out of work . Schools , workplaces , and community groups have shifted online ; sports seasons , movie premieres , and vacation plans have been put on hold .\nBut even within our \u201c new normal \u201d of sheltering in place , social distancing , and mask-wearing , something else has been evolving : our relationships with one another .\nIt happened subtly at first . You might have begun opening doors with your shirt sleeve , or ceased shaking hands . You stopped frequenting your favorite coffee shop , or taking public transportation . Eventually , you caved and bought a mask . Trips to the grocery store have become fewer and farther between , and you find yourself recoiling if you turn the corner into a new aisle and see another shopper heading your way . When the elevator \u2019 s brakes kick into gear , you now cringe , knowing someone else is about to join you in your suddenly too-small metal box .\nNine weeks into the Age of COVID-19 , we \u2019 ve learned more about the virus , how it spreads , and what it does to our bodies . And we \u2019 ve evolved into amateur epidemiologists in the process . Date nights have become possible hotspots . Our parents and grandparents are now \u201c high-risk populations. \u201d Where we once saw friends and neighbors , we now see potential vectors .\n\u201c When we get Amazon packages in the mail , \u201d said D.J . Gallant , a loan underwriter who lives just outside of Minneapolis , \u201c I \u2019 ll bring the Amazon package in and take a set of wipes\u2014or a rag\u2014and spray it down with some disinfectant , disinfect the whole box , open the box , disinfect whatever \u2019 s inside . \u2026 You \u2019 re pretty sure everything \u2019 s okay , but you don \u2019 t want to take any chances . \u201d\nGallant \u2019 s 9-month-old daughter has a compromised immune system\u2014and his wife is a labor and delivery nurse at a local hospital\u2014so he \u2019 s taking extra precautions . But he \u2019 s far from alone . In a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , 73 percent of Americans reported being very or somewhat worried about the possibility that they or someone in their immediate family might catch COVID-19 . Forty-five percent said they were concerned about leaving their homes for groceries or other supplies . And 69 percent in a USA Today/Ipsos survey claimed they stopped attending social events because of the coronavirus outbreak .\nThe \u201c invisible enemy , \u201d as President Trump has grown fond of calling it , spreads primarily from person to person . The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) says it \u201c may be possible \u201d to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus on it , but concludes that the main driver of transmission is through \u201c respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or talks. \u201d Some studies are finding evidence\u2014inconclusive as of now\u2014that the coronavirus \u201c may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols . \u201d\nDr. Roderick Kramer , a social psychologist at Stanford University , published an article for Harvard Business Review back in 2002 introducing the concept of \u201c prudent paranoia , \u201d a heightened sense of vigilance that can prove beneficial\u2014rather than destructive\u2014for the person wielding it . The piece was written against the backdrop of the 9/11 attacks\u2014and focuses primarily on competition in the workplace\u2014but Kramer believes the theory remains relevant in the current climate .\nThere \u2019 s \u201c just a really evident wariness and concern , \u201d he tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c In talking to my kids\u2014who are both 25 and 30 years old\u2014they \u2019 ve been worried about infecting their parents and other family members . So there is that kind of prudent wariness . \u201d\nKramer has spent decades studying trust , distrust , and paranoia . Elevated suspicion is common throughout history , but he says it typically exists within an \u201c in-group out-group context , \u201d where people make \u201c sinister \u201d or \u201c problematic \u201d assumptions about another person \u2019 s motives based on race or nationality . \u201c Decades of research on ethnocentrism and \u2026 intergroup hostility show how easily antipathy , fear , anxiety , and active distrust and suspicion ferment even under minimal informational conditions , \u201d he said . The FBI \u2019 s warning in late-March against a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans is just the most recent example of this phenomenon .\nBut the pandemic is doing something different : sowing doubt and uncertainty within existing social circles . \u201c I live on the Stanford campus in a faculty area , so it \u2019 s all faculty , \u201d Kramer explained . \u201c These are our friends . And walking down the street , people look at you , some people seem to be reluctant even to say hello , and they \u2019 re extremely uncomfortable looking . And you \u2019 ll see people turn around as you \u2019 re heading towards them , even though it 's a very wide street . I \u2019 ve really been shocked . It \u2019 s almost like a kind of McCarthy-type paranoia . \u201d\nFor the economy to \u201c reopen \u201d in any meaningful way , political and public health leaders will need to find ways to assuage this paranoia . If you don \u2019 t have enough faith in your neighbor to say hello , after all , you \u2019 re probably unlikely to get on an airplane , go to the gym , or order pizza that \u2019 s been touched by human hands .\nThe Trump administration seems to understand this , which is why the White House is reportedly looking to message this week that \u201c the American people can have confidence as they begin to go back out into the public square . \u201d\nThat could prove difficult . Only 23 percent of respondents in an Associated Press/NORC Center poll have \u201c quite a bit \u201d of trust in information about the coronavirus conveyed by President Trump . State and local governments and public health agencies like the CDC inspire much more confidence among the public , but their outlooks tend to be less rosy . ( The human mind \u2019 s \u201c negativity bias \u201d \u2014or tendency to weight bad news more heavily than good\u2014may provide additional credence to these public health officials in this instance precisely because their outlook tends to be less rosy . )\nInfectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci , for example , is set to testify on Tuesday before the Senate health committee , where he hopes to convey the \u201c danger of trying to open the country prematurely. \u201d In an email to the New York Times , Fauci said that ignoring the coronavirus task force \u2019 s \u201c Opening Up America Again \u201d guidelines risks \u201c multiple outbreaks throughout the country \u201d that will \u201c result in needless suffering and death \u201d and \u201c set us back on our quest to return to normal . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s the message that \u2019 s breaking through in most of the country , where a majority of Americans continue to support lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus . \u201c Even if Trump , or [ Minnesota Gov . Tim ] Walz , or [ Wisconsin Gov . Tony ] Evers came out and said , \u2018 Guess what , we \u2019 re going to open everything up , everything \u2019 s good to go tomorrow , \u2019 \u201d Gallant hypothesized , \u201c No . \u2026 Yeah , it sucks . It \u2019 s inconvenient . But I do not think I will go about my regular kind of day-to-day until probably next year . \u201d\nAs a millennial , Gallant \u2019 s risk of severe complications resulting from a coronavirus infection are relatively low . The confirmed case fatality rate for 30-39 year olds\u2014based on data from South Korea , Italy , China , and Spain\u2014is likely somewhere between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent .\nBut while statistics like those may be reassuring on a macro level , individual Americans don \u2019 t want to become statistics themselves . \u201c If my wife were to get infected or somebody were to get infected , \u201d Gallant said , trailing off . \u201c Most of the time ... it \u2019 s fine . But if you end up in that part that needs critical care \u2026 you can just straight-up die . \u201d\n\u201c We had a 5 percent chance of something happening to our daughter with a viral infection she had when she was born , and turns out we hit the odds on that , \u201d he added . \u201c I would rather just play it safe . \u201d",
