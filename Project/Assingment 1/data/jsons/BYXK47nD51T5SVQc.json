'' The tweet continues that `` no matter your views , if you suspect political bias has caused you to be censored or silenced online , we want to hear about it !

Yet too many Americans have seen their accounts suspended , banned , or fraudulently reported for unclear 'violations ' of user policies . ''\nEarlier this month , Trump sent out a series of tweets criticizing social media companies after Facebook banned several extremist figures , most of them prominent far right personalities such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones .

This is the United States of America \u2014 and we have what 's known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH ! ''\nThe questionnaire continues by asking people names , contact information , whether they are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and what happened to their social media accounts in question . It also asks if the respondent wants to sign up for the president 's email newsletters , `` so we can update you without relying on platforms like Facebook and Twitter . ''\nThe query does not say how the information will be used . To ensure that the respondent is `` not a robot , '' as online forms routinely do , it asks what year the Declaration of Independence was signed . As some techies quickly noted on Twitter , this sort of verification is very easy for bots to game , unlike , say , trying to pick out blurry images of traffic lights from a photo .\nThe form does not ask respondents their political affiliation . But it comes amid growing conservative criticism of tech platforms for their perceived political bias . While some tech company executives may lean liberal , they have long asserted that their products are without political bias . Twitter said Wednesday that it enforces its rules regardless of users ' background or political affiliation . Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment .\nThe tool was launched the same day the White House declined to sign a global pledge to step up efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate , organize extremist groups and broadcast attacks , citing respect for freedom of expression .",
