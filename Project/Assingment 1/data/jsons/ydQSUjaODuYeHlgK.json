The economy is strengthening as he starts to wind down America 's longest war , but his poll numbers are the lowest since he took office almost five years ago .\nUsually , a growing economy and bringing the troops home mean public love for the commander in chief , but not this time .\nThe flush of success from Obama 's re-election last year faded quickly as his administration faced a series of controversies -- some unavoidable and some self-inflicted -- that eroded Obama 's credibility along with the belief that he can bring about the kind of change he called for in running for president .\n`` People do n't think he 's as competent as they used to think , '' said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger . `` They do n't think he 's as trustworthy as they used to think . ''\nHere are six reasons for the President 's difficult year , starting with his greatest achievement toward the promised change of his first term that became perhaps his biggest liability : the health care reforms known as Obamacare .\nIf one day in 2013 exemplified Obama 's change in fortune from his first term , it was October 1 .\nJUST WATCHED Like your health plan ... keep it ? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Like your health plan ... keep it ? 02:09\nThat was the launch of the long-awaited HealthCare.gov website that would , in Obama 's words , make getting health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act as easy as shopping on Amazon.com .\nOn the same day , a highly unpopular government shutdown started because of Republican demands to dismantle Obamacare as part of a needed spending measure to keep federal agencies running .\nIt should have been a decisive double play for Democrats , with public anger at Republicans over the eventual 16-day shutdown rising as Americans finally got to experience the full benefits of the health care reforms they had been promised since the law was passed in 2010 .\nBut the website malfunctioned badly from the start , with repeated stalling and error messages that made successful navigation impossible for most users .\nOnce the shutdown ended on October 16 , media focus shifted to the full extent of the Obamacare website problems .\nThat gave Republicans fiercely opposed to the health care reforms a new opening to attack both the overall law and the big government approach of Democrats .\nOn top of all this came reports that insurers were sending cancellation notices to individual policy holders that undermined Obama 's repeated pledge of previous years that `` if you like your health care plan , you can keep it . ''\nWhile less than 5 % of the population , the individual health insurance market comprised several million people whose stories of canceled policies took over the media narrative . PolitiFact declared Obama 's false promise its `` lie of the year . ''\nNow Republicans trying to dismantle the reforms warn of more hidden impacts including higher premiums and canceled coverage in the first full year of Obamacare in 2014 .\n`` This really represents the single ... biggest instance of consumer fraud in the nation 's history , '' GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters this week . `` And the American people are increasingly led to the conclusion they can not trust this administration to say what it means or mean what it says . ''\nObama brought in outside tech experts to get the website working better , and enrollment figures increased in November and December . However , it remained unclear if the administration can regain control of the narrative .\nOn Friday , the website was down again for a few hours , but Obama boasted to reporters at his year-end news conference that more than 1 million people had enrolled so far .\nPolls show Obama 's support at the lowest levels of his presidency .\nJUST WATCHED Carney : Everyone has taken a hit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Carney : Everyone has taken a hit 02:10\nA new CNN/ORC International survey released Friday showed a drop of 14 percentage points since January in the President 's approval rating , down to 41 % .\nMeanwhile , an ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed 45 % of Americans trusted Republicans to do a better job handling the economy compared to 41 % for Obama .\nIt was a different story last December , when the President had a 54 % -36 % advantage on the same question just after his re-election .\n`` It 's crazy how this has switched , even given the fact that the Republicans blew the government shutdown like they did in October , '' Borger said .\nObama shrugged off the low poll numbers on Friday , telling reporters at his year-end news conference that `` if I was interested in polling , I would n't have run for president . ''\nInstead , he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress such as the growing Obamacare enrollment .\n`` That is a big deal . That 's why I ran for this office , '' Obama said .\nHis approval ratings started declining in most national surveys in June as he dealt with controversies such as IRS targeting of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status and classified leaks that revealed National Security Agency surveillance of phone records .\n`` Many people assume that Obama 's low approval ratings today are due to the flawed health care website that debuted in October , '' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said Thursday . `` But the biggest drop in Obama 's numbers came in the late spring and early summer . In mid-May , Obama 's approval rating was at 53 % ; by mid-June , after revelations about the IRS and the NSA , it had dropped to 45 % and stayed there for several months . ''\nHolland concluded : `` It 's been a bad year for Obama , but his troubles did n't start in October -- they date back to May and June . ''\nThe Patriot Act passed after the 9/11 attacks led to a huge NSA surveillance network that operated under review by secret courts , with little public knowledge .\nJUST WATCHED Obama wo n't scramble jets for Snowden Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama wo n't scramble jets for Snowden 01:00\nThen former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about it in June .\nSuddenly , a program Obama inherited became a major problem , as Snowden 's revelations showed the government routinely collected phone records -- but not the content of calls -- for possible use in tracking terrorism suspects .\nSuspicions that the government spied on its own people ensued , fueled by incomplete or misleading administration responses such as when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper denied to a congressional committee that such surveillance occurred .\nSnowden 's leaks also made public embarrassing revelations of U.S. spying on allies such as Brazil , France , Mexico and Germany .\nWhile Obama never personally bore the brunt of direct responsibility for the extent of the NSA surveillance , the Snowden leaks enhanced a public perception of an administration steeped in secret activities that it denied or tried to continue hiding .\nThe issue caused rifts in Obama 's Democratic base , with liberals opposed to the surveillance that the President defended as important for national security .\nHe also has angered the liberal wing by continuing the policy of his immediate predecessor , Republican President George W. Bush , to use drone strikes against terrorism targets abroad .\nAn inspector general 's report in May that showed the IRS targeted conservative groups in determining extra scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status was the scandal du jour in Washington before being relegated to back-burner status by the Snowden leaks .\nJUST WATCHED Rep.
