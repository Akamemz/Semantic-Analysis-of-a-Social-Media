It\u2019s an unusual group photo: they\u2019re not family, they\u2019re not friends, and they\u2019re not a team. Rather, the official connection between them is that they have all lived in the country\u2019s most important residence, whether as president or first lady \u2013 or in Hillary Clinton\u2019s case, having attempted the double. They are there to honour the missing member of this exclusive club, the woman whose death has brought them to this moment.
