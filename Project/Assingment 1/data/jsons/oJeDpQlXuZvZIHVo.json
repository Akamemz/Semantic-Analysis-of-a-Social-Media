So there are really long-term policy consequences for reducing or limiting the chances of a filibuster on this and future nominees .\nBut it 's not as earth-shattering a change as some people want to make it out to be . We 've seen movement toward majority rule in other elements of the Senate , and so in that sense it 's the natural response to previous episodes where the minority has exploited the rules and the majority has fought back and the temperature gets increasingly raised .\nThe gradual ratcheting up of partisanship has been underway since the 1980s in the Senate , and this is surely part of the natural outgrowth of that rising partisan tension . But I would n't call it the high-water mark .

There is no reason to think , after this move , that either party will respect this tradition of securing a supermajority before approving legislation . Obviously , where the Constitution requires a supermajority , those will continue , but outside of that , I doubt it . The cloture rules [ which allow the Senate to cut off debate on a topic ] are not mandated in the Constitution .\nSo what this means is that we can expect a more scorched-earth policy , and the big takeaway there is that we 're removing the institutional incentives to compromise or to move towards a more consensual position across party lines , at the very moment that parties are more divided along partisan lines than they ever have been in the 20th century . I think consensual politics across partisan lines is in a death spiral .\nSarah Binder : Looking at past episodes , minorities do n't get pushback from the majority and then lay down and call it quits . They look for new avenues to pursue their agendas in ways that take advantage of remaining rules and norms . Now , this will certainly kick up the temperature on the Democratic side , which was already high with the election of Trump . But this will raise it further and encourage them to find other ways to pursue their agenda , and to find other ways of preventing Republicans from pursuing theirs .\nThere are two solutions to the partisanship problem : either the voters stop rewarding extremism or lawmakers discover mutually beneficial compromises\nBrian Balogh : The American public will have to decide that they care more about effective governance than their party allegiances . So long as the voters reward extreme partisanship , things will get worse , not better .\nSarah Binder : One thing to keep in mind is that we do get legislative deals in polarized times . We 've been polarized for 10 or 20 years , and yet things do get done . It 's always easier to point to the things that do n't get done .
