So there is now little practical percentage for Obama in doing anything but balancing his assertion that \u201c in many communities , too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear , \u201d as he did Monday with an even-handed warning that giving in to anger \u201c by looting or carrying guns and even attacking the police only serves to raise tension and stir chaos . \u201d\nIn one sense , of course , such language is quintessentially presidential : neutral , measured and above the fray . But as Obama himself has acknowledged more than once , when it comes to the realities of daily life for African-Americans , he can never \u2014 and could hardly be expected to \u2014 divorce himself from his own experiences , including his realization that his own beloved white grandmother expressed fear of black men .\nSo it has fallen to an African-American man with a much smaller megaphone \u2014 Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson \u2014 to give personal voice to the feelings of so many black parents at the shooting of yet another unarmed black teenager .\n\u201c When this is over , I \u2019 m going to go in my son \u2019 s room , my black son \u2014 who wears his pants saggy , his hat cocked to the side , he \u2019 s got tattoos on his arms \u2014 but that \u2019 s my baby , \u201d Johnson said Sunday night at a memorial service for Brown . \u201c We need to thank Mike for his life and the change that he \u2019 s made . \u201d\nAnd even Rand Paul , who just four years ago expressed doubt about whether the central provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2014 its requirement that most private businesses serve blacks and whites alike \u2014 was constitutional , wrote last week in Time , \u201c Anyone who thinks race does not still , even if inadvertently , skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention . \u201d\nIn the worst crisis of his 2008 campaign \u2014 the controversy over inflammatory rhetoric from his Chicago pastor , the Rev . Jeremiah Wright \u2014 Obama made a stirring and candid speech on the realities of race in America , one that surely helped him win the election . His efforts to address the problem since have been fitful , with more mixed results .\nThe White House takes pains to point out that Obama \u2019 s more personal remarks in the Martin case were delivered after a jury had acquitted Martin \u2019 s assailant , George Zimmerman , of the shooting \u2014 not while an investigation was still pending ( though Obama had earlier said in the aftermath of the shooting that , \u201c If I had a son , he \u2019 d look like Trayvon \u201d ) . And in his second term , Obama has made a practice of speaking more candidly on race , as he did last month at an event for his \u201c My Brother \u2019 s Keeper \u201d initiative \u2014 an effort to focus private philanthropy on the needs of underserved black boys and young men .\n\u201c The only difference between me and extraordinarily young men that I see all across the country is I was living in a pretty forgiving environment , \u201d Obama said then . \u201c So if I made a mistake , I often had a second chance , or I often had a third chance . And some of the costs of making mistakes , they weren \u2019 t deadly . I wasn \u2019 t going to end up shot . I wasn \u2019 t going to end up in jail . \u201d\nObama \u2019 s dilemma on Ferguson boiled down to whether he should issue a statement that would leave the shooting \u2019 s passionate critics unsatisfied , or say nothing at all and appear disengaged .\n\u201c The circumstances determine the reaction , and it isn \u2019 t appropriate for the president to speak up emotionally in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department , \u201d White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said in a telephone interview . \u201c He wants the attorney general and his team to be able to conduct an independent investigation without any thumb on the scale one way or another . I think the president \u2019 s goal is to add his voice in a way that is calming , so the violence ends , and to send a message to the government officials on the ground about what his expectations are in terms of freedom to assemble , freedom of speech and freedom of the press \u2014 and also to signal to the people who have been looting and shooting that that \u2019 s not an acceptable way to honor the death of a young man . \u201d\nOther observers note that the sheer passage of time itself has required a certain recalibration of the president \u2019 s response to such incidents .\n\u201c At this point , it \u2019 s inevitable , \u201d said Raphael Sonenshein , director of the Edmund G. \u201c Pat \u201d Brown Institute of Public Affairs at the California State University Los Angeles and a student of the politics of race . \u201c Being the first black president is like being the first black mayor times 1,000 , and Tom Bradley always had to repeat , \u2018 I \u2019 m the mayor of L.A. , not the black mayor of L.A. \u2019 And he was judged very carefully in a city whose black population was about one and a half times the proportion of the U.S. as a whole .\n\u201c Both he and Obama share a natural affinity not to be particularly partisan , and yet both are deeply imbued with the black experience .
