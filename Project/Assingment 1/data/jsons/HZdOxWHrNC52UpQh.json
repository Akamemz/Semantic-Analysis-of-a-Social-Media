The paper called it \u201ca sign that his inquiry is growing in intensity.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But there\u2019s less here than meets the eye.\n\nAs an old Justice Department reporter, I can tell you this is utterly routine.

The shocker would have been if Mueller completed his investigation without bringing in a grand jury.\n\nIn fact, as the Journal story notes, there already was a grand jury, across the river in Alexandria, that the FBI was using in this case before Mueller was appointed.\n\nBut in the public mind, \u201cgrand jury\u201d is associated with \u201cindictment.\u201d And notwithstanding the old adage that a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich, the former FBI director could conclude that nothing in the case rises to an indictable offense\u2014at least as far as the president and his inner circle.\n\nWe have no way of knowing that, and neither does Mueller.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that \u201cthe development is a sign that investigators continue to aggressively gather evidence in the case.\u201d\n\nTrue. Did anyone expect anything less?\n\nUSA Today says \u201cthe move would give Mueller, a former FBI director, enormous power to subpoena documents and compel witnesses to testify under oath.\u201d\n\nYep. Which he already had.\n\nTy Cobb, the president\u2019s lawyer, told the Post: \u201cThis is news to me but it\u2019s welcome news to the extent it suggests that it may accelerate the resolution of Mr. Mueller\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense, because grand jury proceedings are supposed to be secret.
