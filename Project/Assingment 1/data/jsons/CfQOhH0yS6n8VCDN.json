    "content": "In a set of dueling interviews aired Sunday night , President Obama conceded his `` biggest disappointment '' is that he has n't significantly changed the tone in Washington since taking office -- and acknowledged sometimes his campaign ads go `` overboard '' and contain `` mistakes . ''\nMitt Romney , meanwhile , touted his campaign 's competitiveness as he emerged from a rocky week . `` We 've got a campaign which is tied with an incumbent president to the United States , '' Romney told CBS ' `` 60 Minutes . ''\nThe Republican presidential nominee said his campaign , despite heat from the media and grumbling from some conservatives , `` does n't need a turnaround . '' Romney expressed confidence he 's `` going to win this thing . ''\nThe interviews aired as both candidates were launching a new wave of campaigning . Romney arrived in Colorado Sunday for the start of a weeklong tour through battleground states . Obama 's campaign on Monday launched a new offensive with a TV ad blasting Romney for criticizing Americans who do n't pay income taxes without having `` come clean '' about his own .\nAt the same time , Obama told CBS that his ads are not always 100 percent accurate .\n`` Do we see sometimes us going overboard in our campaign , are there mistakes that are made , areas where there is no doubt that somebody could dispute how we are presenting things ? You know , that happens in politics , '' Obama said , arguing that the `` vigorous debate '' helps better define each candidate 's vision . The exchange was not aired on television but was posted online .\nAmid the sustained toughness of the campaign trail tone , Obama conceded to `` 60 Minutes '' that the tone in Washington remains more caustic than he 'd like .\n`` Change has happened and positive change for the American people , '' Obama said , adding : `` I 'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington , that I wanted to see instituted , where we were n't constantly in a political slugfest but were focused more on problem solving that , you know , I have n't fully accomplished that . ''\nObama said he has n't `` even come close in some cases . ''\n`` And , you know , if you ask me what 's my biggest disappointment , is that we have n't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked , '' the president said , adding that `` as president I bear responsibility for everything , to some degree . ''\nObama also defended his foreign policy record amid anti-American rage in the Muslim world , firing back at suggestions from Romney that the president has been weak with allies and enemies alike .\nIn the interview Sunday night the president said , `` If Gov . Romney is suggesting that we should start another war , he should say so . ''\nIn the companion interview to Obama 's appearance on CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' Romney broadened his reproach to include Israel , criticizing Obama 's failure to meet with the U.S. ally 's head of state , Benjamin Netanyahu , during the annual U.N. gathering . Romney called it a mistake that `` sends a message throughout the Middle East that somehow we distance ourselves from our friends . ''\nThe White House has said scheduling precluded a meeting between the two leaders , who wo n't be in New York at the same time . With the final six weeks of a hard-fought election hanging over the U.N. summit , Obama has opted out of face-to-face meetings with any of his counterparts -- not just Netanyahu -- during his compressed U.N. visit .\nBut Obama pushed back on the notion that he feels pressure from Netanyahu , dismissing as noise the Israeli leader 's calls for the U.S. to lay out a `` red line '' that Iran 's nuclear program must not cross to avoid American military intervention .\n`` When it comes to our national security decisions , any pressure that I feel is simply to do what 's right for the American people , '' Obama said . `` And I am going to block out any noise that 's out there . ''\nIn a wide-ranging interview conducted the day after U.S . Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed in an attack on Benghazi , Obama defended his foreign policy successes , noting he 'd followed through on a commitment to end the war in Iraq and had nabbed Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden .\nHe also waxed optimistic that winning a second term would give him a mandate to overcome obstructionism from congressional Republicans whose No . 1 goal , he said , has been to prevent his re-election .\n`` My expectation is , my hope is that that 's no longer their No . 1 priority , '' Obama said . `` I 'm hoping that after the smoke clears and the election season 's over that that spirit of cooperation comes more to the fore . ''\nRomney , in an interview conducted last week , sought to deflect attention from his running mate , Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan , over their differences in Medicare policy : `` I 'm the guy running for president , not him . ''\nWhile reaffirming his commitment to lowering all income tax rates by 20 percent , Romney expressed no unease about his refusal to offer specifics , such as which loopholes and deductions he 'd eliminate to pay for the cuts .\n`` The devil 's in the details . The angel is in the policy , which is creating more jobs , '' Romney said , adding that he does n't want to see overall government revenue reduced .\nRomney , after releasing tax returns showing he paid an effective rate of 14.1 percent last year , also defended the rate -- saying the tax on investments is relatively low `` to encourage economic growth .
