    "content": "For as long as I \u2019 ve followed global warming , advocates and activists have shared a certain faith : When the impacts get really bad , people will act .\nMaybe it will be an especially destructive hurricane , heat wave , or flood . Maybe it will be multiple disasters at once . But at some point , the severity of the problem will become self-evident , sweeping away any remaining doubt or hesitation and prompting a wave of action .\nFrom this perspective , the scary possibility is that the moment of reckoning will come too late . There \u2019 s a time lag in climate change \u2014 the effects being felt now trace back to gases emitted decades ago . By the time things get bad enough , many further devastating and irreversible changes will already be \u201c baked in \u201d by past emissions . We might not wake up in time .\nThat is indeed a scary possibility . But there is a scarier possibility , in many ways more plausible : We never really wake up at all .\nNo moment of reckoning arrives . The atmosphere becomes progressively more unstable , but it never does so fast enough , dramatically enough , to command the sustained attention of any particular generation of human beings . Instead , it is treated as rising background noise .\nThe youth climate movement continues agitating , some of the more progressive countries are roused to ( inadequate ) action , and eventually , all political parties are forced to at least acknowledge the problem \u2014 all outcomes that are foreseeable on our current trajectory \u2014 but the necessary global about-face never comes . We continue to take slow , inadequate steps to address the problem and suffer immeasurably as a result .\nDavid Wallace-Wells , author of the popular and terrifying climate change book The Uninhabitable Earth , discussed this possibility in a New York Magazine piece written during the apocalyptic fires late last year in Australia . One might have thought that fires consuming hundreds of millions of acres and killing more than a billion animals would be a wake-up call , but instead , Wallace-Wells writes , \u201c a climate disaster of unimaginable horror has been unfolding for almost two full months , and the rest of the world is hardly paying attention . \u201d\nMaybe climate chaos , a rising chorus of alarm signals from around the world , will simply become our new normal . Hell , maybe income inequality , political dysfunction , and successive waves of a deadly virus will become our new normal . Maybe we \u2019 ll just get used to [ waves hands ] all this .\nHumans often don \u2019 t remember what we \u2019 ve lost or demand that it be restored . Rather , we adjust to what we \u2019 ve got .\nConcepts developed in sociology and psychology can help us understand why it happens \u2014 and why it is such a danger in an age of accelerating , interlocking crises . Tackling climate change , pandemics , or any of a range of modern global problems means keeping our attention on what \u2019 s being lost , not just over our lifetimes , but over generations .\nIn 1995 , fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly published a one-page article in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution titled \u201c Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome in fisheries. \u201d It contained no original experiments , no numbers or equations , but it went on to be the most cited and widely discussed thing he ever wrote .\nPauly had something particular in mind about the transition from pre-scientific ( anecdotal ) to scientific data , but the conceptual architecture of shifting baselines also proved to be incredibly fruitful in other contexts and went on to be \u201c revolutionary for the field of ecology , \u201d write Jeremy Jackson ( an emeritus professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography ) and Jennifer Jacquet ( an environmental studies professor at New York University ) . The notion was later introduced to the public by filmmaker Randy Olsen in a 2002 LA Times piece and has since become a subject of much popular discussion .\nSo what are shifting baselines ? Consider a species of fish that is fished to extinction in a region over , say , 100 years . A given generation of fishers becomes conscious of the fish at a particular level of abundance . When those fishers retire , the level is lower . To the generation that enters after them , that diminished level is the new normal , the new baseline . They rarely know the baseline used by the previous generation ; it holds little emotional salience relative to their personal experience .\nAnd so it goes , each new generation shifting the baseline downward . By the end , the fishers are operating in a radically degraded ecosystem , but it does not seem that way to them , because their baselines were set at an already low level .\nOver time , the fish goes extinct \u2014 an enormous , tragic loss \u2014 but no fisher experiences the full transition from abundance to desolation . No generation experiences the totality of the loss . It is doled out in portions , over time , no portion quite large enough to spur preventative action . By the time the fish go extinct , the fishers barely notice , because they no longer valued the fish anyway .\n\u201c An animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare , \u201d says Pauly in his TED talk on shifting baselines . \u201c So you don \u2019 t lose abundant animals . You always lose rare animals . And therefore , they \u2019 re not perceived as a big loss . \u201d\nThe same phenomenon is sometimes called \u201c generational amnesia , \u201d the tendency of each generation to disregard what has come before and benchmark its own experience of nature as normal .\nA 2009 study from researchers at the Imperial College London examined a series of case studies , from \u201c hunters \u2019 perceptions of change in prey species populations in two villages in central Gabon \u201d to \u201c perceptions of bird population trends of 50 participants in a rural village in Yorkshire , UK. \u201d Sure enough , they found evidence of generational amnesia , \u201c where knowledge extinction occurs because younger generations are not aware of past biological conditions . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s easy to see the same thing happening on a larger scale with climate change . Few people are aware , in a conscious way , of how many hot summer days were normal for their parents \u2019 or grandparents \u2019 generation . Recent research shows that \u201c extremely hot summers \u201d are 200 times more likely than they were 50 years ago . Did you know that ? Do you feel it ?\nIt \u2019 s not just intergenerationally that we forget , either . The Imperial College researchers also demonstrated the existence of another form of shifting baselines syndrome : personal amnesia , \u201c where knowledge extinction occurs as individuals forget their own experience . \u201d\nJust as generations forget about ecological loss , so do individuals\nIt turns out that , over the course of their lives , individuals do just what generations do \u2014 periodically reset and readjust to new baselines .\n\u201c There is a tremendous amount of research showing that we tend to adapt to circumstances if they are constant over time , even if they are gradually worsening , \u201d says George Loewenstein , a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon . He cites the London Blitz ( during World War II , when bombs were falling on London for months on end ) and the intifada ( the Palestinian terror campaign in Israel ) , during which people slowly adjusted to unthinkable circumstances .\n\u201c Fear tends to diminish over time when a risk remains constant , \u201d he says , \u201c You can only respond for so long . After a while , it recedes to the background , seemingly no matter how bad it is . \u201d\nHe notes that big events , or \u201c teachable moments , \u201d can momentarily shock us into willingness to make big changes , but \u201c a teachable moment is only a moment , \u201d he says . \u201c Once the fear is gone , the willingness to take measures is also gone . \u201d\nEven those big personal moments fade quickly . One of the most robust findings in modern psychology \u2014 made famous by Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert \u2014 is that we have an incredibly robust \u201c psychological immune system . \u201d\nWe tend to dramatically overestimate the effect that large events , good or bad , will have on our happiness . We think the death of a family member will make us enduringly less happy , or winning the lottery will make us enduringly happier . In fact , what psychologists find again and again is that we quickly return to our personal happiness equilibrium . A soldier who loses a leg and a soldier who returns home safe to a new baby will generally , a year or two later , be roughly as happy as they were before those events . It \u2019 s called \u201c hedonic adaptation . \u201d\nJust as we adjust emotionally , we adjust cognitively . We forget what came before ; we simply don \u2019 t think about it . For the most part , only our recent experience is salient in defining our baselines , our sense of normal .\nThe process of forgetting , of resetting , is almost impossible to resist , even for those acutely aware of it . In 2013 , author JB MacKinnon released a book called The Once and Future World , about the extinction crisis and the abundant natural world that Americans are barely aware is draining away .\n\u201c Even though I spent several years writing a book about things disappearing from the natural world , \u201d MacKinnon says , \u201c I can \u2019 t hold it in my head . I have to go back and reread it in order to refresh my eyes so that when I go out into the natural world , I think , \u2018 there are things missing here \u2019 . Otherwise , I \u2019 m just gon na go , \u2018 What a beautiful day \u2019 . \u201d\n\u201c I mean , who remembers what the price of coffee was 10 years ago ? \u201d he asks .\nHumans view the world through the lens of recent experience\nUC-Davis environmental economist Frances Moore thought of a clever way to test this phenomenon of short-term salience in the context of weather .\nHow many times must unusual temperatures be repeated before they cease to be experienced by individuals as unusual ? How fast do unusual temperatures become unremarkable ? To find out , Moore and colleagues turned to Twitter . In a study published last year , they analyzed Twitter \u2019 s massive US database to correlate unusual heat or cold events with chatter about the weather . In this way , they tried to track the \u201c remarkability \u201d of temperature anomalies .\n\u201c Something crazy happens , and then the same crazy thing happens the next year , and people are able to realize , \u2018 Oh , it \u2019 s two crazy things \u2019 , \u201d Moore says . \u201c Then it starts happening again , and people start to think , \u2018 I guess this isn \u2019 t so notable anymore. \u201d Accordingly , tweets about the weather decline .\nHow quickly does the effect take hold ? \u201c The reference point for normal conditions appears to be based on weather experienced between 2 and 8 years ago , \u201d the study concluded .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a powerful phenomenon , this normalization or reference-dependent utility , \u201d Moore says . \u201c It \u2019 s not super-rational behavior . \u201d\nThe study \u2019 s conclusion about what this portends for climate change is unsettling : \u201c This rapidly shifting normal baseline means warming noticed by the general public may not be clearly distinguishable from zero over the 21st century . \u201d\nLet that sink in . Even though atmospheric temperatures are , on a geological time scale , changing at a headlong pace , on a human time scale , they are still changing too slowly to be perceptually or emotionally salient . Put more bluntly : The public may never notice that it \u2019 s getting warmer .\nResearch based on social media in a single country has obvious limitations , and Moore is reticent to speculate about how long the window of salience might be for other kinds of weather , or in other places .\nBut it stands to reason that something like the same window applies to other natural or even social phenomena . It may be just as likely that the public never notices the increasing intensity of storms or frequency of flooding or regularity of crop failures . However rapidly those phenomena might change , they rarely change fast enough to be dramatically different from conditions two to eight years ago .\nThe window of experience that humans find emotionally and cognitively salient is simply too narrow to take in long-term changes in ecological systems . What was unthinkable to previous generations \u2014 say , regular nuisance flooding in southern Florida \u2014 is normal now . What seems unthinkable to us now \u2014 say , stay-at-home orders in large swathes of the US Southwest for several weeks a year due to dangerous heat \u2014 will be , by the time it rolls around , not that much worse than what came just before it .\nWe adjust ; we can \u2019 t help it . If we wait for ecological change to thrust itself into the consciousness of ordinary Americans , we may be waiting forever .\nOnce you start thinking in terms of shifting baselines , you start seeing them everywhere , not just in ecology .\nWhat is the unending debate over the \u201c normalization \u201d of Trump but a debate over shifting baselines ? President Trump has degraded and discarded longstanding norms of presidential behavior with astonishing speed and recklessness , but it has proven incredibly difficult for the press and the public to assess his record based on pre-Trump baselines . This is why people are always asking , \u201c What if Obama did this ? \u201d They are trying to ask , \u201c Why have we shifted our moral and political baselines so quickly ? \u201d\nSimilarly , the US is busy normalizing the grim reality that college graduates will enter a world of high debt , expensive housing , and parlous job prospects . The post-war expectation of a middle-class life with a family-supporting job and a reliable pension might as well be ancient history .\nShifting baselines are evident in the steady erosion of unions , the militarization of police , and the infusion of US politics with dark money . They are even evident , as we \u2019 ll discuss in a moment , in our experience with Covid-19 .\nFor the generation of Americans coming of age today , Trump , gridlocked politics , and a rapidly warming planet are normal . How can they be convinced that they should expect , and demand , something better ?\nThe human propensity to rapidly adapt is part of our evolved cognitive and emotional machinery . But our ability to heed and remember the past is also shaped by culture .\n\u201c I looked at Native Hawaiian culture , \u201d MacKinnon says . \u201c They had individuals within communities who were assigned to have a social relationship with species that were never even given names in English. \u201d North America \u2019 s indigenous cultures still carry an enormous amount of accumulated knowledge that can help reveal what \u2019 s been lost .\nThat kind of historical consciousness \u2014 a day-to-day awareness of the obligations that come with being a good ancestor \u2014 has faded . And modern consumer capitalism might as well be designed to erase it , to lock everyone into an eternal present wherein satisfying the next material desire is the only horizon .\nOne answer is for journalism and the arts to pull the lens back and try to recenter a richer historical perspective . One ambitious effort to do that is journalist John Sutter \u2019 s Baseline 2020 project . He and his team have picked four locations around the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change \u2014 Alaska , Utah , Puerto Rico , and the Marshall Islands \u2014 and will visit them every five years until 2050 , documenting the changes facing the people who live there . ( It is modeled on director Michael Apted \u2019 s \u201c Up \u201d documentaries , which check in on the same group of Brits every seven years . )\n\u201c Change is invisible in any one moment , \u201d Sutter says . He notes that scientists often do studies that last for years or decades , but \u201c that longitudinal approach just doesn \u2019 t happen in journalism. \u201d Taking the long view is one way to make changing conditions salient and emotionally impactful .\nIn a similar spirit , artist Jonathon Keats has designed a special camera to take a 1,000-year exposure of Lake Tahoe . He calls it a \u201c sort of cognitive prosthesis , a mechanism for us to be able to see ourselves from that far-future perspective. \u201d The Long Now Foundation , established by Stewart Brand in 1996 , has been hosting seminars to spur long-term thinking for decades .\n\u201c Culture will hang on to knowledge of things that are changing or gone longer , \u201d MacKinnon says , \u201c if those things are the kinds of things that they pay attention to . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just about documenting decline , either . There have been long-term victories , too \u2014 reductions in poverty , increases in the number of educated young girls , declines in air pollution , and so forth . These also happen incrementally , often beneath our notice . We adjust our baselines upward and do not register what , over time , can be substantial victories . Making those victories more visible can help show that decline is not inevitable .\nIt can not ultimately fall to ordinary people to hold baselines stable . On these matters , as on much else , they take their cues from their leaders . Studying and understanding the long arc of history , considering the experience of previous generations and the welfare of coming generations , making decisions with the long view \u2014 those are things leaders are supposed to do .\nThe most reliable way to stop baselines from shifting is to encode the public \u2019 s values and aspirations into law and practice , through politics . They can \u2019 t be held steady through acts of collective will . They have to be hardwired into social infrastructure .\nUnfortunately , US politics has become almost completely unresponsive , which reinforces rather than ameliorates our slipping baselines . One crucial part of registering a crisis as a crisis is a sense of agency , and Americans increasingly feel that they have no ability to shape national policy .\nNegative changes \u201c are normalized more quickly if you feel like there \u2019 s nothing you can do about it , \u201d says Moore . \u201c That might be what \u2019 s going on with the coronavirus \u2014 people don \u2019 t feel like they have agency on a collective level , because the government is not doing anything , so their response is to say , \u2018 well , I got ta live my life \u2019 . \u201d\nOn top of that , it \u2019 s just tiring to feel anxious for so long . \u201c The combination of adaptation and fatigue is absolutely deadly in terms of our ability to respond to the virus at this point , \u201d says Loewenstein .\n`` White House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day , according to three people familiar with the White House \u2019 s thinking '' https : //t.co/mqD6oB1reE pic.twitter.com/J4nTAepM1M \u2014 Mark Berman ( @ markberman ) July 6 , 2020\nWhat if Americans simply accommodate themselves to thousands of coronavirus deaths a day ? As writer Charlie Warzel noted in a recent column , it \u2019 s not that different from the numbness they now feel in the face of gun violence . \u201c Unsure how \u2014 or perhaps unable \u2014 to process tragedy at scale , \u201d he writes , \u201c we get used to it . \u201d\nBiodiversity loss , deforestation , and climate change may make pandemics more common . It is not difficult to imagine Americans forgetting a time when mingling freely was taken for granted . When being in public did not mean constant low-level exposure anxiety . When there weren \u2019 t regular waves of infection and death .\n\u201c If we keep getting zoonotic disease pandemics , then we \u2019 ll just say , \u2018 well , here comes the winter one , catch you on Zoom until June \u2019 , \u201d says MacKinnon . \u201c Our baseline could shift to the point that we don \u2019 t remember there was a time when people went most of their lives without hearing the word pandemic . \u201d\nOur extraordinary ability to adapt , to get on with it , to not dwell in the past , was enormously useful in our evolutionary history . But it is making it difficult for us to keep our attention focused on how much is being lost \u2014 and thus difficult for us to rally around efforts to stem those losses .\nAnd so , little by little , a hotter , more chaotic , and more dangerous world is becoming normal to us , as we sleepwalk toward more tragedies .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

In this way, they tried to track the \u201cremarkability\u201d of temperature anomalies.\n\n\u201cSomething crazy happens, and then the same crazy thing happens the next year, and people are able to realize, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s two crazy things\u2019,\u201d Moore says. \u201cThen it starts happening again, and people start to think, \u2018I guess this isn\u2019t so notable anymore.\u201d Accordingly, tweets about the weather decline.\n\nHow quickly does the effect take hold? \u201cThe reference point for normal conditions appears to be based on weather experienced between 2 and 8 years ago,\u201d the study concluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful phenomenon, this normalization or reference-dependent utility,\u201d Moore says. \u201cIt\u2019s not super-rational behavior.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2019s conclusion about what this portends for climate change is unsettling: \u201cThis rapidly shifting normal baseline means warming noticed by the general public may not be clearly distinguishable from zero over the 21st century.\u201d\n\nLet that sink in. Even though atmospheric temperatures are, on a geological time scale, changing at a headlong pace, on a human time scale, they are still changing too slowly to be perceptually or emotionally salient. Put more bluntly: The public may never notice that it\u2019s getting warmer.\n\nResearch based on social media in a single country has obvious limitations, and Moore is reticent to speculate about how long the window of salience might be for other kinds of weather, or in other places.\n\nBut it stands to reason that something like the same window applies to other natural or even social phenomena. It may be just as likely that the public never notices the increasing intensity of storms or frequency of flooding or regularity of crop failures. However rapidly those phenomena might change, they rarely change fast enough to be dramatically different from conditions two to eight years ago.\n\nThe window of experience that humans find emotionally and cognitively salient is simply too narrow to take in long-term changes in ecological systems. What was unthinkable to previous generations \u2014 say, regular nuisance flooding in southern Florida \u2014 is normal now. What seems unthinkable to us now \u2014 say, stay-at-home orders in large swathes of the US Southwest for several weeks a year due to dangerous heat \u2014 will be, by the time it rolls around, not that much worse than what came just before it.\n\nWe adjust; we can\u2019t help it. If we wait for ecological change to thrust itself into the consciousness of ordinary Americans, we may be waiting forever.\n\nShifting baselines apply to several other social problems\n\nOnce you start thinking in terms of shifting baselines, you start seeing them everywhere, not just in ecology.\n\nWhat is the unending debate over the \u201cnormalization\u201d of Trump but a debate over shifting baselines? President Trump has degraded and discarded longstanding norms of presidential behavior with astonishing speed and recklessness, but it has proven incredibly difficult for the press and the public to assess his record based on pre-Trump baselines. This is why people are always asking, \u201cWhat if Obama did this?\u201d They are trying to ask, \u201cWhy have we shifted our moral and political baselines so quickly?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the US is busy normalizing the grim reality that college graduates will enter a world of high debt, expensive housing, and parlous job prospects. The post-war expectation of a middle-class life with a family-supporting job and a reliable pension might as well be ancient history.\n\nShifting baselines are evident in the steady erosion of unions, the militarization of police, and the infusion of US politics with dark money. They are even evident, as we\u2019ll discuss in a moment, in our experience with Covid-19.\n\nFor the generation of Americans coming of age today, Trump, gridlocked politics, and a rapidly warming planet are normal. How can they be convinced that they should expect, and demand, something better?\n\nHow to fight shifting baselines and personal amnesia\n\nThe human propensity to rapidly adapt is part of our evolved cognitive and emotional machinery. But our ability to heed and remember the past is also shaped by culture.\n\n\u201cI looked at Native Hawaiian culture,\u201d MacKinnon says. \u201cThey had individuals within communities who were assigned to have a social relationship with species that were never even given names in English.\u201d North America\u2019s indigenous cultures still carry an enormous amount of accumulated knowledge that can help reveal what\u2019s been lost.\n\nThat kind of historical consciousness \u2014 a day-to-day awareness of the obligations that come with being a good ancestor \u2014 has faded. And modern consumer capitalism might as well be designed to erase it, to lock everyone into an eternal present wherein satisfying the next material desire is the only horizon.\n\nOne answer is for journalism and the arts to pull the lens back and try to recenter a richer historical perspective. One ambitious effort to do that is journalist John Sutter\u2019s Baseline 2020 project. He and his team have picked four locations around the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change \u2014 Alaska, Utah, Puerto Rico, and the Marshall Islands \u2014 and will visit them every five years until 2050, documenting the changes facing the people who live there. (It is modeled on director Michael Apted\u2019s \u201cUp\u201d documentaries, which check in on the same group of Brits every seven years.)\n\n\u201cChange is invisible in any one moment,\u201d Sutter says. He notes that scientists often do studies that last for years or decades, but \u201cthat longitudinal approach just doesn\u2019t happen in journalism.\u201d Taking the long view is one way to make changing conditions salient and emotionally impactful.\n\nIn a similar spirit, artist Jonathon Keats has designed a special camera to take a 1,000-year exposure of Lake Tahoe. He calls it a \u201csort of cognitive prosthesis, a mechanism for us to be able to see ourselves from that far-future perspective.\u201d The Long Now Foundation, established by Stewart Brand in 1996, has been hosting seminars to spur long-term thinking for decades.\n\n\u201cCulture will hang on to knowledge of things that are changing or gone longer,\u201d MacKinnon says, \u201cif those things are the kinds of things that they pay attention to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just about documenting decline, either. There have been long-term victories, too \u2014 reductions in poverty, increases in the number of educated young girls, declines in air pollution, and so forth. These also happen incrementally, often beneath our notice. We adjust our baselines upward and do not register what, over time, can be substantial victories. Making those victories more visible can help show that decline is not inevitable.\n\nThere is no substitute for leadership and responsive governance\n\nIt can not ultimately fall to ordinary people to hold baselines stable. On these matters, as on much else, they take their cues from their leaders. Studying and understanding the long arc of history, considering the experience of previous generations and the welfare of coming generations, making decisions with the long view \u2014 those are things leaders are supposed to do.\n\nThe most reliable way to stop baselines from shifting is to encode the public\u2019s values and aspirations into law and practice, through politics. They can\u2019t be held steady through acts of collective will. They have to be hardwired into social infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately, US politics has become almost completely unresponsive, which reinforces rather than ameliorates our slipping baselines. One crucial part of registering a crisis as a crisis is a sense of agency, and Americans increasingly feel that they have no ability to shape national policy.\n\nNegative changes \u201care normalized more quickly if you feel like there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d says Moore. \u201cThat might be what\u2019s going on with the coronavirus \u2014 people don\u2019t feel like they have agency on a collective level, because the government is not doing anything, so their response is to say, \u2018well, I gotta live my life\u2019.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s just tiring to feel anxious for so long. \u201cThe combination of adaptation and fatigue is absolutely deadly in terms of our ability to respond to the virus at this point,\u201d says Loewenstein.\n\n\"White House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking\" https://t.co/mqD6oB1reE pic.twitter.com/J4nTAepM1M \u2014 Mark Berman (@markberman) July 6, 2020\n\nWhat if Americans simply accommodate themselves to thousands of coronavirus deaths a day? As writer Charlie Warzel noted in a recent column, it\u2019s not that different from the numbness they now feel in the face of gun violence. \u201cUnsure how \u2014 or perhaps unable \u2014 to process tragedy at scale,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe get used to it.\u201d\n\nBiodiversity loss, deforestation, and climate change may make pandemics more common. It is not difficult to imagine Americans forgetting a time when mingling freely was taken for granted. When being in public did not mean constant low-level exposure anxiety. When there weren\u2019t regular waves of infection and death.\n\n\u201cIf we keep getting zoonotic disease pandemics, then we\u2019ll just say, \u2018well, here comes the winter one, catch you on Zoom until June\u2019,\u201d says MacKinnon. \u201cOur baseline could shift to the point that we don\u2019t remember there was a time when people went most of their lives without hearing the word pandemic.\u201d\n\nOur extraordinary ability to adapt, to get on with it, to not dwell in the past, was enormously useful in our evolutionary history. But it is making it difficult for us to keep our attention focused on how much is being lost \u2014 and thus difficult for us to rally around efforts to stem those losses.\n\nAnd so, little by little, a hotter, more chaotic, and more dangerous world is becoming normal to us, as we sleepwalk toward more tragedies.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
