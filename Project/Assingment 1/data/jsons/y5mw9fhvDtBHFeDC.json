    "content": "Even before word came of the latest mass shooting in San Bernadino , California , lawmakers were talking about guns and mental health .\nSpeaker Paul Ryan this week said he wanted to push ahead with a mental health overhaul making its way through the House .\nAn odd couple pair of senators have been building support for a similar , less controversial , initiative in the Senate .\nNobody thinks a mental health bill , no matter how bipartisan or well-crafted , will magically make the violence disappear . And advocates worry that linking mass shootings and mental illness will add to the stigma that already haunts the mentally ill , the vast majority of whom are not violent .\nBut across the spectrum , lawmakers acknowledge that the mental health system in American needs to be fixed . And that some of the perpetrators of mass shootings have serious mental illness \u2014 and easy access to guns .\nBut again and again , when they try to fix mental health care , they get stuck \u2014 often because of the volatile politics of gun ownership in America .\nThe Senate \u2019 s No . 2 Republican , John Cornyn of Texas , has been working behind the scenes to drum up support for his own mental health legislation , which includes language endorsed by the National Rifle Association . He says he wants his bill \u2014 not the bipartisan one on track for consideration by a Senate committee early next year \u2014 to be `` the engine that pulls the train '' of mental health legislation .\nCornyn says his bill would boost the federal background check system to prevent guns from getting into the hands of those with serious mental illness . His critics say the legislation actually loosens restrictions on gun purchases , under the umbrella of mental health reform .\n\u201c The net effect of this bill would be to weaken , not strengthen , our background check system , and make it easier for people struggling with dangerous mental illness to legally access a gun , \u201d said Mark Prentice , spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions , former Rep. Gabby Giffords \u2019 gun control advocacy group .\nAny push to include guns could create a wedge in the bipartisan coalition that has been working on a mental health overhaul \u2014 and trying to keep it separate from the background check fight that has divided Washington at least since the Columbine school killings in 1999 .\nCornyn confirmed right before Thanksgiving that he \u2019 s talked to Sen. Bill Cassidy ( R-La . ) , a sponsor of the main bipartisan mental health initiative , about packaging the two bills together . A Cassidy spokesman said at that time that Cassidy , who is a co-sponsor of Cornyn 's bill , was \u201c supportive \u201d of that idea .\nAsked on Wednesday about wrapping guns into mental health legislation , Cassidy said , `` I think people may decide to do so , but if they decide to do so , it might rightly be seen as an attempt to defeat the legislation , not to advance the cause of gun control. \u201d He did not specify what type of gun measure he would find counterproductive .\nBut Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut , Cassidy 's Democratic partner on the bill gaining traction in the Senate and a progressive who is pushing separate gun control legislation , is not on board with incorporating Cornyn 's measures .\n\u201c Ultimately , he believes the final product has the greatest chance of passage if it maintains its singular focus on mental health , rather than venturing into other complex issues , \u201d Murphy \u2019 s spokesman , Chris Harris , said .\nThe motives and identities of the San Bernardino assailants are not yet clear , but after the shooting spree , Murphy showed his frustration . He tweeted that gun violence requires leaders to offer more than \u201c thoughts and prayers \u201d and in a statement he begged his colleagues to act .\n\u201c I can only pray that America \u2019 s leaders will do something \u2014 anything \u2014 that prevents more communities from knowing this sorrow . Congress \u2019 No . 1 responsibility is to keep our constituents safe , and not a single senator or member of Congress can go back to their state this weekend and claim that they are doing their job , \u201d he said .\nThe possibility of a schism arising from the Cornyn bill is disturbing both to mental health advocacy groups \u2014 many of which didn \u2019 t want to be quoted criticizing Cassidy or Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) as they move the issue ahead \u2014 and to gun control advocates .\nThe most recent time the Senate tried to pass ambitious mental health legislation , after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , sweeping proposals were whittled down . What was left failed when it was tacked onto a gun background check measure that was defeated on the floor in 2013 .\nSince then , neither the full Senate nor the House has considered comprehensive mental health legislation , although a few , more-modest initiatives have passed .\nNeither the Cassidy-Murphy bill nor the House version \u2014 sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy ( R-Pa. ) \u2014 is a done deal ; there are plenty of disputes to resolve over patient privacy , court-ordered outpatient treatment and the price tag for an overhaul .
