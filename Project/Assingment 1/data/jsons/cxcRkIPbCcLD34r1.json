    "content": "Trump began the day in a state of awe about stepping into the presidency , according to friends and aides . It was one of the few times , some said , that he seemed genuinely thrilled to be in the trappings of the White House . Fresh off the high of the previous night 's inaugural balls and with the power of the office sinking in , the new commander in chief spent part of the day playing tour guide , pulling friends into the Oval Office to tell them the history of the `` Resolute Desk '' or ushering them through his private dining room .\nTrump , a politician with legendary thin skin and little patience for protestors , was n't angered by the masses descending on Washington to protest his agenda as part of the worldwide women 's march . The chants were audible to reporters on the White House grounds but several aides said the President could n't hear them .\nStill , watching the commotion outside his new home on television , he mused with one friend about inviting some of the protesters in for a chat . A White House aide denied the idea was ever seriously considered , but said the staff briefly discussed a `` counter-programming event '' that would have brought another group of women in to meet with Trump . Ultimately , an aide said the logistics were too complex .\nTrump 's levity that morning would fizzle as the day went on . While women marched through cities across the world , Trump was more distracted by the other storyline dominating cable news that day : the inference that his inaugural crowds were much smaller than those from Obama 's 2009 inauguration . He was particularly livid about the side-by-side photographs comparing the two events .\nIn Trump 's mind , according to aides , the comparison was yet another example of efforts to delegitimize his victory , an assault on his image , his gilded brand . And he was n't going to let it go .\nHe blasted the media during an appearance before the CIA Memorial Wall , where fallen operatives are remembered . Against the backdrop of a typically somber venue , he shocked many by delivering a political speech describing his `` running war with the media , '' who he said `` are among the most dishonest human beings on earth . '' Later that day , he dispatched White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to the briefing room to press the specious claim that Trump 's crowd had been `` the largest audience to witness an inauguration , period . ''\nAllies of Trump still cite that day as an example of the fact that he has no equivalent on his staff to a James Baker , who was chief of staff to Ronald Reagan and George H.W . Bush . A senior aide in the Baker model has the freedom to tell the President `` no '' and convince him that his comments or actions could be perceived as petty and self-indulgent . The closest thing Trump has to such a confidante , according to aides , is his daughter , Ivanka , who recently stepped up her role in the White House . But , by her own admission , even she does n't always win the argument .\nWhere I disagree with my father , he knows it , and I express myself with total candor , '' she told CBS News earlier this month . `` Where I agree , I fully lean in and support the agenda .\nTrump 's preoccupation with the competing photos of inaugural crowds underscored what multiple sources who have met with him in recent months , including supporters , come away identifying as his greatest weakness : An obsessive focus on image , being admired and , most importantly , being perceived as a winner .
