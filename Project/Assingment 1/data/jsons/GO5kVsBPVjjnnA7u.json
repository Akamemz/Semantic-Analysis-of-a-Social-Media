Here we go again. \u201d At the heart of an impeachment inquiry is a nine-page whistle-blower complaint that names over two dozen people .

It was an agenda he also pushed on TV . \u201c So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden. \u201d \u201c Of course I did ! \u201d A person Giuliani worked with , Yuriy Lutsenko , Ukraine \u2019 s former prosecutor general . He pushed for investigations that would also benefit Giuliani and Trump . Lutsenko also discussed conspiracy theories about the Bidens in the U.S. media .

He served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company run by this guy , who \u2019 s had some issues with the law . While Biden was in office , he along with others , called for the dismissal of Lutsenko \u2019 s predecessor , a prosecutor named Viktor Shokin , whose office was overseeing investigations into the company that Hunter Biden was involved with . Shokin was later voted out by the Ukrainian government . Lutsenko replaced him , but was widely criticized for corruption himself . When a new president took office in May , Volodymyr Zelensky , Zelensky said that he \u2019 d replace Lutsenko . Giuliani and Trump ? Not happy . They viewed Lutsenko as their ally . During a July 25 call between Trump and the new Ukrainian president , Trump defended him , saying , \u201c I heard you had a prosecutor who is very good and he was shut down and that \u2019 s really unfair. \u201d In that phone call , Trump also allegedly asked his counterpart to continue the investigation into Joe Biden , who is his main rival in the 2020 election . Zelensky has publicly denied feeling pressured by Trump . \u201c In other words , no pressure. \u201d And then finally , Attorney General William Barr , who also came up in the July 25 call . In the reconstructed transcript , Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky \u2019 s administration could work with Barr and Giuliani to investigate the Bidens and other matters of political interest to Trump . Since the whistle-blower complaint was made public , Democrats have criticized Barr for dismissing allegations that Trump had violated campaign finance laws during his call with Zelensky and not passing along the complaint to Congress .
