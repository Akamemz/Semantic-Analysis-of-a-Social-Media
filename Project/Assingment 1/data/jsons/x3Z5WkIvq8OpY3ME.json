    "content": "HENDERSONVILLE , Tenn. \u2014 The Music City campus of the Trinity Broadcasting Network is about a half-hour drive from Music City itself , in a placid Nashville suburb on a bend in the Cumberland River where the main road through town is called the Johnny Cash Parkway . TBN , America \u2019 s largest Christian television network , acquired the complex in 1994 after the death of country singer Conway Twitty , who had operated it as a sprawling tourist attraction he called Twitty City . Last year , TBN renovated Twitty \u2019 s personal auditorium , leveling the floor , adding large neon signs and a faux-brick backdrop under the original Corinthian columns . The resulting TV set looks like an urban streetscape framed by a Greek temple .\nOn a February night , in his large office just above the auditorium , the network \u2019 s biggest star is making last-minute plans for what \u2019 s shaping up to be a busy evening . First , Mike Huckabee fields some logistics for dinner at his nearby condo , where he will host three couples who won the privilege in a charity auction . He takes a call from the actor Jon Voight , who tells Huckabee he is free to do an interview about Israel . ( Huckabee leaves the next day for Jerusalem , where TBN opened another studio a few years ago . ) He checks with one of his producers about an old \u201c Laugh-In \u201d clip Huckabee had requested . \u201c We aren \u2019 t paying $ 6,500 for it , good gosh ! \u201d he laughs when he hears the cost of the snippet . \u201c Did they point a gun at your head and wear a ski mask when you asked that ? \u201d ( They decide not to use it . )\nTwo hours later , Huckabee walks onto a stage in front of more than 200 people and kicks off a taping of his hourlong cable show . For nearly all of its 45-year history , Trinity \u2019 s programming had been strictly religious , a mix of evangelical preachers , gospel music and a flagship talk show called \u201c Praise the Lord \u201d ( now just \u201c Praise \u201d ) . But Huckabee \u2019 s show is saturated with politics . The former two-term governor of Arkansas and one-time Iowa caucus winner opens with a disquisition on the Fourth Amendment ( \u201c Our system is designed to make sure the government is your servant \u201d ) leading into a pre-taped interview with Senator Rand Paul . It \u2019 s followed by an appearance by Kayleigh McEnany , the Republican National Committee spokeswoman and a frequent campaign surrogate for Donald Trump . The crowd roars with laughter when Huckabee promises he won \u2019 t go on for as long as Nancy Pelosi , a reference to her recent filibuster-style speech on the House floor . \u201c Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi for eight hours ? \u201d he asks , chuckling . \u201c NO ! \u201d the audience shouts back .\nWhen \u201c Huckabee \u201d made its debut on TBN last fall , it immediately became the network \u2019 s highest-rated show , with more than a million viewers for a typical episode . Unlike every other show the network has produced , it is overtly political and squarely focused on current events . It has a variety component , with musical guests and comedians , and Huckabee occasionally breaks out his own bass guitar on stage . But in its six months on the air , Huckabee has also interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump-defending Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , anti-abortion activist Serrin Foster and former Senator Joe Lieberman . The very first guest on his very first show , last October , was President Trump .\nA generation ago\u2014even a few years ago\u2014this would have been unthinkable . Christian TV was largely the province of preachers , musicians , faith healers and a series of televangelism scandals . Politicians were leery of getting too close . To establishment evangelicals , not to mention the rest of America , Christian TV was hokey at best , and disreputable at worst .\nBut in the past two years , largely out of view of the coastal media and the Washington establishment , a transformation has taken place . As Christian networks have become more comfortable with politics , the Trump administration has turned them into a new pipeline for its message . Trump has forged a particularly tight marriage of convenience with Pat Robertson \u2019 s Christian Broadcasting Network , which since early in the 2016 campaign has offered consistent friendly coverage and been granted remarkable access in return . Trump personally has appeared 11 times on CBN since his campaign began ; in 2017 alone , he gave more interviews to CBN than to CNN , ABC or CBS . Trump \u2019 s Cabinet members , staffers and surrogates also appear regularly . TBN has embraced politics more gingerly\u2014it is still not a news-gathering organization\u2014but Trump has made inroads there , too , starting with his kickoff interview on \u201c Huckabee . \u201d\nThe benefits are mutual . For the networks , having White House officials regularly on screen gives new legitimacy to media organizations that have long felt looked down upon . CBN has belonged to the White House press corps for decades and occupied a seat in the White House briefing room since the Obama era . But its status has risen dramatically during the Trump presidency , when press secretary Sean Spicer gave questions to CBN reporters three times in the first two weeks of the term . During a joint news conference with Netanyahu , Trump himself picked CBN \u2019 s chief political correspondent , David Brody , to ask the first question . \u201c The Trump administration has given CBN News the opportunity to be recognized in places a Christian news organization normally wouldn \u2019 t , \u201d CBN vice president and news director Rob Allman wrote in an email .\nFor the White House , the relationship is arguably even more useful . Christian broadcasters offer an unmediated channel to the living rooms of a remarkably wide swath of American believers , an audience more politically and racially diverse than you might expect . TBN alone has more local stations to its name than Fox or the three major networks . \u201c It \u2019 s about as direct a route as you can go , \u201d says Michael Wear , a former Obama White House and campaign staffer who has appeared on CBN . They offer Trump officials a softball treatment available in few other venues . Huckabee \u2019 s own daughter , after all , is the president \u2019 s press secretary\u2014a relationship that would disqualify him as an interviewer on most networks . One of Huckabee \u2019 s questions to the president was about the first lady , and whether it bothered the president that his wife \u201c has fantastic approval ratings , soaring above anybody else in the entire city of Washington . \u201d\nTrump has appeared 11 times on CBN since his campaign began ; in 2017 alone , he gave more interviews to CBN than to CNN , ABC or CBS .\nThis dance between administration politics and televised religion is new , and is built on a connection between Trump \u2019 s message and the Christian TV worldview that runs deeper than it might first appear . It also offers a different kind of answer to the puzzle of why an impious man who can barely manage to pay lip service to actual Christian belief earned a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than predecessors including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush\u2014and why , if anything , his bond with those voters appears to be growing stronger .\nEvangelists have been a fixture of television since the 1950s , and there \u2019 s a reason politicians stayed away for so long . Almost from the start , TV preachers carried a unique whiff of tawdriness . There were the preferences for gaudy sets , big hair and absurd stunts , for one . Oklahoma televangelist Oral Roberts once told viewers that unless he received an extra $ 8 million by the next month , he would die . ( The ensuing wave of donations spared him . ) Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker opened their own theme park in the 1970s , and TBN , with its own roster of flashy preachers , still maintains its Holy Land Experience park in Orlando , Florida . Then there were the waves of legal disgrace . The \u201c Gospelgate \u201d scandals of the 1980s , implicating big-ticket televangelist Jimmy Swaggart and the Bakkers with a series of sexual and financial misdeeds , seemed to permanently tar the whole enterprise .\nNot all Christian television is televangelism , and not all televangelists are corrupt or even tacky . But American presidents have nonetheless mostly steered clear , preferring to select their religious advisers from more sober ranks of pastors and writers . ( Billy Graham , spiritual adviser to many presidents , preached on television but had roots and connections far beyond the airwaves . ) Presidents occasionally granted interviews , especially with the powerful Robertson , founder of CBN , with whom President Reagan sat down on the network \u2019 s \u201c The 700 Club \u201d in 1985\u2014but they have done so carefully and rarely .\nTrump had none of that caution . He started showing up on Christian TV years ago , giving his first interview to Brody back in 2011 , when he was toying with a run for president that no mainstream network took seriously . Trump discussed his \u201c conversion \u201d to opposing abortion , his respect for the Bible ( \u201c THE book \u201d ) and his churchgoing habits ( \u201c I go as much as I can \u201d ) . Most Republican candidates make occasional stops by CBN to woo conservative Christians . But Trump seemed to take a real shine to Brody , and he must have known he would need to put in overtime to bolster his credibility with religious voters . As his 2016 run gained momentum , a steady stream of staffers and surrogates , including Kellyanne Conway , former Representative Michele Bachmann and televangelist Paula White , appeared on the network to vouch for Trump \u2019 s Christian credentials . White told Brody in June 2016 that Trump had first discovered her ministry by watching Christian broadcasting more than a decade before . \u201c Mr . Trump has always been a huge fan , \u201d she said . \u201c He \u2019 d always watch Christian television . \u201d\nHaving White House officials regularly on screen gives new legitimacy to media organizations that have long felt looked down upon .\nWhether or not that was true , Trump seemed to sense early on that the Christian television audience would be receptive to his campaign theme of a kind of resentful nostalgia for an imagined idyllic past . When I interviewed Brody last year for a profile , he said Trump shared with older evangelicals a longing for \u201c 1950s America , \u201d characterized by patriotism , prayer in school and an absence of political correctness ( though he took pains to clarify that the \u2019 50s were not a good era for \u201c race relations \u201d ) . As Huckabee puts it on one of his promos on TBN , \u201c If you like baseball , apple pie and you love your mom , I \u2019 ve got just the show for you . \u201d\nBut if Trump detected a cultural affinity with viewers of Christian television , he was also capitalizing on a deliberate turn that the medium was already taking . On TBN , \u201c Huckabee \u201d is part of a change under the leadership of Matt Crouch , who took over recently from his father , Paul , who founded the network back in 1973 . The talk show is the network \u2019 s most obvious nod to politics , but in the past few years it has also added a newsmagazine show called \u201c The Watchman , \u201d focused on \u201c gathering threats to America \u2019 s and Israel \u2019 s security \u201d \u2014it \u2019 s hard to overstate Christian TV \u2019 s interest in Israel\u2014and started airing \u201c Somebody \u2019 s Got ta Do It , \u201d in which blue-collar conservative Mike Rowe visits \u201c hardworking Americans \u201d on the job . ( Rowe \u2019 s show originally aired on CNN ; TBN recut the episodes to include scenes like family prayers and snipped out mild cursing . ) This is , in part , an effort to reach a new audience of millennials who aren \u2019 t as interested in watching sermons on TV . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to get beyond the church , beyond the pews , \u201d Colby May , a TBN board member , said of the network \u2019 s new direction . May says TBN isn \u2019 t trying to emphasize politics per se , but to be seen as more relevant . Huckabee \u2019 s interview with Trump \u201c was an exciting and different kind of guest for Christian television , \u201d he says .\nCBN , for its part , had been in the news business since the 1970s , when the network opened a bureau in Washington , and \u201c The 700 Club \u201d transformed from a variety show into its current newsmagazine format . Robertson relishes his role as a kind of ward heeler of the Christian conservative vote , and candidates courting that vote would make obligatory campaign stops on CBN . But Robertson \u2019 s own pronouncements on current events seemed enough to keep mainstream politicians at arm \u2019 s length : Since the peak of his influence in the 1980s , he has become better known for dire predictions based on divine revelation , his notorious linkage of Hurricane Katrina to American abortion policy and his repeated insistence that Islam is less a religion than a dangerous political system .\nIf that last point sounds like something you might have heard at a Trump campaign rally , that begins to get at the affinity between Trumpworld and this particular set of TV viewers . In retrospect , it \u2019 s possible to see Robertson as a kind of elder statesman of the exact kind of \u201c politically incorrect \u201d conservative populism that Trump \u2019 s campaign rhetoric tapped into so naturally . A viewer who had stuck with Robertson through all that wasn \u2019 t likely to be put off by a candidate who took potshots at Mexicans and Muslims .\nBy the time Trump arrived on the political scene , it almost didn \u2019 t matter that he wasn \u2019 t much of a Christian , or tended to mangle the names of the books of the Bible . This audience recognized him as a kindred spirit in everything but religion . His hair-sprayed reality-TV persona\u2014to say nothing of the bluster and the heroic monologues\u2014aren \u2019 t that far from the preaching style that has prospered on cable evangelism . His family \u2019 s pastor when he was a child wasn \u2019 t the minister of the local Presbyterian church , but celebrity success guru Norman Vincent Peale , who had a long-running radio show called \u201c The Art of Living. \u201d Trump ran his campaign events more like tent revivals than policy symposia . And his books and TV persona dovetailed surprisingly well with the \u201c prosperity gospel \u201d preaching that thrives on Christian TV , the relatively new American theology in which material wealth is seen not only as a reward for good behavior , but a kind of endorsement by God .\nToday , Christian broadcasters have rewarded Trump not just with airtime for his surrogates , but with uncritical , often defensive coverage of his administration . Appearing as a guest on \u201c The Jim Bakker Show \u201d soon after the racial violence in Charlottesville , Virginia , last summer , Paula White compared Trump to the biblical queen Esther , and told viewers that opposing the president meant \u201c fighting against the hand of God. \u201d CBN \u2019 s Brody this year published a hagiographic \u201c spiritual biography \u201d of the president , The Faith of Donald J. Trump , in which he argues that Trump is on a \u201c spiritual voyage \u201d that has landed him surrounded by believers in the Oval Office . The president obligingly sat down for an interview for the book and later promoted it on Twitter as \u201c a very interesting read . \u201d\nCBN 1 . Melania Trump on \u201c The Brody File \u201d ; 2 . Adviser Kellyanne Conway on \u201c The Brody File \u201d ; 3 . President Donald Trump on \u201c The Brody File \u201d ; 4 . United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley on \u201c The 700 Club \u201d ; 5 . Attorney General Jeff Sessions on \u201c Faith Nation \u201d ; 6 . Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on CBN News ; 7 . Vice President Mike Pence on CBN News ; 8 . Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt on CBN News ; 9 . Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on CBN News\nTo watch an appearance by a Trump official on \u201c The 700 Club , \u201d or \u201c Faith Nation , \u201d the Washington-based political show hosted by Brody and Jenna Browder that debuted last summer , is to enter a softer precinct of the news universe , one in which officials are treated gently and allowed to air out their views with help , not challenge , from the hosts . When Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney appeared on CBN days after the brief government shutdown in January , he discussed policy issues including immigration and the possibility of passing a spending bill . When Brody asked him about what he would say to Hispanic Christians worried about deportation , Mulvaney reassured them that the president \u201c wants to figure out a way for the DACA folks to stay. \u201d Brody didn \u2019 t push him with a follow-up . In December , Vice President Mike Pence went on Brody \u2019 s show in part just to reassure evangelicals that Trump is on their team . \u201c The president is a believer , and so am I , \u201d Pence told Brody . \u201c The American people , I think , can be encouraged to know that in President Donald Trump , they have a leader who embraces and respects and appreciates the role of faith and the importance of religion in the lives of our families , in communities in our nation , and he always will . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just a \u201c trust me \u201d argument : Trump has actually delivered the goods in Washington , especially for this particular strain of evangelicals . And he has brought more televangelists and Christian broadcasters into his inner circle than any president before him . White , arguably his closest spiritual adviser , hosted a show that aired on TBN and BET for years . His lawyer , Jay Sekulow , has his own daily call-in radio show on a Christian network . Trump \u2019 s faith advisory board , announced during the campaign , included many members drawn from the world of television ministry , including Ken and Gloria Copeland , who have headed a daily program since 1989 ; Tony Suarez , who hosts a talk show on TBN \u2019 s Hispanic-oriented network ; Jentezen Franklin and Robert Jeffress , whose sermons air as their own programs on TBN ; and Mark Burns , who founded the web-based NOW Network . Johnnie Moore , another advisory board member , is a communications consultant who has worked with clients including CBN . \u201c If you look at his evangelical advisory council , it \u2019 s people with media connections , more than broad church-based connections , \u201d Robert Jones , CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute , says . \u201c That \u2019 s a weird slice of the evangelical world . \u201d\nCloser to Trump \u2019 s inner circle , the list of friendly faces continues . \u201c This is an evangelical Cabinet , \u201d says Jerry Johnson , president of the National Religious Broadcasters . \u201c You \u2019 re looking at name-brand conservative evangelicals that are very comfortable talking to Christian media types. \u201d Jeff Sessions , Scott Pruitt , Rick Perry , Ben Carson and Pence , all evangelical Christians who talk frequently about faith , are among those who have appeared on CBN since Trump took office . And CBN has closely covered what it calls a \u201c spiritual awakening \u201d at the White House , including Oval Office prayers and a weekly Bible study involving many Cabinet members , at one point including Betsy DeVos and the now-departed Tom Price .\nPence , who himself hosted a conservative talk-radio show and a television show in Indiana in the 1990s , has been a particularly cheerful booster of the work of Christian broadcasters . Speaking at the 75th annual meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters in February , Pence praised its membership \u2019 s work . \u201c Your ministry , your message , your values are needed now more than ever before , \u201d he told the crowd in Nashville . \u201c Every day , every hour , you speak strength to the heart of the American people . You shape our country. \u201d ( Christian radio is a different business with a somewhat different audience , but it has proved similarly attractive to Trump . Salem Media Group , the largest Christian radio broadcasting platform in the country , spent a day at the White House last summer , hosting a special broadcast with the theme \u201c Made in America . \u201d )\nThe audience Christian TV is delivering has a surprising kind of political traction , especially if you lost track of Christian broadcasting after the scandals of the 1980s . \u201c Decline is such an easy narrative , \u201d says Mark Ward , editor of the 2015 book The Electronic Church in the Digital Age . \u201c What really happened is [ televangelism ] went underground . \u201d\nNewer TV preachers might not be national celebrities with the name recognition of Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart , but they remain influential . Reliable data on the sector are hard to come by , but a 2005 survey by an evangelical pollster found that 45 percent of American adults watched Christian television on a monthly basis , just as many as in 1992 . \u201c It \u2019 s one of these stories that has just gone completely under the radar , \u201d Ward says . \u201c Even though it doesn \u2019 t have the same profile it had , it \u2019 s still a very decisive arbiter of the evangelical subculture . \u201d\nTBN in particular has quietly become a major player , in part by capitalizing on the switch to digital TV two decades ago . When the Federal Communications Commission declared in 1996 that all television stations had to convert to digital broadcasting within a decade , the network \u2019 s founders , Paul and Jan Crouch , snapped up many local Christian stations that couldn \u2019 t afford the conversion . As a result , TBN is now the third-largest television group in the country , with access to 100 million households and more local television stations to its name than Fox or the three major networks . Its largest rival , Texas-based Daystar , also claims access to 100 million households , and carries many of the same programs . ( CBN is no longer technically a network but a production company with a series of syndicated programs that air on stations owned by others , including TBN . )\nThe networks haven \u2019 t escaped the whiff of scandal , particularly TBN , which was hit by another series of negative headlines just within the past few years , including lawsuits and a family feud that left Matt Crouch in charge . Last summer , a California jury awarded Paul and Jan Crouch \u2019 s granddaughter $ 2 million after she said she had been sexually abused by a TBN employee . There are also questions about its financial health : When the Orange County Registerreviewed the company \u2019 s tax filings in 2016 , it found a revenue drop from $ 207 million in 2006 to $ 121.5 million in 2014 . About five years ago , TBN banished its fundraising \u201c praise-a-thons , \u201d which relied largely on small donations from low-income viewers , and now relies more on underwriting and traditional fundraising efforts . Last year , the network sold at least two significant properties in Southern California , including its gaudy headquarters in Costa Mesa .\nIf you look at his evangelical advisory council , it \u2019 s people with media connections . \u2026 That \u2019 s a weird slice of the evangelical world . \u201d\nBut viewers still appear to be loyal , and those viewers aren \u2019 t who you might think . Both TBN and CBN say their audiences are split almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans . This can likely be chalked up to another fact that might surprise people outside the evangelical bubble : their audiences \u2019 racial diversity . Charismatic and Pentecostal preaching , and the related health-and-wealth \u201c prosperity gospel , \u201d are strong traditions within the black community . Popular black pastors including Creflo Dollar , Tony Evans and TD Jakes have all preached regularly over the years on TBN , Daystar , and other Christian networks . Paula White is the pastor of a largely black church . And CBN \u2019 s roster of reporters , hosts and regular guests is arguably more racially diverse than those of many cable news networks .\nWear , the faith outreach director for the 2012 Obama campaign , believes the racial diversity of Christian broadcasting has helped inoculate Trump against charges of racism among his white evangelical voters . CBN and TBN \u2019 s on-air diversity \u201c is a significant reason that much of Trump \u2019 s base doesn \u2019 t take accusations of racism seriously , \u201d he says .\nIn October , TBN aired a special on the American church \u2019 s role in racial reconciliation , hosted by pastor Samuel Rodriguez , who prayed at Trump \u2019 s inauguration . The year before , Rodriguez appeared on CBN to assure viewers that Trump is not a racist . In an interview taped for \u201c Huckabee \u201d in February , Harry Jackson , a black pastor in Maryland who has frequently defended Trump , told Huckabee the same thing .\nFor white evangelicals , who voted for Trump overwhelmingly and still approve of his job performance , the approach seems to be working . The networks continually polish Trump \u2019 s reputation , and perhaps more importantly , he \u2019 s talking to them . \u201c Evangelicals , going back to the time of the Scopes trial , have always been sensitive to being seen as pariahs , \u201d Mark Ward says . \u201c You can get a lot of credibility with evangelicals if you simply make them feel like they matter , if you appear on their TV shows and send your administration to appear on their TV shows . \u201d\nIn a fundamental way , TV people are Trump \u2019 s people . \u201c Trump appreciates people who can communicate in an attention-grabbing way , \u201d says Wear , author of the 2017 book Reclaiming Hope : Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America . \u201c I don \u2019 t think Trump would be drawn to a preacher who breaks down five chapters of Ephesians and lays out the Greek and Aramaic . \u201d\nTrump has always had a particular genius for circumventing normal channels , and he seems to understand the power of Christian television as a medium for directly reaching an important and particularly loyal segment of his base . When Pat Robertson interviewed him last summer , in a period in which Trump had granted no other non-Fox interviews for months , the president put it succinctly . \u201c As long as my people understand , \u201d he told Robertson . \u201c That \u2019 s why I do interviews with you . You have a tremendous audience . You have people that I love . \u201d",

First, Mike Huckabee fields some logistics for dinner at his nearby condo, where he will host three couples who won the privilege in a charity auction. He takes a call from the actor Jon Voight, who tells Huckabee he is free to do an interview about Israel.

For nearly all of its 45-year history, Trinity\u2019s programming had been strictly religious, a mix of evangelical preachers, gospel music and a flagship talk show called \u201cPraise the Lord\u201d (now just \u201cPraise\u201d).

It\u2019s followed by an appearance by Kayleigh McEnany, the Republican National Committee spokeswoman and a frequent campaign surrogate for Donald Trump. The crowd roars with laughter when Huckabee promises he won\u2019t go on for as long as Nancy Pelosi, a reference to her recent filibuster-style speech on the House floor. \u201cCan you imagine Nancy Pelosi for eight hours?\u201d he asks, chuckling. \u201cNO!\u201d the audience shouts back.\n\nWhen \u201cHuckabee\u201d made its debut on TBN last fall, it immediately became the network\u2019s highest-rated show, with more than a million viewers for a typical episode. Unlike every other show the network has produced, it is overtly political and squarely focused on current events. It has a variety component, with musical guests and comedians, and Huckabee occasionally breaks out his own bass guitar on stage. But in its six months on the air, Huckabee has also interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump-defending Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, anti-abortion activist Serrin Foster and former Senator Joe Lieberman. The very first guest on his very first show, last October, was President Trump.\n\nA generation ago\u2014even a few years ago\u2014this would have been unthinkable.

To establishment evangelicals, not to mention the rest of America, Christian TV was hokey at best, and disreputable at worst.\n\nBut in the past two years, largely out of view of the coastal media and the Washington establishment, a transformation has taken place. As Christian networks have become more comfortable with politics, the Trump administration has turned them into a new pipeline for its message.

Trump personally has appeared 11 times on CBN since his campaign began; in 2017 alone, he gave more interviews to CBN than to CNN, ABC or CBS. Trump\u2019s Cabinet members, staffers and surrogates also appear regularly. TBN has embraced politics more gingerly\u2014it is still not a news-gathering organization\u2014but Trump has made inroads there, too, starting with his kickoff interview on \u201cHuckabee.\u201d\n\nIllustration by Chris Gash\n\nThe benefits are mutual. For the networks, having White House officials regularly on screen gives new legitimacy to media organizations that have long felt looked down upon. CBN has belonged to the White House press corps for decades and occupied a seat in the White House briefing room since the Obama era. But its status has risen dramatically during the Trump presidency, when press secretary Sean Spicer gave questions to CBN reporters three times in the first two weeks of the term. During a joint news conference with Netanyahu, Trump himself picked CBN\u2019s chief political correspondent, David Brody, to ask the first question. \u201cThe Trump administration has given CBN News the opportunity to be recognized in places a Christian news organization normally wouldn\u2019t,\u201d CBN vice president and news director Rob Allman wrote in an email.\n\nFor the White House, the relationship is arguably even more useful. Christian broadcasters offer an unmediated channel to the living rooms of a remarkably wide swath of American believers, an audience more politically and racially diverse than you might expect. TBN alone has more local stations to its name than Fox or the three major networks. \u201cIt\u2019s about as direct a route as you can go,\u201d says Michael Wear, a former Obama White House and campaign staffer who has appeared on CBN. They offer Trump officials a softball treatment available in few other venues. Huckabee\u2019s own daughter, after all, is the president\u2019s press secretary\u2014a relationship that would disqualify him as an interviewer on most networks. One of Huckabee\u2019s questions to the president was about the first lady, and whether it bothered the president that his wife \u201chas fantastic approval ratings, soaring above anybody else in the entire city of Washington.\u201d\n\nTrump has appeared 11 times on CBN since his campaign began; in 2017 alone, he gave more interviews to CBN than to CNN, ABC or CBS.\n\nThis dance between administration politics and televised religion is new, and is built on a connection between Trump\u2019s message and the Christian TV worldview that runs deeper than it might first appear. It also offers a different kind of answer to the puzzle of why an impious man who can barely manage to pay lip service to actual Christian belief earned a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than predecessors including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush\u2014and why, if anything, his bond with those voters appears to be growing stronger.\n\n\n\n***\n\nEvangelists have been a fixture of television since the 1950s, and there\u2019s a reason politicians stayed away for so long. Almost from the start, TV preachers carried a unique whiff of tawdriness. There were the preferences for gaudy sets, big hair and absurd stunts, for one. Oklahoma televangelist Oral Roberts once told viewers that unless he received an extra $8 million by the next month, he would die. (The ensuing wave of donations spared him.) Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker opened their own theme park in the 1970s, and TBN, with its own roster of flashy preachers, still maintains its Holy Land Experience park in Orlando, Florida. Then there were the waves of legal disgrace. The \u201cGospelgate\u201d scandals of the 1980s, implicating big-ticket televangelist Jimmy Swaggart and the Bakkers with a series of sexual and financial misdeeds, seemed to permanently tar the whole enterprise.\n\nNot all Christian television is televangelism, and not all televangelists are corrupt or even tacky. But American presidents have nonetheless mostly steered clear, preferring to select their religious advisers from more sober ranks of pastors and writers. (Billy Graham, spiritual adviser to many presidents, preached on television but had roots and connections far beyond the airwaves.) Presidents occasionally granted interviews, especially with the powerful Robertson, founder of CBN, with whom President Reagan sat down on the network\u2019s \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d in 1985\u2014but they have done so carefully and rarely.\n\nTrump had none of that caution. He started showing up on Christian TV years ago, giving his first interview to Brody back in 2011, when he was toying with a run for president that no mainstream network took seriously. Trump discussed his \u201cconversion\u201d to opposing abortion, his respect for the Bible (\u201cTHE book\u201d) and his churchgoing habits (\u201cI go as much as I can\u201d). Most Republican candidates make occasional stops by CBN to woo conservative Christians. But Trump seemed to take a real shine to Brody, and he must have known he would need to put in overtime to bolster his credibility with religious voters. As his 2016 run gained momentum, a steady stream of staffers and surrogates, including Kellyanne Conway, former Representative Michele Bachmann and televangelist Paula White, appeared on the network to vouch for Trump\u2019s Christian credentials. White told Brody in June 2016 that Trump had first discovered her ministry by watching Christian broadcasting more than a decade before. \u201cMr. Trump has always been a huge fan,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d always watch Christian television.\u201d\n\nHaving White House officials regularly on screen gives new legitimacy to media organizations that have long felt looked down upon.\n\nWhether or not that was true, Trump seemed to sense early on that the Christian television audience would be receptive to his campaign theme of a kind of resentful nostalgia for an imagined idyllic past. When I interviewed Brody last year for a profile, he said Trump shared with older evangelicals a longing for \u201c1950s America,\u201d characterized by patriotism, prayer in school and an absence of political correctness (though he took pains to clarify that the \u201950s were not a good era for \u201crace relations\u201d). As Huckabee puts it on one of his promos on TBN, \u201cIf you like baseball, apple pie and you love your mom, I\u2019ve got just the show for you.\u201d\n\nBut if Trump detected a cultural affinity with viewers of Christian television, he was also capitalizing on a deliberate turn that the medium was already taking. On TBN, \u201cHuckabee\u201d is part of a change under the leadership of Matt Crouch, who took over recently from his father, Paul, who founded the network back in 1973. The talk show is the network\u2019s most obvious nod to politics, but in the past few years it has also added a newsmagazine show called \u201cThe Watchman,\u201d focused on \u201cgathering threats to America\u2019s and Israel\u2019s security\u201d\u2014it\u2019s hard to overstate Christian TV\u2019s interest in Israel\u2014and started airing \u201cSomebody\u2019s Gotta Do It,\u201d in which blue-collar conservative Mike Rowe visits \u201chardworking Americans\u201d on the job. (Rowe\u2019s show originally aired on CNN; TBN recut the episodes to include scenes like family prayers and snipped out mild cursing.) This is, in part, an effort to reach a new audience of millennials who aren\u2019t as interested in watching sermons on TV. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond the church, beyond the pews,\u201d Colby May, a TBN board member, said of the network\u2019s new direction. May says TBN isn\u2019t trying to emphasize politics per se, but to be seen as more relevant. Huckabee\u2019s interview with Trump \u201cwas an exciting and different kind of guest for Christian television,\u201d he says.\n\nCBN, for its part, had been in the news business since the 1970s, when the network opened a bureau in Washington, and \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d transformed from a variety show into its current newsmagazine format. Robertson relishes his role as a kind of ward heeler of the Christian conservative vote, and candidates courting that vote would make obligatory campaign stops on CBN. But Robertson\u2019s own pronouncements on current events seemed enough to keep mainstream politicians at arm\u2019s length: Since the peak of his influence in the 1980s, he has become better known for dire predictions based on divine revelation, his notorious linkage of Hurricane Katrina to American abortion policy and his repeated insistence that Islam is less a religion than a dangerous political system.\n\nIf that last point sounds like something you might have heard at a Trump campaign rally, that begins to get at the affinity between Trumpworld and this particular set of TV viewers. In retrospect, it\u2019s possible to see Robertson as a kind of elder statesman of the exact kind of \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d conservative populism that Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric tapped into so naturally. A viewer who had stuck with Robertson through all that wasn\u2019t likely to be put off by a candidate who took potshots at Mexicans and Muslims.\n\nBy the time Trump arrived on the political scene, it almost didn\u2019t matter that he wasn\u2019t much of a Christian, or tended to mangle the names of the books of the Bible. This audience recognized him as a kindred spirit in everything but religion. His hair-sprayed reality-TV persona\u2014to say nothing of the bluster and the heroic monologues\u2014aren\u2019t that far from the preaching style that has prospered on cable evangelism. His family\u2019s pastor when he was a child wasn\u2019t the minister of the local Presbyterian church, but celebrity success guru Norman Vincent Peale, who had a long-running radio show called \u201cThe Art of Living.\u201d Trump ran his campaign events more like tent revivals than policy symposia. And his books and TV persona dovetailed surprisingly well with the \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d preaching that thrives on Christian TV, the relatively new American theology in which material wealth is seen not only as a reward for good behavior, but a kind of endorsement by God.\n\n\n\n***\n\nToday, Christian broadcasters have rewarded Trump not just with airtime for his surrogates, but with uncritical, often defensive coverage of his administration. Appearing as a guest on \u201cThe Jim Bakker Show\u201d soon after the racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer, Paula White compared Trump to the biblical queen Esther, and told viewers that opposing the president meant \u201cfighting against the hand of God.\u201d CBN\u2019s Brody this year published a hagiographic \u201cspiritual biography\u201d of the president, The Faith of Donald J. Trump, in which he argues that Trump is on a \u201cspiritual voyage\u201d that has landed him surrounded by believers in the Oval Office. The president obligingly sat down for an interview for the book and later promoted it on Twitter as \u201ca very interesting read.\u201d\n\nCBN 1. Melania Trump on \u201cThe Brody File\u201d; 2. Adviser Kellyanne Conway on \u201cThe Brody File\u201d; 3. President Donald Trump on \u201cThe Brody File\u201d; 4. United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley on \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d; 5. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on \u201cFaith Nation\u201d; 6. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on CBN News; 7. Vice President Mike Pence on CBN News; 8. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt on CBN News; 9. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on CBN News\n\nTo watch an appearance by a Trump official on \u201cThe 700 Club,\u201d or \u201cFaith Nation,\u201d the Washington-based political show hosted by Brody and Jenna Browder that debuted last summer, is to enter a softer precinct of the news universe, one in which officials are treated gently and allowed to air out their views with help, not challenge, from the hosts. When Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney appeared on CBN days after the brief government shutdown in January, he discussed policy issues including immigration and the possibility of passing a spending bill. When Brody asked him about what he would say to Hispanic Christians worried about deportation, Mulvaney reassured them that the president \u201cwants to figure out a way for the DACA folks to stay.\u201d Brody didn\u2019t push him with a follow-up. In December, Vice President Mike Pence went on Brody\u2019s show in part just to reassure evangelicals that Trump is on their team. \u201cThe president is a believer, and so am I,\u201d Pence told Brody. \u201cThe American people, I think, can be encouraged to know that in President Donald Trump, they have a leader who embraces and respects and appreciates the role of faith and the importance of religion in the lives of our families, in communities in our nation, and he always will.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just a \u201ctrust me\u201d argument: Trump has actually delivered the goods in Washington, especially for this particular strain of evangelicals. And he has brought more televangelists and Christian broadcasters into his inner circle than any president before him. White, arguably his closest spiritual adviser, hosted a show that aired on TBN and BET for years. His lawyer, Jay Sekulow, has his own daily call-in radio show on a Christian network. Trump\u2019s faith advisory board, announced during the campaign, included many members drawn from the world of television ministry, including Ken and Gloria Copeland, who have headed a daily program since 1989; Tony Suarez, who hosts a talk show on TBN\u2019s Hispanic-oriented network; Jentezen Franklin and Robert Jeffress, whose sermons air as their own programs on TBN; and Mark Burns, who founded the web-based NOW Network. Johnnie Moore, another advisory board member, is a communications consultant who has worked with clients including CBN. \u201cIf you look at his evangelical advisory council, it\u2019s people with media connections, more than broad church-based connections,\u201d Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, says. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird slice of the evangelical world.\u201d\n\nCloser to Trump\u2019s inner circle, the list of friendly faces continues. \u201cThis is an evangelical Cabinet,\u201d says Jerry Johnson, president of the National Religious Broadcasters. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at name-brand conservative evangelicals that are very comfortable talking to Christian media types.\u201d Jeff Sessions, Scott Pruitt, Rick Perry, Ben Carson and Pence, all evangelical Christians who talk frequently about faith, are among those who have appeared on CBN since Trump took office. And CBN has closely covered what it calls a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d at the White House, including Oval Office prayers and a weekly Bible study involving many Cabinet members, at one point including Betsy DeVos and the now-departed Tom Price.\n\nPence, who himself hosted a conservative talk-radio show and a television show in Indiana in the 1990s, has been a particularly cheerful booster of the work of Christian broadcasters. Speaking at the 75th annual meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters in February, Pence praised its membership\u2019s work. \u201cYour ministry, your message, your values are needed now more than ever before,\u201d he told the crowd in Nashville. \u201cEvery day, every hour, you speak strength to the heart of the American people. You shape our country.\u201d (Christian radio is a different business with a somewhat different audience, but it has proved similarly attractive to Trump. Salem Media Group, the largest Christian radio broadcasting platform in the country, spent a day at the White House last summer, hosting a special broadcast with the theme \u201cMade in America.\u201d)\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe audience Christian TV is delivering has a surprising kind of political traction, especially if you lost track of Christian broadcasting after the scandals of the 1980s. \u201cDecline is such an easy narrative,\u201d says Mark Ward, editor of the 2015 book The Electronic Church in the Digital Age. \u201cWhat really happened is [televangelism] went underground.\u201d\n\nNewer TV preachers might not be national celebrities with the name recognition of Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart, but they remain influential. Reliable data on the sector are hard to come by, but a 2005 survey by an evangelical pollster found that 45 percent of American adults watched Christian television on a monthly basis, just as many as in 1992. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these stories that has just gone completely under the radar,\u201d Ward says. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t have the same profile it had, it\u2019s still a very decisive arbiter of the evangelical subculture.\u201d\n\nIllustration by Chris Gash\n\nTBN in particular has quietly become a major player, in part by capitalizing on the switch to digital TV two decades ago. When the Federal Communications Commission declared in 1996 that all television stations had to convert to digital broadcasting within a decade, the network\u2019s founders, Paul and Jan Crouch, snapped up many local Christian stations that couldn\u2019t afford the conversion. As a result, TBN is now the third-largest television group in the country, with access to 100 million households and more local television stations to its name than Fox or the three major networks. Its largest rival, Texas-based Daystar, also claims access to 100 million households, and carries many of the same programs. (CBN is no longer technically a network but a production company with a series of syndicated programs that air on stations owned by others, including TBN.)\n\nThe networks haven\u2019t escaped the whiff of scandal, particularly TBN, which was hit by another series of negative headlines just within the past few years, including lawsuits and a family feud that left Matt Crouch in charge. Last summer, a California jury awarded Paul and Jan Crouch\u2019s granddaughter $2 million after she said she had been sexually abused by a TBN employee. There are also questions about its financial health: When the Orange County Registerreviewed the company\u2019s tax filings in 2016, it found a revenue drop from $207 million in 2006 to $121.5 million in 2014. About five years ago, TBN banished its fundraising \u201cpraise-a-thons,\u201d which relied largely on small donations from low-income viewers, and now relies more on underwriting and traditional fundraising efforts. Last year, the network sold at least two significant properties in Southern California, including its gaudy headquarters in Costa Mesa.\n\nIf you look at his evangelical advisory council, it\u2019s people with media connections. \u2026 That\u2019s a weird slice of the evangelical world.\u201d\n\nBut viewers still appear to be loyal, and those viewers aren\u2019t who you might think. Both TBN and CBN say their audiences are split almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans. This can likely be chalked up to another fact that might surprise people outside the evangelical bubble: their audiences\u2019 racial diversity. Charismatic and Pentecostal preaching, and the related health-and-wealth \u201cprosperity gospel,\u201d are strong traditions within the black community. Popular black pastors including Creflo Dollar, Tony Evans and TD Jakes have all preached regularly over the years on TBN, Daystar, and other Christian networks. Paula White is the pastor of a largely black church. And CBN\u2019s roster of reporters, hosts and regular guests is arguably more racially diverse than those of many cable news networks.\n\nWear, the faith outreach director for the 2012 Obama campaign, believes the racial diversity of Christian broadcasting has helped inoculate Trump against charges of racism among his white evangelical voters. CBN and TBN\u2019s on-air diversity \u201cis a significant reason that much of Trump\u2019s base doesn\u2019t take accusations of racism seriously,\u201d he says.\n\nIn October, TBN aired a special on the American church\u2019s role in racial reconciliation, hosted by pastor Samuel Rodriguez, who prayed at Trump\u2019s inauguration. The year before, Rodriguez appeared on CBN to assure viewers that Trump is not a racist. In an interview taped for \u201cHuckabee\u201d in February, Harry Jackson, a black pastor in Maryland who has frequently defended Trump, told Huckabee the same thing.\n\nFor white evangelicals, who voted for Trump overwhelmingly and still approve of his job performance, the approach seems to be working. The networks continually polish Trump\u2019s reputation, and perhaps more importantly, he\u2019s talking to them. \u201cEvangelicals, going back to the time of the Scopes trial, have always been sensitive to being seen as pariahs,\u201d Mark Ward says. \u201cYou can get a lot of credibility with evangelicals if you simply make them feel like they matter, if you appear on their TV shows and send your administration to appear on their TV shows.\u201d\n\nIn a fundamental way, TV people are Trump\u2019s people. \u201cTrump appreciates people who can communicate in an attention-grabbing way,\u201d says Wear, author of the 2017 book Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump would be drawn to a preacher who breaks down five chapters of Ephesians and lays out the Greek and Aramaic.\u201d\n\nTrump has always had a particular genius for circumventing normal channels, and he seems to understand the power of Christian television as a medium for directly reaching an important and particularly loyal segment of his base. When Pat Robertson interviewed him last summer, in a period in which Trump had granted no other non-Fox interviews for months, the president put it succinctly. \u201cAs long as my people understand,\u201d he told Robertson. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do interviews with you. You have a tremendous audience. You have people that I love.\u201d",
