And in that sense , this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31 .\nWhen President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U.S. election just concluded , some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures `` appropriate '' but also `` overdue '' and `` a prime example of this administration 's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world . ''\n`` [ We have ] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia 's worldwide aggression , including its cyber-hacking operations , '' wrote Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .\n`` Now with just a few weeks left in office , the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted . ''\nAppearing on CNN , frequent Obama critic Trent Franks , R-Ariz. , called for `` much tougher '' actions and said three times that Obama had `` finally found his tongue . ''\nMeanwhile , at Mar-a-Lago and on Fox News , various spokesmen for President-elect Trump said Obama 's real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks .\nThey spoke of Obama trying to `` tie Trump 's hands '' or `` box him in , '' meaning the president-elect would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow .\nThroughout 2016 , Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia , including cooperation in the fight against ISIS . Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country 's embattled dictator , Bashar Assad , bombing the besieged rebel-held city of Aleppo that fell to Assad 's forces this week .\nDuring the campaign , Trump even urged Russia to `` find '' missing emails from the private server of his opponent , Hillary Clinton . He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U.S. levels of support for NATO \u2014 Putin 's longtime nemesis . There have also been suggestions that Trump 's extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns .\nAll those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months . Sens . John McCain , R-Ariz. , and Lindsay Graham , R-S.C. , prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee , have accepted the assessment of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year .\nThat includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump . They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them , and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5 .\nBut the politicizing of the Russian actions \u2014 the idea that they helped Trump win \u2014 has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders . It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump 's legitimacy .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign . He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .\nTypically , Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised , and that is true . But it is also a red herring , as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U.S. intelligence agencies ' concern .\nFor his part , Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened . He has cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence reports to date and suggested `` no one really knows what happened .
