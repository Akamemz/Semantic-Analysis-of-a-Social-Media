Now we 're ending the pilot season with a visible twist \u2014 exploring the ways computers shape our behavior , and the way we see the world .\nThe first person we hear from is actually a cyborg . His name is Thad Starner . In 1993 , when Starner was in grad school , he went to see The Terminator . In the movie , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's character views the world through a screen that 's actually in his eyeball \u2014 sort of Google Glass before Google Glass came to be . Thad sees that and says , `` That is cool ! ''\nA whole bunch of psychologists are trying to systematically figure out how the rules of socializing work differently online . It 's almost as if the Internet is a different planet , where gravity pulls on us in a different way .\nSo he works with a friend to create a computer he can wear . He jury-rigs a little screen to some goggles so he literally has a screen sitting in front of one eye . He has a wearable keyboard for one hand . He 's constantly taking notes on everything around him , via the keyboard , so the computer is constantly tracking his interactions in the world .\nAnd then he programs the computer with something called a remembrance agent . It works like this \u2014 let 's say Starner runs into `` Kenji '' \u2014 somebody he only knows a little and has n't seen in four years . Starner types Kenji 's name on his keyboard , and the remembrance agent displays on the screen in front of his eye all the information about Kenji that Starner has ever entered into the system . It displays all that information \u2014 as Starner 's talking to the guy .\nWhat Starner found was that having all that information available to him changed him in certain ways \u2014 particularly his social relationships .\nWith easy access to that background information , for example , he 'd be able to say stuff like , `` Yes , Kenji , I know that last time we talked , your daughter was going to college . How 's she doing ? What 's she majoring in ? '' Without the computer 's help , Starner says , he would n't have had those details at the tip of his tongue \u2014 he would n't even have remembered that Kenji has a daughter .\nStarner says being able to insert those sorts of details into his conversation changed the way people responded to him \u2014 because it conveyed that he cared . `` Suddenly , '' he says , `` you 're interested in them . ''\nThese sorts of situations raise intriguing questions \u2014 maybe , in this case , it 's really the machine that 's interested in them .\nFor his part , Starner says he does n't think relying on the computer in this way cheapened his social interactions . He thinks it deepened them \u2014 made him almost superhuman .\nSo in this episode , we look a little deeper into the negative side of how computers are changing us .\nFor example , we talk to this guy named Pete Malachowsky . He started out as somebody sort of like Mr. Rogers \u2014 from Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood on TV . One thing that famously bothered Mr. Rogers \u2014 and Malachowsky , at least in the beginning \u2014 was `` seeing one person demeaning another . ''\nMalachowsky tells us that what really breaks his heart are the daily , minuscule cruelties we all see every day \u2014 on subways and buses when , say , a pregnant woman climbs aboard .\n`` You 'd think everybody would jump up to give her their seat , right ? '' says Malachowsky . `` But it does n't happen . It really does n't happen . '' Most passengers , he notices in his subway commute in New York , just keep their heads down , and pretend not to see the pregnant woman standing there .\nSo Pete set out to right these wrongs by setting up a Twitter account to document this rude behavior \u2014 calling people out on social media . In the beginning , he sort of saw it as a way to restore the moral balance .\nBut Pete says what really happened , over time , is that he ended up becoming the sort of person he hated \u2014 his own tweets started to get really , really harsh .\nAnd so we set out to understand in this episode whether there might be something about interacting with a computer \u2014 about being online \u2014 that could be behind this kind of transformation . And if so , how would that work ?\nWhat we found out is that there are a whole bunch of psychologists trying to systematically figure out how the rules of socializing work differently online . It 's almost as if the Internet is a different planet , where gravity pulls on us in a different way .\nOne really quick example of that is the idea of validation \u2014 the feeling you get when you rant to a friend about something that 's really bothering you , and then he says , `` You know , you 're right ! ''\nThat is almost like a tonic . It cools your overheated system . And the Internet , it turns out , is really good at giving you that feeling . Suddenly you can get validation \u2014 not from just one person , but from 30 ... or from thousands .\nThe potency of that is new . And , like any sort of drug , people will do all sorts of things to get it \u2014 it can become highly addictive .
