    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Hurricane Matthew is now bearing down on the Florida coast . The tropical storm \u2019 s wind gusts of 107 miles per hour and torrential downpours have already knocked out power for 300,000 people in Florida . Meteorologists are warning of devastating storm surges . One wave 17 feet high has already been spotted off the coast near Cape Canaveral . President Obama has declared a state of emergency for Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . Florida Governor Rick Scott has activated the 3,500 members of the state \u2019 s National Guard . Scott also urged residents living in mandatory evacuation zones to flee , warning , quote , \u201c This storm will kill you , \u201d unquote .\nAMY GOODMAN : More than 3 million people in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina are under evacuation orders .\nTo discuss how the role of climate change has been largely ignored in media coverage of Hurricane Matthew , we \u2019 re joined now in our New York studio by May Boeve , executive director of 350 Action , the political arm of the climate organization 350.org .\nMay , it \u2019 s great to have you with us . We so often see the words \u201c extreme weather \u201d and \u201c severe weather \u201d flashing in the lower thirds of the TV screens . Where are the words \u201c climate change \u201d and \u201c global warming \u201d ?\nMAY BOEVE : You \u2019 re exactly right . And Hurricane Matthew is , unfortunately , just the latest example of a trend where the impacts of climate change get more serious , politicians continue to have a break and say not nearly enough about it .\nWe have unequivocal reason to know that these kinds of storms are made worse by climate change . Particularly when we look at the amount of storm surge , Hurricane Matthew is coming into these coast on seas that are almost a foot higher because of sea level rise linked to climate change . Climate change brings more rainfall and threatens further flooding . So , without a doubt , we know we can make these connections . The science is clear .\nAnd we \u2019 re seeing a deafening climate silence from journalists and in this presidential cycle , where there have been no questions asked in the debates about this issue . And even today , we saw an op-ed from Paul Krugman suggesting that if this weekend in the debates there is not a question about climate change , he said it is almost criminally irresponsible .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Well , in the vice-presidential debates , there were no questions , but Mike Pence\u2014I don \u2019 t know how many times he kept talking about the war on coal that he believed Hillary Clinton was involved in , and yet even then the journalist didn \u2019 t take it up .\nMAY BOEVE : Well , that \u2019 s exactly right . And we know who is responsible for this problem . That \u2019 s why the climate silence is such a serious issue and something we have to confront , because it \u2019 s not like we don \u2019 t know why this is happening and we don \u2019 t have a solution . In fact , the opposite is true . We know that the fossil fuel industry benefits when climate change is not discussed , because these storms scare people . They alarm the public , and people want to see leadership . And when there \u2019 s no discussion of the issue , it leaves the fossil fuel industry players , like Exxon , without any real focus on their activities . We know what needs to happen to reduce the threat of climate change , and it \u2019 s leaving fossil fuels in the ground . And so , these moments are times when we need to talk about just how serious this problem is .\nThe devastation in Haiti is incredible , and it is a reminder to us , just as Edwidge said , that the poorest and most vulnerable are always affected first by these problems . And so the climate silence in that context is even more devastating .\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Clinton . The moderator , Lester Holt , did not ask about climate change , but it came up once during the brief exchange .\nHILLARY CLINTON : Take clean energy . Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century . Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese . I think it \u2019 s real .\nHILLARY CLINTON : \u2014that we grip this and deal with it , both at home and abroad .\nAMY GOODMAN : Last year , Donald Trump appeared on The Hugh Hewitt Show and was asked about global warming .\nHUGH HEWITT : Do you believe that the temperature of the Earth is increasing ? And what would you do , if you do believe that , vis-\u00e0-vis global climate change ?\nDONALD TRUMP : Well , first of all , I \u2019 m not a believer in global warming . I \u2019 m not a believer in man-made global warming . It could be warming , and it \u2019 s going to start to cool at some point . And , you know , in the early\u2014in the 1920s , people talked about global cooling . I don \u2019 t know if you know that or not . They thought the Earth was cooling . Now it \u2019 s global warming . And actually , we \u2019 ve had times where the weather wasn \u2019 t working out , so they changed it to \u201c extreme weather , \u201d and they have all different names , you know , so that it fits the bill .\nAMY GOODMAN : And in December , Donald Trump was asked a similar question by Bill O \u2019 Reilly on Fox .\nBILL O \u2019 REILLY : Do you believe in global warming , climate change ? Do you think the world \u2019 s going to change for the worse because it \u2019 s getting warmer ?\nDONALD TRUMP : I think that there \u2019 ll be little change here . It \u2019 ll go up , it \u2019 ll get a little cooler , it \u2019 ll get a little warmer , like it always has for millions of years . It \u2019 ll get cooler , it \u2019 ll get warmer . It \u2019 s called weather . I do believe in clean\u2014and I \u2019 ve received\u2014a lot of people don \u2019 t know this : I \u2019 ve received many environmental awards , many , many environmental awards , for the work I do . And I believe strongly in clean water and clean air . But I don \u2019 t believe that what they say\u2014I think it \u2019 s a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money .\nAMY GOODMAN : And in 2012 , Donald Trump tweeted : \u201c The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive , \u201d he said . Well , yesterday , we reported on Greenpeace revealing Donald Trump has multiple financial ties to the $ 3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline , which has faced months of resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota , as well as members of hundreds of tribes across the U.S. , Canada and Latin America . One of Trump \u2019 s financial disclosure forms shows he has between $ 500,000 and a million dollars invested in Energy Transfer Partners , the main company behind the Dakota Access pipeline . Trump also has $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 invested in Phillips 66 , which is slated to own 25 percent of the pipeline , if it \u2019 s completed . What about Donald Trump \u2019 s climate denialism ? We \u2019 ll see what happens on Sunday , if he even has to raise it , if he \u2019 s even asked .\nMAY BOEVE : Well , we might consider calling Hurricane Matthew \u201c Hurricane Donald. \u201d There \u2019 s a start , actually linking that climate denial helps lead to inaction , and therefore more problems . But debate moderators have not asked Donald Trump during the primary a single question about climate , so he has been left relatively off the hook on this issue , so we have to hear from him . And if people listening want to get involved , you can Google open questions , open debates , and vote for a climate question . Right now it \u2019 s ranked sixth in the order . And I think this weekend we have to hear . If the TV networks don \u2019 t start making these links between climate change and extreme weather events , they will be one of the last bastions of climate denial . And that has to change .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : I want to ask you\u2014Trump has vowed to undo the Paris climate accords if he becomes president . Can he ? Or what could he do to sabotage the accord , if he did becomes president ?\nMAY BOEVE : Well , as we know , it only entered into effect a few days ago . So , there \u2019 s a lot of concern about what would happen if he were elected president , given what he has said . I think we have some mechanisms to stop that , but the most important thing is we have to stop that outcome from happening . Donald Trump in the White House is a disaster for the climate . It can not be overstated .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , let \u2019 s talk about Hillary Clinton for a moment , in her own words , on fracking , from March , during a debate with Bernie Sanders .\nHILLARY CLINTON : You know , I don \u2019 t support it when any locality or any state is against it , number one . I don \u2019 t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present . I don \u2019 t support it , number three , unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using . So by the time we get through all of my conditions , I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place . And I think that \u2019 s the best approach , because right now there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated . So , first , we \u2019 ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway , and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met .\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS : My answer\u2014my answer is a lot shorter : No , I do not support fracking .\nAMY GOODMAN : That was a town hall with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton that was moderated by Anderson Cooper , who will be the moderator of the town hall in St. Louis on Sunday . And by the way , \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! will be broadcasting the whole town hall debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , but we will expand the debate . After each question is put to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , we will put the same question to Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein , breaking the sound barrier . We \u2019 ll also have a roundtable discussion . That is 8:00 Eastern [ Daylight ] Time to 11:30 on Sunday night . But let me ask you that question about fracking and Hillary Clinton .\nMAY BOEVE : We know that to prevent the worst effects of climate change , there can be no fracking . In fact , a new report that just came out from Oil Change International makes it abundantly clear : no more pipelines , no more mines , no more fracking . So , there is no question that we are going to push whoever is elected on this issue .\nAMY GOODMAN : And DAPL , the Dakota Access pipeline . In the midst of this debate , we see lockdown after lockdown . Now , the sheriff of North Dakota , in the area where the encampments are of thousands of people , is calling in law enforcement , possibly from other states .\nMAY BOEVE : This is a fight of historic proportion . And I want to thank you , in particular , for highlighting it . I think what we \u2019 re seeing on the ground in the Dakotas is a sign that the movement to keep fossil fuels in the ground is stronger all the time . Moreover , the story of the historic unity among these tribes has inspired people all around the world . We \u2019 re going to continue to support their fight as much as we can , and we hope everyone listening will do everything they can , as well .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : And one quick question about fracking . There \u2019 s big\u2014there are obviously big battles here in the United States , but what \u2019 s happening abroad in terms of fracking , which is\u2014\nMAY BOEVE : Too much . They \u2019 re starting to frack in the Amazon . But the good news is 180 municipalities have banned fracking in Brazil . There \u2019 s fracking throughout Europe , and there \u2019 s fracking in North Africa . And for the next climate conference of the U.N. , happening in Morocco later this month , fracking will be a major issue we \u2019 ll be profiling there , as well . So , there \u2019 s a lot of investment in fracking . Of course , you can see Exxon \u2019 s footprints all over that . But equally impressive are the groups that are standing up to fight fracking , just like they have in New York , where a moratorium was declared .\nAMY GOODMAN : And \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! will be in Marrakech for the U.N. climate summit . It starts the week of the election and then goes for another week . May Boeve , thanks so much for being with us , executive director of 350 Action , the political arm of the climate organization 350.org .\nWhen we come back from break , a cold case is solved , a serial killer of women . The solution started with a tip from a woman who was listening to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! when she made a call to a Mississippi reporter . Stay with us .",
