Since then , the GOP presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to Hillary Clinton \u2014 and is only poised to launch a limited , less-targeted ad campaign in the days before next week \u2019 s debate .\nWhile his campaign announced a new ad on Tuesday , it \u2019 s only going to run on national cable news stations and during two Sunday morning public-affairs shows , according to data from The Tracking Firm , a company that monitors media buys . And even with that seemingly modest buy \u2014 the full extent of which was n't clear on Wednesday night \u2014 Clinton is still outspending him this week many times over .\n\u201c It \u2019 s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again , off-again TV buy , \u201d said Elizabeth Wilner , a former TV-network political director who , until last month , monitored political advertising for Kantar Media/CMAG .\nThe strategy has perplexed political media buyers who aren \u2019 t affiliated with the campaign . Trump \u2019 s campaign is underfunded compared to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s \u2014 his campaign had only $ 50 million on hand as of Aug. 30 , according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday night \u2014 but Trump \u2019 s failure to advertise consistently threatens the efficacy of his entire paid media campaign , limited as it is .\nThe political media buyers , including Republicans who declined to be named in criticizing the nominee , warned that the effects of television ads are fleeting , and any benefit Trump might get from putting his paid advertisements in front of voters can be undone with time if those messages aren \u2019 t reinforced .\nThe GOP nominee \u2019 s absence is also compounding Clinton \u2019 s domination of the airwaves . Last week , Smart Media Group , a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee , wrote in a memo to the Trump campaign that through Sept. 12 , Trump had spent just $ 17 million on TV ads , compared to $ 126 million for Clinton . If outside group spending is counted , the disparity is even more stunning : $ 244 million for Clinton versus $ 33 million for Trump .\nThe highly unusual decision to go mostly dark in advance of the debate is emblematic of Trump \u2019 s approach to television advertising in the general election , a patchwork effort that has engaged in swing states only in fits and starts . Of the 20 days thus far in September , Trump has advertised in Florida , North Carolina and Pennsylvania for 11 days , and for 12 in Ohio . He \u2019 s also run one-week flights in a number of other states beginning over Labor Day weekend , only to let those expire more than a week ago and decline to rebook .\nA Trump campaign spokesman declined to reply to inquiries on Tuesday and Wednesday about the campaign \u2019 s strategy .\nClinton , meanwhile , is continuing to blanket eight states in ads .\nConfusion about Trump \u2019 s strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising \u2014 it \u2019 s the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising . When Trump first launched his TV ads in mid-August , they were focused on four core states : Florida , North Carolina , Ohio and Pennsylvania . Together , those states will award 82 electoral votes \u2014 and Trump will win the election if he carries those four and holds all the other states Mitt Romney won in 2012 .\nTrump went on the air in those states on August 19 , and he kept advertising in them through September 6 or 7 , depending on the state .\nWhile those ads were on the air , Trump expanded to six new states : Colorado , Iowa , Michigan , Nevada , New Hampshire and Virginia . Ads began in those states in early September and ran for roughly one week \u2013 including an eye-popping , $ 2.2-million buy in Virginia , where the Clinton campaign stopped advertising last month after pulling comfortably ahead in the polls .\nBut the Trump ads ended between September 7 and September 10 , depending on the state . Trump has been off the air in those places ever since .\nMeanwhile , he reengaged in his four core states \u2014 Florida , North Carolina , Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 on September 12 . ( Both campaigns abstained from airing ads on the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks . ) After nearly a week off the air in those four states most central to his candidacy , Trump last Monday rolled out a combined $ 2.5-million ad buy over five days . But those reservations ended last Friday .\nIn their place , Trump \u2019 s campaign is planning a limited ad campaign , buying time on four cable stations : Fox Business Network , Fox News Channel , MSNBC and CNBC . He \u2019 s also planning to run national ads during at least two of the national Sunday morning public affairs programs on broadcast TV : \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d and NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press . \u201d\nFor political purposes , it \u2019 s a relatively inefficient buy . The 11 states that make up \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Battleground States project hold roughly 29 percent of the population . That means , roughly speaking , that seven-in-10 Americans reached by a national ad buy live outside the battleground states .\nThe Clinton campaign , on the other hand , continues to advertise heavily in eight targeted states : Arizona , Florida , Iowa , North Carolina , New Hampshire , Nevada , Ohio and Pennsylvania , while also , at times , running national advertisements . ( The campaign \u2019 s investments in Arizona , which has voted Republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections , are much smaller than in the other states . )\nJust this week \u2014 from Tuesday through next Monday , the day of the first debate \u2014 Clinton is poised to spend nearly $ 6.8 million on TV ads , backed up by another $ 5.6 million from pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action in those states , minus Arizona .\nTrump \u2019 s air cover from outside groups is also far more limited than Clinton \u2019 s . Rebuilding America Now , a pro-Trump super PAC , is spending $ 635,000 in Pennsylvania this week .
