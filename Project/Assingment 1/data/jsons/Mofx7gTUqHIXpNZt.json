But there is one carryover from 2008 : To win the White House , Barack Obama will once again have to make history .\nFour years ago , it was a groundbreaking victory for the first African-American to win the presidency . Now , to win four more years , it is a less glamorous but still significant barrier in his way : only Franklin Roosevelt was re-elected with unemployment this high .\nBut while the historic statistical models would suggest defeat looms in November , the president arrives in Charlotte with several key advantages in the race , and with an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes and victory than his Republican rival .\n\u2022 Incumbency : Yes there are downsides to this , but the stage and powers of the presidency are on the whole an advantage , especially in a close , competitive race .\nJUST WATCHED Obama , Romney in dead heat in NC Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Obama : I try to be a hands-on dad 03:55\n\u2022 More room for error : Mitt Romney needs to win Florida and Ohio , and at least two of these three -- Virginia , North Carolina and Wisconsin -- to have a realistic shot at 270 . Obama , on the other hand , enters his convention with several paths to cobble 270 together .\n\u2022 Demographics : As long as the GOP has a crisis with Latino voters , there is a built-in Democratic edge in several key states . New Mexico , not long ago a presidential swing state , is barely mentioned as a potential GOP target . And Nevada is a competitive tossup despite the highest unemployment rate among the states and a punishing housing crisis .\nWhile his path to 270 has more room for error , it is very different from the lopsided Democratic advantage in 2008 .\nThen-Sen. Obama won three states that had n't voted Democratic for president in more than a generation -- Indiana , North Carolina and Virginia . His campaign already concedes Indiana is an almost-certain red state this year , and North Carolina and Virginia are tossups . So are Wisconsin , Iowa , Nevada and Colorado -- all states where the president 's margin was fairly comfortable four years ago .\nThe economy is of course the driving force behind the very different 2012 map and mood .\nThe unemployment rate in February 2009 -- Obama 's first full month is office -- was 8.3 % . Last month , it was 8.3 % .\nTo the Romney campaign , that is proof the president 's economic policies have failed . The Obama team , in turn , notes that unemployment hit 10 % in October 2009 , and argues that the president 's policies are , albeit slowly , helping pull the economy out of a deep recession he inherited .\nJUST WATCHED Cummings : U.S. is and will be better off Replay More Videos ...
