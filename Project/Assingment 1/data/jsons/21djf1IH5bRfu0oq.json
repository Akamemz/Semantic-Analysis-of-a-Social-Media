But more significantly , the contest here demonstrated that the Vermont senator has failed to make any headway at all with African-American voters in the South . Even with 200 paid Sanders staffers on the ground and nearly $ 2 million in television spending , Clinton swept the black vote by a 5-to-1 ratio , according to exit polls . Among black voters 65 and older , Clinton won by a stunning 96 percent to 3 percent .\n\u201c When we stand together , there is no barrier too big to break , \u201d Clinton said at her victory rally in Columbia , where , for the first time on a 2016 election night , she took the stage without Bill or Chelsea Clinton by her side . \u201c Tomorrow , we take this campaign national . \u201d\nNow , heading into Super Tuesday , when 11 states will cast ballots on March 1 , Sanders will face possibly insurmountable contests in Georgia , Tennessee , Alabama , Arkansas and Virginia , all states with sizable black populations in which he has not invested as much time or money .\n\u201c Delegates determine the presidential nomination , and I don \u2019 t see a path for Sanders to get there , \u201d said Jeff Berman , a consultant to the Clinton campaign who ran Barack Obama \u2019 s 2008 delegate strategy .\nRunning through a best-case scenario for Sanders , Clinton operatives said they expect Sanders could win Colorado , Minnesota , Massachusetts , Oklahoma and Vermont \u2014 states tailor-made for the democratic socialist because they hold caucuses , are predominantly white , located in New England or have a history of electing progressives .\nBut even if Sanders manages to pull out significant wins in all five , the delegate math will make it difficult for Sanders to catch up : They represent only one-third of the delegates up for grabs on Tuesday . And the Clinton campaign has invested heavily in states like Colorado and Minnesota in order to limit Sanders \u2019 margins .\nSanders \u2019 operatives said they are looking beyond Super Tuesday , to the friendlier terrain of Kansas , Nebraska and Maine to deliver them wins . But by then , Clinton operatives predicted , it could be too little , too late to close the delegate gap .\n\u201c Our delegate lead will only grow in the period after Super Tuesday , \u201d Berman said .\nSanders \u2019 situation is similar to one in which Clinton found herself eight years ago , when Barack Obama established a delegate lead during 11 consecutive victories after Super Tuesday and she was never able to catch up . In that race , Super Tuesday resulted in a colossal tie between Obama and Clinton .\nThis year , however , it \u2019 s on Super Tuesday that Clinton operatives expect to open up a lead of 50 delegates or more and leave Sanders behind for good .\n\u201c Super Tuesday in 2016 is not the same as in 2008 , when the Democratic candidates fought to a draw , \u201d said Berman . \u201c This year , it is much more Southern-dominated , heavily diverse with African-American voters in many states and Hispanic voters in Texas .

The next real battleground contest will take place on March 8 in Michigan , where Clinton has been making the toxic-water woes of Flint a centerpiece of her campaign .\nA win there would be symbolically important for Sanders , because of the outsize role Flint has played in Clinton \u2019 s campaign . But Clinton operatives noted that Mississippi , which votes on the same day and where Clinton is expected to win , would allow them to win more delegates even if Sanders takes Michigan .\nSanders \u2019 campaign expects that the Vermonter \u2019 s personal story \u2014 he is the son of Polish immigrants \u2014 will resonate more deeply with Latino voters .
