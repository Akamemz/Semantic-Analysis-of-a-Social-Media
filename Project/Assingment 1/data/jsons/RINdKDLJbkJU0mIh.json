But that \u2019 s because the media are running the debate\u2014and the media \u2019 s chief goal , he believes , is to create a \u201c nation of morons. \u201d It \u2019 s not exactly a new complaint of his . In fact , his complaints about the media predate the birth of most of the reporters who \u2019 ll be covering the Las Vegas bout .\nSanders possesses \u201c the consistency of a piston , \u201d as my colleague Michael Kruse recently put it . In his four decades of politicking , Sanders has remained faithful to his original views on labor , Wall Street and the banks , poverty , socialism , education , the environment , women \u2019 s rights , income disparities , foreign policy and the woes of the middle class .\nNor have Sanders \u2019 ideas about media\u2014especially what he calls the \u201c corporate media \u201d \u2014wavered since he entered Vermont politics in the 1970s . In his view , the media tend to trivialize the important issues if they cover them at all . They want to cover campaign fights , not campaign debates . They over-rely on entertaining soundbites . Their news agenda is about generating profits , not producing quality journalism that will \u201c educate \u201d the voters . And as powerful as the corporate media are , they seek even more concentrated power through acquisition and consolidation .\nPoliticians have been tying the press to the whipping post for centuries , so Sanders hasn \u2019 t discovered anything new . In this campaign cycle , hardly a day goes by without Donald Trump calling reporters \u201c clowns \u201d or \u201c dishonest , \u201d sometimes singling out by name those he considers the worst offenders . Hillary Clinton 's disdain for the \u201c scorps \u201d in the press is legendary . When not playing duck and run , she marginalizes press inquiries with dismissive or evasive answers or by calling the questions \u201c distractions. \u201d But no presidential contender in memory has confronted the media quite the way Sanders has\u2014and no candidate \u2019 s media criticism is as central to his or her core beliefs as Sanders \u2019 complaints . He calls into question not only the product but also the capitalist structure upon which Big Media subsists .\nSanders never shrinks from speaking what he considers to be truth to media power . During an August campaign swing through Iowa , Sanders once again confronted reporters over the content of his questions , coming across as a press critic .\n\u201c The corporate media talks about all kinds of issues except the more important issues , \u201d Sanders said , hitting the trivialization check-box . \u201c And time after time , I \u2019 m being asked to criticize Hillary Clinton . That \u2019 s the sport that you guys like , \u201d he continued .\nAs one press critic to another , I can inform Sanders that asking a politician to criticize another politician \u2019 s views or actions is not necessarily \u201c sport. \u201d The conflict he seeks to avoid helps voters decide which candidate better represents their views and interests . But I know Sanders is too dug in on this point to ever surrender . The public , he continued in his hallway reprimand , had tired of \u201c gotcha questions \u201d from the press and the effort of reporters to \u201c make conflict between the candidates rather than talking about the real issues impacting the American people. \u201d And with this flourish , he filled the confrontation and entertainment check-boxes to overflowing .\nThe media have never been Sanders \u2019 highest priority\u2014they do n't , for instance , rate a mention on his Bernie for president issue page . But the topic has never been far from his lips at any time during his career . Sometimes he criticizes the press , as in the Iowa example , to fend off questions he thinks are beneath him , that don \u2019 t advance his campaign or that he regards as too personal . In a perfectly Sandersian world , he \u2019 d be allowed to both ask and answer all the questions . Other times , the Sanders media critique verges into Noam Chomsky territory , denouncing the press for adhering to its corporatist agenda .\nSanders expressed his early views\u2014largely unchanged to this day\u2014on media in a 1979 piece for Vermont \u2019 s Vanguard Press , \u201c Social Control and the Tube. \u201d The goal of the corporate TV masters was to \u201c intentionally brainwash people into submission and helplessness , \u201d making them easier marks for salesmen of \u201c underarm spray deodorants , automobiles , beer , cat food , politicians or whatever. \u201d ( The deodorant menace is a recurrent Sanders theme , too . ) Sanders continued :\n`` With considerable forethought [ TV capitalists ] are attempting to create a nation of morons who will faithfully go out and buy this or that product , vote for this or that candidate , and faithfully work for their employers for as low a wage as possible . ''\nAsserting that the \u201c controllers of that medium have far more power than almost any politician , \u201d Sanders called for a \u201c democratically owned and controlled \u201d TV system populated with \u201c dozens of channels of commercial-free \u201d broadcasting to replace the existing order . I \u2019 m sure that Sanders finds little consolation in the fact that half of his wish came true : Dozens of commercial-free channels such as the Disney Channel , HDNET , porn channels , the various flavors of HBO , Starz and Showtime and more have been established since his Vanguard Press manifesto .
