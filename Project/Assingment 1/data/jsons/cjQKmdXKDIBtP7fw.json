    "content": "Democratic lawmakers have joined with Republicans in raising alarm about a looming ObamaCare-tied tax on medical devices , saying the additional tax is causing `` uncertainty and confusion for businesses '' and should be delayed .\nThe previously obscure tax has , over the last several months , emerged as one of the most controversial in the health care overhaul and one of the few with bipartisan opposition . Starting Jan. 1 , the Affordable Care Act imposes a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices with the goal of raising nearly $ 30 billion over the next decade .\nBut a group of U.S. senators this week revived concerns that the tax could hurt one of the few U.S. industries `` that enjoys a net trade surplus . ''\n`` The medical technology industry directly employs over 400,000 people in the United States and is responsible for a total of 2 million high-skilled manufacturing jobs , '' Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan wrote in a letter with 16 other senators and senators-elect Monday to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid . `` In an environment focused on increasing exports , promoting small businesses and growing high-tech manufacturing jobs for the future , we must do all we can to ensure that our country maintains its global leadership position in the medical technology industry and keeps good jobs here at home . ''\nThe lawmakers urged Reid to support a delay in implementation , warning of the business consequences .\n`` With this year quickly drawing to a close , the medical device industry has received little guidance about how to comply with the tax-causing significant uncertainty and confusion for businesses , '' they wrote . `` As we work together to develop a long-term solution to help move our economy forward , reduce our debt and reform our tax code , we urge you to support delaying enactment of this provision in a fiscally responsible manner . ''\nIt 's unclear whether any changes to the planned tax could be included as part of a broader deal to avert the looming fiscal crisis . The Republican-controlled House over the summer already voted to repeal the tax , but the Senate never took it up .\nLast week , Republican Georgia Rep. Tom Price reiterated his call for the tax to be stripped , saying doing so `` is a place where Republicans and Democrats alike can find common ground in efforts to serve the American people . ''\nStephen J.
