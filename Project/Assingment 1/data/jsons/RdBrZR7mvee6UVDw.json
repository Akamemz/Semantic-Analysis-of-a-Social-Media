    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 In November 2013 , Jeb Bush took to the rostrum at New York \u2019 s Marriott Marquis for the annual meeting of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , alongside such industry stars as Goldman Sachs \u2019 Lloyd Blankfein and Blackrock \u2019 s Larry Fink . Bush \u2019 s remarks , and his chatting afterwards , left many attendees convinced he was preparing to run for president . Word of Bush \u2019 s interest ricocheted around the political world .\nBut Bush , a private citizen for eight years since leaving the Florida governor \u2019 s mansion , had no real infrastructure to handle such an endeavor . And as the third member of a storied political family to seek the presidency , just five years after his brother left office with near record-low approval ratings , he had no clear message or answer to the inevitable questions about why he was the right man for 2016 . \u201c He just got way out there beyond his capacity to manage and he consciously decided to take his profile down while thinking through how to make a run , \u201d one friend said .\nSo while even close Bush watchers began to doubt whether he was really serious about running , he and a close-knit group of advisers were following a careful plan aimed at maximizing his chances of winning the nomination , if and when he gave the thumbs-up .\nTheir strategy was to publicly downplay his interest in the race and avoid media attention , while quietly laying the groundwork for a launch that would catch much of Washington \u2014 and many of his potential rivals \u2014 flat-footed . While the much of the political world focused on Chris Christie , Rand Paul and even Bush \u2019 s fellow Floridian Marco Rubio , Bush was quietly collecting political chits , developing a cohesive platform , and preparing for a fundraising blitz intended to grab the front-runner \u2019 s chair , scare potential competitors like Mitt Romney and Christie , and put Bush on such a firm financial footing that he could devote more time to retail politics when it really counted .\nBush \u2019 s first step , after that November date at the Marriott Marquis , was to hire full-time help . Within a month , he had dipped into his personal fortune to hire four staffers : longtime adviser and former chief of staff Sally Bradshaw , former spokeswoman Kristy Campbell , longtime aide Brandi Brown and political aide Josh Venable . Bush \u2019 s political consultant , Mike Murphy , joined in conference calls from his California home .\nBradshaw describes the following year as a \u201c process \u201d in which staffers carefully set up the building blocks for a massive campaign , while the would-be candidate engaged in his own soul-searching under the radar screen . Even unscripted moments like his mother \u2019 s declaration in January 2014 that she hoped he wouldn \u2019 t run helped serve his purposes \u2014 allowing the family to acknowledge the audacity of a third Bush presidency while masking Bush \u2019 s preparations .\n\u201c We just do what people who work for Jeb Bush always do , which is build the plan , execute the plan and don \u2019 t talk about it , \u201d Bradshaw said .\nIn keeping with that line , Bradshaw didn \u2019 t provide the specifics of the \u201c plan , \u201d although she indicated it was more a series of dos and don \u2019 ts for 2014 .\nDo : Travel , fund-raise for other candidates , quietly vet Bush \u2019 s business dealings and other potential points of attack , and entertain calls from supporters to run .\nDon \u2019 t : Establish a political committee , travel to first-in-the-nation Iowa or explicitly start lining up donors or more staffers until year \u2019 s end .\n\u201c Donors called me all the time . I didn \u2019 t go to donors and solicit their support , \u201d Bradshaw said . \u201c If a donor called and said \u2018 Is Jeb Bush running ? \u2019 I would say \u2018 I don \u2019 t know . He \u2019 s going through a process of thinking very seriously about this . What do you think he should do ? \u2019 \u201d\nIf the donor responded , \u201c Well , I think he should run , \u201d Bradshaw said she \u2019 d reply : \u201c Let \u2019 s get all of your contact information . \u201d\nBradshaw added that she had no idea what Bush \u2019 s ultimate decision would be , but she collected donor information as a safeguard in case Bush took the next step .\nBush \u2019 s announcement that he was seriously considering a run was , as it turned out , exquisitely timed \u2014 just after Thanksgiving of last year .\n\u201c Jeb \u2019 s pace surprised a lot of us , \u201d said Scott Reed , the former campaign manager for Bob Dole \u2019 s 1996 presidential campaign and a longtime GOP operative who is neutral in this race . \u201c He dominated the holiday season \u2019 s headlines while everybody else was wrapping presents . \u201d\nAt that moment , Bush \u2019 s team hit the phones and emails with what some have called a \u201c shock and awe \u201d campaign that could raise between $ 50 million and $ 100 million by the end of the first quarter of the year .\n\u201c All that matters in this first quarter is fundraising , \u201d said Reed . \u201c Nobody else has done what he has done . \u201d\nIndeed , by the end of the quarter , Bush \u2019 s team believes , many would-be competitors will have joined Romney on the sidelines , unwilling or unable to compete with the Bush juggernaut , while the candidate can be freed up to address the many serious questions about why another Bush is the best solution to the nation \u2019 s problems .\nThe confidence with which Bush is pursuing his strategy was evident last Wednesday in the Picasso-adorned Park Avenue home of private-equity titan Henry Kravis . It was Bush \u2019 s 62nd birthday , and he celebrated in Kravis \u2019 26-room penthouse with more than 40 of the richest people in New York . Among them were Bush \u2019 s cousin , George Walker IV , the chief executive of the investment management firm of Neuberger Berman , and real estate mogul Jerry Speyer , along with Ken Mehlman and Alex Navab of Kravis \u2019 firm , KKR . The admission price : a minimum of $ 100,000 , also the going rate for other Bush fundraisers .\nGuests took an elevator straight to the foyer and noshed on salmon and other hors d \u2019 oeuvres while listening to Bush talk about strategy for the upcoming campaign .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t get the big job by tearing other people down and you don \u2019 t get it by trying to appeal to everyone , \u201d a donor recalled Bush saying . \u201c I \u2019 m going to play this thing my way and let the chips fall where they may . \u201d\nThe donors understood , as Bush does , that he needs their sizable help to offset his shaky support from some of the party \u2019 s conservative activist base , miffed over his positions on immigration and the Common Core educational standards . The money he collected would pay for time later in the campaign that he could devote to grassroots campaigning .\nAs it turns out , Kravis \u2019 $ 4 million haul has led to a donor arms race with Coral Gables billionaire Miguel \u201c Mike \u201d Fernandez , who wrote in an email obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he intends to raise $ 5 million at a fundraiser next week at his waterfront mansion . About $ 1 million of that haul would come from Fernandez himself .",
