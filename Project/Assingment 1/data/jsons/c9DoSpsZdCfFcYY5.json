Bollocks to Brexit. \u201d Singing : \u201c Jingle bells , Brexit smells. \u201d \u201c Ho , ho , ho , ho , ho. \u201d Expressive crowds gather outside Parliament to demand that the government should , quite simply \u2014 \u201c Stop Brexit now ! \u201d Contrast that to an earlier rally , also with a clear , but totally different message \u2014 \u201c Brexit now . Brexit now. \u201d We spoke with people on each side , and they are deeply divided . \u201c What do we want ? \u201d \u201c Brexit. \u201d \u201c What do we want ? \u201d \u201c A people \u2019 s vote. \u201d Except that all of them are losing their faith in the system . \u201c The British people deserve better than Brexit. \u201d Crowd : \u201c Yes. \u201d \u201c When the British people speak , their voice will be respected , not ignored . If we vote to leave , then we will leave. \u201d In 2016 , the country held a referendum . Voters were given a choice : to either leave or remain in the European Union . The leave side said it was a vote to \u2014 \u201c Take back control of this democracy. \u201d And when the votes were tallied \u2014 \u201c The U.K. has voted to leave the European Union. \u201d \u201c We \u2019 ve got our country back. \u201d [ cheering ] \u201c There can be no turning back. \u201d Fast forward through two and a half years of negotiations with the E.U . over the terms of the breakup . Three weeks ago , Prime Minister Theresa May finally brought home a deal to present to Parliament . \u201c This is the best possible deal . It \u2019 s the only possible deal. \u201d But it \u2019 s a very unpopular one . \u201c Statement , the prime minister. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve listened very carefully to what has been said in this chamber , and out of it. \u201d [ jeering ] \u201c Mr . Speaker , this is a bad deal for Britain , a bad deal for our economy , and a bad deal for our democracy. \u201d But beyond the political debates , livelihoods are at stake . The Bank of England announced that Brexit could shrink the economy , and be as bad as the 2008 financial crisis . A world away from London , in many of the regions where factories have closed or where jobs have trickled away , the \u201c leave \u201d arguments dominate . Like in Blackpool , a seaside resort town that has seen better days . It was once a favorite holiday destination for many British people , but it \u2019 s now just as cheap to fly away to sunny Spain . With fewer tourists , Blackpool is suffering . Life expectancy for men here is the shortest in England . And people take more anti-depressants per person than anywhere else in the country . 67 percent voted for Brexit . \u201c We voted to leave the E.U . And now , we \u2019 re being ignored. \u201d Paul was born here , and he \u2019 s seen the town change profoundly in his lifetime . \u201c It \u2019 s almost as though life doesn \u2019 t have the structures it used to have . And people just feel the opportunities aren \u2019 t there anymore . And the economic system isn \u2019 t fair. \u201d \u201c Is there a feeling that being part of the E.U . is directly responsible for some of that ? \u201d \u201c Yes , because we were contributing 10 billion pounds a year , which is quite a lot of money. \u201d Paul is talking about a membership fee that the U.K. pays to be a part of the E.U . \u201c Where is the money going ? What are they doing with it ? \u201d The answer ? It \u2019 s complicated . Benefits sometimes come back home in indirect ways . Take Liverpool , 60 miles south . In 2008 , the E.U . named it European Capital of Culture . That brought in millions of visitors , who brought in millions of pounds . \u201c The city has just transformed itself . And I think because of that , that opportunity within the city is much greater . I think it inspires people to become something that they want to become. \u201d Poppy , like the majority of young people , voted against Brexit . Now , she \u2019 s joined a new movement that \u2019 s pushing for a second referendum , with an option to remain in the E.U . They call it a \u201c people \u2019 s vote. \u201d This effort is hard to miss , even in regions that voted heavily for Brexit . Like here , in County Durham , in the northeast of England . \u201c Richard , and then Jamie. \u201d \u201c People have every right to change their minds when presented with fresh facts , with new evidence and with a greater sense of certainty about what Brexit means. \u201d \u201c The people voted for Brexit because they are disenfranchised as a whole . The political system is broken. \u201d \u201c My personal view is that we now know what Brexit looks like .
