We have had a successful working relationship with A & E but , as a family , we can not imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm , \u201d the Robertsons wrote on their website , duckcommander.com .\n\u201c We are in discussions with A & E to see what that means for the future of \u2018 Duck Dynasty. \u2019 Again , thank you for your continued support of our family , \u201d they concluded .\nSEE ALSO : \u2018 Duck Dynasty \u2019 star Phil Robertson \u2019 s pre-A & E same as post-A & E : Homosexuality is a sin\nSome Republican politicians , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal , spoke in defense of Mr. Robertson , and traditional values groups added their voices to the cultural moment .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t apologize for what the Bible calls a sin . HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY to stand with Phil , \u201d said one Facebook poster , using one of Mr. Robertson \u2019 s pet phrases .\nSadly , being \u201c happy \u201d was not how Mr. Robertson answered a GQ magazine reporter \u2019 s question about \u201c what , in your mind , is sinful ? \u201d\n\u201c Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there . Bestiality , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men , \u201d Mr. Robertson replied in the GQ article , released Wednesday .\nThen , paraphrasing Paul \u2019 s First Letter to the Corinthians on sin , Mr. Robertson said , \u201c Don \u2019 t be deceived . Neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers \u2014 they won \u2019 t inherit the kingdom of God . Don \u2019 t deceive yourself . It \u2019 s not right . \u201d\nThese and other comments about being \u201c white trash \u201d hoeing cotton with black farmhands and not recalling black people \u201c singing the blues \u201d until after major welfare programs were established in the 1960s , earned Mr. Robertson an indefinite suspension from the reality TV show that stars him and his family \u2014 and attracts nearly 12 million viewers .\n\u201c We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson \u2019 s comments in GQ , which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty , \u201d A & E executives said in a statement Wednesday . \u201c His personal views in no way reflect those of A & E Networks , who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community . The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely . \u201d\nMr. Robertson also issued a statement , referencing his sinful past and how his \u201c mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches , and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together . \u201d\n\u201c However , I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me . We are all created by the Almighty and like Him , I love all of humanity . We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other , \u201d Mr. Robertson said .\nThe Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation thanked A & E Network for suspending the 67-year-old , gray-bearded patriarch .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c clear that such hateful anti-gay comments are unacceptable to fans , viewers and networks alike , \u201d said GLAAD spokesman Wilson Cruz . Putting Mr. Robertson on hiatus \u201c sent a strong message that discrimination is neither a Christian nor an American value . \u201d\nIn their letter to A & E President and CEO Nancy Dubuc , leaders of the Human Rights Campaign and NAACP asked her to denounce and repudiate Mr. Robertson \u2019 s \u201c racist and homophobic remarks . \u201d\nGay-rights supporters took their outrage about Mr. Robertson \u2019 s \u201c vile \u201d remarks to social media . Many shared a 2010 \u201c gay-bashing \u201d video of Mr. Robertson , posted by TMZ , in which he lamented \u201c women with women , men with men . \u201d\nBut on Thursday , Robertson supporters were answering back in droves .\n\u201c If you believe in free speech or religious liberty , you should be deeply dismayed over the treatment of Phil Robertson . Phil expressed his personal views and his own religious faith ; for that , he was suspended from his job , \u201d Mr. Cruz , Texas Republican , wrote on his Facebook page .\nThe \u201c mainstream media should not behave as the thought police censoring the views with which they disagree , \u201d the senator said . \u201c The reason that so many Americans love Duck Dynasty is because it represents the America usually ignored or mocked by liberal elites : a family that loves and cares for each other , believes in God , and speaks openly about their faith . \u201d\nMr. Jindal , who praised Mr. Robertson and his family as \u201c great citizens of the State of Louisiana , \u201d noted that \u201c the politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints , except those they disagree with . \u201d\nHe noted the cultural double standards surrounding public misbehavior , saying \u201c it is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh , and Phil Robertson gets suspended . \u201d\nMrs. Palin also weighed in on her Facebook page : \u201c Free speech is an endangered species . Those \u2018 intolerants \u2019 hatin \u2019 and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us . \u201d\nEven GLAAD \u2019 s Facebook page was filled with comments supporting Phil Robertson . \u201c I have never said a negative word about your community , but , that changes today ! \u201d wrote one man . \u201c GLAAD I thought you guys stood against Bullying .
