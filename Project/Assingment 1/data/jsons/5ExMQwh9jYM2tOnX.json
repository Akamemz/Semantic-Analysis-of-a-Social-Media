    "content": "The ongoing fight between the Republican establishment and the Tea Party is turning into a downward spiral of vengeance that would leave any Greek tragedian impressed . After blowing their chance at taking the Senate in 2010 , the establishment punched back at the Tea Party and moved to keep the kooks from winning primaries in 2014 . The Tea Party , seeing its candidates go down , had its own \u201c revenge \u201d by booting out establishment Republicans in Texas and turning the state party into the Tea Party \u2019 s very own ideological sandbox . And now the establishment , having dealt with the foot soldiers , is planning to exact retribution on the very avatar of the Tea Party ethos : Ted Cruz .\nTime \u2019 s Jay Newton-Small reports that Republicans , with primary season largely behind them , are plotting to take revenge on Cruz for the outsize role he \u2019 s played in destroying the Republican brand over the last 17 months . Their swift and brutal retribution will come in the form of stripping his committee assignments and cutting him off from big donors . Doing so would be a just and fitting punishment for a senator who \u2019 s caused no small amount of trouble for his own party . It would also be completely stupid .\nThe truth about the Republicans \u2019 \u201c Ted Cruz problem \u201d is that the \u201c problem , \u201d such as it exists , is their own damn fault . If one were asked to single out the single most damaging action Cruz has inflicted upon the GOP , the easy answer is the Obamacare-inspired government shutdown , for which Cruz was the chief proponent and agitator . Everyone recalls his ridiculous \u201c filibuster \u201d against the Senate bill to fund government operations ( and Obamacare ) , and while his hours of speech-making got a lot of attention , it did nothing to actually prevent the Senate from passing the bill . The impasse came when the House Republican leadership threw in with Cruz and stripped funding for Obamacare from their own version of the legislation . They , like Cruz , felt there was political benefit in forcing the issue and a chance they could get the White House to back down .\nPut plainly , Cruz wouldn \u2019 t have had the influence he did if his ideas weren \u2019 t shared by so many on the Republican side of the aisle . Punishing Cruz for the shutdown is also an indictment of John Boehner and Eric Cantor and every other Republican who actually made it possible . At the most basic level , Cruz is a senator because he represents ideas the Republican base finds very appealing . Time \u2019 s article mentions February \u2019 s debt ceiling fight , in which Cruz imposed a 60-vote supermajority to pass any increase , as one of the \u201c uncomfortable votes \u201d he \u2019 s forced his colleagues to take . That vote was \u201c uncomfortable \u201d for them because Republican voters really don \u2019 t want the debt limit to be increased .\nLet \u2019 s take a look at the establishment \u2019 s proposed punishments for Cruz and how they \u2019 re at best ineffective , and at worst counterproductive . Cutting off Cruz from whale donors within the party is , for the moment , pointless . As Time notes , Cruz \u2019 s considerable fundraising strength comes from \u201c a small but vocal part of the base , \u201d which has \u201c given him a powerful grassroots-fundraising platform. \u201d If the Republicans come to Cruz and say \u201c we \u2019 re cutting you off from Wall Street , \u201d Cruz would probably shrug and send out a fundraising email saying he \u2019 s been cut off from Wall Street . ( You could argue that Cruz would need those donors if he ever wants to be president , but he never will be president , so stop making silly arguments . )\nStripping Cruz of his committee assignments would be an embarrassment for him ( assuming Cruz is capable of feeling embarrassment ) but it would absolutely enrage the Tea Party base that considers Cruz its hero . The practical effect of doing that would probably be to further strengthen Cruz \u2019 s appeal to the base by making him a martyr of the establishment .\nThat \u2019 s why this notion of taking \u201c revenge \u201d on Cruz \u2013 while perhaps cathartic to the Republicans he \u2019 s burned and amusing to observers on the left \u2013 is so stupid . Cruz is the type of guy who spins reprimands from the establishment as badges of honor that prove he \u2019 s shaking up the system . To that point , Cruz is himself a perfect expression of the modern Republican base : brash , loud , reflexively oppositional and thoroughly uninterested in the actual business of governing .
