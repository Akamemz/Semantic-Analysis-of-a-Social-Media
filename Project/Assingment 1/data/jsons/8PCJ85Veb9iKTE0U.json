It was the most impressive showing by the GOP since 1938 , when their net House pick up was 80 seats , and the best showing by any party in the House since 1948 , when the Democrats added 75 seats .

It 's almost as if the Senate race does n't exist . \u2014 Kirsten Crippen , Kennewick , Wash .\nA : Well , compared to the Jay Inslee ( D ) vs . Rob McKenna ( R ) gubernatorial race , it does n't . Democratic Senate incumbent Maria Cantwell has an overwhelming lead against her Republican opponent , state Sen. Michael Baumgartner , who comes from the eastern part of the state and is not well known in the more populous western part . In addition , he has not raised much money . Part of the reason the GOP is not investing in Baumgartner 's candidacy is that they are focusing on the gov . race , where they are thought to have a better shot .\nQ : I live in Massachusetts and how I am deciding my vote is whoever bothers me with the least junk mail will get my vote .

Did you really forget about Barbara Boxer and Carly Fiorina in California in 2010 ? \u2014 Gary Nielsen , Tampa , Fla .\nQ : Your Oct. 10 Political Junkie trivia question was , `` Who was the last vice president elected the same year an Ohio professional sports team won a championship . You gave the answer as 1976 , when Walter Mondale was elected V.P . and the Cincinnati Reds won the World Series . This answer is incorrect .

But in second reference the question was said as just `` professional . '' So , either the Political Junkie and NPR do not recognize Major League Soccer as a professional sports league ( although all indications suggest that it will soon replace NHL in the `` Big Four '' ) , or they simply `` dropped the ball '' on the question . \u2014 Ben Hoelzel , Columbus , Ohio ( similarly , Mark Merck of West Fargo , N.D. ; James Schramm of St. Clairsville , Ohio ; Frank McCormick of Boise , Idaho ; and Martin Long of Arlington , Mass . )\nA : When I asked the question , I did indeed limit the sports to football , baseball , basketball and hockey .

Bush finished with 271 electoral votes \u2014 one more than the magic number of 270 \u2014 and Al Gore with 266 . ( Gore should have had 267 EVs , but one Gore elector from the District of Columbia withheld her vote . )\nQ : Who was the first spouse to speak for a presidential candidate at a national convention ?

I ca n't imagine Mamie Eisenhower speaking at a convention ! \u2014 Charles Hamm , Raleigh , N.C .\nA : Mamie did not , but Eleanor Roosevelt did , in July of 1940 . And she spoke less of her husband than she did of FDR 's choice of Henry Wallace to be his running mate .
