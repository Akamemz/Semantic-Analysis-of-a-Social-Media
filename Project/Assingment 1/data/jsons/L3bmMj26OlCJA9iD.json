    "content_original": "Brussels (AFP) - Europe's refugee and migrant crisis has escalated over the summer, leaving the continent divided over how to deal with a flood of people led by Syrians fleeing war in their homeland.\n\nA record surge in numbers, and the opening up of new routes over the Balkans in addition to the Mediterranean sea route, have prompted the EU to call a special meeting on the issue in two weeks.\n\nHere are the key questions and answers about the biggest crisis of its kind to face Europe since World War II:\n\n\n\n\n\n- WHY IS THE SURGE HAPPENING NOW? -\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation in Syria, the origin of the largest number of refugees, has worsened because of the rise of the Islamic State extremist group and continuing civil war, so more people are fleeing.\n\nMore people are coming directly to Europe instead of staying in refugee camps in neighbouring countries that are bursting at the seams, says Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency.\n\nBut also the longer people spend in refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, the more likely they are to realise they cannot start a new life there and want to leave, especially with no sign of the four-year civil war ending anytime soon.\n\nRecently people are being drawn by Germany's announcement that it expects to process 800,000 asylum applications this year, and Berlin's decision to become the first EU state to stop automatically returning Syrian asylum-seekers to their first EU port of entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n- HOW MANY ARE ARRIVING? -\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 340,000 refugees and migrants illegally crossed the border into Europe from January to July 2015, according to the EU's border agency Frontex. The figure compares to 280,000 for the whole of 2014.\n\nThe UN refugee agency separately gives the figure of more than 300,000 migrants and refugees having crossed the Mediterranean so far this year, compared to 219,000 crossings in the whole of 2014.\n\nAround 2,500 have died this year so far, compared to 3,500 for the whole of last year, it says.\n\n\n\n\n\n- WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? -\n\n\n\n\n\nSyria and Afghanistan were the two countries most represented among migrants entering the EU, according to Frontex.\n\nThe top five countries for arrivals in Europe on all sea crossings are Syria (43 percent), Eritrea (10 percent), Nigeria (5 percent), Somalia (3 percent), and others (27 percent), according to the UN.\n\nNine out of ten of those making the Mediterranean crossing to Italy are Africans, however.\n\nBut nearly a fifth of those coming over the Balkans are Kosovans, leading Germany and other EU states to call for a register of 'safe' countries to which migrants can be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n- WHERE ARE THEY ARRIVING, AND BY WHAT ROUTES? -\n\n\n\n\n\nGreece, Hungary and Italy are bearing the brunt of the problem.\n\nGreece had the most landings with nearly 200,000 this year, the UN says.
