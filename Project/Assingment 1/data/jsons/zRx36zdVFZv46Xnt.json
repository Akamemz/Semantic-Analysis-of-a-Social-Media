It \u2019 s an area of speculation that his own agency says \u201c displays a dangerous lack of expertise \u201d by amateurs .\nTRUMP , on the virus : \u201c I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute , one minute . And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs . So it would be interesting to check that ... you \u2019 re going to have to use medical doctors ... but it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me. \u201d \u2014 briefing Thursday .\nThe fact Trump would even flirt with the idea prompted a statement from Reckitt Benckiser , parent company of the maker of Lysol and Dettol , that \u201c under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body ( through injection , ingestion or any other route ) . \u201d\nClorox echoed that bleach and other disinfectants \u201c are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances . \u201d\nThe U.S. surgeon general \u2019 s office moved to discourage people from thinking they can self-medicate from something in the house : \u201c PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/medication to yourself or a loved one . \u201d\nAs the blowback unfolded , Trump said Friday he was being sarcastic the day before .\nTRUMP , on an unproved theory that sunlight , heat and humidity can destroy the virus faster than inside the house : \u201c I hope people enjoy the sun .

And if heat is good , and if sunlight is good , that \u2019 s a great thing as far as I \u2019 m concerned . \u201d\nTHE FACTS : Sunlight may be a disinfectant for the spirit and outdoor exercise is recommended in today \u2019 s social isolation , but there \u2019 s no proof it will make the pandemic go away . Without declaring that it would , Trump is again giving traction to a theory that could prompt people to let down their guard around others outside .\nWlliam Bryan , who leads the Homeland Security Department \u2019 s science and technology directorate , told the briefing about incomplete , \u201c emerging results \u201d from research that suggest solar light , heat and humidity might be effective at neutralizing the virus . Past studies have not found good evidence of that .\nDr. Michael Ryan , the World Health Organization \u2019 s emergencies chief , said in March that \u201c it \u2019 s a false hope to say yes , it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza. \u201d Trump said early in the outbreak he expected it to end with the warmer weather of April .\nTRUMP : \u201c We have now Tested more than 5 Million People . That is more than any other country in the World , and even more than all major countries combined ! \u201d \u2014 tweet Saturday .\nTHE FACTS : Actually , the U.S. has tested far fewer people than \u201c major countries combined \u201d and lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally .\nTogether , just three major countries -- Russia , Germany and Italy -- have tested about 6.5 million people , compared with over 5 million in the U.S. And the United States is easily outdistanced when testing in other Group of Seven countries is added to the mix , as well as powers such as India . Moreover , the count does not include China , which has more than four times the population of the U.S. but has not published national testing numbers .\nMore than 30 other countries have tested a larger share of the population than has been done in the U.S. , which was slow to make COVID-19 diagnoses available and still can \u2019 t offer it to everyone who might be infected .\nTRUMP , on the chances of the virus returning in the fall : \u201c If it does come back \u2014 it \u2019 s not going to come back \u2014 and I \u2019 ve spoken to 10 different people , it \u2019 s not going to be like it was . ...
