He was also accused of being sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan .\n\u201c These are damnably false charges , \u201d Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee on the first day of his confirmation hearings . \u201c The voter fraud case my office prosecuted was in response to pleas from African-American , incumbent elected officials . \u201d\nNoting that he prosecuted a KKK member who murdered a black teenager , Sessions added : \u201c I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology. \u201d In later questioning , Sessions addressed the racism allegations again .\n\u201c The caricature of me in 1986 was not correct , \u201d Sessions said , his voice rising . \u201c I do not harbor the kind of animosity and race-based discrimination ideas that I was accused of . I did not . \u201d\nDuring the first hours of the high-stakes hearing , senators ran through reams of questioning on legal affairs and contentious policy issues \u2014 such as immigration , abortion and waterboarding \u2014 and on more obscure topics such as Sessions \u2019 views of the role of the Justice Department \u2019 s Office of Legal Counsel . Though tense at times , the tone stayed relatively civil , without much in the way of political fireworks .\nOn waterboarding , for example , Sessions noted that \u201c Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding \u2026 or any other form of torture by our military and by our other departments and agencies , \u201d although he had defended the practice during a 2008 floor speech . Trump made it a campaign pledge to revive waterboarding , but has signaled since his election that he may reconsider his view .\nThe one exception to the relatively cordial tone came from Sen. Al Franken ( D-Minn. ) , who delivered the most contentious grilling of the day , essentially accusing Sessions of lying about the number of desegregation and civil rights cases he brought as the U.S. attorney in Mobile , Alabama , and about the extent of his involvement in those cases .\n\u201c It \u2019 s fair to expect sitting before us you \u2019 re not going to misrepresent your own record , \u201d Franken said as he zeroed in on Sessions \u2019 statement to National Review in 2009 that he \u201c filed 20 or 30 civil-rights cases to desegregate schools and political organizations and county commissions when I was a United States attorney. \u201d Sessions conceded that statement appeared to be an exaggeration .\nSessions also had a tense moment in an exchange with Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy , who invoked the controversial \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape in which Trump was captured bragging about sexually assaulting women . During the campaign , Sessions , Trump \u2019 s most enthusiastic supporter in the Senate , told The Weekly Standard that he did not \u201c characterize that as sexual assault. \u201d The senator later said the publication took him out of context .\nLeahy asked Sessions to revisit the issue on Tuesday , asking : \u201d Is grabbing a woman by her genitals , without consent , is that sexual assault ? \u201d\nEarlier , in response to some of the first questions of the hearing , Sessions made a surprise announcement , declaring that he would recuse himself from all issues related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s private email account . He said his rhetoric on the issue during the campaign could lead people to doubt he \u2019 d be fair in considering the matter .\n\u201c I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question . \u2026 I believe the proper thing for me to do would be for me to recuse myself from any questions regarding those kinds of investigations regarding Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign , \u201d Sessions said .\nThe attorney general pick also appeared to offer an implicit rebuke to President-elect Trump , who declared during a debate that he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor who would put Clinton \u201c in jail \u201d over her handling of the email matter . Sessions said , in essence , that he would not accept such an instruction and would instead formally recuse himself .\nSessions , despite his staunchly conservative views on abortion and gay marriage , testified before the committee that the Supreme Court has ruled on those issues and that he would \u201c follow \u201d those decisions . On immigration , Sessions said he has \u201c no objection \u201d to abandoning President Barack Obama \u2019 s executive actions on immigration because \u201c it is very questionable in my opinion , constitutionally. \u201d But he declined to spell out what specifically the Trump administration plans to do with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , or what he would do with the 740,000 so-called Dreamers who \u2019 ve gotten work permits under DACA .\nAnd Sessions also said he does not favor banning Muslim immigrants from the U.S. , as Trump initially proposed .\n\u201c I believe the president-elect subsequent to that statement made clear he believes the focus should be on individuals coming from countries that have a history of terrorism , \u201d the Alabama senator said . He explained his decision to vote against a 2015 amendment from Leahy urging no religious test in the immigration process , saying he was concerned the measure suggested that one \u2019 s religious views could never be taken into account by the government , no matter how radical those views .\nIn another departure from the president-elect \u2019 s public comments , Sessions said he \u2019 s inclined to trust the FBI \u2019 s conclusion that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign aimed at interfering with the recent U.S. presidential election .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure it was honorably reached , \u201d Sessions said of the FBI \u2019 s finding , while noting that he has not been briefed by the FBI on the subject .\nUnder questioning by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , one of the most outspoken Republican lawmakers on the issue , Sessions said he sees such hacking episodes as disturbing . However , Sessions linked the election cyber-meddling to alleged hacking of the U.S. government by China and others .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a significant event , \u201d Sessions said . \u201c We have penetration apparently throughout our government apparently by foreign entities. \u201d He also called for \u201c developing some protocols which , when people breach our systems , a real price is paid even if we can \u2019 t prove the exact person who did it . \u201d\nHe had come before before the Judiciary Committee with a simple message to his fellow senators : You know me . His prepared remarks touched on a litany of policy issues in the purview of the Justice Department \u2014 voting accessibility , police-community relations , the war on terror , even gay rights . But his message , at its core , was one that emphasized his deep ties with senators .\n\u201c You know who I am . You know what I believe in . You know that I am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do , \u201d Sessions told senators . \u201c You know that I revere our Constitution and am committed to the rule of law . And you know that I believe in fairness , impartiality and equal justice under the law . \u201d\nEven before the hearing began , the racial issues were dramatically brought to the fore . A few minutes before the session kicked off , a pair of protesters from the liberal group Code Pink donned Ku Klux Klan attire and began shouting at Sessions .\n\u201c Jefferson Beauregard , here we are . We \u2019 re here for you , \u201d one protester said . \u201c You \u2019 re the man . You \u2019 re the man that \u2019 s going to bring the whiteness back to the South . \u201d\nThose demonstrators were quickly escorted out by Capitol Police who flanked both sides of the public area of the spectators gallery , although many who didn \u2019 t join in the early protest remained seated in that section .\nIn her opening remarks , California Sen.
