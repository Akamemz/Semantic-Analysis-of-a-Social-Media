    "content": "It 's been eleven years since terrorists attacked the United States on September 11 , 2001 , and the lessons have not been forgotten . In the intervening years , the United States ' foreign and domestic security policy has been revamped and improved , and we have not suffered another attack on American soil .\nPresident George W. Bush 's words to a joint session of Congress mere days after the atrocities echo with a message of vigilince , tolerance and thoughtfulness . I will excerpt them here , but highly recommend reading them in full .\nOn September the 11th , enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country . Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136 years , they have been wars on foreign soil , except for one Sunday in 1941 . Americans have known the casualties of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning . Americans have known surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of civilians . All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world , a world where freedom itself is under attack . Americans have many questions tonight . Americans are asking : Who attacked our country ? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda . They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , and responsible for bombing the USS Cole . Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime . But its goal is not making money ; its goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere . ... And tonight , the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban : Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land . Release all foreign nationals , including American citizens , you have unjustly imprisoned . Protect foreign journalists , diplomats , and aid workers in your country . Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan , and hand over every terrorist , and every person in their support structure , to appropriate authorities . Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps , so we can make sure they are no longer operating . These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion . The Taliban must act , and act immediately . They will hand over the terrorists , or they will share in their fate . Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do . And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress , I thank you , their representatives , for what you have already done and for what we will do together . Tonight , we face new and sudden national challenges . We will come together to improve air safety , to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights , and take new measures to prevent hijacking . We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying , with direct assistance during this emergency . We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home . We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act , and to find them before they strike . We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America 's economy , and put our people back to work . Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers : Governor George Pataki , and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani . As a symbol of America 's resolve , my administration will work with Congress , and these two leaders , to show the world that we will rebuild New York City .\nThat last exhortation - rebuild New York City - still rings true today . Ground Zero in New York has faced its share of trials , tribulations , bureaucracy and regulation , but it 's finally been gaining traction in recent years .
