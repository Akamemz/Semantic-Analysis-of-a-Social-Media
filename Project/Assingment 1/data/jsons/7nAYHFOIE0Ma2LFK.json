In 2015 , President Barack Obama referred to Baltimore rioters as \u201c thugs \u201d as well . He likely did so because \u201c thug \u201d \u2014 defined as a \u201c violent person , especially a criminal \u201d \u2014 is a good way to describe rioters . It \u2019 s true that not everyone in a riot engages in wanton violent criminality . Some participants are merely \u201c looters \u201d \u2014 defined as \u201c people who steal goods during a riot. \u201d That word is also allegedly imbued with racist conations , according to the executive editor of the Los Angeles Times and others .\nAttempting to dictate what words we can use is another way to exert power over how we think .

Now we \u2019 re at the stage of the revolution where completely inoffensive and serviceable words are branded problematic .\nCNN recently pulled together its own list of words and phrases with racist connotations that have helped bolster systemic racism in America . Unsuspecting citizens , the piece explains , may not even be aware they are engaging in this linguistic bigotry , because most words are \u201c so entrenched that Americans don \u2019 t think twice about using them . But some of these terms are directly rooted in the nation \u2019 s history with chattel slavery . Others now evoke racist notions about Black people. \u201d Or , in other words , the meaning of these phrases and words are so obscured by history that the average person wouldn \u2019 t even know to be offended if it weren \u2019 t for CNN .\nThe term \u201c peanut gallery \u201d \u2014 as in \u201c please , no comment from the peanut gallery \u201d \u2014 is racist because it harkens back to the days when poor and black Americans were relegated to back sections of theaters .
