Henry Cuellar ( D-Texas ) , in a way that few candidates ever get to : she once worked for him .\nIn 2014 , Cisneros , then 21 years old and attending the University of Texas at Austin , was Cuellar \u2019 s intern in Washington D.C. , where she worked 9 to 5 every day in his office for several months .

Her primary challenge against Cuellar\u2014an anti-abortion Democrat with an A rating from the NRA\u2014has received national attention as progressives aim to unseat one of the most conservative members of their party . Many progressives consider this primary to be the most important congressional election taking place this cycle , and certainly the most important congressional primary taking place on Super Tuesday .
