Ron DeSantis is signing into law a bill that formalizes that amendment but adds a controversial definition : tying the full payment of fees , fines , and restitution to the phrase \u201c sentence served . \u201d\nLast fall , Florida voters passed the largest reenfranchisement of U.S. voters in more than 40 years . Originally , it would have involved some 1.4 million Floridians who had served their felony sentences .\nCoral Nichols estimates she will have to live to 188 to be able to vote again in her home state of Florida .\nFor the devoted \u201c duty , honor , country \u201d Republican , that is heartbreak after hope .\nHaving completed her prison sentence for grand theft , Ms. Nichols believed she would have her right to vote restored after 64 percent of Floridians voted in favor of Amendment 4 last November . The amendment ordered automatic vote restoration for some 1.4 million Floridians who can \u2019 t vote because of past felonies .\nBut this week , Republican Gov . Ron DeSantis is signing into law a bill that formalizes that amendment but adds a controversial definition : tying the full payment of fees , fines , and restitution to the phrase \u201c sentence served . \u201d\nIt is not by definition a poll tax , as critics have termed it . But it is also , Ms. Nichols argues , not fair . Yes , she owes $ 190,000 in restitution , but she says her judge made clear that she has no criminal sentence obligations left after he converted her debt into a civil lien , toward which she pays $ 100 a month .\n\u201c I call it the gray area \u2013 people like me who do not fit your black-and-white , cookie-cutter , one-size-fits-all policies , \u201d says Ms. Nichols , who runs a nonprofit prison diversion program in Seminole , Florida . \u201c My sentence is complete , I \u2019 m completed , and this is the thing that echoes within the very depths of my soul . I am the gray , and lawmakers need to consider the people in the gray . \u201d\nThe vote last fall became the largest reenfranchisement of U.S. voters since 18-year-olds were given the right to vote in 1971 . Originally , it would have involved some 1.4 million Floridians \u2013 more voters , in fact , than there are Vermonters .\nThere will still be as many as 840,000 \u201c returning citizens \u201d surging the polls , a new army of voters that could hold huge sway in the tightly divided swing state .\nYet in withholding the vote from about half a million people like Ms. Nichols , \u201c it \u2019 s quite clear the Legislature has gone well beyond what nearly two-thirds of Floridians thought they were voting on , \u201d says University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith , an expert on how legislatures treat ballot measures .\n\u201c The [ constitutional ] amendment says , if you read it , you have to complete your sentence , \u201d Governor DeSantis said at an environmental issue forum at the University of Miami \u2019 s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science . \u201c And I think most people understand you can be sentenced to jail , probation , restoration if you harm someone . You can be sentenced with a fine . People that bilk people out of money , sometimes that is an appropriate sentence . That \u2019 s what the constitutional provision said . I think the Legislature just implemented that as it \u2019 s written . \u201d\nTwo of the people behind Amendment 4 \u2013 Desmond Meade and Neil Volz \u2013 opposed the addition . They say their organization , the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition , attended myriad Senate subcommittee meetings as the bill made its way through the statehouse . One day 600 former felons showed up to discuss the amendment .\nTo critics , the decision of the Legislature and governor to impose their will on the law is part of an emerging Republican playbook : winning by subtraction . The stakes are huge , with Florida shaping up to be a key battleground in 2020 .\n\u201c The plight of voter rights [ in Florida ] is part of that bigger narrative of the right : to win at the margins , \u201d says Texas Tech University political scientist Seth McKee , a longtime Florida observer . \u201c It \u2019 s not a Southern thing . It \u2019 s a competition thing . \u201d\nYet the nine-year effort to restore full citizenship to former felons , its proponents say , remains \u201c about people , not politics . \u201d\nAmendment 4 \u201c was framed as a question of right and wrong , of morality , of returning a civic voice to people who had served their sentences \u2013 a come-back-home , \u201d says David Daley , author of \u201c The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America \u2019 s Democracy. \u201d \u201c That united people across racial lines in Florida . ... This was a supermajority of Republicans , Democrats , independents , whites , blacks , Latinos \u2013 a real coalition . \u201d\nThe decision by Mr. DeSantis and the GOP-led Legislature to alter the decision of nearly two-thirds of a state \u2019 s electorate is not an uncommon reaction to ballot initiatives . The Massachusetts Legislature voted to delay legalizing recreational marijuana sales after voters approved it in 2016 . Also in 2016 , voters in Maine approved four ballot questions and a bond issue . In 2017 , the state Legislature voted to amend or repeal three of the four measures . ( Maine lawmakers tried but ultimately failed to repeal a ranked-choice voting law . )\nBut Florida also has a history of voter suppression that traces back to the Civil War . Historians there say that the roots can be traced back to the day when a group of boys and older men fended off a Union attempt to take Tallahassee in early 1865 , leaving it the only Confederate capital not to fall .\nSteve Cannon/AP Gov . Ron DeSantis ( c. ) is applauded by Senate president Bill Galvano , R-Bradenton ( l. ) , House speaker Jose Oliva R-Miami Lakes ( center r. ) , and Lt Gov . Jeanette Nunez ( far r. ) , at the end of session May 4 in Tallahassee , Florida .\nThat factored into the Florida \u2019 s unique sense of invincibility , that it could in practice , if not legally , ignore what Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles H. DuPont in 1865 called \u201c the exactions of the fanatical theorists . \u201d\n\u201c Deep into Florida history , back when Florida was a Southern state , there was a realization after the Civil War that [ black people ] are potential voters now , \u201d says Gary Mormino , author of \u201c Land of Sunshine , State of Dreams , \u201d a social history of Florida . \u201c And [ the disenfranchisement ] that happened wasn \u2019 t really a conspiracy , because it was pretty wide out in the open . They basically said , \u2018 What can we do to keep African Americans from taking over Florida ? \u2019 \u201d\nTo be sure , Florida was also the first state to abandon the poll tax in the 1930s , setting it on a course that differentiates it from the rest of the Deep South to this day . Today , it is \u201c not a Southern state , \u201d as Mr. Mormino says , but more a smudged window on the nation .\nFor some former felons who will be able to vote in the next election , the state \u2019 s unique social and historical dynamic reverberates in their desire to be \u201c returning citizens. \u201d And the battleground nature of the state , they say , means that the plight of a single person \u2019 s rights in Florida should be a concern for all Americans .\n\u201c Florida has a national spotlight on it ; it \u2019 s a transient state , all those different attitudes and traditions coming together \u2013 a place where it \u2019 s way too hot and people \u2019 s tempers get out of control , \u201d says Lance Wissinger , a former felon whose new Florida voter registration card sits behind his ID in his wallet . \u201c It \u2019 s the swamp , man . It is a mixing bowl of just craziness , and I think that spills over into the politics of the state . \u201d\nIn the 20th century , the state pioneered a slew of onerous rules that disproportionately affected black voters . It was the first and only state to add larceny \u2013 a civil matter \u2013 to the list of disqualifying crimes . The threshold for a third-degree felony was set at $ 300 , the lowest in the United States .\nThe strategies were so effective that in the 1960s there were only seven black people registered to vote in Gadsden County \u2013 a county that had about 12,000 African Americans old enough to vote , according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\nBefore November \u2019 s vote , Florida also had the country \u2019 s strictest clemency system . Since its rules were changed in 2011 under former Gov . Rick Scott , only 3,005 of 30,000 applicants had their voting rights restored .\nThat put Florida \u2013 ground zero of the 2000 election controversy that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 into a class of its own when it comes to disenfranchisement . Some 10 percent of all potential voters and 21 percent of potential black voters had lost the right to vote .\n\u201c It is hard to believe that the intensity of the partisan efforts now to put up barriers between certain voters and the ballot box is unrelated to the larger questions of a changing America , \u201d says Mr. Daley .\nThere appears to be a perception on both sides of the political aisle that more of the new voters may lean Democrat than Republican , but no one actually knows their political makeup , Professor McKee says .\n\u201c Republicans own the tough on crime issue , so , knowing that , any Republican would look [ at ex-felons ] and say , \u2018 Oh , boy , these people getting out of prison \u2013 that is not my constituency. \u2019 And I think they are right , for the most part . But there could be a lot of those white guys who are coming out who like Trump . What is to say they don \u2019 t ? \u201d\nFor example , the next time Floridians go to the ballot box , Mr. Wissinger will be there .\nAfter being convicted for manslaughter for the death of his best friend in a drunk driving accident , Mr. Wissinger became a model citizen in prison \u2013 the kind of prisoner who , while incarcerated , wins a silver medal at the America \u2019 s Chef Competition as part of a work release program and starts a Toastmasters club behind bars .\nHe is a registered Republican and now owner of a drone company in South Florida , and his quest to vote touches on something common among people who can \u2019 t vote : personal quests not just for redemption , but also for restoration of their patriotic worth .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think you can be a citizen without a vote , \u201d says Mr. Wissinger . \u201c When I was finally able to register to vote again ... I was asked afterward about how I felt , and I was , like , \u2018 Man , it \u2019 s New Year \u2019 s Day . It \u2019 s a whole brand-new start to everything . \u2019 \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nRepublicans , says Mr. Volz of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition , have not been deaf to those points . The Legislature recently raised the third-degree felony minimum to $ 750 \u2013 a small yet substantial change .\n\u201c What we are seeing is that people like myself who have lost our voice and then regained it , we \u2019 re the biggest evangelists for democracy , \u201d says Mr. Volz , a former Republican congressional aide who was convicted for his involvement with the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal . \u201c That means we will continue to move forward in the spirit of Amendment 4 , which is one of celebration of democracy and a belief in second chances .
