Can you imagine a worse injustice ?\nThat is , in all seriousness , the argument of Kyle Kashuv , an 18-year-old who became a gun rights activist in response to his classmates at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida , who themselves became activists against gun violence in the wake of their peers being massacred by a school shooter . Kashuv got into Harvard , and then apparently had his acceptance rescinded after evidence of him making a series of racial slurs appeared online .
