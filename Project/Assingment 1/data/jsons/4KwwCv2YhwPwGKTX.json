It has also taken advantage of the leeway the United States offered in prioritizing a nuclear deal over attempts to restrain Tehran 's proxies that could risk breaking up the negotiations .\nThe result is that Iran -- often through militant groups it sponsors -- has become a key player in conflicts in neighboring states all the way to the edge of the Mediterranean .\nIts drive for regional pre-eminence is becoming an increasing problem for the Obama administration as it contemplates selling a nuclear deal -- which is already drawing considerable skepticism -- to opponents in Congress and to anxious allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel , who are watching Iran 's maneuvering up close .\nJUST WATCHED What to know about the U.S.-Iran nuclear negotations Replay More Videos ...
