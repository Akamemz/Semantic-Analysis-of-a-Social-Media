The most recent is Ezra Klein's erudite reckoning with just how much President Trump's toxic racism and xenophobia diverges from the American norm. Klein's conclusion from a perusal of American history is: not much. The United States has never been especially liberal or democratic for non-whites, and Trump represents the last gasp of those in American life who would like to keep it that way.\n\nIt's likely to be their last gasp because, as Klein writes, \"if current demographic projections hold, we will be a majority-minority nation in less than 30 years.\" Once that happens, the country's formerly white majority will have no choice but to reconcile itself to a changed demographic reality. And that will hopefully allow historians of the future to look back at our moment to conclude that what seemed like a potentially dire threat to liberal democracy in America during the Trump administration was merely \"the turbulence that has always accompanied racial progress in this country.\"\n\nIt sounds reassuring. But is it true?\n\nDon't bet on it.\n\nYes, the U.S. is on track to become at some point around 2045 a \"minority white\" nation \u2014 in the sense that if we lump every person who isn't white into a single demographic category of \"non-white,\" whites will be outnumbered. The problem is that no such politically homogeneous category of citizen exists in the real world. It's the creation of demographers and liberal data journalists eager to mollify their anxieties.\n\nSuch people convince themselves of its reality by making a habit of talking about how \"people of color\" are uniformly oppressed by hegemonic \"whiteness\" in the United States. But the truth is that people of Hispanic, African, West Indian, East Asian, South Asian, and Arab descent don't perceive themselves as (or vote as if they are) members of a unified bloc. They are discrete groups. Most of them do lean Democratic, but not uniformly, and they do so for disparate reasons rooted in the cultures they brought with them to this country and in their distinct histories since arriving.
