    "content": "Amid the global debate about race relations , colonialism and slavery , some of the Europeans and Americans who made their fortunes in trading human beings have seen their legacies reassessed , their statues toppled and their names removed from public buildings .\nNigerian journalist and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani writes that one of her ancestors sold slaves , but argues that he should not be judged by today 's standards or values .\nMy great-grandfather , Nwaubani Ogogo Oriaku , was what I prefer to call a businessman , from the Igbo ethnic group of south-eastern Nigeria . He dealt in a number of goods , including tobacco and palm produce .
