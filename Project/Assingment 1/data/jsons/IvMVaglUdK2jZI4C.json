Furthermore , when police engage armed felons with their service pistols , should that be considered gun violence ? If we \u2019 re tracking gun violence ( i.e . homicides or other acts of violence committed by one person against another ) in instances that resulted in fatalities , then the study has inflated numbers .\nEven though violent crime has steadily declined in recent years\u2014overall violent crime declined 19 percent between 2003 and 2012 , and the murder rate declined 17 percent during that period\u2014rates of gun violence remain unacceptably high . On average , 33,000 Americans are killed with guns each year , and the burden of this violence falls disproportionately on young people : 54 percent of people murdered with guns in 2010 were under the age of 30.3 Young people are also disproportionately the perpetrators of gun violence , as weak gun laws offer easy access to guns in many parts of the country . Far too often , a gun not only takes the life of one young American but also contributes to ruining the life of another young person who pulls the trigger .\nSo , CAP just admitted that the murder rate has gone down . In fact , firearm-related homicides have declined 39 percent between 1993-2011 . That \u2019 s based on figures from the Department of Justice ( via WaPo ) :\nThe report , by the department \u2019 s Bureau of Justice Statistics , painted an encouraging picture of long-term trends at a time of divisive political debate over guns and legislation to regulate them . Firearms-related homicides declined 39 percent between 1993 and 2011 , the report said , while nonfatal firearms crimes fell 69 percent during that period . \u2026 Overall , the Justice Department report said , firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011 , while nonfatal firearm crimes declined from 1.5 million in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011 . The drop extended to schools : Homicides at schools declined from an average of 29 per year in the 1990s to an average of 20 per year in the 2000s .\nMoreover , Pew Research also conducted a study finding that gun crime dropped 49 percent between 1993-2010 :\nCompared with 1993 , the peak of U.S. gun homicides , the firearm homicide rate was 49 % lower in 2010 , and there were fewer deaths , even though the nation \u2019 s population grew . The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm\u2014assaults , robberies and sex crimes\u2014was 75 % lower in 2011 than in 1993 . Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall ( with or without a firearm ) also is down markedly ( 72 % ) over two decades . \u2026 Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence , most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago . According to a new Pew Research Center survey , today 56 % of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 % think it is lower .\nWhile Pew noted that the gun homicide rates are the highest for the 18-24 , 25-40 demographic ; the rate is also on a rapid decline .\nAdditionally , mass shootings aren \u2019 t on the rise .
