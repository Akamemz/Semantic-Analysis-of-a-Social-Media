With this claim , Weiss will have many of her fellow elites nodding along sympathetically : the open letter , combined with a pearl-clutchingly offended response to Bennet \u2019 s ouster , has made it clear that there is a section of the professional intellectual class \u2013 pundits , thinktank operatives and tenured professors \u2013 who feel shocked and affronted by the online rudeness of those who disagree with them . This clique has ushered in a creature unique to the era of internet media , whose ascent ironically threatens to plunge our public discourse even further into the realm of bad faith : the professionally cancelled pundit .\nThe professionally cancelled pundit is a genre of primarily center-right contrarian who makes their living by deliberately provoking outrage online , and then claiming that the outrage directed at them is evidence of an intolerant left run amok .
