But a group of the House \u2019 s most conservative and Tea Party-sympathetic lawmakers are concerned the momentum might be headed in the wrong direction , and they \u2019 re cooking up alternatives to rein in the president .\n\u201c We \u2019 re pretty sure they \u2019 re going to do something just for the sake of doing something , \u201d Rep.

He \u2019 s also suggested arming school teachers .\nMany of Trump \u2019 s positions signal a clear break from the traditional Republican talking points on mass shootings , which typically steer away from any actual gun control-related measures .
