    "content": "For many Americans , the most painful consequence of the coronavirus lockdowns was closing down church services . The grace and peace of Sunday makes it easier to make it through the week . But our media and political elites are indifferent to that pain , or openly hostile .\nThe New York Times recently proclaimed `` Churches Emerge as Major Source of Coronavirus Cases . '' A three-reporter team announced their newspaper constructed a database to count church-spawned infections as the `` virus rages '' and blamed 650 infections across America on church activities . How , then , is this a `` Major Source '' of cases ?\nMost regular churchgoers did n't want to fit into that secular-media stereotype of being so fanatically trusting in God 's protection that they would gather unmasked in churches and share hugs and handshakes . Church singers would disband their choirs for the duration . They were willing to observe lockdowns as a public-health necessity .\nBut then came the `` Black Lives Matter '' protests clogging the streets to protest the death of George Floyd . Suddenly , mass gatherings were not only allowed , they were praised and glorified on a global scale . The coronavirus counters dropped off cable-news screens , replaced by `` beautiful '' protest scenes , live from the streets .\nThere wo n't be a headline in The New York Times that announces `` Protests Emerge as Major Source of Coronavirus Cases . '' The Times created no database to warn of any dangerously disobedient and unscientific citizens among the `` progressives . ''\nInstead , the newspapers proclaimed there was little evidence to suggest massive street protests were spreading the virus . `` Public health experts '' exempted protests from their danger zone , and some even marched themselves .\nIt 's a blatant double standard that strongly suggests that in today 's America , protests are the most sacred activity , far more sacred than Americans gathering to worship God . But not all protests , obviously . Protesting the lockdowns in May was pitched as a dangerously nutty exercise of the First Amendment . CNN 's warning headline on screen was `` Protesters , Some Armed , Descend on Michigan Capitol . ''\nLeftist protesters never `` descend on '' any place .... even when they gathered to vandalize CNN headquarters in Atlanta . In May , CNN cued up Democrat Gov . Gretchen Whitmer to describe how the people protesting her restrictions were a band of scary gun-lugging extremists , maybe even Nazis and Confederates .\nIn a similar Democrat-enabling interview last week , CNN 's Wolf Blitzer brought on New York 's mayor , Bill de Blasio , to explain how he has banned large gatherings in his city , but exempted the police-bashing protests .\nThe mayor said staying at home is best , `` but we understand that this moment in history , people are talking about the need for historic changes . '' He touted his prank-painting of `` Black Lives Matter ' in front of Trump Tower , and repeated `` this is a historic moment of change . We have to respect that , but also say to people that the kinds of gatherings we 're used to , the parades , the fairs , we just ca n't have that while we 're focusing on health right now .

'' He asked about a tennis tournament .\nIn short , our media elites do n't care when religious believers of all colors and creeds are demoted to second-class citizens in a dizzying array of `` affirmative discrimination .
