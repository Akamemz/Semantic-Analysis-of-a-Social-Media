The unemployment rate ticked higher to 3.6 % , but for the right reason as the labor force participation rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 63.4 % , matching its highest level since June 2013 , according to data released Friday by the Labor Department . Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for payroll growth of 158,000 and the jobless rate to stay at 3.5 % , its lowest in more than 50 years .\nA more encompassing labor market indicator that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons also moved higher , rising 0.2 percentage points to 6.9 % . The so-called real unemployment rate previously had been at its lowest level in the history of the data series . However , the employment-to-population ratio in the household survey rose to 61.2 % , its highest since November 2008 and 0.5 percentage points higher than a year ago .\nA worker builds a 2020 Ford Explorer car at Ford 's Chicago Assembly Plant in Chicago , June 24 , 2019 . Kamil Krzaczynski | Reuters\nThe weather-sensitive construction industry helped lead the way in job creation , adding 44,000 positions , well above its 2019 average of 12,000 .
