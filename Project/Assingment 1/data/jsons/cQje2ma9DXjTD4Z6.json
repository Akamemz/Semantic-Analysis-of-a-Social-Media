    "content": "Most of the headlines from Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s speech at the American Constitution Society on Thursday were , understandably , about her attacks on Donald Trump .\nHighlighting Warren \u2019 s rapid succession of fusillades against Trump makes sense . After all , outside of this election , you don \u2019 t often get sitting US senators publicly calling the other party 's presidential nominee a `` racist bully '' who has `` never risked anything for anyone and who serves no one but himself . ''\nBut Warren \u2019 s speech did much more than go after Trump . In her high-profile address , she pivoted from attacking the likely GOP nominee to attacking Republicans more generally , accusing the party \u2019 s leaders of orchestrating a prolonged `` assault '' on the independence of the federal judiciary in order to serve the wealthiest Americans .\nFor instance , when Warren highlighted Trump \u2019 s racist attacks against Judge Gonzalo Curiel , she said they were born from the same essential motivation as other mainstream Republican initiatives like the blockade of Merrick Garland \u2019 s Supreme Court nomination and the Citizens United decision on campaign finance : to help the richest of the rich .\n`` Donald Trump chose racism as his weapon , '' Warren said . `` But his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans : to pound the courts into submission for the rich and the powerful . ''\nNow , it should be noted that many leading Republicans , like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan , have condemned Trump 's remarks about Curiel . So it doesn \u2019 t seem entirely fair to blame them for what Trump has said there .\nBut the line does give us insight into how one of the leading progressives sees Trump , and it suggests how a Warren-led Democratic Party might respond in 2016 and beyond .\nSen. Warren : Donald Trump is a `` Mitch McConnell kind of candidate ''\nMany Democrats have said that Trump \u2019 s rhetoric against Curiel amounts to proof that he \u2019 s uniquely unfit for the presidency , as a sign that he goes far beyond even what other Republicans are willing to say .\nWarren didn \u2019 t take this approach . Over and over , she insisted that Trump \u2019 s comments about Curiel reflect the Republican attacks on the courts \u2014 the only difference being that they \u2019 re done with less tact .\nWhere do you suppose that Donald Trump got the idea that he can personally attack judges , regardless of the law , whenever they do n't bend to the whims of billionaires and big businesses ? He 's a Mitch McConnell kind of candidate \u2026 He is exactly the kind of candidate you 'd expect from a Republican Party whose script for several years has been to execute a full-scale assault on the integrity of our courts , blockading judicial appointments so Donald Trump can fill them . Smearing and intimidating nominees who do not pledge allegiance to the financial interests of the rich and powerful . Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell want Donald Trump to appoint the next generation of judges . They want those judges to tilt the law in favor of big businesses and billionaires like Donald Trump .
