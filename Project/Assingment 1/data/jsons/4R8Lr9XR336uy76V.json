It was a victory for a coalition of advocates from across the political spectrum who had pushed policy makers to reconsider harsh sentencing laws as crime rates fell over the past quarter-century .\nThe Justice Department has begun implementing key aspects of the law , which expands job training and other programs designed to reduce recidivism and help offenders transition back into their communities . Department officials on Friday unveiled a centerpiece of the law , a risk and needs assessment through which federal inmates will be evaluated to see what programs and treatments could help reduce their risk of re-offending . Those who successfully complete programs can earn credits that will expedite their release .\nThe new tool is more accurate than the existing risk-assessment system , and aims to limit gender and racial biases in the evaluation process , officials said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a long overdue change , \u201d said Kevin Ring , president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums , which has long advocated for sentencing reform and helped Mr. Walker with his case . \u201c In terms of implementing these types of provisions , it seems to be moving forward . \u201d\nMore than 1,690 federal inmates have qualified for release under the resentencing provisions of the law , and nearly 1,100 have already walked free , the official said . They were initially sentenced under old statutes in which crack offenders , most of them black , received significantly harsher punishments than mostly white defendants who were convicted of crimes involving the powder form of the drug .\nCongress in 2010 passed legislation that reduced that disparity , but the change wasn \u2019 t retroactive and therefore didn \u2019 t apply to people like Mr. Walker , who pleaded guilty in 2006 to possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine . His parole officer caught him with the drugs\u2014and three firearms\u2014while police in Jacksonville , Ill. , were investigating an unrelated burglary , court records show . Because Mr. Walker had two prior drug convictions , he received a mandatory sentence of life in prison .\nOnce the First Step Act was passed , Mr. Walker requested relief and saw his sentence reduced to 180 months .\nOther inmates have been similarly successful .
