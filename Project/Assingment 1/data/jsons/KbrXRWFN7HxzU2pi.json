    "content": "Rand Paul traveled to Des Moines , Iowa , recently and delivered a sure-fire applause line . \u201c Anybody here want to audit the Fed ? \u201d the Kentucky senator asked . \u201c Anybody feel that the Fed \u2019 s out to get us ? \u201d\nHe followed it up with an op-ed comparing the Federal Reserve to Lehman Brothers and calling it essentially bankrupt . The bash-the-Fed routine , perfected by Paul \u2019 s father , former Texas congressman Ron Paul , is political gold with libertarian voters suspicious of all federal authority , especially a central bank with a $ 4.5 trillion balance sheet .\nBut Paul could face a significant challenge if he emerges from Iowa with a legitimate shot at the Republican nomination . Because experts say he gets many of his arguments about the Fed flat wrong . And the establishment wing of the GOP \u2014 backed by piles of Wall Street money \u2014 views Paul \u2019 s approach to the Fed as dangerous and irresponsible .\n\u201c He seems to have a poor understanding of what \u2019 s actually on the Fed balance sheet and how the bank operates , \u201d said James Pethokoukis , a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute . \u201c And if you don \u2019 t have a firm grip on one of your signature issues , people eventually are going to doubt other things you have to say . \u201d\nThe case against Paul \u2019 s case against the Fed is fairly straightforward .\nIn his op-ed , Paul claimed that \u201c [ t ] he Fed has $ 4.5 trillion in liabilities and only 57 billion dollars in equity . It is leveraged at 80:1 , nearly three times greater than Lehman Brothers when it failed . \u201d\nIn fact , the Fed has $ 4.5 trillion in assets , mostly Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Federal government . It has only $ 57 billion in equity because it sends most of its profits to the U.S. Treasury , a total of around $ 500 billion over the past decade .\nAnd it actually has no \u201c leverage \u201d in the traditional sense of the word because it does not borrow money like Lehman Brothers did before it went bankrupt . Instead , the Fed creates money , as all central banks do .\n\u201c The capital of a central bank has very little importance relative to a private institution . The deposits can not run . They are created by the central bank through asset purchases , \u201d said Donald Kohn , a former Fed vice chairman now at the Brookings Institution . \u201c There is essentially no credit risk on the Federal Reserve \u2019 s balance sheet right now , and I don \u2019 t know of any institution in the United States that is subject to more oversight . \u201d\nIn other words , the chances of the Fed blowing up like Lehman are nil .\nThe calculus for Paul is whether his rantings against the Fed \u2014 and his push in Congress to \u201c audit \u201d the institution \u2014 could come back to bite him should he catch fire in 2016 . On many issues , Paul has fought to show that he \u2019 s a different , more moderate politician than his isolationism-leaning , iconoclastic father \u2014 he \u2019 s not even planning to campaign with Ron Paul .\nBut the Paul camp views the \u201c audit the Fed \u201d campaign as a low-stakes way to remind the voters who propelled his father \u2019 s previous presidential bids that the younger Paul is on their side , too .\nAnd some Iowa political operatives say that while the push may raise concerns with the business community down the road , the issue is sufficiently obscure that Paul is not in serious danger of alienating anyone over it at this point .\n\u201c Audit the Fed is an issue that plays to our base voters , \u201d said Steve Grubbs , a top Paul strategist in Iowa . \u201c It \u2019 s an issue that \u2019 s been around for a number of years and it \u2019 s one that \u2019 s important libertarian Republicans know Sen. Paul is fully behind . \u201d\nHe added that \u201c the core of our base [ voters ] are liberty voters \u201d and that \u201c our first job is to earn as much of that base vote as we can. \u201d Ron Paul won 21 percent of the vote in the 2012 Iowa caucuses .\nPaul \u2019 s legislation , which now stands its best chance ever of passing in a GOP-controlled Congress , also appears to ignore the multiple levels of audit the bank currently faces . The bank \u2019 s finances are already subject to audit by the Government Accountability Office , the Fed \u2019 s inspector general and outside audit firms , most recently Deloitte & Touche . Those interested in what \u2019 s on the Fed \u2019 s balance sheet can find out , down to the individual bond , on the website of the New York Federal Reserve .\nCritics of the bill say it is aimed much more directly at repealing a 1978 law establishing Fed independence on monetary policy decisions . Paul \u2019 s bill , though vaguely written , would likely allow the GAO to investigate monetary policy actions and report back to Congress immediately .\nThat alarms even many conservatives at the Fed who say the central bank \u2019 s insulation from short-term political pressure is essential to its ability to function , especially in times of crisis like the nation faced in 2008 and 2009 .\n\u201c The operations and finances of the board of governors and the 12 Federal Reserve banks are already audited up the wazoo , \u201d Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher , a noted conservative , thundered in a recent speech in New York . He added that the Fed already releases minutes of its policy meetings shortly after they are held , while Chair Janet Yellen faces regular news conferences and Capitol Hill questioning .\n\u201c Having proven themselves unable to cobble together with colleagues a working fiscal policy , \u201d Fisher added of \u201c audit the Fed \u201d proponents in Congress , \u201c they simply find it convenient to create a boogeyman out of an entity that does its job efficiently . \u201d\nAnother element of the case against Rand Paul \u2019 s view of the Fed is that his critiques of its policies threatening runaway inflation and crushing the dollar have been wrong . \u201c If people are prepared to carry money to the grocery store in a wheel barrel , that may be coming , \u201d Paul warned on the Glenn Beck radio show in 2011 . \u201c What I worry about is the Weimar Republic , I worry about 1923 in Germany . When they destroyed the currency , they elected Hitler . I don \u2019 t want something like that to happen in our country . \u201d\nInstead , in the ensuing years , inflation declined and the dollar strengthened to the point that it is actually damaging to U.S. exporters .

They also did not respond to a request for comment on the substance of Fed experts \u2019 critiques , instead directing those questions to a pro-audit writer .\nMatt Strawn , a former chairman of the Iowa GOP , said that so far , the only people in the state who are deeply attuned to this issue are the libertarian-oriented Republicans Paul is trying to excite .\n\u201c At this point , I don \u2019 t see other Iowa Republicans following the issue close enough where that would be a liability , \u201d Strawn said . \u201c It seems to be a safe issue that allows him to play to the home team without liability with the broader electorate . \u201d\nWhile the issue may never hurt him with Iowa Republicans , it certainly will with Wall Street Republicans who are lining up heavily behind former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush \u2019 s campaign .\nThe thinking in these circles is that should Paul emerge as a viable threat to get the nomination , an even larger outpouring of money and organizational muscle will be deployed to stop him , in large part out of fear of what a President Paul might do to the Fed .\n\u201c If he comes out of Iowa or begins to emerge with any kind of strength , I think you will see the GOP establishment go on red alert because they are going to view him as a dangerous person , \u201d said one financial services industry executive who did not want to be quoted on record criticizing Paul . \u201c The Fed is the pre-eminent central bank on the planet and no one wants to put that at risk . \u201d\nFear of Paul emerging as a potential nominee is part of what is driving the gush of Wall Street money to Bush , and to some extent to Govs .
