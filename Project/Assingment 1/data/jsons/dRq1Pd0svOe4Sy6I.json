    "content": "( CNN ) President Barack Obama , in his first visit to a mosque in the United States , said Wednesday he was seeking to rebut `` inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans '' from Republican presidential candidates .\nAttempting to recast what he said was a warped image of Islam while encouraging members of the faith to speak out against terror , Obama described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America .\n`` Let me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States : you fit right here , '' Obama told the audience at the Islamic Society of Baltimore , a 47-year-old mosque with thousands of attendees . `` You 're right where you belong . You 're part of America too . You 're not Muslim or American . You 're Muslim and American . ''\nAs he decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny , Obama insisted that applying religious screens would only amplify messages coming from terrorist groups . In his final year in office , Obama has sought to use his public platform -- however waning -- to advocate against what he sees as dangerous threads in the political discourse .\n`` We ca n't be bystanders to bigotry , '' Obama said . `` Together , we 've got to show that America truly protects all faiths . As we protect our country from terrorism , we should not reinforce the ideas and the rhetoric of the terrorists themselves . ''\nDescribing conversations with young Muslim parents whose children are worried about being removed from the country , Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States .\n`` You could not help but be heartbroken by their worries and their anxieties , '' Obama said of an earlier conversation with young Muslim community leaders . `` Some of them are parents , and they talked about how their children were asking , 'Are we going to be forced out of the country ? Are we going to be rounded up ? Why do people treat us like this ? ' Conversations you should n't have to have with children . Not in this country . ''\nWhite House officials said Obama was looking to issue a forceful counterpoint to the language favored by some Republican presidential candidates like Donald Trump , who has proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country until tighter antiterror measures are put into place . But they also hoped to counter GOP claims that Obama has n't been forceful enough in demanding that Muslim leaders help root out extremism .\nObama offered a calibrated message on that front Wednesday , citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement .\n`` Here at this mosque , and across our country and around the world , Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism , '' he said . `` And around the globe , Muslims who 've dared to speak out have often been targeted and even killed So those voices are there ; we just have to amplify them more . ''\nIn his speech , Obama cited a long history of Islam in America , and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media .\n`` We have to ... lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community not when there 's a problem , but all the time . Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security . It 's not that hard to do , '' Obama said .\nObama has visited mosques in the past , but never inside the United States , which is home to 2.75 million Muslims , according to the Pew Research Center . Before Wednesday , many Muslim groups had called for him to schedule a stop at a U.S. mosque as a public rejection of Islamophobia , the same way President George W. Bush did in the days after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .\nBut for Obama , who continues to be dogged by conspiracy theories that suggest he himself is a Muslim ( Obama is a Christian ) , a stop at an Islamic center proved far more complicated the first seven years of his term .
