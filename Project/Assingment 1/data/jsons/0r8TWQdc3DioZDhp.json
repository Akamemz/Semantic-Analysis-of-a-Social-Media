    "content": "The U.S. and other world powers struck a historic deal with Iran on Tuesday to curb Iranian nuclear programs in exchange for relief from crushing international sanctions , an agreement that sparked dancing in the streets of Tehran , alarm in Israel and vows of a showdown in Congress with President Obama .\nAfter 18 days of intense and often fractious talks , negotiators in Vienna announced that they had reached an agreement designed to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and another U.S. military intervention in the Muslim world . The pact included late concessions by the Obama administration granting Tehran the right to object to international inspections of Iranian military sites and left unanswered questions about Iran \u2019 s past nuclear weapons activities .\nMr. Obama hailed the deal as a step toward a \u201c more hopeful world , \u201d and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said it marked \u201c a new chapter \u201d in his nation \u2019 s relations with the world . British Prime Minister David Cameron said it \u201c will help to make our world a safer place . \u201d\nIsrael said it would try to stop what it called a \u201c historic surrender . \u201d\nIn Congress , the announcement touched off objections from Republican lawmakers and some Democrats who said the deal doesn \u2019 t call for the dismantling of Iran \u2019 s nuclear facilities and doesn \u2019 t meet Mr. Obama \u2019 s stated goal of forcing Iran to submit to inspections \u201c anytime , anywhere . \u201d\nCongress now has 60 days to review the agreement , and the president has said he would veto any effort to unravel the deal . Even some opponents of the agreement conceded that Republicans would be unlikely to muster enough votes to override a veto and stop the accord .\nSEE ALSO : Hillary Clinton calls Iran deal \u2018 important step , \u2019 withholds full endorsement\nThe agreement quickly became a test in the presidential race , with Republican candidates lining up against it and some , such as Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , calling on Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to repudiate the deal . Mrs. Clinton , a former secretary of state under Mr. Obama , said as president she would be \u201c absolutely devoted to assuring the agreement is followed . \u201d\nCritics pointed out that the negotiations failed to resolve the issue of three Americans who have become Iranian prisoners : Christian missionary Saeed Abedini , journalist Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post and former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati . Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the U.S. \u201c will continue to work for their safe and their swift return . \u201d\nIn Tehran , young Iranians danced in streets and motorists honked their horns upon hearing news of the accord . Some people blew South African-style vuvuzela horns like those heard at the World Cup .\nThe accord marked a dramatic break from decades of animosity between the United States and Iran , countries that have called each other the \u201c leading state sponsor of terrorism \u201d and \u201c the Great Satan. \u201d Mr. Obama has been pushing for the agreement for years as the capstone of his diplomatic legacy , after he rallied international partners to keep economic sanctions in place to force Iran back to the negotiating table .\n\u201c This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction , \u201d Mr. Obama said in an early-morning address at the White House that was carried live on Iranian state television . \u201c We should seize it . \u201d\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement a \u201c bad mistake of historic proportion \u201d that will give Iran a \u201c sure path to nuclear weapons. \u201d He said pointedly that Israel isn \u2019 t bound by the deal .\n\u201c Wide-ranging concessions were made in all of the areas which should have prevented Iran from getting the ability to arm itself with a nuclear weapon , \u201d Mr. Netanyahu said . \u201c The desire to sign an agreement was stronger than everything else . \u201d\nMr. Kerry , who led the U.S. negotiating team , called Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s criticisms \u201c way over the top . \u201d\n\u201c Israel is safer \u201d as a result of the accord , Mr. Kerry said on MSNBC . \u201c This is under attack by people who really don \u2019 t know the terms of the agreement . \u201d\nMr. Obama tried to assure Mr. Netanyahu in a phone call that the agreement is verifiable and \u201c will remove the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran , \u201d the White House said .\nThe negotiating has been a major source of tension between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu for years , building up to the Israeli \u2019 s address to Congress in March that wasn \u2019 t sanctioned by the White House .\nSeveral Jewish-American groups came out Tuesday in opposition to the deal . The Simon Wiesenthal Center likened it to the Munich agreement in 1938 that made concessions to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler .\nSyrian President Bashar Assad , who has depended on Iran \u2019 s support while waging a brutal civil war , praised the agreement and suggested that the lifting of sanctions against Tehran would result in more aid for his regime .\n\u201c We are confident that the Islamic Republic of Iran will support , with greater drive , just causes of nations and work for peace and stability in the region and the world , \u201d Mr. Assad said in a congratulatory message to Iran \u2019 s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , published by state news agency SANA .\nSaudi Arabia \u2019 s state news agency said the kingdom warned Iran not to use money resulting from the lifting of sanctions to incite turmoil in the region . The Saudi Press Agency said Tehran must use the funds in the service of the Iranian people .\nMr. Obama dismissed skeptics who argued that Iran will cheat . He said the deal all but eliminates the possibility that Tehran could rebuild a covert nuclear weapons program .\n\u201c Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c This deal is not built on trust . It is built on verification . \u201d\nEnsuring Iran \u2019 s compliance will be a far-reaching job . The agreement calls for Tehran to reduce its number of uranium-enriching centrifuges from about 19,000 to 6,000 , cut its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and convert its heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak to use for research instead of bomb-making .\nIran currently has enough nuclear material to build at least 10 bombs , if it is enriched further to weapons grade .\nThe limits on centrifuges will be in place for 10 years , then gradually relaxed over the next three . Iran also commits to using only its current models , rather than more advanced centrifuges it hoped to install .\nIran committed to convert its Fordo enrichment site \u2014 dug deep into a mountainside and thought impervious to air attack \u2014 into a research center . The site will still house centrifuges , but they will make medical isotopes instead of enriched uranium . There will be less than one-tenth as many of these centrifuges as there originally were .\nThe agreement also calls for Tehran to give more access to its nuclear program to the U.N. nuclear agency . If that agency identifies a suspicious site , an arbitration panel with a Western majority will decide whether Iran must give inspectors access within 24 days . All sites , including military ones , may be inspected if the agency has solid evidence of undeclared nuclear activity .\nMr. Kerry said the deal \u201c will bring insight and accountability into Iran \u2019 s nuclear program . \u201d\n\u201c This is the good deal that we have sought , \u201d Mr. Kerry said , adding that the agreement \u201c also gives us the greatest assurance that we have had that Iran will not pursue a weapon covertly . \u201d\nUnder the deal , all U.S. and European Union nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended \u2014 likely beginning in a few months \u2014 after inspectors have verified that Iran is adhering to its commitments . If Iran fails to fulfill its obligations , those sanctions could \u201c snap back \u201d into place , although critics say such an effort to rebuild international consensus to reimpose economic penalties is unlikely .\nAn arms embargo against Iran will stand for five years , and restrictions on Iran \u2019 s ballistic missile programs for eight years .\nMr. Obama said the failure to reach an agreement would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East . He asked Congress to \u201c consider what happens in a world without the deal . \u201d\n\u201c We give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East . No deal means no lasting constraints on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program . The world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , was among the lawmakers speaking out against the agreement , calling it \u201c unacceptable . \u201d\n\u201c If , in fact , it \u2019 s as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment , we \u2019 ll do everything we can to stop it , \u201d Mr. Boehner said .\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas , who led 47 Republican senators in writing to Iran \u2019 s leaders to warn against a deal , called the agreement \u201c a terrible , dangerous mistake . \u201d\nSupporters of the pact included Sen.
