''\nSince Heller is the first case in which the Supreme Court explicitly recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to armed self-defense , that statement is roughly equivalent to saying , `` Trump believes Roe v.

That law , which was the strictest of its kind in the country , not only banned handguns , the most popular type of weapon for self-defense , but required that long guns be disassembled and unloaded or disabled by a trigger lock .\nAs the Court recognized , the latter rule made it impossible for D.C. residents to use even shotguns or rifles `` for the core lawful purpose of self-defense . '' But to Clinton , the D.C. ban was an eminently reasonable `` safe storage law , '' a paradigmatic example of `` commonsense '' gun control .\nIf the District 's limits on gun possession negated `` the core lawful purpose '' of the Second Amendment , you might wonder , why would a candidate who claims to respect the Second Amendment ( as Clinton intermittently does ) say they should have been upheld ? Possibly because she does not think the Second Amendment has anything to do with self-defense .\n`` I know how important gun ownership , and particularly hunting , is here in northeastern Pennsylvania , '' Clinton told supporters in Dunmore last month .

The Australian government , whose mass confiscations of firearms Clinton admires , takes a similar view .
