That \u2019 s good for Republicans , since the party out of power in the White House almost inevitably picks up House seats in the sixth year of the presidency . Heavily-gerrymandered districts provide the GOP an extra layer of protection .\nNothing short of a powerful jolt \u2014 a moment that grabs casual voters by the lapels and makes them take notice \u2014 is likely to alter the landscape in a dramatic way .
