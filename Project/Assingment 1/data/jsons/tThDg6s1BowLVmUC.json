    "content": "The brutal terrorist attack on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday has badly shaken France . But the French have reacted with a fierce determination to defend their freedoms . President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , speaking from outside the magazine \u2019 s office a couple of hours after the murder of 12 people , was crystal clear : This was an assault , he said , on \u201c the expression of freedom \u201d that is the \u201c spirit of the republic . \u201d\nTwo heavily armed attackers , who apparently knew the magazine \u2019 s staff would be gathered around a table late on Wednesday morning for a weekly editorial meeting , forced themselves into Charlie Hebdo \u2019 s office and shot 10 people dead , including the top editor and prominent cartoonists . Two policemen were also killed . At least 11 other victims were wounded . The gunmen then fled with a third accomplice in a waiting car . One of the three later surrendered to police , but the other two , who are brothers , remain at large .\nThe editors , journalists and cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo reveled in controversy and relished hitting nerves . The magazine \u2019 s editorial director , St\u00e9phane Charbonnier , who was killed in the attack , had scoffed at any suggestion that the magazine should tone down its trademark satire to appease anyone . For him , free expression was nothing without the right to offend . And Charlie Hebdo has been an equal-opportunity offender : Muslims , Jews and Christians \u2014 not to mention politicians of all stripes \u2014 have been targets of buffoonish , vulgar caricatures and cartoons that push every hot button with glee .\nIn 2006 , Charlie Hebdo reprinted controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that originally appeared in a Danish newspaper . In 2011 , the magazine \u2019 s offices were firebombed the day after it published a special issue guest-edited , it said , by Muhammad called \u201c Charia Hebdo \u201d \u2014 a play on the word in French for Shariah law .
