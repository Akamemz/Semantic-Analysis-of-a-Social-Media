    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : It was supposed to be a relatively simple part of preparing for the coronavirus in the United States \u2014 testing for it . My colleague Sheri Fink on what went wrong . It \u2019 s Wednesday , March 11 .\nSo in 2018 , it was the hundredth anniversary of the terrible 1918 flu pandemic . This was called the Spanish flu . And it just killed millions and millions of people around the world . So on that hundredth-year anniversary , many gatherings were held to discuss the lessons of that flu pandemic for today . And there was this one gathering of high-level people in Atlanta , Georgia , where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is based . And among the officials there was a group from the National Security Council . It had actually been created , a special unit on global health security that was created after that terrible Ebola outbreak in West Africa .\nSo one of the officials with that group , with that unit \u2014\narchived recording ( luciano borio ) Well , it \u2019 s a pleasure to be here with so many of my colleagues . And we \u2019 ve been working together for more than a decade on these issues .\n\u2014 she steps up to the podium and she says \u2014\narchived recording ( luciano borio ) The threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern . We know that it can not be stopped at the border .\nSo this is a pretty senior health official on the National Security Council warning her colleagues that there is a very predictable threat here \u2014 a pandemic flu and \u2014\narchived recording ( luciano borio ) Are we ready to respond to a pandemic ? I fear the answer is no .\n\u2014 in her words , the country is just not really ready for it . So we should do something about it .\nExactly . And as it happens , the very next day , that global health security unit where she worked was shut down by a senior member of the Trump administration . So fast forward two years . And it \u2019 s early January , January 3 . It \u2019 s a Friday . And the secretary of health and human services , Alex Azar , is at home in Washington . And he gets this phone call from Robert Redfield , this doctor who \u2019 s the head of the C.D.C . And Dr. Redfield tells Azar about these reports coming out of China , that there are these clusters of pneumonia cases , and that the likely culprit is a new coronavirus . And Alex Azar , the health and human services secretary , says , this is a very big deal .\nAnd what does Azar do with this information and this understanding that whatever this is , it \u2019 s going to be a big deal ?\nThe Trump administration officials start meeting every day in the basement of the West Wing . And so at first , they say , OK , let \u2019 s screen the flights that are coming from China . But there \u2019 s an even more serious question that comes up , which is , should we ban flights altogether ? And should we deny entry to anybody who has come from China in the last 14 days , to anybody who isn \u2019 t a citizen or a permanent resident here ? So then that debate got shifted right to the Oval Office . And the top health officials of the nation , at that point , were agreed . A ban from traveling from the center of this epidemic could buy us some time , could help us to prepare ourselves before this came . It could slow that down . The president asked , what could the consequences be on the economy ? All logical things that you would probably ask . In the end , he sided with the aides who supported the idea that this could actually help protect our nation \u2019 s health . The problem was we weren \u2019 t completely prepared . Our government wasn \u2019 t completely prepared to use that time .\nThe biggest issue that the government had to face was testing \u2014 being able to diagnose somebody who has this illness .\nAnd what is the problem with testing at this point ?\nWell , it didn \u2019 t seem like there would be a problem . Even though it was a new virus , the Chinese quickly made the sequence of it available . And labs were really quickly able to create a test for that , including the World Health Organization had already approved a test that was developed by some German scientists . But the U.S. , which considers the C.D.C the world \u2019 s premier public health agency , they decided to make their own test . But it didn \u2019 t actually get F.D.A . approved until the first week of February . And at that point , it could be distributed to public health laboratories across the country . But , you know , now we \u2019 re already over a month into this scary new outbreak by that point .\nSo this is already off to a pretty slow start at a moment where every single day counts .\nThat \u2019 s right . So now , we \u2019 re like a month into this thing . And they \u2019 re finally able to mail out the kits to public health laboratories around the country \u2014 state health laboratories , some big city health laboratories , this network of labs that our public health system has . And the next day \u2014 the first step that the labs have to do is they have to check that test . They have to what \u2019 s called \u201c validate it , \u201d make sure it \u2019 s working . And right that next day , the C.D.C starts getting reports from some of these public health labs , saying , we \u2019 re not able to validate this test . We \u2019 re having problems . We \u2019 re getting some inconclusive results . And that \u2019 s the first sign that something may have gone wrong .\nWell , the C.D.C says it was definitely working in their lab . So they \u2019 ve told all the labs across the country , if it \u2019 s not working for you , of course , don \u2019 t use it . Just send samples to us . Of course , that adds time . You have to collect a sample in your local area and then send it to Atlanta , and then wait for that result to come back .\nSo what impact does this testing snafu have at this point on our understanding of the epidemic ?\nIt just means that we don \u2019 t know . We actually don \u2019 t know . We say we have a low number of cases in this country at that point . But if you don \u2019 t test , how can you know ?\nOK. And for these weeks where it seemed like we had cases in the low double digits in the United States , and there was a sense that things were quite stable and the danger was pretty low , the virus very well could have been spreading and spreading widely , and we wouldn \u2019 t have known . Because we weren \u2019 t doing the testing that would have told us that .\nExactly . And here \u2019 s why . Because only a small proportion of people who get the virus get really , really sick , fortunately . But by the time that they get into a critical care bed at a hospital \u2014 and the doctors there are scratching their heads , and they \u2019 ve tested for all the known things that cause like pneumonia and severe , severe respiratory distress \u2014 weeks have gone by since that person was infected . So you \u2019 re actually looking at history . If you finally get a positive test at that point , then , yes , it has been spreading in the community . And that \u2019 s all that time that you lose .\nRight . So this time that the Trump administration had bought the American people with that dramatic step \u2014 with shutting its border to Chinese travelers \u2014 is kind of being squandered .\nYeah , there were so many people who were starting to feel , at this point , like this time is being squandered . And we needed to get eyes on this . There were travelers coming from parts of the world where we didn \u2019 t have a travel ban that now had a large number of cases . And they weren \u2019 t being screened at the airports . They were going out into the communities . And there was just this urgency of being able to test more . And that \u2019 s when this one group of doctors and researchers took matters into their own hands .\n[ phone dialing ] helen chu Hello ? This is Helen . sheri fink Hi , Helen . How are you doing ? helen chu I \u2019 m doing well . How are you ? sheri fink I \u2019 m well . Thanks .\nShe \u2019 s a physician and a researcher in Washington state , which is where the first case of coronavirus was detected in the U.S. back in January . And she and her colleagues see a potential solution to this testing problem in their own work .\nhelen chu We had a study in place that was set up for detection of respiratory viral illnesses in the community \u2014\nShe specializes in studying how viruses pass from person-to-person within that same community . And she and her colleagues have this big study where they \u2019 re collecting all these samples .\nhelen chu \u2014 from people who are sick , and then testing them in the lab for flu and other respiratory viruses .\nAnd through collecting hundreds and hundreds of samples every week , they \u2019 re trying to track the spread of viruses .\nAnd she was in the middle of collecting samples when the coronavirus arrives in Washington ?\nSo we had this infrastructure in place already , essentially , in the Seattle area to be able to detect early entry of a virus into the city and then to understand how it spread .\nAnd that sounds like it would make her very well positioned to do the same thing for the coronavirus .\nExactly . She thought of that . The state health officials knew about their project . And they immediately thought about the potential of this project to help with this issue of testing .\nThey make their own coronavirus test really fast . And they \u2019 re ready to go to help the state by the first week of February . But there \u2019 s one hitch .\nhelen chu We had to go through regulatory clearance , essentially . We had to talk to C.D.C . We had to talk to F.D.A ..\nThey don \u2019 t have the approval to test and then give those results out for two reasons . One is they \u2019 re not a clinical lab , so they don \u2019 t have the regulatory approval for that . And number two is they \u2019 ve just created this new coronavirus test , which isn \u2019 t yet F.D.A . approved .\nhelen chu And so we were at a point where we could test thousands and thousands of samples at very high throughput . But we didn \u2019 t know what to do when we found a positive .\nSo there \u2019 s good reason to have some of those regulations in place . But they figure , this is a public health emergency . And they feel like there \u2019 s got to be some way around this bureaucratic red tape , where they could at least screen these samples and get that information out to the public health authorities to confirm that test , whatever it is . But \u2014\nhelen chu Everybody felt very hesitant about us being able to provide results or to do the testing at all .\n\u2014 the C.D.C doesn \u2019 t seem to find a way around it . Weeks go by . And they \u2019 re getting more and more frustrated . And they \u2019 re seeing the outbreak is growing in China , and it \u2019 s spreading to other countries . So we know there \u2019 s a potential for it to be an outbreak not just in China .\nhelen chu We had the information . We had the data there sitting in our lab where we could actually answer the question . And that was frustrating , that we could answer it . We had the capacity to answer it , but we couldn \u2019 t move forward , because we didn \u2019 t know what to do .\nThey feel like they \u2019 re sitting on a gold mine . And they feel like the virus very well could be out there . After all , there had been this case in Washington state more than a month earlier , and nobody \u2019 s had eyes on it . Nobody \u2019 s been doing surveillance in the community , testing samples . So they \u2019 re getting more and more nervous . Is there something we \u2019 re not seeing ? Because we \u2019 re not really testing very widely .\nSo what did they end up doing ? Just kind of keeping those samples on ice and doing nothing ?\nWell , at first , that \u2019 s what they did . Because they thought they could speak with these officials and find out some official workaround , so that they wouldn \u2019 t be violating regulations and get in trouble .\nhelen chu Everyone wanted to be able to do this the proper way \u2014 to go through C.D.C and state labs and have them have the high capacity to do the testing of all of these patients who really needed a diagnosis . But it just couldn \u2019 t be done .\nAnd then it gets to February 25 . I mean , the month is almost gone . It \u2019 s more than a month since that first case . And they finally just said \u2014\nhelen chu What we would do is move forward with research testing only .\n\u2014 we \u2019 re going to start using this unapproved coronavirus test that we have , and that we believe is very reliable , and start testing these samples .\nWell , they \u2019 re just going for it . And technically , they can test , right ? But the issue is , they can \u2019 t report the results .\nhelen chu So what we would do would just be to go ahead and test the samples for coronavirus , but not to associate that with the information from the sample . So the clinical information .\nSo they have a plan to test for the coronavirus . And if they find it , that would mean that they \u2019 re sitting on information that they \u2019 re not supposed to have .\nThey \u2019 re sitting on information that they \u2019 re not supposed to communicate because of these regulatory issues . It \u2019 s all going to be fine as long as they don \u2019 t find a case .\nOK , so once they decided to do that , what happened ?\nWhat happened was , one of the very first days that they started testing \u2014\nhelen chu What I thought was , oh , no . If it came up that early in our testing , that meant that it had probably been here for a while and that we just didn \u2019 t know that it was there . And so the questions racing through my head at that point where , what is the right thing to do right now ? And so what happened at that point was that we rapidly convened a meeting of the investigators .\nThe group just convenes . They all get on the phone . And they talk about ethics at this point .\nhelen chu We talked through the ethics of the different options \u2014 keep it to ourselves , tell public health , or tell the participants . And what we are allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves . But what we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health . And so that \u2019 s what we did .\nThey decide that the most ethical thing is to report the result to the local health authority . They confirmed the result . And it \u2019 s this local teenager in the very same county as that first positive case , but no known link to that person and no travel history . And that next morning , the public health lab went out and they found this teenager , who was feeling better by that point . Because he had had a mild form of this illness , which is most common , especially in young people . And they get to him just after he walks into his school , because he \u2019 s \u2014\nYeah . And they end up shutting the school down to make sure that nobody else will catch the virus .\nhelen chu I mean , that was a good moment for our team , I thought . You know , we did something that didn \u2019 t follow the rules , but we were able to prevent spread in a high school . And that seemed really important .\nSo because of the doctor \u2019 s actions , they catch him , basically , in the nick of time .\nThey do . And they also realize that they may have a big problem on their hands . Because if this case descended from that first case , if that person potentially had infected somebody without knowing it , and then there was mild illness going on , and nobody caught it , there could be hundreds of cases in the area . And so that gave them the information that they needed to start acting , to start looking more seriously for the virus in the community .\nI wonder . Had Dr. Chu not broken the rules in this case , how that would have changed how we understand the coronavirus in the Seattle region ?\nWell , we wouldn \u2019 t have known , until the people started dying , that there was a problem . And unfortunately , the really sad thing is that that happened really soon after that . And so if Dr. Chu and her colleagues had been able to test sooner , they would have been able to alert the authorities earlier . And that \u2019 s the real tragedy here .\nSheri , on the one hand , the story that you have just told \u2014 it \u2019 s a pretty heroic story of a doctor willing to go against the rules , the instructions , because she felt that it was needed in the moment , in the midst of a public health crisis . On the other hand , it feels risky for the lesson here to be that medical professionals should go rogue in the middle of a crisis . I mean , what in your mind is the lesson here ?\nI mean , I \u2019 m somebody who \u2019 s reported on disasters for many years and used to do some disaster response myself . And I \u2019 ve always seen in crises that thinking outside the box can really solve problems and it can save lives . And I think we generally accept that already , that the rules do have to bend , that people need to think creatively . And one of the reasons they have to do it \u2014 and it was so evident here \u2014 was that the larger system , the official responders , the official system in place couldn \u2019 t do everything and was faltering .\nBut I wonder , how much would things potentially have been different , Sheri , if , thinking back to the start of our conversation , those government programs \u2014 the National Security Council \u2019 s health program , for example \u2014 hadn \u2019 t been cut ? I mean , how much does that reflect an overall approach to this epidemic from the people currently in charge from the Trump administration ?\nI think you can trace it back further than that . It is a pattern that these programs , when there \u2019 s a crisis , they get really well funded . And as soon as Ebola recedes into history , we start cutting those parts of government . You can look back after the anthrax attacks and 9/11 . And there was all this money that went into bioterrorism preparedness and hospital preparedness . And then you look at the numbers , and they go down over time . This is a reaction of humanity and society and government , is to sort of like \u2014 when it \u2019 s in the news and it \u2019 s fresh in our minds , we invest in it , and then we turn away . So I feel like this is a pattern . And when this happens , and we have these gaps in our preparedness that the government always seems to have , what I have found over and over again as a reporter is regular people step in and fill some of those holes . And I \u2019 m thinking \u2014 right now I have this image of Hurricane Katrina and government officials not being able to rescue everybody who needed help all at once . People waving towels off of rooftops and people stuck in hospitals . And then it was these regular people who had airboats , who were fishermen from western Louisiana . And they show up , and they just take people to dry ground . I \u2019 ve seen examples like that over and over . In this case , we saw Dr. Chu and her colleagues doing something like that . But , what I found out today on the phone with Dr. Chu was that \u2014\nhelen chu Yesterday , the Washington state regulators called their lab and asked us to shut down .\n\u2014 the project got shut down again . So the state regulators told them they can \u2019 t keep doing this . So it looks like the government isn \u2019 t going to allow this to continue to fill that hole . And so that hole remains .\nThe question is whether this will be one of those lessons that comes out of this particular outbreak . And of course , there will be a tomorrow . There will be a day where we \u2019 re not in the midst of something so frightening that we \u2019 re in right now . And the question is , will this fit that same cycle where we say , we \u2019 ve learned the lesson , we need to kind of innovate and come up with new systems that will ensure that we \u2019 re on a better footing , that we can have some backup system so that we can roll out testing as a country much more quickly ? Or will this fit that same cycle , where once the immediate danger goes away , we stop investing , or we just forget ?\nA few days ago , my colleague Peter Baker asked President Trump whether he regrets eliminating the global health unit of the National Security Council in light of the coronavirus epidemic .\ndonald trump I just think this is something , Peter , that you can never really think is going to happen . I \u2019 ve heard all about , this could be a big deal , from before it happened . Something like this could happen .\nThe president claimed , despite past warnings from federal health officials , that such an epidemic was previously unimaginable .\ndonald trump But who would have thought ? Look , how long ago was it ? Six , seven , eight weeks ago , who would have thought we \u2019 d even be having this subject ? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow like it was clockwork , right ?\nHere \u2019 s what else you need to know today . On Tuesday , public and private institutions across the United States took their strongest measures yet to limit the spread of the coronavirus . Dozens of colleges and universities , from the University of California , Berkeley to Harvard , are closing their doors or asking students to attend classes remotely . Major airlines , including Delta and American Airlines , said they would drastically cut back on international flights . And the nursing home industry issued a recommendation to bar visits from family and friends after deadly outbreaks inside of five nursing homes around Seattle . In New York , officials have created a containment cell around the source of a major outbreak in the city of New Rochelle , north of New York City , ordering schools , community centers and houses of worship within the zone to close for the next two weeks and deploying the National Guard inside the containment area . And in California , a cruise ship with at least 21 infected passengers docked in Oakland , where it was met by workers in protective gear , who took those on board to a nearby military base in the largest quarantine operation so far on American soil . For the results of Tuesday night \u2019 s Democratic primaries , which were held in six states , listen to this morning \u2019 s episode of \u201c The Latest. \u201d You can find it on \u201c The Daily \u201d feed or by searching for \u201c The Latest , \u201d wherever you listen .",

And we needed to get eyes on this. There were travelers coming from parts of the world where we didn\u2019t have a travel ban that now had a large number of cases. And they weren\u2019t being screened at the airports. They were going out into the communities. And there was just this urgency of being able to test more. And that\u2019s when this one group of doctors and researchers took matters into their own hands.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSheri, who is this doctor?\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo her name is Helen Chu.\n\n[phone dialing] helen chu Hello? This is Helen. sheri fink Hi, Helen. How are you doing? helen chu I\u2019m doing well. How are you? sheri fink I\u2019m well. Thanks.\n\nsheri fink\n\nShe\u2019s a physician and a researcher in Washington state, which is where the first case of coronavirus was detected in the U.S. back in January. And she and her colleagues see a potential solution to this testing problem in their own work.\n\nhelen chu We had a study in place that was set up for detection of respiratory viral illnesses in the community \u2014\n\nsheri fink\n\nShe specializes in studying how viruses pass from person-to-person within that same community. And she and her colleagues have this big study where they\u2019re collecting all these samples.\n\nhelen chu \u2014 from people who are sick, and then testing them in the lab for flu and other respiratory viruses.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd through collecting hundreds and hundreds of samples every week, they\u2019re trying to track the spread of viruses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she was in the middle of collecting samples when the coronavirus arrives in Washington?\n\nsheri fink\n\nThat is right.\n\nhelen chu\n\nSo we had this infrastructure in place already, essentially, in the Seattle area to be able to detect early entry of a virus into the city and then to understand how it spread.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd that sounds like it would make her very well positioned to do the same thing for the coronavirus.\n\nsheri fink\n\nExactly. She thought of that. The state health officials knew about their project. And they immediately thought about the potential of this project to help with this issue of testing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what happens?\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey make their own coronavirus test really fast. And they\u2019re ready to go to help the state by the first week of February. But there\u2019s one hitch.\n\nhelen chu We had to go through regulatory clearance, essentially. We had to talk to C.D.C. We had to talk to F.D.A..\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey don\u2019t have the approval to test and then give those results out for two reasons. One is they\u2019re not a clinical lab, so they don\u2019t have the regulatory approval for that. And number two is they\u2019ve just created this new coronavirus test, which isn\u2019t yet F.D.A. approved.\n\nhelen chu And so we were at a point where we could test thousands and thousands of samples at very high throughput. But we didn\u2019t know what to do when we found a positive.\n\nsheri fink\n\nSo there\u2019s good reason to have some of those regulations in place. But they figure, this is a public health emergency. And they feel like there\u2019s got to be some way around this bureaucratic red tape, where they could at least screen these samples and get that information out to the public health authorities to confirm that test, whatever it is. But \u2014\n\nhelen chu Everybody felt very hesitant about us being able to provide results or to do the testing at all.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 the C.D.C doesn\u2019t seem to find a way around it. Weeks go by. And they\u2019re getting more and more frustrated. And they\u2019re seeing the outbreak is growing in China, and it\u2019s spreading to other countries. So we know there\u2019s a potential for it to be an outbreak not just in China.\n\nhelen chu We had the information. We had the data there sitting in our lab where we could actually answer the question. And that was frustrating, that we could answer it. We had the capacity to answer it, but we couldn\u2019t move forward, because we didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey feel like they\u2019re sitting on a gold mine. And they feel like the virus very well could be out there. After all, there had been this case in Washington state more than a month earlier, and nobody\u2019s had eyes on it. Nobody\u2019s been doing surveillance in the community, testing samples. So they\u2019re getting more and more nervous. Is there something we\u2019re not seeing? Because we\u2019re not really testing very widely.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what did they end up doing? Just kind of keeping those samples on ice and doing nothing?\n\nsheri fink\n\nWell, at first, that\u2019s what they did. Because they thought they could speak with these officials and find out some official workaround, so that they wouldn\u2019t be violating regulations and get in trouble.\n\nhelen chu Everyone wanted to be able to do this the proper way \u2014 to go through C.D.C and state labs and have them have the high capacity to do the testing of all of these patients who really needed a diagnosis. But it just couldn\u2019t be done.\n\nsheri fink\n\nAnd then it gets to February 25. I mean, the month is almost gone. It\u2019s more than a month since that first case. And they finally just said \u2014\n\nhelen chu What we would do is move forward with research testing only.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 we\u2019re going to start using this unapproved coronavirus test that we have, and that we believe is very reliable, and start testing these samples.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So they\u2019re just going for it?\n\nsheri fink\n\nWell, they\u2019re just going for it. And technically, they can test, right? But the issue is, they can\u2019t report the results.\n\nhelen chu So what we would do would just be to go ahead and test the samples for coronavirus, but not to associate that with the information from the sample. So the clinical information.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo they have a plan to test for the coronavirus. And if they find it, that would mean that they\u2019re sitting on information that they\u2019re not supposed to have.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey\u2019re sitting on information that they\u2019re not supposed to communicate because of these regulatory issues. It\u2019s all going to be fine as long as they don\u2019t find a case.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so once they decided to do that, what happened?\n\nsheri fink\n\nWhat happened was, one of the very first days that they started testing \u2014\n\nhelen chu February 27, we got the first positive.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 they found a case.\n\nhelen chu What I thought was, oh, no. If it came up that early in our testing, that meant that it had probably been here for a while and that we just didn\u2019t know that it was there. And so the questions racing through my head at that point where, what is the right thing to do right now? And so what happened at that point was that we rapidly convened a meeting of the investigators.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThe group just convenes. They all get on the phone. And they talk about ethics at this point.\n\nhelen chu We talked through the ethics of the different options \u2014 keep it to ourselves, tell public health, or tell the participants. And what we are allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves. But what we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health. And so that\u2019s what we did.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey decide that the most ethical thing is to report the result to the local health authority. They confirmed the result. And it\u2019s this local teenager in the very same county as that first positive case, but no known link to that person and no travel history. And that next morning, the public health lab went out and they found this teenager, who was feeling better by that point. Because he had had a mild form of this illness, which is most common, especially in young people. And they get to him just after he walks into his school, because he\u2019s \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOh, wow.\n\nsheri fink\n\nYeah. And they end up shutting the school down to make sure that nobody else will catch the virus.\n\nhelen chu I mean, that was a good moment for our team, I thought. You know, we did something that didn\u2019t follow the rules, but we were able to prevent spread in a high school. And that seemed really important.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo because of the doctor\u2019s actions, they catch him, basically, in the nick of time.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThey do. And they also realize that they may have a big problem on their hands. Because if this case descended from that first case, if that person potentially had infected somebody without knowing it, and then there was mild illness going on, and nobody caught it, there could be hundreds of cases in the area. And so that gave them the information that they needed to start acting, to start looking more seriously for the virus in the community.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder. Had Dr. Chu not broken the rules in this case, how that would have changed how we understand the coronavirus in the Seattle region?\n\nsheri fink\n\nWell, we wouldn\u2019t have known, until the people started dying, that there was a problem. And unfortunately, the really sad thing is that that happened really soon after that. And so if Dr. Chu and her colleagues had been able to test sooner, they would have been able to alert the authorities earlier. And that\u2019s the real tragedy here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSheri, on the one hand, the story that you have just told \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty heroic story of a doctor willing to go against the rules, the instructions, because she felt that it was needed in the moment, in the midst of a public health crisis. On the other hand, it feels risky for the lesson here to be that medical professionals should go rogue in the middle of a crisis. I mean, what in your mind is the lesson here?\n\nsheri fink\n\nI mean, I\u2019m somebody who\u2019s reported on disasters for many years and used to do some disaster response myself. And I\u2019ve always seen in crises that thinking outside the box can really solve problems and it can save lives. And I think we generally accept that already, that the rules do have to bend, that people need to think creatively. And one of the reasons they have to do it \u2014 and it was so evident here \u2014 was that the larger system, the official responders, the official system in place couldn\u2019t do everything and was faltering.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut I wonder, how much would things potentially have been different, Sheri, if, thinking back to the start of our conversation, those government programs \u2014 the National Security Council\u2019s health program, for example \u2014 hadn\u2019t been cut? I mean, how much does that reflect an overall approach to this epidemic from the people currently in charge from the Trump administration?\n\nsheri fink\n\nI think you can trace it back further than that. It is a pattern that these programs, when there\u2019s a crisis, they get really well funded. And as soon as Ebola recedes into history, we start cutting those parts of government. You can look back after the anthrax attacks and 9/11. And there was all this money that went into bioterrorism preparedness and hospital preparedness. And then you look at the numbers, and they go down over time. This is a reaction of humanity and society and government, is to sort of like \u2014 when it\u2019s in the news and it\u2019s fresh in our minds, we invest in it, and then we turn away. So I feel like this is a pattern. And when this happens, and we have these gaps in our preparedness that the government always seems to have, what I have found over and over again as a reporter is regular people step in and fill some of those holes. And I\u2019m thinking \u2014 right now I have this image of Hurricane Katrina and government officials not being able to rescue everybody who needed help all at once. People waving towels off of rooftops and people stuck in hospitals. And then it was these regular people who had airboats, who were fishermen from western Louisiana. And they show up, and they just take people to dry ground. I\u2019ve seen examples like that over and over. In this case, we saw Dr. Chu and her colleagues doing something like that. But, what I found out today on the phone with Dr. Chu was that \u2014\n\nhelen chu Yesterday, the Washington state regulators called their lab and asked us to shut down.\n\nsheri fink\n\n\u2014 the project got shut down again. So the state regulators told them they can\u2019t keep doing this. So it looks like the government isn\u2019t going to allow this to continue to fill that hole. And so that hole remains.\n\n[music]\n\nsheri fink\n\nThe question is whether this will be one of those lessons that comes out of this particular outbreak. And of course, there will be a tomorrow. There will be a day where we\u2019re not in the midst of something so frightening that we\u2019re in right now. And the question is, will this fit that same cycle where we say, we\u2019ve learned the lesson, we need to kind of innovate and come up with new systems that will ensure that we\u2019re on a better footing, that we can have some backup system so that we can roll out testing as a country much more quickly? Or will this fit that same cycle, where once the immediate danger goes away, we stop investing, or we just forget?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSheri, thank you.\n\nsheri fink\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA few days ago, my colleague Peter Baker asked President Trump whether he regrets eliminating the global health unit of the National Security Council in light of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\ndonald trump I just think this is something, Peter, that you can never really think is going to happen. I\u2019ve heard all about, this could be a big deal, from before it happened. Something like this could happen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe president claimed, despite past warnings from federal health officials, that such an epidemic was previously unimaginable.\n\ndonald trump But who would have thought? Look, how long ago was it? Six, seven, eight weeks ago, who would have thought we\u2019d even be having this subject? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow like it was clockwork, right?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, public and private institutions across the United States took their strongest measures yet to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Dozens of colleges and universities, from the University of California, Berkeley to Harvard, are closing their doors or asking students to attend classes remotely. Major airlines, including Delta and American Airlines, said they would drastically cut back on international flights. And the nursing home industry issued a recommendation to bar visits from family and friends after deadly outbreaks inside of five nursing homes around Seattle. In New York, officials have created a containment cell around the source of a major outbreak in the city of New Rochelle, north of New York City, ordering schools, community centers and houses of worship within the zone to close for the next two weeks and deploying the National Guard inside the containment area. And in California, a cruise ship with at least 21 infected passengers docked in Oakland, where it was met by workers in protective gear, who took those on board to a nearby military base in the largest quarantine operation so far on American soil.
