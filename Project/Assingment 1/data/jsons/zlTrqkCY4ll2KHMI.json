    "content": "Will Marshall is the president of the Progressive Policy Institute .\nFor all the roller coaster drama of the battle to control the Senate , the midterm elections won \u2019 t really change much . No matter which party ends up with a majority , Americans will still wake up on Nov. 5 to a seemingly immutable stalemate in Washington . But pragmatic progressives should take heart . Over the next two years they have an historic opportunity : to build a broad center-left majority that can break the paralyzing grip of polarization and get America moving forward again .\nNot so long ago , U.S. politicians who robotically toed the party line were considered shameless hacks . And ideologues were seen as wingnuts\u2014self-righteous cranks unable to cope with life \u2019 s complexities . Today , such people dominate our national politics . How are they doing ? If the measure is simplifying and sharpening dueling political narratives , they are doing a fine job . If it is governing , they are failing miserably .\nThe more polarized our politics , it seems , the less productive our government . In this sense , polarization serves conservative rather than progressive ends . If you hate government , you probably don \u2019 t mind that Washington has degenerated into Fight Club . Conservatives come to fight liberal schemes to enlarge government ; liberals come to fight conservative schemes to succor the rich and screw everyone else . And the fight is what matters , not getting things done , because the fight is how you raise money , energize supporters and get media attention . Compared with the give and take of governing , partisan combat is easy , because you never have to think independently , face inconvenient facts or accomplish anything more than keep the other side down . Plus , you get to pose as a paragon of deep conviction .\nIn this Manichean hothouse , the battle lines are clear and everyone knows their place . To break ranks on any major issue is treason , to see merit in the other side \u2019 s point of view is heresy , to compromise is to sell out and to engage in political horse-trading is corrupt . Finding common ground ? That \u2019 s so 20th century . Don \u2019 t bore us with intellectual honesty , nuance or shades of grey\u2014just pick a side , slug it out and let the best team win .\nSuch are the new rules of political competition in the Polarized States of America . There \u2019 s just one hitch : They clash with the basic design of our democracy . Winner-take-all outcomes are better suited to parliamentary systems . When a party wins a parliamentary majority , it is expected to enact its platform unilaterally or with minor party partners . America \u2019 s political operating system is different : With three separate and distinct branches of government , our constitutional frame is rife with divided powers , checks and balances and constraints on majority rule .\nOur system is intended , in other words , to thwart just what today \u2019 s polarizers dream of : imposing their philosophy in all its undiluted glory on the nation . The Founders , who really were wise in these matters , didn \u2019 t trust what they called political \u201c factions \u201d to wield that much power . \u201c Great innovations , \u201d warned Thomas Jefferson , \u201c should not be forced on slender majorities. \u201d Our political system isn \u2019 t supposed to produce ideological coherence ; it \u2019 s geared to yield outcomes that balance competing values and interests , and in consequence are broadly accepted as fair and legitimate . Our system is built for pragmatists . And absent the pragmatist \u2019 s values\u2014power-sharing , the willingness to compromise , regard for minority rights and some measure of comity between the branches and parties\u2014our democracy doesn \u2019 t work very well .\nThe Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) is an exception that proves the rule . In 2010 , Democrats resorted to an unusual legislative tactic , budget reconciliation , to pass the law without a single Republican vote . Since then the GOP has waged an obsessive campaign to demonize \u201c Obamacare \u201d as a naked partisan power grab\u2014even though their mean-spirited refusal to offer a serious alternative for covering the uninsured forced the majority \u2019 s hand . So while the ACA is a landmark achievement , as a strictly partisan one it rests on a wobbly political foundation . Most voters say they oppose the law , and conservative legal challenges are working their way through the courts . Should they win a Senate majority this year , Republicans say they \u2019 ll exact payback by using reconciliation to kill or nullify the law .\nThe GOP \u2019 s implacable hatred of Obamacare also underscores an oft-noted fact about polarization : It is asymmetrical . Surveys confirm what impartial observers of U.S. politics can readily observe : Republicans are more ideologically extreme and more stridently partisan than Democrats . Conservatives also are significantly less interested than liberals in political compromise . Under the sway of a new breed of anti-government zealots , the GOP is chiefly responsible for blocking action on some of the most pressing issues we face , from tax and fiscal reform to immigration and climate change .\nThe Democrats aren \u2019 t blameless . Many liberals , for example , are just as theologically opposed to modernizing entitlements as conservatives are to raising taxes . The result of this demagogic stance is anything but progressive . It means Washington will continue to direct a growing share of the country \u2019 s resources to seniors while starving investment in children and families and future growth .\nIn any case , Democrats have been moving steadily to the left , about as fast but not nearly as far as Republicans have shifted rightwards . The share of Democrats holding consistently liberal views , for example , has quadrupled from 5 percent in 1994 to 23 percent today . This leftward movement is a big problem for the party . If Democrats follow the GOP into the fever swamps of ideological purity , the nation \u2019 s political crisis will only grow deeper . Absent a fundamental and highly improbable revamping of our constitutional system , America can \u2019 t be governed from either ideological pole . Only by leading from the pragmatic center can Democrats capitalize on GOP extremism and rally broad public support behind new ideas for breaking the partisan log jam in Washington .\nUnfortunately , such problem-solving pragmatism is currently out of fashion . Actually , it \u2019 s worse than that : Politicians who try to break the partisan impasse risk self-immolation . A Republican who reaches out to Democrats on immigration or some other highly charged issue risks being \u201c primaried \u201d and mauled by political goon squads with gobs of money , like the Club for Growth , Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action . When even powerful GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell and Eric Cantor are attacked by the right as squishes , you know the conservative revolution has begun to devour its own .\nPressure to conform is mounting on the other side , too .
