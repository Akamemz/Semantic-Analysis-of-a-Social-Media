Clinton 's strong performance in several states in Tuesday 's primaries erased essentially any path to the nomination for Sanders .\n`` I look forward to meeting with [ Clinton ] in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump , '' Sanders said , adding that he had congratulated Clinton on her `` very strong campaign '' after voting on Tuesday .\n`` What they said in the beginning is that they would not put their thumb on the scales , and they kept their word , '' Sanders said . `` I appreciate that very , very much . ''\nPerhaps most important is what Sanders did not say at the news conference : that he 'll be lobbying the superdelegates to overturn the will of the voters and grant him the nomination . In his brief remarks , Sanders also did n't criticize Clinton or try to point out her flaws as a potential nominee , as he has on the stump recently . And when he spoke about the Democratic convention , he spoke about it in terms of `` issues , '' not an attempt to win the nomination .\nTrue to form , Sanders argued that Washington , DC , should be granted statehood and representatives in the US Senate ( a position Clinton shares ) .
