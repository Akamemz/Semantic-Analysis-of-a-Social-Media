    "content": "In Rose Garden remarks , Trump alleged that the Chinese government covered up the coronavirus outbreak and instigated `` a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over 1 million lives worldwide. \u201d The president also attacked the World Health Organization as effectively controlled by Beijing .\n\u201c We will today be terminating our relationship \u201d with the WHO , the president said , adding that the organization \u2019 s more than $ 400 million annual U.S. contribution will be diverted to other health groups .\nThe president later issued a proclamation to protect sensitive American university research from Chinese spying and to bar an unspecified number of Chinese nationals from entering the United States for graduate study . He also directed an administration working group headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to evaluate Chinese corporations listed on U.S. financial markets as potential targets of future restrictions .\nThe moves seemed certain to intensify growing U.S.-China tensions , though investors on Friday took them in stride .\nThe president \u2019 s comments were as notable for what he did not say . There was no mention of his irritation with China \u2019 s failure to quickly increase purchases of American goods as required by the trade deal he signed in January . He also made no direct reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping , even as he said \u201c the world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government . \u201d\nIn one sign of Trump \u2019 s increased fury with the world \u2019 s second-largest economy , on Friday morning he tweeted simply : \u201c CHINA ! \u201d\nHis formal Friday announcement \u2014 while long on harsh rhetoric \u2014 was short on details . The president reiterated some familiar grievances , blaming the Chinese for stealing American trade secrets and jobs and assailing his predecessors for allegedly letting them get away with it .\nHe expanded his indictment of the Chinese government to include its program of island construction in the South China Sea , a national security concern he rarely addresses .\n\u201c The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many nations , \u201d he said .\nTrump also stopped short of taking concrete action against the U.S.-listed Chinese companies he said posed \u201c hidden and undue risks \u201d for American investors . The Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators have complained for years about China \u2019 s refusal to grant access to their companies \u2019 audit records .\nAs of last year , 156 Chinese companies \u2014 including 11 with significant government ownership \u2014 traded on U.S. markets , according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission , a nonpartisan congressional body .\nAfter Trump \u2019 s remarks , Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

The only question is whether President Trump is afraid to lead or just doesn \u2019 t know how . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s announcement followed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2019 s statement earlier this week that Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to deserve separate treatment . Under the 1997 handover agreement with the United Kingdom , China agreed to preserve the former British colony \u2019 s democratic system for 50 years . Xi \u2019 s decision to impose security legislation on Hong Kong directly rather than by working through the territory \u2019 s local legislature may mark the collapse of that \u201c one country , two systems \u201d approach .\nSome advocates of a tougher U.S. approach to China were disappointed by the president \u2019 s 10-minute statement .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t do anything with regard to Hong Kong . His Hong Kong comments could have been issued as a statement a week ago , \u201d said Derek Scissors , a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute . \u201c The administration has absolutely considered specific actions since the NPC proposal was made public but decided not to announce a single one . \u201d\nCaught in the middle of the deepening U.S.-China dispute are more than 1,350 U.S. corporations with offices in Hong Kong . The erosion of the city \u2019 s freedoms , including an independent judiciary , threatens to turn one of the global economy \u2019 s financial centers into just another Chinese city and calls into question the rationale for such a sizable commercial presence there .\nThe Chinese National People \u2019 s Congress , the country \u2019 s rubber-stamp legislature , on Thursday approved a plan to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong . The move was denounced in a joint statement by the United States , Canada , Australia and United Kingdom as in \u201c direct conflict \u201d with China \u2019 s promises in 1997 when it regained sovereignty over the former British colony .\n\u201c The United States may well have to do something the market doesn \u2019 t like in light of its longer-term interests , \u201d said Patrick Chovanec , economic adviser for Silvercrest Asset Management in New York . \u201c But there is concern about whether the U.S. is in a spiral of escalation with China on several fronts . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s visa move targets Chinese graduate students in the United States who have worked , studied , or been employed by entities linked to China \u2019 s efforts to \u201c acquire or divert \u201d technology for the People \u2019 s Liberation Army .\nIt is not immediately clear how many of the 350,000 Chinese students in the United States will be affected .
