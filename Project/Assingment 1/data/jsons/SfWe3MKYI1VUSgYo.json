But what happened in Orlando this weekend was uniquely grim . The figures are familiar by now : 50 dead , 53 wounded , countless more scarred .\nThe details are sketchy , but a picture is emerging . A 29-year-old man named Omar Mateen , inspired by ISIS and animated by homophobia , stormed a gay nightclub with his AR-15 and filled over a 100 bodies with holes . The result was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States , and the worst terrorist attack on American soil since September 11th .\nPredictably , and before the mutilated corpses were cleared , Donald Trump sought to exploit the tragedy . \u201c Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism , \u201d Trump tweeted . \u201c I do n't want congrats , I want toughness & vigilance . We must be smart ! \u201d He then chided President Obama for refusing to say the words 'Radical Islam , \u201d saying he \u201c should step down \u201d for that reason alone . \u201c If Hillary Clinton still can not say the two words Radical Islam , '' he added , `` she should get out of this race for the presidency . \u201d\nThe gaudy , self-congratulatory tone aside , Trump 's statement makes little sense . The implication is that his proposal to ban Muslims would 've prevented this tragedy . Mateen was an American citizen , however . Even if the ban was in place , it would do nothing to prevent lone wolf attacks from American citizens . But the aim of this statement was n't to defend a policy position ; it was an attempt to make the Democrats look weak . Fear is good for business , and while he does n't understand the world , Trump knows how to thrive in this climate . \u201c If we do not get tough and smart real fast , we are not going to have a country anymore , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Because our leaders are weak , I said this was going to happen \u2013 and it is only going to get worse . \u201d\nIt 's a mistake to discount how effective this sort of rhetoric is . It 's daft and bereft of positive content , but that 's beside the point . Plenty of voters are n't discerning . They hear \u201c tough \u201d and \u201c smart \u201d and \u201c real fast \u201d and mistake that for a plan . Every word Trump has uttered about foreign policy illustrates how breathtakingly ignorant he is . But he sounds like a strongman , and that goes a long way in an election defined by fear .\nJosh Marshall , who is reliably smart , pushed back against the Trump-benefits-from-terrorism narrative . \u201c There appears to be a general consensus , \u201d he writes , \u201c that the atrocity in Orlando will be a boon to the campaign of Donald Trump ... Put me down as skeptical about that assumption. \u201d On Marshall 's account , Trump is \u201c psychologically incapable \u201d of effectively politicizing the terror threat because he appears \u201c unsteady , erratic and self-obsessed. \u201d By contrast , Clinton is viewed as temperamentally fit and experienced . Marshall may be right , but it 's not clear what price , if any , Trump will pay for his unsteadiness . After the terrorist attack in San Bernardino last year , pundits noted how immoral , unconstitutional and counterproductive Trump 's Muslim ban would be , but none of it mattered . His numbers skyrocketed . It 's true that a Republican primary electorate is very different from a general electorate , but every time an attack occurs , the fear and the hysteria ratchet up . This attack and the prospect of more could sway the election in unpredictable ways .\nHence Clinton and the Democrats need to think carefully about how they handle this issue , about the language they use . The massacre in Orlando is about homophobia , access to guns , mental illness and radical Islam . Focusing on any one of these at the expense of the other is dishonest and unhelpful . We have to find a way to talk about this problem with the complexity it deserves .\nRepublicans will do everything possible to make this election a referendum on terror . Trump has already endorsed killing the family members of terrorists and expanding our illegal torture program . Moments like this breathe life into his strongman shtick . This presents a challenge for Clinton . She has to talk honestly about the threats without surrendering to the xenophobia of Trump .\nIt 's a rhetorical gripe , but Obama 's unwillingness to use the words \u201c radical Islamic terrorism \u201d has needlessly gifted a talking point to Republicans . Pirouetting around the religious component made diplomatic sense , but it was always dishonest and bad domestic politics . Today , however , Clinton diverged from Obama and made a forceful statement :\n\u201c It matters what we do , not what we say . It matters that we got Bin Laden , not what we called him . But if he [ Trump ] is somehow suggesting I do n't call this for what it is , he has n't been listening . I have clearly said we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering people . We have to stop them . We have to defeat radical Jihadist terrorism , and we will . \u201d\nIt 's important to say this , both because it 's true and because not doing so feeds the Republican delusion that Democrats are n't engaged with geopolitical realities . The irony is that the strength of the GOP 's anti-terror rhetoric is inversely proportional to their effectiveness in dealing with the problem . The last Republican administration did more to destabilize the planet than any in recent memory . ISIS exists only because George W. Bush 's plan for Iraq did n't extend beyond a few weeks . The broken world we 're confronting has Republican fingerprints all over it . Obama ( and Clinton ) have had their share of blunders , but Bush 's failures stand alone . With her statement today , Clinton undercut Trump 's talking point and made a serious conversation about terrorism more likely .\nThis is n't a war against a faith or a people or a culture , but Trump and the purveyors of fear want to make it such . Which is why they ca n't be allowed to dictate the terms of the debate . One can \u2013 and must \u2013 draw a straight line between the attack on that nightclub in Orlando , the reality of gay Muslims being tossed from buildings by Jihadist thugs in Iraq , and the religious doctrines animating this behavior . ISIS is n't Islam and Islam is n't ISIS . And terrorism , it ca n't be said enough , is n't reducible to a single variable \u2013 religion , politics , economics , foreign policy , and Western interventionism all matter a great deal . There 's no nuance-free conversation worth having on this subject .\nAre terrorists weaponizing a largely peaceful faith ? Absolutely . But there is no \u201c true Islam \u201d just as there is no true Christianity or Judaism . And not all religions are equally wise or equally peaceful or equally adaptable . A religion is the sum of its believers at any given moment , and Islam has an internal crisis without an analogue in today 's world .
