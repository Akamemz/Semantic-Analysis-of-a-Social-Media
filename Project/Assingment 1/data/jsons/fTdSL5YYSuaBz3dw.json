    "content": "Another day , another must-read essay from David French -- an attorney and commentator whose contributions to the debate over an allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been invaluable . Yesterday , I laid out my thoughts on the overall controversy , then suggested a manner in which each side 's assertions could be examined and prodded as respectfully and thoroughly as possible , without descending into a circus . Some lefty critics of my approach to this whole issue have asked why I do n't simply believe the accuser , and why her stated recollection is n't satisfactory unto itself as evidence against Judge Kavanaugh .\nIn short , as I 've explained , relying on a lone accuser 's unverifiable claim about something that allegedly took place decades ago strikes me as a profoundly unjust basis on which to tarnish someone 's reputation and derail his career . If that 's the standard that is applied to high-profile political nominees , the recriminations and replications will be endless , corrosive , and bipartisan . Here 's a left-leaning law professor illustrating the perils of this approach to her fellow ideologues :\n2/2 : Let 's stipulate : most women tell the truth . But : say a far-right group pays a woman to falsely accuse a rising Democratic male star of sexually assaulting her 30+ yrs ago , when both were teens . What should the falsely accused man say ? This is a serious , non-snarky question . \u2014 Rosa Brooks ( @ brooks_rosa ) September 17 , 2018\nYes , what should or could a falsely-accused man say ? He could adamantly deny it . Another alleged eyewitness could deny it . Women who knew him well at the time could attest to his high character . His allies could point to discrepancies ( four vs. two men , as deserved in the 2012 therapy notes , which do n't mention Kavanaugh 's name ) and missing pieces of the alleged victim 's story ( specifics of the where , when and how that she ca n't recall ) . That 's precisely what has happened with Kavanaugh thus far . Then what ? If the only answer is to `` believe women , '' that sets up an impossible -- and frankly sexist -- standard under which men literally can not defend themselves against serious accusations , and under which false and defamatory allegations prevail , by default . That is not justice . Contemporaneous corroboration and patterns of conduct are therefore essential components of credible ( which is not the same as proven ) allegations , in the absence of strong physical or digital proof , as is clearly the case here . As for the point about someone 's publicly-relayed account , French reminds us of the notorious and documented fallibility of the human memory :\nOne of the very first things that young litigators learn is that memory is a very , very fickle thing \u2014 even memories of traumatic events . In case after case , you \u2019 ll encounter two opposing litigants who speak with absolutely fierce conviction about key events in their lives , and those memories will often diverge almost completely . When I was young and naive , I often thought that meant one party was telling truth ( my client ! ) , and the other side was full of dirty , vicious liars . It didn \u2019 t take long for me to realize that more often than not both sides believed their own stories , and the longer the case dragged on , the more they hardened in their positions . That \u2019 s one reason why good lawyers , when interviewing clients , ask a few simple , key questions . \u201c Did you take notes of these conversations ? \u201d \u201c Did you tell anyone else this happened ? \u201d \u201c Are there any emails or memos reflecting these agreements ? \u201d You \u2019 re constantly on a quest for the sword that slays the legal beast \u2014 corroborating evidence .\nFrench also mentions a `` number of studies detailing how easy it is to implant memories ( in one study , subjects 'remembered ' details of a surgery that never happened ) , how matters as simple as sleep deprivation can impact memory , and how even short passages of time can distort recollections . '' He goes on to quote a Vox piece about how the unreliability of people 's memories contributed to the terrible University of Virginia gang rape hoax :\nThis becomes an especially pressing question since it \u2019 s clear that the reporter relied on Jackie \u2019 s memory \u2014 and decades of research have demonstrated that memories are are malleable , fragile , flawed . Memories can be twisted by time . Misinformation can skew people \u2019 s memories of events , and completely fabricated memories can even be planted in people such that they weave them into the narrative of their lives . \u201c Just because someone is telling you something in a lot of detail and with a great amount of confidence , \u201d says Elizabeth Loftus , a cognitive psychologist and one of America \u2019 s preeminent researchers on memory , \u201c doesn \u2019 t mean it happened. \u201d If you understand that memory is a foggy patchwork or synthesis of events and exposures in our lives \u2014 and some memories aren \u2019 t real \u2014 you would probably hesitate before relying solely on a person \u2019 s memory . \u201c It \u2019 s very compelling to believe someone \u2019 s memory , \u201d said Loftus , \u201c especially when they cry . But I \u2019 ve seen people cry over false memories , as well as over real ones . \u201d\nThis does n't mean that all , or most , memories are false , of course . It does n't mean that Ford 's memory is wrong in this case . It does n't mean that Kavanaugh and Judge are recalling things either perfectly or inaccurately . It just means that if the core of an allegation is a distant memory , with little to no supporting corroboration from the time in question , major skepticism and caution is warranted ( update : I should reiterate that this was reportedly Dianne Feinstein 's stance on Ford 's accusation , until it was n't ) . That 's particularly true when the stakes are so high .

Because if you take it seriously , as every Democrat will soon profess to doing when they vote no , there \u2019 s no reason they should permit Kavanaugh to sit on the D.C . Circuit . It can \u2019 t be that attempted rape is disqualifying for a Supreme Court justice but merely a \u201c demerit \u201d or whatever for a judge who sits on the Court of Appeals .\nBut is n't there a difference between actively removing someone from office and denying him a promotion to a more powerful post ? AP 's not buying that counterpoint : `` To make the argument that Kavanaugh shouldn \u2019 t be removed from the D.C .

' And that will lead people to question whether the standards of proof should be different , or what standard of proof should be required generally in # MeToo cases where there \u2019 s a single accuser with no hard evidence to support her allegation . '' Quite so . What are the standards of proof and consequence here ? And how can they be applied evenly , as opposed to on an ad hoc basis , with naked politics factoring in heavily ?
