It 's a calculated mix of her opinions on political news , photos from her travels and work to empower women and girls as well as family photos .\nIt was on Twitter that she finally posted a long-anticipated response to her recent email debacle on March 4 : `` I want the public to see my email . I asked State to release them . They said they will review them for release as soon as possible . '' That tweet received more than 10,000 favorites . This week she got more political , weighing in on the House Republicans ' budget , and expressing frustration that the Senate is stuck on a bill that would create a fund for human trafficking victims and is continuing to block Loretta Lynch 's confirmation as attorney general .\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is taking the lead on Facebook . Paul 's politician page has 1.9 million likes and 228,537 people were `` talking '' about him as of Tuesday :\nIn his Facebook posts , he can be seen behind podiums and on political trips . He also links to articles and video clips he 's featured in and infographics that express his views on topics from legalizing marijuana to Loretta Lynch . He also denounces his ( potential future ) competition .\nBut it seems Clinton is n't even in the game on Facebook . She does n't have a verified Facebook page , just a topic page with more than 400,000 likes . That 's still more than Jeb Bush 's 163,000 , even though he appears to be doing all the right things \u2014 using hashtags , tagging friends like Benjamin Netanyahu , and posting selfies , baby pictures and vintage photos of his mom , Barbara Bush , and his wife , Columba :\nWhile verified public pages could not be found for some \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden , former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley or former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum \u2014 many had more than one verified account . For example , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( who has said she will not run ) has two Twitter handles : @ senwarren and @ elizabethforma ; one is her official Twitter account as senator of Massachusetts and the other is her official personal account , in which she describes herself as senator . In one photo , she wears a pink blazer and in the other a blue blazer . The difference in looks is subtle , but she divides the content \u2014 on one account she tweets politics and on the other she cheers on the Patriots .\nAll the numbers so far pale in comparison to accounts that are making big waves on Facebook or Twitter ( see Katy Perry 's 66 million or President Obama 's 56 million followers ) . But the 2016 race is still , technically , anybody 's game \u2014 so the next great social candidate might just be one good tweet or selfie away .",
