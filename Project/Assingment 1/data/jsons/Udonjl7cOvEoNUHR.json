    "content": "I live on a short section of Bleecker Street in Manhattan that is in most ways completely unrepresentative of New York City , much less America . Yet as protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd continue , and violence , looting , and vandalism spread across the country , the 500 feet traversed by my block may spell out the two most-likely futures for a country that seems close to experiencing its most violent season since 1968 , when major riots seemed part of everyday life . Do you see today 's protests as representing the nonviolent , righteous anger of brutalized minorities who have had enough and are now demanding an end to a murderous status quo ? Or do you see them as unleashing anarchy and chaos while masquerading as social justice ? How you respond to them not only says something about you but about where the country might end up .\nAt the west end of my block , Bleecker intersects with Lafayette Street ; there sits Kith , a hip , expensive streetwear shop so popular that it used to meter guests in with a velvet-rope system like a trendy nightclub would . When the coronavirus lockdowns went into effect , clothing stores were deemed nonessential by the powers that be , so Kith locked its doors and emptied the store of all merchandise to prevent would-be thieves from breaking in . You 'd walk by the windows and just see naked shelves where $ 300 sweatsuits and $ 50 knit caps once hung .\nThis past Sunday , though , the owners boarded up the windows with plywood , as if a hurricane were coming ( many businesses throughout the city did the same ) . They should n't have bothered . On Monday morning , I walked by the store around 7 a.m. and saw that the plywood had been peeled back in places and some of the windows smashed . Kith merchandise bags were strewn out on the street .\nThe damage was just part of massive looting throughout the neighborhood . A couple of blocks away on Houston Street near Broadway , a massive Adidas store was wiped clean of virtually all of its stock , with many of its windows broken . Early on Monday morning , I even saw two latecomer looters storm out of the store with armfuls of clothing and into their car , which they 'd left running on the street . Around the corner on Broadway , an NYPD vehicle used by traffic cops was completely scorched and gutted , left in the street like the carcass of an exotic beast . Storefronts had smashed windows and many had , like the Adidas store , been wiped out of all but display stands . `` Dozens of suspected looters were arrested in Soho Sunday night as protests over the death of George Floyd descended into chaos , '' reported The New York Post .\nIn response to the damage , on Monday , Kith 's owners started building a stronger barrier around the perimeter of the store , this time using a scaffolding system and thick green panels that were about 30 feet high . By the end of today , the barrier stood even taller and more imposing , providing what one assumes is an impervious defense to whatever mayhem the night in Gotham might bring .\nNew York 's curfew kicks in at 8 p.m. for the rest of the week , in an attempt to put an end to a couple of days of what The Daily Beast 's Rachel Olding has described as `` complete anarchy . '' Throughout the city on Sunday and Monday nights , Olding documented in her Twitter feed roving bands of mostly young people were breaking into stores and running out with all sorts of merchandise .\nHard to describe how rampant the looting was tonight in Midtown Manhattan and how lawless it was . Complete anarchy . Literally hundreds of stores up and down Broadway , Fifth Ave , Sixth Ave . Kids ruling the streets like it was a party . pic.twitter.com/y9Ly1UD1WX \u2014 Rachel Olding ( @ rachelolding ) June 2 , 2020\nThe response of Kith 's owners is emblematic of one way of dealing with the new reality in New York : hunker down more and more , worried about chaos . The coronavirus lockdown had been stultifying , but it did n't inspire fear the way the past few nights have . The city 's streets had been deserted but they were also peaceful . Now , they are still mostly vacant but the nights are also punctuated by sirens , shouts , and the sounds of breaking glass . Police helicopters patrol the sky , providing a background rumble to the darkness .\nIn an encouraging sign , last night was calm . There was a massive show of force by the NYPD once the curfew hit and next to no looting . `` Some protesters lingered and looting appeared to lessen with an earlier curfew , '' reports The New York Times . If there is relative calm until the curfew expires at the end of the week , even more of the tension will dissipate .\nAnxiety about looting will also fade if there are more events like the one I witnessed yesterday at the other end of my block , where Bleecker meets Bowery . Around 4:30 p.m. , a large , long , loud protest march streamed by , headed uptown , with thousands of people chanting , shouting , and making noise . Police were present , restrained , and sometimes smiling , even as the protesters called out law enforcement for killing George Floyd and other misdeeds .\nLoud , large , nonviolent protest against police brutality on Bowery in # NYC . Do not confuse with looters smashing windows and decking people later tonight .
