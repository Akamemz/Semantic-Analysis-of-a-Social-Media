Then they said the government was only gathering focused bits of data and only on foreign targets .\nThen they admitted intelligence operatives were gathering large amounts of data but not accessing it unless a court first gave the OK .\nNow it appears there are thousands of times each year when the data of Americans not suspected of having anything to do with terrorism are gathered .\n`` Can you understand , though , why some people might not trust what you 're saying right now about wanting ... , `` a reporter asked President Barack Obama last week at a White House news conference .\nAmericans would be comfortable with the programs , he argued , if they knew everything about them .\nJUST WATCHED Obama : Snowden was no patriot Replay More Videos ...

These folks are following the law and doing what they say they 're doing . ' ``\nBut the public has learned about the National Security Agency programs in such a way that every time a new revelation is served up , it undercuts what the president or the major players in the intelligence committee just said . Here are the most glaring examples :\nThe president tried to assuage concerns about the programs during his August 9 news conference . He said he had ordered a new review of the programs , even as he suggested Americans would be better off if NSA leaker Edward Snowden had never let the world know about them .\nThe important thing , he argued , is for Americans to be able to trust their government is n't abusing the information it is collecting .\n`` What you 're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people 's phone calls or inappropriately reading people 's e-mails .

The head of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court took the unprecedented step of issuing a public statement that his barebones staff can only oversee what NSA provides to it .

''\nAccording to Thursday 's Washington Post report , the court is not given all the information about every request for surveillance . And Obama has admitted that the programs needs review to assure Americans they are not violating civil liberties .\nThe most obvious misstatement came from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper when he told Sen. Ron Wyden at a March congressional hearing that the government is n't gathering information on Americans .

Keith Alexander , the head of the NSA , had the following exchange with Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the data mining programs :\nRep. Mike Rogers : `` Does the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails under these two programs ? ''\nGen. Keith Alexander : `` No , we do not have that authority , ''\nRogers : `` Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? ''\nRogers : `` So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? '' he repeated .\nIt has since become clear through subsequent leaks that the government does have temporary access to large amounts of the phone calls and e-mails sent in the United States . But the distinction that allowed Alexander to answer `` no '' is that analysts are supposed to obtain the OK from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before doing so . That 's perhaps why he said they lacked the `` authority . ''\nSubsequent leaks in July about a program called XKeyscore printed in the UK 's Guardian newspaper and in The New York Times suggested that the NSA collects nearly every phone call and e-mail . The idea is that the intelligence community is collecting the entire `` haystack '' of information that it can sift through later when it has some idea what needle it needs to find . Even if the analysts need court approval , the newer disclosures suggest the NSA has access to the content of communications , at least for a time .\nAlexander also argued several times before Congress that information `` gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world . ''\nBut details of these plots have not been shared publicly .\nLawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism . At a July 31 hearing , Sen. Patrick Leahy said by his estimation the NSA 's data showed the data collection had not foiled `` dozens or even several terrorist plots . ''",

He said he had ordered a new review of the programs, even as he suggested Americans would be better off if NSA leaker Edward Snowden had never let the world know about them.\n\nThe important thing, he argued, is for Americans to be able to trust their government isn't abusing the information it is collecting.\n\n\"What you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's e-mails.

And Obama has admitted that the programs needs review to assure Americans they are not violating civil liberties.\n\n3. Clapper: U.S. not gathering Americans' info\n\nThe most obvious misstatement came from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper when he told Sen. Ron Wyden at a March congressional hearing that the government isn't gathering information on Americans. Wyden, who has been a critic of the programs behind closed doors, was trying to get Clapper on the record.\n\nWyden asked Clapper whether the NSA collected \"any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\"\n\nClapper answered, \"No, sir.\"\n\nWyden: \"It does not?\"\n\nClapper: \"Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly.\"\n\nThe nation's top spy later had to apologize in a letter to the Intelligence Committee.

Even if the analysts need court approval, the newer disclosures suggest the NSA has access to the content of communications, at least for a time.\n\n5. Alexander: 50 plots thwarted\n\nAlexander also argued several times before Congress that information \"gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world.\"\n\nBut details of these plots have not been shared publicly.\n\nLawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism.
