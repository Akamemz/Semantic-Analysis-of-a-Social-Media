    "content": "Last year , the Democrats portrayed President Trump as a monster for authorizing an immigration policy under which border authorities separated some children from the \u201c families \u201d with which they had illegally entered the country . Ignoring the inconvenient fact that many of the people from whose arms these kids were \u201c so cruelly torn \u201d weren \u2019 t parents or relatives , they compared the president to Adolf Hitler and accused him of state terrorism . The Trump administration now plans to close the legal loophole that required the separations and is all too predictably being denounced by the Democrats for that proposal . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s statement was typical :\nThe Administration is seeking to codify child abuse , plain and simple\u2026 . This inhumane and utterly unconscionable rule circumvents the conditions set in the Flores settlement , and we expect the District Court to swiftly strike it down . Democrats continue to call on this Administration to end its assault on families and children , and to join us to protect families and preserve America \u2019 s heritage as a beacon of hope , freedom and opportunity for all .\nAs it happens , the \u201c inhumane \u201d change proposed by the Trump administration would keep families together by preventing the separation of children from families awaiting immigration hearings . The Flores settlement that Pelosi and the Democrats want so desperately to keep in place incentivizes illegal aliens to game our immigration system by bringing children to the border . Far from protecting children , it exposes them to all manner of exploitation and criminal maltreatment , including kidnapping and sexual abuse . It is also the engine that drives the notoriously ineffective \u201c catch and release \u201d policy that has rendered it all but impossible to enforce our immigration laws .\nLike so many of the statutes and federal regulations that prevent the efficient operation of federal departments , the Flores settlement is part of the Clinton legacy , and its many flaws were exacerbated by a meddling federal judge during the Obama era . In 1997 , the government settled a long-standing piece of litigation that said children who had entered the country illegally would be detained in the least restrictive setting possible for the shortest period of time in order to be placed with a family member or some other qualified care provider . Then , in 2015 , an Obama-appointed federal district court judge interpreted \u201c shortest period of time \u201d to mean \u201c no longer than three weeks . \u201d\nBecause the adults with whom these children arrived were frequently detained due to eligibility issues and were unlikely to get an immigration hearing within three weeks , the DHS was faced with the choice of separating the children from their \u201c parents \u201d and releasing the entire \u201c family unit \u201d into the general U.S. population . The Obama administration chose the latter course and went with \u201c catch and release. \u201d It goes without saying that very few of the erstwhile detainees ever materialized for their hearings . The Trump administration \u2019 s alternative policy was subsequently demagogued by the Democrats , so DHS has proposed the new rule , the highlights of which are summarized below :\nFirst and foremost , the new rule permanently establishes standards of care in custody for children and families . These standards are high . In doing so , the rule fulfills one of the central , original purposes of the 1997 Flores court settlement to ensure appropriate care for all children.\u2026 Second , the new rule closes the legal loophole that arose from the reinterpretation of Flores \u2014 which Congress has refused to do \u2014 allowing the federal government to house alien families together in appropriate facilities during fair and expeditious proceedings , as was done by the previous administration in 2014 and 2015.\u2026 Third \u2014 by closing the key loophole in Flores \u2014 the new rule will restore integrity to our immigration system and eliminate the major pull factor fueling the current crisis.\u2026 And fourth , the new rule will protect children by reducing incentives for adults , including human smugglers , to take advantage of minors in the dangerous journey to our border , using them to exploit the system and be released into the United States .\nIt \u2019 s strange that the Democrats object to the establishment of uniform standards of care for children , allowing families to stay together while being processed through the immigration system , restoring some sanity to that process , and protecting children from exploitation by human smugglers .
