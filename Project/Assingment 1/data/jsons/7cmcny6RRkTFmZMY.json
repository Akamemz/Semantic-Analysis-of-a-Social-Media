    "content": "As societies get richer , they consume more resources . That also means they generate more pollution , driving climate change and destroying natural ecosystems .\nWe need to somehow break this link between material wealth and environmental catastrophe . That \u2019 s why financial institutions and governments have been focused on the idea of \u2018 decoupling \u2019 GDP growth from resource use .\nThe idea of \u2018 decoupling \u2019 is driven by the recognition that to stay within the \u2018 safe limit \u2019 of 1.5 degrees Celsius , we have to dramatically reduce our material consumption of Earth 's resources .\nThe assumption is that it is possible to continue growing the global economy while reducing our actual resource use and material footprint , perhaps by shifting to renewable energy .\nThis notion has been most recently articulated in the book More From Less : The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources\u2014and What Happens Next , by Andrew McAfee , principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management . Financial and other data , McAfee argued , shows we can actually easily reduce our material footprint while continuing to grow our economies in a win-win scenario .\nBut new scientific analysis by a group of systems scientists and economists who have advised the United Nations seems to pull the rug out from under this entire enterprise . The new research indicates that the conventional approach is based on selective readings of statistical data .\nMcAfee argues , for instance , that as we are increasing wealth , the productivity motor of capitalism is driving us to greater heights of efficiency due to better technologies . This means we are able to make stuff faster and smaller using less materials and in some cases less energy . And that in turn implies we are causing less pollution . The problem is that this story , according to the new research , ignores how greater efficiency in certain regions or sectors is not slowing down the overall consumption machine . Within the wider system these efficiencies are enabling us to consume even greater quantities of resources overall .\nThat \u2019 s why decades of data on material flows confirm that there are \u201c no realistic scenarios \u201d for such decoupling of economic growth from resource use . Combing through 179 of the best studies of this issue from 1990 to 2019 further reveals \u201c no evidence \u201d that any meaningful decoupling has ever taken place .\n\u201c The goal of decoupling rests partly on faith , \u201d conclude the team from the BIOS Research Institute in Finland , an independent multidisciplinary scientific organisation studying the effects of environmental and resource factors on economy , politics , and culture .\nThe BIOS team previously advised the UN Global Sustainable Development Report on the risk that endless economic growth under capitalism would be undermined due to intensifying \u201c biophysical \u201d limits . A combination of diminishing returns from energy extraction and increasing costs of environmental crises are already undermining growth , and require us to rewrite the global economic operating system , the scientists concluded in a powerful background report to the UN .\nIn two new , peer-reviewed research papers published in June , their analysis goes further . Capitalism \u2019 s drive for maximising profits means that the economy is structured around continued economic growth : if it doesn \u2019 t grow , it collapses . This means that huge technological efficiencies tend to empower capitalism to grow faster and bigger .\nThe first study , published in Environmental Politics , points out that the environmental impacts and resource use of many national economies is unsustainable . If the economy is to continue growing or even remain at the present level , in order to stay within the planetary boundaries of resource use we have to \u2018 decouple \u2019 it from these environmental impacts .\nYet the authors conclude that many of the accounting measures used to conclude that decoupling is happening systematically obscure or exclude critical data .\n\u201c The existence of decoupling in a bounded geographical area or economic sector does not , as such , mean that decoupling is happening in a wider context , \u201d argued the BIOS team :\n\u201c Well-known and widely studied phenomena such as Jevons \u2019 paradox , rebound , and outsourcing show that sectoral and local decoupling can co-exist with and even depend on increased environmental impact and increased resource use outside the analysed geographical or sectoral unit , \u201d they wrote .\nIn 1865 , English economist William Stanley Jevons noted that technological improvements which increased efficiencies in coal-use did not lead to a decline in coal consumption , but instead drove even greater consumption of coal in an even wider range of industries .\nSo while decoupling can seem to occur in certain geographies or sectors , it \u201c can co-exist with ( and even depend on ) increased negative impacts or resource use outside the analysed sector or area \u201d , according to the BIOS authors . All too often , greater efficiencies can translate into heightened environmental impacts because they enable greater levels of consumption at lower cost .\nMuch of the data marshalled by McAfee and others , in the analysis of the BIOS team , would represent cherry-picking from a narrow window that focuses on a particular region or sector without acknowledging the wider impacts outside that region or sector . As a result , much deeper environmental impacts of resource use can often be excluded from the analysis simply by narrowing down that data-focus .\nI spoke to McAfee about the new research by the BIOS authors . He was skeptical of the findings : \u201c We seem to agree that specific cases of decoupling are indeed taking place\u2014decoupling from carbon emissions for instance . Where we disagree is that I see these instances of decoupling as part of a wider trend that is only going to improve overall , although globally less developed nations still have to catch up . \u201d\nI asked McAfee about the conclusion that such decoupling is only \u2018 relative \u2019 and could be enabling increasing resource consumption . \u201c In the United States , we have clear data on absolute decoupling , \u201d he said . \u201c I can highlight two key examples : Our fertiliser use and metals consumption have all undergone clear declines in recent years . This and other data provides unmistakable evidence that absolute decoupling in the US is happening . Fertiliser consumption has undergone a real reduction . So I find it quite puzzling that they conclude there \u2019 s no evidence of this . \u201d\nThe data McAfee sent me did indeed seem to indicate declines in potash sulfate , phosphate , and nitrogen use from around the 2000s onwards . But his own data also complicated this picture , noting that \u201c total fertilizer \u201d use in US agriculture has not declined overall\u2014it first peaked around 2008 , then declined for a few years before returning to and breaching 2008 levels in 2014 .\nFigures from elsewhere offered a totally different picture . World Bank data shows that total fertilizer consumption per hectare in the US has experienced an overall rise from 112.52 kilograms ( kg ) per hectare in 2002 to 138.6 kilograms per hectare 2016 . And a US Department of Agriculture study from that year finds no evidence at all of an absolute decline in energy or fertiliser consumption in US agriculture since 2002 .\nEconomic anthropologist Dr Jason Hickel from the University of Goldsmiths argues that McAfee has committed an \u2018 accounting error \u2019 which excludes \u201c the resources involved in extracting , producing , and transporting \u201d imported goods . As a huge amount of production is offshored , \u201c that side of resource use has been conveniently shifted off their books . \u201d\nI ran McAfee \u2019 s stats by BIOS \u2019 Tere Vad\u00e9n , lead author of the two new studies . He told me that finding isolated cases of absolute decoupling on specific things like \u201c horse manure , CFC-gases , paper , etc. \u201d tells us \u201c very little of the overall metabolism. \u201d Usually this sort of \u2018 decoupling \u2019 is only evidence of particular \u201c changes in methods of production and patterns of consumption. \u201d So if the US uses less paper but exports more wood including chips for burning in the UK , this tells us little about the overall economic resource use of the country . \u201c That is why a geographically comprehensive and economy-wide perspective is needed for any evidence that has bearing on global absolute resource recoupling , which is the only ecologically sufficient goal . \u201d\nThus , according to the BIOS authors , apparent improvements at a certain scale often turn out to be artifacts of how we are choosing to measure . Just because we are dramatically improving efficiencies in technology production does not mean we are actually reducing our real-world material footprint .\nVad\u00e9n described McAfee \u2019 s book as \u201c thin , and years behind the curve \u201d in terms of research and evidence : \u201c By cherry-picking small pieces of evidence of decoupling , and attaching that to a theoretically sound argument for the possibility of decoupling , it is possible to present a picture that many people find attractive . But the picture is as far from really existing capitalism , as a Soviet presentation of socialism was from really existing socialism . Yes , it is in principle possible , yes , there are some facts to support it , but overall the picture is false and misleading . \u201d\nThe big , long picture seems unequivocal . Global use of material resources , the team show , has increased tenfold from 1900 to the present day\u2014from less than 10 Gigatonnes ( Gt ) per year to roughly 88.6 Gt in 2017 . In the decades since 1970 , the global rate of growth has accelerated , not slowed , as consumption has more than tripled .\nMeanwhile , only 9-12 percent of materials are recycled , and about half of all resource use is used to provide energy in a broad sense . The other half is used for infrastructure such as buildings , transport , machines and consumer goods .\nThe BIOS authors find that there are certainly clear cases of resource use seeming to diminish while GDP grows . But these are limited to specific economic sectors or particular geographical regions , and always linked to deepening of resource use elsewhere . The problem is that there is \u201c no evidence of ongoing , global absolute resource decoupling . \u201d\nThe situation is pretty serious . The scientists attempted to identify what genuine decoupling needs to look like , and then to discover whether there is any concrete data that it is happening . Unfortunately , there isn \u2019 t :\n\u201c For absolute resource decoupling to make sense as a global goal , we would need a scenario where , in [ about ] 30 years , the economy produces 2.6 times more GDP out of every ton of material used , under conditions where material use diminishes [ about ] 40 percent globally . Currently , no trends corresponding to this scenario are observable and , to our knowledge , no concrete proposals with such a level of decoupling have been presented , \u201d they wrote .\nThe second paper by the BIOS team published in Environmental Science & Policy is even more damning . The team went further to review the entire corpus of scientific literature over the last few decades to see if any empirical evidence of genuine , absolute decoupling can be found .\nThe study reviewed 179 scientific studies on decoupling published between 1990 and 2019 and found , in short , that : \u201c \u2026 the evidence does not suggest that decoupling towards ecological sustainability is happening at a global ( or even regional ) scale . \u201d\nWhile there is some evidence of \u2018 impact decoupling , \u2019 especially for greenhouse gas emissions in wealthy countries for certain periods of time , there is no evidence of \u201c economy-wide resource decoupling , least of all on the international and global scale . Quite the opposite : there is evidence of increased material intensity and re-coupling . \u201d\nDecoupling is therefore not a truly scientific concept , they argue . It is , instead , merely an \u201c abstract possibility that no empirical evidence can disprove but that in the absence of robust empirical evidence or detailed and concrete plans rests , in part , on faith . \u201d\nBut this does not mean we need to give up on the very idea of prosperity . Rather it means recognising that there are other ways of creating prosperity which do not require endless growth .\nAs Hickel has shown : \u201c Over and over again , empirical data shows that it is possible to achieve high levels of human welfare without high levels of GDP with significantly less pressure on the planet . How ? By sharing income more fairly and investing in universal health care , education , and other public goods . The evidence is clear : When it comes to delivering long , healthy , flourishing lives for all , this is what counts\u2014this is what progress looks like . \u201d\nIf these new studies are accurate , then continuing business-as-usual and saving the planet are mutually exclusive . The idea that we can do both is a persistent mythology , an article of \u201c faith \u201d no less , that needs to be discarded .\nIn its place , we need to find ways to fundamentally restructure our economies and production relations to transition to new forms of prosperity that leave endless growth in the dust .",
