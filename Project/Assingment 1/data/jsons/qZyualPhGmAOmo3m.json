Many of his supporters yearn for a return to an unspecified era of prosperity and patriotism , before what they see as today \u2019 s suffocating political correctness .\nBut in bringing up the marital infidelities of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s husband , as Mr. Trump and his surrogates are doing in the wake of his much-panned performance in Monday \u2019 s debate , the GOP nominee may be indulging in a sort of nostalgia that is unlikely to benefit his White House bid . In part that may be because the values of a number American voters are very different than the distant era of 1998 .\nWhile such an appeal might resonate among his white , male base , women and Millennial generation voters are particularly unlikely to be moved by Trump \u2019 s attempts to link Mrs. Clinton with President Bill Clinton \u2019 s affairs and impeachment , says Jennifer Lawless , director of the Women and Politics Institute and a professor of government at American University .\nFor many women , when Trump talks about the subject of sex , they \u2019 ll hear the word \u201c gender. \u201d They \u2019 ll interpret Trump \u2019 s words as implicit criticism of Clinton \u2019 s decisions about her marriage at the time , and as an effort to disparage a wife for the transgressions of the husband .\nFor Millennials , they \u2019 ll hear about Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers and Ken Starr and tune out . The youngest eligible voters today weren \u2019 t even born when news broke that President Clinton was having an affair with a young intern . Litigating old conflicts probably isn \u2019 t a great way to sway Millennial votes .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think this is going to work like Trump thinks it will , \u201d says Professor Lawless . \u201c It makes me feel like the last 20 years didn \u2019 t happen . \u201d\nOn one hand , it \u2019 s a clear way of highlighting the old scandals ( or perceived scandals ) of the Clinton years . It suggests to voters they can expect the same again if they elect a second Clinton to office . And it might work for those who lived through that period and disliked it .\nBut many of today \u2019 s voters \u2013 women in particular \u2013 may also think it suggests something more offensive , says Lawless : that Hillary Clinton was not sufficient as a wife , and this made Mr. Clinton stray .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a suggestion to voters that maybe they need to look elsewhere like Bill did , \u201d says Lawless .\nFor his part , Trump is treating references to Mr. Clinton \u2019 s infidelities as explosive material .\nIn an oblique reference at the end of Monday \u2019 s debate Trump said that he had been going to say something \u201c extremely rough \u201d to Clinton but had refrained because it was \u201c inappropriate. \u201d Since then has dropped a few direct references . On Thursday at a campaign rally in New Hampshire , at one point Trump said , \u201c An impeachment for lying , \u201d referring to the attempt to remove Mr. Clinton from office for lying about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky . \u201c Remember that ? Impeach . \u201d\nThe Trump campaign has told surrogates to raise the issue more directly . If asked about the ongoing dispute over Alicia Machado , the former Miss Universe whom Trump continues to disparage for having gained weight during her reign as pageant winner , surrogates should pivot to the Lewinsky scandal , according to the Trump campaign .\nThey should say Mrs. Clinton \u201c bullied and smeared \u201d women who have accused Mr. Clinton of sexual harassment , according to Trump campaign talking points obtained by NBC News .\nIn the past , Clinton has indeed lashed out at women who have charged her husband with misconduct . In the early 1990s , she dismissed Ms. Flowers \u2019 statement of an affair with Mr. Clinton .
