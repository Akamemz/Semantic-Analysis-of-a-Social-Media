    "content": "Any time I suggest there are things women can do to avoid sexual harassment I come under immediate fire . \u201c You \u2019 re blaming the victim ! \u201d \u201c Why should women change when men are the perpetrators ? \u201d \u201c Why are you shifting the responsibility to women ? \u201d\nFor the record , sexual assault is not permissible under any circumstances . It doesn \u2019 t matter if it \u2019 s men groping other men , men taking advantage of women , or whether the offender is powerful , a peer , or complete stranger . If it isn \u2019 t consensual , it \u2019 s off limits .\nOn the other hand , consider this : You don \u2019 t leave your front door wide open and say , \u201c Why do I have to change when it \u2019 s the thief \u2019 s behavior that \u2019 s the problem ! \u201d You don \u2019 t walk down a dark alley on the bad side of town alone , leave your keys in the ignition , or taunt street gang members . And you don \u2019 t go to a hotel room late at night for a business meeting .\nI \u2019 m not saying that if you do you deserve to be harassed or assaulted . No , far from it . But neither do I accept the outlook that women are dependent on the law and others to protect them . There are precautions women can and should take . And the more we deny women the opportunity to take control before an incident can occur , the less empowered they feel .\nI am a woman . I rose up through the ranks in Silicon Valley during the 1980s and 90s to become one of only 3 women CEOs in technology at that time . Surrounded by male executives , engineers , scientists , and investors , there should be no doubt in anyone \u2019 s mind as to whether I experienced my share of offensive advances , offers , and suggestions .\nBut here is where I part company with my sisters who are calling for the heads of Weinstein , Franken , Lauer , Rose , Conyers , Keillor , Moore , and others . I took as many measures as I could to avoid situations where I could be vulnerable . Obviously , I wasn \u2019 t successful at eliminating all harassment . But as sure as I run my own business today , I \u2019 m confident I avoided many more incidents than I fell victim to .\nAnd while I \u2019 m certain to hear from folks who insist I \u2019 m making women responsible for the sexual misconduct which is now coming to light , for those interested in taking measures to head off harassment , these are some of the workarounds I found helpful :\n1 . Avoid dinner meetings when possible . And if you can \u2019 t avoid dinner , ask if you can pick the restaurant . Then suggest one you know has valet parking .\nWhen dinner is over , excuse yourself to the restroom , flag down a busboy , waiter , etc. , Hand them your valet ticket and a nice tip and tell them you need the valet to have your car running outside the front entrance . In this way , a man can not offer to \u201c walk you to your car . \u201d\nAnd here \u2019 s another thing . Never agree to drive a man to his car . Always have a large empty box you can plunk into the front passenger seat . Just point to the box and say \u201c I would , but . . . \u201c\n2 . Avoid traveling together on a plane . This way you will not have to sit closely together for long stretches of time and can also avoid sharing ground transportation .\n3 . Check into different hotels . Claim you reserved your room too late or are collecting rewards points from another chain . While you \u2019 re at it , make sure to ask for a room that is not on the ground floor .\n4 . Never meet in a man \u2019 s hotel room ( even a suite ) , or go to their home to conduct business . Suggest a public place .\n5 . When you meet in an office or conference room leave the door open . And if and when it makes sense , invite other members of your team to the meeting .\n6 . Working late is often necessary , but these days there is very little that can not be done at home . If you do need to stay late find a friend who also has some catching up to do . The buddy system works .\n7 . Avoid discussing personal issues . This can easily be mistake for receptivity . If you are asked about your marriage , children , sexual likes or dislikes , etc. , use a segue like , \u201c Oh , that \u2019 s not very interesting . . . but you know what IS really interesting ? '' and then insert a business , sports , or other neutral topic .\n8 . Company celebrations , holiday parties and other social gatherings ( especially those involving alcohol ) are land mines . Participate and be sociable , but leave early before the fun gets out of hand .\n9 . If a man is getting suggestive , excuse yourself to go to the restroom . Often a long break in the momentum will bring a perpetrator to his senses . If this doesn \u2019 t work then make an excuse to leave the room immediately .\n10 . Do not accept gifts . When I received flowers , I was quick to say thank you and tell the sender they were so beautiful I wanted everyone to enjoy them and placed them in the front lobby . If a man brings you coffee , lunch , etc. , thank him and make sure to pay for it . This sends a clear message .\nThere are of course dozens and dozens of ways to quash the opportunity for sexual harassment , but you get the picture . I found the best way to deal with unwanted advances is to do everything in my power to avoid confrontation , danger , embarrassment , and worse . The fact is , by thinking and acting ahead of time , I felt empowered . And empowerment is the opposite of victimization .\nYet , even taking as many precautions as I did , I could not sidestep all of the unsolicited attention my gender garnered .\nIf I had known then , what I know now , I would have done what Gretchen Carlson suggests in her book `` Be Fierce . '' I would have told others what happened . I would have put the details down in writing . I would have skipped going to Human Resources who put the interest of the company first and foremost . I would have hired an experienced lawyer to help me navigate a touchy situation . By taking these steps , Carlson was not only able to protect her career from injury , she stopped Fox News ' Roger Ailes .\nAnd though Carlson is to be praised and admired for her courage , I see the problem of sexual harassment differently .
