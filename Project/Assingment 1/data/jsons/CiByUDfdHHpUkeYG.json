She told the Associated Press she was heading to the Washington meetings `` cautiously , but also with hope . ''\nHanan Ashrawi , a Palestinian spokeswoman , told AP the upcoming talks are being held under more difficult conditions than previous negotiations .

''\nThe restart of the long-stalled talks is being attributed to Secretary of State John Kerry 's six months of frenetic shuttle diplomacy .\nAgency spokeswoman Jen Psaki said both sides had accepted invitations from Kerry to come to Washington `` to formally resume direct final status negotiations '' that are scheduled to begin Monday evening and continue Tuesday .\nPsaki said in a statement that Kerry on Sunday called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and that the leaders agreed the talks would `` serve as an opportunity to develop a procedural work plan for how the parties can proceed with the negotiations in the coming months .
