Modern conservative mythology begins with Reagan , a man who tripled the federal budget deficit ( which shot up to $ 3 trillion during his tenure ) and raised taxes 11 times during the course of his presidency . Reagan did n't shrink the size of government or grow the middle class . On the contrary , he made government more bloated , more defense-oriented , more corporatist . George W.
