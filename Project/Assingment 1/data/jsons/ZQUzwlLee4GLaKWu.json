Hong/AP\n\nNPR was invited to observe two focus groups of swing voters from Ohio and Arizona on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. \"Wal-Mart Moms\" are identified by pollsters as women predominantly between the ages of 18 and 44, who have kids under 18 living at home and who shop at Wal-Mart stores at least once a month.

Social media is a powerful \u2014 and divisive \u2014 force\n\nFrustration and exhaustion from social media, particularly Facebook, was a common theme.

Some expressed a concern that a third-party vote was a \"wasted vote,\" but on the whole, there was a welcome attitude about third-party candidates this cycle. There was also no voiced opposition to having Johnson participate in the presidential debates.\n\n3. The conventions didn't matter; the debates will\n\nVery little information about either the Republican convention in Cleveland or the Democratic convention in Philadelphia broke through to the moms. Most said they watched some speeches and saw \"snippets\" on social media, but there were almost no lasting impressions voiced from either group. However, nearly all of the moms said the upcoming presidential debates will play a major role in helping them finalize their vote.\n\n\"She has more facts and experience and knowledge about the inner workings of government, and that is where it's going to show exactly how little he knows,\" said Julie, a white, married mother of two from Columbus. There was a consensus that Clinton will \"win\" the debates but that Trump \"will be talked about the most.\"\n\n4. The first female presidential candidate is NBD\n\nClinton made history this year to become the first woman nominated by a major party to run for president. But the moms overwhelmingly said that wouldn't affect how they vote. Nearly all agreed that the historic candidacy of Barack Obama, the first black man nominated, felt much bigger and more urgent.\n\n\"It was more exciting, it was more history-making. He had so much he envisioned. He had real issues he was fighting for,\" said Dana from Columbus.\n\nIvania, a Hispanic mother of two from Columbus, said she is disappointed voters don't seem to care much about Clinton's milestone. \"It was almost kind of skipped over, and it was sad,\" she said.\n\n5.

Rob Portman of Ohio and John McCain of Arizona both got higher marks than Trump, and many moms said they'd be willing to split their tickets to support them.\n\n6. Clinton is fundamentally untrustworthy\n\nWithout a doubt the biggest criticism of Clinton is that these women \u2014 even those inclined to support her \u2014 think she can't be trusted. It was a theme revisited over and over again throughout the evening.\n\n\"You don't know what's the truth and what's the lie,\" says Donna, a married mother of one child from Columbus.

None of them believed she told the truth, or handled the fallout well.\n\n7. That said, no one thinks Trump can win\n\nOf the 20 women, five were leaning Trump, seven were leaning Clinton, and eight were undecided or leaning third party. But asked who they thought would win, regardless of their leaning, the answer was unanimous: Clinton. But none of the women were that excited about it. Most of them described it as a \"lesser of two evils\" vote or an \"anti-Trump\" vote more than a \"pro-Hillary\" vote.\n\n8. It doesn't matter anyway\n\nMaybe the most depressing takeaway is how poorly the women view the country's ability to govern itself. Many believe it doesn't really matter who wins because the gridlock in Washington is unlikely to change.\n\nThere was almost a resignation to the fact that government just doesn't work well anymore, and that politicians are all deeply disconnected from the challenges of their everyday lives.
