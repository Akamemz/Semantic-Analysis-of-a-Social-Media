    "content": "At the tail end of 2008 , Mike Pence , then a Republican congressman from Indiana , appeared on Fox News to state his strong personal opposition to a bailout to the Detroit auto industry . `` As the American people know , '' he said , `` we ca n't borrow and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy or a healthy domestic automotive industry . '' At the same time , he also declared his opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that came in the wake of the financial crisis , writing a letter to congressional colleagues insisting that government should not intervene to protect businesses from failure . `` We now have a deal that promises to bring near-term stability to our financial turmoil , but at what price ? '' he wrote . `` Economic freedom means the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail . '' On Fox , Pence stressed not only his own opposition , but the large number of Republican legislators who stood unified in opposition to the deal . He was acting as a representative of the party 's stance .\nIn the years since , Pence appears to have changed his mind .\nAt a press conference yesterday Pence , now the governor of Indiana and the Vice President elect , announced that he and President elect Trump had brokered a deal with air-conditioning maker Carrier to keep about 800 jobs in the United States that had previously been set to go to Mexico . In exchange for keeping some jobs in the U.S. , Carrier would receive $ 7 million in incentives from the state of Indiana .\nAt the conference , Pence defended the arrangement by declaring that `` the free market has been sorting it out and America 's been losing .
