The hearing is the first chance for America , and the rest of the world , to see and hear for themselves about Trump 's actions toward Ukraine and consider whether they are , in fact , impeachable offenses .\nThe proceedings were being broadcast live , and on social media , from a packed hearing room on Capitol Hill . The country has been here only three times before , and never against the 21st century backdrop of real-time commentary , including from the Republican president himself .\nTestifying will be two seasoned diplomats , William Taylor , the graying former infantry officer now charge d'affaires in Ukraine , and George Kent , the deputy assistant secretary in Washington , telling the striking , if sometimes complicated story of a president allegedly using foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election .\nSo far , the narrative is splitting Americans , mostly along the same lines as Trump 's unusual presidency . The Constitution sets a dramatic but vague bar for impeachment , and there 's no consensus yet that Trump 's actions at the heart of the inquiry meet the threshold of `` high crimes and misdemeanors . ''\nTrump calls the whole thing a `` witch hunt , '' a retort that echoes Nixon 's own defense . \u201c READ THE TRANSCRIPT , \u201d he tweeted Wednesday .\nAt its core , the inquiry stems from Trump \u2019 s July 25 phone call with Ukraine 's newly elected president , Volodymyr Zelenskiy when he asked the Zelenskiy for \u201c a favor . \u201d\nTrump wanted the Ukraine government to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival , Joe Biden , all while holding as leverage military aid the young democracy relies on as it confronts an aggressive Russia .\nAn anonymous whistleblower first alerted officials to concerns about the phone call .
