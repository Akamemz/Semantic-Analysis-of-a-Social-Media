    "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders announces that he is suspending his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in a livestream broadcast from his home in Burlington , Vt. , April 8 , 2020 . ( Bernie Sanders 2020 Campaign/Reuters )\nAs he bows out of what will presumably be his final White House run , the Democratic Party appears to be passing the Vermont senator by .\n\u2018 Few would deny that over the course of the past five years , our movement has won the ideological struggle. \u201d That \u2019 s how Bernie Sanders ended his presidential campaign , and that \u2019 s the line his supporters are taking in reaction to the news . Sure , Sanders has lost the nomination to a candidate with obvious and much-discussed debilities for the second time in four years , the argument goes , but his achievement will endure : He made democratic socialism ( or at least social democracy ) palatable in the United States . He shifted the Overton Window to the left , earned the loyal support of tens of millions of young Americans who will remain politically engaged , and helped Jacobin gain thousands of subscriptions . \u201c Years and decades from now , we will look back on Bernie Sanders \u2019 s two presidential campaigns as massively transformational in American politics , \u201d says Micah Uetricht , that magazine \u2019 s managing editor .\nWill we , though ? That may have been a reasonable thing to say after 2016 , when Sanders notched a series of stunning wins in midwestern states while making real inroads among young voters of all races , but it doesn \u2019 t fit the evidence we have now , four years later . The rationale for Sanders \u2019 s 2020 campaign \u2014 that he could secure massive turnout among young people and the pan-ethnic working class by pitching a quasi-revolutionary message , while also mounting a challenge to Donald Trump \u2019 s claim to low-education white voters \u2014 has proven to be delusional . And while he may have gotten his rivals to embrace versions of some of his signature proposals , the Democratic Party is undergoing a long-term shift that does not bode well for his brand of politics .\nBoth times Sanders ran for president , he lost black voters in Southern states by huge margins . Sanders did improve among Latinos from 2016 to 2020 , allowing him to win California and put up a stronger fight in Texas this time around . But he couldn \u2019 t repeat his performance among the non-college-educated whites who \u2019 d clearly favored him over Hillary Clinton , especially in the Midwest . Reporters have noted that the Sanders campaign \u2019 s theory of the electorate was misguided : He avoided retail politics in the hope that his message would eventually carry the day \u2014 that the masses would be spontaneously drawn into the movement , in Lenin \u2019 s formulation . As Joe Simonson observes in the Washington Examiner , the Vermont senator \u2019 s predictions of massive turnout were proven wrong repeatedly , suggesting he \u2019 d built his battle plan on materialist theory rather than political reality .\nIn fact , the triumph of theory over reality may have doomed Sanders \u2019 s second run for the White House . The American working class has plenty of social moderates and conservatives , but his campaign elevated such figures as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Linda Sarsour , beloved by the Democratic Party \u2019 s activist class and controversial outside of it . He walked back his 2016-era border hawkishness and replaced it with activist-endorsed \u201c abolish ICE \u201d messaging . His campaign declined to forthrightly make its case to black voters out of academic concern that Sanders \u201c couldn \u2019 t speak on behalf of people of color \u201d because he \u201c doesn \u2019 t have those experiences . \u201d\nBut then , Sanders has never successfully navigated American political institutions to generate the kind of overwhelming enthusiasm he \u2019 d need to either pass genuinely transformative policies in the Senate or expand his voter base in elections . That suggests a tension between the imperatives of democratic politics and the uncompromising nature of his own brand , which fed the perception that he was \u201c unelectable. \u201d Among his backers , this perception was often blamed on \u201c subservience to the economic-powers-that-be \u201d among moderates and political pundits . It \u2019 s a convenient explanation : The candidate wasn \u2019 t at fault , his voters were just being duped by the corporate media and political establishment . But as political scientists Matthew Grossman and William Isaac have written , the failure of redistributive economic policies may owe more to the procedural elements of American political institutions , which require deliberation and compromise , than to any rigging of the system against working-class interests .\nIn any case , Sanders \u2019 s failure has a structural explanation , too . It was identified by University of Texas professor Michael Lind all the way back in 2016 . \u201c At the beginning of his campaign , Mr. Sanders the democratic socialist focused in the manner of a single issue candidate almost exclusively on themes of class . . . . But because he is running for the Democratic presidential nomination , he has had to put greater emphasis on other issues , including racial disparity in policing and sentencing and the environment and immigration , \u201d Lind wrote at the time . For Lind , this was telling : The Democratic coalition increasingly resembled \u201c an alliance of Northern , Midwestern and West Coast whites from the old Rockefeller Republican tradition with blacks and Latinos , \u201d the product of a deal in which affluent whites would embrace high-status positions on identity issues in exchange for black and Latino support for neoliberal economic policies . On the other side , Lind wrote , Republicans could make inroads among non-college-educated whites by tacking away from unpopular libertarian positions on trade and entitlement reform .\nThis theory of the partisan realignment has become conventional wisdom , and is sometimes overstated . But Lind \u2019 s view of the dynamics in the Democratic Party fits observed reality far better than that of Sanders \u2019 s die-hards . And not just in 2020 : All the loose talk in 2018 about a new wave of progressive , multiethnic Democrats who would challenge the party \u2019 s establishment and demonstrate the cross-country appeal of Sanders-style politics fizzled out after the midterm elections . ( A reliable weathervane of the party \u2019 s activist class , Data for Progress founder Sean McElwee , hand-picked his own weathervanes for a progressive insurgency in the 2018 midterms . They all lost . Since then , McElwee has grown louder about cultural issues and quieter about economic ones . ) Instead , Democrats won back the House by taking a lot of affluent suburban districts from Republicans on the strength of candidates such as Abigail Spanberger and Elissa Slotkin , who attacked Trump \u2019 s personal grotesqueness and his record on health care but otherwise ran as moderates .\nLind predicted four years ago that a \u201c slightly more progressive version of neoliberalism freed of the strategic concessions to white working-class voters associated with Bill Clintonism \u201d was the future of the Democratic Party . That sounds like a pretty apt description of Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign , which in turn suggests that moderate candidates \u2014 Spanberger , Slotkin , a future iteration of Cory Booker \u2014 are where the party is headed next . Will ambitious Democrats and aspiring socialists learn from Sanders \u2019 s failure ? On one hand , there are already signs that would-be inheritors of the Sanders legacy are abandoning his uncompromising politics .
