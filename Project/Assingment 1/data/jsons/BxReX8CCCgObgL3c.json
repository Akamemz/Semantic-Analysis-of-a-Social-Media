    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Betsy DeVos , a longtime school choice advocate and Republican mega-donor , to be his education secretary , he announced Wednesday .\nDeVos is best known in the school choice world as the chairwoman of the American Federation for Children , an advocacy and research organization that champions school vouchers and tax-credit scholarships . And just hours after her selection , DeVos sent a tweet making it clear that she adamantly opposes the Common Core State Standards , which Trump also has denounced .\n`` Betsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate , '' said President-elect Trump in a statement announcing the pick , which is still subject to U.S. Senate confirmation . `` Under her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families . ''\nHis statement echoes DeVos ' own rhetoric . Back in 2013 , she told Philanthropy magazine that a number of states\u2014including Indiana , Florida , and Arizona\u2014had begun to embrace school choice because `` traditional public schools are not succeeding . In fact , let 's be clear , in many cases , they are failing , '' she said .\nThe Education Department does n't play a particularly large role when it comes to actually funding and providing oversight for school choice , however , and it 's unclear how much DeVos and Trump would be able to change that .\nOn common core , Trump has called the standards a `` disaster '' and said he would like to get rid of them\u2014even though the Every Student Succeeds Act bars the federal government from telling states which standards they can or ca n't use . That language was added to the law as a rebuke to the Obama administration , which used money and promises of flexibility to encourage states to adopt the common core .\nIn a blog post , DeVos , who had previously supported the standards , said she was all for them when they were a state-level initiative , but that they 've become a `` federal boondogle . '' DeVos said she does `` support high standards , strong accountability , and local control . ''\nSen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , the chairman of the Senate education committee , called DeVos an `` excellent choice '' for education secretary .\n`` Betsy has worked for years to improve educational opportunities for all children , '' Alexander said in his statement . `` As secretary , she will be able to implement the new law fixing No Child Left Behind just as Congress wrote it , reversing the trend to a national school board and restoring to states , governors , school boards , teachers , and parents greater responsibility for improving education in their local communities . ''\nSen. Patty Murray , D-Wash. , the top Democrat on the committee , said she would be scrutinizing DeVos ' record closely .\n`` President-elect Trump has made a number of troubling statements over the course of his campaign on a range of issues that a future Secretary of Education will be charged with implementing and enforcing -- from education policy , to civil rights and equality of opportunity , to his personal views on sexual assault and harassment , and more , '' Murray said in her statement . `` Right now students , parents , teachers and school leaders across the country are demanding to know how his Secretary of Education will ensure the safety and respect of all students , of all backgrounds , all across this country -- and I will be focused throughout this process on how his nominee intends to do just that . ''\nBut the National Education Association , a 3-million member union , is also dismayed with the pick , and the message it sends about the direction of Trump 's education policy .\nDeVos has `` done more to undermine public education than support students , '' said Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda , the president of the NEA in a statement . `` She has lobbied for failed schemes , like vouchers\u2014which take away funding and local control from our public schools\u2014to fund private schools at taxpayers ' expense . These schemes do nothing to help our most-vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps . She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize , de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education . ''\nDeVos might not have been Trump 's first pick to the head the Education Department . Rev .

She served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party from 2003 to 2005 . She and her husband , Dick DeVos , successfully pushed for the passage of the Wolverine State 's charter school law in 1993 . However , Dick DeVos fell down in his 2000 push to amend to the Michigan Constitution to allow vouchers .\nDeVos and her husband gave $ 2.7 million to Republican candidates this election cycle and none to Democrats , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .\nDeVos said in the Philanthropy magazine interview that she was awakened to the power of school choice during a visit to the Potters House Christian School years ago , when she and her husband had school-age children .

The president-elect has floated a $ 20 billion school choice proposal on the campaign trail . He said the program would be financed through existing federal dollars , but did n't say where the money would come from , or how it would flow to states and districts .\nAnd it 's unclear if such an ambitious school choice proposal could make it through Congress .
