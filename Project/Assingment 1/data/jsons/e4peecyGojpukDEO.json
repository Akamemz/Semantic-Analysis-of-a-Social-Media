    "content": "The corporate owners of Mandalay Bay and the Route 91 Harvest festival venue have filed federal lawsuits against the victims of last year 's mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas , claiming that MGM Resorts International has zero liability in the deadly Oct. 1 incident .\nAccording to a new report published Monday , the company filed the complaints against the more than 1,000 shooting victims in federal courts in both Nevada and California , arguing that pending lawsuits against MGM should `` be dismissed . ''\n`` Plaintiffs have no liability of any kind to defendants , '' the complaints argue , per the Las Vegas Review-Journal .\nOne Las Vegas attorney representing victims slammed the resort owner 's filings as a `` blatant display of judge shopping '' that `` quite frankly verges on unethical . ''\n`` I 've never seen a more outrageous thing , where they sue the victims in an effort to find a judge they like , '' Robert Eglet told the Review-Journal . `` It 's just really sad that they would stoop to this level . ''\nOn Monday , a spokeswoman released a statement that framed MGM Resort International 's move as a win for the community at large .\n`` The Federal Court is an appropriate venue for these cases and provides those affected with the opportunity for a timely resolution , '' Debra DeShong said . `` Years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims , the community and those still healing . ''\nIn early October of last year , Mandalay Bay guest Stephen Paddock shot out the windows of his 32nd-floor room and opened fire on concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival .\nIn what is now considered to be the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history , Paddock killed 59 people and injured more than 800 .\nBy the time police reached him , Paddock had already killed himself . His motive remains unclear .\nLawsuits alleging that the festival did not have adequate exits and security or properly-trained staff have been filed against both MGM and concert promoter Live Nation , which some victims claim resulted in additional injuries and exposure to the gunman 's fire .\nThe legal argument behind MGM 's lawsuits relies on an interpretation of a federal law passed in the wake of 9/11 , according to USA Today :\nMGM claims the case must be dealt with in federal court under terms of the post-9/11 Safety Act , which provides incentives for development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies . The company says the security firm it contracted for the concert , CSC , was approved by the Department of Homeland Security and thus released from liability under the act . That release extends to the Mandalay Bay hotel , MGM says .\nIt is unclear , however , if MGM 's rationale would pass muster in court . As the Review-Journal points out , the Federal Bureau of Investigation never labeled Paddock 's crime as `` an act of terrorism '' :\nThe act cited in the new lawsuits was passed just more than a year after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and intentionally included broad protections . For instance , the act defines terrorism as any unlawful act inside the United States that causes \u201c mass destruction , injury or other loss. \u201d The FBI has not called the Las Vegas mass shooting an act of terrorism because the gunman had no clear motive , and the FBI defines terrorism as an act of terror associated with extremist ideologies of a political , religious , social , racial or environmental nature .\n`` Even if MGM is successful , that may not outweigh the adverse publicity for the company that the suit generates , '' Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond 's law school , told the outlet .",
