    "content": "Eugene Kiely , Brooks Jackson , Lori Robertson , Robert Farley and D \u2019 Angelo Gore\nCorrections & Clarifications : An earlier version of the article said that the Jan. 14 debate was the final debate before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses , but there is another Republican debate on Jan. 28 .\nOne of the final debates before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses contained old and new claims alike :\n\u2022 Sen. Ted Cruz , who was born in Canada , said the law was \u201c quite clear \u201d that the \u201c child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen \u201d and therefore eligible to be president . Legal consensus is on his side , but the issue isn \u2019 t settled and could require a Supreme Court ruling .\n\u2022 Sen. Marco Rubio and Cruz disagreed over whether Cruz \u2019 s tax plan , which relies on a 16 % tax on businesses , was a \u201c value-added tax \u201d or VAT , as Rubio said . Rubio is correct .\n\u2022 New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie repeated his claim that he \u201c didn \u2019 t support \u201d Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor . But in 2009 he said , \u201c I support her appointment , \u201d and he urged the Senate to confirm her , while saying he wouldn \u2019 t have nominated her .\n\u2022 Businessman Donald Trump described the Syrian refugees as mostly \u201c strong , powerful men. \u201d But most of the more than 4.6 million refugees registered with the United Nations are women and children .\n\u2022 Cruz repeated his claim that the Senate immigration bill that Rubio cosponsored would have given the president power to admit Syrian refugees \u201c without mandating meaningful background checks. \u201d The bill would have made it easier for members of certain groups to qualify as refugees , but they would still be subject to background checks .\n\u2022 Sen. Marco Rubio claimed that Cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally . But that depends on whether or not Cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization .\n\u2022 Christie also repeated his claim that \u201c we double tax \u201d U.S. companies with overseas operations . The U.S. tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid that .\n\u2022 Christie , Rubio and Ohio Gov . John Kasich all said that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world . It \u2019 s the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations , but not the highest marginal effective tax rate , according to one analysis .\n\u2022 In the earlier debate , former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum claimed 2 million manufacturing jobs had been lost under Obama . The number is actually 230,000 jobs lost .\n\u2022 Businesswoman Carly Fiorina said of the September 2012 Benghazi attacks : \u201c [ W ] hen you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack , terrorists assume it \u2019 s open season. \u201d The president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice .\nSeven GOP candidates met on the main stage on Jan. 14 : businessman Donald Trump , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , Sen. Marco Rubio , former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Sen. Ted Cruz , Ohio Gov . John Kasich and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie . The earlier undercard debate included former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum , businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee . The debate aired on Fox Business Network and was held in North Charleston , S.C .\nAsked about Trump questioning whether Cruz qualifies as a \u201c natural born citizen \u201d eligible to serve as president , Cruz said \u201c the facts and the law here are really quite clear : under longstanding U.S. law , the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen . \u201d\nWhen we wrote about the issue in March , we concluded that the legal consensus was on Cruz \u2019 s side . But the issue isn \u2019 t as settled as Cruz makes out . The Constitution does not define \u201c natural born , \u201d and the Supreme Court has not ruled on its precise meaning . And there are at least some constitutional scholars who believe Cruz is ineligible .\nTrump said he is convinced that if Cruz wins the Republican nomination , \u201c I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit . You have a big lawsuit over your head while you \u2019 re running . And if you become the nominee , who the hell knows if you can even serve in office ? So you should go out , get a declaratory judgment , let the courts decide . \u201d\nCruz \u2019 s birth certificate shows he was born in Calgary , Alberta , on Dec. 22 , 1970 , to an American mother and Cuban father . Cruz , who came to the U.S. at age 4 , is a citizen by birth because his mother was a U.S. citizen when he was born . But the U.S. Constitution requires a president to be not just a citizen , but a \u201c natural born Citizen . \u201d\nArticle II , Section 1 : No Person except a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States , at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the Office of President ; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years , and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States .\nIn 2013 , Sarah Helene Duggin , a Catholic University law professor , wrote : \u201c There is a strong argument that anyone who acquires United States citizenship at birth , whether by virtue of the 14th Amendment or by operation of federal statute , qualifies as natural born . \u201d\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reached a similar conclusion in 2011 .\nCRS , Nov. 14 , 2011 : The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term \u201c natural born \u201d citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \u201c by birth \u201d or \u201c at birth , \u201d either by being born \u201c in \u201d the United States and under its jurisdiction , even those born to alien parents ; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents ; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \u201c at birth. \u201d Such term , however , would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth , and who was thus born an \u201c alien \u201d required to go through the legal process of \u201c naturalization \u201d to become a U.S. citizen .\nAnd Neal Katyal and Paul Clement , two former U.S. solicitors general , writing for the Harvard Law Review , said that Cruz qualifies as a \u201c natural born Citizen . \u201d\nEarlier this week , TheWashington Post published an opinion piece by Mary Brigid McManamon , a constitutional law professor at Widener University \u2019 s Delaware Law School , in which she made the argument that Cruz is not eligible to be president .\nMcManamon , Jan. 12 : Cruz is , of course , a U.S. citizen . As he was born in Canada , he is not natural-born . His mother , however , is an American , and Congress has provided by statute for the naturalization of children born abroad to citizens . \u2026 But Article II of the Constitution expressly adopts the legal status of the natural-born citizen and requires that a president possess that status . However we feel about allowing naturalized immigrants to reach for the stars , the Constitution must be amended before one of them can attain the office of president . Congress simply does not have the power to convert someone born outside the United States into a natural-born citizen . \u2026 When discussing the meaning of a constitutional term , it is important to go beyond secondary sources and look to the law itself . And on this issue , the law is clear : The framers of the Constitution required the president of the United States to be born in the United States .\nDuring the debate , Trump repeatedly referred to another legal scholar , Laurence Tribe , a constitutional law professor at Harvard who once had Cruz as a student .\nIn an opinion piece penned for the Boston Globe on Jan. 11 , Tribe opined that while \u201c no real court is likely to keep Cruz off the ballot , much less remove him from the White House if he were to win , \u201d the kind of \u201c originalist \u201d judges that Cruz has said he would appoint to the Supreme Court are the very ones most likely to conclude he is ineligible .\nTribe , Jan. 11 : People are entitled to their own opinions about what the definition ought to be . But the kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court is an \u201c originalist , \u201d one who claims to be bound by the narrowly historical meaning of the Constitution \u2019 s terms at the time of their adoption . To his kind of judge , Cruz ironically wouldn \u2019 t be eligible , because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and \u2019 90s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \u201c natural born \u201d citizen . Even having two US parents wouldn \u2019 t suffice . And having just an American mother , as Cruz did , would have been insufficient at a time that made patrilineal descent decisive . \u2026 On the other hand , the kind of judge I admire and Cruz abhors is a \u201c living constitutionalist , \u201d one who believes that the Constitution \u2019 s meaning evolves with the perceived needs of the time and longstanding practice . To that kind of judge , Cruz would be eligible to serve because it no longer makes sense to be bound by the narrow historical definition that would disqualify him .\nCruz described Tribe as \u201c a left-wing judicial activist , Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore \u2019 s lawyer in Bush versus Gore . He \u2019 s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. \u201d Tribe once argued on Al Gore \u2019 s behalf at the Supreme Court about the results of the 2000 presidential election . According to CNN , Tribe is \u201c certainly a voice in liberal politics , though not \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 a formal backer of Clinton . \u201d\nBut Tribe didn \u2019 t say he thinks Cruz is ineligible , only that he thinks Cruz is \u201c a fair weather originalist \u201d when it comes to interpreting the Constitution \u2019 s definition of \u201c natural born . \u201d\nCruz said that \u201c under longstanding U.S. law , the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen. \u201d Ultimately , the issue might have to go to the Supreme Court . As we wrote in March , even Duggin , who wrote in her 2013 article that \u201c [ a ] scholarly consensus is emerging \u2026 that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of Article II , \u201d acknowledged that the issue may not be settled .\n\u201c In the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling \u2014 or a constitutional amendment \u2014 the parameters of the clause remain uncertain , \u201d she wrote .\nRubio and Cruz tangled on the Texan \u2019 s tax plan , which relies on a 16 % tax to be paid by businesses . Rubio said Cruz was proposing a \u201c value-added tax \u201d or VAT , of the kind Ronald Reagan opposed .\nRubio : Ronald Reagan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people , so the true cost of government was not there for them .\nCruz responded by denying that he was proposing a VAT :\nCruz : [ T ] he business flat tax in my proposal is not a VAT . A VAT is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good .\nAs a practical matter , we find Rubio was correct , and Cruz misled when he denied that his proposal amounted to a VAT .\nDon \u2019 t take our word for it . The nonpartisan , business-funded Tax Foundation has described the Cruz proposal as a \u201c subtraction method value-added tax , \u201d and the conservative National Review also describes it as a VAT , period .\nWhat Cruz proposes is to eliminate both the corporate income tax ( which falls on net profits ) and the payroll tax , substituting a 16 % tax on businesses \u201c on revenues minus expenses such as equipment , computers , and other business investments. \u201d Not mentioned is that the Cruz tax would fall on what businesses pay their employees , and would tend to be passed along and paid by consumers in the form of higher prices .\nCruz prefers to call his plan a \u201c Business Flat Tax , \u201d but as the Tax Foundation \u2019 s analysis stated , \u201c its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries [ except that ] it is calculated from corporate accounts , not on individual transactions . \u201d\nThe Tax Foundation said its computer model predicts that the Cruz plan would boost economic growth and wages over the long term . But some conservatives worry that voters won \u2019 t know how much they are paying .\n\u201c It is the hidden nature of this tax that has traditionally worried conservatives , \u201d the National Review wrote in a Jan. 13 editorial . \u201c Most people would not know what their wages would have bought them if this tax were lower , or if it did not exist. \u201d It was that criticism that Rubio echoed in his debate remarks .\nCruz also exaggerated when he claimed that his tax plan had been called \u201c the best \u201d by Reagan \u2019 s \u201c chief economic adviser . \u201d\nCruz : I would note that Art Laffer , Ronald Reagan \u2019 s chief economic adviser , has written publicly , that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage .\nIt \u2019 s true that economist Arthur Laffer coauthored a Nov. 20 Investor \u2019 s Business Daily article naming the tax plans of Cruz \u2014 and the flat-tax plan offered by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 as the \u201c best tax proposals. \u201d Since Paul was excluded from the Fox Business News debate , he wasn \u2019 t on the stage when Cruz made his claim . So Cruz is technically accurate on that score .\nHowever , Laffer was never Reagan \u2019 s \u201c chief \u201d economic adviser , nor was he even a member of Reagan \u2019 s White House Council of Economic Advisers . Laffer was instead one of a dozen members of an \u201c Economic Policy Advisory Board \u201d that Reagan named soon after taking office , and which was directed to meet \u201c every 3 or 4 months . \u201d\nAnd by the way , even the Laffer article flatly called the Cruz plan a value-added tax , referring to \u201c the Cruz and Paul VATs . \u201d\nChristie repeated the claim that he \u201c didn \u2019 t support [ Supreme Court Justice ] Sonia Sotomayor. \u201d During the confirmation process in 2009 , Christie said he wouldn \u2019 t have nominated Sotomayor but that \u201c I support her confirmation. \u201d And he urged the Senate to confirm her .\nRubio brought up the subject , saying that Christie had supported Sotomayor \u2019 s appointment . This is the second time Christie denied supporting her this week : As we wrote , he said on Sunday \u2019 s Face the Nation that he \u201c didn \u2019 t voice support for Sonia Sotomayor . \u201d\nHis statement in 2009 \u2014 when he was a candidate for governor in New Jersey \u2014 might have had a caveat , but it certainly was support . The website PolitickerNJ carried Christie \u2019 s statement at the time , which said , \u201c After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor \u2019 s performance at the confirmation hearings this week , I am confident that she is qualified for the position of Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . \u2026 While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice , President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability , competence and ability . I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination . \u201d\nChristie and Rubio also disagreed over whether Christie had ever given a donation to Planned Parenthood . We can \u2019 t say whether Christie did or didn \u2019 t . Christie was quoted in the Newark Star-Ledger in 1994 as saying he did support the nonprofit \u201c privately with my personal contribution. \u201d He now says he was misquoted .\nThe 1994 story was written by Brian T. Murray , who is currently the governor \u2019 s spokesman . At the time , Christie was a candidate for a county freeholder seat and said he was opposed to restoring funding to Planned Parenthood . \u201c I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency , to find private donations , \u201d he was quoted as saying .\nChristie \u2019 s campaign told us there is no record of such a donation , but there wouldn \u2019 t be one , since nonprofits are not required to disclose donations .\nHe toldTheWashington Post on Jan. 12 that he was \u201c convinced \u201d the 22-year-old comment \u201c was a misquote . \u201d\nTrump painted a distorted picture of the demographics of the Syrian refugees as mostly \u201c strong , powerful men . \u201d\nTrump was asked about President Obama pointing during his State of the Union address to a Syrian refugee now living near Detroit \u2014 a man with a doctorate degree whose wife and daughter were killed by a Syrian government anti-personnel missile .\n\u201c When I look at the migration , I looked at the line \u2026 where are the women ? It looked like very few women . Very few children , \u201d Trump responded . \u201c Strong , powerful men , young and people are looking at that and they \u2019 re saying what \u2019 s going on ? \u201d\nAs we have writtenbefore , most of the more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees registered with the United Nations are women and children . According to the U.N. , as of Dec. 31 , about half of them ( 50.7 % ) are women . Another 20 % are males under the age of 12 . Just 21.4 % are males age 18 to 59 .\nIn November , when we asked the administration for a demographic breakdown of Syrian refugees who are seeking to resettle in the U.S. , it provided a chart that shows 23,826 total applicants \u2014 15,937 , or 67 % , of whom are women ( of all ages ) and male children ( age 0 to 11 ) . Men ( age 18 and older ) accounted for 25.5 % . That closely mirrors the demographic breakdown of the Syrian refugee population at large .\nCruz said that the Senate immigration bill that Rubio cosponsored \u201c expanded Barack Obama \u2019 s power to let in Syrian refugees \u2026 without mandating meaningful background checks. \u201d The bill , S. 744 , would have made it easier for members of certain groups designated by the president to qualify as refugees , but they would still be subject to the same required screening process as other refugees before they could come to the U.S .\nCruz : It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill , one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama \u2019 s power to let in Syrian refugees . It enabled him \u2014 the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks .\nThe bill , which was also cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer , did not specifically mention refugees from Syria . Section 3403 authorized the president to declare certain groups with common characteristics as refugees for special humanitarian purposes . In order to qualify for refugee status , individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president .\nThat differs from current law , which says that individuals applying to come to the U.S. as refugees must demonstrate that they can \u2019 t or won \u2019 t return to their home country because of \u201c persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . \u201d\nSo , in theory , the president could declare Syrians as a special group eligible for admission to the U.S. as refugees .\nHowever , they would still have to undergo the same security screening process as all other individuals applying to come to the U.S. as refugees . That includes a background check , whether Cruz thinks it is \u201c meaningful \u201d or not .\n\u201c Even if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out ( including having a specific vulnerability , justified in the national interest , etc . ) and be designated as a group , they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees , \u201d said Joanne Kelsey , assistant director for advocacy with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service , in an email to FactCheck.org .\nRubio revived an attack line from the last Republican debate , claiming that Cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally . But as we wrote before , whether that \u2019 s true depends on whether one believes Cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization .\nRubio addressed Cruz during the most recent debate saying , \u201c You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally , now you say you \u2019 re against it . \u201d\nDuring the December debate , Cruz said unequivocally , \u201c I have never supported legalization , and I do not intend to support legalization . \u201d\nBut Rubio contends that he did in the midst of a contentious Senate battle over comprehensive immigration legislation back in 2013 .\nIn 2013 , Cruz offered an amendment to a Senate immigration bill that would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally . But Cruz \u2019 s amendment would have purposefully left intact the bill \u2019 s provisions to provide legal status for them . Numerous media outlets described Cruz \u2019 s plan as a compromise \u201c middle road \u201d in the immigration debate that he hoped might be palatable to enough legislators in both houses of Congress to actually pass .\nCruz publicly opposed S. 744 , the Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act , because it provided a \u201c path to citizenship \u201d for those currently in the country illegally . Cruz labeled it an \u201c amnesty \u201d bill , and he criticized Rubio for cosponsoring it .\nAlthough Cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment , Cruz \u2019 s campaign told us the amendment was a ploy to expose the real motivations of the bill \u2019 s supporters . While those supporters claimed the bill \u2019 s aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows , the Cruz campaign says Cruz was convinced the actual intent was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could become future voters . So , the campaign says , Cruz offered the amendment , knowing it would not pass , to show the real priority of supporters . Even if the amendment had been accepted , Cruz still would not have supported the bill , the campaign says , because he opposes legalization .\nAs we said in December , we \u2019 ll leave it up to readers to decide whether Cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise , and now disavows it , or whether he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents .\nChristie was wrong when he claimed \u201c we double tax \u201d U.S. companies with overseas operations . The fact is , the U.S. tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid exactly what Christie claimed is happening .\nChristie : They pay tax once overseas . They don \u2019 t want to pay 35 % tax on the way back .\nThe U.S. statutory corporate tax rate is 35 % , as Christie said . And the U.S. has what is known as a \u201c worldwide approach , \u201d which as explained by the Congressional Budget Office , taxes all income \u201c regardless of where that income is earned. \u201d But , as the CBO says , the U.S. typically provides a foreign tax credit \u201c to avoid taxing income twice . \u201d\nThe foreign tax credit is subtracted from taxes that would otherwise be owed , on line 5a of the corporate tax return form 1120 . IRS instructions define taxes eligible for a credit as those \u201c paid or accrued during the tax year to any foreign country or U.S. possession . \u201d\n\u201c This results in their paying tax at the US rate , not double taxation , \u201d Eric Toder , a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who was the director of research at the IRS from 2001 to 2004 , told us when we first wrote about this in June .\nChristie , Rubio and Kasich all said that the U.S. has the highest corporate or business tax rate in the world . The highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations , yes . But perhaps not the highest marginal effective tax rate , according to one analysis .\nKasich : If you cut taxes for corporations , and you cut taxes for individuals , you \u2019 re going to make things move , particularly the corporate tax , which is the highest , of course , in the \u2014 in the world . Christie : If you reform the corporate tax system in this country , which , as was mentioned before , is the highest rate in the world . Rubio : It begins with tax reform . Let \u2019 s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world . Let \u2019 s allow companies to immediately expense .\nNeither Christie , Kasich or Rubio specified which corporate tax rate they were talking about . There are different measurements .\nThe U.S. has the highest statutory rate , 39.1 % , among the 34 industrialized nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , according to the nonpartisan , pro-business Tax Foundation .\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center defines the statutory rate as the \u201c rate that is imposed on taxable income of corporations , which is equal to corporate receipts less deductions for labor costs , materials , and depreciation of capital assets . \u201d\nChad ( 40 % ) and the United Arab Emirates ( 55 % ) , two non-OECD member nations , actually have higher rates than the U.S. , according to the Tax Foundation .\nBut the Tax Policy Center says that the marginal effective tax rate , which assesses how much the corporate tax reduces the rate of return on new investment , \u201c is consequently the best measure of how taxes affect a firm \u2019 s incentive to invest . \u201d\nAnd the U.S. marginal effective tax rate is 35.3 % , according to the most recent Tax Foundation analysis . That is second to France \u2019 s rate of 36 % , among OECD nations . And it puts the U.S. in sixth place , behind Argentina ( 43.5 % ) , Chad ( 37.2 % ) , Uzbekistan ( 37.1 % ) , Colombia ( 36.6 % ) and France , among 95 nations reviewed for the Tax Foundation study .\nIn the earlier debate , former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum claimed that the U.S. has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under President Obama . That \u2019 s way off . The net loss of manufacturing jobs , as of December , was 230,000 .\nSantorum twice used the 2 million figure , including a second time when challenged by debate moderator Sandra Smith .\nSmith : Sen. Santorum , I want to stay with you on this , moving to jobs and the economy . In his State of the Union address the other night , President Obama touted his record on jobs , citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years . Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs ? Santorum : Well , the numbers just don \u2019 t add up . I mean , they have not added manufacturing jobs . Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country , 2 million of them . The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most .\nAs we said in our story on Obama \u2019 s State of the Union address , Obama was largely correct in saying the U.S. has created nearly 900,000 jobs in the last six years . But that ignores the earlier job losses during his time in office . There has been a net loss of 230,000 over the entire seven years of his presidency , dropping from 12,561,000 jobs in January 2009 to 12,331,000 in December 2015 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nAt its lowest point , the number of manufacturing jobs under Obama stood at 11,453,000 in February 2010 \u2014 1.1 million off the peak in January 2009 . That \u2019 s nearly half as many as Santorum claimed and most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of those jobs have been recovered .\nAlso in the undercard debate , Fiorina criticized the Obama administration \u2019 s response to the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi that resulted in four deaths , including that of U.S . Ambassador Christopher Stevens .\n\u201c [ W ] hen you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack , terrorists assume it \u2019 s open season , \u201d Fiorina said .\nThe fact is , the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice in a Rose Garden speech on the morning after the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack .\n\u201c And make no mistake , we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people , \u201d Obama said at one point .\nLater in his speech , he also said : \u201c We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act . And make no mistake , justice will be done . \u201d\nSimilarly , that same day , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at the State Department and vowed that the U.S. would not \u201c rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice . \u201d\nTwo days later , Obama spoke at a ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base when the remains of the Benghazi victims were returned to the U.S . In that speech , Obama said : \u201c To you \u2014 their families and colleagues \u2014 to all Americans , know this : Their sacrifice will never be forgotten . We will bring to justice those who took them from us . \u201d\nRubio comes out swinging at Cruz as debate nears end\nTrump uses 9/11 to counter Cruz 's 'New York values ' attack",

Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada, said the law was \u201cquite clear\u201d that the \u201cchild of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen\u201d and therefore eligible to be president. Legal consensus is on his side, but the issue isn\u2019t settled and could require a Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u2022 Sen. Marco Rubio and Cruz disagreed over whether Cruz\u2019s tax plan, which relies on a 16% tax on businesses, was a \u201cvalue-added tax\u201d or VAT, as Rubio said. Rubio is correct.\n\n\u2022 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie repeated his claim that he \u201cdidn\u2019t support\u201d Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. But in 2009 he said, \u201cI support her appointment,\u201d and he urged the Senate to confirm her, while saying he wouldn\u2019t have nominated her.\n\n\u2022 Businessman Donald Trump described the Syrian refugees as mostly \u201cstrong, powerful men.\u201d But most of the more than 4.6 million refugees registered with the United Nations are women and children.\n\n\u2022 Cruz repeated his claim that the Senate immigration bill that Rubio cosponsored would have given the president power to admit Syrian refugees \u201cwithout mandating meaningful background checks.\u201d The bill would have made it easier for members of certain groups to qualify as refugees, but they would still be subject to background checks.\n\n\u2022 Sen. Marco Rubio claimed that Cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally. But that depends on whether or not Cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization.\n\n\u2022 Christie also repeated his claim that \u201cwe double tax\u201d U.S. companies with overseas operations. The U.S. tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid that.\n\n\u2022 Christie, Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all said that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. It\u2019s the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations, but not the highest marginal effective tax rate, according to one analysis.\n\n\u2022 In the earlier debate, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum claimed 2 million manufacturing jobs had been lost under Obama. The number is actually 230,000 jobs lost.\n\n\u2022 Businesswoman Carly Fiorina said of the September 2012 Benghazi attacks: \u201c[W]hen you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season.\u201d The president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice.\n\nSeven GOP candidates met on the main stage on Jan. 14: businessman Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The earlier undercard debate included former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. The debate aired on Fox Business Network and was held in North Charleston, S.C.\n\nCruz\u2019s Eligibility\n\nAsked about Trump questioning whether Cruz qualifies as a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d eligible to serve as president, Cruz said \u201cthe facts and the law here are really quite clear: under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.\u201d\n\nWhen we wrote about the issue in March, we concluded that the legal consensus was on Cruz\u2019s side. But the issue isn\u2019t as settled as Cruz makes out. The Constitution does not define \u201cnatural born,\u201d and the Supreme Court has not ruled on its precise meaning. And there are at least some constitutional scholars who believe Cruz is ineligible.\n\nTrump said he is convinced that if Cruz wins the Republican nomination, \u201cI already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you\u2019re running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s birth certificate shows he was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, to an American mother and Cuban father. Cruz, who came to the U.S. at age 4, is a citizen by birth because his mother was a U.S. citizen when he was born. But the U.S. Constitution requires a president to be not just a citizen, but a \u201cnatural born Citizen.\u201d\n\nArticle II, Section 1: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\n\nIn 2013, Sarah Helene Duggin, a Catholic University law professor, wrote: \u201cThere is a strong argument that anyone who acquires United States citizenship at birth, whether by virtue of the 14th Amendment or by operation of federal statute, qualifies as natural born.\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reached a similar conclusion in 2011.\n\nCRS, Nov. 14, 2011: The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \u201cby birth\u201d or \u201cat birth,\u201d either by being born \u201cin\u201d the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \u201cat birth.\u201d Such term, however, would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth, and who was thus born an \u201calien\u201d required to go through the legal process of \u201cnaturalization\u201d to become a U.S. citizen.\n\nAnd Neal Katyal and Paul Clement, two former U.S. solicitors general, writing for the Harvard Law Review, said that Cruz qualifies as a \u201cnatural born Citizen.\u201d\n\nBut there are other legal scholars who disagree.\n\nEarlier this week, TheWashington Post published an opinion piece by Mary Brigid McManamon, a constitutional law professor at Widener University\u2019s Delaware Law School, in which she made the argument that Cruz is not eligible to be president.\n\nMcManamon, Jan. 12: Cruz is, of course, a U.S. citizen. As he was born in Canada, he is not natural-born. His mother, however, is an American, and Congress has provided by statute for the naturalization of children born abroad to citizens. \u2026 But Article II of the Constitution expressly adopts the legal status of the natural-born citizen and requires that a president possess that status. However we feel about allowing naturalized immigrants to reach for the stars, the Constitution must be amended before one of them can attain the office of president. Congress simply does not have the power to convert someone born outside the United States into a natural-born citizen. \u2026 When discussing the meaning of a constitutional term, it is important to go beyond secondary sources and look to the law itself. And on this issue, the law is clear: The framers of the Constitution required the president of the United States to be born in the United States.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump repeatedly referred to another legal scholar, Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard who once had Cruz as a student.\n\nIn an opinion piece penned for the Boston Globe on Jan. 11, Tribe opined that while \u201cno real court is likely to keep Cruz off the ballot, much less remove him from the White House if he were to win,\u201d the kind of \u201coriginalist\u201d judges that Cruz has said he would appoint to the Supreme Court are the very ones most likely to conclude he is ineligible.\n\nTribe, Jan. 11: People are entitled to their own opinions about what the definition ought to be. But the kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court is an \u201coriginalist,\u201d one who claims to be bound by the narrowly historical meaning of the Constitution\u2019s terms at the time of their adoption. To his kind of judge, Cruz ironically wouldn\u2019t be eligible, because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and \u201990s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen. Even having two US parents wouldn\u2019t suffice. And having just an American mother, as Cruz did, would have been insufficient at a time that made patrilineal descent decisive. \u2026 On the other hand, the kind of judge I admire and Cruz abhors is a \u201cliving constitutionalist,\u201d one who believes that the Constitution\u2019s meaning evolves with the perceived needs of the time and longstanding practice. To that kind of judge, Cruz would be eligible to serve because it no longer makes sense to be bound by the narrow historical definition that would disqualify him.\n\nCruz described Tribe as \u201ca left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore\u2019s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He\u2019s a major Hillary Clinton supporter.\u201d Tribe once argued on Al Gore\u2019s behalf at the Supreme Court about the results of the 2000 presidential election. According to CNN, Tribe is \u201ccertainly a voice in liberal politics, though not \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 a formal backer of Clinton.\u201d\n\nBut Tribe didn\u2019t say he thinks Cruz is ineligible, only that he thinks Cruz is \u201ca fair weather originalist\u201d when it comes to interpreting the Constitution\u2019s definition of \u201cnatural born.\u201d\n\nCruz said that \u201cunder longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.\u201d Ultimately, the issue might have to go to the Supreme Court. As we wrote in March, even Duggin, who wrote in her 2013 article that \u201c[a] scholarly consensus is emerging \u2026 that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of Article II,\u201d acknowledged that the issue may not be settled.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling \u2014 or a constitutional amendment \u2014 the parameters of the clause remain uncertain,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe VAT Spat\n\nRubio and Cruz tangled on the Texan\u2019s tax plan, which relies on a 16% tax to be paid by businesses. Rubio said Cruz was proposing a \u201cvalue-added tax\u201d or VAT, of the kind Ronald Reagan opposed.\n\nRubio: Ronald Reagan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there for them.\n\nCruz responded by denying that he was proposing a VAT:\n\nCruz: [T]he business flat tax in my proposal is not a VAT. A VAT is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.\n\nAs a practical matter, we find Rubio was correct, and Cruz misled when he denied that his proposal amounted to a VAT.\n\nDon\u2019t take our word for it. The nonpartisan, business-funded Tax Foundation has described the Cruz proposal as a \u201csubtraction method value-added tax,\u201d and the conservative National Review also describes it as a VAT, period.\n\nWhat Cruz proposes is to eliminate both the corporate income tax (which falls on net profits) and the payroll tax, substituting a 16% tax on businesses \u201con revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments.\u201d Not mentioned is that the Cruz tax would fall on what businesses pay their employees, and would tend to be passed along and paid by consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nCruz prefers to call his plan a \u201cBusiness Flat Tax,\u201d but as the Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis stated, \u201cits base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries [except that] it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Foundation said its computer model predicts that the Cruz plan would boost economic growth and wages over the long term. But some conservatives worry that voters won\u2019t know how much they are paying.\n\n\u201cIt is the hidden nature of this tax that has traditionally worried conservatives,\u201d the National Review wrote in a Jan. 13 editorial. \u201cMost people would not know what their wages would have bought them if this tax were lower, or if it did not exist.\u201d It was that criticism that Rubio echoed in his debate remarks.\n\nCruz also exaggerated when he claimed that his tax plan had been called \u201cthe best\u201d by Reagan\u2019s \u201cchief economic adviser.\u201d\n\nCruz: I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage.\n\nIt\u2019s true that economist Arthur Laffer coauthored a Nov. 20 Investor\u2019s Business Daily article naming the tax plans of Cruz \u2014 and the flat-tax plan offered by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 as the \u201cbest tax proposals.\u201d Since Paul was excluded from the Fox Business News debate, he wasn\u2019t on the stage when Cruz made his claim. So Cruz is technically accurate on that score.\n\nHowever, Laffer was never Reagan\u2019s \u201cchief\u201d economic adviser, nor was he even a member of Reagan\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers. Laffer was instead one of a dozen members of an \u201cEconomic Policy Advisory Board\u201d that Reagan named soon after taking office, and which was directed to meet \u201cevery 3 or 4 months.\u201d\n\nAnd by the way, even the Laffer article flatly called the Cruz plan a value-added tax, referring to \u201cthe Cruz and Paul VATs .\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s Sotomayor Denial\n\nChristie repeated the claim that he \u201cdidn\u2019t support [Supreme Court Justice] Sonia Sotomayor.\u201d During the confirmation process in 2009, Christie said he wouldn\u2019t have nominated Sotomayor but that \u201cI support her confirmation.\u201d And he urged the Senate to confirm her.\n\nRubio brought up the subject, saying that Christie had supported Sotomayor\u2019s appointment. This is the second time Christie denied supporting her this week: As we wrote, he said on Sunday\u2019s Face the Nation that he \u201cdidn\u2019t voice support for Sonia Sotomayor.\u201d\n\nHis statement in 2009 \u2014 when he was a candidate for governor in New Jersey \u2014 might have had a caveat, but it certainly was support. The website PolitickerNJ carried Christie\u2019s statement at the time, which said, \u201cAfter watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor\u2019s performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. \u2026 While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability. I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.\u201d\n\nChristie and Rubio also disagreed over whether Christie had ever given a donation to Planned Parenthood. We can\u2019t say whether Christie did or didn\u2019t. Christie was quoted in the Newark Star-Ledger in 1994 as saying he did support the nonprofit \u201cprivately with my personal contribution.\u201d He now says he was misquoted.\n\nThe 1994 story was written by Brian T. Murray, who is currently the governor\u2019s spokesman. At the time, Christie was a candidate for a county freeholder seat and said he was opposed to restoring funding to Planned Parenthood. \u201cI support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign told us there is no record of such a donation, but there wouldn\u2019t be one, since nonprofits are not required to disclose donations.\n\nHe toldTheWashington Post on Jan. 12 that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d the 22-year-old comment \u201cwas a misquote.\u201d\n\nTrump on Syrian Refugees\n\nTrump painted a distorted picture of the demographics of the Syrian refugees as mostly \u201cstrong, powerful men.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked about President Obama pointing during his State of the Union address to a Syrian refugee now living near Detroit \u2014 a man with a doctorate degree whose wife and daughter were killed by a Syrian government anti-personnel missile.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the migration, I looked at the line \u2026 where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cStrong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they\u2019re saying what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nAs we have writtenbefore, most of the more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees registered with the United Nations are women and children. According to the U.N., as of Dec. 31, about half of them (50.7%) are women. Another 20% are males under the age of 12. Just 21.4% are males age 18 to 59.\n\nIn November, when we asked the administration for a demographic breakdown of Syrian refugees who are seeking to resettle in the U.S., it provided a chart that shows 23,826 total applicants \u2014 15,937, or 67%, of whom are women (of all ages) and male children (age 0 to 11). Men (age 18 and older) accounted for 25.5%. That closely mirrors the demographic breakdown of the Syrian refugee population at large.\n\nCruz Wrong on Senate Immigration Bill\n\nCruz said that the Senate immigration bill that Rubio cosponsored \u201cexpanded Barack Obama\u2019s power to let in Syrian refugees \u2026 without mandating meaningful background checks.\u201d The bill, S. 744, would have made it easier for members of certain groups designated by the president to qualify as refugees, but they would still be subject to the same required screening process as other refugees before they could come to the U.S.\n\nCruz: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama\u2019s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him \u2014 the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.\n\nThe bill, which was also cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, did not specifically mention refugees from Syria. Section 3403 authorized the president to declare certain groups with common characteristics as refugees for special humanitarian purposes. In order to qualify for refugee status, individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president.\n\nThat differs from current law, which says that individuals applying to come to the U.S. as refugees must demonstrate that they can\u2019t or won\u2019t return to their home country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\nSo, in theory, the president could declare Syrians as a special group eligible for admission to the U.S. as refugees.\n\nHowever, they would still have to undergo the same security screening process as all other individuals applying to come to the U.S. as refugees. That includes a background check, whether Cruz thinks it is \u201cmeaningful\u201d or not.\n\n\u201cEven if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out (including having a specific vulnerability, justified in the national interest, etc.) and be designated as a group, they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees,\u201d said Joanne Kelsey, assistant director for advocacy with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nDid Cruz Support Legalization?\n\nRubio revived an attack line from the last Republican debate, claiming that Cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally. But as we wrote before, whether that\u2019s true depends on whether one believes Cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization.\n\nRubio addressed Cruz during the most recent debate saying, \u201cYou used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you\u2019re against it.\u201d\n\nDuring the December debate, Cruz said unequivocally, \u201cI have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio contends that he did in the midst of a contentious Senate battle over comprehensive immigration legislation back in 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Cruz offered an amendment to a Senate immigration bill that would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally. But Cruz\u2019s amendment would have purposefully left intact the bill\u2019s provisions to provide legal status for them. Numerous media outlets described Cruz\u2019s plan as a compromise \u201cmiddle road\u201d in the immigration debate that he hoped might be palatable to enough legislators in both houses of Congress to actually pass.\n\nCruz publicly opposed S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, because it provided a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for those currently in the country illegally. Cruz labeled it an \u201camnesty\u201d bill, and he criticized Rubio for cosponsoring it.\n\nAlthough Cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment, Cruz\u2019s campaign told us the amendment was a ploy to expose the real motivations of the bill\u2019s supporters. While those supporters claimed the bill\u2019s aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows, the Cruz campaign says Cruz was convinced the actual intent was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could become future voters. So, the campaign says, Cruz offered the amendment, knowing it would not pass, to show the real priority of supporters. Even if the amendment had been accepted, Cruz still would not have supported the bill, the campaign says, because he opposes legalization.\n\nAs we said in December, we\u2019ll leave it up to readers to decide whether Cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise, and now disavows it, or whether he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents.\n\nChristie Wrong on Double Taxation\n\nChristie was wrong when he claimed \u201cwe double tax\u201d U.S. companies with overseas operations. The fact is, the U.S. tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid exactly what Christie claimed is happening.\n\nChristie: They pay tax once overseas. They don\u2019t want to pay 35% tax on the way back.\n\nThe U.S. statutory corporate tax rate is 35%, as Christie said. And the U.S. has what is known as a \u201cworldwide approach,\u201d which as explained by the Congressional Budget Office, taxes all income \u201cregardless of where that income is earned.\u201d But, as the CBO says, the U.S. typically provides a foreign tax credit \u201cto avoid taxing income twice.\u201d\n\nThe foreign tax credit is subtracted from taxes that would otherwise be owed, on line 5a of the corporate tax return form 1120. IRS instructions define taxes eligible for a credit as those \u201cpaid or accrued during the tax year to any foreign country or U.S. possession.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis results in their paying tax at the US rate, not double taxation,\u201d Eric Toder, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who was the director of research at the IRS from 2001 to 2004, told us when we first wrote about this in June.\n\nHighest Corporate Tax Rate?\n\nChristie, Rubio and Kasich all said that the U.S. has the highest corporate or business tax rate in the world. The highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations, yes. But perhaps not the highest marginal effective tax rate, according to one analysis.\n\nKasich: If you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you\u2019re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the \u2014 in the world. Christie: If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world. Rubio: It begins with tax reform. Let\u2019s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let\u2019s allow companies to immediately expense.\n\nNeither Christie, Kasich or Rubio specified which corporate tax rate they were talking about. There are different measurements.\n\nThe U.S. has the highest statutory rate, 39.1%, among the 34 industrialized nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to the nonpartisan, pro-business Tax Foundation.\n\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center defines the statutory rate as the \u201crate that is imposed on taxable income of corporations, which is equal to corporate receipts less deductions for labor costs, materials, and depreciation of capital assets.\u201d\n\nChad (40%) and the United Arab Emirates (55%), two non-OECD member nations, actually have higher rates than the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nBut the Tax Policy Center says that the marginal effective tax rate, which assesses how much the corporate tax reduces the rate of return on new investment, \u201cis consequently the best measure of how taxes affect a firm\u2019s incentive to invest.\u201d\n\nAnd the U.S. marginal effective tax rate is 35.3%, according to the most recent Tax Foundation analysis. That is second to France\u2019s rate of 36%, among OECD nations. And it puts the U.S. in sixth place, behind Argentina (43.5%), Chad (37.2%), Uzbekistan (37.1%), Colombia (36.6%) and France, among 95 nations reviewed for the Tax Foundation study.\n\nSantorum Inflates Manufacturing Job Losses\n\nIn the earlier debate, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum claimed that the U.S. has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under President Obama. That\u2019s way off. The net loss of manufacturing jobs, as of December, was 230,000.\n\nSantorum twice used the 2 million figure, including a second time when challenged by debate moderator Sandra Smith.\n\nSmith: Sen. Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years. Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs? Santorum: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.\n\nAs we said in our story on Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, Obama was largely correct in saying the U.S. has created nearly 900,000 jobs in the last six years. But that ignores the earlier job losses during his time in office. There has been a net loss of 230,000 over the entire seven years of his presidency, dropping from 12,561,000 jobs in January 2009 to 12,331,000 in December 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut Santorum\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up at all.\n\nAt its lowest point, the number of manufacturing jobs under Obama stood at 11,453,000 in February 2010 \u2014 1.1 million off the peak in January 2009. That\u2019s nearly half as many as Santorum claimed and most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of those jobs have been recovered.\n\nFiorina\u2019s Benghazi Falsehood\n\nAlso in the undercard debate, Fiorina criticized the Obama administration\u2019s response to the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi that resulted in four deaths, including that of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\n\n\u201c[W]hen you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nThe fact is, the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice in a Rose Garden speech on the morning after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack.\n\n\u201cAnd make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people,\u201d Obama said at one point.\n\nLater in his speech, he also said: \u201cWe will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, that same day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at the State Department and vowed that the U.S. would not \u201crest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Obama spoke at a ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base when the remains of the Benghazi victims were returned to the U.S. In that speech, Obama said: \u201cTo you \u2014 their families and colleagues \u2014 to all Americans, know this: Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.
