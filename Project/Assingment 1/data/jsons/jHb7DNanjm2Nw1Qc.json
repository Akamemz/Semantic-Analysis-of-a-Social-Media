That \u2019 s likely to be truer in 2020 than ever before .\nJohn Hickenlooper , Amy Klobuchar , John Delaney , Eric Swalwell , Steve Bullock \u2014 those are just a few of the candidates who need a strong finish in the Feb. 3 , 2020 , caucuses to realistically move on .\nBeto O \u2019 Rourke is among those signaling a strong finish in Iowa is crucial . The former Texas congressman chose it for his first stop after announcing his presidential campaign and has already held 67 town halls and other public events in 36 of the state \u2019 s 99 counties . His trip there this week was his fourth since joining the race in mid-March .\nDespite that relatively late start , O \u2019 Rourke has quickly assembled a 16-staffer Iowa operation led by Norm Sterzenbach , a former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party who is steeped in caucus mechanics .\nJoe Biden , who failed to make it out of Iowa during his 2008 bid but is the 2020 front-runner , is another candidate whose campaign would crater in the face of a weak Iowa performance .\nExpectations are especially high for him , according to early-state leaders and rival campaign officials : The strength of his candidacy will be measured not by whether he can win Iowa , but by how much .\nBiden has vowed to make trips to Iowa frequently but his visits and investment in organization need to ramp up quickly : It \u2019 s the last state for which Biden announced his staffing \u2014 long after some rivals were nearly fully built out \u2014 and he has made just one trip to the state so far .\n\u201c I think the challenge ahead for him is that being a front-runner is a kiss of death , \u201d said Jerry Crawford , a longtime Iowa Democratic power broker , noting that Biden \u2019 s commanding lead means he \u2019 ll be a target of attacks for the next eight months .\nBernie Sanders , who consistently ranks a close second to Biden in state polls , came within three-tenths of a percentage point of beating Hillary Clinton in 2016 .

At the time of the Vermont senator \u2019 s February launch , 19,000 people signed onto the campaign in Iowa , either to volunteer , donate or caucus for the Vermont senator .

She has said her intention is to compete in all four early states , and she proved it by placing 200 paid staffers in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina .\nSen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , speaks to local residents during an organizing event , Sunday , Feb. 10 , 2019 , in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo\nIn the first two states to vote \u2014 Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 Warren has held more than 50 events so far , a reflection of the do-or-die nature of those states for her campaign . She doesn \u2019 t need to win Iowa outright , but her deep investment in the state means a poor finish would deal a severe blow to her campaign . And she \u2019 ll need some kind of a Iowa bounce to succeed in New Hampshire , where she likely will be need to finish among the top three to move on .\nCory Booker , another candidate who made early and deep investments in Iowa staffing , is widely considered to have one of the best on-the-ground organizations in the state . Iowa is not an essential state for him \u2014 his bigger bet is on South Carolina \u2014 but his campaign is aware that Barack Obama \u2019 s 2008 success in the South came only after Iowa delivered a stamp of approval .\nBooker is better positioned in Iowa than Kamala Harris , who figures to be one of his top rivals in South Carolina . Her team won \u2019 t reveal how many staffers it has in Iowa . But Harris has some familiarity with the state from campaigning there for Obama in 2008 , and her Iowa campaign chairwoman , Deidre DeJear , was Iowa \u2019 s first black nominee for statewide office from a major political party when she ran for state secretary of state last year .\nFor a top-tier candidate who performs poorly in Iowa , New Hampshire stands to provide a lifeline .

As a result , more candidates are flocking there \u2014 and with more frequency \u2014 than local Democrats ever recall .\nThe two candidates under the most pressure in New Hampshire are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by more than 20 percentage points in New Hampshire in 2016 , which makes it something of a must-win for him in 2020 . Warren , another neighboring senator who shares a media market with the state , also needs to finish in the top three to meet expectations .\nAt the moment , though , Joe Biden is running well ahead of both in the latest New Hampshire polls .\nBernie Sanders speaks in Concord , New Hampshire , in March . | Steven Senne/AP Photo\nState Democrats point to Sanders , Warren , Kamala Harris , Cory Booker and John Delaney as having the most robust staffs in the state . Warren has worked hard at having a presence there , holding 26 events since announcing her bid .\n\u201c There was this sort of \u2026 false narrative heading into the primary season about New Hampshire : Does it still matter ? Is it still relevant ? \u201d New Hampshire Young Democrats President Lucas Meyer said . \u201c And I think that has been pretty clearly wiped away by how the campaigns have built themselves up over the last two months in the investment of time and people . \u201d\nState Sen. Lou D \u2019 Allesandro said Biden \u201c has to do well \u201d in New Hampshire to maintain the luster of his front-runner status . So far , he said , Biden is off to a good start and Warren appears to be cutting into Sanders \u2019 advantage .\n\u201c Pete [ Buttigieg ] , Biden and Kamala [ Harris ] are the three generating excitement right now , \u201d said D \u2019 Allesandro , who \u2019 s long been an influential player in the state primary . \u201c Now , you \u2019 ve got to capitalize on that if you want to stay in the game . \u201d\nPete Buttigieg , in particular , could pose a problem for Sanders because of his appeal to young voters . The South Bend , Ind. , mayor has already won notice for his hire of Michael Ceraso , who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sanders in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 , to direct his effort there . For Buttigieg , there is some urgency to make a mark in either Iowa or New Hampshire \u2014 he already has 10 staffers in each state \u2014 because the demographic terrain in Nevada and South Carolina is not as well-suited for him .\nAt the moment , Nevada is considered the most open of the four early-nominating states . It \u2019 s viewed by most campaigns as an opportunity to either lock-in successes from earlier states or break out after a middling performance in Iowa or New Hampshire .\nThe state \u2019 s caucuses are sufficiently low-profile that no candidate is likely to see his or her candidacy made or broken there , except for one : former San Antonio mayor and ex-Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro . He is resting his candidacy almost entirely on performing well in Nevada , which boasts the largest Latino population \u2014 29 percent \u2014 of any of the early-voting states .\nWhile the state might not qualify as make-or-break for Kamala Harris , who represents neighboring California , it \u2019 s a high priority . A poor Nevada performance would be an alarming sign of weakness just 10 days before her home-state primary .\nThat \u2019 s why she \u2019 s visited Nevada four times as a presidential candidate \u2014 more trips than she has taken to either Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 and signed on Emmy Ruiz , who guided Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 victory in Nevada , as a senior adviser on her national staff .\nMost candidates have been slow to ramp up in Nevada , traditionally the early-nominating state that gets the least attention . With a highly transitory population and a relatively short history of caucusing , Nevada is difficult to canvass or poll . A large number of service employees in Las Vegas \u2014 many of them the union members influential in the state \u2019 s caucuses \u2014 work at night , and summer temperatures are unbearable for many campaign workers during the day .\nThere \u2019 s scant public polling available on the state of the race but it \u2019 s clear Joe Biden has cornered significant support as a result of long-standing Nevada ties . In a state where labor support is crucial , Biden was endorsed early in his campaign by state Sen. Yvanna Cancela , a former political director of the influential Culinary Workers Union .\nThe former vice president , who visited Nevada not long after announcing his campaign , assembled a state staff relatively quickly .\nBut he \u2019 s not the only candidate signaling intent to compete hard there . Among those who have hired state directors : Warren , Harris , Booker , Castro , Sanders and Rep. Seth Moulton .\nFour candidates have the most riding on South Carolina , home to the South \u2019 s first primary : Bernie Sanders , Cory Booker , Kamala Harris and Joe Biden .\nSanders doesn \u2019 t need to win there , but his campaign recognizes he can not get pummeled the way he did in 2016 . Back then , his presidential hopes were snuffed out after a 47-point loss to Hillary Clinton , a defeat that exposed his weakness among African American voters .\nLast month , Sanders sent the message that 2020 would be different , rolling out the endorsements of seven black state lawmakers . His campaign has built a list of more than 20,800 supporters in the state already .\n\u201c I think that Sen. Sanders appears to have learned from the campaign in 2016 .
