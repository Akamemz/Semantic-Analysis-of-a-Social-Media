    "content": "Senators introduced a long-awaited and sweeping immigration overhaul early Wednesday morning , touching off what is likely to be a charged debate over whether the legislation amounts to `` amnesty '' for those who broke the rules and does enough to help those who follow them .\nSen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , appeared on the Senate floor around 2 a.m. Wednesday to file the 844-page bill . It is the product of weeks of negotiations among the Senate 's `` Gang of Eight , '' a bipartisan group that includes Schumer and seven others .\n`` This bill marks the beginning of an important debate , '' Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , said . `` And I believe it will fix our broken system by securing our borders , improving interior enforcement , modernizing our legal immigration to help create jobs and protect American workers , and dealing with our undocumented population in a tough but humane way that is fair to those trying to come here the right way and linked to achieving several security triggers . ''\nRubio is arguably the most vital of the eight co-authors , as his support has the potential to attract fellow conservatives . He and others in the `` gang '' are making a hard-charging effort to ease conservative concerns , pointing out that the bill includes language to both boost border security while putting limits on the so-called path to citizenship .\nThe bill , as expected , includes a carefully calibrated trade-off where millions of illegal immigrants would be put on a pathway to legal status in exchange for paying fines , provided certain border security steps are taken .\nArguably the biggest hurdle to passage will be convincing conservatives that the flow of illegal immigration will be stemmed -- and not increased -- by the legislation .\nThe bill , as introduced , would require the Homeland Security Department to create and launch plans for border security and fencing before illegal immigrants can enter a provisional status . This could happen as early as six months after enactment of the bill .\nThey would remain in that provisional status for 10 years , able to work legally but barred from federal benefits like welfare or health care . After 10 years they could seek green cards conferring permanent legal status , provided certain goals for border apprehensions and other security measures are met .\nAfter another three years , those immigrants could petition for citizenship .\nIn total , the bill creates a minimum 13-year path to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants , costing them each $ 2,000 in fines plus additional taxes . Applicants would have to meet other criteria as well in order to qualify .\nIt 's unclear whether the border security `` triggers '' will be enough to satisfy skeptical lawmakers . Conservatives say border security improvements should be verified before illegal immigrants can seek citizenship . Illegal immigrant advocates say their pathway should not be held up by that process .\nRegardless , the plan dedicates billions to security efforts , including $ 3 billion to providing more border agents , customs agents and surveillance systems along the border ; and $ 1.5 billion to building up border fencing .\nIt also includes language meant to assuage concerns that the mass legalization would send millions onto the federal welfare rolls . The bill claims to strengthen a federal law requiring applicants for legal status to prove they wo n't become government dependents -- some Republicans have claimed this law is rarely enforced .\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , one of the authors in the bipartisan `` Gang of Eight , '' said after meeting with President Obama Tuesday afternoon that the security provisions in the bill would assure `` we wo n't have a third wave '' of illegal immigration .\n`` It 's not amnesty , '' he added , preemptively responding to criticism of the pathway to legal status .\nObama , after being briefed by McCain and Schumer , said the bill is `` largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform .
