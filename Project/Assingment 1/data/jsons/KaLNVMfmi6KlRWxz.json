    "content": "A decade ago , Democrats in Congress were deep into the process of designing and debating the health care law that would become Obamacare . Tea Party protests were about to spring up around the country in opposition to the law . And President Barack Obama was on the verge of delivering a major address defending the law from its critics , and hoping to rally support from his own party .\nIn that speech , Obama positioned his approach as a middle ground between two extremes . `` There are those on the left , '' he said , `` who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada 's , where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone . On the right , there are those who argue that we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own .

But in last night 's Democratic primary debate , which featured a full half-hour segment focused on health care\u2014which was introduced as `` the number-one issue for Democratic voters '' \u2014it was virtually absent . Instead , the evening 's leading contenders extensively defended Medicare for All , a single-payer plan that captured elements of both the extremes Obama said he wanted to avoid .\nMedicare for All , as proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I\u2013Vt . ) and vigorously supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D\u2013Mass . ) , would end the nation 's employer-based health care system and , in the space of four years , replace it with a fully government-run system that is closest to Canada 's , but even more restrictive , leaving virtually no room for private insurance . It would , according to both independent estimates and Sanders himself , raise government spending on health care by something like $ 30 or $ 40 trillion over the next decade . And it would require tax hikes or tax-like fees or premiums on the middle class . In terms of both cost and transition complexity , it would dwarf Obamacare .\nSanders and Warren spent much of the debate 's opening segment defending these ideas from tough questioning by the moderators and criticism from more moderate candidates who argued that the plan was too radical , too unpopular , and too unworkable .
