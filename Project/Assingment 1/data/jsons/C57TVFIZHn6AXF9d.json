    "content": "Donald Trump campaigned for the White House as a master dealmaker , the sort of tough and cold-eyed business executive who wouldn \u2019 t be afraid to make a big bet if he thought he had a decent shot at even bigger payoff .\nIt \u2019 s not just that Trump hasn \u2019 t been able to nail down deals on domestic issues like health care , trade issues like NAFTA , or foreign policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . It \u2019 s that he hasn \u2019 t really even tried , avoiding direct talks with political rivals or foreign leaders and instead preferring to simply sit on the sidelines and see what his aides could come up with .\nThe White House \u2019 s surprise announcement Thursday night that Trump would hold face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear program marks a startling break from that pattern \u2014 and the first time in his presidency that Trump has been willing to try negotiating the kind of long-shot deal that candidate Trump routinely said he could make .\nIt \u2019 s hard to overstate the magnitude of Trump \u2019 s gamble , or the risks . No American president has ever met with a North Korean leader , so Trump will be granting Kim a historic concession simply by showing up to the talks . The meeting is set to take place in just two months , leaving little time for the sorts of meticulous preparations that traditionally take place before such an important summit .\nKim might not negotiate in good faith or honor a deal even if one were struck . And Trump , who has a short attention span and a desperate desire for wins , might simply get outmaneuvered by a smarter and more disciplined adversary .\nPut it all together and you can get a sense of why many North Korea experts are reacting so cautiously to the White House announcement . Robert E. Kelly , a North Korea expert at South Korea \u2019 s Pusan National University , argued on Twitter that Trump was dangerously naive to think he could dive headlong into a decades-old conflict and singlehandedly solve it in a manner of months .\n\u201c We can always hope , \u201d Kelly wrote , \u201c but it is just as reasonable to fear that Trump , the reality TV star who somehow stumbled into the presidency for which he is woefully unfit , will wander from decades of joint US-South Korea policy , about which he naturally knows nothing , and make some kind of deal for a \u2018 win \u2019 that no other US official would endorse . \u201d\nThose are valid fears . Still , the prospect of face-to-face talks means there is at least a small chance of a deal , no matter how low the odds . And any direct US negotiations with North Korea are far better than the alternatives , which include the prospect of a cataclysmic war that would kill millions and leave both North and South Korea in ruins .\nTrump , meanwhile , will finally get the chance to show off the negotiating skills he \u2019 s bragged about for so long . As one senior administration official told CNN \u2019 s Jim Acosta , \u201c President Trump has made his reputation on making deals . \u201d\nNow he \u2019 ll have a shot at the biggest deal of all .\nThere \u2019 s still a lot we don \u2019 t know about the US-North Korea talks\nThe new diplomatic opening comes after a weeks-long charm offensive Kim started before last month \u2019 s Winter Olympics in South Korea .

Trump had spent months mocking Kim as \u201c Little Rocket Man , \u201d debating whether to launch a preemptive military strike against the North , and promising to \u201c totally destroy \u201d North Korea if Pyongyang threatened the US or its allies .\nTrump had also laid out a clear precondition for talks : North Korea had to promise to give up its nuclear weapons .\n\u201c Now we are talking , and they , by the way , called up a couple of days ago .
