For once , this most unorthodox of politicians struck a conventional presidential posture as he sought to stabilize his administration after a tumultuous five weeks in office .\nThough his language was more lofty and unifying than normal , Trump gave little quarter on the substance of his policies on issues ranging from trade , defense , immigration and counterterrorism . The result was a populist , nationalistic prescription that he said would yield `` a new chapter of American greatness . ''\n`` From now on , America will be empowered by our aspirations , not burdened by our fears , inspired by the future , not bound by failures of the past , and guided by a vision , not blinded by our doubts , '' Trump said , from the Speaker 's rostrum in the House of Representatives .\nDuring a vitriolic campaign and a raucous start to his term , Trump has done little to reach beyond his base of deeply committed voters who revile the kind of political elites that the President was staring down as he spoke on Tuesday .\nBut , beset by the lowest approval ratings of any new commander-in-chief of modern times , Trump made a palpable effort to court voters who did n't support him with an offer to lay down the battles of the past . In fact , his address ticked almost all the boxes of a traditional State of the Union style appearance .\n`` I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit . I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big , and bold , and daring things for our country , '' Trump said . `` I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment . Believe in yourselves . Believe in your future . And believe , once more , in America . ''\nIt was an uplifting and unifying message that many Americans have rarely heard from Trump , who argued `` the time for trivial fights is behind us . ''\nWhile Trump is not solely responsible for the coarsening of political life , his brash , Twitter-fueled approach has rocked the nation 's politics . The question now is whether the President was previewing a new , more sober political persona or whether he will return to his old habits .\nThe change in his tone was evident from the first moments of his speech when he condemned the recent spate of threats against Jewish community centers , vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas .\nHe said the violence was a reminder that `` while we may be a nation divided on policies , we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms . ''\nThe comment followed heavy criticism of Trump for not addressing such violence .\nThe new President entered the House chamber to thunderous applause and spoke of the `` renewal of the American spirit . ''\nA senior White House official said Trump wrote the speech himself with input from almost every member of his presidential team of advisers .\nIn the emotional high point of the speech , Trump turned to the first lady 's box and acknowledged Carryn Owens , the widow of a US Navy Special operator , William `` Ryan '' Owens , who was killed in an anti-terror raid in Yemen in the first major military engagement of the new administration .\n`` Ryan died as he lived : a warrior , and a hero -- battling against terrorism and securing our nation , '' Trump said as the House floor erupted in a prolonged standing ovation .

''\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN that Trump 's `` speeches and the realities are very , very far apart . ''\n`` Until his reality catches up with his speeches , he 's got big trouble , '' Schumer said .\nThough his rhetoric was soaring , Trump still struck hardline notes . He overruled national security adviser H.R . McMaster , according to a senior administration official , to warn of `` radical Islamic terrorism .

''\n`` We will soon begin the construction of a great , great wall along our southern border , '' Trump said , drawing Republican cheers even as he did n't mention his earlier promise that Mexico would pay for construction .\n`` As we speak tonight , we are removing gang members , drug dealers , and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens .

But he did not provide further clarity on that position during his address .\nSo far there is little sign that the new President 's legislative agenda , which includes repealing and replacing Obamacare , a big tax overhaul , and a $ 1 trillion infrastructure program , is anywhere near coming to fruition .\nThat explains why he devoted a considerable portion of the address to touting his achievements so far . He argued that his election alone had convinced big firms like Ford , Sprint , SoftBank and Intel to invest billions of job-creating dollars in the US .

A new system , he said , must retain coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions , should offer plans backed by tax credits and expanded health savings accounts and should preserve Medicaid expansion in the states . Trump also vowed to bring down the high price of drugs `` immediately .

''\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi , who was instrumental in passing the law , shook her head as Trump condemned it .\nThe President also signaled action on another key piece of his agenda -- tax reform , promising `` massive '' relief for the middle classes and cuts in corporate tax .

Given that he has also said he will protect entitlements , questions will be asked about how the administration can finance its ambitious plans .\nTrump 's speech was closely watched around the world , given that his pronouncements on foreign policy have caused alarm and confusion .
