( I saw only two men wearing overalls among a crowd of thousands . ) Don \u2019 t confuse a civilian semi-automatic rifle with an actual military gun . Don \u2019 t say : \u201c I support the second amendment , but ... \u201d That makes you what gun nuts call a \u201c butter \u201d .\nThe most common complaint I heard was that while the American media constantly covers gun violence and gun massacres , it rarely covers self-defensive gun use .\n\u201c You always hear it in the news if something goes wrong , but you don \u2019 t hear about all the things that go right , \u201d said John Correia , a NRA member who runs Active Self Protection , an Arizona-based self-defense training company .\nCan the US break its cycle of gun control failure ? Read more\nThe NRA members have a point . This week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 is exploring the terrible toll of gun violence in the US , and why the gun debate has become a vicious cycle of debate and inaction . Each year , more than 30,000 Americans are killed with guns . Add in people violently injured with guns , and the total is nearly 100,000 . Look at justice department survey data on broader gun use in crime , including incidents where offenders simply have or display a firearm , and the count of firearm crime is even higher : close to 500,000 total firearm victimizations a year .\nBut these numbers have to be put in context . The number of self-defensive gun uses each year is fiercely debated , and the estimates vary widely . But there are roughly 300 million guns in civilian hands . Set 30,000 gun deaths , or even 500,000 gun victimizations , against 300 million . As incomplete and imprecise as much gun data is , the bigger picture is clear : most guns are not being used in crimes . Most gun owners are not committing crimes .\nEven David Hemenway , a leading public health researcher who is skeptical of how many good things are done with guns , concedes this point .\n\u201c The large majority of gun owners aren \u2019 t going to do anything good or bad for public health with their guns this year , \u201d he said .\nIf you want to understand why gun rights advocates might not support new laws , or why the status quo might seem acceptable to some Americans , this is an essential bigger picture to grasp . There are millions of gun-owning Americans who use their guns safely , whose friends use their guns safely , whose children never access a gun when they are not supposed to .\nThe constant coverage of America \u2019 s most shocking acts of violence may make it seem like this gun-filled country is the wild west . That \u2019 s just not true .\nGun advocates also have a point when they argue that the general public does not have a very accurate sense of overall gun violence trends . A Pew survey after the Newtown shootings asked Americans if gun crime in the country had gone up or down over the last 20 years . The majority of Americans , 56 % , said they believed gun crime was higher than 20 years before .\nAmerica 's gun problem is so much bigger than mass shootings Read more\nThe reality was that America had become much safer over the previous 20 years . Even as the total number of guns in the civilian hands crept upwards , gun violence dropped sharply as the crack epidemic receded , for reasons that are still not fully understood . The country \u2019 s gun murder rate was down 49 % since its peak in 1993 .\nThe percentage of Americans who had an accurate understanding of this most basic gun violence trend : 12 % .\nIf you come to the NRA annual meeting expecting danger and risk and the thrill of the forbidden , you will be disappointed . In between the dire political speeches about the power elites and felons getting their voting rights back and how Hillary Clinton will destroy the second amendment , there are sessions on the history of the second world war and how to train your puppy .\nWhen I asked NRA members if they \u2019 ve ever had to use their gun to defend themselves , I heard no stories of dramatic shootouts or heroic interventions . Instead , each story was one of restraint : they felt threatened , they displayed a gun , and their potential attacker ran away .\nBut breaking the stalemate of the gun debate also requires acknowledging how wide a political gap there is between general public opinion in America and the small , fiercely committed membership of the NRA \u2013 and how different those world views can be .\nWhen Senate Republicans voted down a measure to require criminal background checks on all guns sales earlier this week , the votes sparked outrage and incomprehension . How could anyone oppose background checks ? In the documentary Under the Gun , news anchor Katie Couric had assembled a group of gun rights supporters to ask them that question .\n\u201c If there are no background checks for gun purchasers , how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun ? \u201d she said .\nThe question was followed by silence and footage of the gun rights supporters looking away . The moment seemed to back up the liberal orthodoxy on gun control : there are some gun laws that are such common sense that even fierce gun rights supporters have no reason to oppose them .\nAfter the film premiered , one of the gun rights advocates in the room leaked a separate audio recording of Couric \u2019 s interview . In fact , the gun rights advocates had had plenty of skeptical responses to Couric \u2019 s question about background checks . The film \u2019 s director had simply edited them out .
