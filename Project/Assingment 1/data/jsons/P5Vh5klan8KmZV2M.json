    "content": "President Trump invoked on Sunday past pro-border security comments by two unlikely political adversaries -- Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- as the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding enters its third week .\nIn a pair of early-morning posts on Twitter , Trump , who later headed to a meeting with advisers at Camp David to discuss border security , also seemingly addressed reports that the prolonged shutdown will end up costing the government more than the $ 5 billion he has requested for the wall , writing that in the end , a `` properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year ! ''\nTrump 's remarks underscored his apparent unwillingnesss to compromise on securing at least some of the border wall funding he has demanded , despite the insistence of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats will never pay for a wall . However , in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd that Trump `` was willing to agree , and he mentioned this at the Rose Garden press conference , to take a concrete wall off the table . ''\nMulvaney had met with senior congressional officials on Saturday to try to make progress on a compromise , although he suggested the encounter had been mostly unproductive .\nIN SITUATION ROOM MEETING , SCHUMER , PELOSI INTERRUPT DHS SECRETARY WITHIN 5 SECONDS\n`` Again , what 's driving this is the president 's desire to change the conditions at the border , '' Mulvaney said . `` And if he has to give up a concrete wall , replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say , 'See ? He 's not building a wall anymore ' that should help us move in the right direction . ''\nOn Twitter , the president intimated that cynical political considerations were motivating Democrats ' rejection of wall funding . Pelosi and other Democrats have suggested they would be willing to fund general border security efforts , but not a wall .

' \u201d Barrack Obama , 2005 , '' Trump wrote on Sunday , quoting the former president in 2005 . Then-Sen. Obama made the remarks at a press conference with then-Florida GOP Sen. Mel Martinez , as part of a bipartisan effort to address illegal immigration .\nObama 's full quote at the time : `` We simply can not allow people to pour into the United States , undetected , undocumented , unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently , diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country . ''\n`` We all agree on the need to better secure the border and to punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants , '' Obama added . `` We are a generous and welcoming people , here in the United States , but those who enter the country illegally , and those who employ them , disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law . ''\nObama went on to advocate for imposing a `` hefty fine '' on those already in the country illegally , as well as tighter border security measures .\nIn his post , Trump also provided a partial quote from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , emphasizing her support for the Secure Fence Act of 2006 . That legislation passed by an overwhelming 80-19 majority , and was backed by Obama , as well .\n`` I voted , when I was a Senator , to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in ... \u201d Hillary Clinton , 2015 , '' Trump wrote .\n`` We \u2019 re not doing a wall .

A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year ! ''\nLast week , former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly flatly asserted in an interview with The Los Angeles Times that the president 's proposed border project `` is not a wall '' and that all plans for a concrete wall were abandoned long ago -- directly contradicting the White House 's repeated claims .\nIn a series of Twitter posts last month , Trump insisted that `` we are not building a Concrete Wall , we are building artistically designed steel slats , so that you can easily see through it . '' But Kelly 's comments were seemingly at odds with the president 's multiple tweets calling for `` money to finish the Wall , '' as well as his promises during and after the 2016 presidential campaign .\n`` To be honest , it \u2019 s not a wall , \u201d Kelly said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times . \u201c The president still says \u2018 wall \u2019 \u2014 oftentimes frankly he \u2019 ll say \u2018 barrier \u2019 or \u2018 fencing , \u2019 now he \u2019 s tended toward steel slats .
