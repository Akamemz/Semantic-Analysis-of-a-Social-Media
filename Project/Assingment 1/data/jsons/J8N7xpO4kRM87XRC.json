    "content": "In a speech on changing the tax code , President Trump offered some political spin on the facts .\n\u2022 Trump claimed \u201c anywhere from $ 3 trillion to $ 5 trillion \u201d of profits are left overseas by U.S. companies to avoid U.S. taxes . But his own press office cites an estimate of $ 2.6 trillion in a fact sheet posted online the day of his speech . The group that published that number told us $ 5 trillion \u201c seems impossibly high . \u201d\n\u2022 The president compared apples to oranges in saying the U.S. just had a 3 % growth rate in gross domestic product \u2014 that \u2019 s for the quarter \u2014 while \u201c on a yearly basis \u201d under the Obama administration , growth \u201c never hit 3 % . \u201d Quarterly GDP growth exceeded 3 % eight times under President Obama .\n\u2022 Trump said the U.S. was \u201c dead last \u201d in terms of business taxes . The U.S. has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries , but the rate isn \u2019 t the highest by other measures , such as when tax credits are included .\n\u2022 Trump said that \u201c more than 90 % of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes \u201d because the \u201c tax code is so complicated. \u201d Fifty-four percent paid someone else ; another 40 % used tax software .\nTrump made his remarks on Aug. 30 in Springfield , Mo. , calling on Congress to \u201c support pro-American tax reform . \u201d\nTrump exaggerated the amount of money U.S. companies likely have in offshore accounts , nearly doubling a figure the White House includes in a fact sheet , released the same day as the president \u2019 s remarks .\nTrump : `` Because of our high tax rate and horrible , outdated , bureaucratic rules , large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home . So they leave the money over there . The amount of money we \u2019 re talking about is anywhere from $ 3 trillion to $ 5 trillion . Can you believe that ? ''\nU.S. companies with business overseas do keep some profits in offshore accounts , where it isn \u2019 t subject to U.S. corporate taxes until it is repatriated to this country . The profits are declared indefinitely , or permanently , reinvested , which means the companies say they will reinvest the money abroad .\nIf a U.S. company does bring the money back to the United States , it would be \u201c subject to the U.S. tax rate of 35 % minus a tax credit equal to whatever taxes the company paid to foreign governments , \u201d the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains in a March report on this issue .\nThe White House cites figures from that report in its Aug. 30 fact sheet on Trump \u2019 s tax remarks .\nWhite House fact sheet , Aug. 30 : `` Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $ 2.6 trillion in profits offshore to avoid $ 767 billion in Federal taxes , according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . ''\nIf the White House is citing a figure of $ 2.6 trillion for profits kept overseas , where does Trump get the $ 5 trillion figure ? We asked the White House , but we haven \u2019 t received a response .\nWe also asked ITEP , a nonprofit that partners with the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice , about the $ 5 trillion figure , which Trump has used before . ITEP Senior Fellow Matthew Gardner told us in an email : \u201c I have never seen an estimate as high as $ 3 trillion , and the $ 5 trillion number seems impossibly high . \u201d\nITEP \u2019 s estimate is for Fortune 500 companies , but the independent research firm Audit Analytics has a database for all companies that file with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Don Whalen , the firm \u2019 s director of research , told us that as of today , there were $ 2.8 trillion in corporate profits indefinitely reinvested .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign cited a $ 2.1 trillion estimate from 2015 in the footnotes for Trump \u2019 s economic speech in Detroit in August 2016 . In that speech , Trump said : \u201c We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. \u201d And his campaign tax plan used a figure of $ 2.5 trillion .\nBut he has established a pattern of bumping that up to $ 5 trillion . He told the Economic Club of New York in September 2016 : \u201c Some people say there are $ 2 trillion dollars overseas , I think it \u2019 s $ 5 trillion. \u201d And he used the figure in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late July .\nTrump went on to say in his Aug. 30 remarks : \u201c By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money , and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult , we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that the U.S. has tried to spur repatriation of these earnings before . In 2004 , the American Jobs Creation Act created a one-year reduction that made the tax rate on repatriated profits 5.25 % for companies that paid a 35 % corporate rate , explains a 2011 Congressional Research Service report . About one-third of offshore earnings were brought back to the U.S. , CRS said , but studies on the impact generally found that \u201c the repatriations did not increase domestic investment or employment . They further conclude that much of the repatriations were returned to shareholders through stock repurchases . \u201d\nThe president didn \u2019 t reveal details on what his tax holiday for offshore profits would be . His campaign tax plan , however , proposed a repatriation tax of 10 % .\nThough he gets the numbers right , Trump engaged in some misleading spin when he compared economic growth under his administration with the previous administration .\nTrump , Aug. 30 : `` And today , a very appropriate day that this should happen , we just announced that we hit 3 % in GDP . Just came out . And on a yearly basis , as you know , the last administration , during an eight-year period , never hit 3 % . So we \u2019 re really on our way . ''\nIt \u2019 s true that the real GDP growth rate was 3 % for the second quarter of this year , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . But Trump doesn \u2019 t make it clear that he is talking about one quarter , and then he compounds the distortion by comparing one quarter growth to annual growth under the Obama administration .\nIn fact , the real GDP growth rate exceeded 3 % in eight quarters during the Obama administration , with a high of 5.2 % in the third quarter of 2014 , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .\nTrump is correct that the annual real GDP growth rate never exceeded 3 % under Obama . The highest it reached was 2.9 % in 2015 , according to the BEA . It remains to be seen if the nation \u2019 s economy will top 2.9 % annual growth under Trump . Real GDP increased just 1.2 % in the first quarter of this year .\nTrump claimed \u201c when it comes to the business tax , we [ the U.S. ] are dead last. \u201d And , he said , the U.S. rate is \u201c 60 % higher \u201d than \u201c our economic competitors. \u201d The U.S. does have the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries . But the U.S. isn \u2019 t highest when tax credits are factored in , for example .\nThere are many ways to measure and compare corporate tax burdens , and Trump chose those that paint the U.S. in the worst possible light relative to other countries .\nTrump : `` Today , we are still taxing our businesses at 35 % , and it \u2019 s way more than that . And think of it , in some cases way above 40 % when you include state and local taxes in various states . The United States is now behind France , behind Germany , behind Canada , Ireland , Japan , Mexico , South Korea and many other nations . \u2026 `` So when it comes to the business tax , we are dead last . Can you believe this ? So this can not be allowed to continue any longer . America must lead the way , not follow from behind . We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors , to one that is more than 60 % higher . We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries . ''\nIt \u2019 s not strictly true that the U.S. has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than every other country in the world . That dubious distinction goes to Comoros , a tiny archipelago off Africa \u2019 s east coast that has a statutory rate of 50 % , and the United Arab Emirates , which selectively levies at a rate of 55 % , Kyle Pomerleau , director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation , told us .\nThe federal statutory corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 % , as Trump said , and that figure jumps to about 39 % when state taxes are added in . That is highest among the 35 advanced economies tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development . The next highest is France at 34.4 % .\nBut that \u2019 s just one way to measure corporate tax burdens . In 2014 , a Congressional Research Service report found that the average effective corporate tax rate in 2008 was 27.1 % , which tracks pretty closely to the GDP weighted average among other OECD countries , 27.7 % .\n\u201c Although the U.S. statutory tax rate is higher , the average effective rate is about the same , and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher , \u201d the CRS report states . \u201c The statutory rate differential is relevant for international profit shifting ; effective rates are more relevant for firms \u2019 investment levels . \u201d\nPomerleau , of the Tax Foundation , warned however that effective tax rate calculations that simply divide taxes paid by corporate profits skew results for the U.S. That \u2019 s because the U.S. has a smaller corporate sector than many other developed nations . And that \u2019 s because the U.S. has a larger proportion of pass-through businesses , such as S corporations and partnerships that are taxed at an individual rather than corporate rate . The marginal individual rate ranges from 10 % to 39.6 % .\nA Congressional Budget Office report in March presented three measures of corporate tax . The first , the \u201c top statutory corporate tax rate , \u201d lists the U.S. highest among G20 nations at 39.1 % . The second is the \u201c average corporate tax rate , \u201d a measure \u201c of the total amount of corporate taxes that a company pays as a share of its income. \u201d By that measure , the U.S. rate of 29 % ranks third among G20 countries , behind Argentina at 37.3 % and Indonesia at 36.4 % . Finally , the CBO calculated the \u201c effective marginal corporate tax rate , \u201d defined as \u201c a measure of a corporation \u2019 s tax burden on returns from a marginal investment. \u201d By that measure , CBO found , the U.S. rate of 18.6 % was fourth among G20 countries , lower than Argentina ( 22.6 ) , Japan ( 21.7 ) and the United Kingdom ( 18.7 ) .\nA 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that from 2006 to 2012 \u201c at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability. \u201d The GAO said : \u201c Among large corporations ( generally those with at least $ 10 million in assets ) less than half\u201442.3 percent\u2014paid no federal income tax in 2012 . Of those large corporations whose financial statements reported a profit , 19.5 percent paid no federal income tax that year . \u201d\nAs for Trump \u2019 s claim that \u201c we have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors , to one that is more than 60 % higher , \u201d that \u2019 s accurate when comparing the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the average statutory tax rate among the 35 countries tracked by the OECD . But according to a Congressional Research Service analysis of rates in 2010 , when weighted to reflect the relative size of the countries \u2019 economies , the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the OECD average is just 32 % .\nTrump discussed the complexity of the U.S. tax code that frustrates today \u2019 s taxpayers .\nTrump : `` In 1935 , the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instruction . Today , that basic form has 100 pages of instructions , and it \u2019 s pretty complex stuff . The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 % of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes . ''\nFifty-four percent of taxpayers \u2014 not all Americans \u2014 paid someone else to do their taxes for tax year 2014 , according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service , which serves as an advocate for taxpayers at the IRS . And another 40 % of taxpayers used tax software .\nThat would , of course , include some Americans who choose to use online software for ease and convenience , not necessarily because they think their taxes are too complicated . Some tax filers can use software for free , if they meet income and other requirements set by several companies .\nOf the 147.4 million individual returns filed in 2013 , 16 % were through 1040EZ , according to IRS data , which is one page .\nHe was right when he said that the 1040 instruction form in 1935 was only two pages . Today , the 1040 instruction booklet is 106 pages , although not all of them are instructions . There are dozens of pages of tables and other illustrations . His larger point , however , that filing taxes is much more complicated today is correct .\nBut Trump ignored one key difference between then and now : Only about 5 % of Americans paid the federal income tax in the 1930s . It wasn \u2019 t until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Revenue Act of 1942 that the federal income tax became a tax on the masses , according to the IRS .\nIRS , Taxes in U.S. History : `` In 1939 only about five percent of American workers paid income tax . The United States \u2019 entrance into World War II changed that figure . The demands of war production put almost every American back to work , but the expense of the war still exceeded tax-generated revenue . President Roosevelt \u2019 s proposed Revenue Act of 1942 introduced the broadest and most progressive tax in American history , the Victory Tax . ''\n\u201c By war \u2019 s end in 1945 , about 90 percent of American workers submitted income tax forms , and 60 percent paid taxes on their income , \u201d the IRS says .\nIn 1935 , the top marginal tax rate was 63 % ; today it is 39.6 % .\nMore : Trump pitches tax reform to Main Street , twists Democratic arms",
