    "content": "Today brought the sad news that , as has been feared and rumored for months , The Weekly Standard is closing . The death of that other conservative magazine is a tragedy , pure and simple . And it \u2019 s compounded by the chilling , spiteful , and pernicious manner of its execution . John Podhoretz , who was among the Standard \u2019 s founders , recounts the details here , and what I have heard comports with his report .\nThe news is tragic not so much for the loss of a venue for conservative political opinion writing , or the loss of an outlet for clear-eyed political journalism . The Standard was both of those things , and its demise would have been bad news even if they were all it did . But it is tragic news because the magazine did so much more .\nIt was , simply put , a writer \u2019 s magazine , defined by the distinct intelligences of the extraordinary people in its orbit . From its earliest days , in the mid-1990s , it was home to a strange and wonderful blend of gloriously middlebrow cultural criticism , unabashed idealism about America , seasoned realism about politics , and a sharp yet always somehow sympathetic disdain for the ridiculous humanity of the men and women who populate the upper echelons of our political , cultural , professional and other elite institutions .\nThis blend of attitudes was practically embodied in the permanent sly half-smile of its longtime editor in chief , Bill Kristol . The Standard always had something of Bill \u2019 s personality\u2014steeped in political philosophy and ready to quote the great romantic poets on a dime but deeply immersed in the minutia of the political moment , open to crazy ideas , always speaking precisely half in jest , and somehow friends with practically everyone .\nBut though it was broadly overarched by something of this personality , the Standard \u2019 s great strength was that it mixed the strong , distinct voices of its stable of in-house writers\u2014that it brought in great people and let them be great . From the elitist anti-elitism of David Brooks \u2019 s brilliant cultural writing in its early days through the sharp young-fogey heterodoxy of Matt Continetti \u2019 s political writing in its middle age to the extraordinary wealth of analytic , literary , and reporting talent of its last several years ( Mark Hemingway , John McCormack , Michael Warren , Alice Lloyd , and on and on ) , the Standard has been an incredible incubator of great writing .\nBut it has been all the more incredible for the voices that have defined it most throughout that span .
