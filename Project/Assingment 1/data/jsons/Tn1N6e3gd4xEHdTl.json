Bush once said .\nJust 42 % of Americans approved of Mr. Obama 's job performance as of September , according to Gallup , ranking him fifth out of the seven presidents since World War II who have served two terms .

Republican President Ronald Reagan 's relatively rosy 61 % approval rating in September 1986 was n't enough to prevent Democrats from picking up five House seats and eight Senate seats two months later .\nThe outlier here is President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , who was embroiled in an impeachment controversy in 1998 , halfway through his second term in office . His Gallup approval rating in September of that year was 63 % , as many Americans soured on the way Republicans handled the impeachment process . Democrats ended up picking up five House seats in the midterm , and there was no change in the Senate 's balance of power .\nThat sort of outcome this November is beyond Democratic leaders ' wildest dreams .\nIn 2014 , Republicans need to pick up six seats to win control of the Senate . A swing of that size has happened three times in the six previous second-term midterm elections since World War II . In other words , there is a precedent but it 's not a given .\nThese swings are n't always pinned to the White House 's popularity . Democrats picked up a whopping 16 Senate seats in 1958 during Republican President Dwight Eisenhower 's second term . That was despite his Gallup approval rating in September of that year being a healthy 57 % . Meanwhile , Republicans were only able to capture three Senate seats in the 1966 midterm elections , even though Democratic President Lyndon Johnson 's approval rating was 47 % .\nThis period in any president 's second term is normally called the `` six-year itch .
