We \u2019 re sleepwalking toward catastrophe .\n\u201c The cliff is totally visible in front of us , and yet we \u2019 re not ready , \u201d said Paul Krugman , a Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist . \u201c It \u2019 s probably already too late to avoid enormous hardship . \u201d\n\u201c We designed an economic response that was predicated on a public health response that did not materialize \u201d\nThe Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Stability Act , or CARES Act , signed into law by President Trump in March , was an unprecedented act of fiscal policy by the US government . It entailed measures that would have once seemed unthinkable , including an extra $ 600 in unemployment benefits , $ 1,200 stimulus checks to most Americans , and billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dylan Matthews recently laid out , the Covid-19 response was larger than the stimulus policies put in place in response to the Great Recession and , from a fiscal standpoint , bigger than the New Deal .\nIt made a difference .

But the country didn \u2019 t \u2014 a series of public policy and leadership failures at the federal , state , and local levels have allowed the virus to thrive .\n\u201c We designed an economic response that was predicated on a public health response that did not materialize , \u201d said Trevon Logan , an economist at Ohio State University and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research .\nStates such as Texas , Florida , Arizona , and California have begun to close down parts of their economies again as coronavirus cases rise , and other states have paused some reopening plans . And even where lawmakers are ignoring the problem , consumers , workers , and businesses can \u2019 t .\nAccording to data from Glassdoor , job openings are falling , and JPMorgan \u2019 s consumer spending tracker has flattened .

As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Li Zhou recently laid out , if the program is allowed to expire , some 33 million people who have been kept afloat by those benefits will take an enormous hit . Congress is still haggling about it , and the outcome remains uncertain .\n\u201c The loss in payments that we \u2019 re looking at here is going to be about twice as big as a share of GDP as the Obama stimulus was at its peak , \u201d Krugman said . \u201c We \u2019 re talking about a really big fiscal contraction about to hit an economy that is nowhere near recovered . \u201d\nThis would leave millions of workers staring down a dark tunnel . Many would be forced to go back to work in risky situations , putting not only their own health at risk but also their families \u2019 . And it \u2019 s not clear that there are enough jobs for them to return to .\n\u201c There \u2019 s going to be a disruption in a significant amount of income for many households , \u201d said Damon Jones , an economist at the University of Chicago . \u201c People are going to be unnecessarily suffering . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s going to be a disruption in a significant amount of income for many households . People are going to be unnecessarily suffering . \u201d\nThe issue stretches far beyond unemployment . Much of the money given out through the Paycheck Protection Program to keep workers paid has been spent , and many small businesses were locked out of those loans altogether . There is evidence people are already hurting . An estimated one in three people in the US missed their housing payments in June , and while we \u2019 ve seen a recovery in the aggregate unemployment rate , for Black workers , that progress hasn \u2019 t been shared .\n\u201c We already know that family food insecurity has increased dramatically with the pandemic and is racially disproportionate . Missed mortgages and rent payments , even with the CARES Act , are substantial , \u201d Logan said . \u201c If there \u2019 s no additional support , we will see a significant number of household balance sheets go to immediate insolvency . \u201d\nThe longer the pandemic goes on , the worse the economic fallout gets . Some companies that hoped to weather the storm for a few months are deciding they have no more time to spare . Both United Airlines and American Airlines have signaled they may lay off thousands of workers in the fall . And as compared to the restaurant and retail jobs temporarily lost at the outset of the pandemic , many of the job losses happening now are permanent .\n\u201c Those companies don \u2019 t have a real plan to bring you back , \u201d said Betsey Stevenson , an economist at the University of Michigan and former Obama administration official . \u201c It \u2019 s thoughtful , these layoffs . And I \u2019 m not trying to say they \u2019 re good , I \u2019 m saying they \u2019 re not a rushed decision . They are crunching the numbers , they \u2019 re looking forward , they \u2019 re doing their best to forecast for the next six months , and then they \u2019 re saying they can \u2019 t sustain this level of payroll . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just what Congress needs to do again but also what it hasn \u2019 t done yet . State and local governments are facing enormous shortfalls that still haven \u2019 t been addressed . There is still no broad plan on what to do about kids and schools , and child care is an economic problem . Even if it doesn \u2019 t affect everyone personally , all the moving parts create a broader drag on the economy that makes the recovery harder and longer . And all these crises are mounting on top of longstanding systems of racial and economic inequality in the country .\n\u201c There are things we can do now to stem the bleeding , but fundamentally , it \u2019 s exposed that our economy isn \u2019 t prepared for a shock of any kind , let alone the scale of economic crisis that we \u2019 re seeing now , \u201d Hanks said .\nThis is not the version of 2020 anyone wanted , including the White House and Congress .
