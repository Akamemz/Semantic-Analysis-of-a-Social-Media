''\n`` We condemn the ongoing attempts by blackmail to achieve concessions from Russia , '' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a state news agency . `` This would be a very dangerous step . ''\nKonstatin Kosachev , who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Federation Council , Russia 's upper house of parliament , wrote on Facebook that Trump 's decision meant `` mankind is facing full chaos in the nuclear weapons sphere .
