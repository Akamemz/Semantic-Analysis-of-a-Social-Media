But the e-mail received by the national organizations `` contains no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public , '' she said .\nAt least two countries , Slovakia and Hungary , reported receiving e-mails in English that warned about threats to their citizens and Olympic athletes . The Olympic committees for Italy and Germany also confirmed that they had received the e-mail .

Nagy said the Hungarian Olympic Committee had shared the letter with the organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the IOC .\nHungary 's counterterrorism agency was analyzing the e-mail , but Hungary does not intend to change its plans to attend the Games in Sochi , Nagy said .\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee also received the message and sent it `` to the appropriate authorities , '' committee chief Scott Blackmun said .\n`` The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority , '' he said in a written statement . `` As is always the case , we are working with the U.S. Department of State , the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe . ''\nThe warnings come as Russian authorities are clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in the region surrounding Sochi , a resort city on the Black Sea coast . Russia has been battling a low-level Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region for more than a decade , and militants have vowed to strike at the Olympics .\nAmong those hunted by Russian security forces are three women suspected of being `` black widows '' -- a group of women who have carried out high-profile suicide bombings after government forces killed their insurgent husbands .\nPolice have handed out fliers with the women 's names and pictures to hotels in Rostov-on-Don , a southwestern Russian town through which the Olympic Torch relay was due to pass Wednesday , and in the Sochi area .\nIn an interview set to air Wednesday on CNN 's `` Amanpour '' program , Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said `` there are always some threats '' to public events , `` not only this country , but also in others . ''\nBut Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly , he said .\n`` I am referring to the mobilization , buildup , of police forces , and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the Games , '' Medvedev said .\nOver the weekend , as Putin told reporters that his government has a `` perfect understanding '' of the threat and how to stop it , a video posted online warned that insurgents had `` a present '' for Olympic visitors .\nU.S. Rep. Michael McCaul , chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security , told CNN 's `` New Day '' show from Moscow that there were no guarantees when it comes to safety , but the security operation in Sochi `` is the most impressive and well-fortified that we 've ever seen in Olympic history . ''\nMcCaul , who has been in Sochi to assess the security situation , said cooperation between U.S. and Russian security teams was good , but there was room for greater intelligence sharing .\nThe Russians `` have been not quite as candid with us , '' he said . `` I think we could help them a great deal if they would open up information sharing more to us . ''\nFBI agents are now going to Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts on counterterrorism efforts , McCaul said .\nAmid the concerns , the top U.S. military officer discussed sharing high-tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his Russian counterpart Tuesday , a Pentagon spokesman told CNN .\nThe matter came up `` on an exploratory level '' in a meeting between Gen. Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov , said Col. Edward Thomas , a Dempsey spokesman .\nMcCaul said President Barack Obama had also spoken with Putin about the issue .\nA tight security cordon is in place around Sochi , the Texas congressman said , but it 's hard to be sure that no hidden threat exists .\n`` The problem is , how many of these 'black widows ' ... came into this area before the ring of steel came up ? '' he said . `` We also know that one of these black widows actually was able to penetrate the ring in the Sochi area . ''\nRussia has deployed huge numbers of security officials , McCaul said , `` but it only takes one suicide bomber to get in to cause a real problem . ''\nMcCaul said it was likely that insurgents would carry out more bombings on softer targets outside Sochi , like those that hit a train station and trolley bus in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last year . `` They know the eyes of the world are on these Olympics , and what better way to make a statement , '' he said .\nBesides U.S. security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service , Olympic teams themselves are also hiring private security teams , he said .\n`` My concern is the 10,000 to 15,000 Americans who will be at these Games and our Olympic team itself being protected from these potential suicide bombers , '' he said .\n`` It 's very eerie when you go into Sochi to see the mountains and to think about these black widows , as they call them , who 've had their spouses killed by the FSB ( intelligence agency ) , now retaliating through suicide bombing . ''\nHowever , the Olympic Village itself is `` very well fortified , '' McCaul said , and there 's an impressive show of force on the ground .\n`` We are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected Games , '' he said .\nThe radical extremists in the region are historically more interested in targeting Russia than the United States , he added .\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who 's involved in the planning for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , told `` New Day '' that it was `` too late '' to reconsider the decision to hold the Winter Olympics in Sochi .\n`` When you look back on it , it 's awfully close to one of the worst situations in the world in terms of terrorism , exportation of terrorism , '' he said . But , at the same time , `` it happens to be in a country that has tremendous security . ''\nGiuliani said he was familiar with the Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City , Utah , only months after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . Those Games were almost canceled , he said , and had `` an enormous amount of security . ''\nAs for Sochi , Russia has `` devoted more resources to security than frankly I 've ever seen , '' Giuliani said .\n`` In retrospect , could you have picked a place that 's safer ? I guess you could ... ( but ) the minute you hold the Olympics in a place , whether it 's Salt Lake City or it 's Rio de Janeiro or it 's London , you have actually brought all the world 's problems to you , '' he said .\n`` So yes , Sochi is dangerous because it 's close to the Caucasus .
