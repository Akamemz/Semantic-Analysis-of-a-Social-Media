( China Daily/via Reuters )\nIts bad behavior in the wake of COVID-19 will leave it in its weakest global position in memory . And the U.S. will emerge stronger .\nSometime in late November the Chinese Communist Party apparat was aware that the ingredients of some sort of an epidemic were brewing in Wuhan . Soon after , it was also clear to them that a new type of coronavirus was on the loose , a threat they might have taken more seriously given the similar Chinese origins of the prior toxic SARS coronavirus and the resources of a Level 4 virology lab nearby .\nYet the government initially hid all that knowledge from its own people in particular and in general from the world at large . Translated into American terms , that disingenuousness ensured that over 10,000 Chinese nationals and foreigners living in China flew every day on direct flights into the United States ( Washington and California especially ) from late November to the beginning of February , until the Trump travel ban of January 31 .\nAll this laxity was also known to the Communist apparat in Beijing , which must have been amused when Trump was roundly damned by his liberal critics as a xenophobe and racist for finally daring to stop the influx on January 31 \u2014 the first major leader to enact such a total ban .\nYet , no thanks to the Chinese , America , so far , has been comparatively lucky \u2014 despite the grave risks of damaging a multi-trillion-dollar economy with the strictest quarantining , isolation policies , and social distancing in its history . Half the country lives in the interior away from ports of entry on the coasts . Medical care , sanitation , hygiene , and meat markets operate on different premises than in China , the supposed fated global hegemon . Transparency in a consensual society together with a free-market economy is encouraging tens of millions of citizens to work in tandem and independently to figure out creative ways to ameliorate the epidemic , politically , medically , socially , and economically . The result is that as of mid-March , the U.S. , the world \u2019 s foremost immigration destination and among the most visited of nations , had suffered fewer virus fatalities than some European countries a fifth or sixth of its population size .\nNo doubt when mass testing begins , the figures of known cases will soar , and fatalities will rise . Yet while we know pretty well the number of Americans who have died from the virus , we have in truth little idea of how many now carry it or how many have recovered from it , without knowing what sickened them or even whether they were ostensibly sick at all . In other words , the rate of new cases identified by testing may exceed the rate of new deaths , apprising us of a more precise \u2014 and perhaps lower \u2014 degree of viral toxicity .\nWhereas annual flu toxicity is adjudicated by modeling case numbers , and by sophisticated and learned guesses at the number of likely infections , so far the death rate of the coronavirus is calibrated a bit differently \u2014 apparently predicated both on known deaths and known cases . When we make facile comparisons between the flu and coronaviruses , they may prove valid , but for now it \u2019 s still wise to remember that annual flu cases could be fewer than what is guessed at through modeling each year , and corona infections may be higher than the current known numbers of confirmed positives . The former reality might mean that the flu is at times a little more lethal than we think and the corona virus a little less deadly . That is not to suggest that most strains of flu are as lethal as the coronavirus , only that for the vast majority of Americans the current U.S. COVID-19 case-to-fatality ratio of 2 percent may eventually prove less , and influenza \u2019 s commonly cited 0.01 lethality rate may prove higher .
