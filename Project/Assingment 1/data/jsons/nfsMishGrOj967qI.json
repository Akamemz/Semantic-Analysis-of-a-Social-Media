    "content": "people were forced from their homes , deprived of their land or had their livelihoods damaged because they lived in the path of a World Bank project .\nHow The World Bank Broke Its Promise To Protect The Poor\nFind Out First ICIJ and The Huffington Post estimate that 3.4 million people have been physically or economically displaced by World Bank-backed projects since 2004 . For email updates on our investigation , sign up below .\nBeneath a gloomy white sky , more than 100 armed police poured into the slum of Badia East in the teeming megacity of Lagos , Nigeria .\nAs they advanced , they cracked their batons on the unpaved streets and against the ramshackle walls of the shanties .\n\u201c If you love your life , move out ! \u201d the officers shouted .\nThousands of people grabbed what belongings they could carry and fled .\nThen a line of hulking excavators moved in , using their hydraulic claws to smash homes into pieces . Within hours , the neighborhood was a ruin .\nBimbo Omowole Osobe , a former resident of the Badia East slum who was evicted in 2013 when her neighborhood was demolished , sits in the clinic where she now sleeps at night in the reception area . Osobe joined with volunteers from Justice and Empowerment Initiatives , an NGO where she works with other slum dwellers to fight demolitions . A child in the slums of Orisunbare Ijora Badia in Lagos , Nigeria . George Osodi / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\nBimbo Omowole Osobe briefly lost track of her children in the chaos . When she returned to the community hours later , her concrete-block home and two small shops were gone .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like when a woman goes in for labor , and the baby comes out dead , \u201d she said . \u201c That \u2019 s how it felt to me . \u201d\nThe Lagos state government flattened Badia East in February 2013 to clear land in an urban renewal zone financed by the World Bank , the global lender committed to fighting poverty . The neighborhood \u2019 s poor residents were cast out without warning or compensation and left to fend for themselves in a crowded , dangerous city .\nEvictions like the one in Badia East aren \u2019 t supposed to happen in the middle of projects backed by the World Bank .\nFor more than three decades , the lender has maintained a set of \u201c safeguard \u201d policies that it claims have brought about a more humane and democratic system of economic development . Governments that borrow money from the bank can \u2019 t force people from their homes without warning . Families evicted to make way for dams , power plants or other big projects must be resettled and their livelihoods restored .\nKey Findings Over the last decade , projects funded by the World Bank have physically or economically displaced an estimated 3.4 million people , forcing them from their homes , taking their land or damaging their livelihoods .\nThe World Bank has regularly failed to live up to its own policies for protecting people harmed by projects it finances .\nThe World Bank and its private-sector lending arm , the International Finance Corp. , have financed governments and companies accused of human rights violations such as rape , murder and torture . In some cases the lenders have continued to bankroll these borrowers after evidence of abuses emerged .\nEthiopian authorities diverted millions of dollars from a World Bank-supported project to fund a violent campaign of mass evictions , according to former officials who carried out the forced resettlement program .\nFrom 2009 to 2013 , World Bank Group lenders pumped $ 50 billion into projects graded the highest risk for \u201c irreversible or unprecedented \u201d social or environmental impacts \u2014 more than twice as much as the previous five-year span .\nThe bank \u2019 s commitment , it says , is to \u201c do no harm \u201d to people or the environment .\nOver the past decade , the bank has regularly failed to enforce its rules , with devastating consequences for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet , an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists , The Huffington Post and other media partners has found .\nThe World Bank often neglects to properly review projects ahead of time to make sure communities are protected , and frequently has no idea what happens to people after they are removed . In many cases , it has continued to do business with governments that have abused their citizens , sending a signal that borrowers have little to fear if they violate the bank \u2019 s rules , according to current and former bank employees .\n\u201c There was often no intent on the part of the governments to comply \u2014 and there was often no intent on the part of the bank \u2019 s management to enforce , \u201d said Navin Rai , a former World Bank official who oversaw the bank \u2019 s protections for indigenous peoples from 2000 to 2012 . \u201c That was how the game was played . \u201d\nIn March , after ICIJ and \u2588\u2588\u2588 informed World Bank officials that the news outlets had found \u201c systemic gaps \u201d in the institution \u2019 s protections for displaced families , the bank acknowledged that its oversight has been poor , and promised reforms .\n\u201c We took a hard look at ourselves on resettlement and what we found caused me deep concern , \u201d Jim Yong Kim , the World Bank \u2019 s president , said in a statement .\nThe scope of \u201c involuntary resettlement , \u201d as the bank calls it , is vast . From 2004 to 2013 , the bank \u2019 s projects physically or economically displaced an estimated 3.4 million people , forcing them from their homes , taking their land or damaging their livelihoods , ICIJ \u2019 s analysis of World Bank records reveals .\nThe true figure is likely higher , because the bank often fails to count or undercounts the number of people affected by its projects .\nA team of more than 50 journalists from 21 countries spent nearly a year documenting the bank \u2019 s failure to protect people moved aside in the name of progress . The reporting partners analyzed thousands of World Bank records , interviewed hundreds of people and reported on the ground in Albania , Brazil , Ethiopia , Honduras , Ghana , Guatemala , India , Kenya , Kosovo , Nigeria , Peru , Serbia , South Sudan and Uganda .\nIn these countries and others , the investigation found , the bank \u2019 s lapses have hurt urban slum dwellers , hardscrabble farmers , impoverished fisherfolk , forest dwellers and indigenous groups \u2014 leaving them to fight for their homes , their land and their ways of life , sometimes in the face of intimidation and violence .\nAsia And Africa Resettled Nearly all of the estimated 3.4 million people who have been physically or economically displaced by World Bank-backed projects between 2004 and 2013 live in Africa or one of three Asian countries : Vietnam , China and India .

Continent Evicted People Displaced See Countries By : People Displaced Total Projects Source : the World Bank Only countries where resettlement is known to have occurred are included .\nBetween 2004 and 2013 , the World Bank and its private-sector lending arm , the International Finance Corp. , committed to lend $ 455 billion to bankroll nearly 7,200 projects in developing countries .\nOver the same span , people affected by World Bank and IFC investments lodged dozens of complaints with the lenders \u2019 internal review panels , alleging the lenders and their borrowers failed to live up to World Bank and IFC safeguard rules .\nIn Lagos , the World Bank \u2019 s ombudsman , the Inspection Panel , said bank management \u201c fell short of protecting the poor and vulnerable communities against forceful evictions. \u201d Bank officials should have paid better attention to what was going on in Badia East , the panel said , given Lagos authorities \u2019 long history of bulldozing slums and forcing people from their homes .\nOne year after the evictions , the bank loaned Lagos authorities $ 200 million to support the state government \u2019 s budget .\nThe World Bank said it was \u201c not a party to the demolition \u201d and that it advised the Lagos government to negotiate with displaced people , leading to compensation for most of those who said they \u2019 d been harmed .\nCases involving evictions have drawn the most attention , but the most common hardships suffered by people living in the path of World Bank projects involve lost or diminished income .\nA fisherman near Mundra , India , prepares the net for an overnight fishing trip . Locals say a World Bank Group-backed project in the area has depleted fish stocks . Sami Siva / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\nOn India \u2019 s northwest coast , members of a historically oppressed Muslim community claim that heated water spewing from a coal-fueled power plant has depleted fish and lobster stocks in the once-fertile gulf where they make their living . The IFC loaned Tata Power , one of India \u2019 s largest companies , $ 450 million to help build the plant .\nThe U.S. and other global powers launched the World Bank at the end of World War II to promote development in countries torn by war and poverty . Member countries finance the bank and vote on whether to approve roughly $ 65 billion in annual loans , grants and other investments .\nIn 2014 , the bank financed initiatives as varied as training for chicken farmers in Senegal and sewage system upgrades in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .\nWhat Is The World Bank ? The World Bank Group is the globe \u2019 s most prestigious development lender , bankrolling hundreds of government projects each year in pursuit of its high-minded mission : to combat the scourge of poverty by backing new transit systems , power plants , dams and other projects it believes will help boost the fortunes of poor people .

The bank is now in the middle of a rewrite of its safeguards policy that will set its course for decades to come .\nSome current and former World Bank officials warn that the proposed revisions will further undermine the bank \u2019 s commitment to protecting the people it was created to serve . The latest draft of the new policy , released in July 2014 , would give governments more room to sidestep the bank \u2019 s standards and make decisions about whether local populations need protecting , they say .\n\u201c I am saddened to see now that pioneering policy achievements of the bank are being dismantled and downgraded , \u201d said Michael Cernea , a former high-ranking bank official who oversaw the bank resettlement protections for nearly two decades . \u201c The poorest and most powerless will pay the price . \u201d\nThe bank says it has listened to the feedback and will release a revised draft with \u201c the strongest , most state-of-the-art environmental and social safeguards . \u201d\nA man-made disaster in eastern Brazil in the late 1970s helped prompt the World Bank to adopt its first systematic protections for people living in the footprint of big projects .\nRising waters upstream from the Sobradinho Dam , built with World Bank financing , forced more than 60,000 people from their homes . Their relocation was poorly planned and chaotic . Some families fled their villages as water began pouring into their homes and fields , leaving behind herds of animals to drown .\nThe fiasco gave Cernea , the World Bank \u2019 s first in-house sociologist , leverage to convince the bank to approve its first comprehensive policy for protecting people whose lives are upended by the bank \u2019 s projects . Cernea based the new rules , approved by the bank in 1980 , on a simple premise : People who lose their land , their homes or their jobs should get enough help to restore , or exceed , their old standard of living .\nUnder the World Bank \u2019 s rules , governments seeking money from the bank must put together detailed resettlement plans for people who are physically or economically displaced .\nCurrent and former bank employees say the work of enforcing these standards has often been undercut by internal pressures to win approval for big , splashy projects . Many bank managers , insiders say , define success by the number of deals they fund . They often push back against requirements that add complications and costs .\nDaniel Gross , an anthropologist who worked for the bank for two decades as a consultant and staff member , said in-house safeguards watchdogs have \u201c a place at the table \u201d in debates over how much the bank is required to do to protect people . But amid the push to get projects done , they \u2019 re frequently ignored and pressed to \u201c play ball and get along , \u201d he said .\nIn an internal survey conducted last year by bank auditors , 77 percent of employees responsible for enforcing the institution \u2019 s safeguards said they think that management \u201c does not value \u201d their work . The bank released the survey in March , at the same time that it admitted to poor oversight of its resettlement policy .\n\u201c Safeguards are irrelevant for managers , \u201d said one staffer who was surveyed for the report .\nAlbanian authorities used a World Bank-backed project to clear the way for a planned seaside resort , partly or completely tearing down 15 homes in the impoverished village of Jale . Andon Koka 's home was flattened , and half of his brother 's home ( in background ) was demolished . Besar Likmeta / BalkanInsight.com\nIn 2007 , residents of Jale , a tiny Albanian beach hamlet on the Ionian Sea , found themselves in the path of a coastal cleanup effort backed by a $ 17.5 million loan from the World Bank . More than a dozen poor families lived in Jale , many in homes with add-ons and extra floors they rented to vacationers .\nThey saw Jale as an ideal spot for a high-end resort to lure tourists to the country . They decided to use the coastal restoration project \u2014 which was managed by the son-in-law of Sali Berisha , Albania \u2019 s prime minister at the time \u2014 as a vehicle for turning the plan into a reality .\nBefore dawn one April morning , dozens of police officers streamed into the beach community , heading for structures previously identified in photos taken during aerial surveys paid for by the World Bank . The police rousted residents from their beds and forced them from their homes . Demolition crews leveled entire houses or tore down additions that the government said had been put up without proper permits .\nSanie Halilaj cried as work crews pulled down half of the house she had shared with her husband for more than half a century .\n\u201c When you lose a loved one , someone consoles you , \u201d the 74-year-old said in a recent interview . \u201c But when you lose your home , there is no consolation . \u201d\nBank officials initially denied the evictions were connected to the bank-financed coastal initiative . But a year later , the bank \u2019 s Inspection Panel found \u201c direct links \u201d between the project and the demolitions . The panel slammed the bank for embarking on a \u201c systematic effort \u201d to obstruct its investigation , providing answers \u201c at times in total conflict with factual information which had been long known to management . \u201d\nAfter the panel \u2019 s report was released in 2008 , then-World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick called the bank \u2019 s actions \u201c appalling. \u201d Zoellick vowed that the institution would swiftly \u201c strengthen oversight , improve procedures and help the families who had their buildings demolished . \u201d\nSeven years later , little has changed . In Jale , most residents still haven \u2019 t received payment from the government for what they lost , even though the World Bank has covered their legal costs . At the bank , oversight remains weak .\nA 2014 internal World Bank review found that in 60 percent of sampled cases , bank staffers failed to document what happened to people after they were forced from their land or homes .\nSeventy percent of the cases sampled in the 2014 report lacked required information about whether anyone had complained and whether complaints were resolved , indicating the bank \u2019 s mechanisms for dealing with grievances were \u201c box-checking \u201d exercises that \u201c existed on paper but not in practice , \u201d the in-house reviewers wrote .\nThese \u201c sizeable gaps in information \u201d indicate \u201c significant potential failures in the bank \u2019 s system for dealing with resettlement , \u201d the report said . \u201c The inability to confirm that resettlement has been satisfactorily completed poses a reputational risk for the World Bank . \u201d\nBen Hallman / The Huffington Post Victor Mendoza , the president of a farming co-op near the sprawling Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru , with his 10-year-old son . The mine , built two decades ago with the financial backing of the International Finance Corp. , the private-lending arm of the World Bank , is deeply unpopular in this region . Farmers like Mendoza claim it is polluting their water supply and threatening the health of their families and livestock . Read the story here\nMost World Bank investments do not require evictions or damage people \u2019 s ability to earn a living or feed their families . But the percentage of those that do has increased sharply in recent years .\nA 2012 internal audit found that projects in the bank \u2019 s pipeline triggered the bank \u2019 s resettlement policy 40 percent of the time \u2014 twice as often as projects the bank had already completed .\nThe World Bank and IFC have also been boosting support for mega-projects , such as oil pipelines and dams , that the lenders acknowledge are most likely to cause \u201c irreversible \u201d social or environmental harm , an analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and ICIJ found .\nA big project can upend the lives of tens of thousands of people .\nSince 2004 , World Bank estimates indicate that at least a dozen bank-supported projects physically or economically displaced more than 50,000 people each .\nStudies show that forced relocations can rip apart kinship networks and increase risks of illness and disease . Resettled populations are more likely to suffer unemployment and hunger , and mortality rates are higher .\nThe World Bank acknowledges that resettlement is difficult , but says it \u2019 s often impossible to build roads , power plants and other much-needed projects without moving people from their homes .\n\u201c We stand by the need to continue financing infrastructure projects , including those that entail land acquisition and involuntary resettlement , \u201d said Theis , the World Bank spokesman .\nThe bank says it strives to make sure its borrowers provide real help to people pushed aside by big projects . In Laos , the bank says , authorities built more than 1,300 new homes with electricity and toilets , 32 schools and two health centers for thousands of people forced to move to make way for a World Bank-financed dam .\n\u201c Through careful project design and proper implementation , land acquisition and involuntary resettlement have resulted in people \u2019 s lives improving significantly , \u201d Theis said in a statement .\nIn a drought-haunted region of Brazil , farm families pushed aside by another World Bank-backed dam say that their lives haven \u2019 t been improved .\nThirty-five families live in a tiny , government-built relocation village called Gameleira , named after the dam and reservoir that forced them to leave their homes along the Munda\u00fa River .\nIn their old homes , they could take water from wells and the river itself , but the relocation village has no fresh water source . A World Bank report acknowledged a delay in getting water access for the new village , but said the village \u2019 s water issues had been solved by late 2012 .\nThe villagers say that \u2019 s not true . They are still waiting , four years after they were forced to relocate , for local authorities to keep their promise to build a small pipeline to draw water from the new reservoir to the relocation village . Meanwhile , water from the reservoir is being piped to urban areas .\nA well in the village produces salty water and , even with desalination equipment , each family is limited to 36 liters of water a day . Families supplement their supply by buying from commercial vendors , sometimes spending as much as a third of their modest incomes .\nThese purchases provide them enough water to irrigate small gardens of yuca , beans and corn . If they want to plant cash crops \u2014 such as cashews \u2014 they have to wait for rain , which hardly ever comes .\n\u201c We feel that we are suffering so that people from the city can have water , \u201d 39-year-old Francisco Ven\u00edlson dos Santos , a farmer and father of four boys and two girls , said . \u201c They abandoned us here . \u201d\nIn a written statement , the World Bank said it is satisfied the village was provided an adequate supply of water \u201c both in terms of quantity and quality. \u201d The bank said it is helping Brazilian authorities deal with northeast Brazil \u2019 s prolonged drought by helping \u201c to increase the resilience of small rural communities , \u201d giving them advice on drilling emergency groundwater wells and creating \u201c drought preparedness plans . \u201d\nIn July 2012 , an unconventional leader took over as the World Bank \u2019 s new president . Jim Yong Kim , a Korean-American physician known for his work fighting AIDS in Africa , became the first World Bank president whose background wasn \u2019 t in finance or politics .\nTwo decades before , Kim had joined protests in Washington , D.C. , calling for the World Bank to be shut down altogether for valuing indicators like economic growth over assistance to poor people .\nHuman rights advocates and bank staffers working on safeguards hoped that Kim \u2019 s appointment would signal a shift toward greater protections for people affected by World Bank projects .\nIn March , Kim said he was concerned about \u201c major problems \u201d in the bank \u2019 s oversight of its resettlement policies . He announced an action plan calling for greater independence for the bank \u2019 s safeguards watchdogs and a 15 percent funding boost for safeguards enforcement .\nBut while Kim and other bank officials have acknowledged general shortcomings , they have consistently denied that the bank shares blame for violent or wrongful evictions carried out by its borrowers .\nIn Ethiopia , the World Bank \u2019 s Inspection Panel found the bank had violated its own rules by failing to acknowledge an \u201c operational link \u201d between a bank-funded health and education initiative and a mass relocation campaign carried out by the Ethiopian government . In 2011 , soldiers carrying out the evictions targeted some villagers for beatings and rapes , killing at least seven , according to a report by Human Rights Watch and ICIJ \u2019 s interviews with people who were evicted .\nAndreea Campeanu / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Daily life in a refugee camp in South Sudan . Some of the camp \u2019 s residents fled Ethiopia to avoid brutal evictions carried out by government forces . New evidence suggests the government \u2019 s actions were funded by the World Bank . Read the story here\nKim said that while \u201c we could have done more \u201d to help the evicted communities , the bank was ultimately not at fault .\nIn India , the IFC \u2019 s internal ombudsman found that the lender had breached its policies by not doing enough to protect the large fishing community living in the shadow of the coal power plant it financed on the Gulf of Kutch . With Kim \u2019 s approval , IFC \u2019 s management rejected many of the ombudsman \u2019 s findings and defended the actions of its corporate client .\nIn both Ethiopia and India , the World Bank Group declined to direct its clients to fully compensate the affected communities .\nIn response to complaints about the Badia East evictions in Nigeria , the World Bank embraced a shortcut that fell short of its promise that people affected by projects will be fully compensated for their losses .\nTypically , a community that claims it has been harmed by a bank project can file a complaint that will trigger an investigation by the bank \u2019 s Inspection Panel .\nBut when three Badia East residents submitted a complaint , panel staffers held off launching an investigation . Instead , they guided the residents into a new pilot program for handling disputes . The program put the community into direct negotiations with the Lagos state government .\nMegan Chapman , then a lawyer for the Social and Economic Rights Action Center and now a co-founder of Justice & Empowerment Initiatives , represented the evicted residents . The Inspection Panel promised Chapman that the Badia East community could demand an investigation at any time if it wasn \u2019 t satisfied with the outcome , according to emails reviewed by ICIJ .\nNegotiations didn \u2019 t go well for the evicted residents . The Lagos government insisted they had been illegal squatters , even though some of them had lived there for decades . It gave the group an ultimatum : Accept a small payment and sign away any legal rights , or get nothing .\nChapman believed that the government \u2019 s offer violated the bank \u2019 s resettlement policy because it didn \u2019 t provide new homes for the displaced or compensation equal to what they \u2019 d lost . The payments that Lagos authorities offered for larger demolished structures , for example , were 31 percent lower than what the World Bank \u2019 s own consultants said they were worth .\n\u201c It was like David and Goliath . There were these little people fighting against this giant , \u201d Chapman said . The bank \u201c really left vulnerable people on their own . \u201d\nThe government \u2019 s ultimatum divided the community . The leader of Chapman \u2019 s organization said it was the best offer the evicted people were going to get . He said he was satisfied with the deal . Many residents and their advocates \u2014 including Chapman \u2014 objected .\nInternal emails obtained by ICIJ indicate that by early 2014 , the Inspection Panel \u2019 s chair , Eimi Watanabe , was already pushing to make sure that the panel would not investigate the World Bank \u2019 s role in the case .\nAfter hearing that the leader of Chapman \u2019 s group was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations , Watanabe urged her staff to issue a formal notice shutting down the possibility of any investigation before the fragile agreement fell apart , according to internal emails obtained by ICIJ .\n\u201c Pl [ ease ] issue notice soonest before it unravels , \u201d Watanabe wrote on Feb. 6 , 2014 .\nWatanabe \u2019 s directive didn \u2019 t immediately kill the investigation , but over the following months the panel made it clear that it didn \u2019 t want to dig deeper into the World Bank \u2019 s actions .\nIn July 2014 , two of the three residents who had filed the complaint told the panel they were unhappy with the deal and that they wanted to go forward with an investigation . The panel rejected their request and shut the case down with an official notice that said , as an aside , that the bank had fallen short of its own resettlement standards .\nChapman and other advocates say the bank misled them about how the pilot program would work and abandoned the people of Badia East .\nWatanabe did not respond to ICIJ \u2019 s questions about the Lagos case .\nGonzalo Castro de la Mata , the Inspection Panel \u2019 s current chair , said the panel \u201c deliberated carefully at every stage of the case \u201d and did not seek to arbitrarily shut down the investigation before it could start .\nHe said that although the Lagos government had agreed to follow World Bank rules for resettlement in Badia East and other neighborhoods , the evictions weren \u2019 t done under the official umbrella of the bank \u2019 s urban renewal initiative . Because of this and other factors , he said , the panel determined that \u201c a lengthy process of investigation would not at the end of day necessarily yield better outcomes \u201d for residents who lost their homes .\nTony Karumba / GroundTruth Joseph Kilimo Chebet , a father of five , standing next to the burned remains of his homestead in Kenya , destroyed only hours prior by Kenya Forest Service officers . Read the story here\nAs it enters its eighth decade , the World Bank faces an identity crisis .\nIt is no longer the only lender willing to venture into struggling nations and finance huge projects . It is being challenged by new competition from other development banks that don \u2019 t have the same social standards \u2014 and are rapidly drawing support from the World Bank \u2019 s traditional backers .\nChina has launched a new development bank and persuaded Britain , Germany and other American allies to join , despite open U.S. opposition .\nThese geopolitical shifts have fueled doubts about whether the World Bank still has the clout \u2014 or the desire \u2014 to impose strong protections for people living in the way of development .\nUnited Nations human rights officials have written World Bank President Kim to say they \u2019 re concerned that the growing ability of borrowers to access other financing has spurred the bank to join a \u201c race to the bottom \u201d and push its standards for protecting people even lower .\nThe bank \u2019 s proposed changes to its safeguard rules would grant many borrowers greater authority to police themselves . In the current draft , governments would be allowed to hold off on preparing resettlement plans until after the bank greenlights projects .

For email updates on our investigation, sign up below.\n\nBeneath a gloomy white sky, more than 100 armed police poured into the slum of Badia East in the teeming megacity of Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAs they advanced, they cracked their batons on the unpaved streets and against the ramshackle walls of the shanties.\n\n\u201cIf you love your life, move out!\u201d the officers shouted.\n\nThousands of people grabbed what belongings they could carry and fled.\n\nThen a line of hulking excavators moved in, using their hydraulic claws to smash homes into pieces. Within hours, the neighborhood was a ruin.\n\nBimbo Omowole Osobe, a former resident of the Badia East slum who was evicted in 2013 when her neighborhood was demolished, sits in the clinic where she now sleeps at night in the reception area. Osobe joined with volunteers from Justice and Empowerment Initiatives, an NGO where she works with other slum dwellers to fight demolitions.

George Osodi / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\n\nBimbo Omowole Osobe briefly lost track of her children in the chaos. When she returned to the community hours later, her concrete-block home and two small shops were gone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a woman goes in for labor, and the baby comes out dead,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it felt to me.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos state government flattened Badia East in February 2013 to clear land in an urban renewal zone financed by the World Bank, the global lender committed to fighting poverty. The neighborhood\u2019s poor residents were cast out without warning or compensation and left to fend for themselves in a crowded, dangerous city.\n\nEvictions like the one in Badia East aren\u2019t supposed to happen in the middle of projects backed by the World Bank.\n\nFor more than three decades, the lender has maintained a set of \u201csafeguard\u201d policies that it claims have brought about a more humane and democratic system of economic development. Governments that borrow money from the bank can\u2019t force people from their homes without warning. Families evicted to make way for dams, power plants or other big projects must be resettled and their livelihoods restored.\n\nKey Findings Over the last decade, projects funded by the World Bank have physically or economically displaced an estimated 3.4 million people, forcing them from their homes, taking their land or damaging their livelihoods.\n\nThe World Bank has regularly failed to live up to its own policies for protecting people harmed by projects it finances.\n\nThe World Bank and its private-sector lending arm, the International Finance Corp., have financed governments and companies accused of human rights violations such as rape, murder and torture. In some cases the lenders have continued to bankroll these borrowers after evidence of abuses emerged.\n\nEthiopian authorities diverted millions of dollars from a World Bank-supported project to fund a violent campaign of mass evictions, according to former officials who carried out the forced resettlement program.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, World Bank Group lenders pumped $50 billion into projects graded the highest risk for \u201cirreversible or unprecedented\u201d social or environmental impacts \u2014 more than twice as much as the previous five-year span.\n\nThe bank\u2019s commitment, it says, is to \u201cdo no harm\u201d to people or the environment.\n\nThe World Bank has broken its promise.\n\nOver the past decade, the bank has regularly failed to enforce its rules, with devastating consequences for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, The Huffington Post and other media partners has found.\n\nThe World Bank often neglects to properly review projects ahead of time to make sure communities are protected, and frequently has no idea what happens to people after they are removed. In many cases, it has continued to do business with governments that have abused their citizens, sending a signal that borrowers have little to fear if they violate the bank\u2019s rules, according to current and former bank employees.\n\n\u201cThere was often no intent on the part of the governments to comply \u2014 and there was often no intent on the part of the bank\u2019s management to enforce,\u201d said Navin Rai, a former World Bank official who oversaw the bank\u2019s protections for indigenous peoples from 2000 to 2012. \u201cThat was how the game was played.\u201d\n\nIn March, after ICIJ and HuffPost informed World Bank officials that the news outlets had found \u201csystemic gaps\u201d in the institution\u2019s protections for displaced families, the bank acknowledged that its oversight has been poor, and promised reforms.\n\n\u201cWe took a hard look at ourselves on resettlement and what we found caused me deep concern,\u201d Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\nThe scope of \u201cinvoluntary resettlement,\u201d as the bank calls it, is vast. From 2004 to 2013, the bank\u2019s projects physically or economically displaced an estimated 3.4 million people, forcing them from their homes, taking their land or damaging their livelihoods, ICIJ\u2019s analysis of World Bank records reveals.\n\nThe true figure is likely higher, because the bank often fails to count or undercounts the number of people affected by its projects.\n\nA team of more than 50 journalists from 21 countries spent nearly a year documenting the bank\u2019s failure to protect people moved aside in the name of progress. The reporting partners analyzed thousands of World Bank records, interviewed hundreds of people and reported on the ground in Albania, Brazil, Ethiopia, Honduras, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Kosovo, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia, South Sudan and Uganda.\n\nIn these countries and others, the investigation found, the bank\u2019s lapses have hurt urban slum dwellers, hardscrabble farmers, impoverished fisherfolk, forest dwellers and indigenous groups \u2014 leaving them to fight for their homes, their land and their ways of life, sometimes in the face of intimidation and violence.\n\nAsia And Africa Resettled Nearly all of the estimated 3.4 million people who have been physically or economically displaced by World Bank-backed projects between 2004 and 2013 live in Africa or one of three Asian countries: Vietnam, China and India.

Sami Siva / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\n\nOn India\u2019s northwest coast, members of a historically oppressed Muslim community claim that heated water spewing from a coal-fueled power plant has depleted fish and lobster stocks in the once-fertile gulf where they make their living.

The bank is now in the middle of a rewrite of its safeguards policy that will set its course for decades to come.\n\nSome current and former World Bank officials warn that the proposed revisions will further undermine the bank\u2019s commitment to protecting the people it was created to serve. The latest draft of the new policy, released in July 2014, would give governments more room to sidestep the bank\u2019s standards and make decisions about whether local populations need protecting, they say.\n\n\u201cI am saddened to see now that pioneering policy achievements of the bank are being dismantled and downgraded,\u201d said Michael Cernea, a former high-ranking bank official who oversaw the bank resettlement protections for nearly two decades. \u201cThe poorest and most powerless will pay the price.\u201d\n\nThe bank says it has listened to the feedback and will release a revised draft with \u201cthe strongest, most state-of-the-art environmental and social safeguards.\u201d\n\nUnsettled History\n\nA man-made disaster in eastern Brazil in the late 1970s helped prompt the World Bank to adopt its first systematic protections for people living in the footprint of big projects.\n\nRising waters upstream from the Sobradinho Dam, built with World Bank financing, forced more than 60,000 people from their homes. Their relocation was poorly planned and chaotic. Some families fled their villages as water began pouring into their homes and fields, leaving behind herds of animals to drown.\n\nThe fiasco gave Cernea, the World Bank\u2019s first in-house sociologist, leverage to convince the bank to approve its first comprehensive policy for protecting people whose lives are upended by the bank\u2019s projects. Cernea based the new rules, approved by the bank in 1980, on a simple premise: People who lose their land, their homes or their jobs should get enough help to restore, or exceed, their old standard of living.\n\nUnder the World Bank\u2019s rules, governments seeking money from the bank must put together detailed resettlement plans for people who are physically or economically displaced.\n\nCurrent and former bank employees say the work of enforcing these standards has often been undercut by internal pressures to win approval for big, splashy projects. Many bank managers, insiders say, define success by the number of deals they fund. They often push back against requirements that add complications and costs.\n\nDaniel Gross, an anthropologist who worked for the bank for two decades as a consultant and staff member, said in-house safeguards watchdogs have \u201ca place at the table\u201d in debates over how much the bank is required to do to protect people. But amid the push to get projects done, they\u2019re frequently ignored and pressed to \u201cplay ball and get along,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an internal survey conducted last year by bank auditors, 77 percent of employees responsible for enforcing the institution\u2019s safeguards said they think that management \u201cdoes not value\u201d their work. The bank released the survey in March, at the same time that it admitted to poor oversight of its resettlement policy.\n\n\u201cSafeguards are irrelevant for managers,\u201d said one staffer who was surveyed for the report.\n\nAlbanian authorities used a World Bank-backed project to clear the way for a planned seaside resort, partly or completely tearing down 15 homes in the impoverished village of Jale. Andon Koka's home was flattened, and half of his brother's home (in background) was demolished. Besar Likmeta / BalkanInsight.com\n\nNo Consolation\n\nIn 2007, residents of Jale, a tiny Albanian beach hamlet on the Ionian Sea, found themselves in the path of a coastal cleanup effort backed by a $17.5 million loan from the World Bank. More than a dozen poor families lived in Jale, many in homes with add-ons and extra floors they rented to vacationers.\n\nAlbanian authorities had other plans for the seaside.\n\nThey saw Jale as an ideal spot for a high-end resort to lure tourists to the country. They decided to use the coastal restoration project \u2014 which was managed by the son-in-law of Sali Berisha, Albania\u2019s prime minister at the time \u2014 as a vehicle for turning the plan into a reality.\n\nBefore dawn one April morning, dozens of police officers streamed into the beach community, heading for structures previously identified in photos taken during aerial surveys paid for by the World Bank. The police rousted residents from their beds and forced them from their homes. Demolition crews leveled entire houses or tore down additions that the government said had been put up without proper permits.\n\nSanie Halilaj cried as work crews pulled down half of the house she had shared with her husband for more than half a century.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose a loved one, someone consoles you,\u201d the 74-year-old said in a recent interview. \u201cBut when you lose your home, there is no consolation.\u201d\n\nBank officials initially denied the evictions were connected to the bank-financed coastal initiative. But a year later, the bank\u2019s Inspection Panel found \u201cdirect links\u201d between the project and the demolitions. The panel slammed the bank for embarking on a \u201csystematic effort\u201d to obstruct its investigation, providing answers \u201cat times in total conflict with factual information which had been long known to management.\u201d\n\nAfter the panel\u2019s report was released in 2008, then-World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick called the bank\u2019s actions \u201cappalling.\u201d Zoellick vowed that the institution would swiftly \u201cstrengthen oversight, improve procedures and help the families who had their buildings demolished.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bank cannot let this happen again,\u201d he said.\n\nSeven years later, little has changed. In Jale, most residents still haven\u2019t received payment from the government for what they lost, even though the World Bank has covered their legal costs. At the bank, oversight remains weak.\n\nA 2014 internal World Bank review found that in 60 percent of sampled cases, bank staffers failed to document what happened to people after they were forced from their land or homes.\n\nSeventy percent of the cases sampled in the 2014 report lacked required information about whether anyone had complained and whether complaints were resolved, indicating the bank\u2019s mechanisms for dealing with grievances were \u201cbox-checking\u201d exercises that \u201cexisted on paper but not in practice,\u201d the in-house reviewers wrote.\n\nThese \u201csizeable gaps in information\u201d indicate \u201csignificant potential failures in the bank\u2019s system for dealing with resettlement,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe inability to confirm that resettlement has been satisfactorily completed poses a reputational risk for the World Bank.\u201d\n\nBen Hallman / The Huffington Post Victor Mendoza, the president of a farming co-op near the sprawling Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru, with his 10-year-old son.

Farmers like Mendoza claim it is polluting their water supply and threatening the health of their families and livestock. Read the story here\n\n\u2018They Abandoned Us\u2019\n\nMost World Bank investments do not require evictions or damage people\u2019s ability to earn a living or feed their families. But the percentage of those that do has increased sharply in recent years.\n\nA 2012 internal audit found that projects in the bank\u2019s pipeline triggered the bank\u2019s resettlement policy 40 percent of the time \u2014 twice as often as projects the bank had already completed.\n\nThe World Bank and IFC have also been boosting support for mega-projects, such as oil pipelines and dams, that the lenders acknowledge are most likely to cause \u201cirreversible\u201d social or environmental harm, an analysis by HuffPost and ICIJ found.\n\nA big project can upend the lives of tens of thousands of people.\n\nSince 2004, World Bank estimates indicate that at least a dozen bank-supported projects physically or economically displaced more than 50,000 people each.\n\nStudies show that forced relocations can rip apart kinship networks and increase risks of illness and disease. Resettled populations are more likely to suffer unemployment and hunger, and mortality rates are higher.\n\nThe World Bank acknowledges that resettlement is difficult, but says it\u2019s often impossible to build roads, power plants and other much-needed projects without moving people from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe stand by the need to continue financing infrastructure projects, including those that entail land acquisition and involuntary resettlement,\u201d said Theis, the World Bank spokesman.\n\nThe bank says it strives to make sure its borrowers provide real help to people pushed aside by big projects. In Laos, the bank says, authorities built more than 1,300 new homes with electricity and toilets, 32 schools and two health centers for thousands of people forced to move to make way for a World Bank-financed dam.\n\n\u201cThrough careful project design and proper implementation, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement have resulted in people\u2019s lives improving significantly,\u201d Theis said in a statement.\n\nIn a drought-haunted region of Brazil, farm families pushed aside by another World Bank-backed dam say that their lives haven\u2019t been improved.\n\nThirty-five families live in a tiny, government-built relocation village called Gameleira, named after the dam and reservoir that forced them to leave their homes along the Munda\u00fa River.\n\nIn their old homes, they could take water from wells and the river itself, but the relocation village has no fresh water source. A World Bank report acknowledged a delay in getting water access for the new village, but said the village\u2019s water issues had been solved by late 2012.\n\nThe villagers say that\u2019s not true. They are still waiting, four years after they were forced to relocate, for local authorities to keep their promise to build a small pipeline to draw water from the new reservoir to the relocation village. Meanwhile, water from the reservoir is being piped to urban areas.\n\nA well in the village produces salty water and, even with desalination equipment, each family is limited to 36 liters of water a day. Families supplement their supply by buying from commercial vendors, sometimes spending as much as a third of their modest incomes.\n\nThese purchases provide them enough water to irrigate small gardens of yuca, beans and corn. If they want to plant cash crops \u2014 such as cashews \u2014 they have to wait for rain, which hardly ever comes.\n\n\u201cWe feel that we are suffering so that people from the city can have water,\u201d 39-year-old Francisco Ven\u00edlson dos Santos, a farmer and father of four boys and two girls, said. \u201cThey abandoned us here.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement, the World Bank said it is satisfied the village was provided an adequate supply of water \u201cboth in terms of quantity and quality.\u201d The bank said it is helping Brazilian authorities deal with northeast Brazil\u2019s prolonged drought by helping \u201cto increase the resilience of small rural communities,\u201d giving them advice on drilling emergency groundwater wells and creating \u201cdrought preparedness plans.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim at a Berlin press conference. Tobia Schwarz / Getty Images\n\nShortcuts\n\nIn July 2012, an unconventional leader took over as the World Bank\u2019s new president. Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-American physician known for his work fighting AIDS in Africa, became the first World Bank president whose background wasn\u2019t in finance or politics.\n\nTwo decades before, Kim had joined protests in Washington, D.C., calling for the World Bank to be shut down altogether for valuing indicators like economic growth over assistance to poor people.\n\nHuman rights advocates and bank staffers working on safeguards hoped that Kim\u2019s appointment would signal a shift toward greater protections for people affected by World Bank projects.\n\nIn March, Kim said he was concerned about \u201cmajor problems\u201d in the bank\u2019s oversight of its resettlement policies. He announced an action plan calling for greater independence for the bank\u2019s safeguards watchdogs and a 15 percent funding boost for safeguards enforcement.\n\nBut while Kim and other bank officials have acknowledged general shortcomings, they have consistently denied that the bank shares blame for violent or wrongful evictions carried out by its borrowers.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the World Bank\u2019s Inspection Panel found the bank had violated its own rules by failing to acknowledge an \u201coperational link\u201d between a bank-funded health and education initiative and a mass relocation campaign carried out by the Ethiopian government. In 2011, soldiers carrying out the evictions targeted some villagers for beatings and rapes, killing at least seven, according to a report by Human Rights Watch and ICIJ\u2019s interviews with people who were evicted.\n\nAndreea Campeanu / International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Daily life in a refugee camp in South Sudan. Some of the camp\u2019s residents fled Ethiopia to avoid brutal evictions carried out by government forces. New evidence suggests the government\u2019s actions were funded by the World Bank. Read the story here\n\nKim said that while \u201cwe could have done more\u201d to help the evicted communities, the bank was ultimately not at fault.\n\nIn India, the IFC\u2019s internal ombudsman found that the lender had breached its policies by not doing enough to protect the large fishing community living in the shadow of the coal power plant it financed on the Gulf of Kutch. With Kim\u2019s approval, IFC\u2019s management rejected many of the ombudsman\u2019s findings and defended the actions of its corporate client.\n\nIn both Ethiopia and India, the World Bank Group declined to direct its clients to fully compensate the affected communities.\n\nIn response to complaints about the Badia East evictions in Nigeria, the World Bank embraced a shortcut that fell short of its promise that people affected by projects will be fully compensated for their losses.\n\nTypically, a community that claims it has been harmed by a bank project can file a complaint that will trigger an investigation by the bank\u2019s Inspection Panel.\n\nBut when three Badia East residents submitted a complaint, panel staffers held off launching an investigation. Instead, they guided the residents into a new pilot program for handling disputes. The program put the community into direct negotiations with the Lagos state government.\n\nMegan Chapman, then a lawyer for the Social and Economic Rights Action Center and now a co-founder of Justice & Empowerment Initiatives, represented the evicted residents. The Inspection Panel promised Chapman that the Badia East community could demand an investigation at any time if it wasn\u2019t satisfied with the outcome, according to emails reviewed by ICIJ.\n\nNegotiations didn\u2019t go well for the evicted residents. The Lagos government insisted they had been illegal squatters, even though some of them had lived there for decades. It gave the group an ultimatum: Accept a small payment and sign away any legal rights, or get nothing.\n\nChapman believed that the government\u2019s offer violated the bank\u2019s resettlement policy because it didn\u2019t provide new homes for the displaced or compensation equal to what they\u2019d lost. The payments that Lagos authorities offered for larger demolished structures, for example, were 31 percent lower than what the World Bank\u2019s own consultants said they were worth.\n\n\u201cIt was like David and Goliath. There were these little people fighting against this giant,\u201d Chapman said. The bank \u201creally left vulnerable people on their own.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s ultimatum divided the community. The leader of Chapman\u2019s organization said it was the best offer the evicted people were going to get. He said he was satisfied with the deal. Many residents and their advocates \u2014 including Chapman \u2014 objected.\n\nBut they had nowhere to turn for help.\n\nInternal emails obtained by ICIJ indicate that by early 2014, the Inspection Panel\u2019s chair, Eimi Watanabe, was already pushing to make sure that the panel would not investigate the World Bank\u2019s role in the case.\n\nAfter hearing that the leader of Chapman\u2019s group was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations, Watanabe urged her staff to issue a formal notice shutting down the possibility of any investigation before the fragile agreement fell apart, according to internal emails obtained by ICIJ.\n\n\u201cPl[ease] issue notice soonest before it unravels,\u201d Watanabe wrote on Feb. 6, 2014.\n\nWatanabe\u2019s directive didn\u2019t immediately kill the investigation, but over the following months the panel made it clear that it didn\u2019t want to dig deeper into the World Bank\u2019s actions.\n\nIn July 2014, two of the three residents who had filed the complaint told the panel they were unhappy with the deal and that they wanted to go forward with an investigation. The panel rejected their request and shut the case down with an official notice that said, as an aside, that the bank had fallen short of its own resettlement standards.\n\nChapman and other advocates say the bank misled them about how the pilot program would work and abandoned the people of Badia East.\n\nWatanabe did not respond to ICIJ\u2019s questions about the Lagos case.\n\nGonzalo Castro de la Mata, the Inspection Panel\u2019s current chair, said the panel \u201cdeliberated carefully at every stage of the case\u201d and did not seek to arbitrarily shut down the investigation before it could start.\n\nHe said that although the Lagos government had agreed to follow World Bank rules for resettlement in Badia East and other neighborhoods, the evictions weren\u2019t done under the official umbrella of the bank\u2019s urban renewal initiative. Because of this and other factors, he said, the panel determined that \u201ca lengthy process of investigation would not at the end of day necessarily yield better outcomes\u201d for residents who lost their homes.\n\nTony Karumba / GroundTruth Joseph Kilimo Chebet, a father of five, standing next to the burned remains of his homestead in Kenya, destroyed only hours prior by Kenya Forest Service officers.

It is being challenged by new competition from other development banks that don\u2019t have the same social standards \u2014 and are rapidly drawing support from the World Bank\u2019s traditional backers.\n\nChina has launched a new development bank and persuaded Britain, Germany and other American allies to join, despite open U.S. opposition.\n\nThese geopolitical shifts have fueled doubts about whether the World Bank still has the clout \u2014 or the desire \u2014 to impose strong protections for people living in the way of development.\n\nUnited Nations human rights officials have written World Bank President Kim to say they\u2019re concerned that the growing ability of borrowers to access other financing has spurred the bank to join a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d and push its standards for protecting people even lower.\n\nThe bank\u2019s proposed changes to its safeguard rules would grant many borrowers greater authority to police themselves. In the current draft, governments would be allowed to hold off on preparing resettlement plans until after the bank greenlights projects. They would also be permitted to use their own environmental and social policies instead of the bank\u2019s safeguards, as long as the bank determines these policies are consistent with its own.\n\nSome current and former bank officials say these changes would spell disaster for the people living in the growing footprint of the bank\u2019s projects \u2014 allowing governments to abide by weaker national standards and decide whether vulnerable populations need protecting after they have already received financing.\n\nIn December, the World Bank\u2019s biggest patron, the U.S. Congress, approved a measure directing the American representative on the World Bank board to vote against any future project that would be subject to weaker safeguards than the ones currently in place.\n\nThe bank says that the new rules would strengthen the protections for populations affected by its projects.\n\nTheis, the bank spokesman, said that under the proposed rules, \u201ca rigorous upfront scoping of the project is always required\u201d and borrowers still must prepare plans to address resettlement and other adverse impacts of projects \u201cwell in advance of any construction activities.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank officials are now writing a new version of the safeguards that they say will take into account the criticisms of their previous draft. They expect to release the new draft in the late spring or summer.\n\nIn the meantime, the bank continues to ramp up its investment in large infrastructure projects, like the one that claimed Bimbo Osobe\u2019s home in Badia East.\n\nOsobe spent months after her eviction sleeping under only a net for shelter, she said.\n\nAs of mid-March, she was staying in a medical clinic, sleeping in the reception area after the clinic closes at night. She\u2019s been forced to send three of her children away to stay with relatives, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is not a good thing for a family to be divided,\u201d Osobe said.",
