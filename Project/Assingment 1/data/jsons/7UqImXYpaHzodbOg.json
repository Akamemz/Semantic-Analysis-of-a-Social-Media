    "content": "The son , grandson and great-grandson of Baptist ministers , Dr. King was comfortable with the black church \u2019 s oral tradition , and he knew how to read his audience and react to it ; he would often work jazzlike improvisations around favorite sermonic riffs \u2014 like the \u201c dream \u201d sequence \u2014 cutting and pasting his own words and those of others . At the same time , the sonorous cadences and ringing , metaphor-rich language of the King James Bible came instinctively to him . Quotations from the Bible , along with its vivid imagery , suffused his writings , and he used them to put the sufferings of African-Americans in the context of Scripture \u2014 to give black audience members encouragement and hope , and white ones a visceral sense of identification .\nIn his \u201c Dream \u201d speech , Dr. King alludes to a famous passage from Galatians , when he speaks of \u201c that day when all of God \u2019 s children \u2014 black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics \u2014 will be able to join hands. \u201d As he did in many of his sermons , he also drew parallels between \u201c the Negro \u201d still an \u201c exile in his own land \u201d and the plight of the Israelites in Exodus , who , with God on their side , found deliverance from hardship and oppression , escaping slavery in Egypt to journey toward the Promised Land .\nThe entire March on Washington speech reverberates with biblical rhythms and parallels , and bristles with a panoply of references to other historical and literary texts that would have resonated with his listeners . In addition to allusions to the prophets Isaiah ( \u201c I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted , every hill and mountain shall be made low \u201d ) and Amos ( \u201c We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream \u201d ) , there are echoes of the Declaration of Independence ( \u201c the unalienable rights of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u201d ) ; Shakespeare ( \u201c this sweltering summer of the Negro \u2019 s legitimate discontent \u201d ) ; and popular songs like Woody Guthrie \u2019 s \u201c This Land Is Your Land \u201d ( \u201c Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York , \u201d \u201c Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California \u201d ) .\nSuch references added amplification and depth of field to the speech , much the way T. S. Eliot \u2019 s myriad allusions in \u201c The Waste Land \u201d add layered meaning to that poem . Dr. King , who had a doctorate in theology and once contemplated a career in academia , was shaped by both his childhood in his father \u2019 s church and his later studies of disparate thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr , Gandhi and Hegel . Along the way , he developed a gift for synthesizing assorted ideas and motifs and making them his own \u2014 a gift that enabled him to address many different audiences at once , while making ideas that some might find radical somehow familiar and accessible . It was a gift that in some ways mirrored his abilities as the leader of the civil rights movement , tasked with holding together often contentious factions ( from more militant figures like Stokely Carmichael to more conservative ones like Roy Wilkins ) , while finding a way to balance the concerns of grass-roots activists with the need to forge a working alliance with the federal government .\nAt the same time , Dr. King was also able to nestle his arguments within a historical continuum , lending them the authority of tradition and the weight of association . For some , in his audience , the articulation of his dream for America would have evoked conscious or unconscious memories of Langston Hughes \u2019 s call in a 1935 poem to \u201c let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed \u201d and W. E. B . Du Bois \u2019 s description of the \u201c wonderful America , which the founding fathers dreamed. \u201d His final lines in the March on Washington speech come from a Negro spiritual reminding listeners of slaves \u2019 sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation : \u201c Free at last , free at last ; thank God Almighty , we are free at last . \u201d",
