Like other recent polls and surveys , ours asked people whether they would be happy or unhappy if they had a child who married someone from the opposing party , Republican or Democratic .\nBut we added a new piece of information to this question , which said how often that new in-law would talk about politics . When people learned that their future in-law would rarely discuss politics , fewer than 30 percent said that they would be unhappy with an in-law from the opposing party . On the other hand , when we specified that the hypothetical in-law would never shut up about politics \u2014 he or she would interrupt social gatherings and holidays with the latest Trump dirt from MSNBC or Hannity tirade from Fox \u2014 more than 40 percent of people would be unhappy with the marriage .\nThis is especially true for those who do not strongly identify with a party , which includes nearly two-thirds of Americans . In this group , fewer than 20 percent said they would be unhappy with an in-law from the opposing party who rarely discussed politics . When , instead , their child \u2019 s chosen partner was a talkative member of the opposing party , this number doubled to 40 percent .\nPolarization , however , is not just about disliking the other side . True polarization is when you dislike the other party and really like your own party . Most people do not care enough about politics to say they are \u201c happy \u201d simply because their child is marrying someone from their political party . So when people in our studies were asked to consider a future in-law who rarely discussed politics , only 15 percent could be considered truly polarized . While this number grew to 25 percent among people who have strong connections to their party , it shrank to 10 percent of weak partisans .\nPolarization is also low among weak partisans when they are told that the in-law will frequently talk about politics . Weak partisans aren \u2019 t happy with an in-law from the opposing party discussing politics , but many are just as unhappy with an in-law from their own party who insists on political conversation .",
