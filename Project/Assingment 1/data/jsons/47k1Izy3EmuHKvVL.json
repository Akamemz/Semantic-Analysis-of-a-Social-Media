'\nHow a high-tech buggy destroyed the drone A 'drone-killer ' buggy chained to the deck of the USS Boxer is believed to be behind the attack which brought down an Iranian drone . The buggy uses highly sensitive radar to detect small incoming targets and then deploys signal blocking technology to sever the link between the drone and its control tower , causing it to fall from the sky . If the signal-jammer fails , then the buggy 's radar technology can be used to direct conventional missiles towards the same target to finish it off .
