He counts California \u2019 s liberal lieutenant governor , Gavin Newsom , as one and last year worked closely with Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein on a bill that delivered more water to the Central Valley . \u201c Kevin \u2019 s about the best I \u2019 ve known just with his getting-along skills , \u201d says Fred Barnes , executive editor of the influential conservative magazine The Weekly Standard .\nThe revelation that he was recorded last year saying he thought Trump was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 which he later claimed was a joke \u2014 threw a spotlight on a congressman whose work is mostly behind the scenes .\nThe Charlie Dent episode illustrated McCarthy \u2019 s singular place in Trump-era Washington . He has the ear of the White House and the confidence of his own caucus ( or most of it , at least ) . In turn , he is better positioned to get what he wants from the Trump administration than any other politician . Frank Luntz , the Republican pollster and an old friend of McCarthy \u2019 s , told me recently that he believes McCarthy will be the most powerful majority leader in decades . \u201c To my knowledge , Trump doesn \u2019 t listen to that many people . He \u2019 s got a very tightly controlled echo chamber , \u201d Luntz says . \u201c That Kevin carries influence with him really matters . \u201d\nThe first time I saw McCarthy work a room was at the Seven Oaks Country Club in Bakersfield . He was having breakfast with a hospital executive , and I was interviewing one of his biggest donors , the owner of a large carrot farm in the area . Almost everyone who knows him mentions McCarthy \u2019 s capacity to put people at ease , and it was on display . He seemed to know almost all the guests , shaking their hands , grasping elbows , greeting them with \u201c How \u2019 s the grandkids ? \u201d and offering to introduce a local banker to the new secretary of the treasury . As we left the building , McCarthy made a point to tell me that he grew up on the other side of town in a blue-collar neighborhood \u2014 that he didn \u2019 t belong to Seven Oaks or to any country club , for that matter .\nMcCarthy \u2019 s roots extend deeply in Bakersfield , an oil and agricultural city of 360,000 that anchors the lower half of California \u2019 s Central Valley . His great-grandfather arrived in 1883 and operated a cattle ranch . His father was an assistant fire chief . The family , McCarthy says , was not especially political ; like many in his generation , his father voted Democratic but gravitated toward the GOP when Ronald Reagan ran for president . By his own description , McCarthy was an indifferent high school student ; while attending community college , he opened a deli with $ 5,000 he won in the state lottery . The experience shaped his core political view \u2014 that government shackles small businesses , stifles the economy , and needs to be scaled back . McCarthy likes to tell the story of how the city slapped him with a citation for hanging the wrong kind of sign outside his shop : \u201c I \u2019 m just thinking , the sign brings in more people to buy more sandwiches , to pay more sales tax , to pay this guy to come and harass me . \u201d\nHe sold the deli after two years and enrolled at California State University , Bakersfield , where he received his B.A. , and then a master \u2019 s in business administration . Within a year of graduating , he was chairing the California Young Republicans and interning for local congressman Bill Thomas , chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee . Thomas was McCarthy \u2019 s opposite \u2014 he loved policy arcana and was known for his mean streak \u2014 but the two got along well . McCarthy eventually became the congressman \u2019 s district director , and after serving on the Kern Community College District board , he easily won election to the state Assembly in 2002 .\nKevin McCarthy , Congressman from Bakersfield and House Majority Leader visiting his childhood home in East Bakersfield . Photo by Brian L. Frank\nSoon after McCarthy took office , California experienced a political earthquake . For the first time in state history , voters recalled a sitting governor \u2014 Democrat Gray Davis \u2014 replacing him with a political neophyte , Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger . From the outset , McCarthy was an enthusiastic supporter .\nSchwarzenegger , like Trump , rode to victory as an outsider , amassing angry voters who distrusted government and wanted to upend the system . He was propelled by his celebrity and made a point to scapegoat Latino immigrants . ( Schwarzenegger ultimately overturned Davis \u2019 s decision to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver \u2019 s licenses . ) He was also accused of groping women , trash-talked other politicians , and held views not typical of Republicans ( he would sign landmark legislation to curb carbon emissions ) . Schwarzenegger and Trump would even share a campaign theme song : Twisted Sister \u2019 s \u201c We \u2019 re Not Gon na Take It . \u201d\nSchwarzenegger \u2019 s crude style and unorthodox embrace of the GOP created an opening for McCarthy . He positioned himself as the calm to his fire . The gentleman to his boor . The one who could translate the bizarre for the establishment . \u201c Kevin is very adept at looking at what people \u2019 s weaknesses are , and then he doesn \u2019 t attack you or criticize you \u2014 he finds a way to endear himself to you to fill the gap in that space , \u201d says Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez .\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez , a Democrat , became the Speaker of the Assembly shortly after Republicans in the Assembly elected McCarthy to be their leader in 2004 . They played basketball together many mornings and spent hours negotiating in Schwarzenegger \u2019 s Sacramento office . Democrats controlled both houses of the legislature but still needed Republican votes to pass the budget , giving McCarthy leverage . N\u00fa\u00f1ez calls McCarthy \u201c the best vote counter I know. \u201d He delivered the necessary GOP support , but not before receiving concessions for his members . Later , McCarthy helped push through a revamp of the state \u2019 s workers \u2019 compensation system , long a GOP goal , which he considers his biggest accomplishment while in Sacramento .\nMcCarthy was a master at making his fellow Republi\u200bcans feel included . He remembered wedding anniversaries and sent flowers to spouses . One year , he gave everyone in the caucus a personally engraved iPod . He turned the home he shared with other legislators into a clubhouse , with a pool table , a poker table , and a barbecue . In the evenings , he \u2019 d run his members through flash cards to make sure they mastered the procedural rules of the Assembly floor . Then , while everyone else relaxed over a game of cards or pool , he would ask what happened in committee that day , keeping tabs on everything that was going on .\nIn March 2006 , Bill Thomas announced he was retiring from Congress and made it clear that he wanted his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to succeed him . That November , McCarthy was elected to the House of Representatives in a landslide . One of the first things he did when he got to Washington was call on Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve met hundreds and hundreds of members of Congress \u2014 new ones , old ones , good ones , bad ones , \u201d Barnes told me , \u201c but I still have the capacity to be impressed , and in this case I was . He talked to me about what I soon realized was his great strength , and his great strength as a leader was in electoral politics . He was somebody who knew how to put together majorities , who knew how to win elections . \u201d\nThe oil industry along with agriculture drive Bakersfield \u2019 s economy . Photo by Brian L. Frank\nMcCarthy had raised more than $ 1 million for his own campaign , but confident that he would win in his heavily Republican district , he spent little of it on himself . He instead wrote checks to Republican candidates who faced tougher races , and traveled the nation to meet them . Barnes had never heard of a first-time candidate working on behalf of other candidates . It was a typical McCarthy move , both canny and generous , and it paid off immediately : Before he was sworn in , he had earned the allegiance of many of his new colleagues .\nFor McCarthy , Trump \u2019 s chaotic style matters less than the fact of his election , which put Republicans in control of Congress and the White House and poised them to reshape the judiciary .\nMcCarthy arrived in Washington at a precarious \u2014 and opportune \u2014 moment . Democrats had just retaken control of the House and Senate , Republicans were languishing under the deeply unpopular George W. Bush , and conservatives were searching for fresh faces . In 2007 , The Weekly Standard published a package of stories that profiled Virginia congressman Eric Cantor , Paul Ryan , and McCarthy , calling them \u201c the Young Guns. \u201d The magazine dubbed Cantor \u201c the leader , \u201d Ryan \u201c the thinker , \u201d and McCarthy \u201c the strategist. \u201d ( Barnes \u2019 s son eventually went to work for McCarthy \u2019 s political fundraising committee . )\nAt a now famous dinner of Republican and conservative leaders on the evening of Barack Obama \u2019 s 2009 inauguration , McCarthy was one of the more outspoken voices in the room . As recounted in Robert Draper \u2019 s \u201c When the Tea Party Came to Town , \u201d McCarthy argued for a scorched-earth approach in fighting the new president : \u201c We got ta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign. \u201d Then-Speaker John Boehner put McCarthy in charge of candidate recruitment , and he spent the next year crisscrossing the country enlisting people to run in the 2010 midterms .\nRob Stutzman , a GOP political consultant in Sacramento , remembers running into McCarthy in 2009 during a layover at the Denver airport . McCarthy was in the United Airlines lounge , poring over congressional district data . \u201c He \u2019 s identified all these seats that they think they can win . He \u2019 s on the phone recruiting and finding all these candidates , \u201d Stutzman says . \u201c He is busting his hump and sees this potential : \u2018 We can win a lot more seats than people think . \u2019 \u201d\nMcCarthy saw potential in relative unknowns like Kristi Noem , a telegenic rancher and state legislator from South Dakota , and Billy Long , an auctioneer and talk-radio host from southwestern Missouri . Buoyed by the wave of Tea Party activism , Noem , Long , and dozens of others swept into office . Many credited McCarthy for the Republicans \u2019 historic victory \u2014 they picked up 63 seats in the House , the largest swing in nearly 70 years \u2014 and his ascension within their ranks was assured . McCarthy was elected whip in 2011 . With victory , though , came challenges \u2014 primarily from his own members , many of whom didn \u2019 t share McCarthy \u2019 s passion for the deal .\nJust as he had in the state Assembly , McCarthy went out of his way to connect with caucus members \u2014 inviting them on early-morning bike rides , arranging movie nights , asking them to dinner . Framed photos of Republican House members , in constant rotation , decorate the foyer of his office . And McCarthy has raised at least $ 36 million over the past decade , much of it to help congressional candidates . When McCarthy announced his candidacy to be the Speaker of the House in 2015 , most assumed the job was his , but at the last minute he pulled out . He didn \u2019 t have the support of the Tea Partiers , who viewed him as too close to the establishment .\nAlong the way , McCarthy became famous for telling his colleagues to \u201c vote your district . Vote your conscience . Just don \u2019 t surprise me. \u201d Actor Kevin Spacey picked up the phrase while shadowing McCarthy as he prepared for the role of Frank Underwood on \u201c House of Cards. \u201d McCarthy initially resisted meeting with Spacey but agreed when he learned that the show \u2019 s conniving protagonist would be a Democrat .\nIn February of last year , when many Republicans were downplaying or outright dismissing Trump \u2019 s candidacy , McCarthy went on MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Morning Joe \u201d and said he thought Trump had a good chance of winning the Republican nomination . The specter of a President Donald Trump \u2014 still a punch line at that stage \u2014 didn \u2019 t seem to rattle McCarthy , not in public at least . \u201c Oh yeah , I think I could work with Donald Trump , \u201d he said .\nMcCarthy would later tell me , \u201c I do think it \u2019 s very helpful to have a disruptor . Having somebody question why we do what we do and still do it that way is very healthy. \u201d There was also something else at work : the shocking defeat of Eric Cantor \u2014 one of the Young Guns \u2014 in a 2014 primary by an obscure economics professor with little political experience .\nThus McCarthy \u2019 s early overtures to Trump were equal parts self-preservation and wanting to maintain good relations with all the factions in the Republican Party , including with the candidate whom party leaders feared the most . Trump , an obsessive TV watcher , took notice . The Morning Joe appearance led to a series of phone calls between the two , and throughout the campaign , McCarthy briefed Trump on the latest developments on Capitol Hill . A month before the election , after Ryan condemned Trump for his lewd and misogynistic comments captured on the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape , McCarthy served as liaison . \u201c I was one person who talked to everybody , \u201d he told me . \u201c I didn \u2019 t want to see either side tear the party apart . \u201d\nMcCarthy and Trump take a selfie on Inauguration Day . Photo courtesy of Kevin McCarthy\nMcCarthy and Trump have only grown closer since . On Inauguration Day , minutes before the ceremony began , the two men found themselves briefly alone inside the Capitol Building . McCarthy thought about how he could be helpful to the man about to take the oath of office . He wanted to make Trump feel protected and calm . He leaned toward the president-elect and said , \u201c You \u2019 re gon na do great. \u201d Then they took a selfie . In it , McCarthy \u2019 s face is obscured by the shadow of his outstretched arm .\nA few minutes later , the new president stood at the podium and attacked the leaders who surrounded him , saying that for too long \u201c the establishment protected itself , but not the citizens of our country. \u201d McCarthy , of course , is one of those leaders . Trump went on to paint a picture of doom , of what he called \u201c American carnage \u201d : impoverished families , crime-ridden streets , and \u201c rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape . \u201d\nAlthough McCarthy describes himself as an \u201c optimistic conservative , \u201d he says he was unfazed by the speech . Rather , he heard Trump delivering the same populist message that had led him to victory . It was a message that played especially well in his own district , which gave Trump the largest margin of any congressional district in California .\nFor McCarthy , Trump \u2019 s chaotic style matters less than the fact of his election , which put Republicans in control of Congress and the White House and poised them to reshape the judiciary . Trump \u2019 s election was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to implement many of the conservatives \u2019 long-desired goals : not just to repeal Obamacare and crack down on illegal immigration but to cut taxes , roll back regulations , and shrink government \u2014 what Trump chief strategist Stephen Bannon called the \u201c deconstruction of the administrative state . \u201d\nMcCarthy played a central role in the passage of the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) , the Republican-led bill to repeal Obamacare . In March , House Republicans canceled a vote on the bill after McCarthy and the Republican leadership failed to win over the hard-line Freedom Caucus . The defeat embarrassed McCarthy , and in the weeks that followed he kept in constant contact with the GOP \u2019 s different factions : the Freedom Caucus , the moderates of the Tuesday Group , and others on the fence . McCarthy and Trump stayed in touch , talking about twice a week as House leaders kept working on the bill .\nThen , on May 3 , McCarthy broke some news to a scrum of reporters gathered in the Capitol : The House would vote on repeal-and-replace the following afternoon . What \u2019 s more , McCarthy guaranteed its passage . At the time , it was far from clear that Republicans had the 216 votes they needed . A handful of McCarthy \u2019 s fellow California Republicans who represent swing districts suggested they were more likely to vote no . In the end , McCarthy delivered all 14 Republicans in California \u2019 s congressional delegation , many of whom already faced tough re-election campaigns . After the vote , Trump gathered Republican House members in the Rose Garden . McCarthy was giddy . He \u2019 d only been there a couple of times , but never to speak publicly . Now he stood at a lectern and praised Trump for being \u201c so hands-on \u201d in the health care debate .\nMcCarthy \u2019 s support for the bill hasn \u2019 t gone over well back home . More than 80,000 people in his district have received coverage through the Affordable Care Act , mostly through California \u2019 s Medicaid expansion . Before the repeal-and-replace vote , supporters of Obamacare protested outside his house and office . Editorials in The Bakersfield Californian have criticized McCarthy for avoiding town hall meetings and called the House bill a disaster that \u201c would have devastating implications for the community . \u201d\nSupporters of McCarthy stood guard outside his home as protesters marched by . Photo by Brian L. Frank Protesters opposed to McCarthy \u2019 s stance on health care and immigration marched toward his home . Photo by Brian L. Frank\nThe other major issue affecting his district is immigration . By most estimates , undocumented immigrants make up as much as 70 percent of the agricultural workforce in the Central Valley . More than a third of the residents in his district are Latino . The strip mall where McCarthy opened his deli 30 years ago now houses a Salvadoran pupusa restaurant and a Mexican carniceria .\nHis position on immigration is quintessentially McCarthyian , balancing the reality of his district \u2014 Big Ag \u2019 s reliance on undocumented migrant workers \u2014 and his party \u2019 s increasingly vocal nationalist wing . On the one hand , he supports more funding for border security and a wall on the Mexican border . But he says he also wants an overhaul of the nation \u2019 s visa system and a new guest worker program . Children brought here illegally by their parents \u2014 the so-called Dreamers \u2014 could conceivably have a path to legal status , he says , and deportation efforts should focus primarily on adults who crossed the border without permission .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely Congress will take on immigration reform this year , but McCarthy sees the potential for Trump to broker a major deal . \u201c If Nixon can go to China , \u201d he says , \u201c Trump is the one that could do immigration . If Nixon was the strongest guy against communism , then he was the only person trusted to go and create a relationship with China . Knowing Trump \u2019 s position when it comes to immigration , I think he \u2019 d have a trust level doing an immigration bill . \u201d\nFollowed up today 's CA GOP Congressional Delegation lunch by meeting with @ GOPLeader . Covered lots of ground . pic.twitter.com/lfM9B7j8xc \u2014 Governor Newsom Press Office ( @ GovPressOffice ) March 21 , 2017\nFor Arturo Rodriguez , the president of the United Farm Workers of America , whose headquarters are outside Bakersfield , McCarthy \u2019 s great failure is that he has not used his influence to lead on immigration reform . \u201c He \u2019 s really ignoring what is the heart of this valley , what is the heart of this county and the district he serves , \u201d Rodriguez told me . \u201c Everything revolves around agriculture , and you have to take care of the needs of the workers and the families that live here . \u201d\nThe most pervasive criticism of McCarthy is not his lack of command of policy but that his primary interest is the game of politics itself \u2014 a view summed up by Steve Schilling , who runs a network of health clinics for low-income residents in the Central Valley and has known McCarthy for years . \u201c I haven \u2019 t seen a particularly vivid legislative agenda or philosophy come forth from him , \u201d Schilling told me . \u201c It \u2019 s more about us versus them . The ability to win the game , if you will , versus attempting to really legislate on behalf of the mass of the people who sent him there . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s election has made McCarthy the most powerful Californian in Washington . What that means for his home state , though , is an open question . Last November , California voters rejected Trump by an almost two-to-one margin . Democrats hold every statewide office and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature , where the dominant conversation revolves around how to resist the president . Most California residents favor strict environmental regulations , oppose a border wall , support access to abortion , and don \u2019 t want to repeal Obamacare . Yet if the state has any chance at benefiting from the Trump administration , McCarthy will almost certainly be the reason . One day in March , he spent the morning in the White House alongside Trump and the afternoon behind closed doors in his office with Governor Jerry Brown . It \u2019 s difficult to imagine anyone else doing both .\nAccording to Lieutenant Governor Newsom , McCarthy \u2019 s biggest contribution to California may wind up being not what he does but what he prevents from happening . Newsom speculated that McCarthy \u2019 s firm belief in states \u2019 rights might help California when its policies collide with those of the federal government \u2014 about legal marijuana , for example , or strict pollution standards . A well-timed phone call from McCarthy could help avoid a conflict . \u201c It \u2019 s the things you don \u2019 t see , \u201d Newsom told me , \u201c the things we don \u2019 t write about , the headlines that never were , that I think ultimately could mark a collaboration with Kevin . \u201d",

By his own description, McCarthy was an indifferent high school student; while attending community college, he opened a deli with $5,000 he won in the state lottery. The experience shaped his core political view \u2014 that government shackles small businesses, stifles the economy, and needs to be scaled back. McCarthy likes to tell the story of how the city slapped him with a citation for hanging the wrong kind of sign outside his shop: \u201cI\u2019m just thinking, the sign brings in more people to buy more sandwiches, to pay more sales tax, to pay this guy to come and harass me.\u201d\n\nHe sold the deli after two years and enrolled at California State University, Bakersfield, where he received his B.A., and then a master\u2019s in business administration. Within a year of graduating, he was chairing the California Young Republicans and interning for local congressman Bill Thomas, chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Thomas was McCarthy\u2019s opposite \u2014 he loved policy arcana and was known for his mean streak \u2014 but the two got along well. McCarthy eventually became the congressman\u2019s district director, and after serving on the Kern Community College District board, he easily won election to the state Assembly in 2002.\n\nKevin McCarthy, Congressman from Bakersfield and House Majority Leader visiting his childhood home in East Bakersfield.

For the first time in state history, voters recalled a sitting governor \u2014 Democrat Gray Davis \u2014 replacing him with a political neophyte, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. From the outset, McCarthy was an enthusiastic supporter.\n\nSchwarzenegger, like Trump, rode to victory as an outsider, amassing angry voters who distrusted government and wanted to upend the system. He was propelled by his celebrity and made a point to scapegoat Latino immigrants. (Schwarzenegger ultimately overturned Davis\u2019s decision to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) He was also accused of groping women, trash-talked other politicians, and held views not typical of Republicans (he would sign landmark legislation to curb carbon emissions). Schwarzenegger and Trump would even share a campaign theme song: Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s crude style and unorthodox embrace of the GOP created an opening for McCarthy. He positioned himself as the calm to his fire. The gentleman to his boor. The one who could translate the bizarre for the establishment. \u201cKevin is very adept at looking at what people\u2019s weaknesses are, and then he doesn\u2019t attack you or criticize you \u2014 he finds a way to endear himself to you to fill the gap in that space,\u201d says Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez, a Democrat, became the Speaker of the Assembly shortly after Republicans in the Assembly elected McCarthy to be their leader in 2004. They played basketball together many mornings and spent hours negotiating in Schwarzenegger\u2019s Sacramento office. Democrats controlled both houses of the legislature but still needed Republican votes to pass the budget, giving McCarthy leverage. N\u00fa\u00f1ez calls McCarthy \u201cthe best vote counter I know.\u201d He delivered the necessary GOP support, but not before receiving concessions for his members. Later, McCarthy helped push through a revamp of the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, long a GOP goal, which he considers his biggest accomplishment while in Sacramento.\n\nMcCarthy was a master at making his fellow Republi\u200bcans feel included. He remembered wedding anniversaries and sent flowers to spouses. One year, he gave everyone in the caucus a personally engraved iPod. He turned the home he shared with other legislators into a clubhouse, with a pool table, a poker table, and a barbecue. In the evenings, he\u2019d run his members through flash cards to make sure they mastered the procedural rules of the Assembly floor. Then, while everyone else relaxed over a game of cards or pool, he would ask what happened in committee that day, keeping tabs on everything that was going on.\n\nIn March 2006, Bill Thomas announced he was retiring from Congress and made it clear that he wanted his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to succeed him. That November, McCarthy was elected to the House of Representatives in a landslide. One of the first things he did when he got to Washington was call on Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met hundreds and hundreds of members of Congress \u2014 new ones, old ones, good ones, bad ones,\u201d Barnes told me, \u201cbut I still have the capacity to be impressed, and in this case I was. He talked to me about what I soon realized was his great strength, and his great strength as a leader was in electoral politics. He was somebody who knew how to put together majorities, who knew how to win elections.\u201d\n\nThe oil industry along with agriculture drive Bakersfield\u2019s economy. Photo by Brian L. Frank\n\nMcCarthy had raised more than $1 million for his own campaign, but confident that he would win in his heavily Republican district, he spent little of it on himself. He instead wrote checks to Republican candidates who faced tougher races, and traveled the nation to meet them. Barnes had never heard of a first-time candidate working on behalf of other candidates. It was a typical McCarthy move, both canny and generous, and it paid off immediately: Before he was sworn in, he had earned the allegiance of many of his new colleagues.\n\nFor McCarthy, Trump\u2019s chaotic style matters less than the fact of his election, which put Republicans in control of Congress and the White House and poised them to reshape the judiciary.\n\nMcCarthy arrived in Washington at a precarious \u2014 and opportune \u2014 moment. Democrats had just retaken control of the House and Senate, Republicans were languishing under the deeply unpopular George W. Bush, and conservatives were searching for fresh faces. In 2007, The Weekly Standard published a package of stories that profiled Virginia congressman Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan, and McCarthy, calling them \u201cthe Young Guns.\u201d The magazine dubbed Cantor \u201cthe leader,\u201d Ryan \u201cthe thinker,\u201d and McCarthy \u201cthe strategist.\u201d (Barnes\u2019s son eventually went to work for McCarthy\u2019s political fundraising committee.)\n\nAt a now famous dinner of Republican and conservative leaders on the evening of Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, McCarthy was one of the more outspoken voices in the room. As recounted in Robert Draper\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tea Party Came to Town,\u201d McCarthy argued for a scorched-earth approach in fighting the new president: \u201cWe gotta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign.\u201d Then-Speaker John Boehner put McCarthy in charge of candidate recruitment, and he spent the next year crisscrossing the country enlisting people to run in the 2010 midterms.\n\nRob Stutzman, a GOP political consultant in Sacramento, remembers running into McCarthy in 2009 during a layover at the Denver airport. McCarthy was in the United Airlines lounge, poring over congressional district data. \u201cHe\u2019s identified all these seats that they think they can win. He\u2019s on the phone recruiting and finding all these candidates,\u201d Stutzman says. \u201cHe is busting his hump and sees this potential: \u2018We can win a lot more seats than people think.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcCarthy saw potential in relative unknowns like Kristi Noem, a telegenic rancher and state legislator from South Dakota, and Billy Long, an auctioneer and talk-radio host from southwestern Missouri. Buoyed by the wave of Tea Party activism, Noem, Long, and dozens of others swept into office. Many credited McCarthy for the Republicans\u2019 historic victory \u2014 they picked up 63 seats in the House, the largest swing in nearly 70 years \u2014 and his ascension within their ranks was assured. McCarthy was elected whip in 2011. With victory, though, came challenges \u2014 primarily from his own members, many of whom didn\u2019t share McCarthy\u2019s passion for the deal.\n\nJust as he had in the state Assembly, McCarthy went out of his way to connect with caucus members \u2014 inviting them on early-morning bike rides, arranging movie nights, asking them to dinner. Framed photos of Republican House members, in constant rotation, decorate the foyer of his office. And McCarthy has raised at least $36 million over the past decade, much of it to help congressional candidates. When McCarthy announced his candidacy to be the Speaker of the House in 2015, most assumed the job was his, but at the last minute he pulled out. He didn\u2019t have the support of the Tea Partiers, who viewed him as too close to the establishment.\n\nAlong the way, McCarthy became famous for telling his colleagues to \u201cvote your district. Vote your conscience. Just don\u2019t surprise me.\u201d Actor Kevin Spacey picked up the phrase while shadowing McCarthy as he prepared for the role of Frank Underwood on \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d McCarthy initially resisted meeting with Spacey but agreed when he learned that the show\u2019s conniving protagonist would be a Democrat.\n\nIn February of last year, when many Republicans were downplaying or outright dismissing Trump\u2019s candidacy, McCarthy went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and said he thought Trump had a good chance of winning the Republican nomination. The specter of a President Donald Trump \u2014 still a punch line at that stage \u2014 didn\u2019t seem to rattle McCarthy, not in public at least. \u201cOh yeah, I think I could work with Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCarthy would later tell me, \u201cI do think it\u2019s very helpful to have a disruptor. Having somebody question why we do what we do and still do it that way is very healthy.\u201d There was also something else at work: the shocking defeat of Eric Cantor \u2014 one of the Young Guns \u2014 in a 2014 primary by an obscure economics professor with little political experience.\n\nThus McCarthy\u2019s early overtures to Trump were equal parts self-preservation and wanting to maintain good relations with all the factions in the Republican Party, including with the candidate whom party leaders feared the most. Trump, an obsessive TV watcher, took notice. The Morning Joe appearance led to a series of phone calls between the two, and throughout the campaign, McCarthy briefed Trump on the latest developments on Capitol Hill. A month before the election, after Ryan condemned Trump for his lewd and misogynistic comments captured on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, McCarthy served as liaison. \u201cI was one person who talked to everybody,\u201d he told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see either side tear the party apart.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy and Trump take a selfie on Inauguration Day. Photo courtesy of Kevin McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy and Trump have only grown closer since. On Inauguration Day, minutes before the ceremony began, the two men found themselves briefly alone inside the Capitol Building. McCarthy thought about how he could be helpful to the man about to take the oath of office. He wanted to make Trump feel protected and calm. He leaned toward the president-elect and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna do great.\u201d Then they took a selfie. In it, McCarthy\u2019s face is obscured by the shadow of his outstretched arm.\n\nA few minutes later, the new president stood at the podium and attacked the leaders who surrounded him, saying that for too long \u201cthe establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\u201d McCarthy, of course, is one of those leaders. Trump went on to paint a picture of doom, of what he called \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d: impoverished families, crime-ridden streets, and \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.\u201d\n\nAlthough McCarthy describes himself as an \u201coptimistic conservative,\u201d he says he was unfazed by the speech. Rather, he heard Trump delivering the same populist message that had led him to victory. It was a message that played especially well in his own district, which gave Trump the largest margin of any congressional district in California.\n\nFor McCarthy, Trump\u2019s chaotic style matters less than the fact of his election, which put Republicans in control of Congress and the White House and poised them to reshape the judiciary. Trump\u2019s election was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to implement many of the conservatives\u2019 long-desired goals: not just to repeal Obamacare and crack down on illegal immigration but to cut taxes, roll back regulations, and shrink government \u2014 what Trump chief strategist Stephen Bannon called the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy played a central role in the passage of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Republican-led bill to repeal Obamacare. In March, House Republicans canceled a vote on the bill after McCarthy and the Republican leadership failed to win over the hard-line Freedom Caucus. The defeat embarrassed McCarthy, and in the weeks that followed he kept in constant contact with the GOP\u2019s different factions: the Freedom Caucus, the moderates of the Tuesday Group, and others on the fence. McCarthy and Trump stayed in touch, talking about twice a week as House leaders kept working on the bill.\n\nThen, on May 3, McCarthy broke some news to a scrum of reporters gathered in the Capitol: The House would vote on repeal-and-replace the following afternoon. What\u2019s more, McCarthy guaranteed its passage. At the time, it was far from clear that Republicans had the 216 votes they needed. A handful of McCarthy\u2019s fellow California Republicans who represent swing districts suggested they were more likely to vote no. In the end, McCarthy delivered all 14 Republicans in California\u2019s congressional delegation, many of whom already faced tough re-election campaigns. After the vote, Trump gathered Republican House members in the Rose Garden. McCarthy was giddy. He\u2019d only been there a couple of times, but never to speak publicly. Now he stood at a lectern and praised Trump for being \u201cso hands-on\u201d in the health care debate.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s support for the bill hasn\u2019t gone over well back home. More than 80,000 people in his district have received coverage through the Affordable Care Act, mostly through California\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Before the repeal-and-replace vote, supporters of Obamacare protested outside his house and office. Editorials in The Bakersfield Californian have criticized McCarthy for avoiding town hall meetings and called the House bill a disaster that \u201cwould have devastating implications for the community.\u201d\n\nSupporters of McCarthy stood guard outside his home as protesters marched by.

Frank\n\nThe other major issue affecting his district is immigration. By most estimates, undocumented immigrants make up as much as 70 percent of the agricultural workforce in the Central Valley. More than a third of the residents in his district are Latino. The strip mall where McCarthy opened his deli 30 years ago now houses a Salvadoran pupusa restaurant and a Mexican carniceria.\n\nHis position on immigration is quintessentially McCarthyian, balancing the reality of his district \u2014 Big Ag\u2019s reliance on undocumented migrant workers \u2014 and his party\u2019s increasingly vocal nationalist wing. On the one hand, he supports more funding for border security and a wall on the Mexican border. But he says he also wants an overhaul of the nation\u2019s visa system and a new guest worker program. Children brought here illegally by their parents \u2014 the so-called Dreamers \u2014 could conceivably have a path to legal status, he says, and deportation efforts should focus primarily on adults who crossed the border without permission.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Congress will take on immigration reform this year, but McCarthy sees the potential for Trump to broker a major deal. \u201cIf Nixon can go to China,\u201d he says, \u201cTrump is the one that could do immigration. If Nixon was the strongest guy against communism, then he was the only person trusted to go and create a relationship with China. Knowing Trump\u2019s position when it comes to immigration, I think he\u2019d have a trust level doing an immigration bill.\u201d\n\nFollowed up today's CA GOP Congressional Delegation lunch by meeting with @GOPLeader. Covered lots of ground. pic.twitter.com/lfM9B7j8xc \u2014 Governor Newsom Press Office (@GovPressOffice) March 21, 2017\n\nFor Arturo Rodriguez, the president of the United Farm Workers of America, whose headquarters are outside Bakersfield, McCarthy\u2019s great failure is that he has not used his influence to lead on immigration reform. \u201cHe\u2019s really ignoring what is the heart of this valley, what is the heart of this county and the district he serves,\u201d Rodriguez told me. \u201cEverything revolves around agriculture, and you have to take care of the needs of the workers and the families that live here.\u201d\n\nThe most pervasive criticism of McCarthy is not his lack of command of policy but that his primary interest is the game of politics itself \u2014 a view summed up by Steve Schilling, who runs a network of health clinics for low-income residents in the Central Valley and has known McCarthy for years. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a particularly vivid legislative agenda or philosophy come forth from him,\u201d Schilling told me. \u201cIt\u2019s more about us versus them. The ability to win the game, if you will, versus attempting to really legislate on behalf of the mass of the people who sent him there.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s election has made McCarthy the most powerful Californian in Washington. What that means for his home state, though, is an open question. Last November, California voters rejected Trump by an almost two-to-one margin. Democrats hold every statewide office and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, where the dominant conversation revolves around how to resist the president. Most California residents favor strict environmental regulations, oppose a border wall, support access to abortion, and don\u2019t want to repeal Obamacare. Yet if the state has any chance at benefiting from the Trump administration, McCarthy will almost certainly be the reason. One day in March, he spent the morning in the White House alongside Trump and the afternoon behind closed doors in his office with Governor Jerry Brown. It\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone else doing both.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Governor Newsom, McCarthy\u2019s biggest contribution to California may wind up being not what he does but what he prevents from happening. Newsom speculated that McCarthy\u2019s firm belief in states\u2019 rights might help California when its policies collide with those of the federal government \u2014 about legal marijuana, for example, or strict pollution standards. A well-timed phone call from McCarthy could help avoid a conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s the things you don\u2019t see,\u201d Newsom told me, \u201cthe things we don\u2019t write about, the headlines that never were, that I think ultimately could mark a collaboration with Kevin.\u201d",
