    "content": "Last year , a white male Princeton undergraduate was asked by a classmate to \u201c check his privilege. \u201d Offended by this suggestion , he shot off a 1,300-word essay to the Tory , a right-wing campus newspaper . In it , he wrote about his grandfather who fled the Nazis to Siberia , his grandmother who survived a concentration camp in Germany , about the humble wicker basket business they started in America . He railed against his classmates for \u201c diminishing everything [ he \u2019 d ] accomplished , all the hard work [ he \u2019 d ] done . \u201d\nHis missive was reprinted by Time . He was interviewed by the New York Times and appeared on Fox News . He became a darling of white conservatives across the country .\nWhat he did not do , at any point , was consider whether being white and male might have given him\u2014if not his ancestors\u2014some advantage in achieving incredible success in America . He did not , in other words , check his privilege .\nTo Robin DiAngelo , professor of multicutural education at Westfield State University and author of What Does it Mean to Be White ? Developing White Racial Literacy , Tal Fortgang \u2019 s essay\u2014indignant , defensive , beside-the-point , somehow both self-pitying and self-aggrandizing\u2014followed a familiar script . As an anti-racist educator for more than two decades , DiAngelo has heard versions of it recited hundreds of times by white men and women in her workshops .\nShe \u2019 s heard it so many times , in fact , that she came up with a term for it : `` white fragility , '' which she defined in a 2011 journal article as \u201c a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable , triggering a range of defensive moves . These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger , fear and guilt , and behaviors such as argumentation , silence and leaving the stress-inducing situation . \u201d\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement marched in the streets , holding up traffic , disrupting commerce , and refusing to allow `` normal life '' to resume\u2014insofar as normalcy means a system that permits police and vigilantes to murder black men and women with impunity\u2014white people found themselves in tense conversations online , with friends and in the media about privilege , white supremacy and racism . You could say white fragility was at an all-time high .\nI spoke with DiAngelo about how to deal with all the fragile white people , and why it \u2019 s worth doing so .\nSam Adler-Bell : How did you come to write about `` white fragility '' ?\nRobin DiAngelo : To be honest , I wanted to take it on because it \u2019 s a frustrating dynamic that I encounter a lot . I don \u2019 t have a lot of patience for it . And I wanted to put a mirror to it .\nI do atypical work for a white person , which is that I lead primarily white audiences in discussions on race every day , in workshops all over the country . That has allowed me to observe very predictable patterns . And one of those patterns is this inability to tolerate any kind of challenge to our racial reality . We shut down or lash out or in whatever way possible block any reflection from taking place .\nOf course , it functions as means of resistance , but I think it \u2019 s also useful to think about it as fragility , as inability to handle the stress of conversations about race and racism\nSometimes it \u2019 s strategic , a very intentional push back and rebuttal . But a lot of the time , the person simply can not function . They regress into an emotional state that prevents anybody from moving forward .\nSAB : Carla Murphy recently referenced `` white fragility '' in an article for Colorlines , and I \u2019 ve seen it referenced on Twitter and Facebook a lot lately . It seems like it \u2019 s having a moment . Why do you think that is ?\nRD : I think we get tired of certain terms . What I do used to be called `` diversity training , '' then `` cultural competency '' and now , `` anti-racism . '' These terms are really useful for periods of time , but then they get coopted , and people build all this baggage around them , and you have to come up with new terms or else people won \u2019 t engage .\nAnd I think `` white privilege '' has reached that point . It rocked my world when I first really got it , when I came across Peggy McIntosh . It \u2019 s a really powerful start for people . But unfortunately it 's been played so much now that it turns people off .\nRD : For white people , their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people , about moral or immoral singular acts , and if we \u2019 re good , moral people we can \u2019 t be racist \u2013 we don \u2019 t engage in those acts . This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over time\u2014that we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not \u201c doing . \u201d\nIn large part , white fragility\u2014the defensiveness , the fear of conflict\u2014is rooted in this good/bad binary . If you call someone out , they think to themselves , \u201c What you just said was that I am a bad person , and that is intolerable to me. \u201d It \u2019 s a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good , moral people .\nThe good/bad binary is also what leads to the very unhelpful phenomenon of un-friending on Facebook .\nSAB : Right , because the instinct is to un-friend , to dissociate from those bad white people , so that I \u2019 m not implicated in their badness .\nRD : When I \u2019 m doing a workshop with white people , I \u2019 ll often say , \u201c If we don \u2019 t work with each other , if we give in to that pull to separate , who have we left to deal with the white person that we \u2019 ve given up on and won \u2019 t address ?\nRD : Exactly . And white fragility also comes from a deep sense of entitlement . Think about it like this : from the time I opened my eyes , I have been told that as a white person , I am superior to people of color . There \u2019 s never been a space in which I have not been receiving that message . From what hospital I was allowed to be born in , to how my mother was treated by the staff , to who owned the hospital , to who cleaned the rooms and took out the garbage . We are born into a racial hierarchy , and every interaction with media and culture confirms it\u2014our sense that , at a fundamental level , we are superior .\nAnd , the thing is , it feels good . Even though it contradicts our most basic principles and values . So we know it , but we can never admit it . It creates this kind of dangerous internal stew that gets enacted externally in our interactions with people of color , and is crazy-making for people of color . We have set the world up to preserve that internal sense of superiority and also resist challenges to it . All while denying that anything is going on and insisting that race is meaningless to us .\nSAB : Something that amazes me is the sophistication of some white people \u2019 s defensive maneuvers . I have a black friend who was accused of `` online harassment '' by a white friend after he called her out in a harsh way . What do you see going on there ?\nRD : First of all , whites often confuse comfort with safety . We say we don \u2019 t feel safe , when what we mean is that we don \u2019 t feel comfortable . Secondly , no white person looks at a person of color through objective eyes . There \u2019 s been a lot of research in this area . Cross-racially , we do not see with objective eyes . Now you add that he \u2019 s a black man . It \u2019 s not a fluke that she picked the word `` harassed . '' In doing that , she \u2019 s reinforcing a really classic , racist paradigm : White women and black men . White women \u2019 s frailty and black men \u2019 s aggressiveness and danger .\nBut even if she is feeling that , which she very well may be , we should be suspicious of our feelings in these interactions . There \u2019 s no such thing as pure feeling . You have a feeling because you \u2019 ve filtered the experience through a particular lens . The feeling is the outcome . It probably feels natural , but of course it \u2019 s shaped by what you believe .\nRD : Yes . One of the things I try to work with white people on is letting go of our criteria about how people of color give us feedback . We have to build our stamina to just be humble and bear witness to the pain we \u2019 ve caused .\nIn my workshops , one of the things I like to ask white people is , \u201c What are the rules for how people of color should give us feedback about our racism ? What are the rules , where did you get them , and whom do they serve ? \u201d Usually those questions alone make the point .\nIt \u2019 s like if you \u2019 re standing on my head and I say , \u201c Get off my head , \u201d and you respond , \u201c Well , you need to tell me nicely. \u201d I \u2019 d be like , \u201c No . Fuck you . Get off my fucking head . \u201d\nIn the course of my work , I \u2019 ve had many people of color give me feedback in ways that might be perceived as intense or emotional or angry . And on one level , it \u2019 s personal\u2014I did do that thing that triggered the response , but at the same time it isn \u2019 t onlypersonal . I represent a lifetime of people that have hurt them in the same way that I just did .\nAnd , honestly , the fact that they are willing to show me demonstrates , on some level , that they trust me .\nRD : If people of color went around showing the pain they feel in every moment that they feel it , they could be killed . It is dangerous . They can not always share their outrage about the injustice of racism . White people can \u2019 t tolerate it . And we punish it severely\u2014from job loss , to violence , to murder .\nFor them to take that risk and show us , that is a moment of trust . I say , bring it on , thank you .\nWhen I \u2019 m doing a workshop , I \u2019 ll often ask the people of color in the room , somewhat facetiously , \u201c How often have you given white people feedback about our inevitable and often unconscious racist patterns and had that go well for you ? \u201d And they laugh .\nBecause it just doesn \u2019 t go well . And so one time I asked , \u201c What would your daily life be like if you could just simply give us feedback , have us receive it graciously , reflect on it and work to change the behavior ? What would your life be like ? \u201d\nAnd this one man of color looked at me and said , \u201c It would be revolutionary . \u201d\nSAB : I notice as we \u2019 ve been talking that you almost always use the word `` we '' when describing white people \u2019 s tendencies . Can you tell me why you do that ?\nRD : Well , for one , I \u2019 m white ( and you \u2019 re white ) . And even as committed as I am , I \u2019 m not outside of anything that I \u2019 m talking about here . If I went around saying white people this and white people that , it would be a distancing move . I don \u2019 t want to reinforce the idea that there are some whites who are done , and others that still need work . There \u2019 s no being finished .\nPlus , in my work , I \u2019 m usually addressing white audiences , and the `` we '' diminishes defensiveness somewhat . It makes them more comfortable . They see that I \u2019 m not just pointing fingers outward .\nRD : Well , yes . I continually struggle with that reality . By standing up there as an authority on whiteness , I \u2019 m necessarily reinforcing my authority as a white person . It goes with the territory . For example , you \u2019 re interviewing me now , on whiteness , and people of color have been saying these things for a very long time .\nOn the one hand , I know that in many ways , white people can hear me in a way that they can \u2019 t hear people of color . They listen . So by god , I \u2019 m going to use my voice to challenge racism . The only alternative I can see is to not speak up and challenge racism . And that is not acceptable to me .\nSAB : Yes , and racism is something that everyone thinks they \u2019 re an authority on .\nRD : That drives me crazy . I \u2019 ll run into someone I haven \u2019 t seen in 20 years in the grocery store , and they \u2019 ll say , \u201c Hi ! What \u2019 ve you been doing ? \u201d\nAnd they \u2019 ll go \u201c Oh , well you know . People just need to\u2014 \u201d\nAs if they \u2019 re going to give me the one-sentence answer to arguably the most challenging social dynamic of our time . Like , hey , why did I knock myself out for 20 years studying , researching , and challenging this within myself and others ? I should have just come to you ! And the answer is so simple ! I \u2019 ve never heard that one before !\nImagine if I was an astronomer . Everybody has a basic understanding of the sky , but they would not debate an astronomer on astronomy . The arrogance of white people faced with questions of race is unbelievable .",
