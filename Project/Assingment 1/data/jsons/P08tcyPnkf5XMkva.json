Intentional efforts to appeal to base emotions and drive each other to either/or positions will not help us make progress in this difficult area .\nFor example , I hear some say , \u201c life begins at conception \u201d as if that fact self-evidently finishes any discussion about whether a legal right to abortion should exist at all . Of course , it \u2019 s true that a form of life begins at conception . But many want to reduce or eliminate abortions by viewing the form of life at conception as equal in rights to the life of the woman bearing the child . This idea has little support from a historical , moral , spiritual , legal or constitutional perspective .\nThe argument that the form of life created at conception carries with it all constitutional guarantees has never been the law in this country . For good reason . Who , other than the woman carrying the unborn child , would we want to put in charge of enforcing the unborn child \u2019 s legal rights ? How would courts decide the circumstances under which someone other than the woman would step in to protect those rights ? There are formidable practical problems with weighing the legal rights of an embryo at conception equally with the mother \u2019 s legal rights .\nAs both an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a supporter of the legal need to have abortion options , I believe it \u2019 s critical that we move beyond headlines and deepen our understanding of the personal and public health aspects of abortion .\nMost spiritual leaders don \u2019 t view abortion as a black-and-white issue . The abortion policy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been in place for decades .
