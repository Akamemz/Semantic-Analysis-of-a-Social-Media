As a group , they surely did n't want to vote the debt limit increase down and own the ensuing market panic . But as individuals , none of them wanted their names associated with its passage .\nFor what seemed like an eternity ( but was actually only about 30 minutes ) the bill wobbled in limbo on the Senate floor with 58 votes -- 55 from Dems , three from Republicans -- two shy of the 60 required to break a filibuster and no GOP volunteers forthcoming .\nIt was at this point that Republican operatives across Washington began cursing Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , for having made a big show of erecting the 60-vote hurdle in the first place . Without a filibuster , Democrats could 've carried it by themselves . With a filibuster , at least five Republicans had to walk the plank . And they were n't going to do that without cover from GOP leaders , the two highest ranking of which are both in cycle this year .\nAfter a lengthy huddle , both of those leaders -- Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , and John Cornyn , R-Texas -- cast their votes to break the filibuster almost simultaneously .\nOnce the threshold had been cleared , seven more Republicans joined them . Each of these team players was seemingly willing to provide cover for their colleagues , but not if the leaders intended to leave them stranded after having aggressed the fight in the first place .\nAfter telling reporters the bill would likely fail , Sen John Thune , R-S.D. , a party leader himself , helped assure its passage . In the end it was n't even that close .\nWhen it was all over , the non-Cruz wing of the party expressed its gratitude to McConnell ( whose race is much more competitive than Cornyn 's ) for acting with courage and integrity . What they could n't say , but they knew full well , is that McConnell and Cornyn invited all of this upon themselves .\nFor three years now , McConnell has characterized every debt limit increase as a favor President Obama has requested of Congress -- a normatively bad thing Republicans simply would not agree to without some kind of equally partisan quid pro quo . And every time he 's revealed he was bluffing . In 2011 , twice in 2013 , and again on Wednesday . It even worked the first time !\nBut by treating what he knows to be a must-pass measure as a recurring source of leverage for Republicans , he helped foster an expectation among conservative voters that the debt limit would n't be increased without concessions from Democrats . That Republicans would never honor an Obama `` request '' like this without pocketing something significant in return .\nObama 's recognition of both the bluff and the tell came too late to escape the still-rolling catastrophe of the 2011 debt limit deal , but has since left McConnell and other GOP leaders without a plausible explanation for their mounting defeats . By McConnell 's own standard he 's done Obama 's bidding multiple times now , most recently without pocketing even a pretense of a concession .
