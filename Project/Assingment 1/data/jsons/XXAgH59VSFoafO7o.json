Known to Creeks as \u201c Sharp Knife \u201d for his viciousness during the 1814 Creek War , Jackson went on to become an advocate of removing eastern Indians to west of the Mississippi . Elected president in 1828 , he moved quickly to secure the Indian Removal Act and signed it into law on May 28 , 1830 . The Jackson monument at Lafayette Square has copies that can be found in Nashville ( Jackson \u2019 s hometown ) , New Orleans and Jacksonville , Fla . The statue \u2019 s immediate reference is to Jackson \u2019 s victory over the British in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans . More broadly , however , the statue celebrates the violent dispossession of Native Americans .\nWhen President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act , he claimed that moving dozens of Native nations west of the Mississippi was an act of benevolence . Speaking before Congress , he called the policy \u201c generous. \u201d Instead of \u201c utter annihilation \u201d \u2014 the future Jackson foresaw if Indians remained in the East \u2014 his policy \u201c kindly offers \u2026 a new home. \u201d Native people disagreed . Creek elders informed the president that eviction would be the \u201c worst evil that can befall them. \u201d Cherokees saw \u201c nothing but ruin before us . \u201d\nThe Creeks and Cherokees were right . The policy of removal had a catastrophic impact on these two Native nations and on dozens of other Native nations , both North and South .\nMany Americans have heard about the Cherokee Trail of Tears and the removal of the other \u201c Civilized Tribes \u201d \u2014 Choctaws , Creeks , Chickasaws and Seminoles \u2014 from the South . But removal was not just a project of white southerners to expand cotton production based on enslaved labor . In the free labor states of the North , federal and state officials , supported by farmers , speculators and business interests , evicted Shawnees , Delawares , Senecas , Potawatomis , Miamis , Wyandots , Ho-Chunks , Ojibwes , Sauks and Meskwakis . College-level textbooks touch on the southern removals but are silent about the northern trails of tears .\nA few removals took place without great loss of life , but most were terribly deadly . Of the 80,000 Native people who were forced west from 1830 into the 1850s , between 12,000 and 17,000 perished . The U.S. Army and state militias killed some in wars to break the resistance of noncompliant communities , but the large majority died of interrelated factors of starvation , exposure and disease ( malaria , cholera , typhus , smallpox and dysentery ) . To put this in perspective , the death toll ( 14 to 19 percent ) would be equivalent to between 46 million and 62 million of the current U.S. population .\nThe story of removal does not end with the trails of tears . West of the Mississippi , the catastrophe continued . Conditions were worst for the northern nations that were squeezed into eastern Kansas . The combined populations of these nations after first arriving in Kansas in the 1830s and 1840s was around 17,000 . On poor land with few resources , lacking clean water , subject to alcohol pushers and suffering severe social stress , these nations were vulnerable to a constant onslaught of multiple diseases . Low fertility and high infant mortality made it impossible to rebuild battered populations . By 1860 , their numbers had been cut in half . Conditions were not as bad for the southern nations , who were moved to Oklahoma , but they , too , experienced a further decline of between 13 and 19 percent from the 1840s to 1860s .\nThat \u2019 s not all . The trails of tears did not end in empty wilderness . The areas west of the Mississippi River were home to other indigenous nations \u2014 Osages , Kanzas , Omahas , Ioways , Otoes and Missourias . To make room for thousands of people from the East , the government dispossessed these nations of much their lands , subjecting them to similar forces of destruction that hammered the removed eastern nations . The combined population of these western nations was 9,000 in 1840 ; 20 years later , it had fallen to 6,000 .\nHistorians have been unsure about what to call Indian removal . Specialists have begun to propose alternative terms \u2014 eviction , expulsion and deportation \u2014 that more forcefully convey the policy \u2019 s brutality . Some scholars have referred to the policy as \u201c ethnic cleansing. \u201d Since ethnic cleansing is recognized as a crime against humanity under international law , this is a serious allegation .\nBut was removal genocide ? Americans have been reluctant to consider this possibility .
