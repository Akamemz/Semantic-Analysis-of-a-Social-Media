    "content": "As rescue and recovery efforts continue in Moore , Okla. , following the devastating tornado that struck Monday afternoon , attention has focused , in particular , on the schools that were hit \u2013 and in some cases , largely demolished .\nRescue workers pulled several students alive from the rubble of Plaza Towers Elementary School on Monday , but at least seven of the confirmed 24 dead from the tornado were students at Plaza Towers . It was unclear Tuesday whether there were still more students unaccounted for from the school .\nBriarwood Elementary was also severely damaged , though all students seem to have survived . Survivors from both schools have described terrifying scenes as roofs were ripped off and walls collapsed , and in several instances teachers protected students by lying on top of them . Teachers and students also spoke of following well rehearsed drills , hunkering down in bathrooms and closets , and holding backpacks and books over their heads for additional protection .\nIt \u2019 s too soon to know the ultimate cost of Monday \u2019 s tornado , in terms of both life and property , and certainly too soon to know whether the emergency procedures that the schools had in place were the best they could have been .\nExperts that have helped schools hone tornado-preparedness plans and who have seen the devastation they \u2019 ve caused in other communities note that with a tornado as strong as this one ( it was confirmed Tuesday as an EF5 on the Fujita scale , the highest ranking , after a preliminary designation as an EF4 ) there often isn \u2019 t a perfect solution , or any way to guarantee complete safety \u2013 though a lot of things can make a difference .\n\u201c If we had school in session [ when the Joplin tornado struck ] , we \u2019 d have been dealing with a lot of the same issues they \u2019 re dealing with in Moore , Okla. , now , \u201d says C.J . Huff , superintendent of the schools in Joplin , Mo. , where an EF5 tornado decimated the town in 2011 , killing 162 people .\nThe Joplin tornado struck on a Sunday afternoon , when the school buildings were empty . But , says Dr. Huff , 10 school facilities were hit by the tornado , and nine of those were completely destroyed . He was able to watch some video footage of the hallways afterward \u2013 hallways that , in the past , had been designated as shelter areas for kids during a tornado .\n\u201c Those hallways become big wind tunnels when you have that much force , \u201d he says , describing debris and projectiles that shot through them . \u201c We don \u2019 t shelter kids in hallways any longer . We move them to interior classrooms and bathrooms and areas away from hallways. \u201d In addition , Joplin has used FEMA and other grant money to add safe rooms within all of the schools it \u2019 s rebuilding , ones that can serve not just students and faculty but others from the community as well .\n\u201c If you live in Tornado Alley , [ building safe rooms ] is certainly something you \u2019 ve got to take a look at , \u201d says Huff .\nWith the high frequency of tornadoes in Oklahoma , hundreds of schools in the state do have FEMA-certified shelters , but neither Plaza Towers nor Briarwood had one . Officials Tuesday said that it \u2019 s up to each jurisdiction to set priorities for which schools get funds for safe rooms , but emphasized that having one wouldn \u2019 t necessarily have saved more lives .\nThe main reason that schools lack them is cost . Especially for an existing school , retrofitting it with a storm shelter can be cost-prohibitive . FEMA has funds available in communities that have been hit by a tornado before \u2013 as Moore was in 1999 \u2013 but retrofitting undamaged buildings can still be cost-prohibitive and in many cases involve substantial red tape , says Steve Satterly , director of transportation and school safety for Southern Hancock Schools in New Palestine , Ind. , and an expert on school tornado safety .\nWhen Henryville , Ind. , was hit last year by an EF4 tornado and two schools were largely destroyed , they opted not to rebuild with a shelter , he notes . Doing so would have involved a lot of bureaucratic hoops and a big delay , and there was strong interest in getting the schools reopened as soon as possible to help the community rebound and get back to normal .\nIn addition , Mr. Satterly notes that hindsight can be perfect , but that many of the decisions schools have to make around tornadoes happen in an instant , with a situation that \u2019 s impossible to predict .\nThe high school in Enterprise , Ala. , hit by an EF4 tornado on March 1 , 2007 , was criticized by many for not sending students home when there were tornado warnings , and eight students in the school were killed . But the intense storms throughout the day would have made sending the students home highly risky , Satterly says , noting that buses are often the worst place to be , and that Enterprise actually did everything by the book .\n\u201c Sometimes , \u201d he says , \u201c no matter what you do you \u2019 re still in extreme danger because of the strength of the tornado . \u201d\nIn Henryville , officials actually did send students home , since many were already in buses . It wasn \u2019 t an ideal situation and could have ended badly , but worked out ; the buses got out of the way , the students all survived , and the school buildings suffered extreme damage . Had students been there , they would likely have been hurt .\n\u201c One of the lessons you get from all of [ these instances ] is that you want to plan ahead what you \u2019 re going to do , practice what you \u2019 re going to do , and when it hits , you \u2019 ve got to stick with that plan , \u201d says Satterly .\nAt Plaza Towers , older children from the school were apparently bused to a church \u2013 which turned out to be out of the path of the tornado \u2013 while younger students stayed behind . It wasn \u2019 t yet clear Tuesday why that decision was made , but emergency experts said that it may not always be feasible to evacuate students from a school , and younger students can be particularly tricky to move , since they often aren \u2019 t as good at following instructions . In addition , schools are often considered the safest buildings in a community \u2013 though when hit directly by a powerful tornado , that may still not be enough .\nPlaza Towers apparently did have a basement \u2013 which in many cases , say experts , is one of the safest places to go . And yet the seven students who are confirmed to have died in the school may have drowned there . `` Some of the children drowned because they were in the basement area , water came in , '' Oklahoma Lt. Gov . Todd Lamb told CNN . ( A later report from emergency management officials indicated the students who died may actually have been sheltering in above-ground classrooms . )\nFloodwaters can certainly be a danger in a basement , but that doesn \u2019 t mean that basements aren \u2019 t still one of the safest places to ride out a tornado , says Paul Timm , president of RETA Security , an Illinois company that specializes in school security .\n\u201c This is a game of risk management , \u201d says Mr. Timm . \u201c We \u2019 re never going to get it to zero. \u201d Being in a hallway that turns into a wind tunnel is generally far riskier than a basement , he says , noting that it \u2019 s highly possible that many of the actions Plaza Towers and Briarwood took saved dozens or hundreds of student lives , even with the seven fatalities .\nTimm and other experts agree that many of the protocols adults grew up on are now considered outdated .
