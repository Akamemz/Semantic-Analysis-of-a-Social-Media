    "content": "From allowing Iran to keep enriching uranium to abandoning \u201c anywhere , anytime \u201d inspections of Tehran \u2019 s nuclear facilities , the Obama administration has crossed many of its own red lines in the nuclear deal that will lift tough economic sanctions on America \u2019 s longtime adversary .\nIn December 2013 , Secretary of State John F. Kerry said one of the requirements of a good deal with Iran would be to \u201c help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. \u201d He said it was \u201c the whole point \u201d of the sanctions .\nBut the actual deal ? It doesn \u2019 t require Iran to dismantle its nuclear program . Iran gets to keep some of its uranium-enriching centrifuges and other aspects of its infrastructure .\nIn November 2013 , Mr. Kerry said Iran has \u201c no right to enrich \u201d uranium .\nThe actual deal ? Iran gets to continue enriching uranium , although it must get rid of two-thirds of its centrifuges and can \u2019 t enrich the material to weapons grade .\nPresident Obama said he wanted inspections \u201c anywhere , anytime \u201d of Iran \u2019 s nuclear facilities to ensure Tehran is adhering to terms of the deal .\nBut the actual agreement ? Iran gets 24 days \u2019 notice of inspections of suspicious sites . A secret side deal allows Tehran \u2019 s own inspectors to check a military site where work on nuclear weapons was thought to have been carried out .\n\u201c To be conservative , I \u2019 d say at least a dozen red lines have been crossed , \u201d said Michael Rubin , a security specialist at the American Enterprise Institute . \u201c John Kerry is about as credible as Baghdad Bob and probably no more interested in the predominance of American security . \u201d\nThe president and his advisers defend the deal as the best possible and say it will prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons . White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the agreement \u201c will be a significant constraint on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program . \u201d\n\u201c This is reducing their uranium stockpile by 98 percent , unplugging thousands of centrifuges , essentially gutting the core of their plutonium heavy water reactor and agreeing with the [ International Atomic Energy Agency \u2019 s ] request for information and access that \u2019 s required to complete their report about the possible military dimensions of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program , \u201d Mr . Earnest said .\nIn Vienna , Iranian officials warned the U.N. agency Tuesday not to bow to pressure from Congress to detail its investigation into Tehran \u2019 s past nuclear work , saying Iran will not accept any leaks of their discussions .\nIranian Ambassador Reza Najafi said accusations that Iran ever worked on nuclear weapons were baseless .\n\u201c The IAEA should at the same time exercise utmost vigilance to ensure full protection of all confidential information coming to its knowledge , \u201d Mr. Najafi told reporters . \u201c We won \u2019 t accept any kind of leakage of classified information by anyone . \u201d\nThe resistance from Iran prompted Rep. Mike Pompeo , Kansas Republican and a prominent critic of the deal , to renew his call for the administration to release any secret side deals between the IAEA and Iran .\n\u201c From refusing to let the United States see the secret side agreements , to failing to explain if the IAEA will be allowed to inspect its Parchin military site , Iran is already acting as a bully \u2014 dodging questions and telling lies to hide its bad behavior , \u201d Mr. Pompeo said . \u201c Every member of Congress must at least demand that the administration provide us with this entire agreement before we have to vote on this critically important matter of national security . \u201d\nCritics in Congress and elsewhere point to the administration \u2019 s own words to outline how the deal falls short of what the U.S. hoped to achieve .\nThe Foreign Policy Initiative , a right-leaning think tank in Washington , has highlighted at least 20 areas of the agreement where the administration \u2019 s rhetoric doesn \u2019 t jibe with the text of the accord . For example , in 2013 , Mr. Obama said he envisioned a deal that was so restrictive of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program \u201c that they , as a practical matter , do not have breakout capacity \u201d to build atomic weapons .\nThe agreement , however , contains many provisions that expire after a decade or 15 years , making it impossible to claim that it permanently blocks Iran \u2019 s path to nuclear weapons . The president told NPR in an interview this month , \u201c Essentially we \u2019 re purchasing , for 13 , 14 , 15 years , assurances that the breakout is at least a year . \u201d\nThe easing of sanctions is another issue . Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told Congress this summer that \u201c we should under no circumstances relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking . \u201d\nBut under the nuclear agreement , sanctions on conventional arms are to be lifted in five years and missile sanctions in eight years .\nJames Phillips , a senior research fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at The Heritage Foundation , also criticized \u201c crazy \u201d provisions in the agreement that will protect Iran from certain \u201c snapback \u201d sanctions on deals that Tehran signs between the lifting of sanctions and any violation of the nuclear accord .\nMr. Obama continues to lobby lawmakers ahead of next month \u2019 s vote in Congress on a resolution disapproving of the Iranian deal .\nSen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan became the latest in a string of Democrats on Monday to back the agreement , bringing to 28 the number of senators supporting it .\n\u201c The imminent threat of Iran having a nuclear weapon outweighs any flaws I see in the international agreement , \u201d Ms. Stabenow said . \u201c For this reason , I must support the agreement . \u201d\nMr. Obama must have at least 34 backers in the Senate to sustain his veto of the resolution .\nTwo Democratic senators , Charles E. Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey , have announced that they will oppose the deal .\nMr. Obama further riled some opponents Monday night by saying that he and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , must \u201c deal with the crazies \u201d on various issues before they leave office . Rep. Diane Black , Tennessee Republican , was among those who took offense , thinking the president was referring to opponents of the Iran agreement .\n\u201c First , he likened opponents of his deal to Iranian hard-liners chanting \u2018 Death to America \u2019 and now , in an even lazier line of attack , he \u2019 s simply resorted to calling us \u2018 crazies , \u2019 \u201d she said Tuesday . \u201c What \u2019 s \u2018 crazy \u2019 in my book is cutting a deal with the world \u2019 s leading state sponsor of terrorism that allows at least 24 days to slow-walk nuclear inspections , that gives our expressed permission to continue enrichment , and gives Iran more than $ 100 billion in sanctions relief that will inevitably be funneled to terrorist proxy groups . \u201d\nWhite House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Tuesday that Mr. Obama might have been flip with the remark , but he wasn \u2019 t referring to opponents of the Iran deal .\nThe White House circulated a letter Monday by Rep. Seth Moulton , a Massachusetts Democrat and Iraq War veteran who supports the accord . Mr. Moulton said there is no better deal because allies won \u2019 t push for more sanctions if the U.S. walks away from the agreement .\nHe also said taking military action against Iran \u201c would once again imperil the lives of Americans to achieve much less than this deal achieves by diplomatic means . \u201d\n\u201c Military action would only set Iran \u2019 s nuclear program back a few years at most , reaffirm their pursuit of a nuclear weapon , and drive the program underground , \u201d Mr. Moulton said .\nSome critics of the deal said Iranians realized that the president could concede on the nuclear agreement because he backed away from his \u201c red line \u201d three years ago on Syria \u2019 s use of chemical weapons .\nSen. Tom Cotton , Arkansas Republican , said Mr. Obama flinched in his showdown with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad .\n\u201c Anyone with eyes , \u201d he said , \u201c could conclude that the president doesn \u2019 t stick by his red lines . They also knew that since he was term-limited , he had a hard and fast negotiating deadline , which they didn \u2019 t really have . I think they used his political deadline against him . \u201d\nMr. Obama has said repeatedly that \u201c no deal is better than a bad deal. \u201d In the eyes of his critics , it \u2019 s just one more red line that he has crossed .",
