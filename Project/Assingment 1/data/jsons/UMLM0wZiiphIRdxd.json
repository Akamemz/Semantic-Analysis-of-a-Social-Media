You really have to be squinched . If you \u2019 re all laid out , there \u2019 s not enough room for everybody . People are so close to you and they \u2019 re right next to you , and sometimes people sit on your legs on accident . Sometimes , if you lean your head , you can feel the other person \u2019 s hair .

We heard it , \u201c We will be entering a lockdown drill , please prepare. \u201d So we go in the locker room , and I \u2019 m standing there . I start playing with my fingers because I \u2019 m incredibly bored . And the gym teacher , who I don \u2019 t particularly like , decided to put me up to the front because he did not like me playing with my fingers because he thought it was distracting to other children . I was not making a sound . And then I sneezed . And everybody thought I was dabbing . Dabbing is sort of a dance move from a few years ago . So then he gave me detention because he thought I was trying to get everybody to laugh .\n\u201c Why we would do the lockdown drill ? Because if a wild animal or a robber or something came barging in . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio . Here is a link to the audio instead .

So , how the teacher explained it , she was thinking , like , if a wild animal came , and we hid in the bathroom\u2014if it were a mouse or something , we probably wouldn \u2019 t have to do that . But if it were a zebra or lion or something . Now there were spiders in the bathroom and some people were afraid of spiders , but they still had to go in , they just had to hug my kindergarten teacher . But it was nothing to be afraid of , they were daddy longlegs . But some spiders are poisonous , and I \u2019 m afraid of those .\n\u201c I was very frightened . The stranger was literally just outside the door of our classroom . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio . Here is a link to the audio instead .

And I was very frightened , and I got a feeling stuck in my head about\u2026 I was thinking if we were going to be OK because the stranger was literally just outside the door of our classroom . And it was actually just our principal dressed in stranger clothes . I saw her wearing , like , a boy wig with her hair up in a bun . She had , like , a white shirt , a green tank top , and some , like , grayish blueish pants . I thought it was kind of scary because I didn \u2019 t know who her true self was . So , we hid in the backroom or the closet . And it was very crowded , and we were very quiet .\n\u201c I remember it being a very weird shift from thinking about calculus to how I would escape if someone had a gun in my school . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

So the idea with ALICE is that it gives us more options . Basically what they \u2019 re telling us is that we have permission and that we \u2019 re encouraged to counter a shooter if given the opportunity . Countering always comes up . Some people have some fun with it because they \u2019 re , like , \u201c OK , what can I throw at this person ? \u201d And to some extent , it \u2019 s kind of just being ridiculous because a water bottle isn \u2019 t going to be a fair match against an AR-15 . And we all kind of know that . But we \u2019 re also being serious at the same time because it \u2019 s kind of all we have .\n\u201c If it happens\u2014a school shooting\u2014I could risk my life , and I don \u2019 t want to do that , so I want to learn how to do it correctly . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

It \u2019 s very unorganized , the drills . We were talking and then there was a moment of silence for a straight minute , and it was really creepy . I \u2019 m thinking : Are we ever going to get up ? Is the teacher ever going to say anything ? After the drill at recess , I just didn \u2019 t do anything , I just sat there and thought about everything . I thought there was going to be more action . We could have done a lot more than just sat there the whole time .\n\u201c We got to our places and got heavy things . \u2026 There \u2019 s spheres and rectangles and triangles . I got the sphere because that \u2019 s the heaviest thing . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio . Here is a link to the audio instead .

And the thing that I got was heavy blocks . There \u2019 s like spheres and rectangles and triangles . So I got this sphere because that \u2019 s the heaviest thing . But there \u2019 s only three spheres . I got one , but the rest of the class got other shapes . And then the teacher pretended to be the bad guy in the school .\n\u201c Some of our teachers do have plans : \u2018 Well if a shooter tries to butt their gun in through the glass of the door , I \u2019 ll grab the gun . \u2019 \u2019 \u2019\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

And we go : I \u2019 d totally be able to this , that , and the other . But I think practically , knowing myself , I would be in abject terror , and it would almost be hard to get myself to do anything , much less heft a heavy object at someone trying to get in . If I had to rank on all this , of things I would be worried about in school , I think it would be : No . 1 , getting a bad grade . No . 2 , school shooter .\n\u201c But then all the teachers tell you , \u2018 You should have a worst-case scenario in your mind. \u2019 And I don \u2019 t get why they do that . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

At first I didn \u2019 t get it , but now I \u2019 ve heard all these stories , I sort of really get why they tell us to . When I heard about the first school shooting I \u2019 m , like , wow that \u2019 s why we do lockdown drills . We get the Seattle Times every morning , and it was on the front page of the Seattle Times , and I \u2019 m pretty sure I asked my friends , and they told me that it \u2019 s a very sad story . That \u2019 s a reason to be afraid . But having a little drill is not a reason to be afraid .\n\u201c If a real intruder came , I think since I \u2019 m used to it now , I wouldn \u2019 t be so scared by it . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

And then we heard our principal tell us on the speaker there was an intruder drill . We heard someone bang on the door , like [ knock , knock , knock ] . I knew it was the principal at the time . It was a little scary because it was loud , and very dark in the room . And then it just stopped . Sometimes I worry about intruder drills , whenever it \u2019 s done . If a real intruder came , I think since I \u2019 m used to it now , I wouldn \u2019 t be so scared by it .\n\u201c I was genuinely not sure if I would finish the day alive . \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

Maybe this is a super common feeling or maybe nobody feels this way . It \u2019 s hard to tell , because people don \u2019 t talk about it much . That drill made me get mad at the school and everything . It really made me angry and sad and feel kind of trapped , because what am I supposed to do ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s not the kind of thing I want to be thinking about . I want to be like , \u2018 I hope I finish this Spanish assessment. \u2019 I don \u2019 t want to be thinking about , \u2018 How can I best hide from a shooter ? \u2019 \u201d\nYour browser does n't support HTML5 audio .

Open all the blinds but take everything off the desks , so it looks like an empty classroom .

We locked the doors , made sure every window was locked and every blind is closed on each window . We hide and sit . Everybody was acting all goofy and playing . I was about to cry because I didn \u2019 t know if it was real or not , and everybody was just freaking out and acting like fools , like they didn \u2019 t know what to do . They knew what they were doing , but instead of just going straight to where they were supposed to go , they were playing . I was behind my teacher \u2019 s desk , by the wall , scared , crunched up , with my head in my legs , about to cry .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary .

The next day, in my journalism 2 class, the teacher mentioned that we were far from many entrances, and we have many exits in our room, so we would probably be able to evacuate fine. And then my chemistry teacher talked about how we could all huddle into the chemical closet, and if a shooter came in, we could splash chemicals in their eyes or whatnot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty calm about it because we do it a lot.\u201d\n\nRoxy\n\nFourth grade\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

My teacher says, \u201cLockdown, everybody in the corner,\u201d turns off the lights, and then he locks the door, and then we sit down. We basically sit behind the desk, like a big clump. You really have to be squinched. If you\u2019re all laid out, there\u2019s not enough room for everybody. People are so close to you and they\u2019re right next to you, and sometimes people sit on your legs on accident. Sometimes, if you lean your head, you can feel the other person\u2019s hair. We\u2019re pretty calm about it sometimes because we do it a lot.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s kinda fun\u2014you\u2019re under a desk, you look at your friend, you giggle. \u2026 The teachers try to make it a serious thing, but it never really is.\u201d\n\nColin\n\n10th grade\n\nMetuchen, New Jersey\n\nColin, age 15.\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

We heard it, \u201cWe will be entering a lockdown drill, please prepare.\u201d So we go in the locker room, and I\u2019m standing there. I start playing with my fingers because I\u2019m incredibly bored. And the gym teacher, who I don\u2019t particularly like, decided to put me up to the front because he did not like me playing with my fingers because he thought it was distracting to other children. I was not making a sound. And then I sneezed. And everybody thought I was dabbing. Dabbing is sort of a dance move from a few years ago. So then he gave me detention because he thought I was trying to get everybody to laugh.\n\n\u201cWhy we would do the lockdown drill? Because if a wild animal or a robber or something came barging in.\u201d\n\nFoster\n\nFirst grade\n\nSeattle\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a link to the audio instead.

So, how the teacher explained it, she was thinking, like, if a wild animal came, and we hid in the bathroom\u2014if it were a mouse or something, we probably wouldn\u2019t have to do that. But if it were a zebra or lion or something. Now there were spiders in the bathroom and some people were afraid of spiders, but they still had to go in, they just had to hug my kindergarten teacher. But it was nothing to be afraid of, they were daddy longlegs. But some spiders are poisonous, and I\u2019m afraid of those.\n\nLeah, age 6.\n\n\u201cI was very frightened.

And I was very frightened, and I got a feeling stuck in my head about\u2026 I was thinking if we were going to be OK because the stranger was literally just outside the door of our classroom. And it was actually just our principal dressed in stranger clothes. I saw her wearing, like, a boy wig with her hair up in a bun. She had, like, a white shirt, a green tank top, and some, like, grayish blueish pants. I thought it was kind of scary because I didn\u2019t know who her true self was. So, we hid in the backroom or the closet. And it was very crowded, and we were very quiet.\n\nMargot, age 17.\n\n\u201cI remember it being a very weird shift from thinking about calculus to how I would escape if someone had a gun in my school.\u201d\n\nMargot\n\n12th grade\n\nTowson, Maryland\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

So the idea with ALICE is that it gives us more options. Basically what they\u2019re telling us is that we have permission and that we\u2019re encouraged to counter a shooter if given the opportunity. Countering always comes up. Some people have some fun with it because they\u2019re, like, \u201cOK, what can I throw at this person?\u201d And to some extent, it\u2019s kind of just being ridiculous because a water bottle isn\u2019t going to be a fair match against an AR-15. And we all kind of know that. But we\u2019re also being serious at the same time because it\u2019s kind of all we have.\n\n\u201cIf it happens\u2014a school shooting\u2014I could risk my life, and I don\u2019t want to do that, so I want to learn how to do it correctly.\u201d\n\nBrandon\n\nSeventh grade\n\nSan Diego\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

It\u2019s very unorganized, the drills. We were talking and then there was a moment of silence for a straight minute, and it was really creepy. I\u2019m thinking: Are we ever going to get up? Is the teacher ever going to say anything? After the drill at recess, I just didn\u2019t do anything, I just sat there and thought about everything. I thought there was going to be more action. We could have done a lot more than just sat there the whole time.\n\nColin, age 6.\n\n\u201cWe got to our places and got heavy things. \u2026 There\u2019s spheres and rectangles and triangles.

And the thing that I got was heavy blocks. There\u2019s like spheres and rectangles and triangles. So I got this sphere because that\u2019s the heaviest thing. But there\u2019s only three spheres. I got one, but the rest of the class got other shapes.

And we go: I\u2019d totally be able to this, that, and the other. But I think practically, knowing myself, I would be in abject terror, and it would almost be hard to get myself to do anything, much less heft a heavy object at someone trying to get in. If I had to rank on all this, of things I would be worried about in school, I think it would be: No. 1, getting a bad grade. No. 2, school shooter.\n\n\u201cBut then all the teachers tell you, \u2018You should have a worst-case scenario in your mind.\u2019 And I don\u2019t get why they do that.\u201d\n\nAlden\n\nSixth grade\n\nSeattle\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

At first I didn\u2019t get it, but now I\u2019ve heard all these stories, I sort of really get why they tell us to. When I heard about the first school shooting I\u2019m, like, wow that\u2019s why we do lockdown drills. We get the Seattle Times every morning, and it was on the front page of the Seattle Times, and I\u2019m pretty sure I asked my friends, and they told me that it\u2019s a very sad story. That\u2019s a reason to be afraid. But having a little drill is not a reason to be afraid.\n\nLucy, age 8.\n\n\u201cIf a real intruder came, I think since I\u2019m used to it now, I wouldn\u2019t be so scared by it.\u201d\n\nLucy\n\nSecond grade\n\nLouisville, Kentucky\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

And then we heard our principal tell us on the speaker there was an intruder drill. We heard someone bang on the door, like [knock, knock, knock]. I knew it was the principal at the time. It was a little scary because it was loud, and very dark in the room. And then it just stopped. Sometimes I worry about intruder drills, whenever it\u2019s done.

Like, every time I have a lockdown drill, I always am really scared by people talking and playing chopsticks or whatever. Because I always do the thing\u2014not in like a, \u201cOh, I always do the right thing\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to die. And I thought there was a significant possibility that I could. So I was, like, why is everyone playing games, what\u2019s going on here? Maybe this is a super common feeling or maybe nobody feels this way. It\u2019s hard to tell, because people don\u2019t talk about it much. That drill made me get mad at the school and everything. It really made me angry and sad and feel kind of trapped, because what am I supposed to do?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of thing I want to be thinking about.
