    "content": "U.S. Senate Chamber c.1873 ( Library of Congress ' Brady-Handy collection/Wikimedia Commons )\nAs President Trump \u2019 s impeachment leaves the House , the upper chamber needs to be what the Founders expected it to be .\nWe have spent the last several weeks intensely debating the Founders \u2019 view of impeachment . Now that the House has actually impeached the president , it \u2019 s time to pay attention to the Founders \u2019 view of the Senate .\nWe know that a Senate \u2019 s trial of impeachments is supposed to be more solemn and impartial than the House \u2019 s own impeachment proceedings . Alexander Hamilton stresses this in the now-famous Federalist No . 65 . Even House Democrats acknowledged this throughout their process ; Chairman Schiff , for example , compared the House \u2019 s role to that of a prosecutor \u2019 s grand jury , whose job is not to decide whether the accused is actually guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , but whether there is the bare minimum of evidence necessary to charge the accused with a crime . In impeachment , the House \u2019 s job is to bring accusations ; the Senate \u2019 s job is to sit in judgment of the House \u2019 s accusations and the official being accused . But how should the Senate actually carry out this constitutional responsibility ?\nIt may seem that the solemn business of an impeachment trial requires the Senate to reconstitute itself temporarily as a different kind of institution \u2014 not senators , but judges or jurors \u2014 and to conduct itself according to the norms of a court trial , with each member maintaining an open mind as to the facts and issues to be tried . But this takes the analogy to a courtroom too far .\nA Senate impeachment trial requires solemn judgment of a degree not often seen in modern Senates . But this tells us more about the modern Senate than it does about the Framers \u2019 expectations for senators .\nThe Framers did not commit impeachment trials to the Senate because they wanted the Senate to temporarily become a different kind of institution . They committed impeachment trials to the Senate because the Senate itself , as they originally envisioned it , was the institution best suited to carry out the extraordinary work of a such a trial . To carry out the job that the Constitution assigns to them , senators shouldn \u2019 t reconceive of themselves as courtroom jurors . They should recommit themselves to the Framers \u2019 original vision of their job in general .\nWhat does this mean in practice ? It means that we should not expect senators to carry out their work with the broad impartiality that we demand of jurors . Rather , the impartiality required of them is the quality of character that the Framers expected of them generally : impartial between the institutional interests of the energetic presidency and those of the impassioned House ; self-consciously removed from the political passions that inflame politics generally and that burn especially hot in impeachment ; well-apprised in advance of the matters at issue in the impeachment dispute , as they ought to be well-versed in all matters of government ; and dedicated affirmatively to the constitutional need for steady administration of our government even when the Trump administration , like all administrations , would strongly prefer that the Senate leave it alone .\nOur tendency to analogize senators to jurors , and the Senate to a court , is not accidental . The Constitution gives the Senate \u201c the sole Power to try all Impeachments , \u201d and the Framers \u2019 most eloquent explanation of the Senate \u2019 s impeachment power , Alexander Hamilton \u2019 s Federalist Nos . 65 and 66 , defended that provision by reference to the Senate \u2019 s \u201c judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments . \u201d\nWe must be careful , however , not to take the \u201c court \u201d metaphor too far . Senators do have a judicial character , but they remain senators . The Senate becomes the court in which impeachment is tried , and the senators undertake the trial \u201c on Oath or Affirmation , \u201d but this \u201c court \u201d is a political court of impeachment , not a judicial court of law . Most importantly , when Hamilton spoke of the Senate \u2019 s \u201c judicial character , \u201d he wasn \u2019 t describing what the Senate becomes on certain special occasions \u2014 he was describing what the Constitution needs of the Senate whenever the Senate does its work .\nAnd so I agree with The Bulwark \u2019 s Bill Kristol and Jeffrey Tulis that impeachment trials are the Senate \u2019 s \u201c awesome responsibility , \u201d obligating the senators to look beyond base partisanship and \u201c make this a moment that demonstrates our constitutional order at its best rather than politics at its worst. \u201d But I would not go so far as to say that impeachment transforms the Senate into \u201c a different institution. \u201d Instead , impeachment needs senators to be what the Framers meant them to be . The Constitution doesn \u2019 t need senators to become a court ; it needs them to become , genuinely , the Senate .\nThe most consequential word in American constitutionalism is \u201c administration \u201d \u2014 not \u201c the administration , \u201d as in the Trump administration or the Obama administration , but \u201c administration \u201d in the sense that the Framers understood it : namely , the actual functioning of government , the administering of the powers that the Constitution entrusts to the people \u2019 s representatives . As Hamilton explained in Federalist No . 72 , \u201c the administration of government , in its largest sense , comprehends all the operations of the body politic , whether legislative , executive , or judiciary . \u201d\n\u201c Administration \u201d is the most consequential word in American constitutionalism for two reasons .\nFirst , as Hamilton emphasized repeatedly in the Federalist , \u201c the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration. \u201d The Framers , aspiring to create a new Constitution that would replace the ineffectual Articles of Confederation , understood that the resulting document would be judged not by its theoretical elegance but by the fruits \u2014 the governance \u2014 that it actually produced .\nSecond , \u201c administration \u201d is consequential because of the way that we eventually reinterpreted the term . At some point , surely long ago , the American people came to identify \u201c administration \u201d exclusively with the executive branch . That change facilitated the misimpression of \u201c administration \u201d as something that the president does , while the other parts of government \u2014 representatives , senators , judges \u2014 are busy doing other things . This misunderstanding of the other institutions \u2019 own constitutional responsibilities profoundly affected the behavior of the courts , the House , and , especially , the Senate .\nTo be fair , our changed understanding of \u201c administration \u201d was not accidental . Hamilton recognized from the outset , in Federalist No . 72 , that \u201c administration \u201d includes first and foremost those activities that fall \u201c peculiarly within the province of the executive department. \u201d ( Just two Federalist papers earlier , Hamilton \u2019 s famous defense of executive power argued that energy in the executive would promote \u201c the steady administration of the laws. \u201d ) But Hamilton and his co-authors emphasized throughout their Federalist essays that the Constitution relied upon other parts of government to play significant roles in administration \u2014 and that the Senate \u2019 s contributions to administration would be among the most important of all .\nHamilton stressed this point in his discussion of the appointment of Cabinet officers , in Federalist No . 76 , recognizing that even good presidents would be tempted to staff the executive branch \u2019 s leadership badly , serving personal loyalty or political advantage rather than the public interest . Hamilton argued that the Senate \u2019 s power to grant or withhold its \u201c advice and consent \u201d to a presidential appointment \u201c would have a powerful , though in general , a silent operation , \u201d tending \u201c greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state prejudice , from family connexion , from personal attachment , or from a view to popularity. \u201d In that way , Hamilton stressed , the Senate \u201c would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration. \u201d Good administration required more than just a government of yes-men , people \u201c personally allied to \u201d the president and \u201c possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure. \u201d In domestic policy , good administration was not simply the province of the president ; it also required a strong investment of time and effort by a Senate of \u201c independent and public spirited men , \u201d who often would undertake their duty in spite of the president himself .\nSo too in foreign policy . In Federalist No . 64 , John Jay explained that the Senate \u2019 s constitutional power to grant or withhold its advice and consent from treaties reflected the Framers \u2019 understanding that our government \u2019 s commitments needed to be \u201c cautiously formed and steadily pursued \u201d by \u201c able and honest men \u201d with a real understanding of \u201c our national concerns. \u201d This duty would fall to senators , \u201c who have become the most distinguished by their abilities and virtue , and in whom the people perceive just grounds for confidence. \u201d And , as in domestic policy , it would require those senators to dedicate time and effort to shaping administration even when the president preferred otherwise .\nJay \u2019 s and Hamilton \u2019 s characterizations of the Senate \u2019 s necessary contributions to administration , and their accounts of the personal virtues necessary for senators to make those contributions , echoed James Madison \u2019 s own view of what the Senate would be and do . Describing the Senate \u2019 s role in Congress \u2019 s legislative process , Madison wrote in Federalist No . 63 that legislation needed to be directed by \u201c the cool and deliberate sense of the community , \u201d not by people stirred up by \u201c some irregular passion \u201d or by some artful politician \u2019 s \u201c illicit advantage. \u201d This is what would distinguish the Senate from the House : When the House was stirred up by political furies , the Senate would remain the \u201c temperate and respectable body of citizens , \u201d intervening \u201c to suspend the blow mediated by the people against themselves , until reason , justice , and truth , can regain their authority over the public mind . \u201d\nMore fundamentally , Madison described the Senate \u2019 s constitutional role , in Federalist No . 62 , with a striking phrase : \u201c the senatorial trust. \u201d Here , too , he was marking a contrast between the Senate and the House , one exemplified not just by senators \u2019 longer terms in office , but also by the higher age and citizenship requirements the Constitution placed on them as opposed to representatives . The Constitution required senators to be at least 30 years old , with at least nine years of citizenship , greater than representatives \u2019 25- and seven-year thresholds , because of \u201c the nature of the senatorial trust. \u201d The constitutional Senate is an institution \u201c requiring greater extent and stability of character , \u201d and thus its senators \u201c should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages . \u201d\nMadison also focused on the well-known difference between a senator \u2019 s term and a representative \u2019 s . A senator \u2019 s six-year term , longer than a representative \u2019 s two years or a president \u2019 s four , embodied \u201c the necessity of some stable institution in government \u201d to mitigate the risk that congressional elections every two years would bring about a constant flux in legislation and administration \u2014 something \u201c inconsistent with every rule of prudence , and every prospect of success. \u201d Here , Madison was focused squarely on the Senate \u2019 s contributions to good , steady administration . Constant flux in government personnel would cause flux in legislation and policy \u2014 \u201c the mischievous effects of a mutable government , \u201d paralyzing economic growth at home and undermining America \u2019 s stature abroad . \u201c No government , any more than an individual , will long be respected , without being truly respectable ; nor be truly respectable , without possessing a certain portion of order and stability , \u201d Madison wrote . Once again , the Senate \u2019 s contribution to good administration , and thus to the Constitution \u2019 s vision of good government , was the stability offered by a body of senators \u2014 namely , men ( and now women ) serving longer terms and , the Framers hoped , elected to those terms because of their superior character .\nIt is easy to read Madison \u2019 s centuries-old writings and chuckle at how far today \u2019 s Senate seems removed from Madison \u2019 s ideal . Today the only salient difference between senators and representatives is not the depth of their virtue but the length of their terms , and we \u2019 ve forgotten the whole reason for their longer terms ( and greater ages ) in the first place .\nBut if anything , it \u2019 s Hamilton \u2019 s and Jay \u2019 s accounts , focused on the administration of foreign and domestic policy , that seem ever more archaic . Senators are little interested in checking and guiding the administration of foreign policy nowadays , and even less interested in checking and guiding the administration of domestic policy through presidential appointments , unless the president is of the opposite party .\nThis has been a particular worrisome feature of the last three years , especially with respect to domestic administration . President Trump has staffed his agency leadership with astonishing numbers of \u201c acting \u201d officers lacking the Senate \u2019 s advice and consent . It \u2019 s no surprise , as Hamilton noted in Federalist No . 76 , that a president would prefer to avoid the Senate \u2019 s constitutional role . ( \u201c I like acting [ officials ] , \u201d Trump told reporters in January 2019 . \u201c It gives me more flexibility . Do you understand that ? I like acting [ officials ] . \u201d ) That natural preference is precisely why constitutional administration relies on the Senate to assert itself against presidential unilateralism . Yet Senate Republicans , understandably keen to continue their laudable success in confirming judges , consciously de-prioritized the Senate \u2019 s role in the appointment process , and thus de-prioritized the Senate \u2019 s role in ensuring good , stable constitutional administration . \u201c Priority between an assistant secretary of state and a conservative court judge \u2014 it \u2019 s not a hard choice to make , \u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told The Weekly Standard in 2017 .\nAs a matter of principle , it ought to be a hard choice , or at least a harder choice , to make . As Justice Thomas observed in a 2017 opinion , the Senate \u2019 s constitutional role in the appointment of administration personnel \u201c is not an empty formality , \u201d but rather a crucial protection against \u201c the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the Government. \u201d Yet senators \u2019 relative lack of interest in executive-branch appointments makes perfect sense if one remembers that they do not see themselves as responsible for the actual administration of government . In an era when the Senate thinks of administration as the president \u2019 s job , its near-exclusive focus on judicial appointments is not reasonable , but compelling .\nAnd so we ought to recall Hamilton \u2019 s key warning , in Federalist Nos . 68 and 76 : \u201c the true test of a good government \u201d is not its aptitude and tendency to produce good judges alone , but \u201c its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration \u201d altogether . And the other way for the Senate to ensure good administration \u2014 after legislation , treaties , and appointments \u2014 is impeachment .\nBut that brings us back to the original question : When the Senate is called upon to try an impeachment , how should it conceive of its work ?\nTo understand the Senate \u2019 s proper constitutional role in impeachment , we turn to Hamilton \u2019 s now-famous description of Senate impeachment trials in Federalist Nos . 65 and 66 . But as we read his description \u2014 like so many congressmen did , aloud , in the House \u2019 s closing debates on Trump \u2019 s impeachment \u2014 the great challenge to overcome if we are to understand the Senate \u2019 s proper role in an impeachment trial is our modern misunderstanding of the Senate in general .\nIf we compare Hamilton \u2019 s description of a Senate trial to our modern view of the Senate \u2019 s day-to-day business , a Senate impeachment trial seems vastly different ; it seems to call upon the senators to become something greater than just senators . But if we compare Hamilton \u2019 s description of a Senate trial to the Founders \u2019 original view of the Senate \u2019 s day-to-day business , the gulf shrinks significantly . And for good reason : The whole point of committing impeachment trials to the Senate was not that senators would then reconceive themselves as judges or jurors , but rather that senators would already be men of a judicial temperament , with deep investment in the quality and stability of administration . In trying impeachments , genuine senators would already be well-suited to the task at hand .\nIndeed , when we focus squarely on the task of impeachment itself , strict analogies to judges and juries quickly prove inapt . After all , if the Framers wanted impeachments to be tried by something equivalent to a court , they would have had an option much better than senators available to them : actual judges , such as the members of the Supreme Court . In fact , the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 actually considered committing impeachment trials to the Supreme Court . But they declined to do so , for a variety of reasons . For one thing , they were concerned that Supreme Court justices would be too beholden to a president who \u2019 d appointed them , or that justices \u201c were too few in number and might be warped or corrupted . \u201d\nFor another , the substance of impeachment was a matter that called not for a judge \u2019 s judgment but a senator \u2019 s . As Hamilton observed in Federalist No . 65 , the model for impeachment trials was not a court , but Great Britain \u2019 s House of Lords .\nThis institutional choice reflected impeachment \u2019 s substance . At the Convention , the delegates deliberately defined impeachment not simply in narrow terms of \u201c treason \u201d and \u201c bribery \u201d because they wanted impeachment to cover ( in George Mason \u2019 s words ) \u201c many great and dangerous offences \u201d that might not qualify strictly as crimes . They rejected impeachment for \u201c maladministration , \u201d because ( as Madison put it ) it would be a threshold so low that the president would in effect hold his office merely at the \u201c pleasure of the Senate. \u201d They settled instead upon a familiar but still vague term of English practice , \u201c high Crimes and Misdemeanors . \u201d\nIn Federalist No . 65 , Hamilton emphasized that this constitutional provision framed impeachment in terms of offenses best \u201c denominated political , as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. \u201d An impeachment proceeding would thus be one that could \u201c never be tied down by such strict rules \u201d ; in substance , the Constitution \u2019 s provision for impeachment was inherently unfit for \u201c the construction of it by the judges. \u201d In a courtroom trial , judges are bound by rules and juries that \u201c limit the discretion of courts \u201d ; in an impeachment trial , by contrast , the trier would \u201c necessarily have \u201d an \u201c awful discretion. \u201d An impeachment trial would require not a judge or a jury , but a different kind of decisionmaker \u2014 a body of statesmen who would wield such \u201c awful discretion \u201d wisely , with a proper understanding of the public interest . Which is to say , the Founders \u2019 vision of the Senate .\nOf course , one real judge does participate in impeachment trials : the chief justice of the Supreme Court , who presides when the president is the one being impeached . The chief justice \u2019 s involvement might suggest that a Senate impeachment trial is quasi-judicial , transforming the Senate into an inherently different institution . But this ignores the fact that in most Senate impeachment trials \u2014 i.e. , all impeachments involving a judge or federal official other than the president \u2014 the chief justice is not involved . The nature of impeachment trials is not defined by his involvement , because he is not an inherent part of such trials .\nIn fact , the chief justice \u2019 s participation in presidential impeachment trials is quite possibly a red herring . Madison \u2019 s notes from the Constitutional Convention do not explain why the Framers included the chief justice only in presidential impeachments . But there seems a rather simple explanation for it : In presidential impeachments , the man presiding over the Senate \u2014 namely , the vice president \u2014 would have an obvious conflict of interest . A presidential impeachment would require a different officer , and the chief justice was a reasonable choice . In this view , his presence was a pragmatic accommodation , not a hint of impeachment \u2019 s fundamental nature .\nStill , Hamilton \u2019 s account of impeachment did emphasize the necessary \u201c independence \u201d of senators , and so we must grapple with what that independence entails . Here , too , however , Hamilton \u2019 s full explanation points to something far less sweeping than the independence and impartiality of judges and juries , who must be independent from politics , and impartial as to the facts that they will hear in the case . On independence , Hamilton wrote in Federalist No . 65 :\nWhere else , than in the senate , could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified , or sufficiently independent ? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation , to preserve , unawed and uninfluenced , the necessary impartiality between an individual accused , and the representatives of the people , his accusers ? [ Emphasis added . ]\nHamilton \u2019 s point is clear : An impeachment trial needs to be decided by an institution that does not have an inherent bias for or against either the House or the official being impeached . The Senate served this role , because there is no reason why the Senate would have such an institutional bias .\nAnd even if Hamilton were thinking of impartiality not in terms of the perennial structure of the Senate as an institution , but rather in terms of the partiality that senators might have at a given moment in time toward either the president or the representatives impeaching him , the impartiality necessary for a Senate impeachment trial would fall far short of what we expect of a judge or jury . In a court of law , we expect judges and juries to come to the trial without preconceived views of the facts at issue ; we expect them to keep their minds open and to decide the case based on the evidence presented in court . But for impeachment , Hamilton offers no hint that the decisionmaker must approach the case with such a completely open mind as to the facts at issue .\nIndeed , it would strain credulity to expect that degree of sweeping independence and impartiality , especially when Hamilton himself describes \u201c the true spirit \u201d of impeachment as \u201c a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men. \u201d Impeachment trials deal with those matters about which senators , deeply invested in the work of government and knowledgeable about affairs of the state , would almost certainly have preconceived notions .\nInstead , the impartiality that Hamilton describes in Federalist No . 65 is of a piece with the character that , as described above , the Framers intended for senators to bring to all of their institutional responsibilities . When Hamilton warns that impeachments \u201c will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community , \u201d dividing the public into pro- and anti- contingents mapping easily on to \u201c the pre-existing factions \u201d of a political moment and triggering all the same \u201c animosities , partialities , influence , and interest , \u201d he is telling us that impeachment will look like . . . normal , impassioned politics , only hotter . For Hamilton and his fellow Framers , the passions raised by impeachments were the same passions raised by virtually all aspects of republican government . In impeachment , the passions would be mitigated by the same institution that would help to mitigate them in politics generally : the Senate , for all of the structural and attitudinal reasons described above .\nAny lingering ambiguity is dispelled when Hamilton returns to the issue of impeachment one last time , at the end of Federalist No . 77 . Concluding his multiple-essay discussion of executive power , Hamilton ends with a reassurance that if the president were to abuse his office , the people would be protected not by a quasi-judicial Senate , but by \u201c the legislative body . \u201d\nOne genuine distinction between the senators \u2019 work in impeachment and their work on other matters is their oath . Article I , Section 3 , Clause 6 of the Constitution specifies a special oath for impeachment trials : \u201c When sitting for that purpose [ i.e. , trying impeachments ] , they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. \u201d The Constitution already requires senators ( and representatives , and state legislators , and \u201c all executive or judicial Officers \u201d ) to \u201c be bound by Oath or Affirmation \u201d in general , though it does not specify the oath \u2019 s content . ( The first Congress , in the first bill it passed into law , wrote the oath in the broadest possible terms : \u201c I do solemnly swear . . . that I will support the Constitution of the United States. \u201d ) What more could the Senate \u2019 s impeachment-oath requirement entail ?\nThe best answer might be the simplest one . By specifying that the senators swear an oath without specifying the content of that oath , the Framers intended for the oath to spur senators , with special solemnity , to do what they were always expected to do as senators .\nThis is what Gouverneur Morris seemed to have in mind when he proposed the oath requirement at the Constitutional Convention . Facing James Madison \u2019 s original skepticism of vesting the Senate with the power to try impeachments , Morris replied , according to Madison \u2019 s notes , that although the Constitution must avoid the danger of subjecting the presidency to micromanagement by Congress , \u201c there could be no danger that the Senate would say untruly on their oaths that the President was guilty of crimes or facts \u201d ( emphasis added ) . After the delegates voted to commit impeachment trials to the Senate , Morris offered a specific amendment adding that in a Senate trial \u201c every member shall be on oath , \u201d and the delegates adopted it .\nTo sum all of this up : The Framers committed impeachment trials to the Senate , not to the Supreme Court , because they were a task appropriate for senators , not justices . In doing so , the Framers expected senators to be \u201c sufficiently independent \u201d from both the official being impeached and the House doing the impeaching , and \u201c sufficiently dignified \u201d to carry out such a momentous task in the midst of inevitably momentous political passion . Yet this is less a description of the Senate \u2019 s particular role in impeachment than a description of the Senate \u2019 s role in governance generally . By inserting the chief justice into presidential impeachments , the Framers did not suggest that they intended for one judge to turn 100 senators into 100 judges ; more likely , they simply needed one judge to temporarily replace the one Senate official ( i.e. , the vice president ) with a particular conflict of interest in such impeachments . And the Framers obligated senators to swear an oath in impeachment not to change them into something other than senators , but to inspire them to be the best version of themselves in an impeachment trial .\nAs Hamilton put it , in Federalist No . 77 \u2019 s closing lines on impeachment , \u201c What more can an enlightened and reasonable people desire ? \u201d\nThe Senate now faces the awesome responsibility of trying the impeachment of the United States \u2019 45th president , and senators are surely wondering what that responsibility entails . If they have read this far , past 3,000 words of Framers \u2019 wisdom and this author \u2019 s platitudes , then I hope they have a clearer idea of the answer : They need to be senators , in the truest and best sense of that constitutional institution \u2014 selected with the hope that they would exhibit the character and temperament of genuine statesmen ; vested with six-year terms intended to bolster their fortitude against the people \u2019 s political passions ; and empowered to invest themselves deeply in their work to produce the good administration that would demonstrate the goodness of the Constitution itself . To the extent that we find it hard to imagine senators living up to this standard in President Trump \u2019 s impeachment trial , it is because we long ago lost sight of what the Senate was supposed to be in the first place . This is our failure , not the Framers \u2019 .\nThe preemptive declarations of Senators McConnell and Graham that they will not be \u201c impartial jurors \u201d is an ominous sign that we are embarking on something far short of what the Constitution intended . Let \u2019 s hope that the gravity of the moment , before the judgment of history , spurs all senators to take their oath with the integrity that any oath demands . At the same time , as Ramesh Ponnuru notes , we should all take care not to misconstrue the kind of \u201c impartial justice \u201d that a Senate impeachment trial genuinely entails .\nBut even if McConnell , Graham , or other Republican or Democratic senators fail to live up to their oath , surely other senators will live up to theirs . If this presidential impeachment trial inspires enough senators to vindicate the Framers \u2019 expectations for their institution , and if that in turn helps Americans to begin to rediscover the Senate \u2019 s proper and necessary role in American government , then perhaps the last few years \u2019 political nightmare will someday be worth its immense cost .",
    "content_original": "U.S. Senate Chamber c.1873 (Library of Congress' Brady-Handy collection/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAs President Trump\u2019s impeachment leaves the House, the upper chamber needs to be what the Founders expected it to be.\n\nWe have spent the last several weeks intensely debating the Founders\u2019 view of impeachment. Now that the House has actually impeached the president, it\u2019s time to pay attention to the Founders\u2019 view of the Senate.\n\nWe know that a Senate\u2019s trial of impeachments is supposed to be more solemn and impartial than the House\u2019s own impeachment proceedings. Alexander Hamilton stresses this in the now-famous Federalist No. 65. Even House Democrats acknowledged this throughout their process; Chairman Schiff, for example, compared the House\u2019s role to that of a prosecutor\u2019s grand jury, whose job is not to decide whether the accused is actually guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there is the bare minimum of evidence necessary to charge the accused with a crime. In impeachment, the House\u2019s job is to bring accusations; the Senate\u2019s job is to sit in judgment of the House\u2019s accusations and the official being accused. But how should the Senate actually carry out this constitutional responsibility?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may seem that the solemn business of an impeachment trial requires the Senate to reconstitute itself temporarily as a different kind of institution \u2014 not senators, but judges or jurors \u2014 and to conduct itself according to the norms of a court trial, with each member maintaining an open mind as to the facts and issues to be tried. But this takes the analogy to a courtroom too far.\n\nA Senate impeachment trial requires solemn judgment of a degree not often seen in modern Senates. But this tells us more about the modern Senate than it does about the Framers\u2019 expectations for senators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Framers did not commit impeachment trials to the Senate because they wanted the Senate to temporarily become a different kind of institution. They committed impeachment trials to the Senate because the Senate itself, as they originally envisioned it, was the institution best suited to carry out the extraordinary work of a such a trial. To carry out the job that the Constitution assigns to them, senators shouldn\u2019t reconceive of themselves as courtroom jurors. They should recommit themselves to the Framers\u2019 original vision of their job in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? It means that we should not expect senators to carry out their work with the broad impartiality that we demand of jurors. Rather, the impartiality required of them is the quality of character that the Framers expected of them generally: impartial between the institutional interests of the energetic presidency and those of the impassioned House; self-consciously removed from the political passions that inflame politics generally and that burn especially hot in impeachment; well-apprised in advance of the matters at issue in the impeachment dispute, as they ought to be well-versed in all matters of government; and dedicated affirmatively to the constitutional need for steady administration of our government even when the Trump administration, like all administrations, would strongly prefer that the Senate leave it alone.\n\nThe Senate as a Court?\n\nOur tendency to analogize senators to jurors, and the Senate to a court, is not accidental. The Constitution gives the Senate \u201cthe sole Power to try all Impeachments,\u201d and the Framers\u2019 most eloquent explanation of the Senate\u2019s impeachment power, Alexander Hamilton\u2019s Federalist Nos. 65 and 66, defended that provision by reference to the Senate\u2019s \u201cjudicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments.\u201d\n\nWe must be careful, however, not to take the \u201ccourt\u201d metaphor too far. Senators do have a judicial character, but they remain senators. The Senate becomes the court in which impeachment is tried, and the senators undertake the trial \u201con Oath or Affirmation,\u201d but this \u201ccourt\u201d is a political court of impeachment, not a judicial court of law. Most importantly, when Hamilton spoke of the Senate\u2019s \u201cjudicial character,\u201d he wasn\u2019t describing what the Senate becomes on certain special occasions \u2014 he was describing what the Constitution needs of the Senate whenever the Senate does its work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so I agree with The Bulwark\u2019s Bill Kristol and Jeffrey Tulis that impeachment trials are the Senate\u2019s \u201cawesome responsibility,\u201d obligating the senators to look beyond base partisanship and \u201cmake this a moment that demonstrates our constitutional order at its best rather than politics at its worst.\u201d But I would not go so far as to say that impeachment transforms the Senate into \u201ca different institution.\u201d Instead, impeachment needs senators to be what the Framers meant them to be. The Constitution doesn\u2019t need senators to become a court; it needs them to become, genuinely, the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe True Test of a Good Government\u201d\n\nThe most consequential word in American constitutionalism is \u201cadministration\u201d \u2014 not \u201cthe administration,\u201d as in the Trump administration or the Obama administration, but \u201cadministration\u201d in the sense that the Framers understood it: namely, the actual functioning of government, the administering of the powers that the Constitution entrusts to the people\u2019s representatives. As Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 72, \u201cthe administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive, or judiciary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAdministration\u201d is the most consequential word in American constitutionalism for two reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, as Hamilton emphasized repeatedly in the Federalist, \u201cthe true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.\u201d The Framers, aspiring to create a new Constitution that would replace the ineffectual Articles of Confederation, understood that the resulting document would be judged not by its theoretical elegance but by the fruits \u2014 the governance \u2014 that it actually produced.\n\nSecond, \u201cadministration\u201d is consequential because of the way that we eventually reinterpreted the term. At some point, surely long ago, the American people came to identify \u201cadministration\u201d exclusively with the executive branch. That change facilitated the misimpression of \u201cadministration\u201d as something that the president does, while the other parts of government \u2014 representatives, senators, judges \u2014 are busy doing other things. This misunderstanding of the other institutions\u2019 own constitutional responsibilities profoundly affected the behavior of the courts, the House, and, especially, the Senate.\n\nTo be fair, our changed understanding of \u201cadministration\u201d was not accidental. Hamilton recognized from the outset, in Federalist No. 72, that \u201cadministration\u201d includes first and foremost those activities that fall \u201cpeculiarly within the province of the executive department.\u201d (Just two Federalist papers earlier, Hamilton\u2019s famous defense of executive power argued that energy in the executive would promote \u201cthe steady administration of the laws.\u201d) But Hamilton and his co-authors emphasized throughout their Federalist essays that the Constitution relied upon other parts of government to play significant roles in administration \u2014 and that the Senate\u2019s contributions to administration would be among the most important of all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamilton stressed this point in his discussion of the appointment of Cabinet officers, in Federalist No. 76, recognizing that even good presidents would be tempted to staff the executive branch\u2019s leadership badly, serving personal loyalty or political advantage rather than the public interest. Hamilton argued that the Senate\u2019s power to grant or withhold its \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to a presidential appointment \u201cwould have a powerful, though in general, a silent operation,\u201d tending \u201cgreatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state prejudice, from family connexion, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.\u201d In that way, Hamilton stressed, the Senate \u201cwould be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.\u201d Good administration required more than just a government of yes-men, people \u201cpersonally allied to\u201d the president and \u201cpossessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.\u201d In domestic policy, good administration was not simply the province of the president; it also required a strong investment of time and effort by a Senate of \u201cindependent and public spirited men,\u201d who often would undertake their duty in spite of the president himself.\n\nSo too in foreign policy. In Federalist No. 64, John Jay explained that the Senate\u2019s constitutional power to grant or withhold its advice and consent from treaties reflected the Framers\u2019 understanding that our government\u2019s commitments needed to be \u201ccautiously formed and steadily pursued\u201d by \u201cable and honest men\u201d with a real understanding of \u201cour national concerns.\u201d This duty would fall to senators, \u201cwho have become the most distinguished by their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive just grounds for confidence.\u201d And, as in domestic policy, it would require those senators to dedicate time and effort to shaping administration even when the president preferred otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJay\u2019s and Hamilton\u2019s characterizations of the Senate\u2019s necessary contributions to administration, and their accounts of the personal virtues necessary for senators to make those contributions, echoed James Madison\u2019s own view of what the Senate would be and do. Describing the Senate\u2019s role in Congress\u2019s legislative process, Madison wrote in Federalist No. 63 that legislation needed to be directed by \u201cthe cool and deliberate sense of the community,\u201d not by people stirred up by \u201csome irregular passion\u201d or by some artful politician\u2019s \u201cillicit advantage.\u201d This is what would distinguish the Senate from the House: When the House was stirred up by political furies, the Senate would remain the \u201ctemperate and respectable body of citizens,\u201d intervening \u201cto suspend the blow mediated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth, can regain their authority over the public mind.\u201d\n\nMore fundamentally, Madison described the Senate\u2019s constitutional role, in Federalist No. 62, with a striking phrase: \u201cthe senatorial trust.\u201d Here, too, he was marking a contrast between the Senate and the House, one exemplified not just by senators\u2019 longer terms in office, but also by the higher age and citizenship requirements the Constitution placed on them as opposed to representatives. The Constitution required senators to be at least 30 years old, with at least nine years of citizenship, greater than representatives\u2019 25- and seven-year thresholds, because of \u201cthe nature of the senatorial trust.\u201d The constitutional Senate is an institution \u201crequiring greater extent and stability of character,\u201d and thus its senators \u201cshould have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages.\u201d\n\nMadison also focused on the well-known difference between a senator\u2019s term and a representative\u2019s. A senator\u2019s six-year term, longer than a representative\u2019s two years or a president\u2019s four, embodied \u201cthe necessity of some stable institution in government\u201d to mitigate the risk that congressional elections every two years would bring about a constant flux in legislation and administration \u2014 something \u201cinconsistent with every rule of prudence, and every prospect of success.\u201d Here, Madison was focused squarely on the Senate\u2019s contributions to good, steady administration. Constant flux in government personnel would cause flux in legislation and policy \u2014 \u201cthe mischievous effects of a mutable government,\u201d paralyzing economic growth at home and undermining America\u2019s stature abroad. \u201cNo government, any more than an individual, will long be respected, without being truly respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a certain portion of order and stability,\u201d Madison wrote. Once again, the Senate\u2019s contribution to good administration, and thus to the Constitution\u2019s vision of good government, was the stability offered by a body of senators \u2014 namely, men (and now women) serving longer terms and, the Framers hoped, elected to those terms because of their superior character.\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nIt is easy to read Madison\u2019s centuries-old writings and chuckle at how far today\u2019s Senate seems removed from Madison\u2019s ideal. Today the only salient difference between senators and representatives is not the depth of their virtue but the length of their terms, and we\u2019ve forgotten the whole reason for their longer terms (and greater ages) in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if anything, it\u2019s Hamilton\u2019s and Jay\u2019s accounts, focused on the administration of foreign and domestic policy, that seem ever more archaic. Senators are little interested in checking and guiding the administration of foreign policy nowadays, and even less interested in checking and guiding the administration of domestic policy through presidential appointments, unless the president is of the opposite party.\n\nThis has been a particular worrisome feature of the last three years, especially with respect to domestic administration. President Trump has staffed his agency leadership with astonishing numbers of \u201cacting\u201d officers lacking the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. It\u2019s no surprise, as Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 76, that a president would prefer to avoid the Senate\u2019s constitutional role. (\u201cI like acting [officials],\u201d Trump told reporters in January 2019. \u201cIt gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting [officials].\u201d) That natural preference is precisely why constitutional administration relies on the Senate to assert itself against presidential unilateralism. Yet Senate Republicans, understandably keen to continue their laudable success in confirming judges, consciously de-prioritized the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment process, and thus de-prioritized the Senate\u2019s role in ensuring good, stable constitutional administration. \u201cPriority between an assistant secretary of state and a conservative court judge \u2014 it\u2019s not a hard choice to make,\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told The Weekly Standard in 2017.\n\nAs a matter of principle, it ought to be a hard choice, or at least a harder choice, to make. As Justice Thomas observed in a 2017 opinion, the Senate\u2019s constitutional role in the appointment of administration personnel \u201cis not an empty formality,\u201d but rather a crucial protection against \u201cthe serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the Government.\u201d Yet senators\u2019 relative lack of interest in executive-branch appointments makes perfect sense if one remembers that they do not see themselves as responsible for the actual administration of government. In an era when the Senate thinks of administration as the president\u2019s job, its near-exclusive focus on judicial appointments is not reasonable, but compelling.\n\nAnd so we ought to recall Hamilton\u2019s key warning, in Federalist Nos. 68 and 76: \u201cthe true test of a good government\u201d is not its aptitude and tendency to produce good judges alone, but \u201cits aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration\u201d altogether. And the other way for the Senate to ensure good administration \u2014 after legislation, treaties, and appointments \u2014 is impeachment.\n\nBut that brings us back to the original question: When the Senate is called upon to try an impeachment, how should it conceive of its work?\n\n\u201cSufficiently Dignified\u201d and \u201cSufficiently Independent\u201d\n\nTo understand the Senate\u2019s proper constitutional role in impeachment, we turn to Hamilton\u2019s now-famous description of Senate impeachment trials in Federalist Nos. 65 and 66. But as we read his description \u2014 like so many congressmen did, aloud, in the House\u2019s closing debates on Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 the great challenge to overcome if we are to understand the Senate\u2019s proper role in an impeachment trial is our modern misunderstanding of the Senate in general.\n\nIf we compare Hamilton\u2019s description of a Senate trial to our modern view of the Senate\u2019s day-to-day business, a Senate impeachment trial seems vastly different; it seems to call upon the senators to become something greater than just senators. But if we compare Hamilton\u2019s description of a Senate trial to the Founders\u2019 original view of the Senate\u2019s day-to-day business, the gulf shrinks significantly. And for good reason: The whole point of committing impeachment trials to the Senate was not that senators would then reconceive themselves as judges or jurors, but rather that senators would already be men of a judicial temperament, with deep investment in the quality and stability of administration. In trying impeachments, genuine senators would already be well-suited to the task at hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, when we focus squarely on the task of impeachment itself, strict analogies to judges and juries quickly prove inapt. After all, if the Framers wanted impeachments to be tried by something equivalent to a court, they would have had an option much better than senators available to them: actual judges, such as the members of the Supreme Court. In fact, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 actually considered committing impeachment trials to the Supreme Court. But they declined to do so, for a variety of reasons. For one thing, they were concerned that Supreme Court justices would be too beholden to a president who\u2019d appointed them, or that justices \u201cwere too few in number and might be warped or corrupted.\u201d\n\nFor another, the substance of impeachment was a matter that called not for a judge\u2019s judgment but a senator\u2019s. As Hamilton observed in Federalist No. 65, the model for impeachment trials was not a court, but Great Britain\u2019s House of Lords.\n\nThis institutional choice reflected impeachment\u2019s substance. At the Convention, the delegates deliberately defined impeachment not simply in narrow terms of \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cbribery\u201d because they wanted impeachment to cover (in George Mason\u2019s words) \u201cmany great and dangerous offences\u201d that might not qualify strictly as crimes. They rejected impeachment for \u201cmaladministration,\u201d because (as Madison put it) it would be a threshold so low that the president would in effect hold his office merely at the \u201cpleasure of the Senate.\u201d They settled instead upon a familiar but still vague term of English practice, \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nIn Federalist No. 65, Hamilton emphasized that this constitutional provision framed impeachment in terms of offenses best \u201cdenominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d An impeachment proceeding would thus be one that could \u201cnever be tied down by such strict rules\u201d; in substance, the Constitution\u2019s provision for impeachment was inherently unfit for \u201cthe construction of it by the judges.\u201d In a courtroom trial, judges are bound by rules and juries that \u201climit the discretion of courts\u201d; in an impeachment trial, by contrast, the trier would \u201cnecessarily have\u201d an \u201cawful discretion.\u201d An impeachment trial would require not a judge or a jury, but a different kind of decisionmaker \u2014 a body of statesmen who would wield such \u201cawful discretion\u201d wisely, with a proper understanding of the public interest. Which is to say, the Founders\u2019 vision of the Senate.\n\nOf course, one real judge does participate in impeachment trials: the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who presides when the president is the one being impeached. The chief justice\u2019s involvement might suggest that a Senate impeachment trial is quasi-judicial, transforming the Senate into an inherently different institution. But this ignores the fact that in most Senate impeachment trials \u2014 i.e., all impeachments involving a judge or federal official other than the president \u2014 the chief justice is not involved. The nature of impeachment trials is not defined by his involvement, because he is not an inherent part of such trials.\n\nIn fact, the chief justice\u2019s participation in presidential impeachment trials is quite possibly a red herring. Madison\u2019s notes from the Constitutional Convention do not explain why the Framers included the chief justice only in presidential impeachments. But there seems a rather simple explanation for it: In presidential impeachments, the man presiding over the Senate \u2014 namely, the vice president \u2014 would have an obvious conflict of interest. A presidential impeachment would require a different officer, and the chief justice was a reasonable choice. In this view, his presence was a pragmatic accommodation, not a hint of impeachment\u2019s fundamental nature.\n\nStill, Hamilton\u2019s account of impeachment did emphasize the necessary \u201cindependence\u201d of senators, and so we must grapple with what that independence entails. Here, too, however, Hamilton\u2019s full explanation points to something far less sweeping than the independence and impartiality of judges and juries, who must be independent from politics, and impartial as to the facts that they will hear in the case. On independence, Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65:\n\nWhere else, than in the senate, could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers? [Emphasis added.]\n\nHamilton\u2019s point is clear: An impeachment trial needs to be decided by an institution that does not have an inherent bias for or against either the House or the official being impeached. The Senate served this role, because there is no reason why the Senate would have such an institutional bias.\n\nAnd even if Hamilton were thinking of impartiality not in terms of the perennial structure of the Senate as an institution, but rather in terms of the partiality that senators might have at a given moment in time toward either the president or the representatives impeaching him, the impartiality necessary for a Senate impeachment trial would fall far short of what we expect of a judge or jury. In a court of law, we expect judges and juries to come to the trial without preconceived views of the facts at issue; we expect them to keep their minds open and to decide the case based on the evidence presented in court. But for impeachment, Hamilton offers no hint that the decisionmaker must approach the case with such a completely open mind as to the facts at issue.\n\nIndeed, it would strain credulity to expect that degree of sweeping independence and impartiality, especially when Hamilton himself describes \u201cthe true spirit\u201d of impeachment as \u201ca method of national inquest into the conduct of public men.\u201d Impeachment trials deal with those matters about which senators, deeply invested in the work of government and knowledgeable about affairs of the state, would almost certainly have preconceived notions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the impartiality that Hamilton describes in Federalist No. 65 is of a piece with the character that, as described above, the Framers intended for senators to bring to all of their institutional responsibilities. When Hamilton warns that impeachments \u201cwill seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community,\u201d dividing the public into pro- and anti- contingents mapping easily on to \u201cthe pre-existing factions\u201d of a political moment and triggering all the same \u201canimosities, partialities, influence, and interest,\u201d he is telling us that impeachment will look like . . . normal, impassioned politics, only hotter. For Hamilton and his fellow Framers, the passions raised by impeachments were the same passions raised by virtually all aspects of republican government. In impeachment, the passions would be mitigated by the same institution that would help to mitigate them in politics generally: the Senate, for all of the structural and attitudinal reasons described above.\n\nAny lingering ambiguity is dispelled when Hamilton returns to the issue of impeachment one last time, at the end of Federalist No. 77. Concluding his multiple-essay discussion of executive power, Hamilton ends with a reassurance that if the president were to abuse his office, the people would be protected not by a quasi-judicial Senate, but by \u201cthe legislative body.\u201d\n\nOne genuine distinction between the senators\u2019 work in impeachment and their work on other matters is their oath. Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the Constitution specifies a special oath for impeachment trials: \u201cWhen sitting for that purpose [i.e., trying impeachments], they shall be on Oath or Affirmation.\u201d The Constitution already requires senators (and representatives, and state legislators, and \u201call executive or judicial Officers\u201d) to \u201cbe bound by Oath or Affirmation\u201d in general, though it does not specify the oath\u2019s content. (The first Congress, in the first bill it passed into law, wrote the oath in the broadest possible terms: \u201cI do solemnly swear . . . that I will support the Constitution of the United States.\u201d) What more could the Senate\u2019s impeachment-oath requirement entail?\n\nThe best answer might be the simplest one. By specifying that the senators swear an oath without specifying the content of that oath, the Framers intended for the oath to spur senators, with special solemnity, to do what they were always expected to do as senators.\n\nThis is what Gouverneur Morris seemed to have in mind when he proposed the oath requirement at the Constitutional Convention. Facing James Madison\u2019s original skepticism of vesting the Senate with the power to try impeachments, Morris replied, according to Madison\u2019s notes, that although the Constitution must avoid the danger of subjecting the presidency to micromanagement by Congress, \u201cthere could be no danger that the Senate would say untruly on their oaths that the President was guilty of crimes or facts\u201d (emphasis added). After the delegates voted to commit impeachment trials to the Senate, Morris offered a specific amendment adding that in a Senate trial \u201cevery member shall be on oath,\u201d and the delegates adopted it.\n\nTo sum all of this up: The Framers committed impeachment trials to the Senate, not to the Supreme Court, because they were a task appropriate for senators, not justices. In doing so, the Framers expected senators to be \u201csufficiently independent\u201d from both the official being impeached and the House doing the impeaching, and \u201csufficiently dignified\u201d to carry out such a momentous task in the midst of inevitably momentous political passion. Yet this is less a description of the Senate\u2019s particular role in impeachment than a description of the Senate\u2019s role in governance generally. By inserting the chief justice into presidential impeachments, the Framers did not suggest that they intended for one judge to turn 100 senators into 100 judges; more likely, they simply needed one judge to temporarily replace the one Senate official (i.e., the vice president) with a particular conflict of interest in such impeachments. And the Framers obligated senators to swear an oath in impeachment not to change them into something other than senators, but to inspire them to be the best version of themselves in an impeachment trial.\n\nAs Hamilton put it, in Federalist No. 77\u2019s closing lines on impeachment, \u201cWhat more can an enlightened and reasonable people desire?\u201d\n\nAll Eyes on the Upper Chamber\n\nThe Senate now faces the awesome responsibility of trying the impeachment of the United States\u2019 45th president, and senators are surely wondering what that responsibility entails. If they have read this far, past 3,000 words of Framers\u2019 wisdom and this author\u2019s platitudes, then I hope they have a clearer idea of the answer: They need to be senators, in the truest and best sense of that constitutional institution \u2014 selected with the hope that they would exhibit the character and temperament of genuine statesmen; vested with six-year terms intended to bolster their fortitude against the people\u2019s political passions; and empowered to invest themselves deeply in their work to produce the good administration that would demonstrate the goodness of the Constitution itself. To the extent that we find it hard to imagine senators living up to this standard in President Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, it is because we long ago lost sight of what the Senate was supposed to be in the first place. This is our failure, not the Framers\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preemptive declarations of Senators McConnell and Graham that they will not be \u201cimpartial jurors\u201d is an ominous sign that we are embarking on something far short of what the Constitution intended. Let\u2019s hope that the gravity of the moment, before the judgment of history, spurs all senators to take their oath with the integrity that any oath demands. At the same time, as Ramesh Ponnuru notes, we should all take care not to misconstrue the kind of \u201cimpartial justice\u201d that a Senate impeachment trial genuinely entails.\n\nBut even if McConnell, Graham, or other Republican or Democratic senators fail to live up to their oath, surely other senators will live up to theirs. If this presidential impeachment trial inspires enough senators to vindicate the Framers\u2019 expectations for their institution, and if that in turn helps Americans to begin to rediscover the Senate\u2019s proper and necessary role in American government, then perhaps the last few years\u2019 political nightmare will someday be worth its immense cost.",
