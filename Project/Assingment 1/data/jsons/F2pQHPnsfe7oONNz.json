    "content": "The left-wing mob is recharged and totally insane . They \u2019 re back on this cancel culture nonsense . They \u2019 re tearing down statues of historical figures they view as problematic . There is no reasoning with them . They \u2019 re the intellectual al-Qaeda of our time . You don \u2019 t negotiate with terrorists . As Lincoln , Washington , Jefferson , and Roosevelt are being targeted , two things are clear . This has never been about Confederate statues , folks . This has been centered on the Left \u2019 s hatred of America and its history and the bizarre fetish to rewrite it through a woke paradigm where no nuance is afforded to anyone . The far-left loony code of ethics , for lack of a better term , is retroactively applied here . It \u2019 s utterly insane .\nNow , granted , I admit that the Left had a good PR move here . The Confederacy isn \u2019 t all that popular , of course . By targeting them , they \u2019 ve created a campaign that puts every historical figure at risk . It was never going to stop with Jackson , Lee , or Davis . Never . This was the flank march , the backdoor maneuver to smash all the people .\nAs you already know , the statue of former President Ulysses S. Grant was torn down . American history has dark periods . The Confederacy , for better or worse , is part of that narrative . It must be defended , so yes\u2014I will defend all the statues because the alternative is what we \u2019 re seeing now : A roving band of historically illiterate morons whose main goal is destruction and nothing else .\nConservative commentator Jesse Kelly has decided to bring the war home for these clowns , compiling a list of institutions that should be canceled due to the Left \u2019 s new rules on this matter . If you \u2019 re a member of the liberal elite , you should be ashamed . The entire Ivy League was built on racism . Granted , some of you knew this already . New York City was named after James , the Duke of York , and eventual King of England ( James II ) , who , along with his brother , King Charles II , created a global monopoly on the slave trade . William M. Rice , who founded Rice University , wanted the institution to be \u201c whites only. \u201d Elihu Yale , who founded Yale University , was a slave trader as well . Oh , and you bet some liberals were not happy with Kelly making fun of them .\nFYI : I \u2019 m not stopping until justice is done . @ RiceUniversity has until next week to remove this statue of racist founder William M. Rice from its campus . Or we will march on Rice . Rice believed that school should be \u201c for whites only \u201d . Not in my America . ? ? ? # CancelRice pic.twitter.com/jAqXltoszY \u2014 Jesse Kelly ( @ JesseKellyDC ) June 22 , 2020\nAnyone displaying a \u2018 Yale \u2019 logo in any form is championing the name of a man responsible for this genocide of Black people .
