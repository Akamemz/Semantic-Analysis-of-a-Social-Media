As many as 60,000 children work in brick kilns across the country .\nI \u2019 m always skeptical that the work I do as a reporter will make a lasting difference . But in this case it did .\nIt started when Monitor photographer Ann Hermes and I , with the help our trusty fixer , found Dorje Lama , a 12-year-old boy working at a brick kiln outside of Kathmandu , Nepal . After hearing his heartbreaking story , we shared it with the activist who is the focus of my story .\nA few weeks later I got word that Dorje had been rescued from the brick kiln and was starting a new life at a children \u2019 s home in Kathmandu . I was so relieved and grateful when I heard the news . It was an experience I won \u2019 t soon forget .\nEducation writer Stacy Teicher Khadaroo gained new perspective as a parent when she visited Flint , Mich. , where the taps in the schools and many people \u2019 s homes are still not safe .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Parent and volunteer Sandra Hinman poses with her children Chase , 8 , and Troy,12 , at the Holmes STEM Academy 's community garden on Sept. 29 in Flint , Mich.

Hinman was devastated to learn her children had been exposed to lead , she says it also makes them understand how precious things are : \u201c There are children all over the world that have to drink [ unclean water ] every day . We \u2019 re fortunate to live in a country where people are sending us bottled water ... \u201d\nFor Africa correspondent Ryan Lenora Brown , one of the most striking refugee stories of the year was that of the first Refugee Olympic Team .\nRyan Lenora Brown Garkuouth Puok Diep ( l. ) , a South Sudanese marathoner who hopes to qualify for the refugee Olympic team , runs in Eldoret , Kenya , with his training partner , Kenyan Michael Cheboi .\nIn April , I had the chance to spend a week with 15 of the athletes competing to be on that team \u2013 a group of runners from South Sudan , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and Somalia who were being trained by one of Kenya \u2019 s greatest distance runners , Tegla Loroupe .\nThere are many chances as a reporter to write about the plight of refugees \u2013 their struggles and their sorrows \u2013 but fewer to give readers a window onto other , more prosaic parts of their lives \u2013 their ambitions , their hobbies , their hopes . I hope this story does that .\nIn 2014 , Sunni jihadists from ISIS killed more than 1,700 Shiite cadets in the Iraqi city of Tikrit , which seemed set to trigger an especially brutal blood feud . But it didn \u2019 t happen . The reasons why captivated veteran war reporter Scott Peterson .\nSince I started covering Iraq in 1991 , there has been very little good news . So I was very pleasantly surprised to write about how Sunni and Shiite politicians in Tikrit worked with Iraqi peace facilitators to overcome demands for revenge .\n\u201c When we started , all the signs were bad.\u2026 We thought it was a lost cause , \u201d the mayor of Tikrit , Omar Tariq al-Shindah , told me .\nThrough a carefully calibrated solution of accountability and apology , tens of thousands of displaced Sunnis returned safely home , and Shiites found a degree of justice . The result could yield lessons for Iraq to break the cycle of sectarian conflict .\nA different story of migration : Shahzad and his Austrian foster family\nA fellow journalist happened to tell European bureau chief Sara Miller Llana about an Afghan boy who had lost his entire family and traveled to Europe mainly on foot \u2013 and was taken in by his German teacher 's family .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Shahzad Haidari ( facing camera ) eats dinner with his foster family in Vienna .\nAfter covering hardship on the migrant trail for a year , I heard about Shahzad .\nI wasn \u2019 t sure he and his foster family would want their story told , so it was with trepidation that Monitor photographer Melanie Stetson Freeman and I showed up at their house for dinner . But the connection was immediate . And they remain such an inspiration .\nEvery time I hear a horrible story about migration I wonder how this family will process it together . That helps me put the broader refugee story in perspective , thinking about the humans living through the experience and not just numbers or headlines . Though I check in with the family from time to time , they probably have no idea how much they mean to me .\nSimon Montlake \u2019 s interest in whether it was possible to move past the political impasse on guns led him to Ralph Demicco .\nJOHN J. HAPPEL/THE \u2588\u2588\u2588 Ralph Demicco , a gun enthusiast and former gun shop owner in New Hampshire , is working with mental health experts to try to curb firearm suicides .\nMr. Demicco is a fascinating character \u2013 a New Hampshire gun seller and NRA member who wants to prevent gun suicides and is willing to work with public-health officials , who are viewed with suspicion by many gun-rights folks .\nI spent hours talking to Demicco , who told me about the customers who bought guns from him and used them to take their lives \u2013 and the ones whom he did n't serve because he recognized the risk .\nOn my second visit we went to his range behind his house for a photo shoot . After he 'd fired some rounds he asked if I wanted a go . It was my first time , and my aim was bad . But it felt important to stand in his shoes for a minute .\nOne last wild , wooly trip to the hinterlands of China\nPeter Ford , who in March wrapped up his sixth foreign posting for the Monitor , recounts his prescient trip to China \u2019 s last major undammed river .\nPETER FORD/THE \u2588\u2588\u2588 The Nu carves through some of China \u2019 s most stunning scenery and runs toward Myanmar , where it is known as the Salween , and from there into the Andaman Sea .\nBefore I end a foreign posting , I like to go somewhere really wild and wooly . Just before I left China I visited the Nu River , plunging through some of the most beautiful scenery in a distant corner of the country , between Tibet and Burma . The Nu is China \u2019 s last major undammed river , but the government had long been planning to exploit its hydropower potential .\nI sensed that opponents of the dams were beginning to prevail , and my story in April reflected environmentalists \u2019 growing hopes of victory . Those hopes were crowned last month when the government signaled it was abandoning the dam projects . The decision , say Chinese activists , points to the government \u2019 s increasing awareness of environmental issues .\nWarren Richey waded into one of America 's most pitched cultural battles , and came away with a deeper view of the constitutional claims of both sides .\nElaine Thompson/AP/File Barronelle Stutzman ( center ) a Richland , Wash. , florist who was fined for denying service to a gay couple in 2013 , looks around as she is surrounded by supporters after a hearing before Washington 's Supreme Court on Nov. 15 in Bellevue , Wash .\nWhen Barronelle Stutzman refused to arrange the flowers for a same-sex wedding ceremony , the Richland , Wash. , florist never expected to become a national symbol of anti-gay bigotry . She just wanted to live her life consistent with the teachings of her Southern Baptist faith .\nThis was a difficult story to research and write because I felt a strong sense of the righteousness of the gay couple \u2019 s cause . They just wanted to live free as full members of society like everyone else .\nBut because of my own upbringing in a minority religious group that is , itself , sometimes ridiculed and vilified , I also felt a connection with Mrs. Stutzman \u2019 s claim of religious liberty . And I admired her courage .\nIn writing the story I wanted readers to understand what can happen when competing constitutional values collide in a court of law and in the court of public opinion .\nCongressional reporter Francine Kiefer opened the door to an almost unknown aspect of Capitol Hill .\nLARRY DOWNING/REUTERS/FILE Audience members pray at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington , an annual event attended by the president and many members of Congress and other guests .\nNo one is allowed at these bipartisan breakfasts except for the lawmakers themselves \u2013 no staff , no journalists . They are one of the few social events for members of both parties on the Hill , allowing members to really get to know each other , and what motivates each other . It was a story that gave people hope that on some level , folks in the two parties do know each other as individuals .\nRead the full story and listen to the related podcast\nFrancine Kiefer/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Angela Hawkins ( l. ) , who has been to six Donald Trump rallies , and Gloria Salim-Brown , also a Trump supporter , look at Trump merchandise after their monthly luncheon at Prestonwood Country Club in Cary , N.C. , a suburb of Raleigh .\nMy second story , even though you did n't ask for it , was the women 's GOP club of Carey County outside Raleigh , N.C. A woman told me that she knows lots of Trump supporters who wo n't put signs on their lawns but still plan to vote for Trump . Trump 's win was not a surprise if you listened to voters like that . I remained skeptical about an assumed Hillary Clinton win until the end .\nRalph Jennings went to the provincial capital that Rodrigo Duterte had governed as mayor for 22 years before becoming president of the Philippines .\nBullit Marquez/AP/File In this May 9 , 2016 file photo , front-running presidential candidate Mayor Rodrigo Duterte gestures during a news conference in Davao city in southern Philippines . ( AP Photo/Bullit Marquez , File ) Rodrigo Duterte\nSix months ago , when I wrote this story , few people outside the Philippines had heard of Rodrigo Duterte . Since he became president though , he has become internationally notorious for the extra-judicial murder spree he has unleashed against drug users .\nThat may have shocked the world , but it did not shock the citizens of Davao , where I reported this piece from the city \u2019 s parks and streets . Duterte had been their mayor for 22 years and people told me how he had used death squads to clean up city crime . They also told me that this did not bother them much .\nThis article shows how ground-level reporting can signpost the future . Anyone who read this story as Mr. Duterte took office would have come away with a pretty shrewd idea of what his presidency held in store .\nLinda Feldmann thought voters in the heat of battle would n't be thinking about how to bridge America 's political divide after the election ; they \u2019 d be thinking about how their candidate could win .\nEvan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election rally , on Wednesday , Nov. 9 , 2016 , in New York .\nThis year , I am most proud of a story I didn \u2019 t want to write \u2013 a story that posed the question , \u201c After the most divisive US election in memory , can healing and reconciliation follow ? \u201d The concept felt manufactured , given my assignment : Write the story before Election Day , for publication soon after .\nBut I like a challenge . For three weeks , at Republican and Democratic campaign rallies , I asked voters about post-election reconciliation . Some looked dumbstruck . But most warmed to the topic . Some even welcomed the chance to look beyond the negativity of the moment , and imagine ways of healing the divisions the campaign had wrought .\nThe irony is that I suspect most of the people I interviewed , on both sides , thought Mrs. Clinton would probably win . After Mr. Trump won , I decided the piece still worked . In fact , it made sense to run it the day after the election , when about half the nation was in shock and looking for something hopeful to grab onto .\nThe concept of reconciliation transcends partisanship , and the interviewees spoke in that spirit . ( Just to be clear , everyone I interviewed knew the story would run after Election Day . )\nWhen I posted the piece on Facebook , it got a lot of thumbs-up , but also some push-back . One friend , a Democrat , said : \u201c Let \u2019 s see one hard-core GOP try to understand us . Let \u2019 s see any Trump supporter speak out against the hate crimes now going on . When we see Nazi symbols spray-painted with Trump \u2019 s name , it doesn \u2019 t inspire reconciliation . \u201d\nI \u2019 ve seen similar comments in other publications from anguished voters , clearly in no mood to find any common ground or reconciliation . They say the coming Trump presidency poses a threat to American democracy and to the future of the planet itself , and that calls for \u201c hope \u201d and \u201c healing \u201d are misplaced . It \u2019 s time to take action , they say , not hold hands and sing Kumbaya .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nI take all these reactions to heart . Everyone processes a political earthquake in his or her own way .
