    "content": "Hillary Clinton and her supporters are getting worried about Bernie Sanders and his .\nBecause of this , the Democratic side of the race is going through a lurching transition .\nUntil very recently , it was a model primary . The establishment candidate was being challenged by an insurgent , who was pulling her left on a few key issues . It was all issues-based , above the belt , a good warmup for Clinton and a healthy set of debates for the party .\nBut now Sanders has built organization and momentum that make him more than a protest candidate . There 's a chance he could win . He 's a real candidate now .\nThere 's a great deal that goes along with that transition , not all of which has been fully digested yet by the US body politic . Here are three obvious implications :\nThe gloves are going to come off , as the Clinton camp 's somewhat desperate recent attacks show , and the contest is going to get dumber and uglier . As Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein have both argued , Sanders is now going to be pressed to make his policy proposals a lot less hand-wavey and aspirational , a lot more like real governing plans with real trade-offs . Electability is going to come to the fore , in a way it has n't yet .\nBut there 's a fourth implication I have n't seen clearly articulated anywhere , so I want to lay it out . To put it bluntly , Sanders 's transition from protest to serious candidate raises a new question about him and Clinton , namely : Who would be better at being president ?\nIt sounds simple , but it was n't really a test Sanders had to pass before , so it 's not yet been a serious point of comparison between the two . Now it is a relevant question , and worth digging into a little . Answering it depends on clarifying exactly what kind of job a Democratic presidency would be in 2016 .\nClinton and Sanders are not nearly as far apart on policy as both sides would currently have us believe , as Jonathan Cohn argued in a recent column . And the differences between them pale next to their shared differences with any Republican in the race ( hence electability becoming the dominant question ) .\nWhat 's more , Cohn points out , both would spend their time in office staving off Republicans , not passing their dream bills .\nIn 2016 , barring some truly disruptive political event ( which , who knows , Trump may prove to be ) , Republicans are going to keep control of the House of Representatives . They may keep control of the Senate as well , though that 's less certain , but all they need to block any hope of an expansive legislative agenda is the House , something Obama has learned over and over again .\nSo there will be no single-payer health care , no national carbon tax , no free college , no reparations . Given the current disposition of the Republican Party , it will be a miracle if regular-order business like budgets and debt ceiling bills can get through \u2014 if the government can keep functioning at all .\nOn legislation , the next Democratic president ( if there is one ) will mostly play defense , using the filibuster or , if necessary , the veto pen .\nWhat progress there is on domestic policy will come from inventive , assertive use of executive power and smart appointments , both judicial and administrative .\nTo see how that works , Sanders and Clinton can consult the current officeholder . For his entire term in office , Obama has faced a stark and unprecedented degree of obstructionism . For the last six years , legislation , certainly legislation of any ambition or scope , was , with a few rare exceptions , impossible .\nIt took him a while , but he learned to make the best of it . He got good at it , as his record of accomplishment shows .\nBut getting good at it took a particular disposition and set of skills .\nAs Ezra Klein points out , Obama won on policy but lost on politics . He got a lot done , but it cost him ; polarization remains more poisonous than ever .\nI think the right way to phrase it , though , is that Obama won on policy because he lost on politics , or , rather , because he was willing to lose on politics .\nEven as their obstruction has hardened into dogma , Republicans have retained a talent for manipulating the levers of Washington opinion , which are designed around a ) the presumption of party symmetry , and b ) an overwhelming focus on the president as the center of political gravity .\nIf his party 's agenda is unable to attract Republican votes , it is assumed to be the president 's fault . He would n't meet in the middle , would n't compromise .\nIf political polarization and hostility remain dominant in Washington , it 's assumed to be the president 's fault . He should have called John Boehner more , schmoozed more .\nIf a policy passes on a party-line vote , or through unilateral use of executive action , it is assumed to be the work of a power-mad tyrant .\nThis is n't just a media thing . The public , too , shares a strong heuristic that bipartisanship is a signal of wisdom , or at least acceptability . Mitch McConnell was quite canny in exploiting it , recognizing its power before Obama was even sworn in . As he famously said in an interview about Obamacare :\nIt was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the [ health care ] bill were able to say it was bipartisan , it tended to convey to the public that this is OK , they must have figured it out . It \u2019 s either bipartisan or it isn \u2019 t .\nThat 's why he and other Republican leaders agreed , before Obama walked into the White House , that they would oppose his every move in a unified front .\nIf even a few Republicans strayed , it would lend Obama 's efforts the aura of bipartisanship . Whereas if Republicans stayed united and just a few Dems strayed , suddenly it was Obama 's opposition that was bipartisan , a crucial public relations advantage .\nThe media also exploits this heuristic , as does the permanent Washington political class . There is a powerful incentive , so built-in it 's almost beyond notice , for the president to chase the approval of Washington 's Very Serious People ( VSPs ) by uniting Red and Blue America , or at least by being seen making the attempt .\nThe incentive certainly works on many congressional Democrats , who spend much of their time in a defensive crouch , cowering from anything controversial , including Obamacare and Obama .\nAs long as Republicans kept Obama chasing after that approval and yanking it away at the last minute like Lucy with her football , they were able to effectively neutralize him . It was only after his reelection and \u2014 improbably \u2014 the Republican gains of the 2014 midterms that Obama finally gave up on it for good .\nThat 's when he developed his rhymes-with-bucket list and got to work . And he has racked up wins ever since , breaking the second-term curse in spectacular fashion .\nWhat it takes to succeed as a Democratic president these days\nObama 's success has required two things . One is the self-possession and confidence to weather the disapproval of VSPs and the mau-mauing of Republican opponents . ( A big part of this is settling on the right advisers for the inner circle . )\nThe second is a good sense of the executive machinery and how it might be deployed to positive effect .
