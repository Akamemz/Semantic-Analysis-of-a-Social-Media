Left-wing terrorism was prominent in the 1960s and 1970s , with radical groups such as the Weather Underground periodically planting bombs to protest against \u201c US imperialism \u201d and American involvement in the war in Indochina and to demonstrate their defiance of the political establishment .\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s , rightist anti-establishment terrorism became more prevalent . The \u201c Unabomber \u201d Ted Kaczynski terrorized the nation with several package bombs following the release of an anti-government diatribe . The most destructive single terrorist act before 9/11 was the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995 .
