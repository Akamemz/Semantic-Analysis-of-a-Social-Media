And the Health and Human Services secretary came prepared with a sorry strategy .\n\u201c You deserve better . I apologize . I \u2019 m accountable to you for fixing these problems and I \u2019 m committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site , \u201d Sebelius said .\nThat approach , in contrast to the grudging admissions by many officials during the ObamaCare rollout fiasco , seemed to defuse the hearing . It \u2019 s harder to beat up on someone who admits fault , and the session seemed to lack the kind of fireworks that television loves . The Republicans may have cast her as the Wicked Witch of the West on Halloween eve , but they never knocked her off the broomstick .\nSebelius was bureaucratic at times as the hearing got into the policy weeds , but her buck-stops-here style guaranteed that the apology would be the lead\u2014and deflect some of the heat from President Obama .\nIn fact , when Republican Rep. Greg Harper kept pressing about whether Obama was responsible for the debacle , Sebelius replied \u201c whatever. \u201d This immediately became a thing on the web .\nAnother angle that was hot online : GOP Rep. Joe Barton invoking \u201c The Wizard of Oz \u201d in telling the former Kansas governor : \u201c We \u2019 re not in Kansas anymore . \u201d\nIn an exchange with another Republican , Cory Gardner , the congressman asked why Sebelius wasn \u2019 t in ObamaCare : \u201c You could decide to drop your coverage of your employer . You have the choice . \u201d\nSaid Sebelius : \u201c That is not true , sir . If I have affordable coverage in my workplace , I am not eligible to go into the workplace . \u201d\nRush Limbaugh , for one , found the hearing \u201c very frustrating. \u201d Sebelius was \u201c the punching bag , \u201d he said , but \u201c I don \u2019 t know that the Republicans did much damage . It \u2019 s like they \u2019 re afraid to . It \u2019 s like there \u2019 s still a fear of going after Obama. \u201d Perhaps , he wondered , they were told to \u201c not be mean . \u201d\nMost people don \u2019 t sit around watching congressional hearings for hours , so the takeaway\u2014the featured sound bites and web headlines\u2014will be the apology . Perhaps that \u2019 s why Sebelius kept circling back to the we \u2019 re-also-unhappy tactic \u201c I am as frustrated and angry as anyone with the flawed launch of HealthCare.gov . \u201d\nEven Karl Rove said afterward that she had handled herself well , in part through the use of \u201c mini-filibusters . \u201d\nTo be sure , Sebelius is going to remain the face of a botched program that is not going to be fixed anytime soon . The question now is whether the coverage of Sebelius starts to soften . Could her poised appearance change the \u201c Saturday Night Live \u201d parody image of her ?
