    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nGreg Gianforte, Montana\u2019s Republican hopeful for the congressional seat vacated by Ryan Zinke \u2014 who\u2019s now President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of Interior \u2014 had a little bit of an altercation with one of the reporters who questioned him at his campaign headquarters in Bozeman. And given the special election is Thursday, one might say the unpleasantries came at a quite inopportune time.\n\nThe GOP is sweating, in other words. Moreover, altercation is probably an understatement.\n\nWord is, Gianforte grabbed the guy, Ben Jacobs of the Guardian, with both hands by the neck and body slammed him to the ground, where he proceeded to jump atop him and pound him with fists. Allegedly. But it\u2019s being denied by the Gianforte campaign.\n\nOne witnessing Fox News reporter who said the scene unfolded that way also said Jacobs \u201cscrambled to his knees and said something about his glasses being broken,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nGianforte, meanwhile, has been cited for misdemeanor assault.\n\nGianforte\u2019s story is a bit different. He said he was approached by Jacobs, who asked questions about the Obamacare reform bill. Gianforte said he first told Jacobs he\u2019d talk to him later, and then told Jacobs to speak with his spokesman.\n\nGianforte\u2019s spokesman, Shane Scanlon, released a statement about the event that went this way, The Post reported: \u201c[Jacobs] aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg\u2019s face and began asking badgering questions. Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg\u2019s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground. It\u2019s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene.\u201d\n\nAudio provides some insights into what transpired, as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of you guys,\u201d Gianforte can be heard saying, The Post reported. \u201cThe last guy that came in here did the same thing. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. The last guy did the same thing. Are you with the Guardian?\u201d\n\nJacobs replies: \u201cYes and you just broke my glasses.\u201d\n\nGianforte: \u201cThe last guy did the same damn thing.\u201d\n\nJacobs: \u201cYou just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.\u201d\n\nGianforte: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nWhom to believe?\n\nWell, either way, Gianforte lost it. The audio makes that clear. Gianforte, a Republican, ought to know he\u2019s under the spotlight held by a largely liberal-leaning press. If he can\u2019t stand the heat in the comfort of his own campaign headquarters, how\u2019s he going to fare in the comparative hot seat of Capitol Hill politicking?\n\nCall it a teachable moment. You can\u2019t be grabbing reporters around the neck and body-slamming them to the ground just because they ask pesky questions in overly aggressive manners. It just isn\u2019t done \u2014 it\u2019s not polite. Not saying Gianforte is guilty of doing this \u2014 though he was cited for misdemeanor assault, so he certainly got physical with the journalist to some degree. But in general, note to all Republicans, particularly Republicans hoping to win high political offices that put them under the mainstream media gun: Take care.
