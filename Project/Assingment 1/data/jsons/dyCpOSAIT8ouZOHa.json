    "content": "The Justice Department was running into immediate hurdles Monday in its investigation of possible civil rights violations by George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin -- namely , that after examining the case for more than a year , the evidence has not changed .\nThough the department announced after Zimmerman 's acquittal that it would consider a possible federal case , previously filed FBI documents show agents have not turned up any accounts that Zimmerman , before the February 2012 shooting , exhibited racial bias . Sanford police detective Chris Serino also told FBI agents last year that he considered Zimmerman as having `` a little hero complex , but not as a racist . ''\nAttorney General Eric Holder , in his first post-verdict comments , confirmed Monday during a speech in Washington , D.C. , that his department continues to investigate while signaling concern for the position of the Martin family and those -- such as the NAACP -- pressuring the DOJ . He said the department is `` mindful of the pain felt by our nation '' over the `` tragic , unnecessary shooting death '' of Martin .\n`` The Justice Department shares your concern -- I share your concern , '' Holder said .\nHe added that the shooting provides an opportunity to speak `` honestly '' about the charged issues involved in the case , and that `` we must not ... let this opportunity pass . '' Holder even appeared to suggest the possibility of bias in this case , saying it 's important to address `` underlying attitudes , mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents . ''\nStill , the attorney general said his department would act in a `` manner that is consistent with the facts and the law . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated that President Obama would keep his distance from the consideration , adding that the merits of the case will be `` evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice . ''\nBut Florida defense attorney Brian Tannebaum told FoxNews.com that the `` number one challenge '' for DOJ is the evidence , or lack thereof .\n`` There 's been an acquittal . The evidence has not changed . It 's not like the feds are going to go in and find more evidence , '' he said .\nTannebaum said he understands the Justice Department was responding to intense public sentiment , but `` I do n't foresee it becoming a federal case . ''\nThe question of racial bias is key because if the Justice Department were to pursue a federal case against Zimmerman , federal hate-crimes law is one of the few tools the department would have .\nThe statute itself bars `` willfully '' causing injury to someone else `` because of the actual or perceived race , color , religion , or national origin of any person . ''\nThe department has used federal civil rights law before to pursue defendants who had been acquitted at the state level . But in what is perhaps the most famous such case -- the Rodney King beating -- the circumstances were different .\nFirst , there was a highly publicized video of the King beating . No such video of the Martin shooting is known to exist .\nSecond , the two officers ultimately convicted on federal charges in that case were charged with using or permitting unreasonable force under `` color of law '' -- this applies only to law enforcement .\nThe separate federal hate-crimes law applies to both law enforcement and civilians . But it 's not clear how the Justice Department could prove racial bias .\nSerino , the Sanford detective , told FBI agents last year that after examining the case , it appeared Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because of his `` attire , the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community . ''\nSerino told the FBI that there had been several burglaries in the area , and that gang members in the community `` typically dressed in black and wore hoodies . ''\n`` When Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody , Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious , '' Serino said , while describing Zimmerman as `` overzealous . '' The FBI document was posted on the Smoking Gun website .\nMcClatchy also has reported on another set of documents that show FBI agents interviewed a dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias but nobody would say Zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting .\nStill , the Justice Department agreed to requests from NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous and several lawmakers to keep investigating the defendant .\n`` The Department of Justice 's Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division , the United States Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Florida , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation , as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial , '' the Justice Department said in a statement Sunday . `` Experienced federal prosecutors will [ now ] determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction , and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department 's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial . ''\nThe department may find itself in a vulnerable spot , not only because of prior interviews which found no evidence of bias .\nLast week , a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the `` pressure campaign '' against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year .
