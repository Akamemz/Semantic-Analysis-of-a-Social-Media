    "content": "Despite a lively question-and-answer session for the first of this week \u2019 s two historic gay marriage cases , the nine Supreme Court justices on Tuesday offered no clear clues on whether they will back traditional marriage or affirm the right to same-sex unions \u2014 or just kick the judicial can down the road .\nTuesday \u2019 s case could settle the standoff in California over gay marriage , and the second case , to be argued Wednesday , challenges a federal law that only recognizes marriages of one man and one woman , preventing gay couples from accessing the benefits afforded straight couples .\nTaken together , the two cases could permit the nation \u2019 s highest court to answer important questions about the legality of gay marriage and how sexual orientation should be treated when equal rights are an issue .\nThousands of protesters for and against gay marriage gathered at the Capitol and Supreme Court to make their voices heard .\nOn Tuesday , in a packed courtroom , the high court heard oral arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry , a case involving the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , a voter-passed California initiative that defines marriage as only the unions of one man and one woman .\nA key area of inquiry was what would happen if the court struck down Proposition 8 .\nSEE ALSO : Both sides optimistic , uncertain as gay marriage arguments end\nWould the ruling be limited to legalizing gay marriage in California ? justices asked . Or would it also force a few other states that have domestic partnerships or civil unions to convert them to marriage ? Or would it become a national ruling , forcing all states to strike down their man-woman marriage laws ?\n\u201c The problem with the case is that you \u2019 re really asking , particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite , for us to go into uncharted waters , \u201d observed Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy .\nFormer Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson , representing two same-sex couples who want to overturn Proposition 8 , responded that the high court had ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down laws banning interracial marriage .\nMr. Olson \u2019 s answer wasn \u2019 t completely satisfying for Justice Kennedy , but he and the other justices moved on , posing a wide range of questions to Mr. Olson ; Charles J. Cooper , who represented Dennis Hollingsworth and other supporters of Proposition 8 ; and Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. , who came as a friend of the court in support of Mr. Olson \u2019 s side .\nMr. Cooper was asked about the legal injuries to some 37,000 children being raised by gay couples who can not marry . \u201c The voice of those children is important in this case , don \u2019 t you think ? \u201d asked Justice Kennedy .\nMr. Cooper \u2019 s answer was that there wasn \u2019 t any data on such a subject .\nAssociate Justice Stephen G. Breyer also wanted to know why marriage \u2014 as a procreative institution \u2014 is not good for gay couples but OK for opposite-sex couples who can \u2019 t have children . \u201c Couples that aren \u2019 t gay but can \u2019 t have children get married all the time , \u201d Justice Breyer said to Mr. Cooper .\n\u201c The concern is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its historic traditional , procreative purposes , \u201d Mr. Cooper replied . It \u2019 s also a concern , he added , to have the age-old institution of marriage refocused \u201c away from the raising of children \u201d to something that meets the \u201c emotional needs and desires of adults . \u201d\nProposition 8 , Mr. Olson said , \u201c walls off \u201d marriage from gay and lesbian couples , \u201c labeling their most cherished relationships as second-rate , different , unequal and not OK . \u201d\nBut then he was asked pointedly if California gay couples \u2014 who already have all the rights and responsibilities in marriage in domestic partnerships \u2014 are just after the \u201c label \u201d of marriage .\nSince they have every other right , \u201c all you \u2019 re interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label . It \u2019 s just about the label , \u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said .\nMr. Olson countered by saying that \u201c there are certain labels in this country that are very , very critical , \u201d and marriage has \u201c a status . \u201d\nChief Justice Roberts agreed , but added that \u201c maybe it is the procreative aspect that makes it a fundamental right . \u201d\nEven the brief history of gay marriage was delved into , with Associate Justice Samuel Anthony Alito Jr. noting that such nuptials are \u201c newer than cellphones or the Internet , \u201d while Associate Justice Antonin Scalia repeatedly asked Mr. Olson about exactly \u201c when \u201d it become unconstitutional to prohibit gays from marriage .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t prescribe law for the future . We decide what the law is , \u201d said Justice Scalia . \u201c I \u2019 m curious \u2014 when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage ? 1791 ? 1868 , when the 14th Amendment was adopted ? \u201d\nMr. Olson tried to answer rhetorically , saying the same could be asked of school segregation and interracial-marriage bans . \u201c Don \u2019 t give me a question to my question , \u201d Justice Scalia replied , but even as the audience laughed , the justice pressed again on , asking again , \u201c when \u201d did the Constitution change on marriage ?\n\u201c There \u2019 s no specific date in time , \u201d Mr. Olson finally responded . \u201c This is an evolutionary cycle . \u201d\n\u201c Well , how am I supposed to know how to decide a case \u2026 if you can \u2019 t give me a date when the Constitution changes ? \u201d Justice Scalia said .\nAfter the court session ended , many media pundits concluded that Proposition 8 has no chance of being upheld , and the only questions are how the court would strike it down .\nIf the court dismisses the case with no ruling at all , it is widely believed that an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California .\nThe session , which ran about 80 minutes long , riveted the 400 people in the courtroom , which included actor-director Rob Reiner , who opposes Proposition 8 ; and leading gay-rights lawyers including Mary L. Bonauto of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , and Evan Wolfson , leader of Freedom to Marry .\nAndrew Pugno , general counsel of ProtectMarriage.com , which petitioned the court with Dennis Hollingsworth and others , to hear its case to uphold Proposition 8 , said he thought the hearing went \u201c very well \u201d and that Mr. Cooper spoke clearly on their behalf .\n\u201c We have every confidence that the nine justices will resist the political pressure to prematurely end the national debate about the definition of marriage , \u201d he said , adding that gay marriage is \u201c a social experiment that needs no special protection by or recognition from the U.S. Supreme Court . \u201d\nPresident Obama , who personally supports same-sex marriage , received updates at the White House on Tuesday about the oral arguments , and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler were among the White House officials who attended the oral arguments .\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said public officials who are expressing support for same-sex marriage , and polls reflecting more public support for it , are a \u201c welcome phenomenon . \u201d\n\u201c The president has noted \u2026 the transformation that \u2019 s been taking place in American society on these issues , \u201d Mr. Carney said . \u201c It is a recognition by an increasing number of Americans that gay and lesbian Americans ought not to be discriminated against .
