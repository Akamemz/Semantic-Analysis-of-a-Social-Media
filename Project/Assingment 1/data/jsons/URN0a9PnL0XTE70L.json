    "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not exactly done wonders for the US-Israel relationship . In the weeks before Israel 's election , he publicly undermined President Obama in an unprecedented , Republican-hosted speech to Congress , then went home and repudiated the two-state peace process that both American political parties have supported for years . His re-election looks like bad news for the US-Israel relationship , and it is .\nBut the issues between America and Israel run much deeper than Netanyahu and Obama , and the Israeli leader is a symptom of those issues as much as he is a cause . In Israel , politics are trending to the right , something that helped Netanyahu to victory but that also risks yet more disagreements with the US . Meanwhile , in the US , Israel is becoming a more partisan issue , with Democrats increasingly open to challenging the bipartisan consensus .\nThe clash between these two allies is built into the identity of the Israeli right and of both American parties . And it threatens some of the foundational elements of the US-Israel relationship .\nAt its most basic level , this is about policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict\nThe conflict between Obama and Netanyahu \u2014 which really started over Obama 's forceful attempt to rein in settlement growth in 2009 \u2014 reflects a longstanding source of tension between the United States and the Israeli right . The US believes in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , while Netanyahu and the Israeli right are at best skeptical , and at worst actively hostile , to the idea of a Palestinian state .\nThis has been causing conflict between Americans presidents and more conservative Israeli leaders for over 20 years . George H.W .

George W.

That 's partly because of the rightward shift in Israeli politics , but there 's more to it .

That will likely be true regardless of which party holds the White House ; both parties have supported the two-state solution .\n`` The premise of our position internationally has been to support direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians , '' a senior White House official told the New York Times after the Israeli election . `` We are now in a reality where the Israeli government no longer supports direct negotiations .
