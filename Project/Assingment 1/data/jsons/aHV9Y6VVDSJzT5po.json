He said the company also briefed the FBI for `` two or three hours '' on Monday during a meeting in St. Louis .\n`` They were very open '' to the new information , Stammberger said .\nAmong other details , he said Norse has data about the malware samples that point to `` super , super detailed insider information '' that only a Sony insider would have .\nThe briefing by Norse is the latest example of the doubts being raised by private cybersecurity analysts about the FBI 's claim that Kim Jong-un 's regime was behind the attack .
