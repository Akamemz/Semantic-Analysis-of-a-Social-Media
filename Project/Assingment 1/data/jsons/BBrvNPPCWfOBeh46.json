''\nPolling conducted shortly after that speech proved that to be a shrewd political framing of the choice facing the nation .

So do 57 percent of independent voters . But a narrow majority of Democrats ( 55 percent ) disagree .\nThe divide among Democrats can be seen in other polling data as well . Forty-eight percent of Democrats would probably vote for a candidate who considers themself to be a socialist . However , 39 percent would prefer a candidate who considers socialism to be a threat to the United States .\nFor Democrats , the actual danger is even larger . The party has drifted far to the left politically , and many party leaders seem to believe that the nation is ready to embrace the socialism of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . To bolster that case , they cite polling data showing that roughly 40 percent of the population has a favorable opinion of socialism .\nAt ScottRasmussen.com , however , we dug a little deeper into the policy preferences of those voters who like socialism . At a very general level , their attitudes reflect many of the talking points used by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez . They believe everyone should have access to quality health care , we should all be treated equally and with dignity , every American should be able to earn a decent living and we should protect the environment .\nBut that does n't mean people who like socialism are hellbent on having the federal government take charge of solving those issues -- quite the contrary . In fact , a majority ( 54 percent ) of those who express a favorable opinion of socialism also believe that it would be better for our nation to have less government control of the economy .\nThat may sound like a contradiction to those who remember the historical meaning of socialism . But for many , that meaning no longer applies in the 21st century . Among voters today who like socialism , just 32 percent believe it leads to higher taxes and more government control . And 82 percent of those voters also have a favorable opinion of free markets .\nThe bottom line is that growing support for the term `` socialism '' does not translate into growing support for traditional socialist policies .
