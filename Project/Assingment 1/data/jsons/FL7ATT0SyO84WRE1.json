The Green New Deal proposes no such thing . But a supporting document put out by the office of liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , made a joke about the problem of cow flatulence . From this , conservative websites and Fox commentators spun the narrative of a \u201c cow ban \u201d \u2013 and the fiction ultimately seeped far beyond the right-wing bubble . It \u2019 s just one example of the challenge a bifurcated media creates for American politics and unity .\nIn some ways , the talk about Americans trapped in news echo chambers may be exaggerated . That \u2019 s because the people who routinely bemoan the other side \u2019 s \u201c fake news \u201d are also the most dedicated partisans \u2013 and a relatively small share of the population . Yet this doesn \u2019 t mean biased or distorted information has little effect .\nOne of the defining aspects of modern politics is that voters on the right and left are consuming entirely different diets of news . \u201c Why didn \u2019 t The New York Times cover [ story X ] on page one ? \u201d is a common complaint from conservatives . \u201c Why did Fox ignore [ this thing President Donald Trump did ] \u201d liberals retort .\nSometimes it seems as if the deepest divide in American politics is not so much between Republicans and Democrats as between voters who watch Fox News , and those who don \u2019 t .\nFor instance , 84 % of Fox-viewing Republicans support President Donald Trump \u2019 s declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall , according to a March Navigator Research survey . But among the rest of America \u2013 including members of the GOP who don \u2019 t watch Fox \u2013 only 21 percent think the emergency is a good idea .\nSplits like this have led to a lot of recent critical examination of Fox \u2019 s role in the modern U.S media ecosystem . Critics have called it \u201c state TV \u201d for the Trump era , and traced the entwining relationships between Fox executives and on-air stars and administration officials and government regulators .\nBut focusing on the role of one outlet , however big and influential , ignores the larger context of an entire American media ecosystem increasingly divided between an insular conservative wing , and a center-left wing derided and praised as the \u201c MSM \u201d ( mainstream media ) .\nIt \u2019 s a partition that produces not so much dual echo chambers as different realities . It \u2019 s not just that the two media spheres have divergent attitudes toward the same stories . Often , they chase different stories entirely \u2013 which the other side barely hears about at all .\nOne of the defining aspects of modern politics is that the base voters of the Republican and Democratic parties are consuming entirely different diets of news .\nThis reality isn \u2019 t a phenomenon born in the Age of Trump . Conservative activists have worked with varying degrees of success to create print and broadcast outlets that explicitly promote their beliefs since the 1950s . Their big breakthrough came with the rise of Ronald Reagan . Now they have a powerful sphere of influence that features TV and talk radio stars and increasingly aggressive online sites .\n\u201c I would not say it is just Fox News . It is that entire conservative media bubble that matters , \u201d says Nicole Hemmer , an assistant professor at the University of Virginia \u2019 s Miller Center of Public Affairs and author of \u201c Messengers of the Right : Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics . \u201d\nTo see how America \u2019 s media division can lead to misunderstanding \u2013 and perhaps worse \u2013 let \u2019 s take a look at a specific incident that happened on the floor of the House of Representatives in January .\nIt was in the midst of the government shutdown . Tensions between the parties were high . The House had already adjourned for the week , so C-SPAN cameras were off . Groups of Republicans and Democrats were milling about , and Rep. Tony Cardenas , a California Democrat of Mexican heritage , was waiting to speak .\n\u201c Go back to Puerto Rico ! \u201d yelled a Republican , later identified as Rep. Jason Smith from Missouri .\nCongressman Cardenas and his fellow Democrats were shocked . They thought it was an ethnically tinged slur hurled at a lawmaker who happened to look Hispanic . It was the kind of insult he \u2019 d heard as a kid , said Mr. Cardenas .\nBut that was not the case , Congressman Smith said later in an apology . His barb had been aimed at all the Democrats \u2013 30 of whom had spent the previous weekend on a fundraising jaunt in San Juan organized by an arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus .\nChuck Burton/AP/File MSNBC host Rachel Maddow speaks during a Democratic presidential forum at Winthrop University in Rock Hill , South Carolina , Nov. 6 , 2015 . In the Trump era , Ms. Maddow has turned politics into prime-time entertainment for liberals worried about the state of the presidency .\nThe trip had been heavily covered by conservative media , with the general theme of \u201c Democrats leave Washington for a tropical boondoggle during the government shutdown. \u201d But it was barely mentioned on non-conservative outlets \u2013 and as a result the Democratic lawmakers hadn \u2019 t gotten the reference . ( As part of his apology , Mr. Smith said that he and Mr. Cardenas should get to know each other better . )\n\u201c That people need this explained suggests that the \u2018 Dems partied in Puerto Rico \u2019 stuff didn \u2019 t reach escape velocity out of Fox News , \u201d tweeted Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel at the time .\nIt \u2019 s far from the only story that didn \u2019 t cross the partisan barrier . \u201c Uranium One , \u201d a story involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s alleged involvement in the sale of American uranium reserves to the Russian state nuclear company was heavily discussed on Fox News , Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s show , and other conservative outlets in 2017 . It received much less attention on non-conservative media . Mr. Limbaugh and others saw this as evidence of overt liberal bias . The MSM explanation was that the pieces of the purported conspiracy didn \u2019 t add up .\nThe Seth Rich murder received similar bifurcated treatment . Mr. Rich , an employee of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , was killed near his Washington apartment on July 10 , 2016 . Online conspiracy theorists quickly began whispering , without evidence , that the young Democratic operative , not Russia , had leaked a trove of DNC emails to WikiLeaks and paid with his life .\nIn the spring of 2017 the story exploded onto Fox News , which picked up a piece from a local D.C. affiliate alleging that Mr. Rich had contacted WikiLeaks and that law enforcement was covering up the trail . Popular host Sean Hannity ran numerous prime time segments on this false theory .\nBut the Rich story soon fell apart in a tangle of recanting sources and false claims . Fox officially retracted it a few days after it first ran . Non-conservative media focused heavily on the case \u2019 s collapse \u2013 the liberal-leaning Vox site , for instance , ran a post headlined \u201c The Bonkers Seth Rich Conspiracy Theory \u2013 Explained . \u201d\nWhat do the courses run by these stories say about the structure of American media today ?\nWhat they illustrate is that there is not one media ecosystem , but two separate spheres that respond to different incentives and operate in very different manners , says Yochai Benkler , a professor at Harvard Law School and co-author of \u201c Network Propaganda : Manipulation , Disinformation , and Radicalization of American Politics . \u201d\nOne of these spheres is comprised of right-leaning media , from Fox News to Breitbart and talk radio hosts such as Mr. Limbaugh . The other is a center-left composite of everything else , from the legacy newscasts of the old broadcast networks to most daily newspapers and new liberal internet sites .\nTo find out how news moves through these spheres , Professor Benkler and his co-authors used data analysis tools to study hyperlink connections , Facebook shares , and other marking aspects of some 4 million stories from the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the first year of the Trump presidency . Their study showed that right-leaning audiences concentrated to a large extent on right-leaning outlets insulated from the rest of the media . Center and left-leaning audiences spread their attention more broadly and focused in particular on what is often labeled the MSM .\nThis disparity is driven in part by the fact that the center-left in U.S. politics is a broad spectrum that includes ideological , racial , and ethnic diversity . The right is more ideologically focused and remains predominantly white and Christian .\n\u201c You just don \u2019 t have the same obvious coherence on the left . That \u2019 s the shape of political identity in America , \u201d says Professor Benkler .\nBoth sides like to hear news that reaffirms their deeply held beliefs and identities . That \u2019 s just human nature , perhaps unfortunately . Many committed Democrats gravitate toward stories online that promise to expose GOP hypocrisy . Many conservatives chuckle at talk radio hosts who say the \u201c Democrat Party \u201d would institute socialism in America \u2013 if they could only figure out what it is .\nOn the center-left , such stories are vetted and constrained by the structure of the system . Center-left readers and viewers tend to be exposed to a fairly wide range of outlets , many with strong traditional fact-checking mechanisms .\nBut on the right , says Professor Benkler , those barriers are weaker or even nonexistent . Smaller , more radical conservative media outlets compete to see who can be more ideologically pure and define the accepted political narrative . The result is what he calls a \u201c propaganda feedback loop \u201d \u2013 an insular dynamic in which false information and outright conspiracy theories can thrive .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking at the present state of a system that has really been developing for 40 years , \u201d he says .\nTo conservatives , the defining feature of U.S. media is not \u201c feedback loops \u201d \u2013 but left-leaning bias so pervasive that it \u2019 s invisible to liberals .\nThey \u2019 ve felt that way since the early development years of American conservative media in the wake of World War II . By the early 1950s , the nation \u2019 s nascent right wing was frustrated and angry with the political status quo in general and the media in particular . The Cold War foreign policy consensus , in which most Democrats and Republicans backed a steady containment of international communism , was weak-kneed , in the conservative view . Why not push for actual victory ?\nConservatives of the time were also staunchly anti-union and religious , and they felt neither position received enough attention and support from establishment newspapers and radio networks . Some believed the creation of right-leaning media organizations \u2013 not just PR efforts \u2013 was the answer .\n\u201c There was a real belief that their ideas just weren \u2019 t in circulation , and that if the ideas got out there , they could trigger conservatism , \u201d says Dr. Hemmer of the University of Virginia .\nBroadcaster Clarence Manion , book publisher Henry Regnery , and magazine publisher William Rusher emerged as new conservative leaders . With their radio shows and book clubs and the newsletter Human Events , they were organizing a movement as much as spreading a doctrine to the larger public .\nAlong the way , they established some ideological tenets that remain foundational for conservative media today . First , and perhaps most importantly , they insisted that existing media were not just ignoring their concerns about particular issues , but were wearing masks of \u201c objectivity. \u201d They crafted and popularized the idea of liberal media bias , writes Dr. Hemmer in \u201c Messengers of the Right . \u201d\n\u201c This concept \u2013 that established media were not neutral but slanted towards liberalism \u2013 not only shaped the [ conservative ] movement but remade American journalism , \u201d she writes .\nIt may be hard to believe today , but in the 1950s this was a radical idea . The media reflected the bipartisan approach to the times , a sort of economic liberalism combined with right-leaning foreign policy , that historian Arthur Schlesinger described in his influential book \u201c The Vital Center. \u201d Dispassionate neutrality was supposed to be a feature of the American system .\nIn its infancy , conservative media also gathered together into a self-referential and mutually supportive network . If the National Review was opposing a new highway program , for instance , it would point to a piece in Human Events that drew in turn on a person who had appeared on Manion \u2019 s radio program .\nThis built like-minded audiences and provided intellectual underpinning . It also fostered an alternative , exclusionary media environment in which the truth of an assertion was judged on where it came from as much as by what it said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re building up a separate political reality , a conversation that increasingly does not reference outside sources , \u201d says Dr. Hemmer of the movement \u2019 s early years .\nFast forward to 1985 . Messengers of the right had entered the halls of political power . President Ronald Reagan was the keynote speaker at a Plaza Hotel gala in New York honoring the National Review \u2019 s 30th anniversary . President Reagan told the crowd he \u2019 d been a Democrat until he sneaked a look at his first issue of N.R . \u201c in a plain brown wrapper . \u201d\nIn 1988 , radio personality Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s political talk show went national . It was a new kind of ideological communication , that was \u201c meant to provoke as much as proselytize , \u201d Hemmer writes . It proved explosively popular . By 1992 , Mr. Limbaugh was so important a voice in Republican politics that when he arrived at the White House for a short visit , President George H.W . Bush carried his bag inside .\nIn 1996 , media mogul Rupert Murdoch launched Fox News , following a failed attempt to buy CNN . Though Mr. Limbaugh and his fellow conservative talk show hosts remained popular ( and remain so today ) , Fox rose to become the dominant voice on the right , thanks in large part to its prime time lineup of sharp-edged opinion hosts .\nIn 2018 , Fox was the most watched cable network in America . In prime time it draws about 2.4 million viewers on average , depending on the flow of news and the identity of the on-air host .\nFox \u2019 s dominance among Republicans \u2013 and its isolation from Democrats \u2013 can be seen in a few statistics from the 2016 presidential election . Fox was the main source of campaign news by far among Trump voters , according to Pew Research Center data . Forty percent of Trump backers named it as their chief resource for political information , with no other outlet coming even close . But Clinton voters spread their news diet widely among news sources like NPR and CNN and newspapers like The New York Times and others , with none of them individually dominant . Only 3 % of Clinton supporters named Fox News as their primary source .\nIt \u2019 s easy to bemoan the split nature of news and news consumption in America . For those of us who consume a lot of news , it \u2019 s in our face every day . Sometimes Fox News and CNN seem to be covering different Americas . \u201c Why didn \u2019 t The New York Times cover [ story X ] on page one ? \u201d is a common complaint from conservatives . \u201c Why did Fox ignore [ this thing President Trump did ] , \u201d liberals retort .\nBut the talk about Americans trapped in news echo bubbles may also be exaggerated . That \u2019 s because the people who routinely bemoan the other side \u2019 s \u201c fake news \u201d are also the ones most prone to seek out information that reaffirms their own beliefs .\n\u201c Echo chambers are narrow but deep \u2013 most people aren \u2019 t in them , but the ones who are , [ are ] disproportionately politically active and influential , \u201d says Brendan Nyhan , a political scientist and professor of public policy at the University of Michigan , in an email .\nDr. Nyhan was co-author of the 2018 Knight Foundation report \u201c Avoiding the echo chamber about echo chambers : Why selective exposure to like-minded political news is less prevalent than you think . \u201d\nMedia outlets with a significant partisan slant simply do not reach most of the U.S. population , according to the Knight report .\nMSNBC , on the liberal side , comes close to Fox \u2019 s 2.4 million viewership with its most popular programs , while lagging behind Fox overall in the ratings .\nBut taken together , the old warhorses of the MSM \u2013 the CBS , NBC , and ABC nightly news broadcasts \u2013 reached some 24 million viewers a night in 2018 . The Sunday morning political talk shows reached a total of about 10 million .\nMeanwhile , top entertainment shows such as HBO \u2019 s \u201c Game of Thrones \u201d can hit 17 million viewers or more per episode , even in today \u2019 s fragmented world of networks , cable , and streaming video choices . Political programming is a niche , not a main course .\nThe same pattern holds for online news and information consumption .\nYet this doesn \u2019 t mean biased or distorted information has little effect . The biggest impact of echo chambers comes from what media scholars call \u201c two-step flow \u201d \u2013 others might just call it \u201c talking to friends , relatives , and colleagues \u201d .\nStep One : Political junkies hear something within their preferred media sphere that confirms their partisan beliefs . Step Two : They talk about it , repeatedly , to people who have much less news context and are not themselves big news consumers . Result : biased , distorted , or outright false information can spread far beyond the audience of its initial source .\nThis process applies to the opinion shows on Fox News where hosts often engage in fiery polemics , says Dr. Nyhan . \u201c The Fox audience is relatively small , but it plays a key role in funneling misinformation to the Republican base and to GOP activists , elites , and elected officials , including most importantly the President of the United States , \u201d he writes in an email .\nConsider the case of the flatulent cows . Democratic pollster Celinda Lake recently said that when she interviews likely 2020 swing voters , a surprising number will repeat a false statement made by Mr. Trump and GOP allies that the Democrats \u2019 \u201c Green New Deal \u201d proposes shutting down dairy farms and beef production because cattle generate large amounts of methane , a greenhouse gas .\nThe Green New Deal proposes no such thing . But a supporting document put out by the office of liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , made a joke about the problem of cow flatulence . From this , conservative web sites and Fox commentators spun the narrative of a \u201c cow ban , \u201d and injected it into right-wing political conversation .\nDedicated Fox viewer Mr. Trump picked up this assertion and repeated it for his supporters . At a rally in El Paso , Texas , in February he said that under the Green New Deal \u201c you \u2019 re not allowed to own cows anymore . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not true , reported the Associated Press in a fact-check story on the rally . \u201c [ Mr. ] Trump chose to ignore the actual provisions of the plan , \u201d the AP wrote .\nIt \u2019 s just one more example of the challenge a bifurcated media creates for American politics and unity . The different spheres convey not just different views , but different identities , different realities , different emotional worlds .\n\u201c At the end of the day , if one side most trusts Fox News , Hannity , Limbaugh , and Beck , and the other side most trusts NPR , the BBC , PBS , and The New York Times , one can not expect both sides to be equally informed or equally capable of telling truth from identity-confirming fiction , \u201d write Professor Benkler and his co-authors in \u201c Network Propaganda . \u201d\nPart 1 : A system under strain : Is US democracy showing real cracks ?\nPart 2 : Neutral no more : Can Supreme Court survive an era of extreme partisanship ?\nPart 3 : Amid complaints of a rigged system , one woman \u2019 s effort to end gerrymandering\nPart 4 : Risk of a new civil war ?

By the early 1950s, the nation\u2019s nascent right wing was frustrated and angry with the political status quo in general and the media in particular. The Cold War foreign policy consensus, in which most Democrats and Republicans backed a steady containment of international communism, was weak-kneed, in the conservative view. Why not push for actual victory?\n\nConservatives of the time were also staunchly anti-union and religious, and they felt neither position received enough attention and support from establishment newspapers and radio networks. Some believed the creation of right-leaning media organizations \u2013 not just PR efforts \u2013 was the answer.\n\n\u201cThere was a real belief that their ideas just weren\u2019t in circulation, and that if the ideas got out there, they could trigger conservatism,\u201d says Dr. Hemmer of the University of Virginia.\n\nBroadcaster Clarence Manion, book publisher Henry Regnery, and magazine publisher William Rusher emerged as new conservative leaders. With their radio shows and book clubs and the newsletter Human Events, they were organizing a movement as much as spreading a doctrine to the larger public.\n\nAlong the way, they established some ideological tenets that remain foundational for conservative media today. First, and perhaps most importantly, they insisted that existing media were not just ignoring their concerns about particular issues, but were wearing masks of \u201cobjectivity.\u201d They crafted and popularized the idea of liberal media bias, writes Dr. Hemmer in \u201cMessengers of the Right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis concept \u2013 that established media were not neutral but slanted towards liberalism \u2013 not only shaped the [conservative] movement but remade American journalism,\u201d she writes.\n\nIt may be hard to believe today, but in the 1950s this was a radical idea. The media reflected the bipartisan approach to the times, a sort of economic liberalism combined with right-leaning foreign policy, that historian Arthur Schlesinger described in his influential book \u201cThe Vital Center.\u201d Dispassionate neutrality was supposed to be a feature of the American system.\n\nIn its infancy, conservative media also gathered together into a self-referential and mutually supportive network. If the National Review was opposing a new highway program, for instance, it would point to a piece in Human Events that drew in turn on a person who had appeared on Manion\u2019s radio program.\n\nThis built like-minded audiences and provided intellectual underpinning. It also fostered an alternative, exclusionary media environment in which the truth of an assertion was judged on where it came from as much as by what it said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building up a separate political reality, a conversation that increasingly does not reference outside sources,\u201d says Dr. Hemmer of the movement\u2019s early years.\n\nFast forward to 1985. Messengers of the right had entered the halls of political power. President Ronald Reagan was the keynote speaker at a Plaza Hotel gala in New York honoring the National Review\u2019s 30th anniversary. President Reagan told the crowd he\u2019d been a Democrat until he sneaked a look at his first issue of N.R. \u201cin a plain brown wrapper.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, radio personality Rush Limbaugh\u2019s political talk show went national. It was a new kind of ideological communication, that was \u201cmeant to provoke as much as proselytize,\u201d Hemmer writes. It proved explosively popular. By 1992, Mr. Limbaugh was so important a voice in Republican politics that when he arrived at the White House for a short visit, President George H.W. Bush carried his bag inside.\n\nIn 1996, media mogul Rupert Murdoch launched Fox News, following a failed attempt to buy CNN. Though Mr. Limbaugh and his fellow conservative talk show hosts remained popular (and remain so today), Fox rose to become the dominant voice on the right, thanks in large part to its prime time lineup of sharp-edged opinion hosts.\n\nIn 2018, Fox was the most watched cable network in America. In prime time it draws about 2.4 million viewers on average, depending on the flow of news and the identity of the on-air host.\n\nFox\u2019s dominance among Republicans \u2013 and its isolation from Democrats \u2013 can be seen in a few statistics from the 2016 presidential election. Fox was the main source of campaign news by far among Trump voters, according to Pew Research Center data. Forty percent of Trump backers named it as their chief resource for political information, with no other outlet coming even close. But Clinton voters spread their news diet widely among news sources like NPR and CNN and newspapers like The New York Times and others, with none of them individually dominant. Only 3% of Clinton supporters named Fox News as their primary source.\n\nNarrow but deep\n\nIt\u2019s easy to bemoan the split nature of news and news consumption in America. For those of us who consume a lot of news, it\u2019s in our face every day. Sometimes Fox News and CNN seem to be covering different Americas. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t The New York Times cover [story X] on page one?\u201d is a common complaint from conservatives. \u201cWhy did Fox ignore [this thing President Trump did],\u201d liberals retort.\n\nBut the talk about Americans trapped in news echo bubbles may also be exaggerated. That\u2019s because the people who routinely bemoan the other side\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d are also the ones most prone to seek out information that reaffirms their own beliefs.\n\n\u201cEcho chambers are narrow but deep \u2013 most people aren\u2019t in them, but the ones who are, [are] disproportionately politically active and influential,\u201d says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist and professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, in an email.\n\nDr. Nyhan was co-author of the 2018 Knight Foundation report \u201cAvoiding the echo chamber about echo chambers: Why selective exposure to like-minded political news is less prevalent than you think.\u201d\n\nMedia outlets with a significant partisan slant simply do not reach most of the U.S. population, according to the Knight report.\n\nMSNBC, on the liberal side, comes close to Fox\u2019s 2.4 million viewership with its most popular programs, while lagging behind Fox overall in the ratings.\n\nBut taken together, the old warhorses of the MSM \u2013 the CBS, NBC, and ABC nightly news broadcasts \u2013 reached some 24 million viewers a night in 2018. The Sunday morning political talk shows reached a total of about 10 million.\n\nMeanwhile, top entertainment shows such as HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d can hit 17 million viewers or more per episode, even in today\u2019s fragmented world of networks, cable, and streaming video choices. Political programming is a niche, not a main course.\n\nThe same pattern holds for online news and information consumption.\n\nYet this doesn\u2019t mean biased or distorted information has little effect. The biggest impact of echo chambers comes from what media scholars call \u201ctwo-step flow\u201d \u2013 others might just call it \u201ctalking to friends, relatives, and colleagues\u201d.\n\nStep One: Political junkies hear something within their preferred media sphere that confirms their partisan beliefs. Step Two: They talk about it, repeatedly, to people who have much less news context and are not themselves big news consumers. Result: biased, distorted, or outright false information can spread far beyond the audience of its initial source.\n\nThis process applies to the opinion shows on Fox News where hosts often engage in fiery polemics, says Dr. Nyhan. \u201cThe Fox audience is relatively small, but it plays a key role in funneling misinformation to the Republican base and to GOP activists, elites, and elected officials, including most importantly the President of the United States,\u201d he writes in an email.\n\nConsider the case of the flatulent cows. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake recently said that when she interviews likely 2020 swing voters, a surprising number will repeat a false statement made by Mr. Trump and GOP allies that the Democrats\u2019 \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d proposes shutting down dairy farms and beef production because cattle generate large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nThe Green New Deal proposes no such thing. But a supporting document put out by the office of liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made a joke about the problem of cow flatulence. From this, conservative web sites and Fox commentators spun the narrative of a \u201ccow ban,\u201d and injected it into right-wing political conversation.\n\nDedicated Fox viewer Mr. Trump picked up this assertion and repeated it for his supporters. At a rally in El Paso, Texas, in February he said that under the Green New Deal \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to own cows anymore.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true, reported the Associated Press in a fact-check story on the rally. \u201c[Mr.] Trump chose to ignore the actual provisions of the plan,\u201d the AP wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s just one more example of the challenge a bifurcated media creates for American politics and unity. The different spheres convey not just different views, but different identities, different realities, different emotional worlds.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if one side most trusts Fox News, Hannity, Limbaugh, and Beck, and the other side most trusts NPR, the BBC, PBS, and The New York Times, one cannot expect both sides to be equally informed or equally capable of telling truth from identity-confirming fiction,\u201d write Professor Benkler and his co-authors in \u201cNetwork Propaganda.\u201d\n\nOther parts of the \u201cDemocracy Under Strain\u201d series:\n\nPart 1: A system under strain: Is US democracy showing real cracks?\n\nPart 2: Neutral no more: Can Supreme Court survive an era of extreme partisanship?\n\nPart 3: Amid complaints of a rigged system, one woman\u2019s effort to end gerrymandering\n\nPart 4: Risk of a new civil war?
