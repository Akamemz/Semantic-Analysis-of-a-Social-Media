    "content": "\u2022 Grab a rotating hot dog , a Slurpee and some ObamaCare\nLiberal Democrats are angry at President Obama over the CIA , his foreign policy , increasing Wall Street coziness and a host of other disappointments . The left wing is also frustrated with their party \u2019 s presumptive 2016 nominee and in the shadow of a humiliating midterm loss . So they 're acting out . Facing what promises to be a very unhappy two years in the minority with lame duck president and a presidential candidate who is deeply distrusted by the Democratic base , liberal lawmakers have adopted policies and practices they once abhorred from Republicans . And as it happens , the woman leading the charge is the only potential threat to 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton and the area of dispute is centered directly on one of Hillary \u2019 s weakest spots : her deep Wall Street ties . So what does this say about the future of the party and the instigator of this brinksmanship , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ?\n[ \u201c If the president is lobbying , we do not like it , and we 're saying to our members , \u2018 Do n't be intimidated by anybody. \u2019 \u201d \u2014Rep . Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , on opposing the spending bill . ]\nJust getting warmed up - They might not have won this time , but Warren & Co. have shown clout and the ability to organize to disrupt the best plans of the establishment . It seems highly unlikely that Obama and Hillary will be able to keep the rank and file in line , especially since the alliance between the two Democratic leaders is more of a cease fire than a partnership . That means more pressure on Hillary to move left and launch her official campaign sooner than her rumored early spring target . Giving Warren three or four months to raise her profile and stake out far-left positions would make Hillary \u2019 s task of crushing her harder and limit her ability to pivot center as soon as possible . It also means little hope for the president to enact any of the legacy-securing initiatives he had hoped for in his final years .\n[ WaPo : \u201c The provision was so important to the profits at those companies that J.P.Morgan 's chief executive Jamie Dimon himself telephoned individual lawmakers to urge them to vote for it , according to a person familiar with the effort . \u201d ]\nCan Warren still block the bill ? - Senate liberals could still scuttle the deal , but they would need some help from the right , which also hates the bill . Last night , both the House and Senate passed a two-day continuing resolution to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown . The House also passed the \u201c CRomnibus , \u201d the hideously named , $ 1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the remaining nine-and-a-half months of the federal fiscal year ( a conventional omnibus spending plan ) but funding immigration programs for just three months ( allowing Republicans to try to roll back Obama \u2019 s temporary amnesty after the Senate is in GOP hands ) . The House \u2019 s move punted the bill back to the Senate for final passage and eventually Obama \u2019 s signature . But that is not as easy as it seems , with thanks and apologies to Fox News Hill honcho Chad Pergram , here \u2019 s the lay of the land :\nThe Senate reconvened at 10 a.m . ET , but must first finish the National Defense Authorization Act . Time runs out on this bill this afternoon .\nUntil the must-pass military measure is finished , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can not file cloture to move to the vote for the spending package , which requires 60 votes .\nThis is the crucial moment for bill . If Warren and liberal senators get enough help from conservative Republicans opposed to the bill for other reasons , they could prevent it from advancing . But finding 41 votes for a move that would precipitate a shutdown seems highly unlikely .\nMembers from the left and right , however , have some additional options even after it passes . A single senator or a small group could insist on using all 30 hours of debate time , pushing past the two-day emergency funding plan approved Thursday night . That would force leaders to go back to the House for another emergency budget patch . Another vote would give conservatives who say they were hornswoggled by House leaders into backing the emergency bill on the grounds that the bigger bill was dead and buried . And with the shutdown threat revived , liberals and conservatives alike could make some additional demands , or at least use the time to try to find 51 senators to vote against final passage .\nSee ya - Is any of that likely to happen ? No way . But the procedure provides some sticking points to bedevil the establishment but also some unhappy votes for ideological purists . The Senate can avoid this whole mess by invoking \u201c unanimous consent \u201d to vote on the big spending bill this afternoon . However , as the name states , the decision has to unanimous . If one senator objects , the decision is rejected . And that means that the Warren wing and the Republican rebels alike would all have to cave to some degree . With the left and right demanding maximum resistance , a consent vote could be painful . The question will be whether that is more painful than the experience of dragging Congress and the country through that risky tedium to obtain a limited and uncertain goal . Unless they can scrounge up 41 votes in the Senate to kill it , this Frankenbudget is going to stagger forth .\nThat was then - \u201c But for many of them , I call them legislative arsonists. \u201d \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , September 2013\nThis is now - \u201c I thank those who continue to give us leverage to improve the bill. \u201d \u00ad. \u201d \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , December 2104\nGRAB A ROTATING HOT DOG , A SLURPEE AND SOME OBAMACARE\nThe Hill : \u201c ObamaCare ads will now appear on 7-Eleven receipts at more than 7,000 stores nationwide as government health officials expand their outreach in the second year of healthcare sign-ups . Information about ObamaCare sign-ups will appear on the bottom of receipts for anyone using a mobile payment company called PayNearMe , which allows bank-less customers to pay in stores like 7-Eleven and Family Dollar . Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced the new partnership with the tech start-up PayNearMe on Thursday at a store in Washington , D.C. \u2018 Putting these reminders at the bottom of PayNearMe receipts will help get health coverage information into the hands of traditionally hard-to-reach consumers , \u2019 HHS wrote in a statement . The partnership will help HHS \u2018 reach financially underserved and other cash-preferring consumers , \u2019 the statement reads . \u201d\n[ According to the latest Fox News poll , 70 percent of Americans feel the IRS investigation should last until \u201c someone is held accountable . \u201d ]\nWith the economy still sputtering along , unemployment rates have remained high . But among American men , the story has been different . Rather than just losing work , recent years have seen a sharp rise in men dropping out of the workforce altogether . Where did they all go ? NYT reports that since the 1960s the number of unemployed men not working has increased from 5 percent to 16 percent . Only about one third of them are not working because of unemployment . The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics asks the remaining two thirds to describe their situation . About 13 percent of non-workers say they are currently in school . 20 percent of new non-workers say they are disabled , especially for those over the age of 50 . Once out of the work force because of disability , workers are extremely unlikely to return . The remaining factors include being a homemaker , though still rare , the number of men staying home has doubled since 2000 and finally retirement . Early retirement among prime-age workers has actually increased while workers over the age of 55 have put off retirement longer with the decline of pension plans and the increased age for Social Security benefits .\nObama Job Approval : Approve \u2013 42 percent//Disapprove \u2013 53.3 percent\nDirection of Country : Right Direction \u2013 26.3 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 66.3 percent\nPOWER PLAY : HOW WILL FOREIGN POLICY PLAY FOR GOP SIXTEENERS ?\nA debate on war powers , harsh interrogations and domestic surveillance has again roiled the GOP .
