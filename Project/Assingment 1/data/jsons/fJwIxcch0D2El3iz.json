    "content": "Speaking in early December at a ceremony to honor Harry Reid \u2019 s retirement from the US Senate , Hillary Clinton took aim at a target that would have been totally unfamiliar to audiences as recently as the summer of 2016 : fake news .\nShe spoke of \u201c an epidemic \u201d of the stuff that has \u201c flooded social media \u201d over the past year and \u201c can have real-world consequences . \u201d\nThis was reported largely as commentary on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory , which had recently led to an alarming armed standoff at DC \u2019 s Comet Ping Pong restaurant . But it was also pretty clearly an allusion to her own recently failed presidential campaign , especially because she spoke favorably of the idea of bipartisan legislation to curb foreign propaganda news , arguing that \u201c it is imperative that leaders in both the private and public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives . \u201d\nWhile it \u2019 s true that fake news appears to have circulated widely in Trump-friendly corners of the internet \u2014 possibly with some assistance from the Russian government \u2014 the idea that fake news was central to the outcome of the campaign has little basis in fact . The very nature of viral fake news is that it \u2019 s mostly likely to be shared by people who have already bought into a partisan or ideological worldview , with pro-Trump fake news largely shared by Trump supporters to other Trump supporters .\nClinton \u2019 s campaign did have a real news problem , but the problem was with the real news coverage \u2014 coverage that dwelled overwhelmingly on a bullshit email server scandal , devoted far fewer resources to investigating Trump \u2019 s shady foundation than Clinton \u2019 s lifesaving one , largely ignored Trump \u2019 s financial conflicts of interest , and almost entirely avoided discussion of the policy stakes in the campaign .\nTrump ended the campaign as he began it \u2014 unpopular and viewed as unqualified by a majority of voters , with no amount of fake news stories to puff him up succeeding in moving the needle . But Clinton , who began the 2016 cycle with reasonably high favorable numbers , saw them crater under a torrent of email stories with 45 percent of voters telling exit pollsters they were bothered \u201c a lot \u201d by her decision to forgo a state.gov email address , of which 86 percent voted for Trump .\nWhether journalists want to be proud or ashamed of the work done by mainstream press during the campaign is up to them , but it was perfectly normal stories in normal outlets that moved the needle in a major way \u2014 fake news was a total sideshow .\nThe basic idea of fake news \u2014 take made-up stories and present them as if they are factual news accounts \u2014 is not actually particularly new , but the traditional media industry paradigm made it somewhat limited in scope . The Weekly World News had its niche as a supermarket tabloid , but fundamentally the problem with constantly publishing inaccurate stories is that you would develop a reputation as inaccurate that would kill your business model .\nMade-up stories are a bad way to sell subscriptions , and it \u2019 s a terrible way to sell premium ads to brand-conscious sponsors .\nOne is that the web features a lot of algorithmically targeted advertising served up by third-party companies and not sold directly by editorial brands to sponsors . These kinds of ad services make inferences about who you are based on your web browsing history , and then serve ads that are targeted to you . The sites you see the ads on are , from the standpoint of the algorithm , just irrelevant cutouts whose only job is to attract clicks .\nAnother is that Facebook drastically reduces the power of brand reputation over the dissemination of information . Highly engaging content is highly engaging content , and it is routed specifically to people who Facebook \u2019 s algorithms believe are likely to find it compelling .\nThose two factors both operate to reduce the traditional downside to publishing inaccurate stories . The third crucial factor is that increasingly intense competition between media outlets increases the incentive to make things up . On any given day , you tend to have a bunch of different outlets all covering any major story in competition with each other . Creating a genuinely unique scoop is difficult and costly , and its key elements are going to be aggregated by rival outlets . But if you make up a story about a popular figure like Pope Francis or Tom Hanks endorsing Donald Trump , then you get a cheap and easy scoop .\nBack in the early days of \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we accidentally took advantage of the power of getting a story wrong with a piece about how the evening of December 21 , 2014 , would be the longest night in the history of the Earth . This was an interesting story , but it wasn \u2019 t true \u2014 and precisely because it wasn \u2019 t true , we had the scoop all to ourselves .\nOur story was a good-faith error . Everyone involved felt embarrassed about it because we are professionals who take our work seriously . What \u2019 s more , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Media \u2019 s business model does not support clicks over reputation as an editorial strategy . But the power of an inaccurate story in pure traffic terms underscores the extent to which publishing deliberately false stories can be a viable business in the modern world .\nDonald Trump was very good for the fake news business\nBack on November 3 , Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander published a blockbuster story about the Macedonian teenagers who were running a range of pro-Trump fake news websites and making good money by doing it . Amusingly , the group was all concentrated in an obscure town called Veles , where local English-speaking youths worked together on pro-Trump propaganda .\nThe story made it clear that political convictions had nothing to do with the operation . Pro-Trump fake news was a moneymaking scheme and nothing more .\n\u201c Earlier in the year , \u201d the reporters explained , \u201c some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro\u2013Bernie Sanders content , but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content . \u201d\nTrump was good for the fake news business in part for the exact same reason he \u2019 s been good for the real news business \u2014 he \u2019 s a fascinating person and a skilled entertainer , whose unlikely rise to the presidency has been just flat-out weird . But he was also good for the fake news business for the specific reason that the real news about him was generally bad . In the real world , Trump did not receive any unexpected endorsements . On the contrary , the real news was that he pointedly failed to secure the endorsements of living former Republican Party presidents , about a dozen sitting Republican senators , and a wide range of other party elders .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Trump \u2019 s support among conservative intellectuals , writers , and pundits was shockingly low for a Republican Party nominee .\nAnd yet from the moment that Trump secured the GOP nomination , it was inevitable that tens of millions of Americans would vote for him even if he lost . That essentially created an underserved market of people psychologically predisposed to click on and share Trump-friendly news stories that outlets committed to accurate reporting were not generating .\nAfter the election , a follow-up report from Silverman concluded that the most popular fake news stories had actually been more popular than the most popular real news about the election .\nThe revelation that fake news stories had become very popular during the election and that successful fake news stories were disproportionately pro-Trump , along with Trump \u2019 s unexpected election win , led to an enormous surge of interest in the topic of fake news .\nOne consequence of this was a growing interest in the idea that Facebook could and should do something to make its platform less polluted by fake news stories . Facebook itself has indicated that it is going to take steps in this direction , and it \u2019 s at least somewhat likely that we will end up looking back on the summer of 2016 as a temporary heyday of publishing deliberately false stories as a business strategy .\nAt the same time , \u201c fake news \u201d as a concept metastasized in two different directions .\nOne , exemplified by Craig Timberg \u2019 s November 24 Washington Post story \u201c Russian propaganda effort helped spread \u2018 fake news \u2019 during election , experts say , \u201d moved away from a narrative in which Donald Trump was central to the fake news business model and toward a narrative in which fake news was central to Trump \u2019 s political success . Timberg \u2019 s story was heavily based on a report from a somewhat mysterious organization called PropOrNot , which \u201c identifies more than 200 websites as routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season. \u201d Timberg reported that \u201c PropOrNot estimates that stories planted or promoted by the disinformation campaign were viewed more than 213 million times . \u201d\nThis rather striking conclusion turns out to have been generated by describing a fairly wide array of left-wing websites \u2014 including Naked Capitalism , Truthout , Truthdig , Consortium News , and CounterPunch \u2014 as belonging on a list alongside Russian state-owned media and fake news sites .\nThat led to the other direction , in which the term \u201c fake news \u201d has ( like its predecessor \u201c clickbait \u201d ) rapidly been watered down into a general term of disapprobation . Many jokingly referred to Timberg \u2019 s own story as an example of \u201c fake news. \u201d And now on Twitter , the hashtag # FakeNews is used indiscriminately , primarily by Trump fans , to refer to any news or opinion piece that they dislike .\nThe notion of an actual fake news story in which a person deliberately makes up a false story calculated for maximal virality has rapidly faded into the background .\nWhile the Trump campaign was great for the fake news industry , the implication that fake news was critical to Trump \u2019 s electoral victory seems unsupported . The election was close enough that everything mattered , so it \u2019 s certainly possible that white Catholics who were duped into believing that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump swung three crucial swing states .\nBut it also seems clear that the impact of fake news , whatever it may have been , was minor compared with the impact \u2014 for good or for ill \u2014 of the traditional news media .\nA team of researchers working for Gallup found that what Americans heard about Clinton during the campaign was overwhelmingly information related to emails . By contrast , they found , \u201c Americans ' reports of what they have read , seen or heard about Donald Trump over this same period have been more varied and related to his campaign activities and statements . \u201d\nThe stories about Clinton \u2019 s email server , the separate spate of stories about Clinton Foundation emails revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests , and the third spate of stories about emails stolen from John Podesta \u2019 s email account were not fake news .\nThey were very real stories that totally normal mainstream media organizations chose to make the focal point of their coverage of the 2016 campaign . This coverage , though extremely extensive , did an extraordinarily poor job of explaining the actual legal issue at stake in the server matter . Network television newscasts from ABC , NBC , and CBS chose to devote three times as much airtime to Clinton \u2019 s email server as they gave to all policy issues combined . The Associated Press ran a major investigative story into Clinton Foundation influence peddling that treated a meeting with a Nobel Peace Prize winner as evidence of an insidious pay-to-play scheme . The New York Times did a Clinton Foundation investigation that treated Bill Clinton successfully rescuing American hostages from North Korea as scandalous . The fact that public health experts believe the Clinton Foundation saved millions of lives , by contrast , played extremely little role in 2016 campaign coverage .\nFor Clinton and her closest allies and supporters , \u201c fake news \u201d makes a convenient boogeyman because it paints her essentially as a victim of circumstances beyond her control .\nWhatever one makes of the media coverage of her email server and of the continued operations of the Clinton Foundation , those are both things that she really did do and that if she could go back in time she almost certainly would have handled differently .\nBy the same token , for journalists working at mainstream establishments , the focus on \u201c fake news \u201d is a convenient way to connect the dots between an electoral outcome most journalists deplore and larger trends in technology and media economics that most journalists also deplore .\nBut it was real news from establishment outlets that made the difference in this campaign . It was CNN that decided to sideline its usual stable of conservative pundits in favor of a Trump-friendly roster of Jeffrey Lord , Kayleigh McEnany , and Corey Lewandowski . It was network television news that decided Clinton \u2019 s private email server was a more important thing to cover than the policy stakes in the 2016 election . It was the New York Times that decided to dedicate 100 percent of its above-the-fold space to articles about James Comey \u2019 s content-free letter updating Congress on the discovery of new evidence in the email case that turned out to amount to nothing .\nThe sum total of this media coverage \u2014 real stories based on editorial decisions about how to weight and present real facts \u2014 was to give the public the impression that two similarly ethically flawed candidates were running against each other in an election with low policy stakes . The reporters and editors responsible for that coverage can reasonably ( if a bit absurdly ) consider themselves proud of the work that led the public to that conclusion , or they can consider themselves ashamed of it . But the idea that voters were moved by fake stories about the pope rather than all-too-real ones about email servers is a preposterous evasion .",
