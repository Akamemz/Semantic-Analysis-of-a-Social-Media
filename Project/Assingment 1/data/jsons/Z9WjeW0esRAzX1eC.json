Invest in Black-owned companies and funds that support racial justice\nKenneth Chavis , a certified financial planner at Mercer Advisors in Scottsdale , Arizona , says investing in stock of Black-owned companies can have two major advantages for investors : diversification and the potential for strong performance .\nDiversification \u2014 which involves spreading your investment portfolio across companies of different industries and locations \u2014 is key to reducing risk in your portfolio , as is choosing companies of different sizes . As Chavis notes , small companies are often known for their growth potential . \u201c Keeping in mind that some of the Black-owned companies are smaller , there is a ton of research that shows that over long periods of time , on average , the probability that a smaller company will outperform the average large company \u2014 or just the broad market \u2014 is extremely high. \u201d Of course , small companies are also known to be much higher risk , so as always , you \u2019 ll want to vet your investment carefully .\nUnfortunately , there are only a handful of these stocks listed on public exchanges , and weeding through individual stocks to build a portfolio requires research and expertise . So another option is to use your dollars to invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that will do that work for you . The Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF NACP , -0.90 % tracks the Morningstar MORN , +0.02 % Minority Empowerment Index and provides exposure to companies that meet the NAACP \u2019 s guidelines ( though the fund itself is not sponsored , endorsed or promoted by the NAACP ) . Plus , all net advisory profits from the fund \u2019 s management fee are donated to the NAACP .\nPeer-to-peer lending companies like SoLo Funds give people who have historically been overlooked by financial institutions and traditional loan programs the ability to access capital . SoLo borrowers can set the terms of their loan themselves , and there is no formal approval process . Lenders earn \u201c appreciation tips , \u201d and there are no minimum requirements , so you can get started with any amount .\nThe benefit of peer-to-peer lending , Chavis says , is asset class diversification : P2P loans are typically not correlated to the stock market . \u201c It \u2019 s also a good way to help disadvantaged communities get access to capital , either for business reasons or personal reasons , \u201d he adds .\nP2P lending comes with one main risk : There is always a chance the borrower may not be able to repay the loan . SoLo attempts to counteract this by providing every borrower a \u201c SoLo score , \u201d which acts as a platform-specific credit score and is based on your initial registration and how you handle your loans . To further reduce risk , Chavis strongly advises diversifying the loans you offer by lending to multiple people and allocating no more than 10 % of your overall portfolio to this practice .\nYou can reward public companies that donate money to support racial justice with your own investment dollars . Over the past few months , several large corporations have pledged money toward antiracism efforts . By investing in companies that are committed to putting their money where their mouth is , you are letting those companies know you support their decisions .\nRemember , too , that \u201c spending money is investing money , \u201d says Aliche . \u201c You might not be seeing a return if you \u2019 re not an actual stock shareholder , but you \u2019 re putting money into those companies . \u201d\nDon \u2019 t miss : Venture funding remains elusive for Black tech entrepreneurs\nBefore spending your dollars , she advises looking at a company \u2019 s social media , their website and reviewing who is on their team . \u201c Spending your money with companies that are in alignment is critically important , \u201d says Aliche .\nYou may not have angel investor status yet , but you can still invest in some cool startups that aren \u2019 t yet publicly traded .

You can invest on Buy the Block for a minimum of $ 100 ( which is significantly less than most real estate crowdfunding platforms ) .

Explore peer-to-peer lending\n\nPeer-to-peer lending companies like SoLo Funds give people who have historically been overlooked by financial institutions and traditional loan programs the ability to access capital. SoLo borrowers can set the terms of their loan themselves, and there is no formal approval process. Lenders earn \u201cappreciation tips,\u201d and there are no minimum requirements, so you can get started with any amount.\n\nAlso read: 5 ways to support Black-owned businesses\n\nThe benefit of peer-to-peer lending, Chavis says, is asset class diversification: P2P loans are typically not correlated to the stock market. \u201cIt\u2019s also a good way to help disadvantaged communities get access to capital, either for business reasons or personal reasons,\u201d he adds.\n\nP2P lending comes with one main risk: There is always a chance the borrower may not be able to repay the loan.

Invest in companies that financially support racial justice\n\nYou can reward public companies that donate money to support racial justice with your own investment dollars. Over the past few months, several large corporations have pledged money toward antiracism efforts. By investing in companies that are committed to putting their money where their mouth is, you are letting those companies know you support their decisions.\n\nRemember, too, that \u201cspending money is investing money,\u201d says Aliche. \u201cYou might not be seeing a return if you\u2019re not an actual stock shareholder, but you\u2019re putting money into those companies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Venture funding remains elusive for Black tech entrepreneurs\n\nBefore spending your dollars, she advises looking at a company\u2019s social media, their website and reviewing who is on their team. \u201cSpending your money with companies that are in alignment is critically important,\u201d says Aliche.\n\n4. Explore startups or real estate crowdfunding\n\nYou may not have angel investor status yet, but you can still invest in some cool startups that aren\u2019t yet publicly traded. Republic allows investors to find emerging businesses and get in on the ground floor for as little as $10. The site also lets you filter listed businesses to those with Black founders (as well as to those with female founders and other socially responsible investing criteria).\n\nYou can also invest in real estate (and in some cases, the businesses those buildings will house) with Buy the Block, a crowdfunding platform that is all about providing people with an equity stake in their communities and working to stop gentrification. You can invest on Buy the Block for a minimum of $100 (which is significantly less than most real estate crowdfunding platforms). Many of the projects listed on Buy the Block are in historic Black neighborhoods or benefit a local Black community (such as markets that aim to bring produce grown by Black farmers into food deserts).\n\nInvesting in startups and real estate crowdfunding carries a significant amount of risk, and you may lose your entire investment. As always, do your research before making any investment.\n\n5. Rethink your bank\n\nIf your current bank doesn\u2019t meet your needs, consider a Black-owned bank. According to a 2019 FDIC study, minority deposit institutions originate a greater share of their mortgage loans to minorities than non-MDIs. Some are also designated Community Development Financial Institutions, which means 60% of their financing activities are targeted to low- and moderate-income populations.\n\n\u201cI really like small, local banks,\u201d says Aliche. \u201cPut your money toward banks that are reinvesting back into the community where you are, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask what initiatives they have for the African-American community. Even if it\u2019s not an African American-owned bank, they might have more community-focused initiatives than a larger bank.\u201d\n\n6. Learn from and work with Black financial professionals\n\nWorking with a Black financial adviser not only invests your money back into the community, it helps that adviser continue adding their perspective to the predominantly white space of financial advice. You can find a directory of Black financial advisers through the Association of African-American Financial Advisors.\n\nYou can also opt to invest and get financial guidance through a Black-owned investment platform. For example, Freeman Capital is a Black-owned and -founded investment platform that recognizes that the wealth gap is hurting women and people of color, and offers everything from automated investing to consultations with CFPs.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:",
