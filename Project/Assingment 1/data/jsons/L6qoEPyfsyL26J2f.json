It is however , the biggest corporate tax cut in US history .\nIt 's tax day in America - something most Americans dread .\nBut this year , the filing of both personal and corporate taxes has become even more complicated due to the recently passed tax reform bill in the United States .\nPresident Donald Trump touted the legislation in a speech on 16 April in Hialeah , Florida , saying : `` We have the biggest tax cut in history , bigger than the Reagan tax cut . Bigger than any tax cut . ''\nBut while most Americans are filing for 2017 and so wo n't feel the biggest impact until next year - is the claim true ?\nVarious think tanks and websites have attempted to calculate the total reduction in taxes for both US citizens and corporations this year .\nThe Committee for a Responsible Budget crunched the numbers and said President Trump 's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history , measured as a percentage of GDP ( to do so , they used a study from the US Treasury that looked at the impact of tax reform bills passed in the US between 1940 and 2012 ) .\nIf you adjust the analysis for rising prices , President Trump 's tax cuts rank fourth overall .\nBy either measurement , they 're certainly not the biggest in American history .\nInterestingly , President Trump might be half right : it seems that corporations will have plenty to cheer this tax day ( that is , if anyone is ever happy after reading through the US tax code ) .\nHe said in that same speech : `` Our taxes were the highest \u2014 or among the highest \u2014 but just about , I would say ... they were the highest in the world from a business standpoint . That 's why businesses were leaving . Now , they 're not the lowest , but they 're on the low side . ''\nAccording to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office looking at corporate tax rates around the globe in 2012 , this is essentially true .\nMost analyses suggest that in absolute terms , this year 's reduction of the US corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % is the biggest corporate tax cut in US history .\nIt beats that corporate tax cut passed under former US President Ronald Reagan , which lowered the rate from 46 % to 34 % .\nThe key thing to remember here is that very few US corporations actually paid the headline federal corporate tax rate of 35 % .\nMany US companies take advantage of various loopholes - like being able to deduct the interest they paid on loans - to lower their overall tax bill .\nThe US Treasury has said that the effective corporate tax rate was 22 % in 2016 . This average ignores the very real differences in taxes paid by companies - which is dependent on the sector in which they operate .\nBut a recent analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the average US company listed on the S & P 500 index had a tax rate of just 19.3 % last year .\nAnd the number is even smaller for US technology firms , which had an average tax rate of just 16.9 % .\nTechnology firms can often take advantage of the fact that much of the US tax code was written to tax traditional manufacturing companies with physical assets .
