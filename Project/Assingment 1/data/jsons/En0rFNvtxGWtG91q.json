    "content": "On Tuesday , Maine Gov . Paul LePage ( R ) released data on purchases made with state welfare benefits that he claimed exposed abuse , but they only add up to less than a percent of all benefit transactions .\nThe data show that there were more than 3,000 transactions at bars , sports bars , and strip clubs made with EBT ( electronic benefit transfer ) cards loaded with TANF ( Temporary Assistance for Needy Families , or welfare ) and food stamp benefits between January 1 , 2011 and November 15 , 2013 . The state doesn \u2019 t track what was actually purchased , and some transactions can be withdrawals from ATMs at those locations . Given that there are about 50,000 of these transactions every month , or nearly 1.8 million in that time frame , as the state \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) spokesman told the Bangor Daily News , they only make up \u201c about two-tenths of 1 percent of total purchases and ATM withdrawals , \u201d the paper calculates .\nLePage still expressed outrage at this tiny fraction of purchases . \u201c This information is eye-opening and indicates a larger problem than initially thought , \u201d he wrote when the data was released . \u201c These benefits are supposed to help families , children and our most vulnerable Mainers . Instead , we have discovered welfare benefits are paying for alcohol , cigarettes and other things that hardworking taxpayers should not be footing the bill for. \u201d When the Bangor Daily News asked his spokeswoman about the small number of transactions , she responded , \u201c Any amount of abuse in the system that takes away from the truly needy needs to be dealt with , \u201d adding , \u201c We \u2019 re not uncovering anything new . There are always going to be bad actors out there . We \u2019 re simply saying , \u2018 We \u2019 ve got an eye on you . \u2019 \u201d\nHis spokeswoman also said that he will sponsor a bill to address issues with welfare benefits during this year \u2019 s session , including the fact that the state doesn \u2019 t track what recipients buy .\nIf LePage is seeking to paint welfare recipients as wasteful spenders who blow their money on alcohol and cigarettes , the data are not on his side . Nationally , those who receive public benefits such as welfare cash assistance , food stamps , housing assistance , Medicaid , and others spend a bigger portion of their budgets on basics like food , housing , and transportation than those who aren \u2019 t enrolled in these programs . They also spend less on eating out and entertainment . Overall , families who rely on government programs spend less than half of what families who don \u2019 t rely on them spend .\nLePage has made other controversial statements and decisions when it comes to the poor or less fortunate residents of his state . He claimed that 47 percent of Mainers don \u2019 t work , despite the fact that 65 percent are working or actively seeking a job while the remaining percentage is mostly made up of retirees , the disabled , students , and homemakers .
