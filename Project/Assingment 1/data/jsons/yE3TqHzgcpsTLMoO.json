Back in the White House , he blocks honest press queries with all his power .\nThe last person in the world who should be lecturing journalists on how to do journalism is President Barack Obama . Yet there Obama was Monday night at a journalism award ceremony , yodeling banalities about the role of a press in a free society , moaning over the dangers posed by \u201c he said/she said \u201d reporting , and\u2014to the delight of the assembled audience\u2014attacking Donald Trump in every way but name . The press-heavy crowd , convened by Syracuse University \u2019 s S.I . Newhouse School of Public Communications to give the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting to Alec MacGillis , clapped at Obama \u2019 s 30-minute address , encouraging his best Trump-baiting lines about \u201c free media \u201d and the dangers of \u201c false equivalence . \u201d\nWhat they should have done is bombard Obama with rotten fruit or ripped him with raspberries for his hypocrisy .\nHow do we hate Obama \u2019 s treatment of the press ? Let me count the ways . Under his administration , the U.S. government has set a new record for withholding Freedom of Information Act requests , according to a recent Associated Press investigation . FOIA gives the public and press an irreplaceable view into the workings of the executive branch . Without timely release of government documents and data , vital questions can \u2019 t be answered and stories can \u2019 t be written .\nObama \u2019 s \u201c Insider Threat Program \u201d has turned employees across the government\u2014from the Peace Corps to the Social Security Administration to the Department of Agriculture\u2014into information-squelching snitches . If this isn \u2019 t Trumpian behavior , I don \u2019 t know what is .\n\u201c Obama hates the press , \u201d New York Times national security reporter James Risen said not long ago , \u201c and he hates leaks. \u201d AP Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee has decried the \u201c day-to-day intimidation of sources \u201d by the Obama administration , judging it worse than the Bush administration on that score . And in a 2013 piece , POLITICO \u2019 s Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen documented Obama \u2019 s mastery of \u201c limiting , shaping and manipulating media coverage of himself and his White House . \u201d\nAs ProPublica has reported , at the same time the Obama administration has been paying lip service to protecting whistleblowers , it has pursued national security leaks to the press with a vehemence unmatched by any previous administration , using the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers who leak to journalists more times than all previous administrations combined . Obama holds infrequent news conferences , and he wastes reporters \u2019 time by refraining from answering questions with any candor . He claims to helm \u201c the most transparent administration in history , \u201d while bending government policies and practices toward secrecy .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I \u2019 ve seen since the Nixon administration , \u201d wrote Leonard Downie Jr. in a Committee to Protect Journalists report . And it \u2019 s not just Downie complaining . You could break Google by asking it to list all the top journalists who regard the Obama administration as Press Enemy No . 1 .\nThe deeper you study Obama \u2019 s relationship with the press , the more you want to ask what business he has giving out a press award . Was Trump himself busy that night ?\nObama didn \u2019 t invent the White House \u2019 s in-house media shop , which produces videos and other media to disseminate approved \u201c news \u201d to the public and the press . As long ago as the early 1930s , H.L . Mencken was complaining about how the Roosevelt administration \u2019 s press agents choked the information pipeline with mimeographed handouts that lazy reporters would then repurpose as news . But Obama \u2019 s White House has perfected the practice , with a 14-member operation called the White House Office of Digital Strategy that bypasses the press corps with tweets , YouTube videos , Facebook postings and more .\nThe press doesn \u2019 t like that , arguing that it stiff-arms open discourse . Obama thinks it \u2019 s funny . At the 2013 Gridiron Dinner , he said , \u201c Some of you have said that I \u2019 m ignoring the Washington press corps\u2014that we \u2019 re too controlling . You know what , you were right . I was wrong , and I want to apologize in a video you can watch exclusively at Whitehouse.gov. \u201d While it \u2019 s Obama \u2019 s political prerogative to appear when and where he wants to , to fuel his own media operation , and do so on his own terms , it \u2019 s duplicitous of him to operate his own propagandistic operation and then judge the real press for its alleged failings .\nWhat makes Obama \u2019 s speech so unstomachable is the way he praises reporters at an award ceremony by calling their work \u201c indispensable , \u201d \u201c incredible , \u201d \u201c worth honoring \u201d and essential to democracy while simultaneously blocking honest press queries with all the formidable energies of his office . You \u2019 d expect this sort of contradictory behavior from Trump , whom Obama savaged ( by implication ) repeatedly in the speech . At one point , Obama complains about an unnamed politician ( I think you can guess who ) receiving billions in free media , and bemoans the fact that no \u201c serious accountability \u201d comes with it . But hasn \u2019 t Obama been doing the same grift from a different location for the past seven to arrange the same deal for himself ?\nElsewhere in the talk , Obama sought honesty \u2019 s high ground by denouncing unnamed candidates for having become \u201c untethered to reason and facts and analysis. \u201d Obviously he meant Trump . But who is Obama to talk ? He may not be as accomplished a liar as Trump . Nobody is . But he carries the very same contagion : The Washington Post Fact Checker \u2019 s Obama rap sheet is well stocked with \u201c Pinocchios \u201d for the lies and mistruths he has advanced over his White House years .\nShame on Syracuse University \u2019 s S.I .
