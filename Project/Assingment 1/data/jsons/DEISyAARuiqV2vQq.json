President Donald Trump and congressional leaders hoped the measure would send a signal that would help stabilize the stock market and U.S. economy amid fears of recession as economic analysts estimate unemployment levels could hit up to an unprecedented 30 % in April-June with GDP contracting by 50 % , figures not seen since the Great Depression .\nThe Times ' first article about the stalemate was titled : `` Democrats Block Action on $ 1.8 Trillion Stimulus . ''\nShortly thereafter , the headline evolved to `` Democrats Block Action on Stimulus Plan , Seeking Worker Protections , '' which continued stating that Senate Democrats were responsible for blocking the bill , but softened the blow by offering a benign justification for doing so .\nThen came the coup de grace . In its third attempt , the Times ' headline evolved to `` Partisan Divide Threatens Deal on Rescue Bill , '' which made no mention of the Democrats ' obstruction .\nFollowing a deluge of criticism from conservative leaders , the New York Times appears to have modified the story 's headline a fourth time as of Sunday morning to `` As State Pleas Mount , Trump Outlines Some Federal Action ; Senate Democrats Block Stimulus Package . ''\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared on Saturday night that the bill had broad bipartisan agreement , but Democrats blocked the measure after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D ) returned to Washington , D.C. , on Sunday and began demanding changes to the legislation .\nThe Senate is expected to take up the relief bill again on Monday .",
