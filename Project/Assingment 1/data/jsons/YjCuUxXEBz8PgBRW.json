    "content": "Officials in Stockton said Tuesday that mediation with creditors has failed , meaning the city is set to become the largest American city ever to declare bankruptcy .\nCity Manager Bob Deis said officials were unable to reach a deal to restructure hundreds of millions of dollars of debt under a new state law designed to help municipalities avoid bankruptcy .\n`` Unfortunately we have no comprehensive set of agreements with our creditors that would eliminate the deficit and avoid insolvency , '' Deis said at a City Council meeting . He said , however , that the city was still negotiating with some creditors and could reach deals with as many as one-third of them .\n`` We think Chapter 9 protection is the only choice left . If we get any agreements , those will be honored in Chapter 9 , '' Deis said .\nThe Council was expected to vote later on a special bankruptcy budget to plug next year 's anticipated $ 26 million deficit .\nThe budget is expected to suspend debt payments , reduce payments for retiree medical benefits and increase revenue through code enforcement and parking citations , among other steps .\nCity lawyers could file for Chapter 9 protection in court as soon as Wednesday .\nThe river port city of 290,000 in Central California has seen its property taxes and other revenues decline , while expensive investments and generous retiree benefits drained city coffers .\nIn the past three years , officials in the city that was slammed by the collapse of the housing market dealt with $ 90 million in deficits through a series of drastic cuts .\nThey eliminated one-fourth of the city 's police officers , one-third of the fire staff , and 40 percent of all other employees . They also cut wages and medical benefits .\nTo plug next year 's anticipated $ 26 million budget shortfall , a proposed budget to be considered Tuesday night would suspend payments for debts and legal claims , reduce payments for retiree medical benefits , further cut some pay and benefits , and increase revenue through code enforcement and parking citations .\nThe proposed budget includes no major service reductions , Deis said earlier .\n`` The whole purpose of filing Chapter 9 is to avoid an uncontrolled chaotic situation , '' he said . `` Bankruptcy provides the equivalent of a pause button . It retains services and provides structure so you do n't have a bunch of lawsuits . ''\nCity officials say the city has run out of options . In recent years , thousands of new homes mushroomed in Stockton , part of a suburban housing boom that attracted buyers from the San Francisco Bay area and beyond .\nWhen the economy crashed and the construction bubble burst , Stockton was battered by foreclosures and lost income from property taxes and other fees .\nMulti-year labor contracts for city workers carrying escalating costs and generous retirement plans added to the burden .\nIn addition , expensive city investments -- a promenade , sports arena and hotel -- failed to produce an economic boon .\nThe city also has high crime and unemployment rates . It has twice topped Forbes magazine 's list of `` America 's most miserable cities . ''\nUnder a bankruptcy filing , officials would retain power over day-to-day city operations and staffing , but a judge would take over all decisions concerning the city 's debts , said Robert Benedetti , professor of political science at the University of the Pacific in Stockton .\nThe judge would decide which creditors should be paid , how much and in what order . He would make allowances for expenditures needed by the city to function , and it would be up to city officials to decide how to spend that money .\n`` One of the reasons a city might want to go the bankruptcy route is that they do n't want a situation where they have to pay out debts and have to close the police or fire department , '' Benedetti said . `` Filing for Chapter 9 means you 're asking the court to protect you against lawsuits from people who hold your debt . ''\nStockton 's bankruptcy would make it the largest city by population to file for Chapter 9 protection , according to Jim Spiotto , a Chicago bankruptcy lawyer who tracks such cases . He said Bridgeport , Conn. , was the largest city to file for bankruptcy , which it did in 1991 , followed by Vallejo , Calif. , which filed in 2008 .\nJefferson County in Alabama is the largest local government bankruptcy filing to date in terms of the size of its debt . It occurred in November 2011 and was followed by Orange County , Calif. , in 1994 .\nIf a judge approves a bankruptcy plan , money to pay creditors would come from Stockton 's general fund , which pays chiefly for public safety , including police and fire protection .\nExperts say the bankruptcy filing , while protecting the city from catastrophe in the short run , should not be seen as Stockton 's panacea .\n`` Bankruptcy wo n't take away Stockton 's underlying financial problems , one of which is the economy , the high unemployment rate and the high foreclosure rate , '' Benedetti said . `` It will take years for them to come out of this . ''\nStockton was the first city to test a new state mediation law , Assembly Bill 506 , which is less than 6 months old .\nUnder the law , municipalities considering bankruptcy must first negotiate behind closed doors with creditors for up to three months , with the goal of settling debts without filing for Chapter 9 protection .\nStockton officials have said that even with a bankruptcy , they are optimistic . They point to Vallejo , a smaller California city that filed for Chapter 9 protection in 2008 and emerged from bankruptcy last year .\n`` Vallejo is leaner , smarter and they 've got the confidence of their citizenry , '' Deis said . `` I think Stockton will be doing the same . ''\nBenedetti said Stockton has some things going for it : An excellent location , successful inland port and good university .\n`` It has some promising economic resources , so it 's not all down and out , '' he said .",
