Whether it \u2019 s The New England Journal of Medicine or the Bazooka comic books ? \u201d Simpson asked .\nHis comments come as Pruitt earlier this week announced a new EPA rule proposal that would limit the agency \u2019 s use of what he \u2019 s called \u201c secret science . \u201d\nThe proposal would prohibit the agency from citing scientific findings in their rule-making unless the science is available for public review . Critics have argued that the policy would significantly limit the number of studies the EPA could use when drafting regulations and would leave out the \u201c best available science . \u201d\n\u201c Is good science what I agree with , versus bad science is on the other side of the aisle ? \u201d Simpson asked in jest .\n\u201c The science that is reproducible and transparent should drive our decisions at the agency , \u201d he said . \u201c We should be agnostic about the source . \u201d\nRep.

Betty McCollum ( D-Minn. ) questioned Pruitt \u2019 s claims that he has received multiple death threats while in office .\nThe threats are the EPA \u2019 s main justification for Pruitt \u2019 s elevated security posture , including a 24/7 security detail that has cost more than $ 3 million and frequently flying first class .\nMcCollum , the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee \u2019 s subcommittee for the EPA , said her staff asked the EPA \u2019 s Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) about claims Pruitt made at the earlier hearing about death threats .\n\u201c We asked IG [ Arthur ] Elkins about such comments , and he disputed your claim , \u201d McCollum said .\nShe asked if Pruitt wanted to correct his earlier statement that \u201c the inspector general himself \u201d documented the death threats . \u201c Did the inspector general him or herself tell you that you did not face death threats , that they have not found death threats ? \u201d\nPruitt had a copy of a \u201c threat assessment \u201d from the OIG . He read two of the death threats , which he said came through Facebook and Twitter .\n\u201c We all receive death threats on our Facebook page , \u201d she said . \u201c We all do . \u201d\nPruitt shifted blame on a number of issues , including his use of first-class travel , unauthorized staff raises and construction of a soundproof privacy booth .\nSpeaking to lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee subpanel , Pruitt said that his decision to change from flying coach to first class came after a number of threats made to him . He cited an Inspector General ( IG ) report on the threats as proof that a change to his method of flying was necessary , saying , \u201c I was flying coach . I made changes after the threats . \u201d\nHe also cited these threats to defend his security in testimony in a separate morning hearing .\nPruitt cited two examples written in the IG report for why his around-the-clock security team was necessary .\nPruitt spoke as two members of his security team sat directly behind him in the hearing room , one wearing an earpiece .\nThe administrator maintained that he no longer flies first class , calling news surrounding it \u201c a distraction . \u201d\nOn the agency \u2019 s approval to provide substantial raises to two EPA staffers that moved to D.C. from Oklahoma with Pruitt \u2014 one of which Pruitt has previously described as a \u201c close friend \u201d \u2014 the chief said he was not aware of the type or amount of the raises .\nHe said after media reports surfaced he directed his chief of staff Ryan Jackson to change them . Jackson has previously taken the blame for approving the raises .\nPruitt doubled down on comments he made earlier that he was not aware of the exorbitant nearly $ 43,000 cost of a privacy booth installed in his office , saying he was not responsible for signing off on the booth and blaming \u201c career staffers \u201d for being involved \u201c from the beginning to the end . \u201d\nPruitt added : \u201c My objective to speak with you today is to provide confidence , and recognize faults where they have occurred and make sure they don \u2019 t happen in the future . \u201d\nRep. Ken Calvert ( R-Calif. ) opened the Appropriations Committee hearing by sharply criticizing Pruitt \u2019 s proposal to cut around 25 percent from the EPA \u2019 s budget .\n\u201c While some reductions may be in order , cuts of this magnitude put important programs at risk , \u201d the chairman of the subcommittee with authority over the EPA \u2019 s funding said , pointing to eliminations or cuts the Trump administration is proposing to state grants , programs to clean up major waterways and grants to clean up diesel pollution .\n\u201c States rely heavily on these funds , \u201d Calvert said of the state grants .\nCalvert only alluded briefly to Pruitt \u2019 s spending and ethics scandals .\n\u201c We will continue to provide necessary oversight to ensure that EPA and other agencies under this subcommittee \u2019 s jurisdiction are held accountable , remain good stewards of the taxpayer \u2019 s dollars and comply with congressional notification requirements , \u201d he said .\nThe EPA was charged with violating a legal requirement to notify Calvert \u2019 s committee before exceeding a $ 5,000 cap on furnishing Pruitt \u2019 s office when it built a $ 43,000 soundproof booth for Pruitt .\nThe panel \u2019 s leading Democrat also focused mostly on criticizing Pruitt over his proposed budget cuts .\n\u201c The FY [ fiscal ] 2019 EPA budget is reckless , it \u2019 s irresponsible , and it \u2019 s unrealistic , \u201d said Rep. Betty McCollum ( Minn. ) , the subcommittee \u2019 s top Democrat .\nMcCollum , who lived directly under Pruitt when he rented a Capitol Hill condo from a lobbyist for just $ 50 per night he spent there , also criticized the EPA head over ethics .\n\u201c In just one year as EPA administrator , you have violated the public trust by abusing EPA resources and taxpayer dollars , \u201d McCollum said . \u201c Your decisions and actions have displayed a disregard for the ethical standards to which all public officials should adhere . \u201d\nRep. Ken Calvert ( R-Calif. ) opened up EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt 's second House hearing of the day .\nCalvert , chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on environment , started the hearing telling Pruitt of worries he had concerning the administrator 's suggested budget cuts for the EPA for fiscal 2019 .\n`` Cuts of this magnitude will severely impact our ability to meet statutory requirements , '' said Calvert .\nHe ended saying he found Pruitt 's other commitments , such as fixing Superfunds , `` A promising improvement .

Several noted that they hoped to focus on policy questions .\nRep. Ryan Costello ( R-Pa. ) expressed a variety of concerns over Pruitt \u2019 s scandals and endorsed some Democratic criticisms .\n\u201c I think the opprobrium that you \u2019 ve generated on some of these spending decisions is actually warranted . I \u2019 ve reviewed your answers and I find some of them lacking or insufficient , \u201d Costello told Pruitt .\n\u201c I believe you \u2019 ve not demonstrated the requisite degree of good judgment required of an appointed executive branch official on some of these spending items . \u201d\nCostello , who is leaving Congress after this year and not running for reelection , also brought up Pruitt taking his security detail on personal trips .\n\u201c When folks read about trips to Disneyland , professional basketball games , the Rose Bowl , and the additional security detail related to that , that doesn \u2019 t sit well with a lot of people , \u201d Costello said .\nPruitt defended the privacy booth by repeating his earlier claim that career employees at EPA made all of the decisions regarding it , not him .\nAs for the security , Pruitt said the EPA \u2019 s inspector general has investigated various death threats against him and that those threats justify the security measures .\n\u201c These are threats the IG has documented , \u201d Pruitt said . \u201c The IG has said that threats to me as administrator are unprecedented . \u201d\nThe EPA chief defended his need for increased security measures , which include a 24/7 security detail and a vehicle with bulletproof seat covers , because of \u201c documented \u201d threats .\nScott Pruitt cited two examples from an Inspector General report on his `` threat investigation \u201d for why he needs a round-the-clock security detail and has routinely flown first class during travel for business .\nThe two examples Pruitt read were verbal threats made to Pruitt and his family .\nOne , Pruitt said , read : \u201c Pruitt I \u2019 m going to find you and put a bullet through your eyes , don \u2019 t think I 'm joking , I \u2019 m planning this . \u201d\nAnother incident cited in the report seemingly mentioned a threat made to Pruitt \u2019 s daughter McKenna .\n\u201c Threats were directed towards her father , \u2018 I hope your father dies soon , suffering as your mother watches in horror watching for hours on end , \u2019 \u201d Pruitt read .\nRep.

I think that what you said is absolutely true about the public trust and I endeavor to live in a way that respects that , \u201d Pruitt said , as Eshoo attempted to cut in to emphasize her question .\nShe then asked if Pruitt planned to reimburse taxpayers for any of his travel costs , noting he took several flights back to his home state of Oklahoma in the last year .\nPruitt responded that the government had cleared those trips as official business .\n\u201c I may be elected but I \u2019 m not a fool , \u201d Eshoo responded . \u201c That \u2019 s really a lousy answer from somebody who has a high position in the federal government .

I gave direction to my staff to address that , \u201d Pruitt said when Rep.

Ken Calvert Kenneth (Ken) Stanton CalvertMORE (R-Calif.) gaveled the Appropriations Committee subcommittee hearing to a close after roughly two hours of testimony from Pruitt.\n\nPruitt answered lawmakers' questions for nearly six hours total on the day, with Democrats seizing on his ethics controversies and lawmakers from both sides of the aisles pressing him on budget cuts and EPA policy stances.\n\nHe received periodic support from Republican lawmakers, who praised his work thus far and downplayed ethics concerns.\n\nRep Simpson: 'What is solid science?'\n\n4:00 p.m.\n\nRep.

You publicly blamed your staff instead of taking responsibility for your wasteful spending,\" McCollum told Pruitt. \"It seems to be a pattern.\"\n\n\"I've held back on doing this like some of my other colleagues have,\" McCollum said, \"but Mr. Pruitt, I think it's time you resign.\"\n\n\u2013 Miranda Green\n\nDem question\u2019s Pruitt\u2019s death threat claims\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) questioned Pruitt\u2019s claims that he has received multiple death threats while in office.\n\nThe threats are the EPA\u2019s main justification for Pruitt\u2019s elevated security posture, including a 24/7 security detail that has cost more than $3 million and frequently flying first class.\n\nMcCollum, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee\u2019s subcommittee for the EPA, said her staff asked the EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) about claims Pruitt made at the earlier hearing about death threats.\n\n\u201cWe asked IG [Arthur] Elkins about such comments, and he disputed your claim,\u201d McCollum said.\n\nShe asked if Pruitt wanted to correct his earlier statement that \u201cthe inspector general himself\u201d documented the death threats. \u201cDid the inspector general him or herself tell you that you did not face death threats, that they have not found death threats?\u201d\n\nPruitt had a copy of a \u201cthreat assessment\u201d from the OIG. He read two of the death threats, which he said came through Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMcCollum wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\n\u201cWe all receive death threats on our Facebook page,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all do.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Timothy Cama\n\nPruitt continues to shift blame while promising \u2018changes\u2019\n\n2:47 p.m.\n\nPruitt shifted blame on a number of issues, including his use of first-class travel, unauthorized staff raises and construction of a soundproof privacy booth.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee subpanel, Pruitt said that his decision to change from flying coach to first class came after a number of threats made to him. He cited an Inspector General (IG) report on the threats as proof that a change to his method of flying was necessary, saying, \u201cI was flying coach. I made changes after the threats.\u201d\n\nHe also cited these threats to defend his security in testimony in a separate morning hearing.\n\nPruitt cited two examples written in the IG report for why his around-the-clock security team was necessary.\n\nPruitt spoke as two members of his security team sat directly behind him in the hearing room, one wearing an earpiece.\n\nThe administrator maintained that he no longer flies first class, calling news surrounding it \u201ca distraction.\u201d\n\nOn the agency\u2019s approval to provide substantial raises to two EPA staffers that moved to D.C. from Oklahoma with Pruitt \u2014 one of which Pruitt has previously described as a \u201cclose friend\u201d \u2014 the chief said he was not aware of the type or amount of the raises.\n\nHe said after media reports surfaced he directed his chief of staff Ryan Jackson to change them. Jackson has previously taken the blame for approving the raises.\n\nPruitt doubled down on comments he made earlier that he was not aware of the exorbitant nearly $43,000 cost of a privacy booth installed in his office, saying he was not responsible for signing off on the booth and blaming \u201ccareer staffers\u201d for being involved \u201cfrom the beginning to the end.\u201d\n\nPruitt added: \u201cMy objective to speak with you today is to provide confidence, and recognize faults where they have occurred and make sure they don\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Miranda Green\n\nGOP chairman slams Pruitt\u2019s proposed budget cuts\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nRep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) opened the Appropriations Committee hearing by sharply criticizing Pruitt\u2019s proposal to cut around 25 percent from the EPA\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cWhile some reductions may be in order, cuts of this magnitude put important programs at risk,\u201d the chairman of the subcommittee with authority over the EPA\u2019s funding said, pointing to eliminations or cuts the Trump administration is proposing to state grants, programs to clean up major waterways and grants to clean up diesel pollution.\n\n\u201cStates rely heavily on these funds,\u201d Calvert said of the state grants.\n\nCalvert only alluded briefly to Pruitt\u2019s spending and ethics scandals.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to provide necessary oversight to ensure that EPA and other agencies under this subcommittee\u2019s jurisdiction are held accountable, remain good stewards of the taxpayer\u2019s dollars and comply with congressional notification requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EPA was charged with violating a legal requirement to notify Calvert\u2019s committee before exceeding a $5,000 cap on furnishing Pruitt\u2019s office when it built a $43,000 soundproof booth for Pruitt.\n\nThe panel\u2019s leading Democrat also focused mostly on criticizing Pruitt over his proposed budget cuts.\n\n\u201cThe FY [fiscal] 2019 EPA budget is reckless, it\u2019s irresponsible, and it\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d said Rep. Betty McCollum (Minn.), the subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nMcCollum, who lived directly under Pruitt when he rented a Capitol Hill condo from a lobbyist for just $50 per night he spent there, also criticized the EPA head over ethics.\n\n\u201cIn just one year as EPA administrator, you have violated the public trust by abusing EPA resources and taxpayer dollars,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cYour decisions and actions have displayed a disregard for the ethical standards to which all public officials should adhere.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Timothy Cama\n\nSecond Pruitt hearing gavels in\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nRep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) opened up EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's second House hearing of the day.\n\nCalvert, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on environment, started the hearing telling Pruitt of worries he had concerning the administrator's suggested budget cuts for the EPA for fiscal 2019.\n\n\"Cuts of this magnitude will severely impact our ability to meet statutory requirements,\" said Calvert.\n\nHe ended saying he found Pruitt's other commitments, such as fixing Superfunds, \"A promising improvement.\"\n\n\u2013 Miranda Green\n\nFirst hearing comes to a close\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nRep.

Several noted that they hoped to focus on policy questions.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nGOP rep takes on Pruitt\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nRep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) expressed a variety of concerns over Pruitt\u2019s scandals and endorsed some Democratic criticisms.\n\n\u201cI think the opprobrium that you\u2019ve generated on some of these spending decisions is actually warranted. I\u2019ve reviewed your answers and I find some of them lacking or insufficient,\u201d Costello told Pruitt.\n\n\u201cI believe you\u2019ve not demonstrated the requisite degree of good judgment required of an appointed executive branch official on some of these spending items.\u201d\n\nCostello, who is leaving Congress after this year and not running for reelection, also brought up Pruitt taking his security detail on personal trips.\n\n\u201cWhen folks read about trips to Disneyland, professional basketball games, the Rose Bowl, and the additional security detail related to that, that doesn\u2019t sit well with a lot of people,\u201d Costello said.\n\nPruitt defended the privacy booth by repeating his earlier claim that career employees at EPA made all of the decisions regarding it, not him.\n\nAs for the security, Pruitt said the EPA\u2019s inspector general has investigated various death threats against him and that those threats justify the security measures.\n\n\u201cThese are threats the IG has documented,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThe IG has said that threats to me as administrator are unprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Timothy Cama\n\nPruitt defends need for his additional security\n\n12:46 p.m.\n\nThe EPA chief defended his need for increased security measures, which include a 24/7 security detail and a vehicle with bulletproof seat covers, because of \u201cdocumented\u201d threats.\n\nScott Pruitt cited two examples from an Inspector General report on his \"threat investigation\u201d for why he needs a round-the-clock security detail and has routinely flown first class during travel for business.\n\nThe two examples Pruitt read were verbal threats made to Pruitt and his family.\n\nOne, Pruitt said, read: \u201cPruitt I\u2019m going to find you and put a bullet through your eyes, don\u2019t think I'm joking, I\u2019m planning this.\u201d\n\nAnother incident cited in the report seemingly mentioned a threat made to Pruitt\u2019s daughter McKenna.\n\n\u201cThreats were directed towards her father, \u2018I hope your father dies soon, suffering as your mother watches in horror watching for hours on end,\u2019\u201d Pruitt read.\n\nRep.

Costello launches lobbying shop Head of Pennsylvania GOP resigns over alleged explicit texts Lobbying world MORE (R-Pa.) said the public was having a hard time swallowing Pruitt\u2019s need for security detail at outings such as one he made to Disneyland.\n\n\u201cWhen folks read about trips to Disneyland, professional basketball games, the Rose Bowl, and the additional security detail needed for that, that doesn\u2019t sit well with people,\u201d Costello said.\n\nPruitt promised that he\u2019d provide Costello with the IG report saying they found the threats against him were \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Miranda Green\n\nDem rep tears into Pruitt: \u2018This is not dodge question day\u2019\n\n12:47 p.m.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) tore into Pruitt for his evasiveness on questions about ethics controversies.\n\n\u201cYou have a solid record of breaking ethics rules from the state level up to the federal government. I think it\u2019s an embarrassment to our country and I think it\u2019s offensive to constituents,\u201d she said, asking the administrator if he had any remorse for his spending habits.\n\n\u201cI echo your comments. I think that what you said is absolutely true about the public trust and I endeavor to live in a way that respects that,\u201d Pruitt said, as Eshoo attempted to cut in to emphasize her question.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to outtalk me,\u201d she said.\n\nShe then asked if Pruitt planned to reimburse taxpayers for any of his travel costs, noting he took several flights back to his home state of Oklahoma in the last year.\n\nPruitt responded that the government had cleared those trips as official business.\n\n\u201cI may be elected but I\u2019m not a fool,\u201d Eshoo responded. \u201cThat\u2019s really a lousy answer from somebody who has a high position in the federal government. I mean, this is not dodge question day.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nPruitt promises to protect EPA whistleblowers\n\n12:22 p.m.\n\nPruit promised that EPA employee whistleblowers will be protected.\n\nIn response to a question from Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Pruitt said whistleblower protections were \"absolutely\" something he could commit to.\n\nWhile Pruitt said \u201cthere are no actions we\u2019ve taken, that I\u2019m aware of\u201d regarding assigning employees based on their criticism, he said he takes whistleblowers seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is not one of those situations, but absolutely that is something I can commit to you and will commit to you,\u201d Pruitt told Harper. \u201cAbsolutely, I think that\u2019s how we get better. I think that\u2019s how we improve outcomes and processes.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Miranda Green\n\nPruitt: I didn\u2019t approve $43,000 privacy booth\n\n12:10 p.m.\n\nPruitt told lawmakers that had played almost no role in approving the $43,000 privacy booth for his office.\n\nThe EPA head said he requested a secure phone line, but blamed career employees at the agency for what it became: a $43,000 soundproof booth on par with the kind used for classified information communications.\n\n\u201cI did have a phone call that came in, of a sensitive nature, and I did not have access to secure communications. I gave direction to my staff to address that,\u201d Pruitt said when Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-Calif.) asked about it.\n\n\u201cAnd out of that came a $43,000 expenditure that I did not approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareer individuals at the agency took that process through and signed off on it all the way through,\u201d Pruitt continued. \u201cI was not involved in the approval of the $43,000, and if I\u2019d known about it, congressman, I would have refused it.\u201d\n\nC\u00e1rdenas didn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThat seems a bit odd,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something happens in my office, especially to the degree of $43,000, I know about it before, during and after.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Timothy Cama\n\nRep.

Diana DeGette Diana Louise DeGetteTrump health chief declines to detail ObamaCare replacement plan A dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal FDA under pressure to move fast on vaping MORE (D-Colo.) told EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt during her questioning that her intent was not personal.\n\nFollowing a line of questioning about an Oklahoma property, which Pruitt purchased a one-sixth share in, DeGette told Pruitt, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to hassle you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause as elected officials and appointed officials we have the public trust,\u201d she continued. \u201cEverything we do has to be to the highest ethical standards \u2014 as you just agreed with me, and when we have these transactions it brings disrespect to us as public officials.\u201d\n\nDeGette\u2019s time was cut off shortly after.\n\n\u2014 Miranda Green\n\nPruitt: EPA lawyers said privacy booth was legal\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt blamed agency lawyers for the controversy over his $43,000 soundproof privacy booth, saying that the attorneys believed it was legal.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office ruled last week that the expenditures were illegal. Congress put a $5,000 cap on expenses to furnish or decorate agency heads\u2019 offices, though it can be exceeded if the agency notifies Congress, a step that the EPA didn\u2019t take.\n\nRep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) repeatedly asked if Pruitt knew that the booth expenditures were illegal.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel \u201chas indicated, again, that their opinion is that it\u2019s not a violation,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nDeGette tried to find out if Pruitt or his staff knew that the booth was illegal, but Pruitt repeated that the counsel\u2019s office thought it was illegal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t filibuster, sir,\u201d the congresswoman responded.\n\nDeGette also asked if the EPA would punish anybody for the violation.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating this internally with appropriate individuals both here as well as the inspector general,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nPruitt has justified the booth by saying that he needs to be able to have secure phone conversations with parties like the White House. It is not a certified sensitive compartmentalized information facility, a certification for facilities used to view or communicate classified information.\n\n\u2014 Timothy Cama\n\nPruitt grilled on EPA employee\u2019s \u2018appearances of bias\u2019\n\n11:06 a.m.\n\nRep.

David McKinley David Bennett McKinleyBipartisan former EPA chiefs say Trump administration has abandoned agency's mission Thirty-four GOP members buck Trump on disaster bill Divisions emerge over House drug price bills MORE (R-W.Va.) opened his questioning by criticizing Democrats for focusing on Pruitt\u2019s ethics controversies rather than policy.\n\nHe called Democratic rhetoric \u201ca classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that unfortunately ... I think works against civility and respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we would be able to stay on policy as much as we could but some I see just can\u2019t resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand,\u201d he added.\n\nMcKinley went on to praise Pruitt\u2019s work thus far, noting that the EPA approved a grant to study issues with the drinking water in Flint, Mich., and called its policies \u201cgood for the environment.\u201d\n\nRep. Joe Barton Joe Linus BartonLongtime GOP aide to launch lobbying shop Katie Hill resignation reignites push for federal 'revenge porn' law Shimkus says he's been asked to reconsider retirement MORE (R-Texas) suggested that Pruitt is a victim of \u201cWashington politics,\u201d where opponents of an administration's policy tend to attack a Cabinet member personally.\n\n\u201cRepublicans do it when it\u2019s a Democratic president, Democrats do it when it\u2019s a Republican president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nProtesters hold \u2018Mr. Corruption\u2019 signs behind Pruitt\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nA handful of protesters at the hearing hoisted small signs labeling EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt \u201cMr. Corruption,\u201d with Pruitt\u2019s portrait, behind him.\n\nIt was the first sign of protest within the hearing room at the blockbuster event. Groups of protesters also greeted Pruitt outside the Rayburn House Office Building when he arrived in the morning.\n\nRep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), the hearing chairman, threatened to have the protesters removed, but they were allowed to stay.\n\n\u201cI have some magic words that will then cause you to have to leave. I do not want to say that,\u201d he said.\n\nCapitol Police officers told the protesters to take the signs down and warned them that if they came up again, the protesters would be removed.

I strongly disagree with that. I think your actions are an embarrassment to Mr. Trump,\u201d Pallone said.\n\n\u201cIf I were the president I wouldn\u2019t want your help. I\u2019d just get rid of you,\u201d he added.\n\nPallone first questioned Pruitt about allegations he retaliated against employees who disagreed with him and whether he received death threats.\n\nHe later moved on to questions about the agency\u2019s policies toward certain chemicals but was largely dismissive of Pruitt\u2019s answers.\n\nPruitt attempted to provide explanations, but Pallone said he was seeking \u201cyes or no\u201d responses that Pruitt was unwilling to provide. The congressman suggested the administrator was not interested in taking responsibility for his agency\u2019s practices.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nPruitt says he didn\u2019t know details about controversial raises\n\n10:40 a.m.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt didn\u2019t deny that he knew about controversial raises given to two aides, but he said he wasn\u2019t aware of the amounts of the raises, nor that his staff bypassed the usual White House approval process.\n\nThe EPA gave big raises to Millan Hupp and Sarah Greenwalt, two longtime aides of Pruitt\u2019s who came to the EPA with him from Oklahoma. The agency used a special authority to give the raises after the White House rejected Pruitt\u2019s request.\n\nRep.
