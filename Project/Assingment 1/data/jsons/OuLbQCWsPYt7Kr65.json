Obama went so far as to declare that `` the embargo 's going to end , '' though he could n't say when .\nIn an extraordinary sign of the shifting attitudes , Castro was willing to answer one question on why his regime was keeping Cubans incarcerated for expressing anti-government views . But his response only underscored the schisms between himself and Obama .\n`` Did you ask if we had political prisoners ? Give me a list of political prisoners and I will release them immediately , '' Castro said defensively when asked by CNN 's Jim Acosta why his government was incarcerating dissidents .\nUnaccustomed to press conferences , Castro at first appeared confused at whether the question was directed to him and later asked for it to be repeated as he juggled the headphones he wore to hear its translation .\nLater , Castro delivered a litany of areas where he said the U.S. was failing , from inadequate health care to lower pay for women . He ended the unprecedented question-and-answer session after a second inquiry on human rights , saying he 'd said `` enough . ''\nObama , meanwhile , appeared to relish putting Castro on the spot , winking at the assembled journalists when it appeared Castro was n't going to answer his question .\nIn his own message on human rights , Obama defended his decision to come to Cuba even as government dissent is punished .\n`` We have decades of profound differences , '' Obama said when asked what his message on human rights was during his `` frank conversation '' on the issue with Castro . `` I told President Castro that we are moving forward and not looking backwards . ''\n`` We will continue to stand up for basic principles that we believe in , '' said Obama , who at points insisted that Castro answer the questions posed to him by American journalists . `` America believes in democracy . We believe that freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , are not just American values but universal values . ''\nObama was speaking following an hours-long meeting with Castro at the Palace of the Revolution in Old Havana , his third meeting with the Cuban leader since work began to reopen diplomatic ties to the island .\nCastro , making a statement before the reporters ' questions , said that work toward improving economic conditions in his country was progressing . But he added that a longstanding trade embargo prevents a full restoration of ties .\n`` Much more could be done if the U.S. blockade could be lifted , '' Castro said . `` The most recent measures adopted by his administration are positive but insufficient . ''\nObama agreed that the restrictions would eventually be removed , adding that , `` The path that we 're on will continue beyond my administration . The reason is logic . ''\nObama started his morning laying a wreath by the Jose Marti memorial , a massive monument to the Cuban revolutionary leader where a Cuban military band played the `` Star Spangled Banner , '' another in a series of previously unthinkable moments that marks this week 's visit .\nThe sight of a sitting American president setting foot on the island was a novelty for most Cubans . The last U.S. leader to visit was Calvin Coolidge , who voyaged into Havana Harbor on a battleship in 1928 .\nIn an elaborate welcome ceremony , Obama and Castro met with smiles and brief conversation before moving down long hallways lined with Cuban troops . Obama was overheard telling the Cuban leader he enjoyed his tour of Havana Sunday night along with his family .\nHe also told Castro he had a `` great '' dinner at a `` paladar '' -- one of hundreds of privately run restaurants that only recently became permissible in the state-run economy . Those types of businesses , along with new investments from American firms , give U.S. officials hope that Cuba is on a path to open its economy after decades of isolation .\nThe meeting provides Obama and his aides another reality check on their mission to extract reforms from Castro . Until this point , there have been few signs that the government here is willing to work as quickly as the Obama administration hoped in opening the state-run economy and improving human rights .\nThe vast differences between the Obama administration and the Castro regime were no less evident Sunday as Havana hurried to prepare for the U.S. president 's arrival . As Obama was en route , scores of anti-Castro dissidents from the group Ladies in White were arrested and detained after their weekly protest in Havana . CNN witnessed dozens of protesters being driven from the site in buses .\nThe group consists largely of women who have been arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against the government here .\nJose Daniel Ferrer , a Cuban dissident who was imprisoned for eight years beginning in 2008 , said Obama could harness the attention from his trip to make a loud demand for political reform , citing President Ronald Reagan 's demand in 1987 for the Soviet Union to `` tear down this wall . ''\nBut Ferrer , speaking with CNN in his home Sunday , conceded that even incremental change is beneficial to the island 's politically oppressed citizenry .\n`` It 's a support gesture , it 's a solidarity gesture for the struggle that we are taking forward , '' he said . `` In Cuba we have to tear down many walls so that the Cuban people can live with dignity , with rights , and so that they can prosper .

Here are other world leaders, religious figures and big-time celebrities who have been to the Caribbean island. Hide Caption 1 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba Shortly after being released from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandela visited Cuba and shook hands with Castro. Castro and Mandela were friends. In 1994, when Mandela became the first black President of South Africa, Castro was a guest of honor at his inauguration.

Hide Caption 3 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba After the collapse of the Soviet Union, no Russian leader visited Cuba until 2000, when President Vladimir Putin traveled to the island to meet with Castro. Putin returned in 2014, meeting with Castro and his brother Raul. \"Cooperation with the Latin American nations is one of the key orientations and prospects of Russian foreign policy,\" Putin said afterward. Hide Caption 4 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was one of Fidel Castro's closest allies. Their friendship spanned almost two decades. Chavez visited Cuba for the first time in 1994, shortly after his release from jail for his involvement in a failed government coup. Chavez visited Cuba many times in the years after that visit. He also received medical treatment on the island until his death in 2013. Hide Caption 5 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba Cuba has hosted multiple visits by Iranian heads of state.

During his visit, the Pope told the audience that he sought to emphasize \"the importance of faith,\" highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the island nation. Hide Caption 9 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba No Pope has been to the island more times than Pope Francis. Even though he has been the leader of the Catholic Church for less than three years, Pope Francis has already visited Cuba twice. His first visit was in 2015. Francis called on the communist nation to \"open itself to the world,\" while praising its recent restoration of diplomatic ties with the United States. In 2016, Cuba served as a backdrop to the first meeting between the heads of the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches since the Great Schism in 1054.

Rapper Jay Z and his wife, pop star Beyonce, caused a stir during their trip to the island in 2013. Their visit was so heavily criticized that the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General had to get involved. The Treasury Department deemed their trip did not violate any U.S. sanctions laws that were in place during the visit. Hide Caption 11 of 15 Photos: Illustrious visitors to Cuba American movie director Steven Spielberg spent four days in Cuba in 2002. The trip, which had been authorized by the U.S. government as a cultural exchange, served as a way for the filmmaker to showcase some of his movies and meet with some Cuban filmmakers. Spielberg also dined with Fidel Castro, discussing arts, politics and history.

In 2015, it was a letter to Maradona that quelled rumors the Cuban leader had passed away.
