    "content": "Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Sunday cast herself as President Obama \u2019 s natural heir on guns , health care and the economy in the final debate before Iowa \u2019 s caucuses , but Sen. Bernard Sanders said it \u2019 s time for Democrats to push further , saying the country needs a \u201c political revolution \u201d to break the power of big corporations .\nMrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of betraying Mr. Obama by seeking a primary opponent for him in 2012 , and calling the president weak on tackling Wall Street . And she said Mr. Sanders \u2018 new plan for government-sponsored universal health care would undo the advances of Obamacare , which she said she would defend and expand .\nMr. Sanders denied that he \u2019 s an enemy of Mr. Obama , but embraced the charge that he wants to move beyond the president \u2019 s agenda , saying more must be done to break the power big banks and the wealthiest have over Washington .\n\u201c Can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals ? \u201d he said , pointing to $ 200,000 he said Mrs. Clinton collected in 2013 to deliver a speech at investment giant Goldman Sachs .\n\u201c It \u2019 s easy to say I \u2019 m going to do this and do that , but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street , \u201d he said .\nFacing off in Charleston , South Carolina , in a prime-time debate aired on NBC , the candidates \u2014 with former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley rounding out the field \u2014 drew some of their sharpest distinctions year , with the surging Mr. Sanders facing increasing scrutiny over his past stances and future plans .\nMrs. Clinton came out swinging at the top of the debate , saying Mr. Sanders has benefited from help from the National Rifle Association , and that makes it impossible for him to pass gun control .\n\u201c He has voted with the NRA , with the gun lobby , numerous times , \u201d she said . \u201c He voted for immunity for gunmakers and sellers . There is no industry in America that was given the total pass the gunmakers and gun dealers were , and that needs to be reversed . \u201d\nMr. Sanders , however , said he has a D-minus rating from the NRA , and said he can be the bridge-builder the country needs on the issue .\nHe \u2019 s taken heat for his 2005 vote to grant gun manufacturers immunity from liability lawsuits . Over the weekend he said he would now support legislation to eliminate that liability , and at the debate Sunday he said he \u201c will support stronger provisions. \u201d He also said Mrs. Clinton is politicizing the issue .\n\u201c This should not be a political issue , \u201d he said . \u201c What we should be doing is working together , and , by the way , as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control , I believe I am in an excellent position to bring people together . \u201d\nFor his part , Mr. O \u2019 Malley said neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Sanders has led on gun control .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue , \u201d he said , arguing he \u2019 s got a track record of winning strict gun control legislation from the legislature during his eight years as governor .\nWhile Mr. Sanders was the focus of the debate , Mr. Obama \u2019 s shadow loomed large \u2014 particularly after his Tuesday State of the Union address , where he looked beyond this year \u2019 s policy fights and tried to lay out the philosophical decisions that face voters in November .\nMrs. Clinton sought to cloak herself in his calls to surmount political divisions , saying she will be the unifying president the country needs .\n\u201c I would be working in every way that I knew to bring our country together . We do have too much division , too much mean-spiritedness , \u201d she said . \u201c We need to do it together . \u201d\nMr. Sanders , though , said he \u2019 s hoping to lead a \u201c political revolution \u201d in the U.S. that would challenge the power he said the wealthy and big corporations have over politics .\n\u201c This campaign is about a political revolution , not only to elect a president but to transform this country , \u201d said Mr. Sanders , a self-described socialist who caucuses with the Democrats in the U.S. Senate .\nMr. O \u2019 Malley almost didn \u2019 t make the stage for the debate , with his polling in Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and nationally falling below the 5 percent threshold of support NBC had set for participants .
