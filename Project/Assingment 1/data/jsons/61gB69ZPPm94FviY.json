And the challenge is further complicated by wide-ranging variations in adoption of and adherence to preventative measures like social distancing and voluntary home quarantine .\n\u201c I think we should use all data to inform our views , but we shouldn \u2019 t be overconfident in the results from any one data set or even any combination of data sets , \u201d says Marc Lipsitch , a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H .

[ people ] read the numbers through these narratives , through these stories , \u201d says John Ioannidis , a professor of epidemiology at Stanford University . Such packaging in the media compounds an already stressful environment , he adds , noting that stress affects susceptibility to viral and respiratory infections . \u201c In such a situation , with panic and horror being disseminated , I think we could be doing a lot of harm . \u201d\nTwo of the most prominent COVID-19 models are from Imperial College London and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) in Washington state .\nImperial \u2019 s Neil Ferguson and his colleagues garnered headlines with their projection that if nothing were done , COVID-19 deaths in the United Kingdom and U.S. over two years would total 510,000 and 2.2 million , respectively , and demand for critical care beds would peak at 30 times actual capacity .\nTheir March 16 report , which advocated social distancing , is widely credited with prompting Britain and many U.S. states to close schools , churches , and nonessential services . The Trump administration issued guidance the same day recommending that employees work at home and gatherings be limited to 10 or fewer people .\nDr. Ferguson , who is one of the most highly respected figures in his field , came under fire for allegedly reversing course nine days later when he told British Parliament that due to the U.K. \u2019 s lockdown and social distancing policies , he estimated the death toll at 20,000 and possibly substantially less .\nThe 20,000 estimate was in fact included in the original report \u2013 but as one of 46 different projected death tolls ranging from 5,600 to 120,000 depending on the rate of transmission and the scope of societal restrictions . ( See page 13 in this PDF . )\nIt \u2019 s unclear how effective such restrictions are . A survey of 14 studies on quarantine in past disease outbreaks , for example , found that rates of adherence varied from 0 % to 92 % .\n\u201c I think we need to be very careful with narratives that say ... \u2018 Only 20,000 died because we did the right thing , \u2019 \u201d says Dr. Ioannidis , who has made a career out of finding holes in medical research and cautions against a \u201c bandwagon \u201d effect among researchers .\nLast month he published a provocative article in STAT warning of a once-in-a-century \u201c evidence fiasco \u201d around COVID-19 , asking how policymakers could be sure they weren \u2019 t doing more harm than good by implementing draconian countermeasures based on patchy data . Dr. Lipsitch wrote a rebuttal piece arguing that despite the lack of data , inaction was not an option given the exponential nature of infection .\nOne of the key unknowns is the infection fatality rate . Under ideal circumstances , fatality rates are a matter of simple arithmetic \u2013 divide the number of deaths by the number of infections . But without widespread testing of the general population , it \u2019 s difficult to produce a reliable denominator .

But more recent estimates have come in lower . A March 13 article in the journal Science , for example , concluded that China \u2019 s fatality rate was closer to 0.5 % . Imperial \u2019 s study put the U.K. rate at 0.9 % .\nThe other model garnering a lot of attention , from IHME at the University of Washington , didn \u2019 t attempt to calculate fatality rates . It focused on projecting total deaths and the strain on health care systems , initially using data from Wuhan , China , and then other locations as more data became available .\nIHME \u2019 s March 25 forecast projected lower death tolls than numerous other models \u2013 in part because it assumed that within one week , all U.S. states would have adopted four social distancing measures that China implemented . But two weeks later , 41 states have implemented two or fewer . Nevertheless , IMHE has since reduced its projections to 60,415 U.S. deaths by August , and lowered its estimate of total hospital beds needed at peak demand by nearly half .\nJohn Locher/AP Medical students Claire Chen ( center left ) and Miranda Stiewig ( center right ) take people 's temperatures to screen for possible coronavirus cases at a makeshift camp for homeless people on March 28 , 2020 , in Las Vegas .\nSo how are public officials supposed to make sense of the debate within the scientific community \u2013 and fast ?\nIdeally , their scientific advisers can help sort through the relevant studies or models , including the fine print , says John Holdren , former White House scientific adviser under President Barack Obama .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the responsibility of the modelers [ individuals and their agencies ] to make the assumptions and associated uncertainties clear when they describe their results , and the responsibility of science advisors to policy makers to try to make sure these points are understood , \u201d says Dr. Holdren in an emailed comment .\nThe Trump administration showed IMHE \u2019 s model at a March 31 press conference when it unveiled its own estimate of 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities , also citing studies from Imperial College , Harvard , and others .
