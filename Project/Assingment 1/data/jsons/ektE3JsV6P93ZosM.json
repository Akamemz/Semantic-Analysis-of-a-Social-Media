NSA ruling fallout hits White House\nIn legal terms , a federal judge \u2019 s decision Monday questioning the constitutionality of the National Security Agency \u2019 s massive call-tracking program seems almost certain to have no practical significance .\nIn political terms , it comes at a critical time for the NSA and President Barack Obama .\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon \u2019 s ruling that the NSA \u2019 s metadata program appears to violate the Fourth Amendment was issued just three days after a review group established by Obama delivered its report proposing more than 40 changes to the federal government \u2019 s surveillance programs .\nObama was initially expected to dig through the reform proposals before Christmas and announce which ones he would adopt . However , the White House now says that process won \u2019 t be complete until sometime next month .\nThe delay gives Leon \u2019 s decision time to resonate and gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama to endorse significant reforms after Edward Snowden \u2019 s revelations about NSA surveillance practices .\nThe ruling also underscores the awkwardness of a president who won office in part by railing against the national security state established by President George W. Bush trying to defend much of that establishment while maintaining his vow to restore civil liberties and bring an end to what seemed like a permanent war on terror .\nLeon said his decision would not take effect while it is being appealed , which he said was inevitable . And with at least three other lawsuits related to the metadata program in the works , the issue seems highly likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court .
