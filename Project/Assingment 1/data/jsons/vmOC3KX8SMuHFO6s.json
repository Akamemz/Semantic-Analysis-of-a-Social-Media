No sooner had Trump finished the State of the Union Address \u2014 a speech that could have been delivered by any Democrat before the radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s seeped into the party \u2014 than CNN was throwing a wet blanket on it . \u201c There will be Democrats offended by the speech , \u201d intoned Jake Tapper . \u201c He was selling sweet candy with poison in it , \u201d chipped in Van Jones .\nWhat is the sound of one aisle clapping at the most basic and blameless expressions of nationalism , the nationalism that every functioning country on earth observes ? Americans heard it Tuesday night . The Democrats couldn \u2019 t clap for the flag or fighting gangs ( that elicited a groan from some of them ) . It couldn \u2019 t clap for the national anthem , secure borders , religious liberty , even vocational training . It saw poison everywhere , though they did perk up at Trump \u2019 s mention of second chances for criminals .\nThe Democrats have become the foreigners first party . Notice that one of the two official Democratic responses was in Spanish . The other one was delivered by Rep. Joe Kennedy III , whose digressions about \u201c transgenderism \u201d would have even confused his forbears . He too broke into a little Spanish during his response , before endorsing the open borders anarchism of La Raza . He approvingly quoted illegal immigrants who promised to \u201c tear down \u201d any future walls .\nTrump \u2019 s speech contained few ideological edges . But Tapper , a former Democratic staffer , saw parts of the speech as \u201c holding up a fist. \u201d Other commentators , desperate to find something to attack in the speech , pronounced it \u201c flat \u201d and questioned its \u201c cadence. \u201d They liked that he larded it with a rainbow of \u201c inspirational stories , \u201d but turned their noses up at its policy ambitions , even though many of them ( paid family leave and amnesty for Dreamers ) represented substantial concessions to the Democrats .\nBefore the Democrats took their McGovernite turn , they would have agreed with almost everything in Trump \u2019 s speech and would have stood for much of it . Now it is a party of stale and geriatric radicalism . ( Even Joe Kennedy III sounded like a young old fogey , delivering a speech that could have been written by George McGovern and Bernie Sanders . ) And so the Democrats sulked through much of the speech . They fiddled with their phones and rolled their eyes even at the most banal lines . The black caucus slouched through Trump \u2019 s tribute to historic levels of black employment .\nBefore the speech , CNN treated the boycotting Democrats gingerly and sympathetically , even raising the question of whether mere attendance constituted \u201c normalizing \u201d Trump . It didn \u2019 t treat those Democrats as extreme but worthy of a serious hearing .\nWhen not debating that matter solemnly , CNN indulged in some leering speculation about the Trump marriage .

Much was made of Melania traveling \u201c separately \u201d to the speech . That she was hosting a pre-speech reception with Pence \u2019 s wife didn \u2019 t suffice as an explanation . \u201c They are traveling separately on multiple fronts , \u201d one of the anchors asserted . So much for the media \u2019 s old rules about the tastelessness of probing presidential families . It is open season on the Trumps . All of the insinuating comments about Melania were couched in faux-respectful language ( she is more popular than her husband , Wolf Blitzer hastened to add , as if that gave a certain dignity to the otherwise gossipy tone of the segment ) , but I doubt she found any of it flattering .\nBut the most forlorn attendee was Joe Manchin , who spent much of the speech standing alone .
