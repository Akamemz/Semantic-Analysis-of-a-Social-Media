He made a graphic statement about needing some weapons and the difficulties he \u2019 s having with those , and we will be signing a letter this morning , and as I said it would require some legislation , but are you aware of the problems Jordanians are having with acquiring some of the weapons that they need ? \u201d ( SOUNDBITE ) ( English ) DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE ASHTON CARTER SAYING : \u201c I \u2019 m not Mr. chairman , I learned of them this morning as well , and if I \u2019 m confirmed I definitely want to find out what they are and resolve them because we need partners of the ground to beat ISIS . And the Jordanian people have clearly reacted the way that encourages us to support them. \u201d ( SOUNDBITE ) ( English ) DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE ASHTON CARTER SAYING : \u201c A strategy connects , ends and means , and our ends with respects to ISIL needs to be its lasting defeat . I say \u2018 lasting \u2019 because it \u2019 s important that when they get defeated they stay defeated . And that is why it \u2019 s important that we have those on the ground there who will ensure that they stay defeated , once defeated . It \u2019 s different on the two sides of the border . It \u2019 s one enemy , it \u2019 s two different contexts . Mr. chairman , in Iraq , the force that will keep them defeated is the Iraqi security forces , that \u2019 s our strategy , is to strengthen them and to make them that force . On the Syrian side , not to take too long about it , we are trying to build the force that will keep them defeated . And that \u2019 s going to be a combination of moderate Syrian forces and regional forces. \u201d ARIZONA REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN SAYING : \u201c Do you believe we should be supplying arms , defensive arms , to Ukrainians ? \u201d ( SOUNDBITE ) ( English ) DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE ASHTON CARTER SAYING : \u201c I \u2019 m very much inclined in that direction , Mr. chairman , because I think we need to support the Ukrainians in defending themselves . The nature of those arms I can \u2019 t say right now , because I don \u2019 t have , haven \u2019 t conferred with our military leaders , or Ukrainian leaders . But I incline in the direction of providing them arms , including to get to what I \u2019 m sure your question is , legal arms . \u201d",
