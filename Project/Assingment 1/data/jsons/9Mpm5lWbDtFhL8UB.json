'' Well , today Enten is back with an interesting piece headlined `` Gary Johnson Is n't Fading . ''\nWhile noting what we have been warning you about here for years\u2014third-party candidates typically see their crest of polling support halved by Election Day , according to Gallup\u2014Enten explains that Johnson 's numbers have so far not followed this pattern . In fact , the Libertarian may have already weathered the most difficult part of the calendar : `` Most third-party candidates did n't lose that much support between late summer and Election Day , '' Enten writes . `` Besides John Anderson in 1980 , no candidate ended up finishing more than 3 percentage points below where they were polling in late August .
