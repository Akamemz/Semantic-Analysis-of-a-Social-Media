    "content": "\u201c I grew up in the inner city , so I understand the issues of poverty and violence , drugs and gangs , and even rodents in the inner city , \u201d Mr. Polanco says . \u201c But it \u2019 s one thing to point that out , and to talk about solutions to solve those issues , and it \u2019 s another thing to use it to disparage people . \u201d\n\u201c President Trump \u2019 s words over the past two weeks have been very polarizing , \u201d says Juan Carlos \u201c J.C. \u201d Polanco , a New York attorney known as \u201c the Hispanic voice of New York Republicans . \u201d\nThis week \u2019 s spree of attacks shines a spotlight on a long Republican practice of throwing shade at cities , many of them under decadeslong Democratic rule . Mr. Trump \u2019 s supporters say that it \u2019 s not about race \u2013 he \u2019 s just calling out the failures of liberal governance . But even with a strong economy , which would normally put a first-term president in strong position for reelection , Mr. Trump \u2019 s racially divisive rhetoric is already alienating voters in key electoral battlegrounds .\n\u201c He is right , you know , \u201d says the silver-haired septuagenarian , referring to Mr. Trump \u2019 s recent racially tainted fusillades on liberal cities .\nWhen Marilyn Ford points , she might as well be pointing with President Donald Trump \u2019 s finger .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long Thursday night , at a rally in Cincinnati , for President Donald Trump to pull out his favorite punching bag : America \u2019 s big , diverse cities , most of them run by \u201c Democrat politicians \u201d and harmed by \u201c the far left \u2019 s destructive agenda . \u201d\nAs he has all week , President Trump singled out Baltimore . He didn \u2019 t name names , but he didn \u2019 t have to . The president has been punching hard at Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , who represents much of Baltimore \u2013 and whose congressional committee recently approved subpoenas for Mr. Trump \u2019 s daughter and son-in-law . On Friday morning , he tweet-trolled Congressman Cummings over an intruder who entered his Baltimore home last weekend .\nThat Mr. Cummings is African American is lost on no one . And following the president \u2019 s tirades against four minority female freshmen in Congress , known as \u201c the squad , \u201d the politics of race is aflame like at no other time in Mr. Trump \u2019 s presidency .\n\u201c The pattern Trump is following with Elijah Cummings is the same as with the squad , \u201d says Ian Haney L\u00f3pez , a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , and an author of books on the politics of race . \u201c That is , go after a Democratic politician of color and slander them in terms that are highly racialized but that still allow a modicum of deniability . That \u2019 s dog whistle politics . \u201d\nAnd , Mr. Haney says , it could win Mr. Trump reelection by keeping his base supporters energized . But if it turns off enough suburban and blue-collar women who might otherwise support him , particularly in battleground states , the strategy could backfire .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question that in his approach to Cummings , he \u2019 s walking a tightrope , \u201d says GOP strategist Ford O \u2019 Connell . \u201c But at the same time , he can not allow unfettered media coverage to call him racist and a Russian puppet without making the case that the policies that are being prescribed by the very people who are calling him racist have let down Democratic voters and particularly minorities . \u201d\nIndeed , Mr. Trump \u2019 s pitch to African Americans in 2016 was essentially \u201c what have you got to lose ? \u201d And while he won only 8 % of the black vote , that was better than 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney \u2019 s 6 % . Today , Mr. Trump touts criminal justice reform and low African American unemployment in his messaging to black voters .\nBut even with a strong economy , which would normally put a first-term president in strong position for reelection , Mr. Trump \u2019 s racially divisive rhetoric is already alienating voters in key electoral battlegrounds . Take Ann Pigeon , a businesswoman in suburban Atlanta and a fiscal conservative who voted libertarian in 2016 and was willing to consider Mr. Trump in 2020 , until his rhetoric about \u201c rat-infested \u201d Baltimore and warnings over socialism . His comments strike her as desperate attempts to talk past Americans like her .\n\u201c Sure , I care about the economy , but he \u2019 s not the only one who can manage it , \u201d says Ms. Pigeon . \u201c I have given him a chance , I have watched , and I have one answer to whether or not I will give him my vote : hell , no . He has proven himself unworthy . \u201d\nThis week \u2019 s spree of attacks on Mr. Cummings and Baltimore shines a spotlight on a long Republican practice of throwing shade at cities , many of them under decadeslong Democratic rule . Mr. Trump \u2019 s supporters say that it \u2019 s not about race \u2013 he \u2019 s just calling out the failures of liberal governance .\nMr. Trump himself points to a 2015 speech by Sen. Bernie Sanders , in which the social democrat from Vermont compared living conditions in Baltimore to a \u201c third-world country. \u201d The context , however , is completely different . Senator Sanders was denouncing income inequality and linking it to structural racism , not blaming the residents or elected officials .\nIn going after Mr. Cummings , Mr. Trump takes his critique one step further : It \u2019 s the congressman who \u2019 s the racist , not himself . Mr. Haney says this is the classic pattern : Don \u2019 t just play defense , go on offense .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing with the attack on the squad and on Elijah Cummings is a purposeful strategy to make the public face of the Democratic Party people of color , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s how Trump did really well in 2016 , \u201d by running against both President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , \u201c who had a strong racial justice message . \u201d\nMr. Trump \u2019 s rhetorical approach has sparked a range of reactions among Republicans . On Thursday night , late-night TV host Seth Meyers asked Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan , a popular moderate Republican in a blue state , about his \u201c weak \u201d response to Mr. Trump \u2019 s attacks on Baltimore . The governor pleaded for calm .\n\u201c The last thing I need to do is have more angry reaction to the angry reaction , back and forth , \u201d Governor Hogan replied . \u201c Let \u2019 s stop all the tweeting . Let \u2019 s focus on how we \u2019 re going to solve some of these problems by working together . \u201d\nThe GOP is also seeing a wave of retirements by House members , a blow to the party \u2019 s chances of retaking the House next year . Some are explicitly mentioning the rhetorical climate in Washington in their announcements . Among the retirees are two of House Republicans \u2019 13 women members and the party \u2019 s only African American member , Rep. Will Hurd of Texas . Congressman Hurd was one of four House Republicans who voted last month for a resolution denouncing Trump tweets against the squad as racist .\nIn Democrat-dominated New York City , Mayor Bill de Blasio is facing pushback from constituents over his run for president and his plan to open a homeless shelter on \u201c Billionaire \u2019 s Row. \u201d A group bought billboard space in Iowa , where the mayor has been campaigning , that reads , \u201c Hey , Bill de Blasio ! It \u2019 s New York ... Remember Us ? \u201d\nIndeed , the public relations stunt calls attention to a real issue : that homelessness is on the rise in New York \u2013 a city once run by Republican Trump ally Rudy Giuliani \u2013 and that there are legitimate critiques of Democratic rule in American cities , regardless of leaders \u2019 race .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t make life easier for urban Republicans in the Trump era .\n\u201c I think President Trump \u2019 s words over the past two weeks have been very polarizing , \u201d says Juan Carlos \u201c J.C. \u201d Polanco , a New York attorney and son of Dominican immigrants who has run for office . He \u2019 s known as \u201c the Hispanic voice of New York Republicans . \u201d\n\u201c I grew up in the inner city , so I understand the issues of poverty and violence , drugs and gangs , and even rodents in the inner city , something that is prevalent , \u201d Mr. Polanco says . \u201c But it \u2019 s one thing to point that out , and to talk about solutions to solve those issues , and it \u2019 s another thing to use it to disparage people , and the people that represent those areas . \u201d\nFor Democrats in New York who are willing to see Mr. Trump with some nuance , any possibility of supporting the president is snuffed out by his rhetoric . Eduardo Giraldo , a small-business owner in Queens and pro-growth Democrat , gives Mr. Trump credit for standing up to China on trade practices . But the president \u2019 s rhetoric toward the squad and black members of Congress , he says , is \u201c racist . \u201d\n\u201c His actions , his words , are really divisive , \u201d says Mr. Giraldo . \u201c He \u2019 s polarizing the country in a very concerning way in a lot of different aspects \u2013 the social aspects of the country , from the political divisions to economics . \u201d\nIn suburban Alpharetta , Georgia , located in the state \u2019 s 6th Congressional District \u2013 which went Democratic last November by a nose \u2013 women voters in particular are being watched for their reactions to Mr. Trump \u2019 s rhetoric . Some , like Ms. Pigeon , see it as a disqualifier . But others think he \u2019 s spot on .\nWhen Marilyn Ford points , she might as well be pointing with President Trump \u2019 s finger .\n\u201c He is right , you know , \u201d says the silver-haired septuagenarian , referring to Mr. Trump \u2019 s recent racially tainted fusillades on liberal cities , which have in the past included Democratic Rep. John Lewis \u2019 urban Atlanta district .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s racist , and I don \u2019 t want to be racist , but I look at these places like Baltimore and I see black politicians lining their pockets . And the crime : There \u2019 s murders every night down in Atlanta. \u201d ( In fact , Atlanta had 93 murders in 2017 , according to the FBI , near historic lows . )\nMs. Ford is a stalwart of these once reliably conservative northern Atlanta suburbs . Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich hatched the Contract With America here , amid the horse farms .\nYet it is a microcosm of the central Trump argument about the failures of Democratic leadership \u2013 particularly black officials like Mr. Lewis and Mr. Cummings .\n\u201c He is standing up to what I think my grandchildren will see and I won \u2019 t be around for , socialism , \u201d she says .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nIt is a battleground where \u201c the shooting would start if they were to impeach him , \u201d Ms. Ford frets . Her friends \u2013 \u201c all old like me \u201d \u2013 agree . Mr. Trump \u2019 s mouth is a growing liability , and upsets her Southern sensibilities . \u201c There \u2019 s no need to be rude to people , \u201d she says . Yet she also appreciates his candor , his directness , his willingness to attack for people like her .\n\u201c I appreciate that he sticks up for us , \u201d she says .",
