    "content": "A former Marine -- armed with a Glock 21 .45-caliber handgun with an illegal extended magazine -- opened fire on a packed California country music bar Wednesday night , killing 12 people , including a veteran sheriff 's sergeant nearing retirement , officials said .\nAuthorities believe Ian David Long eventually turned the gun on himself , but not before the 28-year-old , dressed in all black , terrorized a crowd filled with college students at Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks , Calif. Long 's body was found in an office near the entrance of the bar .\nSheriff Geoff Dean , who is set to retire on Friday , said Long may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and was known to law enforcement officials due to several unspecified `` contacts '' stretching back multiple years . Long served in the Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013 , with a deployment in Afghanistan between November 2010 and June 2011 , military records show .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had several contacts with Mr. Long over the years , minor events such as a traffic collision . He was a victim of a battery in a bar in 2015 , \u201d Dean said , adding that the bar in 2015 was a different establishment than Borderline .\nDean said the last interaction between Long and authorities occurred in April , when police officers were called to Long 's house in Newbury Park , about five miles from Borderline , after reports of a disturbance . When they arrived , officers found Long `` irate and acting irrationally , '' leading to a crisis intervention team being summoned . The team , however , cleared Long and said they did n't feel he was qualified to be taken into custody .\n\u201c Obviously , he had something going on in his head that would cause him to do something like this . Obviously , he had some sort of issue , \u201d Dean said of Long .\nAs for why he attacked the bar , `` there 's no indication that he targeted the employees . We have n't found any correlation , '' the sheriff said . `` Maybe there was a motive for this particular night , but we have no information leading to that at all . ''\nLong opened fire inside Borderline about 11:20 p.m. , during the bar 's `` college country night '' event , authorities said . Dean said it appears Long shot the unarmed security guard first , turned to the right to shoot other security and staff members before opening fire on the rest of the patrons . No one at the venue was armed .\nAbout 150 to 200 people \u2014 including 16 students from private Christian school Pepperdine University , along with others from California Lutheran University and California State University Channel Islands \u2014 were inside Borderline when witnesses said Long tossed a smoke device into the crowd and then , amid the confusion , fired at least 30 shots .\nDeputies and highway patrolmen arrived at the bar within minutes of receiving multiple 911 calls and began assessing the grim , gruesome situation , Sheriff Geoff Dean said during an earlier Thursday news conference .\n\u201c It is a horrific scene in there . There is blood everywhere , \u201d Dean said . He later described it as `` hell . ''\nSheriff 's Sgt . Ron Helus , a veteran of 29 years , arrived first on the scene and immediately entered the bar with a patrolman after hearing gunfire . But as the two made their way inside , Helus was shot several times . The patrolman pulled the sergeant from the line of fire , and Helus was taken to a local hospital , where he was pronounced dead early Thursday .\n`` Ron was a hardworking , dedicated sheriff sergeant , '' Dean said while holding back tears . `` He was totally committed . He gave his all . And tonight , as I told his wife , he died a hero because he went in to save lives . To save other people . ''\nWitnesses inside the bar -- which bills itself as `` Ventura County 's largest country dance hall and live music venue '' -- told reporters how some patrons used chairs to break windows in a bid to escape the chaos while others scrambled between shots to hide in the establishment 's attic . Dean said people also hid in the attic , bathroom and under tables to escape the hail of bullets .\nThere were six off-duty officers at the bar that night .\n`` It 's just amazing . There were probably six off-duty officers in there from a couple different agencies and I 've already talked to a parent who said they stood in front of my daughter , '' Dean said .\nOne other person suffered a `` minor gunshot '' wound , while 15 to 20 people were injured by jumping through windows and diving under tables , according to the sheriff . Pepperdine University officials said two of its students were treated for injuries and released . One student who was at the bar remains unaccounted for .\n\u201c We all just kind of froze for a split second and then everyone booked it and dove to the floor , '' said Teylor Whittler , who was on the dance floor when the shooting started . `` After the first round it was quiet for about five seconds , and then some guys who were next to me on the floor got up and started sprinting toward the back door and yelled at everyone , \u2018 Get up ! Run ! He \u2019 s coming ! \u201d\nWhittler , a daughter of a military veteran , told `` Fox & Friends '' she was at the bar celebrating a friend 's 21st birthday when shots rang out . She said of the 11 people she was with , there are still five friends who she has n't heard from yet . She recalled getting trampled on and hit in the head with a barstool when patrons made a dash to the door . A man eventually pulled her up and helped her escape .\nShe described the gunman as wearing all black clothes , a black baseball cap and a ski mask-type item partially covering his face . Several other witnesses offered a similar description , telling reporters the tall gunman first shot at a bouncer working the bar 's door and then opened fire -- seemingly at random -- at those inside .\n\u201c While I was inside I would say [ I heard ] \u2026about a good 30 seconds [ of gunshots ] \u2026he had two [ magazines ] that I know with him . He changed them within about six seconds , which was really fast , \u201d she said .\n\u201c As soon as he walked in he had perfect form\u2026he looked like he knew what he was doing . He had practiced , he had been shooting [ before ] , '' she told `` Fox & Friends . ''\nAside from the college students filling the bar , survivors of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre -- which occurred during a country music festival -- were also in Borderline .\nLAS VEGAS SHOOTING SURVIVORS WERE INSIDE THOUSAND OAK BAR , FRIENDS SAY\nChandler Gunn , 23 , of Newberry Park , said a friend who works at the bar was also at Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 , 2017 , when a gunman fired a barrage of bullets from a hotel room perch , The Los Angeles Times reported .\n`` A lot of people in the Route 91 situation go here , '' Gunn said . `` There 's people that live a whole lifetime without seeing this , and then there \u2019 s people that have seen it twice . ''\nJosh Coaly , 27 , had been to Borderline several times with his friends -- including one who also survived the Vegas shooting , The Times reported . Coaly said the unidentified friend was in good condition .\nCarl Edgar , 24 , of Tarzana , told The Times he had about 20 friends inside the bar , which he also frequents .\n\u201c As far as I know , all of my friends are OK , safe , \u201d he said . \u201c There are a few people we can \u2019 t get a hold of , but in these situations , people usually turn off their phones to be safe so I \u2019 m not gon na get too worried . A lot of my friends survived Route 91 . If they survived that , they \u2019 ll survive this . \u201d\nPresident Trump said he was briefed on the `` terrible shooting '' and offered his condolences to the 12 people who died .\n\u201c I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California .
