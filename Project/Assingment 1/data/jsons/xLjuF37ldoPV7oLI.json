    "content": "The emergence of Tara Reade 's accusation of sexual assault against presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden has prompted the swift and sudden collapse of the # MeToo movement 's central tenet\u2014that all women who come forward with such allegations deserve to be believed .\nIn fact , some who speak for the movement are n't merely retreating on this point : They are pretending that feminists who wielded the # MeToo hashtag never claimed that all women should be believed . This is a transparent attempt to rewrite history and should be treated as such .\nFor a perfect example , see the journalist Susan Faludi in The New York Times : `` 'Believe All Women ' Is a Right-Wing Trap , '' reads the headline on her article . Faludi accuses conservatives of inventing the idea that feminists were demanding that all women be believed . According to her , `` the preferred hashtag of the # MeToo movement is # BelieveWomen . It 's different without the 'all . ' Believing women is simply the rejoinder to the ancient practice of # DoubtWomen . ''\n`` Good luck finding any feminist who thinks we should believe everything all women say\u2014even what they say about sexual assault , '' Faludi continues . This directly contradicts her earlier admittal that she had in fact `` encountered some feminists who seemed genuinely to subscribe '' to the more extreme interpretation of the hashtag .\nFaludi is narrowly right that `` believe women '' was the more popular phrasing among # MeToo activists , and that contrarians were more likely to introduce the word `` all '' as a means of pointing out how silly the concept was . But whether the phrase contains `` all '' is unimportant : It means the same thing , regardless . The command to believe group X is straightforwardly and obviously a plea to have faith in the entire collective entity . Faludi claims in her piece that `` believe women '' is actually the opposite of `` believe all women , '' but this is absurd . She is , to use a term beloved by victims ' rights advocates , gaslighting her readers .\nOne of Faludi 's examples of a sensible `` believe women '' statement getting twisted into a `` believe all women '' attack was Juanita Broaddrick\u2014who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault\u2014calling out Hillary Clinton for hypocrisy . Hillary had tweeted , `` To every survivor of sexual assault \u2026 you have the right to be heard . You have the right to be believed . '' Faludi shames contrarians for cynically appending a `` believe all victims '' hashtag alongside a question mark , but it 's right there in Clinton 's initial tweet , between the words to and survivor . # MeToo advocates demanded a presumption of belief for every individual who claims to be a sexual misconduct victim : i.e. , believe all women .\nIt was equally clear when Biden stated the mantra during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings : `` For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus , nationally , you 've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she 's talking about is real\u2014whether or not she forgets facts , whether or not it 's been made worse or better over time .
