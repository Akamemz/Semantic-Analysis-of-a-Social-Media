John Cornyn ( R ) of Texas , a skeptic of the overall immigration package , at a hearing on the immigration reform bill last week .\nWhere will the millions of hours of English-language instruction that the undocumented will need , if they are to obtain green cards , come from ? ask advocates for immigrants . And with the prospect of perhaps 10 million illegal immigrants moving along the road to citizenship over the next decade , where will communities look for resources and best practices to begin to bring them out of the shadows and into community life ? they wonder .\nToday , America \u2019 s immigrant integration system is best known for letting local groups help new immigrants in ways unique to their communities .
