He signed it in the Oval Office just before leaving Washington for the holidays. Trump, who had been traveling the country for months calling on Congress to act on taxes, calls it \u201cthe largest tax cut in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nWHAT THE TAX OVERHAUL MEANS FOR YOU\n\nThe tax bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and reduces the rates for most of the seven individual tax brackets.\n\nWhile critics panned the law as a big tax break for the wealthy and corporations, the overhaul doubles the standard deduction, which the Trump administration argues is a boon for the middle class.\n\nTRUMP PREDICTS MANDATE REPEAL WILL KILL OBAMACARE\n\nThe legislation also allows Trump to say he\u2019s working to dismantle ObamaCare: the bill includes a repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance or face a penalty.\n\nREGULATORY ROLLBACK\n\nGridlock in Congress has not stopped the president from unraveling former President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action legacy, especially through regulatory rollbacks.\n\n\u201cYou've ended the overregulation of the American economy,\u201d McConnell told him during the White House celebration.\n\nTrump's EPA has moved to roll back the Clean Power Plan and he has used the Congressional Review Act, an obscure rule-killing law, to wipe out a wave of last-minute regulations pushed through before he took office.\n\nSTUDIES BEHIND OBAMA REGS UNDER FIRE\n\nAfter taking office, the president signed an executive order mandating that two regulations must be eliminated for every one created. The White House says the administration has surpassed that ratio, claiming to have eliminated 22 regulations for every new regulation.\n\nTrump has taken other actions to please conservatives, including moving to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, green-lighting the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nPACKING THE COURTS\n\nTrump often cites his successful nomination of Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch when discussing his accomplishments as president. Gorsuch had been on the list of potential nominees that Trump released during the campaign, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nTRUMP MAKES HISTORIC MARK ON FEDERAL BENCH\n\nBut Republicans are also thrilled about his nominations to lower courts. The Trump administration has been intentionally choosing young conservative judicial nominees who could stay on the bench for many years to come. As of mid-December, 19 of Trump's 66 total nominees this year have been confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe've cemented the Supreme Court right-of-center for a generation,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cMr. President, thanks to your nominees, we've put 12 circuit court judges in place -- the most since the circuit court system was established in 1891.\u201d\n\nDECIMATING ISIS\n\nAs the Islamic State orchestrated terror attacks and established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump famously promised during to \u201cbomb the sh-t\u201d out of ISIS.\n\nThe gains cannot be ignored.\n\nU.S. military officials said this week that ISIS has lost 98 percent of the territory it once held -- with half of the terror group's \"caliphate\" having been recaptured since Trump took office. The latest American intelligence assessment says fewer than 1,000 ISIS fighters now remain in Iraq and Syria, down from a peak of nearly 45,000 just two years ago.\n\nISIS HAS LOST 98 PERCENT OF ITS TERRITORY, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nIn October, after the liberation of Raqqa in Syria, the president boasted that \u201cmore progress\u201d had been made \u201cagainst these evil terrorists in the past several months than in the past several years.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Iraq\u2019s leaders declared victory over ISIS.\n\nThe White House recently credited Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d in noting that ISIS has \u201clost nearly all of its territory and its most important cities and towns in Iraq and Syria, including Mosul and ISIS\u2019s declared capital in Raqqa.\u201d\n\nECONOMY GROWING\n\nTrump is never shy about taking credit when the stock market is doing well, and closed the year by predicting the tax bill will spur another year of growth in 2018.\n\n\"Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!\" he tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration has indeed been good for Wall Street: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit record highs more than 60 times during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe White House cites statistics saying more than $5 trillion in wealth has been added to the U.S. economy since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nOther indicators show the economy has improved under Trump.\n\nThe country\u2019s 4.1 percent unemployment rate is the lowest since December 2000.\n\nAnd the economy grew 3.2 percent from July through September, the highest quarterly economic growth in three years.\n\nCONSERVATIVE-PLEASING MOVES\n\nTrump has pleased his base by appointing people like Attorney General Jeff Sessions, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Education Secretary Betsy Devos and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to high-profile government positions. In a less than a year, these officials have enacted conservative policy at departments and agencies after eight years of liberal governance under the Obama administration.\n\nThe president also officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital earlier this month, following through on a promise to put in place a plan to move the United States embassy to the holy city.\n\nHe pardoned ex-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in June, a move that was welcomed by supporters of a tough stance on illegal immigration.\n\nIn October, Trump decertified the 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- though did not kill it -- calling it \u201cone of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\u201d",
