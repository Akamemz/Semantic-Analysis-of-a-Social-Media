It \u2019 s an ordeal with increasingly international ramifications , as a growing number of pregnant women flee to countries like Colombia seeking care they can not get in Venezuela .\n\u201c Women are getting pregnant and don \u2019 t have options , \u201d said Luisa Kislinger , a women \u2019 s rights activist . \u201c They \u2019 re forced into motherhood . \u201d\nNicol Ram\u00edrez is 15 and already a mother .

Maternal death rates rose over 65 % between 2015 and 2016 .\nHealth professionals believe Venezuela could cut its high maternal mortality rate by a third doing one thing : Providing contraceptives .\nThe extent of Venezuela \u2019 s birth control shortage and the impact on women is difficult to quantify in part because the government has not released information on key indicators like teenage pregnancy since 2012 . According to those now dated figures , just over 23 % of all births in Venezuela were to women under the age of 20 .\nSome independent health organizations and women \u2019 s rights groups contend the rate could now be as high as 28 % . A study of four hospitals last year found that over a quarter of all births recorded were to teenage mothers .\nThe most recent U.N. world population report estimates Venezuela \u2019 s teen pregnancy rate is about 85.3 per 1,000 adolescents ages 15-19 . That figure would mark a slight decline , though is still over double the global rate . By comparison , Colombia \u2019 s rate is 66.7 per 1,000 teens ages 15-19 .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know what the reality is in 2019 , \u201d said Nelmary D\u00edaz , a program director the Civil Association for Family Planning , an organization that runs several clinics and has operated since 1986 . \u201c That worries us . \u201d\nAfter years of denying the existence of a humanitarian crisis , Maduro has recently begun allowing international aid . While a large part of the emergency assistance has gone toward food and medicine , a small portion is going toward reproductive health .\nThe U.N. Population Fund has imported 45,000 hormonal implants so far with the government \u2019 s authorization . An estimated 17,000 have been distributed thus far at hospitals and clinics like the one in Caucaguita where women line up before dawn .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to have more kids , \u201d said Yailyn Salas , 20 , the mother of a 9-month-old son in the line . \u201c I want to close the shop . \u201d\nAmong the millions of Venezuelans who have chosen to flee are thousands of pregnant women . In Colombia , over 26,000 Venezuelan women have given birth since August 2015 . That surge is straining Colombia \u2019 s already fragile health care system and testing the nation \u2019 s mostly welcoming approach toward Venezuelan migrants .\nIn recent months , the mayor of one large Colombian city likened Venezuelans to \u201c a poor baby factory \u201d while a popular newspaper columnist implored migrants to \u201c stop giving birth . \u201d\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t stop reproducing like you are , it \u2019 s going to be even harder to see you as an opportunity for growth instead of a problem , \u201d journalist Claudia Palacios wrote .\nRam\u00edrez found out she was pregnant at 14 with her boyfriend of one year . Condoms and birth control pills were either impossible to find or too expensive . When she told her boyfriend the news , Ram\u00edrez said he responded coldly . He was 23 and already a father . He told her that he couldn \u2019 t handle another responsibility .\nAdolescent moms under 15 are twice as likely to die during pregnancy . Though Ram\u00edrez had access to prenatal care , doctors nonetheless had to perform an emergency C-section after the baby \u2019 s heartbeat became irregular .\n\u201c She was born practically dead , \u201d Ram\u00edrez said , her soft voice turning somber .\nRam\u00edrez \u2019 s ordeal to find birth control isn \u2019 t unusual . An independent survey of 151 pharmacies consulted over a five-month period last year found some contraceptives like the patch could not be found at all in Venezuela , while others including birth control pills are experiencing near-total shortages .\nEven with this year \u2019 s increased access to aid , experts say Venezuela will need far more to address the needs of the estimated 9 million women in the country at risk of pregnancy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very small impact , \u201d said Jorge D\u00edaz Polanco , a sociologist with the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Health .\nClemente \u2019 s brigade was able to get ahold of a handful of the U.N.-provided implants that prevent ovulation and last four years .
