The resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement . And lawmakers in states including New York and Michigan , as well as a number of cities , have begun to scale back commitments to innovative charter ideas .\nMany in the public charter school movement were stunned last month to see the Trump administration \u2019 s most recent budget proposal , which eliminated the 26-year-old federal Charter Schools Program that helped jump-start such schools . While not opposing charters per se , the administration has outlined scaled-back block grants that allow states to use federal education dollars as they see fit . A portion of the block grants would go toward the proposed Education Freedom Scholarships program , designed to give families access to private and religious schools .\nWhile charter schools have been a centerpiece of education reform in the United States for nearly 30 years , their supporters have suddenly found themselves buffeted by forces from both the left and right .\nThroughout his career as an expert in education policy and public charter schools , Matthew Ladner has championed the core idea that families should have a wider range of choices as they seek to find the best schools for their children .\nBut the Arizona-based reformer admits he \u2019 s probably in the minority of charter school advocates who also champion another side of school choice policy , the effort to expand state-funded vouchers and tax credits for families who want to send their children to private and religious schools .\nMany of Mr. Ladner \u2019 s peers are wary of the politically charged voucher movement , long a priority of religious conservatives , and argue they should keep their distance , focusing more on expanding choice within public education . As he sees it , though , \u201c charters have 99 problems , but private choice is not one of them . \u201d\n\u201c The fact of the matter is that charter schools are under assault , \u201d says Mr. Ladner , director of the Arizona Center for Student Opportunity at the Arizona Charter Schools Association . \u201c We are starting to have too few friends , not too many . In a big-tent movement there \u2019 s always going to be tensions , and there \u2019 s going to be spats , but at the end of the day , the private-choice people are not an enemy at all . \u201d\nNot too long ago , policy experts often called charter schools the last remaining bipartisan issue , noting how Democrats and Republicans , including the administrations of Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and especially Barack Obama , made expanding charter schools a significant part of their education policies .\nYet while charter schools have been a centerpiece of education reform in the United States for nearly 30 years , their supporters have found themselves buffeted by forces from both the left and right , observers say .\nLast month , many in the public charter school movement were stunned to see the Trump administration \u2019 s most recent budget proposal , which eliminated the 26-year-old federal Charter Schools Program that helped jump-start such schools . While not opposing charters per se , the administration \u2013 including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , a longtime school choice advocate \u2013 has proposed scaled-back block grants that allow states to use their federal education dollars as they see fit .\n\u201c The Trump administration has consistently said that school choice is a priority , but this budget doesn \u2019 t demonstrate that , \u201d says Harry Lee , president of the New Jersey Charter Schools Association . \u201c Instead , there \u2019 s this move to these Education Freedom Scholarships , giving tax credits which would essentially help families access private and religious schools . \u201d\nFew expect Congress to pass this budget proposal , but it represents a dramatic shift in the administration \u2019 s priorities , observers say . Instead of charters , a portion of its proposed $ 19.4 billion in block grants is specifically allocated to this $ 5 billion scholarship program .\nRoss D. Franklin/AP U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos smiles as she is applauded by Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey during a roundtable discussion on school choice Dec. 5 , 2019 , in Scottsdale , Arizona . Ms. DeVos is a longtime school choice advocate .\nThe Trump administration says the elimination of the Charter Schools Program does not mean it opposes such schools , only that it prefers to let the states decide how they spend their federal funds .\n\u201c There is a mountain of evidence that charter schools help students succeed and very high parental demand for spots in charter schools , \u201d says Angela Morabito , press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education , in an email . \u201c We believe states know this , and we fully expect that innovative states would continue sending federal dollars to public charter schools . States may even choose to send more federal dollars to them . \u201d\nThe shift in Republican priorities comes at a time when charter schools have come under attack from liberal Democrats who have also sought to curtail , if not eliminate , the long-standing federal program supporting charter schools .\nThe resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement . Lawmakers in states such as California , New York , and Michigan , as well as a number of cities that have been leaders in crafting a range of innovative charter schools , have begun to scale back their commitments to such ideas .\n\u201c Charters have evolved from their original concept as small incubators of innovation , \u201d says Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda , president of the National Education Association , in an email . \u201c We now find that too frequently charters are operated expressly for profit , or are nominally non-profit but managed or operated by for-profit entities . \u201d\nIn many ways , charter schools have become ensnared in a growing clash of civic values , observers say , as many on the left start to emphasize egalitarian and secular ideals to combat the inequities in American education .

Montana Department of Revenue , could create a \u201c virtual earthquake \u201d in the nation \u2019 s public education landscape .\n\u201c What \u2019 s at stake in Espinoza is , if we win this case , tens of thousands of children , perhaps hundreds of thousands , will finally have access to educational choice programs , \u201d Ms. Smith says .\nThe debate over vouchers and tax credits has become an epic constitutional battle over the meaning of the First Amendment \u2019 s establishment clause and the separation of church and state , many experts say . But liberal educators also see the broader effects of the school choice movement as a threat to the ideals of equal opportunity and universal public education .\n\u201c Simply put , vouchers do not ensure that all of our students have access to the opportunities and resources they need and deserve , \u201d says Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda . \u201c These voucher [ and tax credit ] proposals divert already scarce funding away from neighborhood public schools \u2013 where 90 percent of children go \u2013 and give it away to private schools , which are not accountable to taxpayers . \u201d\nThere are some 7,000 charter schools across the 43 states with programs , as well as the District of Columbia , and they serve about 3.2 million students \u2013 about 6 % of K-12 public schools , researchers say .
