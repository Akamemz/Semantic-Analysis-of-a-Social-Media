    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c It is customary , when faced with the grotesque inequalities of the criminal-justice system , to decry the preferential treatment that people such as Jeffrey Epstein enjoy . Rather than complain that Epstein got too much justice , it would be far more productive to complain that most people get too little . Adequately funded criminal defense , bail reform , and other commonsense changes would do far more to improve the system than the prosecution of an occasional billionaire. \u201d Ken White , The Atlantic\n\u201c There \u2019 s no doubt that the judicial system must examine the accusations against Mr. Epstein , and that the Justice Department will have many questions about Mr. Acosta \u2019 s apparent leniency toward him . Congress digging into this case , however , is a poor use of lawmakers \u2019 limited time and resources . More dangerous , in the midst of the Trump administration \u2019 s war on congressional oversight in general , such hearings carry a high risk of turning the Epstein case into a partisan battle \u2014 and Mr. Acosta into a political martyr around whom the president and his followers feel moved to rally\u2026 better to let the legal system and the court of public opinion carry this particular burden. \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\nRegarding Acosta , \u201c perhaps there was nothing [ he ] , amid mounting criticism , could have said at Wednesday \u2019 s press conference to make things right . But the proper approach , obvious to many , was to show some contrition . He could have acknowledged his mistakes and apologized for them . He could have highlighted why others shouldn \u2019 t discount victims of sexual abuse in the future as he once did . He could have even resigned . Acosta chose another path . He gave an astonishingly Trumpian performance : admit no error , shift responsibility , and blame the media . \u201d Matt Ford , New Republic\n\u201c It took a network of people putting their own personal , financial , and sexual interests over the safety and dignity of girls to keep Epstein \u2019 s alleged child-abuse operation running . It will take a network that \u2019 s just as substantial to uncover the extent of Epstein \u2019 s possible crimes . It \u2019 s perverse , but there \u2019 s a direct relationship between the magnitude of a system of abuse and the magnitude of the effort required to end it . The fact that so many people appear to have known about and participated in Epstein \u2019 s alleged child-trafficking enterprise has not been a liability for him ; indeed , it has been his foremost strength. \u201d Christina Cauterucci , Slate\n\u201c When most people get out of jail , they can barely get a job at a fast food joint . Not our man Epstein\u2026 Celebrities were still turning up at Epstein-hosted parties even after he was released from jail . The NYPD seemingly waived requirements that Epstein , a convicted sex offender , report in on a regular basis \u2014 [ a ] kindness the department doesn \u2019 t extend to the nonwhite or non-wealthy . More than a few charities and nonprofits continued to line up at the trough for a chance at his money\u2026 the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is something , I predict , that will come to be viewed in future years as one of the defining events that brings our age of excess to a close . \u201d Helaine Olen , Washington Post\n\u201c The Epstein case is first and foremost about the casual victimization of vulnerable girls . But it is also a political scandal , if not a partisan one . It reveals a deep corruption among mostly male elites across parties , and the way the very rich can often purchase impunity for even the most loathsome of crimes. \u201d Michelle Goldberg , New York Times\nThe right argues that Bevin \u2019 s loss was an outlier , but nevertheless is concerned about what the overall results say about GOP prospects .\n\u201c Perhaps the most historic , in the sense of era-defining , moment in the history of the Academy Awards was that standing ovation Roman Polanski got when he was given Best Director honors in 2003 . There they are , leading Hollywood liberals , leaping to their feet to cheer for a man who , at age 43 , gave a 13-year-old girl Quaaludes for the purpose of having sex with her and sodomizing her . Polanski suffered in no significant way for his crime\u2026\n\u201c The Jeffrey Epstein case should end a nearly 50-year era in which the mandarins of our cultures \u2014 the intellectuals , writers , and artists \u2014 almost unanimously ignored , laughed off , or even outright celebrated sexual exploitation of girls and very young women , even in many cases prepubescent ones\u2026 Epstein \u2019 s habits were so unremarkable that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were happy to be associated with him . Clinton and Trump were not outliers . They were simply symptoms of a disease . \u201d\nRegarding Acosta , some note that in 2005 \u201c police brought the case to the local prosecutor , Barry Krischer , an elected Democratic official . But Krischer wasn \u2019 t interested in pursuing felony charges against Epstein , a well-known donor to political candidates ( mostly Democrats ) ... When Krischer refused , [ local police ] took the case to federal law enforcement . Federal prosecutors , it is important to note , generally have no jurisdiction over sex crimes . But they agreed to investigate whether Epstein violated federal law by , among other things , using the facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls into prostitution\u2026\n\u201c The U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office determined that federal charges against Epstein might not stick . But they were able to leverage their investigation to extract a plea\u2026 While the punishment was inadequate to the crime , from all reports , the experienced , career prosecutors reporting to Acosta felt it was better than any alternative . The deal put Epstein behind bars , allowed his victims to seek restitution , and put the public on notice that Epstein is a sexual predator . \u201d\n\u201c The vast majority of criminal cases end with plea bargains \u2014 about 94 % at the state level and 97 % at the federal level\u2026 Perhaps one of the only good things to come from Epstein \u2019 s case is the exposure of inappropriate or fraudulent plea deals in the justice system that let accused criminals walk away from a trial , and force others to plead guilty without a chance to claim innocence . Plea bargains guarantee efficiency : costly , time-consuming trials are avoided more often than not . But at what cost ? \u2026\n\u201c If anything , Acosta is a symptom of a justice system that is broken and rotting from within . He is not responsible for Epstein \u2019 s crimes , but he did facilitate a deal that resulted in a total lapse of accountability . President Trump must decide if this past failure requires Acosta \u2019 s resignation . And we must decide what to do about a criminal justice system that let a monster walk free . \u201d\n\u201c On social media , lots of people seem to think that any revelations from this prosecution will be devastating to the party they oppose and avert their eyes from the possibility that Epstein could start talking about sordid and criminal behavior by prominent figures in their preferred party . Investigate them all , name them all , indict them all , prosecute them all . No figure is so important to a political party or the country that we need to avert our eyes from underage sex trafficking . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party .

In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
