Marco Rubio \u2019 s presidential campaign . \u201c Conceivable he might put some overwhelmingly white states of the Great Lakes region into play for Republicans with a large blue-collar white [ voter ] turnout .\n\u201c But both sides get to play this game , \u201d Mr. Ayres said . \u201c He would also put Republican-leaning states with large nonwhite populations into play given his toxic numbers among Hispanics and African-Americans . \u201d\nMr. Trump solidified himself as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee this week after he chased from the race his last remaining opponents , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov . John Kasich .\nHe now begins to prepare for a November showdown \u2014 most likely with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who while facing a nagging challenge from Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont is expected to emerge as the Democratic nominee .\nA CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday shows the challenge for Mr. Trump , putting him 13 points behind Mrs. Clinton , at 54 percent to 41 percent .\nThe survey showed Mrs. Clinton claiming 94 percent of self-identified Democrats , while Mr. Trump gets 84 percent of Republicans . Mrs. Clinton also leads 51 percent to 40 percent among independents .\nThe candidates poll evenly among men , at 47 percent apiece , but women break overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton , 61 percent to 35 percent .\nMr. Trump did lead among white voters , 52 percent to 43 percent , but Mrs. Clinton had an overwhelming advantage among racial and ethnic minorities , 81 percent to 14 percent , signaling the importance for her campaign to maximize turnout from those communities .\nWith the Electoral College controlling the presidential election , the key battles will be state by state . Analysts said Mr. Trump could end up losing traditionally Republican Sun Belt states such as Arizona and Georgia , even as he tries to put Rust Belt states into play .\nDemocrats in the past four presidential elections have consistently won states that account for 246 electoral votes , close to the 270 needed to win the White House . Republicans won just 179 Electoral College votes from states that supported them in each of the past four elections .\nIn other words , Mrs. Clinton could win the November election by defending the Democratic strongholds and winning Florida with the help of the state \u2019 s Hispanic population , which has been turned off by Mr. Trump \u2019 s hard-line stance on immigration .\n\u201c The easiest job in American politics in 2016 goes to the Democratic operative tasked to dramatically increase Hispanic participation to stop Donald Trump , \u201d Mr. Ayres said .\nMr. Trump plans to counter by striking out into territory that has voted Democratic in recent elections .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure I \u2019 ll win Pennsylvania . I \u2019 ll win Florida , \u201d he told CNN on Wednesday . \u201c I will put states in play that no other Republican will even talk about or go to . \u201d\nHe also predicted victory in Michigan and said he will make New York competitive by running up huge margins in the state \u2019 s economically challenged areas , such as Buffalo .\nBut Mr. Trump \u2019 s best chance is to try to poison voters against Mrs. Clinton .\n\u201c If the election is a referendum on him , you \u2019 d have to think he is going to be in a little trouble , but if he successfully makes it a referendum about her , she is toast , \u201d said Michael McKenna , a Republican Party strategist . \u201c She personally can \u2019 t stand scrutiny . She is not a very likable person . She is not a very friendly person , and her record is shaky at best . \u201d\nMr. McKenna said working-class voters who have been in the Democratic camp in recent elections could flee to Mr. Trump , and Mrs. Clinton will likely have a smaller share of the black vote than Mr. Obama did in states such as Ohio and Virginia .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s path to the nomination also could expand if the fundamentals of the race change through a world event or economic downturn , Mr. McKenna said .\nFrank Cannon , president of the American Principles Project , said Mr. Trump has masterfully branded his opponents and will need to do the same to take down Mrs. Clinton .\n\u201c He will go right for the jugular , \u201d he said . \u201c He will say , \u2018 How did you defend the women that your husband brutalized and attacked ? You were part of the effort to discredit and hurt those women . How are you the defender of the women ? \u2019 So everything will be in bounds , and he will not allow things to be said that are naked strengths of Hillary \u2019 s without there being a counterattack .\n\u201c The question is : Are his branding skills good enough to work with non-Republicans ? \u201d Mr. Cannon said .\nMr. Trump has accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the \u201c women \u2019 s card \u201d \u2014 suggesting that her eight years as first lady , eight years as a senator from New York and four years as secretary of state have not prepared her for the presidency .\nHe has already nicknamed her \u201c Crooked Hillary , \u201d a reference to the ongoing investigations into Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s violation of State Department policy by keeping a secret email account .\n\u201c She should not be allowed to run in the election , \u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday on MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Morning Joe. \u201d \u201c She should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has . \u201d\nMr. Trump also has touted polls showing him running strong against Mrs. Clinton , including a recent George Washington University Battleground poll that showed the former first lady with a 46 percent to 43 percent lead over Mr. Trump .\nEd Goeas , a Republican Party pollster who helped conduct the battleground survey , said the poll included stark warning signs for Mr. Trump \u2014 showing Mrs. Clinton up 12 points in the tossup states , with a higher net favorable rating and with more room to grow among undecided voters .\n\u201c So , he really has two plays here , \u201d he said . \u201c One is he has to drive her unfavorables up , specifically with conservative Democrats , because quite frankly independents don \u2019 t like either one of them . And the other hope has to be that you take that race with independents not liking either one and undecideds not liking either one , maybe they all stay home and that at least makes it a closer race . \u201d",
