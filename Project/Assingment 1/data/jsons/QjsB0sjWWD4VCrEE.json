Even on a recent New York Times editorial page , Rep. Steve Israel ( D-NY ) bemoaned the constant necessity of raising money \u2014 so much so that 's he 's leaving Congress .\nA recently published book by political scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst posits that these vexing phenomena are not unrelated . Authors Raymond La Raja and Brian Schaffner cleverly leverage the widely differing set of campaign finance laws in the 50 American states to show that our current set of restrictive campaign finance laws exacerbates political polarization .\nThey think of the campaign finance world as being divided into two groups : `` pragmatists '' and `` purists .

They seek to make an impact on policy , sometimes with respect to specific issues .\nBoth the modern parties are made up these two types , especially when we think of parties as `` extended networks '' that include activists and issue-oriented groups . The Democratic Party , for example , has pragmatists like DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz , whose chief job is to help get Democrats elected .\nBut the party also includes purists , like NARAL Pro-Choice America , which would like to see Democrats elected but only because Democrats are likely to advance their abortion rights policy agenda . Ultimately , the purists care more about their policy than about winning elections . The Republicans have the same setup \u2014 think Reince Priebus and the National Rifle Association .\nSince the pragmatists care more about winning elections than about enacting policy they have a moderating effect on politics . A pragmatist is more likely to enter coalitions , make compromises , and negotiate to settlements . Purists , on the other hand , are willing to lose elections in the name of their causes . They 're less likely to engage in cooperative behavior and to seek to negotiate with the other side to resolve conflicts . In other words , the purists polarize .\nCampaign finance laws directly affect the relative balance between pragmatists and purists in the parties . While there is considerable variance across the states , most campaign finance laws restrict the behavior of , and contributions to , the formal party organizations .\nUltimately , then , we 've created systems of campaign finance that constrain the moderates \u2014 those who have incentives to compromise \u2014 while we 've left the purists completely unregulated . Candidates , then , have incentives to court these purists because that 's where the money is . This creates incentives for increasingly ideologically extreme candidates to pursue , and win , office .\nIt might be difficult to convince America that parties are good , but that 's exactly the case .
