    "content": "It 's always been true , as gun restrictionists have repeatedly promised , that `` nobody 's going to take your guns away . '' But few gun owners have ever believed that was from lack of intent ; it was always from the absence of any practical way of implementing such a taking . That 's become increasingly clear in the wake of the truly horrific Mandalay Bay massacre as open calls for repealing the Second Amendment 's protection for self-defense , and even for banning privately owned guns , get louder .\nAnd still , the increasingly open prohibitionists have n't come up with a proposal to make their plans stick .\nPerhaps most prominent is Bret Stephens , a conservative columnist at the New York Times . He pointed to Stephen Paddock 's rampage in Las Vegas , as well as some alleged correlations between firearms ownership and homicide ( contradicted by other research ) , dismissed most gun control efforts as `` feckless , '' and called on America to `` Repeal the Second Amendment '' or else `` Expansive interpretations of the right to bear arms will be the law of the land\u2014until the 'right ' itself ceases to be . ''\nAnd what 's the point of stripping way part of the Bill of Rights if you 're not going to then pass restrictive laws previously barred by the deleted provision ? Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) makes no secret of her long-time desire to outlaw anything made of metal with a hole in it . Senator Chris Murphy ( D-CT ) sees every intrusive law as only `` a first step on gun control . '' Progressive documentary filmmaker Michael Moore wants to repeal the Second Amendment , and wo n't rest until `` All automatic and semi-automatic guns are banned '' and `` guns must be stored at a licensed gun club or government-regulated gun storage facility . '' The New Yorker 's Adam Gopnik wants `` no truce with the Second Amendment . '' And the New Republic 's Phoebe Maltz Bovy says `` It 's Time to Ban Guns . Yes , All of Them . `` \u2014in a demand originally published in 2015 , but reissued by her publication last week . Taking the anti-gun crusade right up to 11 , hereditary celebrity Nancy Sinatra thinks `` the murderous members of the NRA should face a firing squad . ''\nWell , that should certainly convince gun owners of the desirability of compromise and of surrendering their property .\nBut , contrary to Stephens ' assertions , expansive interpretations of rights do n't depend on black-letter protections under the law . People around the world assert a right to free speech even in places where the exercise of the same is harshly punished . The same-sex marriage that the Times columnist rightly cites as a major political accomplishment was fought for by people who considered it their right long before the law recognized it in any way . The idea that rights exist naturally and independently of political protections is a long American tradition , extending well before Thomas Jefferson wrote `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness '' and through Joe Biden 's 2008 assertion that `` I believe my rights are not derived from the Constitution . My rights are not derived from any government . My rights are not denied by any majority . My rights are because I exist . '' Repeal the Second Amendment , and you 're not telling gun owners that their right has been eliminated ; you 're telling them that the legal and political system under which they live is hostile to rights they take as inherent , and that they 'll now have to be more vigilant than ever .\nThat 's assuming that a philosophical basis is required to inspire people to acquire and keep weapons . That 's not necessarily so .\nWe do n't know whether many Germans , for instance , believe in a natural right to bear arms , but we do know that Germany offers no legal guarantees for such a right . The country 's laws are rather restrictive , too . Yet the country 's roughly 82 million people own about 5.8 million legal firearms and 20 million illegal ones as of 2016 , according to the Sydney School of Public Health 's GunPolicy.org . The Geneva-based Small Arms Survey has similar numbers , putting the 2003 figures at 7.2 million legal weapons and 17-20 million illegal ones . For France 's 67 million people , GunPolicy.org puts legal firearms at 2.8 million for 2016 , and guesstimates 7.2 million illegal ones . Small Arms Survey agrees on the legal figure , but puts illegal firearms in France at 15 to 17 million .\nNeither France nor Germany has anything like a Second Amendment , but millions of inhabitants of both countries arm themselves with firearms nevertheless , either because they remain committed to a philosophical right to do so , or because they just think it 's a good idea . And they acquire and keep those guns largely in defiance of laws intended to disarm them .\nDoes anybody really believe that Americans steeped in a culture of natural rights and a history of personal armament will be more compliant than Europeans with no such heritage ?\nIllegally armed though many Germans may be , they remain remarkably peaceful , with a homicide rate of 0.8 per 100,000 people and a gun homicide rate of 0.05 per 100,000 people , according to GunPolicy.org 's latest figures . France has a homicide rate of 0.6 per 100,000 and a gun homicide rate of 0.22 per 100,000 . Remember , this is in countries containing millions of guns , most owned illegally . By contrast , the rate of total homicide in the U.S. is 4.96 per 100,000 and gun homicides are 3.43 per 100,000 , by GunPolicy.org 's numbers .\nSo , French and Germans are less murderous overall than Americans ( even after several decades of general declining violent crime in the U.S. ) , and remain less murderous despite possessing impressive illegal armories . And those armories are of a size to make the difference in violent crime rates even more stark . Could something else\u2013say cultural factors\u2013be at work here ?\nThe social psychologist Steven Pinker , author of The Better Angels of Our Nature , thinks so . He believes that America 's frontier experience , with people settling well ahead of a government presence , makes a big difference . `` The United States has a higher rate of violence , partly because large parts of the country were in a state of anarchy until the 20th century . People could not count on the government to protect them , '' he told an interviewer in 2011 . `` When governments did arrive , people were reluctant to hand over their self-protection . And because the first government in America was a democracy , people were able to impose their wishes . In European countries , first the government disarmed the people and exerted its control many hundred years ago . Then the people democratized the government , but by then the government had already established control . ''\nWhich is to say that , relative to our European friends , Americans are a bit feral , violent , and resistant to control . Are we more resistant to control than the French and Germans who peacefully flout their countries ' laws ? Could be . History does n't suggest that repealing the Second Amendment and saying `` bring 'em in '' has much of a path to success .\nWhen in 1990 New Jersey imposed an `` assault weapons '' ban on the possession of semiautomatic rifles with certain cosmetic features that give them a military look , the response was underwhelming . One year later , the New York Times reported that of the estimated 100,000 to 300,000 affected weapons in the state , `` Only four military-style weapons have been turned in to the State Police and another 14 were confiscated . The state knows the whereabouts of fewer than 2,000 other guns . ''\nMore recently , after 2008 's Heller decision supposedly took the most draconian gun restrictions off the table by reaffirming the Second Amendment 's protection of individual right to own weapons , Connecticut passed a comparatively less restrictive registration requirement . Owners responded by telling the state about their possession of `` as little as 15 percent of the rifles classified as assault weapons owned by Connecticut residents , '' according to the Hartford Courant .\n`` If you pass laws that people have no respect for and they do n't follow them , then you have a real problem , '' commented Sen. Tony Guglielmo ( R-Stafford ) .\nNew York followed up with a similar law of its own that achieved perhaps 5 percent compliance .\n`` What these numbers expose is that , if there are people who are wilfully ignoring the law , that means tens of thousands of gun owners are not complying with a law that is supported by New Yorkers , '' huffed Leah Gunn Barrett of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence .\nThose overwhelming failures of restrictive gun laws came in three of the most gun-unfriendly states in the country . Two of them came after the Supreme Court issued assurances that total bans were off the table . What do Bret Stephens , Feinstein , Maltz Bovy , Moore , and company ( the less said of Sinatra , the better ) think is going to happen in the unlikely event that they successfully navigate the constitutional requirements to repeal part of the Bill of Rights and its legal protections ? Do they expect people in Arizona , Texas , Vermont and other more gun-friendly regions to meekly respond to the removal of the Second Amendment 's protections ? Or are they likely to dig in their heels ?\nIf it 's true that Americans are culturally more violent and less submissive to state power than some overseas cousins , their violent inclination are unlikely to respond easily to legal revisions .
