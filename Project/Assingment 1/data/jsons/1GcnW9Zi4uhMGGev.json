We can argue and disagree and then move on . After two hours of talking , we go home . \u201d\nThe Utica Coffee Club is at once a Norman Rockwell portrait of small-town America and a picture of how politics-as-it-once-was is disappearing . As Ohio voters go to the polls to vote in the state \u2019 s primary Tuesday , it is a poignant reminder that the polarization that currently seems to divide America can sometimes be defused by a plate of eggs and bacon and an affection for the person sitting on the other side of the table , no matter what his politics .\nIn the past , these connections were often made in diners , Elks Clubs , or even within more ideologically diverse political parties themselves . But today , voters are withdrawing into partisan bubbles , \u201c to the point of actively avoiding those who disagree , \u201d according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study .\nProbably the last people to think of the Utica Coffee Club as revolutionary are the members themselves . But in the simplicity of their fellowship is a political truth , says Kathy Cramer , a political scientist and director of the Morgridge Center for Public Service at the University of Wisconsin in Madison .\n\u201c The people in this coffee club have not only figured out how to get along , but they enjoy being with people of diverse opinions , \u201d she says . \u201c We don \u2019 t get great guidance from leadership on how to do that . We \u2019 re taught that people who think differently than us are morally wrong . \u201d\n\u201c Face to face conversation is delightful , \u201d she adds . \u201c You can read about something in a blog post and learn a lot , but there \u2019 s something about looking a human in the eye that makes that experience more real \u201d \u2013 and others \u2019 viewpoints harder to dismiss .\nThe men of the club look each other in the eye across the sycamore-wood table that they paid a local Amish carpenter to build for them . A Tiffany-style lamp hangs overhead . A photo of Otto Teele , one of the original members , hangs on one wall , his baseball cap and gray cardigan meticulously clean , a perpetual grin on his face as though still listening in on the conversation .\nPhil Shipley , the farmer with all the cows , likes her .\n\u201c She \u2019 s the most stable and experienced . I like Bernie [ Sanders ] , but his rhetoric and age might work against him . It might be hard for him work with Congress , \u201d he says .\nMr. Shipley served as county commissioner for 16 years . His mother was a Republican , his father a Democrat . The first time he ran for office , he faced his uncle , a Republican .\nAround the table , some claim to be Democrats , others Republicans . Others , like Terry Martin , say they \u2019 re swing voters . \u201c I vote for the candidate , \u201d Mr. Martin says .\nIn some ways , it \u2019 s a classic Midwestern scene , Professor Cramer says . She researches the role informal discussion groups play in a vibrant democracy , and while she says groups like this are on the decline , the Midwestern versions are remarkably free from strident party ideology .\n\u201c Of the groups I \u2019 ve researched in the Midwest , in general , they \u2019 re not partisan . I haven \u2019 t come across people who are devout partisans . Who live and die for their party . They pride themselves on voting for the person and not the party , \u201d she says . \u201c People expect their office holders to be serious about their jobs , to have integrity , and to be honest . There \u2019 s a lot of interest in people who are real . \u201d\nWhich is why Martin likes a lot of what Donald Trump is saying , though he \u2019 s not sure Mr. Trump would make good decisions on foreign affairs . Ohio Gov . John Kasich might be the best qualified , he says , but he hasn \u2019 t been good for Ohio schools .\nTellingly , the election is not the most important discussion at the table . There are more pressing things , like the club rules . If it \u2019 s your birthday , you buy breakfast for everyone . If you have a financial windfall , you buy a round of coffee . You must support one another \u2019 s causes by purchasing raffle tickets and attending events . And you better enjoy conversation and debate , but not take yourself , or the debate , too seriously .\nMr. Raines , the Vietnam veteran is worried about the economy and about what his grandchildren will face . \u201c In my dad \u2019 s day , if you had a job , you had it for life . We \u2019 ve lost a lot of jobs for our own citizens . At one time we had five gas stations and a barbershop . Now we have two gas stations and no barbershops . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m concerned about drugs , \u201d adds Jim Belt , who worked in an Owens Corning factory . \u201c That affects everyone . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s lots of nodding in agreement .
