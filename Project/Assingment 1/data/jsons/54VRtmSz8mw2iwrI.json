    "content": "Andrew Breitbart would have been proud : on Thursday , his website became Hillary Clinton \u2019 s number one target .\nIn his book , Righteous Indignation : Excuse Me While I Save the World ! , Andrew recalled how he warned the Tea Party what lay ahead for them : \u201c I said that they \u2019 d be labeled racists and hate mongers and violent criminals , that they \u2019 d be depicted as the dregs of society , people to be excluded from dinner parties because of their made-up closet KKK status . They were about to be targeted . \u201d\nAndrew added : \u201c They need to marginalize and demonize those that would stand up to their hardball , toxic , and antidemocratic tactics \u2026 But it won \u2019 t work . Given a fair hearing , given just the slightest exposure \u2014 and the American people will rise to the occasion . They see these tactics for what they are . \u201d\nConservatives will never be \u201c given \u201d a fair hearing . But I made sure I was personally on hand in Reno to hear Hillary Clinton \u2019 s lies , wearing my Breitbart shirt .\nHere are the 20 worst lies in her speech , in chronological order .\n1 . [ Trump \u2019 s rhetoric ] is like nothing we \u2019 ve heard before from a nominee for President of the United States . On the contrary , Barack Obama has specialized in divisive rhetoric , both as a candidate ( \u201c bitter clingers , \u201d \u201c typical white person \u201c ) and as president . And , of course , Hillary Clinton often uses racist language . In 2008 , she pandered to \u201c hard-working \u2026 white Americans \u201d ; in 2016 , she borrows from Black Lives Matter , talking about \u201c white privilege \u201d and \u201c systemic racism . \u201d\n2 . He \u2019 s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America \u2019 s two major political parties . Donald Trump has nothing to do with hate groups , but a \u201c radical fringe \u201d has been in charge of the Democratic Party for a decade \u2014 and she was its first victim , in the 2008 primaries . Since then , the party \u2019 s leaders have embraced the Occupy Wall Street protests and the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 which she still supports despite its incitement against police .\n3 . In just the past week , under the guise of \u201c outreach \u201d to African Americans , Trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in insulting and ignorant terms : \u201c Poverty . Rejection . Horrible education . No housing . No homes . No ownership . Crime at levels nobody has seen\u2026 Right now , you walk down the street , you get shot. \u201d Ironically , Clinton said that in front of a \u201c largely white \u201d audience in Reno . But consider what she is saying : if you speak honestly about problems in the black community , you are racist . That is how political correctness has imprisoned blacks for 50 years , ever since ( Democrat ) Pat Moynihan tried to talk about the crisis in the black family .\n4 . A man with a long history of racial discrimination . Trump has no history whatsoever of racial discrimination . At the Democratic National Convention last month , former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley fled from the camera rather than cite one single example of anything Trump had said about black people , much less done . Clinton cited a handful of lawsuits by the Department of Justice \u2014 a department which recently tried suing Louisiana school districts for helping black students .\n5 . And let \u2019 s not forget Trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so-called \u201c Birthers. \u201d The \u201c Birther \u201d movement started among Hillary Clinton \u2019 s own supporters in 2008 , encouraged by a candidate with a deliberate strategy of painting her opponent as not fully American . Her campaign also encouraged suspicions that Obama is a secret Muslim . If Trump is a racist for asking for Obama \u2019 s birth certificate , then Hillary Clinton is an even bigger racist than he .\n6 . In 2015 , Trump launched his own campaign for President with another racist lie . He described Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals . Trump \u2019 s statement was over-broad , but he was not describing \u201c immigrants. \u201d He was describing illegal aliens . He did specifically add : \u201c And some , I assume , are good people. \u201d What the Clinton campaign does not want to acknowledge , in its push for open borders and total amnesty , is that some illegal aliens from Mexico do rape and murder .\n7 . This is someone who retweets white supremacists online . Trump is constantly on Twitter , and retweets many people . If he were interested in retweeting white supremacists , we would see many examples \u2014 not one or two inadvertent retweets among thousands . If you want to find extremism on Twitter , visit Hillary Clinton \u2019 s own Twitter feed , tweeting and retweeting Black Lives Matter . The day after police officers were murdered in Dallas , she was tweeting about white racism . Appalling .\n8 . His campaign famously posted an anti-Semitic image \u2013 a Star of David imposed over a sea of dollar bills \u2013 that first appeared on a white supremacist website . The Trump campaign didn \u2019 t realize the image was antisemitic , and did not know its origins . It changed the image after complaints . But look at the overt antisemitism in the Clinton campaign : a plan discussed by party officials to use Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 religion against him , for example , which Clinton never condemned .\n9 . When asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of David Duke , a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan , Trump wouldn \u2019 t do it . Only later , again under mounting pressure , did he backtrack . What Clinton leaves out , of course , is that Trump had already denounced Duke and the KKK several times \u2014 including the day before that CNN interview . She falsely paints his repeated denunciation , in the days after the interview , as backtracking .\n10 . Trump said thousands of American Muslims in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks . They didn \u2019 t . \u201c Thousands \u201d did not , but a handful did . \u2588\u2588\u2588 did much of the legwork uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in New Jersey , and it was clear that a minority of American Muslims celebrated the attack . Clinton can barely bring herself even to acknowledge radical Islamic terror , so it is no surprise she would persist in her denial . But she has to lie in order to do so .\n11 . Just recently , Trump claimed President Obama founded ISIS . And then he repeated that nonsense over and over . This complaint might be taken seriously were it not a response to Clinton \u2019 s lie that Trump is the \u201c recruiting sergeant \u201d for ISIS . Trump \u2019 s claim that Obama ( and Clinton ) \u201c founded \u201d ISIS , by allowing a vacuum in Iraq , is an exaggeration of what happened , but Clinton \u2019 s claim that Americans are to blame for terror by criticizing Islam actually does the terrorists \u2019 work for them .\n12 . It \u2019 s another reason why Donald Trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States . This is a lie for the simple reason that it is what Democrats say about nearly every Republican presidential nominee , regardless . In 2008 , Obama constantly claimed that Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) lacked the temperament to be President of the United States .\n13 . And he \u2019 d ban Muslims around the world \u2013 1.5 billion men , women , and children -from entering our country just because of their religion . Trump has since refined his policy to target immigrants and visitors from regions of the world ( predominantly Musilm ) where terrorism is a problem . But note that the reason for his policy is not because of religion itself , but rather because extremist members of that religion have a horrifyingly frequent habit of terrorism against innocent people .\n14 . \u201c Hoist It High And Proud : The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage. \u201d Clinton singled out several \u2588\u2588\u2588 headlines ( among thousands ) to claim that the site is racist . The irony of this particular headline , which comes from a guest op-ed , is that Clinton embraced the Confederate flag for decades \u2014 not just as First Lady of Arkansas , whose own state flag commemorates the Confederate flag ( by her husband \u2019 s decree ) , but later on the campaign trail in 2008 .\n15 . Trump \u2013 the only Presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the Pope . Every Catholic Democratic presidential candidate who supports abortion is opposed to the Pope . In 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI reiterated that politicians who support abortion should be denied communion . Pope Francis has softened that rhetoric but the conflict remains .\n16 . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks hate groups , Breitbart embraces \u201c ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right. \u201d That is simply a lie , as anyone who reads Breitbart even occasionally would know . And the Southern Poverty Law Center has no credibility left \u2014 certainly since a would-be mass shooter used the center \u2019 s guide to \u201c hate \u201d groups to target the Family Research Council merely for supporting traditional marriage .\n17 . That one came shortly after the Charleston massacre , when Democrats and Republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides . Breitbart tried to enflame them further . On the contrary : as Democrats like Clinton were exploiting the Charleston attack to inflame racial division and push gun control , \u2588\u2588\u2588 focused on healing . There are several examples , including Lee Stranahan \u2019 s moving account of the makeshift memorial in Charleston .\n18 . Just yesterday , one of Britain \u2019 s most prominent right-wing leaders , Nigel Farage , who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum on leaving the European Union , campaigned with Donald Trump in Mississippi . Here Clinton repeats one of the most frequent \u2014 and self-defeating \u2014 delusions of the anti-Brexit campaign . ( Farage has already responded . ) The majority of British voters are not bigots ; they simply chose sovereignty over foreign bureaucracy .\n19 . Trump himself heaps praise on Putin and embrace pro-Russian policies . He talks casually of abandoning our NATO allies , recognizing Russia \u2019 s annexation of Crimea , and of giving the Kremlin a free hand in Eastern Europe more generally . How rich this is , coming from a former Secretary of State who championed the Russian \u201c reset \u201d and ensured , after a hefty donation to the Clinton Foundation , that a Russian firm controlled by Putin owned 20 % of American uranium .\n20 . Parents and teachers are already worried about what they \u2019 re calling the \u201c Trump Effect. \u201d Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools , especially targeting students of color , Muslims , and immigrants . There is little evidence to support this claim . But Americans have been bullied \u2014 by the Obama administration , which unleashed the IRS on its political enemies , and accused opponents of the Iran deal of making \u201c common cause \u201d with the regime \u2014 attacks that Clinton supports .\nJoel B.
