    "content": "Andy Ngo , a photojournalist and editor at Quillette , landed in the emergency room after a mob of antifa activists attacked him on the streets of Portland during a Saturday afternoon demonstration .\nThe assailants wore black clothing and masks , and were engaged in a counter-protest against several right-wing groups , including the Proud Boys . Ngo is a well-known chronicler of antifa activity , and has criticized their illiberal tactics on Fox News . He attended the protest in this capacity\u2014as a journalist , covering a notable public event .\nAccording to Ngo , his attacker stole his camera equipment . But video footage recorded by another journalist , The Oregonian 's Jim Ryan , clearly shows an antifa activist punching Ngo in the face . Others throw milkshakes at him :\nFirst skirmish I 've seen . Did n't see how this started , but @ MrAndyNgo got roughed up . pic.twitter.com/hDkfQchRhG \u2014 Jim Ryan ( @ Jimryan015 ) June 29 , 2019\nThrowing milkshakes at right-wing politicians is a tactic of British progressive activists that recently traveled to this side of the Atlantic . Rep. Matt Gaetz ( R\u2013Fla . ) was hit with one earlier in June . The tactic has its defenders in mainstream left-of-center media as well : Vox 's Carlos Maza tweeted `` milkshake them all '' after a British activist hurled a milkshake at Nigel Farage .\nPortland police have claimed that some of the milkshakes thrown by the antifa activists on Saturday contained quick-dry cement . That may or may not be true . What is true is that an antifa mob beat up a journalist\u2014one who is harshly critical of them , to be sure , but who posed no physical threat to them and was only there to document their activities\u2014on a public street . This is indefensible , and yet there are tons of progressive-leaning people currently defending it , or at the very least rationalizing and making light of it .\nAntifa , of course , rejects the notion that violence should only be used in response to a physical threat . The group believes that the very existence of far-right people , groups , and ideas is a kind of provocation that justifies violence\u2014against the far-right , and against their enablers . ( For more about the ideology , tactics , and goals of the movement , order my new book , Panic Attack ; Young Radicals in the Age of Trump , which includes an entire chapter on antifa . )\nI have reached out to Ngo for comment and will update this post if I hear back .
