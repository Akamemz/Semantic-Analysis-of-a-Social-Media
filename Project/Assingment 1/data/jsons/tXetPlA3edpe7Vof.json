That \u2019 s not to say certain tropes aren \u2019 t repeated ad nauseam . But it is to say that that the press corps \u2019 desire to mitigate the unavoidable , soul-crushing monotony of a campaign often causes it to flip the script from one election to the next , despite politics in the real world changing much more slowly . If you look at the way the media \u2019 s covered the ongoing \u201c invisible primary \u201d to be the GOP \u2019 s next presidential nominee , you \u2019 ll see the narrative for 2016 is being pre-written already .\nSo , because the most important story of the 2012 cycle was the surprising potency of President Obama \u2019 s so-called Rising American Electorate , the story in 2014 concerned the Republicans \u2019 electorate , which also proved itself to be alive and kicking . And because the story after 2012 focused on the Tea Party pulling Mitt Romney too far to the right , the narrative for 2016 will be about the Republican \u201c establishment \u201d throwing its weight around to nominate an ostensibly more moderate , electable candidate . The bland , cautious , managerial Republican Party of yesteryear is back ! The crusading , militant and extremist Tea Party is over !\nIt \u2019 s not over in the U.S. Congress , where a shutdown-in-miniature is unfolding between the White House and the Tea Party wing of the GOP . It \u2019 s not over in Wisconsin , where a Tea Party-darling governor is slashing the state university system \u2019 s funding , changing its mission statement ( while lying about it ) , and fighting tooth and nail to humiliate people on government benefits . It \u2019 s not over in North Carolina , where a billionaire-backed Tea Party government is also going after the public university system in its effort to turn the state into Kansas . And it \u2019 s not over in South Carolina , where one state representative hopes to mainline National Rifle Association propaganda to a generation of public school students .\nLet \u2019 s stick with the South Carolina example for a moment , because I think it tells us much about the contemporary GOP \u2019 s character . According to Kimberly Johnson of Al Jazeera America , the recent decision on the part of PTR Industries , a gun manufacturer , to move its headquarters from Connecticut to South Carolina has inspired Republican state Rep. Alan Clemmons to propose what he \u2019 s calling the \u201c Second Amendment Education Act. \u201d As the name implies , the bill would \u201c provide all public elementary schools , middle schools , and high schools \u201d with \u201c instruction in the Second Amendment \u201d for no fewer than \u201c three consecutive weeks in one grading period in each academic year. \u201d The curriculum would be written by the NRA , of course .\nAnyone who does not consider Wayne LaPierre , the NRA \u2019 s frequently rabid executive vice president and chief public representative , to be a proper author of school children 's education might look on this proposal skeptically . They might wonder if it \u2019 s not exactly the kind of big government social engineering that Tea Partyers , who often accuse the left of changing the culture to reflect its worldview , usually decry . They might also worry that the bill is an example of the crony capitalism the Tea Party says it hates , with the government aiding a friendly and favored industry \u2014 or picking winners and losers , as they like to say . What the Al Jazeera report shows is that , on both counts , these fears would be correct .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a big handshake , \u201d is how PTR Industries purchasing manager Bob Grabowski described Clemmons \u2019 bill . \u201c It \u2019 s a big \u2018 hello \u2019 . \u201d He recounted how his company was treated by South Carolina locals , who are desperate for good-paying jobs in a state where the unemployment rate remains significantly higher than the national average . He and his co-workers were made to feel , he said , like \u201c rock stars. \u201d He praised Clemmons for his support of PTR ; he said the lawmaker \u201c really went to bat \u201d on its behalf . He loves the bill Clemmons came up with , too : \u201c I think it \u2019 s an awesome idea , \u201d he said , more of \u201c a handshake \u201d to his industry than \u201c a nod. \u201d Why ?
