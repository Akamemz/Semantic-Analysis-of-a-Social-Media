While the timing of his announcement was a surprise , lawmakers have been privately weighing the odds of the two front-runners , Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R. , Calif. ) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R. , La . ) to replace him .\nMr. Ryan \u2019 s planned departure could add to the headwinds already buffeting the Republicans as the midterm elections approach because it is likely to weaken his power to raise money for the party .\n\u201c This is a public acknowledgment that the House is really , really gone , \u201d said Dan Eberhart , a GOP donor and chief executive of a Colorado-based drilling services company . \u201c Ryan has unzipped a deluge of donors that are now going to be focused more than they were on the Senate . \u2019 \u2019\nSince 1994 , the president \u2019 s party has lost an average of 23 seats in the House midterm elections . The GOP this year is further burdened by President Donald Trump \u2019 s low approval rating and the planned retirements by an unusually large number of House Republicans , although many are hoping a strong economy will provide a boost for their party .\nMr. Ryan \u2019 s announcement brings to 38 the number of House Republican incumbents not seeking re-election , and the nonpartisan Cook Political Report Wednesday downgraded the chances the GOP would hold his Wisconsin seat in the November election . The filing deadline is June 1 , so Mr. Ryan \u2019 s decision allows some time for another Republican to get in position to run ; two Democrats are already in the race , including one that has raised millions .\nDemocrats need a net gain of 23 House seats to win the majority . They have identified many more targets than that , including 23 districts now held by House Republicans that were captured by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 .\n\u201c If the election were held next week , we \u2019 d be in deep trouble , \u2019 \u2019 said former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich . \u201c As things stand right now , we would lose .

Mark Meadows ( R. , N.C. ) , chairman of the House Freedom Caucus , a group of conservative House Republicans expected to play an influential role in selecting the next House GOP leader .\nRep. Bradley Byrne ( R. , Ala. ) , who attended a lunch with the speaker Wednesday , said if Mr. Ryan left early it could \u201c jeopardize \u201d the party \u2019 s chances of keeping the majority this year . \u201c The last thing we need have between now and the midterm elections is some sort of scramble for who \u2019 s going to be our leader , \u201d he said .\nHow the House Could Change Hands Control of the U.S. House of Representatives turns on a handful of the 435 districts . Here \u2019 s why those races are competitive .\nMr. McCarthy is next in line to succeed Mr. Ryan . Lawmakers and House GOP aides said Wednesday the first question is whether the affable California Republican can sew up enough support . Mr. McCarthy withdrew from the 2015 speaker race . He now has among the closest relationships of any lawmaker with Mr. Trump , its isn \u2019 t yet clear if conservatives will coalesce around him .\nHis allies said he has worked harder and built stronger relationships with House Republicans since 2015 . As the lawmaker in charge of scheduling bills for House floor votes , Mr. McCarthy has helped many of his colleagues score more minor legislative wins that matter to them at home and on the campaign trail .\n\u201c He \u2019 s in a different spot than where he was three years ago , \u201d said Rep. Bill Huizenga ( R. , Mich. ) After Mr. McCarthy withdrew from the last race , \u201c he could have said \u2018 a pox upon all of you , \u2019 and he didn \u2019 t do that . He did the opposite . \u201d\nBut conservatives , who had been previously suspicious of Mr. McCarthy \u2019 s policy leanings , will play an even larger role in selecting the next GOP leader , because so many centrist Republicans are planning to retire and more could lose their seats in November .\nIf Mr. McCarthy \u2019 s ascent again stalls , Mr. Scalise would likely become the lead candidate to succeed Mr. Ryan . An increasingly frequent presence on national television , Mr. Scalise \u2019 s national profile has soared and his emotional connection with the House GOP intensified after he survived a shooting of congressional Republicans at a baseball practice last June .\nMr. Ryan didn \u2019 t throw his support behind either of his deputies Wednesday , though he said he would have more to say on the subject in the coming days .\nAfter spending nearly 20 years in Congress , Mr. Ryan said Wednesday that he had decided to leave because he had accomplished many of his legislative goals and did not want to be a \u201c Sunday dad \u201d who only spent one day a week with his children in Wisconsin .\nMr. Ryan played a central role in the passage of the 2017 tax overhaul , Mr. Trump \u2019 s biggest legislative achievement .

Its passage marked a personal redemption for him and congressional Republicans after a bruising year in which the House was barely able to achieve its long-sought repeal of the 2010 health law , and the effort ultimately faltered in the Senate .\n\u201c We have achieved a heck of a lot , \u201d said Mr. Ryan , singling out the tax overhaul .
