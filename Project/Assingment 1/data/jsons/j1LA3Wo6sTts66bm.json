And their voices should compel us to change .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s even one thing we can do to reduce this violence , if there \u2019 s even one life we can save , we have an obligation to try it . \u201d\nMr. Obama signed executive directives with 23 steps that he said his administration can take without action by Congress , including better information-sharing among federal agencies , educating gun owners on safety and assuring doctors that they can legally ask patients whether they own firearms .\nHis proposals signal the beginning of the first major gun debate in years . If he is successful , it would be the first such legislation to pass in Washington in two decades .\nBut some key Democrats were cool to his ideas , and many Republicans \u2014 who control the House of Representatives \u2014 warned of a bitter fight ahead , saying Mr. Obama is disregarding the Second Amendment \u2019 s guarantee of the right to bear arms .\n\u201c Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook , \u201d said Sen.
