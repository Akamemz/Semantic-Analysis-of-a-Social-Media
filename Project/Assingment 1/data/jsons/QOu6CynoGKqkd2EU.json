Thursday evening , just ahead of Saturday 's South Carolina primary and the 14 key Super Tuesday races next week .\nNear the bottom in the polls in South Carolina , Klobuchar came out swinging at both President Trump and Democratic frontrunner Bernie Sanders . She charged that the White House has n't done enough to contain the coronavirus outbreak , minutes after a whistleblower surfaced alleging that The Department of Health and Human Services may have recklessly exposed its own workers to the deadly virus .\n`` This is such a serious matter , '' Klobuchar said , insisting that she wanted people to `` take the politics out of it . '' Within seconds , though , she attacked President Trump for proposing to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) -- funding reductions that have n't taken effect .\n`` I just do n't think we can isolate ourselves from the rest of the world , '' Klobuchar said . `` I believe in science , I believe in not silencing health professionals . '' She added : `` We 're gon na have to have the funding on a federal level . The president has n't really proposed an amount . ''\nSpecifically , Klobuchar said she `` thought that was a very messy situation with the 14 people off the cruise that we later found out they were infected and they ended up on the plane . ... That should 've been handled differently . ''\nAP FACT CHECK POINTS OUT LEADING DEMS ' ARE SIMPLY WRONG ABOUT CDC FUNDING CLAIMS\nPressed by Fox News ' Bret Baier about where she stood on a widely panned op-ed in The New York Times saying coronavirus should be called `` Trumpvirus , '' Klobuchar demurred : `` I think there 's a lot of frustration there with not requesting the funding . ... I think you 're seeing that bubbling up . He said $ 1 billion , but Congress thinks it should be $ 8 billion , but then she said Congress should decide . ''\nKlobuchar , who posted an unexpectedly strong third-place finish in New Hampshire 's primary but fell to sixth place in the Nevada caucuses , has sought to boost her support among centrists in less delegate-rich states that other candidates have n't showered with attention . Her campaign has also committed to a $ 4.2 million advertisement buy in Super Tuesday states .\nAt the Fox News Town Hall , hosted by Baier and Martha MacCallum , Klobuchar acknowledged she does n't have the `` biggest bank account '' in the raise , but touted her newspaper endorsements and noted jokingly that she has more delegates than Mike Bloomberg .\nBIDEN AHEAD IN S.C. -- WHO IS IN THE RUNNING FOR 2ND PLACE ?\nThe event comes days after Klobuchar aggressively took on Sanders at Tuesday night 's rowdy primary debate , saying his sweeping government plans simply are n't affordable . The one-hour event will offer Klobuchar another opportunity to dent the self-described democratic socialist 's increasingly strong path to the nomination .\nAt the town hall , Klobuchar again took aim at Sanders , noting as she did during the debate that `` all of Bernie 's plans combined -- - have been estimated to cost $ 60 trillion . That 's three times the cost of the entire U.S. economy . Not just the federal government . ''\nAsked about Sanders ' anti-fracking platform , which could alienate key moderate and union voters in swing states like Pennsylvania , Klobuchar emphasized that her administration would focus on alternative green solutions , such as imposing a carbon tax and cutting down on steel dumping .\nThe Minnesota senator sought to appeal to a more centrist position on abortion , as well , stopping short of Sanders ' stated position that pro-life Democrats have no place in the party . ( \u201c I think being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat , \u201d Sanders said this year . \u201c By this time in history . . . when we talk about what a Democrat is , I think being pro-choice is an essential part of that . '' )\n`` I am strongly pro-choice -- I always have been , '' Klobuchar said . `` Just as I think there 's a place in our party for a pro-life Democrat , there 's also a place in my support for pro-choice Republican . So , you look at a candidate and you make a decision , even though you do n't agree with them on every single thing . ''\n`` Yes , there are pro-life elected officials in the Democratic Party , and that 's OK , '' Klobuchar added , saying she disagrees with Trump on defunding Planned Parenthood .\nPressed by MacCallum on Democrats ' recent opposition to the so-called `` Born Alive '' bill , which would establish criminal and professional consequences for physicians who do n't provide a normal standard of care to babies that survive abortions , Klobuchar dismissed Republican efforts to pass the legislation .\n`` I would 've voted with the Democrats on that , because I think Roe v. Wade is now the law of the land , and I think a lot of these bills are attempts to change that . ''\nKlobuchar separately declined to push for Elizabeth Warren to further explain her past , conflicting claims of Native American ancestry , saying Warren has adequately addressed the issue .\nAt a Fox News Town Hall last May , Klobuchar emphasized that her brand of relatively moderate progressive politics stood the most chance of actually achieving results ( `` The last time I checked , if you want to be a progressive and support progressives , then you 're supposed to make progress , '' Klobuchar said . ) She also asserted that universal health care was a `` privilege and not a right , '' and intimated that there were some aspects of President Trump 's tax bill that she would retain .\n\u201c What happens in South Carolina does matter , mostly because of what the coverage is going to be over the three days leading up to Super Tuesday .
