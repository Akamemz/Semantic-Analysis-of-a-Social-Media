In a deal negotiated during 18 months of secret talks hosted largely by Canada and encouraged by Pope Francis , who hosted a final meeting at the Vatican , Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba agreed in a telephone call to put aside decades of hostility to find a new relationship between the United States and the island nation just 90 miles off the American coast . \u201c We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a nationally televised statement from the White House .

If we remove the barriers to communication , we will speed the forces of change . Just as was the case in Eastern Europe as a result of the Helsinki agreements , the Cuban people will be empowered by human contact , the free flow of information , and the support and encouragement of Americans and Cuban Americans from Florida to California . If U.S. policy can deal with Cuba -- not as a domestic political issue -- but as one sovereign state to another , then we will resume official diplomatic relations with the exchange of ambassadors and begin -- once again -- to talk about matters that affect the well being and security of both our countries , namely migration , anti-narcotics , health and the environment . Starting a dialogue will allow us to press Cuba 's leaders to respect the principles that we and the region hold dear : human rights , rule of law and freedom . Removing the barriers to communications and to normal diplomatic relations are not concessions as some would claim . Rather , they are practical initiatives that will reduce the dependence of the Cuban people on the Cuban state by providing them with alternative sources of information and resources to improve their daily lives .
