We simply don\u2019t know.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, the judge answered only two of the jury\u2019s four questions.\n\nThe jury has proposed these 4 questions:\n\nQ: Is one required to file an FBAR if they own less than 50% of the company and no signatory authority?\n\nQ: Define \"shelf company\"?\n\nQ: Can you redefine reasonable doubt?\n\nQ: Can the exhibit list be amended to include the indictment? https://t.co/CXfriveti7 \u2014 Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) August 16, 2018\n\nThe FBAR question: One question was about a set of charges related to Manafort\u2019s offshore accounts that contained tens of millions of dollars \u2014 prosecutors charged him with four counts of failing to fill out a legally required form known as an FBAR (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts), to disclose his foreign holdings to the US government.\n\nNow, Manafort\u2019s holdings were structured in a complex way, and the defense argued that that should have exempted him from having to fill out FBAR forms.
