The data show the engineer cut the throttle and slammed on the brakes , but those moves came `` very late in the game , '' Weener said .\n`` This is raw data off the event recorders , so it tells us what happened . It does n't tell us why it happened , '' Weener said .\nInvestigators questioned the engineer , William Rockefeller , and the rest of the train crew on Monday . Rockefeller told investigators he applied the brakes , but the train did n't slow down , according to a law enforcement official who was at the scene and is familiar with the investigation .\nBut while the cause of the derailment has not yet been determined , investigators have seen no indication of brake problems , Weener said .\nJUST WATCHED Son : Our father was more than a victim Replay More Videos ...

The force of the crash ripped apart the rails and a section of the track bed , leaving chunks of concrete strewn about the scene .\nDavid Schanoes , a former deputy chief of field operations for the Metro-North line , said the data is `` uncannily similar '' to a July rail crash in Spain that left 79 dead\n`` I would have to see all the data from the event recorder , '' Schanoes told CNN 's Erin Burnett OutFront . `` But clearly , from what has been captured , the train was overspeeding , and the request for emergency brake application comes too late for the train to be able to negotiate the curvature . ''\nWeener said authorities will be looking at the engineer 's recent work history and will examine his mobile phone , which is now in the hands of authorities .\nIn the Spanish crash , a court found the engineer had been on the phone with railway staff when the train derailed . But a preliminary review has found no reason to believe Rockefeller was using his phone at the time of Sunday 's derailment , a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN .\nIn a statement issued Monday evening , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo said the data `` makes clear that , as we suspected , extreme speed was a central cause of this crash . ''\n`` The lives that were lost yesterday are a stark reminder that protecting the safety of all New Yorkers must be our top priority , '' Cuomo said . `` When the investigation concludes , we will make sure that any responsible parties are held accountable .

About 150 were aboard when the train derailed , authorities said .\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said the speed report `` sort of takes your breath away . ''\n`` For a train to be going 82 mph around that curve is just a frightening thought , '' said Schumer , D-New York , who appeared at a news conference with Weener . `` The fact that it was going 82 mph even in the 70-mph zones before the curve started raises so many questions and is scary . ''\nSchumer said the tracks appear to have been in good shape , and the preliminary indication is that signals were working properly -- `` but it 's premature to blame anyone or anything right now , '' he added .\nThe train was about 10 miles short of its destination , Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal , when it derailed on the approach to the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx . Despite the high speed , surviving passenger Amanda Swanson said she felt the wreck in slow motion .\n`` I was nodding off , and the thing that woke me up was my own equilibrium , '' Swanson told CNN 's Anderson Cooper 360 . `` I realized that my body was tilted very severely , and that woke me up -- and when I woke up and saw the entire cab of the train was tilted , I immediately woke up and realized that I was in the middle of a train crash . ''\nThe windows of the coaches broke out and then , `` gravel came flying up in our faces , '' said Swanson , 26 , who was on her way to work at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant . She put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble as the car she was riding in flipped over and skidded to a stop with a thud .\n`` I could n't see anything , '' she told CNN 's New Day . `` It was just smoke . ''\nWorkers lifted the rail cars back onto the tracks on Monday , and police determined no other bodies were trapped in the wreckage .
