    "content": "The gun control movement notched a public relations coup with last week \u2019 s massive school walkouts , but now school districts that pitched in to ensure the protest \u2019 s success are stuck with the rising political and legal fallout .\nA week after the March 14 walkout , school officials are grappling with complaints from parents outraged by the specter of their kids engaged in political protesting on school time , as well as reports of criminal mischief committed by teens who treated the event as a get-out-of-class-free card .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the students get to do it all again next month . A substantially identical event , also called the National School Walkout , is scheduled for April 20 , the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre .\nChris Cleveland , chairman of the Chicago Republican Party , said he worried that the walkouts , aimed at pushing for tougher gun restrictions in the wake of the deadly Parkland shooting , have provided the template for advocacy groups eager to co-opt the public schools for progressive activism .\n\u201c If they get away with this , they \u2019 ll be free to engage in any kind of political activity in the schools that they wish , \u201d said Mr. Cleveland , who has a third-grader in the Chicago Public Schools .\nThe party is moving to avert that scenario by preparing a lawsuit against the school system , arguing that the district violated state and federal law as well as its own policies by organizing a political demonstration \u2014 and pressuring students to attend \u2014 on the taxpayers \u2019 dime .\nThe district has yet to comment , but it has other problems . About 60 students from Simeon Career Academy trashed a Walmart \u201c while they were supposed to be protesting guns , \u201d an incident under investigation by police , according to Fox32 in Chicago .\nThe school system issued a statement saying it was reviewing the incident , but Mr. Cleveland said he has yet to receive a response to a letter from the party \u2019 s attorney demanding \u201c that they comply with the law . \u201d\n\u201c There will always be a few kids who don \u2019 t behave , \u201d said Mr. Cleveland . \u201c I \u2019 m a lot more concerned about the behavior of the adults . \u201d\nHe is not alone . Connecticut lawyer Deborah G. Stevenson said she has fielded calls from parents and others across the nation , including California , Illinois , Massachusetts and Rhode Island , after reports about her clash with the New Milford Public Schools .\nShe urged the district last week on behalf of several parents to cancel the high school walkout , arguing that the schools had \u201c condoned , facilitated , and supported an event that clearly advocates for students to be part of a partisan political \u2018 movement , \u2019 \u201d but the district refused .\nMs. Stevenson said her clients plan to pursue further action before the April 20 walkout .\n\u201c Parents are very , very upset about this entire situation , \u201d said Ms. Stevenson . \u201c The ones that have contacted us are trying to determine what the proper legal steps would be here . Everybody \u2019 s trying to make that determination of how and when and where to take the next step . \u201d\nWhile the schools may pay a price for the activism , gun control groups are basking in the glow of the walkout , which drew as many as 1 million students and enjoyed widespread press coverage as Democratic luminaries turned out to cheer on the youthful crowds .\nSchool officials have countered that walkouts were student-led , despite coordination by the Women \u2019 s March youth arm and Action Network , and that it was better to use the event as a learning opportunity rather than watch young people flee the classroom unsupervised .\nNew Milford Public Schools attorney Michael P. McKeon took umbrage at Ms. Stevenson \u2019 s claim that the school had engaged in politically motivated behavior , insisting that the events at New Milford High School were voluntary and student-driven .\n\u201c I am sure that your clients do not consider the murder of students in their schools \u2019 hallways to be political expression , \u201d Mr. McKeon said in a March 14 letter . \u201c Similarly , students expressing a desire to be free from the threat of carnage and death in their classrooms can hardly be deemed political speech . \u201d\nHe described the event as a \u201c student-initiated remembrance \u201d of the 17 people killed last month at Marjory Stoneman High School in Parkland , Florida , and indeed many schools billed the walkout as a memorial .\nIn some cases , that was true . In other cases , the memorials looked more like rallies , stoked by school staff and teachers acting as escorts to events and providing class time for making posters featuring anti-gun slogans .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say that every individual school district was partisan , but far and wide , it was more than just a memorial service , \u201d said Ms. Stevenson . \u201c It was a protest with signs , with taking positions , with leading students to do things , to take action , selling T-shirts on school grounds \u2014 that \u2019 s something different than a simple memorial trying to remember those who died . \u201d\nSome school officials took a light touch on penalties in support of what was described as a good cause , including Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson , who assured students the day before the walkout that \u201c We will not enact any disciplinary measures . \u201d\n\u201c We think it \u2019 s critically important that the student voice is heard at this crucial point in our history as a nation , so we \u2019 ve provided a lot of guidance to our school leaders , instructed them on how these things should be conducted , and we \u2019 ve also given them the autonomy to create the best plan at their local schools , \u201d she said in a Chicago Sun-Times video .\nJames Buchal , head of the Multnomah County Republican Party in Oregon , said Portland Public Schools parents were \u201c falsely assured that the protest was not partisan , but would constitute a memorial for those slain . \u201d\n\u201c At the protests , adult participants bragged about organizing the protest , and applauded the help they had received from PPS , \u201d Mr. Buchal said in a Tuesday statement . \u201c Organizers made materials available to support Leftist goals far beyond anti-Second Amendment advocacy . \u201d\nIn a statement , Portland Public Schools said Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero asked schools to \u201c treat the day as a \u2018 teachable moment \u2019 \u201d and \u201c structure lesson plans around the theme of safe , supportive and inclusive schools . \u201d\nOther Republicans who have decried the walkouts include South Carolina Gov .
