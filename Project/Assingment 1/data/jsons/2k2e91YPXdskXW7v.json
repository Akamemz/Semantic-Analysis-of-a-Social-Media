And it 's clear major policy differences remain . But for now , the two are trying to display unity as they prepare for a fall battle with Hillary Clinton and the Democrats .

That is why it \u2019 s critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles , advance a conservative agenda , and do all we can to win this fall , '' Trump and Ryan said in a joint statement following their hourlong meeting . Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus hosted the session .\n`` While we were honest about our few differences , we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground . We will be having additional discussions , but remain confident there \u2019 s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall , and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal .\nRyan and Trump added : `` This was our first meeting , but it was a very positive step toward unification .
