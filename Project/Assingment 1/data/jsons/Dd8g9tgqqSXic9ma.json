Without more pay raises spreading across the economy, the Fed has less pressure to raise a key short-term rate from its record low near zero.\n\n\n\nSo why hasn't vigorous hiring led to better paydays?\n\n\n\nThree factors help explain the unusual trend:\n\n\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO GO EVEN LOWER\n\n\n\nThe last time monthly wage growth outpaced inflation in any meaningful way was from mid-2006 through 2007, just before the Great Recession started. The unemployment rate then ranged between 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent. If that pattern holds true, unemployment would have to drop another full percentage point from its current 5.9 percent before wages break out of their funk.\n\n\n\nEconomists note that wages are generally a \"lagging\" indicator.
