    "content": "The Trump administration was handed a devastating defeat on a signature policy last week \u2014 and it barely registered .\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling against Trump \u2019 s modified travel ban \u2014 depriving the administration of its best chance to get a favorable ruling before the case goes to the Supreme Court ( as it \u2019 s widely assumed it will ) . Trump did not tweet about it when he got home from Europe . The administration did not issue a testy press release .\nIn the early weeks of the administration , the travel ban \u2014 which temporarily prevented people from a handful of Muslim-majority countries , and nearly all refugees , from entering the United States \u2014 was the signal accomplishment of a White House that promised , for better or worse , to transform America .\nNow it \u2019 s been a policy failure for longer than it was ever a policy success . But politically , something arguably worse has happened . It \u2019 s been nearly forgotten .\nWhen the travel ban was first put on hold in February , it was a symbol of the haste and carelessness with which an underprepared and understaffed administration had leapt into the job . When the revised version was put out in March , it was the keystone of an administration effort to reboot a flailing policy agenda . And when that version was put on hold , on the evening before it was due to go into effect , it was a reminder that the divisive populism of the Trump candidacy would inevitably haunt the Trump presidency .\nThe ever-expanding scandal over the ties between Trump allies and the Russian government , not to mention the Republican-controlled Congress \u2019 s efforts to potentially disrupt health insurance for tens of millions , hasn \u2019 t left much room for national media to discuss the travel ban .\nThe Trump administration \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 has shown very little ability to redirect public attention . It looks , for all the world , as if the travel ban has fallen out of mind for the White House because it \u2019 s fallen out of sight of national TV news . Because at this point , the news doesn \u2019 t react to Donald Trump as much as Donald Trump reacts to the news .\nThe latest travel ban ruling barely made a blip on the media \u2019 s radar \u2014 so Trump has dropped it too\nHere \u2019 s a chart , pulled from the analytics site IQ Media , monitoring use of the phrase \u201c travel ban \u201d on nationally broadcast television from January 26 ( the day before the first version of the ban was signed ) to May 30 , 2017 . ( The term \u201c Muslim ban , \u201d which is also used to refer to the executive orders , shows similar peaks and valleys of frequency , though it \u2019 s less common than \u201c travel ban . \u201d )\nNational TV still cares , a little bit , when something happens in the travel ban fight . The spikes in the chart above correlate roughly to major developments in the introduction or implementation of each version of the ban , or to developments in the subsequent lawsuits against them .\nBut the spikes aren \u2019 t nearly as high as they used to be .\nFor one thing , there \u2019 s less interest in the second version of the travel ban than there was in the first : The last time more than 100 national TV segments mentioned the travel ban was March 6 , when the second version was introduced . That \u2019 s logical : Unlike the initial travel ban , the revised ban has never actually been in effect , and at a certain point it \u2019 s no longer news that federal judges don \u2019 t agree with the Trump administration about the constitutionality of an executive order that in practice would overwhelmingly target Muslim visitors and immigrants to the US .\nBut that explanation falls apart when it comes to the past month of news coverage . While outcomes of cases tend to be much more newsworthy than oral arguments when courts hear a case , that hasn \u2019 t been the situation at all . National news paid much more attention to the oral argument in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals , on May 8 , than to the actual ruling made by that court on May 26 . ( It paid roughly the same amount of attention to oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit , on May 15 , as it did to the Fourth Circuit \u2019 s actual ruling . )\nHere \u2019 s the piece of information that makes that fall into place : May 9 , the day after the much-covered oral argument , was the day that Donald Trump fired James Comey . And since then , the news cycle has never been the same .\nThe daily rhythm of political life under the Trump administration is no longer driven by what the White House says or does , or what happens to it . It \u2019 s driven by the constant churn of scoops , leaks , denials , and revelations , as new connections between team Trump and the Russian government come to light and government investigations scramble to ( or are stonewalled from ) getting to the bottom of it .\nTrump is fundamentally unable to change the narrative because he \u2019 s reacting to what he sees\nThis isn \u2019 t to say that Donald Trump couldn \u2019 t garner plenty of media attention for tweeting something inflammatory about the judges who ruled against the travel ban in the Fourth Circuit .
