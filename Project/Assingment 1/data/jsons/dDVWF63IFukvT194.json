    "content": "With the lame-duck Congress failing to advance bipartisan surveillance-reform legislation , President Obama faces an uphill climb next year with his plans to end the National Security Agency \u2019 s mass collection of phone records .\nThe contentious debate will be renewed in the new Congress as Republicans take control of the Senate , after senators fell two votes short of the 60 needed to proceed on the USA Freedom Act on Nov. 15 . Administration aides are saying they don \u2019 t expect any more attempts to bring back the bill this year .\nBut analysts say Mr. Obama does have one bit of leverage with Republicans : The current law authorizing the NSA \u2019 s bulk collection of phone records expires on June 1 , and many GOP lawmakers want to keep the program in some fashion .\n\u201c The clock is ticking on authorization , \u201d said Mike Daniels , a specialist on technology and security at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute . \u201c The government clearly needs to do some of this [ data collection ] to protect the country . Clearly the NSA and the intel community want it desperately . \u201d\nSo do powerful Republicans such as incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , who argued that the USA Freedom Act would have curtailed the government \u2019 s counterterrorism operations .\nThe White House didn \u2019 t respond to inquiries about the administration \u2019 s plans for resurrecting the legislation .\nThe proposal , supported by the administration , would have banned the bulk collection of Americans \u2019 phone records in the wake of the infamous revelations by fugitive NSA contractor Edward Snowden . The bill would have required the government to show reasonable suspicion that a target of surveillance is associated with international terrorism .\nThe measure also would have limited the scope of data collection by not allowing the government to collect records relating to a geographic region or a particular service provider .\nAnother factor playing into the debate is the widespread concern in recent months about the potential for \u201c lone wolf \u201d terrorists inspired and/or trained by the Islamic State group to launch attacks on the U.S .\n\u201c Those expiring provisions are going to provide the kind of pressure or wedge issue that surveillance advocates just might need to be able to actually get a deal , \u201d said Patrick Eddington , a former CIA analyst and a specialist on civil liberties at the Cato Institute . \u201c That \u2019 s where this is going to play itself out . \u201d\nThe NSA and the intelligence community are most concerned with losing the authority to conduct \u201c roving wiretaps \u201d if the current law expires , he said .\n\u201c With the proliferation now of smartphones and tablets and other mobile devices , law enforcement needs the ability ultimately to keep tabs on particular individuals that they believe are suspects , \u201d he said .\nMr. Eddington said privacy advocates still plan to push for tougher amendments such as a prohibition of taxpayer money to search the Section 702 database of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which contains the contents of Americans \u2019 communications picked up by NSA overseas collection while targeting foreigners .\nA bipartisan coalition in the House failed in an effort to include it in the legislation earlier this year .\nSome lawmakers also are expected to renew the call to prohibit the use of taxpayer money to force technology companies to build in , deliberately , \u201c back doors \u201d into their systems to facilitate surveillance .
