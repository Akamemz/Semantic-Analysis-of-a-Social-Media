    "content": "Hillary Clinton is about to have her big trade moment .\nThe likely 2016 presidential candidate has yet to show her hand on whether she supports the latest effort to pass \u201c fast track \u201d trade promotion authority , but that could happen as soon as Monday morning when she takes the stage with prominent labor leaders at a Washington event put on by a liberal-leaning political think tank .\nWhat she says there \u2014 or in coming weeks \u2014 could improve or imperil her position with unions , Democratic colleagues in Congress , the business community and the sitting president .\nIf she comes out for fast track , it will alienate her labor and environmental base . If she opposes the legislation , it puts her at odds with President Barack Obama and her previous support as secretary of state for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement , opening her to charges of being a flip-flopper .\nProgressive Democrats urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to get in the presidential race want Clinton to clarify her position as early as possible , given pending action in Congress on a \u201c fast track \u201d trade promotion authority bill , said Neil Sroka , a spokesman for Democracy for America , the group founded by former Vermont Gov . Howard Dean .\n\u201c There is no doubt that the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the fight over fast track is going to be part of the presidential election , \u201d given the expectation that Clinton and others could declare their candidacy in April , the same month fast track could hit the Senate floor , Sroka said .\n\u201c It very well might be some of the first questions she is asked as a presidential candidate could be about TPP and fast track , \u201d Sroka added . \u201c There \u2019 s lots of reasons that people are excited about getting Elizabeth Warren into the presidential race , but her outspokenness in the battle against TPP \u2026 is something that speaks to the progressive base \u2019 s concerns and is attracting people to this campaign . \u201d\nUnion groups , including the AFL-CIO labor federation , also have deep concerns about the prospective trade pact with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific that , along with the United States , represent more than 40 percent of world gross domestic product . They fear the deal will encourage companies to move more jobs overseas , suppressing wages in the United States .\nClinton , as Obama \u2019 s secretary of state , is closely associated with the agreement , which could grow to cover 21 economies in the region , including China . \u201c Our hope is that a TPP agreement with high standards can serve as a benchmark for future agreements \u2014 and grow to serve as a platform for broader regional interaction and eventually a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific , \u201d she wrote in October 2011 .\nThe issue is front and center as Obama pushes for approval of trade promotion authority , a bill that would allow him to submit trade agreements , like the proposed TPP , to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote without any amendments . The next president , whoever it is , could also use the authority to negotiate a deal bringing China into the pact .\nThe Obama administration is already negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China that could be a stepping stone to a free trade pact . In addition , the United States , China and others in the region recently agreed on a path , known as the Beijing Roadmap , to pursue the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific .\nThat raises the stakes of the current fight in Congress over trade promotion authority , which is also known as fast track because of its expedited voting procedures that union groups and many progressive Democrats detest .\nClinton \u2019 s husband , former President Bill Clinton , used the procedure to win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute blames for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs .\n\u201c Every single thing in our trade deals should be openly discussed and subject to public oversight and the full legislative process , \u201d AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a recent speech . \u201c There should be no question about that . Fast track is wrong and undemocratic . It \u2019 s a rotten process , and the American labor movement intends to kill it . \u201d\nAlthough administration officials insist it \u2019 s not part of their calculus , finishing congressional action on the pact this year could be a big help to Clinton \u2014 particularly if rivals on the left , such as Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , were to enter the 2016 race , both of whom have criticized the TPP pact and fast-track trade legislation .\nClinton voted against the fast-track legislation the last time it was approved in 2002 , although her husband repeatedly pushed for the same authority when he was president .\nNow , Obama \u2014 another erstwhile critic of trade agreements \u2014 wants Congress to approve the legislation quickly so he can wrap up the TPP pact and submit it to Congress for a vote later this year .\nClinton \u2019 s office did not respond to an emailed request for her current position on trade issues .\nAlthough she has been quiet on trade since stepping down as secretary of state in early 2013 , Clinton was a vocal advocate of the TPP agreement while in office and also pushed for congressional approval of free trade deals with South Korea , Colombia and Panama opposed by many Democrats , particularly in the House of Representatives .\n\u201c Our landmark deal with South Korea could increase exports of American goods by more than $ 10 billion and grow South Korea \u2019 s economy by 6 percent , \u201d Clinton said in a speech in Vladivostok , Russia , in September 2012 , relying on U.S. government estimates that , at least in the early years of the Korea agreement , appear now to be too optimistic .\n\u201c In addition to lowering tariffs , the agreement also includes improvements on intellectual property protection and enforcement , fair labor practices , environmental protection , regulatory due process , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c That \u2019 s also true of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a new far-reaching regional trade agreement that will bring together at least 11 economies , developed and developing alike , into a single Pacific trading community . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s embrace of the TPP agreement show how far both she and Obama had come on trade since the 2008 Democratic primary , when the two rivals and former Sen. John Edwards repeatedly used the North American Free Trade Agreement as a punching bag to whip up votes among union supporters .\nAlthough Clinton \u2019 s husband pushed NAFTA through Congress early in his administration , and went on to win congressional approval of a world trade agreement in 1994 and permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000 , Hillary promised a \u201c timeout \u201d from new trade agreements and a smarter approach to trade policy if elected in 2008 .\nSeven years later , the same issues are playing out as Obama is pushing to win approval of trade promotion authority .\nLast month , the AFL-CIO executive council approved a moratorium on political donations to candidates for federal office to focus its resources on defeating TPA , a pointed reminder to Democrats of its fundraising abilities .\nOn Monday , Clinton will be sharing the stage with leaders of two unions represented on the council , Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers , and Lee Saunders , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , for a roundtable discussion on revitalizing urban communities .\nAfter voting against trade promotion authority in 2002 , Clinton supported most of the agreements negotiated by President George W. Bush over the next six years , with the notable exception of a free trade deal with Central American countries and the Dominican Republican in 2005 . That controversial agreement , which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called a \u201c job killer , \u201d was fiercely opposed by most Democrats\n\u201c But Obama and Clinton were hard nos on CAFTA , \u201d said Scott Miller , a senior adviser on trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who previously was director of global trade policy at the consumer products giant Proctor & Gamble . \u201c They were never even close to yeses . \u201d\nThe two rivals also skipped a vote on the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement in December 2007 , as did Sen. John McCain , who won the Republican presidential nomination the following year .\nDuring the 2008 Democratic primary race , both Obama and Clinton took \u201c what I would characterize as a populist turn [ on trade ] , particularly during the Pennsylvania and the Ohio primaries , but the candidates tried hard not to get too far from each other , \u201d Miller said .\nOne memorable moment came during a debate in Cleveland , when both Obama and Clinton said they would use the threat of withdrawing from NAFTA to force Mexico to negotiate stronger labor and environmental terms for the agreement .\n\u201c I think actually Sen. Clinton \u2019 s answer on this one is right , \u201d Obama said . \u201c I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced . \u201d\nObama never followed through on that idea after he was elected president .\nBut both Mexico and Canada are part of the negotiations on the TPP pact , which the Obama administration says will upgrade the labor and environmental provisions of NAFTA by making them enforceable .\nStill , the Obama administration \u2019 s effort to portray TPP as \u201c the most progressive \u201d trade agreement to date has not changed many minds on the left .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no reason to believe the TPP is going to be a better deal than NAFTA was for the American middle class , \u201d Sroka said . \u201c I think the base of the party wants to have a nominee in 2016 that reflects concern with the trade deals and what trade deals have done to working families . \u201d",
