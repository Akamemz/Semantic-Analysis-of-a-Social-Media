In polls, Americans are generally reluctant to see cuts in those major entitlement programs. They don\u2019t call Social Security or Medicare \u201cthe problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrumbell makes two basic arguments here. Let's examine each:\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Revenues may reach a numerical high this year, but they'll still be lower than the historical average, as a percentage of the economy. This is true; although, as he notes, we'll likely hit that multi-decade equilibrium next year. But as Philip Klein reported last month, the CBO projects revenues to zoom past the historical average over the next decade, yet deficits will continue to explode the national debt. By the end of the current budget window, the annual deficit will climb back into the trillion-dollar range -- again, despite higher-than-average revenues (as a percentage of GDP), much higher raw revenues (in dollars), and much lower defense spending (also as a percentage of GDP). Klein added this perspective:\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that new tax revenue will be drastically outpacing growth in the defense budget, the nation is still projected to accumulate an additional $7 trillion in deficits over the next 10-year period, bringing the public debt to $20 trillion. The cause of that debt, therefore, cannot be taxes that are too low or defense spending that's too high. In fact, by 2020, Congress could vote to eliminate all military spending and it wouldn't even be enough to cover interest payments on the national debt.\n\n\n\n(2) Even though the rudimentary arithmetic confirms that overspending -- not undertaxing -- is fueling our debt crisis, public polling indicates that the public isn't willing to identify popular, expensive programs as the problem. On one hand, the American people do recognize the government's spending problem and are demanding spending restraint. On the other, Trumbell is right: Most people have little appetite for even modest reforms to the entitlement programs whose unfunded liabilities threaten to swamp the solvency of the country. But a poll that says a lot of people don't want to call Medicare's unpaid-for promises a problem does not negate the fact that they are. Public opinion matters a lot in politics, but it is not the arbiter of empirical reality. Trumbell writes that spending is the problem \"in one sense.\" Yeah, the math one.",
