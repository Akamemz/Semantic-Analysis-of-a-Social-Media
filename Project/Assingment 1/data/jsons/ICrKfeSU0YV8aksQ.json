    "content": "The committee room where the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to take place in Washington , U.S. ( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\nDemocrats rolled out two articles of impeachment against President Trump on Tuesday , alleging abuse of power and obstruction .\nAs noted over the weekend , I had to correct myself when writing that the impeachment inquiry that led to this point was a \u201c rush to judgment. \u201d The judgment was made long ago . The president has been Impeached Man Walking for \u201c The Resistance \u201d since before he took the oath of office . The House proceedings have been a matter of rushing the process until it catches up to a judgment of three years \u2019 standing .\nThe two impeachment articles were produced by the House Judiciary Committee , chaired by Jerry Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) , cribbing from the report spearheaded by Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff ( D. , Calif. ) . The abuse-of-power allegation is confined to the Ukraine episode , a kerfuffle that emerged three months ago and was promptly magnified into a scandal . The claim of obstruction relates to the president \u2019 s refusal to cooperate with the partisan impeachment inquiry , the outcome of which was foreordained even as Democrats refused for weeks to conduct a vote endorsing it \u2014 for fear of antagonizing voters , which , of course , would not be a fear if there were an obvious , egregious impeachable offense .\nIt was the lack of an identifiable crime that settled Democrats on \u201c abuse of power , \u201d taking advantage of the fact that the Framers did not require a penal offense for impeachment . . . but ignoring the Framers \u2019 caution against an ambiguous standard that would invite politicized impeachments based on trifling misconduct . Here , Democrats say the abuse involves Trump \u2019 s converting of presidential power to his \u201c personal political benefit \u201d \u2014 recall the mantra of placing \u201c self above country , \u201d which was chanted throughout Monday \u2019 s farcical Judiciary Committee hearing ( an often catty partisan duel , mainly between staff attorneys , with no testimony from actual fact witnesses ) .\nTrump \u2019 s abuse of power is said to have three components : The president ( a ) exploited his foreign-relations power to pressure a foreign nation to meddle in American domestic politics ; ( b ) undermined our democratic elections ; and ( c ) endangered national security . Each is problematic .\nA . Pressuring a Foreign Power to Meddle in U.S . Politics\nDemocrats maintain that Trump pushed for Ukrainian investigations of the Bidens and Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election solely for his personal political gain . Even accepting ( as I do ) that Trump \u2019 s main motivation on the Bidens was damage to a likely political foe , the argument is still flawed .\nIt \u2019 s not like the president was asking Ukraine to make up corruption evidence out of whole cloth \u2014 as Schiff disingenuously claimed in his \u201c parody \u201d performance of the Trump\u2013Zelensky call . There is , for example , more reason to suspect Biden-family self-dealing in Ukraine ( among other places ) than there was to suspect a Trump cyberespionage conspiracy with Russia \u2014 which our government zealously investigated for years , complete with surveillance warrants , confidential informants , and a special counsel probe .\nFurthermore , Trump \u2019 s request for Kyiv \u2019 s help in investigating Democratic collusion with Ukraine in the 2016 campaign is not , as the impeachment article implies , limited to the debunked theory that Ukraine , rather than Russia , hacked the DNC . There is also significant evidence of Ukrainian government officials \u2019 working with Democrats to harm Trump \u2019 s campaign . The fact that this election interference was not as \u201c systematic \u201d as Russia \u2019 s ( as Democrats and their media note-takers point out ) does not erase the fact that it was meddling . Furthermore , even the discredited theory that Trump mentioned to Zelensky is best understood as Trump \u2019 s effort to dispel suspicions that he colluded with Russia in 2016 , not an effort to get a leg up in the 2020 race .\nThe claims that Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in our domestic politics and thus undermined our elections bump up against the stubborn fact that , in the end , nothing of consequence happened . Yes , Trump delayed defense aid and a coveted White House visit for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky . Yet Kyiv got its aid and barely noticed any delay . Trump correctly points out that he did not pressure Zelensky in their July 25 conversation , Zelensky says he never felt any pressure , and Trump gave Zelensky an audience \u2014 albeit in New York City at the high-profile U.N. meeting , not yet at the White House .\nWith such sparse evidence of wrongdoing , Democrats try inflating it with three dubious claims .\nDemocrats insist that Trump transferred the aid only because he got caught \u2014 i.e. , the \u201c whistleblower \u201d complaint purportedly prompted Trump to abandon the scheme . But this is anything but clear . Trump had other reasons , besides pushing for investigations , to delay aid to one of the world \u2019 s most corrupt countries , and he was getting pushed by Russia hawks in the administration and on Capitol Hill to make the transfer .\nIt could be that his well-founded reservations about aid for Ukraine were overcome by persuasive arguments . It could be that the whistleblower complaint influenced him . It could be both . Or neither . Regardless , what matters is that he transferred the aid . The rationale for doing so is less important than the act . On that score , Schiff \u2019 s claim that merely delaying the $ 391 million is just as bad as denying it would have been is self-evidently absurd .\nb. Trump Cared Only about an Announcement , Not an Investigation\nDemocrats further maintain that Trump did not care whether Ukraine actually conducted a Biden investigation as long as Zelensky announced one . This purportedly puts the lie to Trump \u2019 s claim that he was motivated by anti-corruption concerns .\nThis theory has become conventional wisdom . Republicans not only failed to rebut it ; at times , they tried to argue it as a point in Trump \u2019 s favor ( see , he didn \u2019 t mean Biden any real harm ! ) . Nonetheless , the theory misstates the evidence . Trump was not saying he didn \u2019 t care whether the corruption investigation happened ; he was saying he would not release the defense aid until Zelensky made the announcement of the investigation . Plainly , his calculation was that a public commitment would ensure that Zelensky would feel compelled to follow through with an investigation \u2014 hence Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2019 s testimony that Trump wanted Zelensky \u201c in a public box . \u201d\nIn any event , Trump stood down , the defense aid was transferred , and no Ukrainian announcement was required . Again , much ado about nothing .\nThird , and most speciously , Democrats claim that delaying the aid emboldened Russia \u2014 with some Democrats even suggesting that Trump \u2019 s delay may be responsible for Ukrainians \u2019 being killed in the thrumming border conflict .\nIn truth , the Ukrainians barely knew that there was an aid delay , and there is no evidence that the holdup caused mat\u00e9riel shortages on the battlefield ( aid is released to Ukraine in stages over years of time ) . Moreover , Democrats and their \u201c policy community \u201d allies refuse to come to terms with the fact that , for better or worse , the elected president makes foreign policy . If the president decides to revisit foreign-aid grants , that \u2019 s his call , even if Washington \u2019 s beloved , selfless , progressive \u2014 and unelected \u2014 policy professionals think doing so is harmful . Finally , while President Obama dithered as Russia seized Crimea in 2014 , his successor has increased the lethality of Ukrainian defense aid over what Obama provided . The Democrats \u2019 pearl-clutching over Ukraine \u2014 even as they accuse Trump of pearl-clutching over corruption \u2014 is something to behold .\nDemocrats allege not only that Trump was attempting to undermine the 2020 election by soliciting foreign interference , but that he remains a continuing threat to do so \u2014 the latter being their rationale for the supposed imperative of impeaching him now rather than letting the American people decide his fate in the election less than eleven months from now .\n1 . Nothing Happened . . . and Biden Does Not Have Immunity\nThe flaws in this claim are obvious . As already recounted , Trump dropped the matter : Ukraine got its aid , Zelensky got a POTUS meeting , and no investigations ( or announcement thereof ) were required . Plus , the Democrats \u2019 claim hinges on such fictions as the assertion that Trump was asking Ukraine to fabricate a case against Biden .\nRunning for president does not give Joe Biden immunity from inquiry into colorable suspicions of corruption , even if , as a collateral political consequence , the inquiry could help Trump and hurt Biden . If \u201c high crimes and misdemeanors \u201d now includes factoring domestic politics into dubious foreign-policy decisions ( see , e.g. , Obama \u2019 s withdrawal of troops from Iraq ) , maybe , to save time , we should start impeaching presidents before they take office \u2014 because every one of them will surely be impeachable .\nEven with the media cover they enjoy , the Democrats \u2019 audacity in lodging this claim of corrupting elections against Trump is remarkable . Each new Russia-gate revelation elucidates that the Obama administration , in collusion with foreign governments , used the executive branch \u2019 s investigative powers in the service of the Democrats \u2019 2016 campaign . The Ukraine misadventure is amateur hour compared with the Trump-Russia investigation \u2014 to which Democrats reacted not by condemning interference in our elections but by demanding a special counsel to straitjacket Trump \u2019 s administration .\nFinally , Democrats claim President Trump poses a continuing threat to facilitate foreign interference in elections due to what they portray as a pattern begun in 2016 . That \u2019 s when candidate Trump purportedly encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton . The inanity of this suggestion has not stopped it from being investigated by the special-counsel staff that Robert Mueller stacked with partisan Democrats , nor from being repeated ad nauseam by Democrats , their media allies , and anti-Trump pundits .\nIt is a silly allegation , no matter who feigns serious concerns about it . Trump did not encourage Russia to hack former secretary of state Clinton . In a palpably tongue-in-cheek effort to call public attention to his opponent \u2019 s biggest political vulnerability \u2014 viz. , her astounding use of a non-government , non-secure email system for her sensitive ( often classified ) State Department correspondence , and her purging of over 30,000 emails that she falsely claimed were wholly unrelated to government business \u2014 Trump quipped that he hoped Russia found the missing Clinton emails because they would titillate the media .\nObviously , Trump was not calling for Russia to hack Clinton \u2019 s emails . He couldn \u2019 t have been . As everyone knew , the FBI had Clinton \u2019 s decommissioned servers , offline and under lock and key . Indeed , the Bureau strongly suspected that Clinton \u2019 s emails had long ago been hacked by hostile foreign actors , potentially including Russian intelligence services . Trump was not sending a signal to his purported Russian confederates ; he was campaigning . He was hammering Clinton over her recklessness and dishonesty , major election issues . Furthermore , the \u201c collusion \u201d narrative held that Putin was the master and Trump the puppet ; even in that fantasyland , Trump did not give orders to Russian intelligence ; he took them .\nNevertheless , Democrats insist that the president ( a ) was pushing Russia to meddle ; ( b ) has now pushed Ukraine to meddle ; and ( c ) has more recently pushed China to meddle , also by investigating the Bidens . This last stems from still more presidential bloviating : When criticized for calling Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden , Trump ( being Trump ) doubled down by encouraging Beijing to do so , too . It was a noxious remark \u2014 suspects are tortured in the Communist Chinese \u201c justice \u201d system , so an American president should never even joke about Chinese investigation of an American . Still , Trump was talking nonsense . It warrants criticism , but to take it seriously is just as nonsensical . China does not take orders from Trump , and it plainly has no incentive to probe suspicions of corrupt ties between the Bidens and . . . itself .\nJust as frivolously , Democrats maintain that Trump \u2019 s \u201c abuse of power \u201d includes endangering American national security . Here is the theory : Our noble ( if pervasively corrupt ) ally Ukraine is in a border war with Russia , a hostile foreign power , so we supply defense aid to Kyiv so they can fight Moscow \u2019 s mercenaries over there , lest we have to fight the Russian army over here . Yes , Jerry Nadler would have us believe that Ukraine \u2014 its armed forces threaded with neo-Nazis and jihadists \u2014 is the only thing preventing Putin from laying waste to everything from the Upper West Side down to Greenwich Village .\nThis , from the same Democrats who yawned when Russia annexed Crimea , and when Obama denied Kyiv the lethal defense aid Trump has provided . This , from the same Democrats who swooned when Obama mocked Mitt Romney for observing that Russia remains our most worrisome geopolitical foe . This , from the same Democrats who cheered when Obama struck a deal , including cash ransom payments , to give Iran , the world \u2019 s leading state sponsor of anti-American terrorism , an industrial-strength nuclear program that , in the absence of meaningful monitoring , could be converted to a nuclear-arms program in nothing flat .\nIt is perfectly reasonable to contend that arming Ukraine against Russian aggression is in American interests \u2014 especially after prior U.S. administrations of both parties encouraged Ukraine to disarm on the loopy theory that post-Soviet Russia posed no threat . But the claim that Trump \u2019 s dealings with Ukraine have put our national security at risk is fatuous .\nThe second article of impeachment alleges that President Trump has obstructed Congress . That is , he has unilaterally decided what executive-branch information will be revealed to House investigators , directing relevant witnesses to withhold testimony and agencies to withhold documents .\nConsequently , an episode at Monday \u2019 s House hearing is worth pondering .\nDaniel Goldman , the Intelligence Committee \u2019 s top majority counsel and investigator , was being questioned by the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s ranking member , Doug Collins ( R. , Ga. ) . At issue was the majority \u2019 s decision , in composing its report , to issue telephone-records subpoenas and then publicize the resulting phone records of its political pi\u00f1atas \u2014 Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani , journalist John Solomon , and Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes \u2014 as if they were engaged in a nefarious conspiracy . The phone-records exposition did not advance the case that Trump pressured Zelensky to meddle in U.S. elections ; it was a smear job .\nCollins wanted to know , Who decided to do that ? Who made the call not only to issue the subpoena but to publicize the relevant names rather than refer to them anonymously , as would typically be done in intelligence reporting ( e.g. , Lawyer No . 1 , Journalist No . 1 , Congressman No . 1 ) ?\nGoldman \u2019 s response ? Essentially : None of your business . He refused to answer the questions . That is , the Democrats \u2019 chief legal beagle told an elected member of the People \u2019 s House that he ( the lawyer ) had unilaterally determined he need not provide information if he had what he regarded as a worthy reason to protect the confidentiality of communications .\nThe story is worth rehearsing so you understand : The Democrats \u2019 position is that the president of the United States does not have the same right to decline House requests for information \u2014 based on legally recognized executive privilege and attorney-client privilege \u2014 as an unelected bureaucrat who obeisantly answered every question posed by his fellow Democrats .\nMind you , I am a believer in political resolution of inter-branch disputes between the political parties . Unlike many conservatives and Trump supporters , I \u2019 m not particularly impressed that some Trump-administration officials have offered to litigate privilege issues in court . After all , in other cases , the Trump administration tells the court that it should stay out of political-branch squabbles . To be sure , I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s reasonable for the House to impeach under circumstances where the executive is willing to litigate privilege issues in court ; but I think it \u2019 s completely reasonable for the House to counter that the Constitution does not require the Article I branch to rely on the Article III branch to get compliance from the Article II branch . Theoretically , the House may tell the executive , \u201c If you don \u2019 t comply with our information demands , we \u2019 ll impeach you . \u201d\nI also think it \u2019 s fine for the president to tell Congress to take a walk if it demands evidence protected by executive privilege or other legal confidentiality claims . These inter-branch battles are meant to be resolved by politics , not judges . As a practical matter , disputes get worked out . It would be rash to go to DEFCON 1 when other arm-twisting can work ; in the end , House members who seek impeachment over thin gruel and presidents who contemptuously flout legitimate congressional inquiries know the voters will punish them if they push unreasonable positions too far .\nOn the politics , the president is banking on the public \u2019 s conclusion that the Democrats are engaged in a partisan crusade to impeach him , and he \u2019 s not going to cooperate . That leaves it to Democrats to convince the public that they are engaged in a good-faith inquiry into a matter of grave executive malfeasance , which the president is impeding .\nI don \u2019 t think we need a judge to figure this out . I do think it \u2019 s worth noting , though , that when Daniel Goldman told the committee he would not answer any questions that he did not wish to answer , no Democrat objected .\nIn impeachment , selective outrage is not a good look . I \u2019 m almost tempted to call it an abuse of power .",

But the claim that Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine have put our national security at risk is fatuous.\n\nOBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS\n\nThe second article of impeachment alleges that President Trump has obstructed Congress. That is, he has unilaterally decided what executive-branch information will be revealed to House investigators, directing relevant witnesses to withhold testimony and agencies to withhold documents.\n\nConsequently, an episode at Monday\u2019s House hearing is worth pondering.\n\nDaniel Goldman, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s top majority counsel and investigator, was being questioned by the Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking member, Doug Collins (R., Ga.). At issue was the majority\u2019s decision, in composing its report, to issue telephone-records subpoenas and then publicize the resulting phone records of its political pi\u00f1atas \u2014 Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, journalist John Solomon, and Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes \u2014 as if they were engaged in a nefarious conspiracy. The phone-records exposition did not advance the case that Trump pressured Zelensky to meddle in U.S. elections; it was a smear job.\n\nCollins wanted to know, Who decided to do that? Who made the call not only to issue the subpoena but to publicize the relevant names rather than refer to them anonymously, as would typically be done in intelligence reporting (e.g., Lawyer No. 1, Journalist No. 1, Congressman No. 1)?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldman\u2019s response? Essentially: None of your business. He refused to answer the questions. That is, the Democrats\u2019 chief legal beagle told an elected member of the People\u2019s House that he (the lawyer) had unilaterally determined he need not provide information if he had what he regarded as a worthy reason to protect the confidentiality of communications.\n\nThe story is worth rehearsing so you understand: The Democrats\u2019 position is that the president of the United States does not have the same right to decline House requests for information \u2014 based on legally recognized executive privilege and attorney-client privilege \u2014 as an unelected bureaucrat who obeisantly answered every question posed by his fellow Democrats.\n\nMind you, I am a believer in political resolution of inter-branch disputes between the political parties. Unlike many conservatives and Trump supporters, I\u2019m not particularly impressed that some Trump-administration officials have offered to litigate privilege issues in court. After all, in other cases, the Trump administration tells the court that it should stay out of political-branch squabbles. To be sure, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for the House to impeach under circumstances where the executive is willing to litigate privilege issues in court; but I think it\u2019s completely reasonable for the House to counter that the Constitution does not require the Article I branch to rely on the Article III branch to get compliance from the Article II branch. Theoretically, the House may tell the executive, \u201cIf you don\u2019t comply with our information demands, we\u2019ll impeach you.\u201d\n\nI also think it\u2019s fine for the president to tell Congress to take a walk if it demands evidence protected by executive privilege or other legal confidentiality claims. These inter-branch battles are meant to be resolved by politics, not judges. As a practical matter, disputes get worked out. It would be rash to go to DEFCON 1 when other arm-twisting can work; in the end, House members who seek impeachment over thin gruel and presidents who contemptuously flout legitimate congressional inquiries know the voters will punish them if they push unreasonable positions too far.\n\nOn the politics, the president is banking on the public\u2019s conclusion that the Democrats are engaged in a partisan crusade to impeach him, and he\u2019s not going to cooperate. That leaves it to Democrats to convince the public that they are engaged in a good-faith inquiry into a matter of grave executive malfeasance, which the president is impeding.\n\nI don\u2019t think we need a judge to figure this out. I do think it\u2019s worth noting, though, that when Daniel Goldman told the committee he would not answer any questions that he did not wish to answer, no Democrat objected.\n\nIn impeachment, selective outrage is not a good look. I\u2019m almost tempted to call it an abuse of power.",
