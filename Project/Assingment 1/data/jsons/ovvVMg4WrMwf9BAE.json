So why is it that none of those employees noticed that Russian operatives were using Facebook to manipulate the U.S. electoral process ? And why is it\u2014months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president , and after deadly protests in Charlottesville\u2014that those workers allowed organizations to buy ads on the platform targeting people who searched for phrases such as \u201c Jew haters \u201d ?\nThis ad-targeting mess has quickly become the Exxon Valdez of the Internet . Google , for its part , has 72,053 employees , many of whom are also working on smart algorithms to improve the company \u2019 s ad revenue , which accounts for 88 percent of its income . And yet , on Friday , BuzzFeed reported that Google allows groups to target ads toward people searching for racist phrases . So when people type in search queries like \u201c Jewish parasite , \u201d \u201c black people ruin everything , \u201d or \u201c the evil Jew , \u201d ads can potentially be served next to those keywords , and Google makes money off the transaction .

Earlier this year , a data researcher noticed that there were hundreds of Twitter accounts ending with a string of eight numbers ( like @ DavidJo52951945 ) that only tweeted about hot-button political topics , all of which followed each other . This might seem harmless on some level , but these accounts had been disseminating incredibly divisive ( and oftentimes fake ) stories about Brexit , Ukraine , and Syria , plus anti-immigration articles from outlets like Breitbart and excessively schismatic articles from the Daily Mail . The researcher also found that these accounts only tweeted between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Moscow time , and only during the week\u2014almost as if it were someone \u2019 s job in Russia to do so .
