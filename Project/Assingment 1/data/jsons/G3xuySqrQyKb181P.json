    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump 's criticism about the Muslim parents of a slain American soldier has generated -- once again -- a backlash within his own party .\nJust 100 days from the election , Trump has responded in his standard fashion -- dig in , claim he 's being treated unfairly and attack back .\nBut the swift condemnation of Trump 's response raises questions about whether this controversy is different from the ones that came before it .\nIt certainly is n't going away - Khizr and Ghazala Khan appeared for a lengthy joint interview on CNN 's `` New Day '' on Monday where Khizr accused Trump of `` ignorance and arrogance . ''\nKhan also said he 's received an outpouring of support for speaking out against the GOP presidential candidate , including from many Republicans . And he warned that Trump 's attacks on Muslims are boosting terror recruitment . Khan said it is good Muslims who are the ones who can help stop terror and make American safer .\n`` We are the solution to terrorism , '' Khan said on CNN Monday .\nTrump tweeted during the interview that the issue was not the Khans , it was stopping the spread of radical Islamic terrorism .\nThe White House also weighed in with an implicit rebuke of Trump , saying that Gold Star families deserve only `` honor and gratitude '' for their loved ones ' service .\nSpeaking aboard Air Force One , spokesman Eric Schultz would n't provide a specific response to Trump 's comments about the Khan family . But he said honoring Gold Star families should rise `` above politics . ''\n`` Families who make the ultimate sacrifice for this country 's freedom and this country 's safety deserve nothing but our country 's honor and gratitude and deepest respect , '' Schultz said .\nAlso on Monday , Hillary Clinton 's runningmate , Tim Kaine , said , `` Is it OK to speak in a disrespectful way about the military , about a Gold Star mom and dad for God 's sake , about people with disabilities , or saying offensive things about women , or trash people who are Latinos or immigrants more generally ? ''\n`` We 're either going to build a community that is a more perfect union , that is a community of respect or we 're going to decide to do what has been done throughout American history but never to our advantage , '' Kaine said during a campaign stop in Richmond , Virginia .\nThis time , attacks from the Republican presidential nominee on the parents of a soldier who died defending America have put new pressure on GOP leaders to decide whether they will continue to stand by him . Already , the party 's leaders in the House and the Senate have distanced themselves from Trump 's remarks , and other Republican figures are attacking their nominee forcefully .\nSen. John McCain issue a very personal statement Monday blasting Trump 's comments about the Khans and paying homage to their son Humayun 's sacrifice . McCain noted that his son also served in the Iraq War and the McCains have been serving in the US military for hundreds of years .\n`` It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party , '' McCain said . `` While our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination , it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us .\n`` Lastly , I 'd like to say to Mr. and Mrs. Khan : thank you for immigrating to America . We 're a better country because of you . And you are certainly right ; your son was the best of America , and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation -- and he will never be forgotten . ''\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said in a statement : `` This is going to a place where we 've never gone before , to push back against the families of the fallen . There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics -- that you do n't do -- like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you . ''\n`` If you 're going to be leader of the free world , you have to be able to accept criticism . Mr. Trump ca n't , '' Graham said . `` The problem is , 'unacceptable ' does n't even begin to describe it . ''\nJUST WATCHED Heated exchange about Donald Trump , Khizr Khan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Heated exchange about Donald Trump , Khizr Khan 01:40\nThe controversy is over Trump 's response to the Khans , whose son was killed in Iraq by a suicide bomber in 2004 . The Khans took the stage Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention , where Khizr Khan rejected Trump 's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States as unconstitutional , pulling a copy of the Constitution from his breast pocket and saying that Trump has `` sacrificed nothing and no one . '' Trump has since responded by criticizing Ghazala Khan 's silence and suggesting she was n't allowed to speak .\nThe incident recalls Trump 's attack last year on McCain . Trump said at the time that McCain is not a war hero because he was captured and imprisoned in Vietnam . Many had speculated the criticism would spark Trump 's decline in the GOP primary race -- it did not .\nBut there are two key differences : Trump was not yet the GOP nominee and McCain -- himself the 2008 GOP standard-bearer -- is a long-time public figure with experience parrying on the presidential level . The Khans are not .\n`` This is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country , '' Jeb Bush , a Trump rival in the 2016 GOP primary , said on Twitter Sunday evening .\nThis is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country . https : //t.co/TQcMuwXTKV \u2014 Jeb Bush ( @ JebBush ) July 31 , 2016\n`` There 's only one way to talk about Gold Star parents : with honor and respect , '' tweeted Ohio Gov .

He has NO redeeming qualities . \u2014 John Weaver ( @ JWGOP ) July 30 , 2016\nAnd both Republican congressional leaders took issue with Trump , issuing statements Sunday that praised the Khan family and reaffirmed their opposition Trump 's proposed Muslim travel ban .\n`` America 's greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it , '' House Speaker Ryan , R-Wisconsin , said . `` As I have said on numerous occasions , a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values . I reject it . Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military , and made the ultimate sacrifice . Captain Khan was one such brave example .

''\nBut both men noticeably did not mention Trump by name in their brief statements , that came hours after Khizr Khan called on them to repudiate Trump .\n`` It is a moral obligation -- history will not forgive them , '' Khan said of Ryan and McConnell on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` This election will pass , but history will be written . The lack of moral courage will remain a burden on their souls . ''\nHe told CNN 's Jim Acosta those GOP leaders have a `` moral , ethical obligation to not worry about the votes but repudiate him ; withdraw the support . If they do not , I will continue to speak . ''\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton also criticized Trump on Sunday , speaking to reporters alongside Kaine , a Virginia senator .\nAsked if Trump 's attack on the Khan family is a pivotal moment in the election , Clinton said : `` Well , he called Mexicans rapists and criminals . He said a federal judge was unqualified because of his Mexican heritage . He has called women pigs . He has mocked a reporter with a disability . ''\n`` That 's right , '' Clinton said . `` And any one of those things is so offensive and then to launch an attack as he did on Capt . Khan 's mother , a Gold Star mother , who stood there on that stage with her husband honoring the sacrifice of their son and who has in the days since spoken out about the overwhelming emotion that any mother would feel as her son was being honored and then to have Trump do what he did , I do n't know where the bounds are . I do n't know where the bottom is . ''\nLike the dust-up over Trump 's criticism of Indiana-born federal judge Gonzalo Curiel 's Mexican heritage , Trump 's reaction has been tinged with the stereotyping of Khan 's Muslim family .\nTrump suggested -- first in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd , then in an interview with ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos aired Sunday on `` This Week '' -- that Khan 's wife was n't allowed to speak .\nJUST WATCHED Khan wants McConnell and Ryan to fully reject Trump Replay More Videos ...

And it looked like she had nothing to say . A lot of people have said that . ''\nGhazala Khan , Khizr Khan 's wife , hit Trump back hard herself in an op-ed in The Washington Post Sunday , saying she declined to speak because she was emotionally distraught -- and suggested Trump lacks empathy if he fails to understand that decision .\n`` Donald Trump has children whom he loves . Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak ? '' she wrote .\nResponding to the backlash , Trump issued a statement Saturday praising Capt . Khan as a `` hero '' and saying the real problem is `` radical Islamic terrorists who killed him . ''\nBut in that statement , he again criticized the soldier 's father .\n`` While I feel deeply for the loss of his son , Mr. Khan who has never met me , has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution , ( which is false ) and say many other inaccurate things , '' Trump said in the statement .\n`` Captain Khan , killed 12 years ago , was a hero , but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our `` leaders '' to eradicate it !

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 31 , 2016\nAs Trump pushed back , first asking whether Ghazala Khan 's silence on stage was related to her faith , Khizr Khan again attacked Trump Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\n`` He is a black soul , and this is totally unfit for the leadership of this country , '' Khan said . `` The love and affection that we have received affirms that our grief -- that our experience in this country has been correct and positive . The world is receiving us like we have never seen . They have seen the blackness of his character , of his soul . ''\nOn Sunday night Trump 's running mate , Indiana Gov . Mike Pence , issued a statement offering praise for Humayan Khan as `` an American hero . '' Pence also touted the Trump campaign 's immigration plan , which would prevent newcomers from entering the US if they hail from countries `` that have been compromised by terrorism . ''\n`` Captain Khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror . Due to the disastrous decisions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , a once stable Middle East has now been overrun by ISIS . This must not stand , '' Pence said .\n`` By suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism , rebuilding our military , defeating ISIS at its source and projecting strength on the global stage , we will reduce the likelihood that other American families will face the enduring heartbreak of the Khan family . ''\nTrump 's advisers attempted to move past the controversy , downplaying the direct conflict between Trump and the Khan family .\n`` What he 's saying is that Mr. Trump has a right to defend himself , to make clear what he 's saying is this is about Islamic terrorism , for him to be criticized like that he did n't think was fair , '' Trump aide Jason Miller told CNN 's Brian Stelter on `` Reliable Sources '' Sunday .",
