Comey \u2019 s tenure had been marked by unprofessional behavior , and Trump was correct in recognizing that Comey had signed off on unfounded investigations unfairly targeting his campaign and White House . Why should a chief executive let a department of his own branch of government hobble his presidency and treat him like a criminal ?
