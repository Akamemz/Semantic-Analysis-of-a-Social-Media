The current constitution says he must leave office then . As he indicated on March 10th , he has no intention of doing so .\nRussians could be forgiven for feeling confused . On March 6th Mr Putin told them that he would not repeat the experience of the Soviet leaders who died in office . \u201c I like my job , but to retain the power I have , [ I would have ] to agree to some scheme that would be unacceptable for the country or ... destroy it. \u201d But four days later he did the opposite , telling the Duma ( parliament ) that he is willing to reset the clock on presidential term-limits and may stand again in 2024 . Two more six-year terms could thus keep Mr Putin\u2014if he stands and wins re-election\u2014in the presidency until 2036 , when he will be 83 .\nMr Putin has pondered and probably rejected various methods of retaining power : merging Russia with Belarus and so presiding over a new country ; presiding over an empowered supreme state council ; or becoming prime minister in a new parliamentary system . When confronted with a similar difficulty in 2008 , he simply swapped jobs with Dmitry Medvedev , then prime minister . This time , he appears to have chosen the crudest but perhaps most certain method\u2014changing the constitution and remaining president .\nHis statements have been as murky as the amendments to the constitution , which are confusing and contradict some other articles . He said at first that they would strengthen the powers of the parliament and the regions . In fact , the amendments grant the president near-absolute power , further reduce the authority of elected mayors and scrap the primacy of international norms over Russian laws . The power-grab is shrouded in the language of God , ancestral traditions , heterosexual families and sacred victory in the second world war ( the 75th anniversary of which Russia will mark on May 9th ) .\nYet , for such a momentous event , Mr Putin \u2019 s gambit performed before the Duma , lacked panache and drama . The show was contrived and stale . In a stylistic throw-back to deadly-dull Communist Party congresses , Valentina Tereshkova , an MP and former Soviet cosmonaut , said there was no point in trying to erect complicated political constructions . It would be much better to ask Vladimir Vladimirovich to stay as president for the good of the country .\nOn cue , the Duma applauded , and overwhelmingly voted for the amendments . Mr Putin is expected to sign them on March 18th , the sixth anniversary of the illegal annexation of Crimea . Taking the floor , Mr Putin laid out an extensive , self-serving definition of his role . \u201c The president is the guarantor of the constitution , \u201d he said , \u201c or , simply put , the guarantor of the country \u2019 s security , domestic stability and ... evolutionary development. \u201d Evolutionary , because \u201c we have had enough revolutions. \u201d He invoked foreign and domestic enemies : \u201c They are waiting for us to make a mistake or to slip up , losing our bearings or , worse still , get bogged down in internal dissent , which is sometimes fanned , fuelled and even financed from abroad . \u201d\nAlthough it would be quite wrong simply to remove term limits , he said casuistically , \u201c lifting restrictions against ... any citizen , including the current president , from taking part in an election in the future \u201d was quite a different matter .
