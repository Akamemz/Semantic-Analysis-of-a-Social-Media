Recent polls have shown her up by a few points , though the race still is very close \u2013 and the winner needs over 50 percent to avoid a runoff .\nAnother open question is Kentucky , where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes has endured a rough few weeks in her race against Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell .
