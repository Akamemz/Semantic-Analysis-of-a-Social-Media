When people need a test they can get a test . ''\nIn early March , the White House conceded that the United States did not have enough testing kits . Some health centres have also reported difficulties using them . The government says more than one million have now been distributed , with more on the way .\nBut the US has carried out far fewer tests than other countries - 26 per million people between 3 January and 11 March compared with South Korea 's 4,000 . The UK has carried out 400 tests per million and Italy 1,000 as of 10 March . Health experts fear the virus may have spread undetected in US communities because few tests were carried out .\n`` We made a life-saving move with early action on China . Now we must take the same action with Europe . ''\nPresident Trump has often cited travel restrictions as the reason the number of coronavirus cases is relatively low in the US and says many lives have been saved . On 31 January , any foreign national who had been to China within the previous 14 days was barred from entering the US . Three major US airlines operating flights to China had already stopped flying .\nLater in February , restrictions were placed on foreign nationals who had been in Iran - which was already under a travel ban - in the previous 14 days .

Personally , I think the number is way under 1 % . ''\nIn a telephone interview on Fox News , President Trump said a WHO figure of 3.4 % for the coronavirus death rate was `` false '' . WHO reported this figure on 3 March and said it was based on all the confirmed coronavirus cases that had resulted in death .\nMr Trump said he thought the true death rate , based on `` my hunch '' , was `` way under 1 % '' . He said the death rate appeared higher because many people who caught a mild form of the virus did not report it to the doctor and therefore did not end up as confirmed cases .\nAt the moment we do n't know how likely you are to die from coronavirus , mainly because of the lack of data on infections . However , scientists ' current best guess is about 1 % .\nOn 9 March : `` Last year 37,000 Americans died from the common flu . Nothing is shut down , life and the economy go on ... Think about that . ''\nThis statement from the president requires context . We do n't know exactly how many Americans ' deaths there have been linked to flu .

So a lot of people die from flu each year , as Mr Trump points out .\nHowever , unlike most strains of flu , the spread of new coronavirus has not yet been contained by vaccines or immunity from previous outbreaks , and scientists ( including those from the WHO ) believe it has a significantly higher death rate than that of seasonal flu ( which , on average , is about 0.1 % ) .\nOn 7 March : `` Very soon , we 're going to come up [ with a vaccine ] .
