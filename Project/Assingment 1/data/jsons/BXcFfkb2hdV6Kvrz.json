Rand Paul .\nMr. Paul , a strong gun rights advocate who formally announced his bid for the presidency this week , has not received any formal endorsements or money from the nation \u2019 s largest and most politically potent gun lobby despite his \u201c A \u201d voting record rating from the NRA .\n\u201c We did not extend an invitation to Sen. Rand Paul , and he didn \u2019 t request to be invited , \u201d said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker , blaming the packed lineup and scheduling restraints for Mr. Paul \u2019 s absence . Mr. Paul and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie are two of the only top-tier GOP 2016 hopefuls not speaking at the NRA function .\nInsiders , however , say it \u2019 s because of Mr. Paul \u2019 s association with the National Association for Gun Rights ( NAGR ) , a rival pro-gun rights umbrella group , that has angered other gun rights advocates , who accuse the group of misleading mailings and headline-stealing tactics .\nNAGR was founded by Mike Rothfeld , a direct mail prodigy and owner of Virginia-based Saber Communications , to which Mr. Paul and his political action committees paid $ 2.6 million for services during the 2014 election cycle . The Kentucky senator \u2019 s father , Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , paid Saber about $ 7.7 million for work it did for his 2012 presidential campaign , according to Federal Election Commission filings .\nSaber also handles the direct mail of NAGR and such other conservative groups as National Right to Work and National Pro-Life Alliance , maintaining all of their contact lists .\nMore recently , the younger Mr. Paul \u2019 s Reinventing a New Direction ( RAND ) political action committee paid Saber $ 7,400 last Dec. 23 to rent its mailing lists and contact names , according to FEC filings . Last election cycle , RAND PAC spent $ 216,452 to maintain access to Saber \u2019 s database .\n\u201c I am a professional junk mailer , \u201d Mr. Rothfeld said at a lecture entitled \u201c The Real Nature of Politics , \u201d which was posted on YouTube two years ago . \u201c I am a professional telemarketer . I \u2019 m a professional spammer \u2014 like , a hundred million pieces of emails a month . And I \u2019 m a professional negative campaigner . And I \u2019 m damn proud of all four . \u201d\nMr. Rothfeld declined to discuss his business with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but NAGR officials portray the group as more conservative and effective than the NRA , which it claims is too connected to the official power structure in Washington .\nAll of Mr. Rothfeld \u2019 s mailings cast a wide net , reaching as many conservatives as possible , and critics say the company then aims to draw the recipient into the campaign by frightening them on issues or legislation that establishment figures don \u2019 t entertain as threats .\nNAGR has branded itself as the conservative alternative to the NRA , one not beholden to Washington insiders . But some Second Amendment advocates think the group \u2019 s main claim to fame is stoking the fears of the less-informed for-profit .\nLast month , the group \u2019 s affiliate in Mississippi , as labeled on NAGR \u2019 s website , sent a letter to pro-gun advocates urging them to donate money so they could help fight a state bill to mark ammunition . The only problem was there was no bill .\n\u201c Just recently , the Mississippi Registration Ammo Bill ( S.B . 2030 ) was introduced , \u201d wrote Mississippi Gun Rights in a letter dated March 16 and obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to GUT our gun rights here in Mississippi ! \u201d\nThe bill NAGR \u2019 s letter was referring to \u2014 S.B . 2030 \u2014 was actually legislation dealing with the education reform program Common Core , and the ammunition bill the group was referencing ( S.B . 2219 ) had died in committee a month before the mailing was sent .\n\u201c Sometimes there \u2019 s a legitimate need to sound the alarm bells when there \u2019 s actual danger on the horizon , \u201d said George Whitten Jr. , who received the letter from the group . \u201c But this was just deceiving \u2014 making up a danger and deceiving people on their mailing list so they would send more money to help defeat a bill that was already dead . \u201d\nNAGR , run by Executive Vice President Dudley Brown with Mr. Rothfeld being named a director-at-large , was established in 2000 and claims to be the \u201c fastest growing gun-rights group in America \u201d on its website , serving as an umbrella group for a number of state-based gun rights groups .\nThe NAGR rose to fame when it outspent the NRA in terms of lobbying . However , the majority of its budget is spent on promotional materials .\nAccording to the group \u2019 s most recent financial disclosures , in 2013 it raised $ 16.4 million . It spent $ 1.47 million on lobbying , but then paid out $ 5.97 million in direct mail ; $ 3.21 million in Internet promotion ; $ 334,694 in tour promotion ; and $ 344,629 in telemarketing expenses , altogether constituting 60 percent of its budget \u2014 its single largest expense .\n\u201c In the year the NRA claimed to be the biggest watershed moment in gun control , 2013 , federal records showed we spent twice as much as they did lobbying , \u201d said Mr. Brown in an interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c They kept their spending the same , but we went way over and above . \u201d\nMr. Brown said most of his mailers call for people to sign a petition or phone their representatives to protest a bill , but also include a way to donate to the organization if they wish , which drives up what they have to report in promotional spending .\nAs for the ammunition bill in Mississippi , he blamed it on a printing error .\nHe said his group was more aggressive and effective than the much larger NRA .\n\u201c We \u2019 re younger , we \u2019 re hungrier , and we care less about the cocktail parties in Washington , D.C. , \u201d Mr. Brown recently told The Wall Street Journal .\nMr. Paul \u2019 s image is used on NAGR \u2019 s fundraising materials , and the group consistently sends out both emails and letters credited to Mr. Paul on gun rights issues . Before the 2014 midterms the senator hosted a telemarketing call with about 6,000 NAGR supporters requesting $ 100 donations to help win political races , and in January he appeared at a NAGR-sponsored event in New Hampshire .\n\u201c Senator Paul is happy to work with pro-2nd Amendment groups and will always make the issue a top priority , \u201d said Doug Stafford , the executive director of RAND PAC in an emailed statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Senator Paul signs letters for many groups promoting issues he believes in . He does not have any role in the strategy of those groups . \u201d\nMr. Stafford was asked if Mr. Paul was willing to distance himself from NAGR because of its reputation among other Second Amendment groups and he didn \u2019 t provide any substantive response .\nRegarding the absence from the NRA conference slight , Mr. Stafford wrote : \u201c Sen . Paul is a champion of the Second Amendment and the strongest voice for freedom in the U.S. Senate . He has an unblemished record of support for gun rights . He is on the road announcing his run for president all week . \u201d\nAnd , as political experts know , running for president is expensive and fundraising crucial .\n\u201c Political campaigns are all startup companies ; they \u2019 ve got to build a base from the ground up , \u201d said Bruce Newman , a marketing professor at DePaul University and author of \u201c The Marketing of the President . \u201d\nThe aggregating of voter data through the multiple mailing lists of different organizations allows candidates to customize their message and microtarget certain people who have historically shown a propensity to get involved in issues they care about , either in an online setting or by going door-to-door \u2014 information that is extremely valuable to first-time presidential candidates for both turnout and fundraising , Mr. Newman said .\n\u201c The aggregating of big data from multiple lists is extremely important in that it allows you to raise hundreds of millions of dollars by knowing who your audience is , how active in campaigns they \u2019 ve been , what they like to watch visually , words they respond to , what they like and how to inspire them , \u201d said Mr. Newman , noting President Obama \u2019 s election campaigns were the masters of big data and the aggregation of lists .\nSo far , Mr. Paul has been successful at motivating this grass-roots base , raising $ 1.2 million since announcing his presidency on Tuesday .\nStill , some in the gun rights community don \u2019 t care for Mr. Paul extending his name and reputation to an organization like NAGR , which has been known to attack other Republicans and Second Amendment activists on grounds they consider specious .\n\u201c Lots of people have complained to Rand that [ NAGR officials ] are raising money and doing nothing with it but attacking other Republicans and Second Amendment groups for not being \u2018 pure enough , \u2019 \u201d said Alan Gottlieb , the founder of the Second Amendment Foundation , which filed and won a landmark suit overturning Chicago \u2019 s handgun ban and made it clear that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applied to states and localities .\nLast year , the NAGR attacked Mr. Gottlieb for supporting a national gun registry .\nMr. Gottlieb said he never advocated for such a position .
