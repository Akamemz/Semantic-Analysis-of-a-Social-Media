    "content": "The Republican National Committee is expected to debate a proposal next week that would dramatically shift the balance of power at this summer \u2019 s convention \u2014 and impose a new rulebook for selecting the party 's nominee .\nThe proposal , which will top the agenda during a meeting of the Rules panel at the RNC \u2019 s annual spring meeting in Hollywood Beach , Fla. , would fundamentally alter how the convention is conducted , further empowering the delegates to determine the course of the proceedings .\nIt amounts to not just a changing of the rules but of the rulebook itself , with far-reaching implications , potentially impacting whether party insiders will be able to draft a so-called \u201c white knight \u201d \u2014 someone currently not running who would play the role of savior at a deadlocked convention .\nThe proposal is the brainchild of Solomon Yue , an RNC officer and Rules Committee member from Oregon . It would replace the system used at Republican national conventions for decades , which mimic those used by the U.S. House of Representatives , with Robert \u2019 s Rules of Order , a design that \u2019 s often used to oversee civic and organizational meetings .\nSome see the idea as a recipe for utter chaos , and one that could open the door to mischief-making . With thousands of delegates on hand , it \u2019 s easy to imagine a scenario where objections pile up , jamming up floor proceedings and turning the convention into a train wreck \u2014 all before the eyes of a national audience .\nRNC officials say Yue 's plan is almost certain to be tabled until closer to the convention . But it will spark a months-long debate just as the scrutiny into the party \u2019 s internal workings is intensifying .\nIn recent days , Donald Trump has launched an intense PR campaign accusing the RNC of stacking the deck against him in a series of delegate contests that he \u2019 s decried as \u201c rigged .
