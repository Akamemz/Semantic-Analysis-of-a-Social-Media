    "content": "\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power . Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they \u2019 re published .\nThe links to the viral video \u201c Plandemic \u201d started showing up in my Facebook feed Wednesday . \u201c Very interesting , \u201d one of my friends wrote about it . I saw several subsequent posts about it , and then my brother texted me , \u201c Got a sec ? \u201d\nMy brother is a pastor in Colorado and had someone he respects urge him to watch \u201c Plandemic , \u201d a 26-minute video that promises to reveal the \u201c hidden agenda \u201d behind the COVID-19 pandemic . I called him and he shared his concern : People seem to be taking the conspiracy theories presented in \u201c Plandemic \u201d seriously . He wondered if I could write something up that he could pass along to them , to help people distinguish between sound reporting and conspiracy thinking or propaganda .\nSo I watched \u201c Plandemic. \u201d I did not find it credible , as I will explain below . YouTube , Facebook and Vimeo have since removed it from their platforms for violating their guidelines . Now it \u2019 s available on its own site .\nSensational videos , memes , rants and more about COVID-19 are likely to keep coming . With society polarized and deep distrust of the media , the government and other institutions , such content is a way for bad actors to sow discord , mostly via social media . We saw it with Russia in the 2016 election and we should expect it to continue .\nBut what surprised me is how easily \u201c Plandemic \u201d sank its hooks into some of my friends . My brother also felt alarmed that his own church members and leaders in other churches might be tempted to buy into it .\nThe purpose of this column is not to skewer \u201c Plandemic. \u201d My goal is to offer some criteria for sifting through all the content we see every day , so we can tell the difference between fair reporting and something so biased it should not be taken seriously .\nHere \u2019 s a checklist , some of which I shared with my friends on Facebook , to help interrogate any content \u2014 and that includes what we publish at \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThere \u2019 s never just one side to a story . I mentioned this point in 2018 when I wrote about my faith and the biblical basis for investigative reporting . One of my favorite Proverbs says , \u201c The first to state his case seems right until another comes and cross-examines him. \u201d So a fair presentation should at least acknowledge opposing points of view .\nI didn \u2019 t see this in \u201c Plandemic , \u201d so I called the filmmaker , Mikki Willis , who is also the film \u2019 s narrator , to ask him whether I had somehow missed the other side of the argument . I had not . \u201c The other side of the argument plays 24/7 on every screen in every airport and on every phone and in every home , \u201d Willis said . \u201c The people are only seeing one side of the story all the time . This is the other side of the story . This is not a piece that \u2019 s intended to be perfectly balanced . \u201d\nI asked Willis if it was fair to call his film \u201c propaganda , \u201d which the Oxford dictionary defines as \u201c information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view . \u201d\nHe said he doesn \u2019 t feel there \u2019 s anything misleading in his film , but otherwise the definition fits . And based on that definition he feels 100 % of news reporting is propaganda . \u201c What isn \u2019 t propaganda these days ? \u201d he asked . \u201c In that sense , what we \u2019 re doing is fighting fire with fire . \u201d\nThe star of \u201c Plandemic , \u201d medical researcher Judy Mikovits , is controversial . The magazine Science reports that it published and then retracted one of her papers in 2011 . A search warrant provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by one of her former attorneys shows she was fired from her position at Whittemore Peterson Institute , a research center in Nevada , in September 2011 . Then she allegedly stole notebooks and a laptop computer from the Institute , the search warrant said , leading to an arrest warrant for alleged possession of stolen property and unlawful taking of computer data . She was arrested on Nov. 18 , 2011 , but denied wrongdoing . The charges were dropped .\nBut \u201c Plandemic \u201d ignores or brushes past these facts and portrays her as an embattled whistleblower . \u201c So you made a discovery that conflicted with the agreed-upon narrative ? \u201d Willis says to Mikovits , introducing her as a victim . \u201c And for that , they did everything in their powers to destroy your life . \u201d\nA typical viewer is not going to know the details about Mikovits \u2019 background . But as the primary source of controversial information being presented as fact , it \u2019 s worth an online search . The fact-checking site PolitiFact details her arrest and criminal charges . Clearly , there \u2019 s more to her story than what \u2019 s presented in \u201c Plandemic. \u201d That should give us pause when we assess its credibility .\nIn \u201c Plandemic , \u201d Willis asks Mikovits about her arrest : \u201c What did they charge you with ? \u201d\n\u201c Nothing , \u201d she replies . \u201c I was held in jail , with no charges . \u201d\nBeing charged with a crime is one of those concrete facts that we can check out . Science magazine reported Mikovits \u2019 arrest and felony charge . I also found a civil lawsuit she filed against the Whittemore Peterson Institute in 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California . \u201c Mikovits was arrested on criminal charges\u2026 \u201d her complaint says in the case , which was eventually dismissed .\nI asked Willis about the apparent discrepancy , where she said in his film that she wasn \u2019 t charged , when court documents show that she was charged . After my inquiry , he said he spoke to Mikovits and now feels it is clear that she meant that the charges were dropped .\nI tracked down Mikovits and she said what she meant in the film is that there were no charges of any type of wrongdoing that would have led to her being charged with being a fugitive from justice . She admitted that all the controversy has been hard for her to sort out . \u201c I \u2019 ve been confused for a decade , \u201d she told me . She said she would try to be more clear in the future when she talks about the criminal charge : \u201c I \u2019 ll try to learn to say it differently , \u201d she said .\nThis underscores the importance of careful verification , and it distinguishes the craft of journalism from other forms of information sharing . People often speak imprecisely when they \u2019 re telling their stories . It \u2019 s our duty to nail down precisely what they do and do not mean , and verify it independently . If we don \u2019 t , we risk undermining their credibility and ours . That \u2019 s in part why we at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and many other journalists often link directly to our underlying source documents , so you can verify the information yourself .\nDr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , is one of the nation \u2019 s leaders in the response to the coronavirus . In \u201c Plandemic , \u201d Mikovits accuses Fauci of a cover-up and of paying off people who perpetrate fraud , among other things . PolitiFact found no evidence to support the allegations against Fauci .\nEvery time I write a story that accuses someone of wrongdoing I call them and urge them to explain the situation from their perspective . This is standard in mainstream journalism . Sometimes I \u2019 ve gone to extreme lengths to get comments from someone who will be portrayed unfavorably in my story \u2014 traveling to another state and showing up at their office and their home and leaving a note if they are not there to meet me . \u201c Plandemic \u201d doesn \u2019 t indicate whether the filmmakers reached out to Fauci for his version of the story . So I asked Willis about it . \u201c We did not , \u201d he told me .\nAre All Sources Named and Cited , and if Not , Is the Reason Explained ?\nAll sources should be identified , with their credentials , so viewers can verify their expertise or possible biases . If they can \u2019 t be for some reason , then that should be explained . \u201c Plandemic \u201d features unnamed people in medical scrubs , presented as doctors , saying they \u2019 re being wrongly pressured to add COVID-19 on people \u2019 s death certificates or are not being allowed to use the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat patients . But the speakers are not named , so we can \u2019 t really tell who they are , or even if they are doctors at all . That makes it impossible to tell if they are credible .\nI asked Willis why he didn \u2019 t name those people . He told me he was in a hurry to release the 26-minute version of \u201c Plandemic , \u201d but the doctors will be named in the final version . \u201c We should have done that , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Plandemic \u201d calls itself a documentary that reveals \u201c the hidden agenda behind COVID-19. \u201d We are in the midst of a global pandemic where few people in the world can figure out what is happening or the right way to respond , let alone agendas . We have almost every journalist in the country writing about this . And if the truth about a conspiracy is out there , many people have an incentive to share it . But \u201c Plandemic \u201d would like us to think it \u2019 s presenting some exclusive bit of secret knowledge that is going to get at the real story . That \u2019 s not likely .\nPlus , to be honest , there were so many conspiratorial details stacked on top of each other in the film I couldn \u2019 t keep them straight . When I spoke to Willis I told him I was having a hard time understanding his point . Then I took a stab at what I thought was the main thrust of his argument . \u201c Are you saying that powerful people planned the pandemic and made it happen so they could get rich by making everyone get vaccines ? \u201d I asked .\nIt turns out Willis isn \u2019 t sure either . \u201c We \u2019 re in the exploratory phase , \u201d he told me . \u201c I don \u2019 t know , to be clear , if it \u2019 s an intentional or naturally occurring situation . I have no idea . \u201d\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nThen he went on to say that the pandemic is being politicized and used to take away our civil liberties and leverage other political policies . \u201c Certain forces \u201d have latched onto the situation , he said . \u201c It \u2019 s too fishy . \u201d\nHe had me at , \u201c I have no idea. \u201d That sums it up . This is a vast pandemic and massive catastrophe . Our country wasn \u2019 t prepared for it , and the response by our top leaders has been disjointed . We \u2019 re restricted to our homes . Many people have lost their jobs and some are afraid or sick or dying . That makes us vulnerable to exploitation by people who will present inaccurate or intellectually dishonest information that promises to tell us the truth .\nPerhaps \u201c Plandemic \u201d is guilty of sloppy storytelling , or maybe people really do believe the things they \u2019 re saying in the video . Or perhaps they \u2019 re being intentionally dishonest , or it \u2019 s a biased connecting of the dots rooted in personal and professional grievances . I don \u2019 t know because I can \u2019 t get inside their heads to judge their motives .\nUltimately , we \u2019 re all going to need to be more savvy consumers when it comes to information , no matter how slickly it \u2019 s presented . This may be but a signal of what \u2019 s to come in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election , when memes and ads of unknown origin come across our social media feeds . There are standards for judging the credibility of the media we take in every day , so let \u2019 s apply them .\nTell Us More About Coronavirus Are you a public health worker , medical provider , elected official , patient or other COVID-19 expert ?
