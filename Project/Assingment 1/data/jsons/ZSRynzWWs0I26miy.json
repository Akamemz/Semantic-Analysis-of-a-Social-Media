That tells you everything you need to know about McCain . \u201d\nReally ? You think everything you need to know about a man \u2019 s 81 years on this earth can be nullified or reaffirmed by your approval of his guest list at his funeral ? Twenty-three years of military service , 23 bombing missions , a Silver Star , a Bronze Star , a Purple Heart , a Distinguished Flying Cross , five and a half years as a prisoner of war , solitary confinement for two years , two to three beatings a week , repatriation refused , two terms in the U.S. House , six terms in the Senate , nearly 800 pieces of legislation introduced , thousands of votes , six books , hundreds of speeches , two presidential campaigns , two spouses , seven children . . . and you think \u201c everything you need to know about McCain \u201d is whether he shares your view of the president ?\nHaving said that , there is an aspect of the current McCain coverage that is sticking in my craw . At some point , John McCain will pass away into the arms of his Creator , and he will receive a lot of well-earned praise and fond farewells , particularly from political figures and those who covered him for the past three decades or so .\nI wouldn \u2019 t mind if those political figures and those who covered McCain took a moment to evaluate if they were fair to the man , particularly in the year 2008 . Because maybe no national figure in the modern era flipped so quickly from the hero to the villain column in his media coverage and back , depending upon whether the majority of the mainstream media agreed with his stances or not .\nBack in the late 1990s , the national media loved him for McCain-Feingold campaign-finance reform , which would have made it more difficult for ordinary citizens to use their money to support their preferred candidates and made the exempted media coverage even more influential . In the 2000 Republican presidential primary , most of the media quickly decided they preferred him to George W. Bush . In 2000 , The New Republic endorsed McCain in the Republican primaries , declaring , \u201c for the first time in recent memory , a serious Republican presidential candidate is seeking to remake his party into something other than the political arm of the privileged few . \u201d\nAfter 9/11 , McCain emerged as a strong supporter of the War on Terror and war in Iraq , and in most of the media \u2019 s eyes , McCain became just another terrible crazed Republican warmonger again . Michael Moore made the \u201c loser \u201d sign at McCain during his speech at the 2004 Republican convention . By 2006 , Ezra Klein was criticizing McCain \u2019 s status as \u201c every liberal \u2019 s favorite conservative , \u201d spotlighting his \u201c wingnut bonafides. \u201d The coverage of McCain in the Bush years was predictable ; when McCain touted comprehensive immigration reform , he was a hero ; when he supported the surge , he was \u201c embracing an unpopular strategy that will make an already unpopular war longer and bloodier. \u201d ( As we all know , the surge worked , and violence and casualties in Iraq dropped . )\nBy 2008 , the same New Republic magazine that had once endorsed him suddenly remembered the Keating Five scandal from 1989 and suggested he should have been expelled from the Senate for it . Suddenly there was a surge of profiles focusing on \u201c the dark side of John McCain. \u201d The media suddenly began to focus on his family \u2019 s wealth , which hadn \u2019 t been much of an issue before . The value of military service as preparation for the presidency , such a strong argument in 2000 , suddenly disappeared once the race became John McCain vs. Barack Obama .\nIn a campaign ad , the Obama campaign mocked McCain \u2019 s age and inability to use a computer . ( Eventually , even Joe Biden called the ad \u201c terrible. \u201d ) Yet media coverage lamented that John McCain had somehow \u201c sold his soul \u201d to win the Republican nomination .\nMcCain remained mostly in villain status through Obama \u2019 s presidency , although sometimes he could still get good coverage when contrasted with another , usually more conservative Republican . But Michael Tomasky summarized the national media \u2019 s view well : \u201c He used to be a great senator . But all that was very , very long ago . Since 2008 , when he caved in to the advisers who pushed Sarah Palin on him as his vice-presidential pick , he \u2019 s been a different guy . \u201d\nAnd then in 2017 , McCain opposed the GOP legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare , and then he was touted as a heroic \u201c maverick \u201d again .

But there \u2019 s little doubt that when McCain took a position , he did it because he was convinced it was the right thing to do .
