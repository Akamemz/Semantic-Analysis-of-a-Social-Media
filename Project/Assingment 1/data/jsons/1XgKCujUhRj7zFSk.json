But Paulson , commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , said that Zehaf-Bibeau -- a recent Muslim convert whose father was from Libya -- may have lashed out in frustration over delays in obtaining a passport .\n`` I think the passport figured prominently in his motives . I 'm not inside his head , but I think it was central to what was driving him , '' Paulson said , adding that authorities learned from his mother , Susan Bibeau , after the attack about his desire to travel to Syria .\n`` His application was not rejected .
