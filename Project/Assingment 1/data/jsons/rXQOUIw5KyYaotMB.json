    "content": "President Obama and other world leaders on Thursday hailed what they said was a breakthrough accord setting the stage for a historic agreement that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon , even though Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium under the agreement and the schedule for easing international sanctions remains to be negotiated .\nAfter 12 years of deadlock over Iran \u2019 s disputed nuclear activities \u2014 and a sleepless marathon of negotiations in Switzerland over the past week \u2014 Iranian and Western diplomats said the final terms of a 15-year phased deal will be hammered out and signed by all sides this summer .\nAn ebullient Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iran \u2019 s top negotiator , hailed the agreement reached in Lausanne as a \u201c win-win \u201d for both sides .\nIn Washington , Mr. Obama said that \u201c if this framework leads to a comprehensive deal , it will make our country , our allies and our world safer . \u201d\nEven as critics on Capitol Hill and Israel pointed out shortcomings and omissions in the deal , Mr. Obama told reporters in the White House Rose Garden that Iran agreed to dramatically limit the scope of its nuclear program and committed to \u201c the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history . \u201d\n\u201c It is a good deal , a deal that meets our core objectives , \u201d the president said .\nIf it leads to a final deal , he said , the framework negotiated by top diplomats from the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , Russia , China and Iran will \u201c cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nSkeptics were out in force by Thursday night , and a fact sheet that the State Department circulated to reporters showed a clear gap between the president \u2019 s rhetoric and the terms of the agreement by Washington and its allies .\nIn a concession indicating that Western negotiators believe the Islamic republic ultimately will build a nuclear bomb , the fact sheet suggested that the agreement \u2019 s bottom line is simply to slow the speed at which Iranian scientists can pursue such a goal if they violate terms of the agreement .\nThe amount of time it would take Iran to \u201c break out \u201d with enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon is \u201c currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months , \u201d the State Department document said . If the deal is finalized , \u201c that timeline will be extended to at least one year , for the duration of at least ten years . \u201d\nAll sides agree that the nuclear agreement will not resolve a host of bilateral problems that have poisoned U.S.-Iranian relations for decades , including Iran \u2019 s support for insurgent proxies in Iraq and throughout the Middle East , its suspected support of terrorist groups and even Tehran \u2019 s refusal to release three Americans \u2014 a Christian pastor , a journalist and a former U.S. Marine \u2014 who are being held in Iranian prisons .\nOn a separate front , uncertainty loomed over the process by which Iran will achieve its top objective in the talks : an end to crushing international economic sanctions , including the global embargo on Iranian crude oil , that the Obama administration helped organize in recent years to force Tehran to the bargaining table .\nThe State Department fact sheet said only that sanctions relief will occur if and when Iran \u201c verifiably abides by its commitments \u201d under a final deal . No specific timeline was identified , leaving open the possibility that sanctions could be lifted rapidly or could continue for years after a final deal is signed .\nThe sanctions issue is believed to have been bitterly divisive as the nuclear talks continued past the negotiators \u2019 self-imposed March 31 deadline and one that may cause Mr. Obama significant problems with Congress .\nIran \u2019 s Mr. Zarif at first acknowledged to reporters that sanctions would be lifted only after inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have verified Iranian compliance with the terms of a final deal .\nBut Thursday night , Mr. Zarif took to Twitter to assert : \u201c There is no need to spin using \u2018 fact sheets \u2019 so early on. \u201d The main point , he said moments later , is that the sanctions will be lifted .\nThe White House said late Thursday that Mr. Obama personally briefed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Saudi officials \u2014 who are deeply skeptical of any agreement with Tehran \u2014 on the details of the accord .\nMr. Netanyahu , who addressed a joint session of Congress last month lobbying against a deal with Iran , was not assuaged .\n\u201c A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel , \u201d Mr. Netanyahu declared in a statement after the president \u2019 s call .\nIn an ironic twist , the lack of clarity on sanctions could help Mr. Obama sell the deal in Washington , where Republicans and some key Democrats in Congress have been threatening to do everything in their power to keep the sanctions in place .\nThe unexpected extent and specificity of the deal , after multiple reports that negotiators in Lausanne were at loggerheads , appeared to give some critics pause as they tried to digest the details .\n\u201c If a final agreement is reached , the American people , through their elected representatives , must have the opportunity to weigh in , \u201d said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker , Tennessee Republican , who is pushing a bill to require congressional review of any final deal before Mr. Obama can lift sanctions .\n\u201c Iranian leaders will now find a nuclear weapon dangerously within reach , \u201d said Rep. Michael T. McCaul , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security . \u201c If this deal moves forward , the consequences for the U.S. and our allies in the region will be dire . \u201d\nRep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , was more generous . \u201c While important details still need to be worked out , \u201d he said , the framework accord shows \u201c a negotiated resolution of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program may be possible .\n\u201c Congress must ensure that its actions do not preclude reaching an acceptable agreement or be seen as scuttling a peaceful path to ending Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions , \u201d Mr. Schiff said .\nThe agreement was first announced by European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Mr. Zarif , who appeared together at the site of negotiations in Switzerland .\nWith diplomats from the so-called P5+1 group \u2014 the U.N. Security Council \u2019 s five permanent members , plus Germany \u2014 behind them , the two read out a joint statement hailing what they called a \u201c decisive step \u201d after more than a decade of negotiations .\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry , the lead U.S. negotiator , acknowledged that the deal remains preliminary but stressed that \u201c the parameters that we have agreed to will do exactly what we set out to do : make certain that all pathways to make enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon have been cut off . \u201d\nExplaining the deal , U.S. officials said Tehran has agreed to reduce the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges it operates by roughly two-thirds , from an estimated 19,000 to roughly 5,000 . The remaining centrifuges will be allowed to continue with only low-level enrichment good for civilian nuclear power use over the coming 10 years .\nU.S. officials also said Tehran agreed to trim its uranium enrichment to a level of 3.67 percent for at least 15 years and committed to reducing its stockpile of about 10,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms for 15 years .\nIran also has agreed to halt all uranium enrichment at its heavily fortified underground Fordow nuclear facility , although the facility will be allowed to remain as a nuclear , physics and technology research center , the officials said . Critics noted that even Mr. Obama has questioned why Iran needed the secretive Fordow facility if it was not interested in obtaining a bomb .\nAccording to the State Department fact sheet , Iran \u2019 s enrichment activities will be confined to the Natanz facility roughly 200 miles south of Tehran , where enrichment activities also will be curtailed .\nThe document said Iran has agreed to enrich uranium using only its first-generation IR-1 model centrifuges at Natanz for 10 years \u2014 removing roughly 1,000 advanced IR-2 model centrifuges from the facility and placing them in \u201c IAEA monitored storage for ten years . \u201d\nAt the same time , Tehran will allow IAEA inspectors \u201c regular access to all of Iran \u2019 s nuclear facilities , including to Iran \u2019 s enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow , \u201d the department said .\nIran appears not to have agreed to surprise inspections , a provision that many critics demanded .\nA combative Mr. Obama strongly defended the accord and challenged his congressional critics to offer a better alternative if they were prepared to scuttle the deal on offer .\n\u201c If Congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis , and without offering any reasonable alternative , then it \u2019 s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c International unity will collapse , and the path to conflict will widen . \u201d",
