Many of their arguments are wildly off base , but there is also good evidence that the union urgently needs reform .\nThe complaints against the E.U . are somewhat different in each of its 28 member nations , but they reflect similar frustrations . Many Britons voted to leave the union because they wanted to restrict immigration from other European countries and to get rid of E.U . regulations . The Five Star Movement in Italy wants the country to leave the euro currency and return to the lira to revive a weak economy . And the French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen said in March that the E.U . was \u201c the death of our economy , our social welfare system and our identity . \u201d\nMs . Le Pen and her ilk have found a receptive audience for their nativist and isolationist views because many people have lost faith that the E.U . and its officials can deliver the stability and prosperity that was the purpose of the European project . In recent years , the failure to find a unified response to the flow of refugees from Syria , Africa and elsewhere has further damaged the E.U. \u2019 s reputation . Whether or not Britain ultimately leaves the union , it is now up to leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany , President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy to reform the E.U . or watch its credibility and effectiveness drain away further .\nOne of the most basic critiques of the union is that it is not democratic . This is an exaggeration , but it includes a kernel of truth . Of the E.U. \u2019 s three main institutions , the most powerful is the European Council , which is made up of 28 national governments .
