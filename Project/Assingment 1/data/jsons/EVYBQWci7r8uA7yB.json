Quanta \u2019 s facility is close to other Apple suppliers across Asia , making it possible for Apple to achieve lower shipping costs than if it shipped components to the U.S .\nWhile the Mac Pro isn \u2019 t one of Apple \u2019 s bigger products , the decision on where to make it carries outsize significance .
