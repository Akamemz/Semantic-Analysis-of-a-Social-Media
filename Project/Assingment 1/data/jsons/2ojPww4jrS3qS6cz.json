By 1990 , with the loss of their Soviet patron and its $ 5 billion annual subsidy , Ra\u00fal \u2019 s doubts crystallized into alarm even while his brother Fidel hunkered down , resisting reform . And though Ra\u00fal took power in 2006 , it would be six years before he could finally overrule his ailing brother , who turned 89 years old on Thursday .\n\u201c There has been a sibling tug of war between Ra\u00fal and Fidel since childhood , \u201d Domingo Amuchastegui , a former Cuban intelligence officer , tells me over lunch this summer at Versailles , the restaurant that serves as the mecca of Cuban life in Miami . Versailles bills itself as the \u201c most famous Cuban restaurant in the world , \u201d and Amuchastegui is no stranger to its mirrored dining room . I \u2019 ve learned over more than two decades of covering Cuba that Amuchastegui has uncommon insights into the Caribbean island that has bedeviled every American president since Dwight Eisenhower .
