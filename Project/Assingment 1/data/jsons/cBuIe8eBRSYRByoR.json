Even so , the most popular proposal among voters for reducing the deficit is -- you guessed it -- raising taxes on the rich .\nIn addition , while a majority of Republicans ( 59 percent ) thinks major cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare should be made now , even if it is tough on families , a majority of Democrats ( 52 percent ) thinks those programs should continue to be funded at their current levels , even if it means passing on trillions of dollars of debt to future generations .\nOverall , 61 percent of voters say major spending cuts are necessary to reduce the deficit , while 33 percent think increasing taxes on high earners would be enough . Half of Democrats think taxing the rich is all that is needed . By contrast , majorities of Republicans ( 77 percent ) and independents ( 62 percent ) think cutting spending is also necessary .\nIf income taxes go up , almost all voters -- 89 percent -- think President Obama should agree to make major cuts in government spending as well .

The so-called \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d means that unless the president and Congress reach an agreement , on January 1 tax rates will automatically go up for almost all Americans while spending on many government programs will automatically be cut .\nBy a 10-point margin , more voters than not think an agreement will be made before the deadline ( 51-41 percent ) .\nA 52-percent majority says it would be \u201c terrible \u201d for the economy if the country goes over the cliff , yet 37 percent say it wouldn \u2019 t be that bad . Voters are about equally likely to say it would be terrible for them personally if no agreement is reached ( 46 percent ) as they are to say it wouldn \u2019 t be so bad for their family ( 44 percent ) .\nWhile 34 percent of voters think the \u201c only way \u201d to get the deficit under control is for the country to go over the cliff , fewer -- 12 percent -- say they actually want the nation to do so .\nOne in five voters who describe themselves as \u201c very \u201d conservative wants the country to go over the fiscal cliff ( 19 percent ) .\nMore voters think the president ( 38 percent ) has a plan to deal with the deficit issues than think the same about Republicans ( 26 percent ) .
