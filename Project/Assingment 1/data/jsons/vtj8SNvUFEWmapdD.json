He repeatedly has denied any such encounter .\nDemocrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , which is investigating Russian interference in the presidential election last year and any Trump campaign collusion , first tried in March to validate the prostitute portion of the unverified Trump-Russia dossier . The attempts were made during questioning of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and Navy Adm. Mike Rogers , director of the National Security Agency .\nMore recently , Democrats insisted on calling as a witness Mr. Trump \u2019 s former bodyguard and close aide Keith Schiller . A former New York City detective , Mr. Schiller accompanied Mr. Trump to Moscow , where he traveled to plan his Miss Universe pageant . He later sold the beauty contest .\nMr. Schiller testified in closed session about one particular night , a source familiar with ongoing congressional investigations told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Mr. Schiller said some people , who were not identified , offered five prostitutes but Mr. Schiller declined .\nHe said he later told his boss as they returned to the Ritz-Carlton , and they both had a laugh .
