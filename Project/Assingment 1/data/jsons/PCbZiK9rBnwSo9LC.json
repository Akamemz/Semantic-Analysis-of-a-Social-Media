More open-minded , more equalizing . \u201d\nYet one group of local clergy has been working hard to secure a seat at the table \u2013 arranging a series of intimate meetings with White House hopefuls . The Love 2020 participants have raced , sometimes with just a few hours \u2019 notice , to meet with candidates in churches , barns , anywhere they can get a brief audience with the person who might be their next president . They say they \u2019 re trying to reframe what faith-based political action can look like , and inject faith-based , moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics .\nIn 2008 , then-candidate Barack Obama \u2019 s campaign team called on religious leaders in New Hampshire individually , according to the Rev . Jason Wells , executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches . This cycle , campaigns don \u2019 t seem to be wooing faith leaders as they used to , Mr. Wells says .\nThe Rev .

He \u2019 s part of a group of New Hampshire clergy who have been meeting with White House hopefuls , in an effort to inject faith-based , moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics . For the candidates , these Love 2020 events offer a chance to get cozy with religious movers and shakers who , they hope , might sway some of the voters in their flocks .\nMr. Hopkins wants to know what each candidate will do to break the cycle of poverty for working people . So far , he \u2019 s participated in sit-downs with Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , and Pete Buttigieg , former mayor of South Bend , Indiana .\n\u201c We are asking questions that are not being asked of them in general , \u201d says Mr. Hopkins , pastor of Concordia Lutheran Church in Concord . It \u2019 s an arena where spirituality is explored \u2013 even with candidates like Senator Sanders , who describes himself as \u201c not particularly religious . \u201d\n\u201c Bernie , for sure , he \u2019 s got some spiritual depth , \u201d says Mr. Hopkins . \u201c Maybe not religious depth , but spiritual depth . ... He said we all should care about the least among us . \u201d\nSessions with 11 Democratic candidates and one Republican ( former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld ) were all open to the press , according to Love 2020 organizers . But when Mr. Buttigieg sat down with the group in early January at St. Paul \u2019 s Church in downtown Concord , campaign staffers insisted that this reporter wait outside , despite having been invited to cover the event . They gave no reason , saying only that the meeting was private .\nMr. Buttigieg , an Episcopalian , is hardly shy about his Christian faith , which he often invokes on the campaign trail as a moral guide for shaping policy positions . \u201c What \u2019 s important to me is to make sure that I \u2019 m engaging with [ faith leaders ] and with those that they guide and care for , \u201d he said after the meeting , as a black SUV waited to whisk him to a Nashua town hall event .
