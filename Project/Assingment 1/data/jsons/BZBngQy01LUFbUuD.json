    "content": "For the first time since 1992 , California \u2019 s Democratic presidential primary is back to its rightful place as the epilogue of the nominating process \u2014 even if The Associated Press declared Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee just before voters went to the polls .\nThe California results still matter : a Bernie Sanders victory here could fuel his case for taking his fight to the party convention in July . And in the nation \u2019 s largest state , the battle likely comes down to heavily populated , highly diverse Los Angeles .\nClinton and Sanders \u2019 respective paths through all of the states voting on Tuesday \u2014 California , Montana , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 include concentrations of white voters , black voters , Latinos , Asians , urban centers , some of the nation \u2019 s largest suburbs , seaside communities on both coasts , vast rural expanses , large universities and towns that border either Canada or Mexico .\nIn California , Clinton will depend on winning traditional African-American communities and Latino voters in the populous Los Angeles area , and she has been advertising on Asian radio outlets in both Los Angeles and San Francisco . Sanders , who polls show is winning large majorities of younger voters across racial and gender lines , will look to run up the score on Clinton in communities with greater numbers of young voters , along with liberal bastions like San Francisco .\nHispanic voters will also be highly sought-after in New Mexico , where both campaigns have been running TV ads . In New Jersey , where polls show Clinton way ahead , she \u2019 ll seek to run up the score in the New York and Philadelphia suburbs , along with smaller cities like Newark and Camden .\nThe political geography of Tuesday \u2019 s primaries and caucuses also takes the race to places that , because of the typically late voting dates , are often inconsequential \u2014 but occasionally decisive . But these states haven \u2019 t always voted late .\nCalifornia moved up its primary to Super Tuesday starting in 1996 , and when Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama there eight years ago , the hard-fought primary was held on Feb. 5 .\nThe primary was slotted back to June in 2012 , when Obama was the only Democratic candidate on the ballot .\nAlong with other states in which Democrats will head to the polls on Tuesday , including New Jersey and New Mexico , the early June date holds great historical significance : Then-Sen. Robert Kennedy won the June 4 , 1968 , California primary but was shot and killed leaving the Los Angeles hotel ballroom where he had celebrated his victory . Triumphs by George McGovern on June 6 , 1972 , in New Mexico and winner-take-all California helped him polish off Sen. Hubert Humphrey ( D-Minn. ) .\nGary Hart was an extreme underdog to win the nomination heading into the states that voted on June 5 , 1984 . And even though the Colorado senator won primaries that day in California and New Mexico , Democrats in New Jersey chose Walter Mondale \u2014 after Hart took a few offhand rhetorical digs at the Garden State .\nDelegates Remaining : 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination\nThe final early June California primary came in 1992 , when Bill Clinton beat Jery Brown there ( in addition to more significant wins in New Jersey and New Mexico ) to quash the anyone-but-Clinton movement and lock down the nomination headed into the convention \u2014 a feat his wife hopes to repeat Tuesday .\nHere are eight places to watch on Tuesday night as the results flow in :\nLos Angeles County : L.A. County doesn \u2019 t just produce more than a quarter of Democratic primary votes statewide \u2014 it \u2019 s also prime battleground territory : The county , which includes the city of Los Angeles and most of its suburbs , went for Clinton over Obama in 2008 , 55 percent to 42 percent .\nIt \u2019 s a place Clinton needs to win in order to prevail statewide , and the former secretary of state leads among L.A. County voters in pre-election polls from USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times ( 46 percent to 42 percent among registered voters ) , The Field Poll ( 50 percent to 40 percent ) and NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist ( 54 percent to 40 percent ) .\nThe county is extremely diverse : According to the latest Census estimates , 27 percent of residents are white , 9 percent black , 48 percent Hispanic and 15 percent Asian . But polls show voters split more by age than ethnicity , with Sanders winning big among younger Latinos and Clinton ahead by big margins among older Latinos .\nSouthern California : After L.A. County , the remainder of vote-rich Southern California is also up for grabs on Tuesday . Eight years ago , some of Clinton \u2019 s strongest performances in significantly representative counties came from Southern California .\nThese counties include large numbers of white voters , some of whom have defected to Sanders this year . But they also contain substantial Hispanic populations , and exit polls have showed Clinton winning Latinos in most states .\nOrange County , where Clinton beat Obama by more than 18 points , is still Republican territory in the general election \u2014 Mitt Romney won it by 6 points in 2012 \u2014 but it produced more than 200,000 votes in the 2008 Democratic primary .\nClinton ran up even larger margins in San Bernardino County ( 23 points ) and Riverside County ( 24 points ) .\nSan Diego County was more competitive , with Clinton beating Obama there , 50 percent to 43 percent .\nEast Bay/Santa Clara County : Sanders is likely to win San Francisco , but Clinton can negate some of Sanders \u2019 advantage in the progressive stronghold by holding her own in three counties across the bay : Contra Costa , Alameda and Santa Clara .\nEight years ago , two of the three counties produced more votes than San Francisco : Obama won Alameda , 52 percent to 44 percent , thanks in part to black voters in Oakland , many of whom will back Clinton this time , but also students on the campus of the University of California Berkeley who appear more aligned with Sanders this time .\nClinton won a nearly 13-point victory in Santa Clara County , which produced roughly as many votes as Alameda , 54 percent to 41 percent .\nContra Costa , which is the least-populous of the three counties , was closer , with Clinton edging Obama , 49 percent to 44 percent .\nTwo of the three polls released last week gave Sanders the edge in the Bay Area overall , though Clinton led him there in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll .\nAlbuquerque/Santa Fe : New Mexico held party-run caucuses in 2008 , not a state primary , with Clinton narrowly edging Obama .\nClinton won a majority of Hispanic voters in 2008 , according to exit polls , while Obama won the majority of white voters . As a result , Obama won two of the state \u2019 s three congressional districts , including the 1st , which includes the city of Albuquerque .\nObama also won narrowly in the Third District , which includes all of Northern New Mexico but is anchored by the city of Santa Fe . Sanders figures to run strong in Santa Fe and the smaller , overwhelmingly Democratic city of Taos .\nDo\u00f1a Ana County , N.M. : Clinton carried the Second District , which spans southern New Mexico , in 2008 .\nDo\u00f1a Ana County , home to Las Cruces , is the second-largest in the state . It also includes areas that border Mexico , in addition to bordering El Paso County , Texas . While the GOP race is virtually uncontested , five other since-departed candidates will appear on the ballot along with Donald Trump \u2014 giving Republicans who disapprove of Trump \u2019 s recent comments on Hispanics and his immigration stances a number of options to defect .\nNortheast Jersey : Areas of North Jersey along the Hudson River aren \u2019 t politically or racially homogeneous . Bergen County , the state \u2019 s most populous , voted for Clinton over Obama in 2008 , 59 percent to 39 percent . That \u2019 s about equal to the county \u2019 s white population , 59 percent , with most of the ethnic minorities being Hispanic ( 19 percent ) or Asian ( 16 percent ) . Clinton also won big in Hudson County , which includes Jersey City and Hoboken .\nMajority-minority Essex County , on the other hand , backed Obama , 57 percent to 42 percent . The county is anchored by Newark , the state \u2019 s largest city , where whites constitute only 12 percent of the population . But it also includes some wealthier New York suburbs , too .\nCamden County , N.J. : While most will think of the eponymous , majority-black city , Camden County also includes some tony Philadelphia suburbs , including Cherry Hill and Haddonfield . Clinton actually carried Camden County by a solid margin in 2008 , with 55 percent of the vote .\nClinton is expected to carry New Jersey easily , but Camden County will be a good test of whether she can bring aboard African-American voters who supported Obama without losing the white voters who carried her eight years ago .\nSanders County , Montana : This county makes the list purely for symbolic reasons : Sanders has won eight of the nine Clinton counties across the map , with Clinton \u2019 s lone win coming in Clinton County , Kentucky .\nThe only Sanders County in the U.S. is in northern Montana \u2014 population 11,000 \u2014 and it isClinton \u2019 s only chance to turn the tables .",
