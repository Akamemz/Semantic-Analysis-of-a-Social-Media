    "content": "HARLAN , Ky.\u2014Since he was laid off from his mining job in January , William Hensley 's life has been upended .\nDays after he lost his position , Mr. Hensley , 50 years old , said he was diagnosed with black lung disease . The bank soon took back his 2012 Chevy Suburban , after he was unable to make the $ 600 monthly payments . He can no longer afford health insurance and has drawn down all but $ 5,000 he had in a 401 ( k ) retirement plan to pay for another vehicle and living expenses .\nMr. Hensley , who is raising his 12-year-old granddaughter with his wife , went from making $ 82,000 a year as an underground foreman to collecting about $ 15,000 in unemployment benefits this year . But that aid is set to run out in December and mining jobs are scarce .\n`` This is the worst I 've ever seen it , '' said Mr. Hensley , who has spent 32 years of his life mining coal .\nUnprecedented pressures on the U.S. coal industry and nearly two years of mine closures and layoffs are reshaping the heart of the Central Appalachian coalfields in ways that many experts believe could be permanent .\nWhile the coal industry overall is losing market share to abundant natural gas , mines in Central Appalachia have become increasingly uneconomical . Natural gas is cheaper , and so is coal mined in two other big coal basins centered in Wyoming and Illinois .\nEastern Kentucky 's Harlan was a once-thriving coal mining town . David Stephenson for The Wall Street Journal\nHarlan has seen both the number of active mines and mine workers decline sharply . David Stephenson for The Wall Street Journal\nA Wall Street Journal analysis of Mine Safety and Health Administration data reveals that the picture is bleakest across a swath of 26 counties in Kentucky 's eastern coalfields , where coal has been the lifeblood for more than a century .\nThe number of coal-mining and related jobs in the region remained fairly steady between 2000 through 2011 , fluctuating from one quarter to the next by an average of about 400 jobs , but never dipping below 11,400 . Since 2011 , the area has seen an unrelenting decline that left eastern Kentucky with just 8,000 mining jobs in the second quarter of this year . State officials say there are now fewer miners working in Kentucky than any other time in records dating to the 1920s\u2014a decline largely driven by the eastern slice of the state .\nThe state 's eastern coalfields had 161 active mines in the second quarter of this year , down from an average of 256 active mines for the four quarters of 2011 , according to the analysis of the federal data .\n`` We 're at a difficult crossroads , '' said Joe Grieshop , Harlan County judge executive , the county 's highest elected position . There were 22 mines with coal production in the second quarter of this year , down from 44 at the beginning of 2011 , according to the MSHA data .\n`` I have to ground people in a reality where the jobs wo n't come back , '' said Mr. Grieshop .\nAt the same time , competition among mines has heated up . It costs utilities about 40 % more to generate the same amount of electricity using the region 's coal compared with coal from Wyoming , according to industry analysts . Coal from Wyoming does n't generate as much electricity per ton and costs more to transport . Still , it is a better deal for utilities because the costs to mine coal from seams 60-feet thick are far less .\nIn Central Appalachia , the region 's coal seams are thinner , and so are mining companies ' profit margins . It typically costs $ 60 to $ 70 to extract a ton of coal there , while the current price for coal from the region used by utilities , known as thermal coal , is under $ 65 a ton .\nEven West Virginia and Virginia have some advantages over eastern Kentucky . They possess higher grades of coal , including more reserves of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking that currently sell for about $ 150 a ton . Less direct rail routes out of eastern Kentucky also make its coal more expensive to transport .\nThe region 's troubles run deeper than the rest of Central Appalachia and are accelerating . Eastern Kentucky , which produced more than 128 million tons of coal in 1990 , mined just 45 million tons in 2012 . That was a decline of more than 18 million tons from 2011 's output , the biggest single-year drop in records dating to 1984 , the Journal analysis of the data shows .\nThe human toll is starkly evident . In Kentucky 's Harlan County , the number of mining jobs had fallen 48 % from 2011 through June , according to the Journal analysis . The county 's unemployment rate had risen to 16.3 % as of August , the 13th highest of more than 3,000 counties in the nation , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates .\nSome declines are sharper in neighboring counties . As of June , mining jobs were down 54 % in Letcher County from 2011 , and laid-off miners are the equivalent of nearly half of unemployed workers . In smaller Knott County , mining jobs are down 68 % from 2011 , and the number of laid-off miners roughly equals the county 's unemployed population .\nAnalysts have started to compare Central Appalachia to other mined-out areas around the globe , such as Germany 's Ruhr valley , or Great Britain , which employed 6,000 coal miners last year , compared with 150,000 in 1983 , according to the British government .\n`` There are tipping points where the basin is simply uncompetitive against new supply sources , and one could argue that this may have occurred for Central Appalachia , '' said Lucas Pipes , an analyst with Brean Capital LLC , a New York-based investment bank .\nThe coal industry is notoriously cyclical . These counties have suffered and bounced back before , but local officials say the current bust is like none that have preceded it . Leaders , including Rep. Hal Rogers , a Republican , and Gov . Steve Beshear , a Democrat , are scrambling to come up with a plan to diversify the region 's economy , but some fear any such efforts are too late .\nUnemployed miners are shellshocked by the rapid pace of shutdowns that began in early 2012 . A handful arrive early each morning at the Kentucky Career Center office in downtown Harlan to fill out paperwork and take classes needed to extend their unemployment insurance benefits .\nThe marquee at the Molus Pentecostal Church near Harlan displays support for laid-off miners . David Stephenson for the Wall Street Journal\nThey share word of mining companies hiring , but the job prospects are now in other coal regions , six hours away in western Kentucky where mines are still hiring , or in Alabama , Illinois or Wyoming . On a recent day , there were 45 listings within a 25-mile radius of Harlan on the career center 's website . Most were posted by Pizza Hut and retailers .\nIn the city of Harlan , the mountain-encircled county seat near the western tip of Virginia , the owners of a furniture store , a bridal shop , a hair salon , an auto repair service and a florist all said their business is down 30 % or more compared to last year . Residents recall a Greyhound station where buses stopped and turned around to go back the way they came . Even that is gone .\n`` You do n't pass through Harlan County to get to anywhere else . It 's a cul-de-sac of coal , '' said Jeff Whitehead , executive director of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program .\nSince January , the 23-county agency has used funds from a two-year $ 5.2 million grant from the U.S. Labor Department to retrain 407 unemployed miners . The program has so far helped another 430 find new jobs in manufacturing , construction and health care .\nChris Sexton , 32 , of Blackey , Ky. , in Letcher County , followed his grandfathers , father and brother into the mines a week after he graduated high school . After he was laid off in June 2012 , he decided to train to be an emergency medical technician , which now pays him $ 12 an hour , compared to $ 26 an hour he earned as a miner . `` I 'm happy at what I do , '' he said , but added that he would consider going back underground . `` It 's like they always say : The coal dust gets in your blood . ''\nThose with mining jobs are grateful for them . `` I guess I 'm one of the few left , '' said Garry Cox , 53 , who now works as a foreman at a surface mine earning $ 14.40 an hour , much less than he once earned during three decades of mining . He said he hopes to hold on to his hillside home .\nIn interviews with more than two dozen unemployed miners , nearly all blamed President Barack Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency for their plight . They cited a series of regulations to tighten emissions rules for coal-burning power plants , which they said amounted to what has popularly been called a `` war on coal . ''\nPaul Swanson , a laid-off coal miner since Thanksgiving of 2012 , waits for an appointment at the Kentucky Career Center in Harlan in October . David Stephenson for The Wall Street Journal\n`` Obama 's starving us out . He ai n't got a clue , '' said Paul Swanson , 46 , of Cawood , Ky. , who was laid off the day before Thanksgiving in 2012 from a mine with a 27-inch-thick coal seam , which requires miners to work on their knees . After his lengthy unemployment , he said he no longer can afford a phone .\nMost coal industry executives see the situation as more complex . They say the stepped-up regulations have exacerbated a market depression brought about by new fracking technologies that have revolutionized natural gas drilling and made it possible to tap massive reservoirs of gas from deep shale layers .\n`` We 're in a structural shift as a result of the regulatory environment , '' said Kevin Crutchfield , chief executive of Alpha Natural Resources Inc. of Bristol , Va. `` I do n't think the scale would be nearly as great '' without increased regulations .\nAn EPA spokeswoman said the agency 's `` regulatory approach toward the power sector seeks to ensure a clear path forward for coal . '' The U.S. Energy Information Administration currently projects coal 's share of electricity generation will continue to fall over the next few decades but remain the largest fuel source used by power plants .\nCoal accounted for 39 % of U.S. electricity generation through August of this year , compared to 27 % for natural gas . In 2003 , coal powered 51 % of generation , compared to 17 % for natural gas .\nUtilities have frequently cited new emissions standards among reasons for closing aging coal-fired power plants . Roughly 9 % of coal-fired capacity is slated for closure between 2013 and 2018 , according to the EIA .\nAlpha , the nation 's third-largest coal operator by production and the biggest in Central Appalachia , has laid off 594 workers at Kentucky mines and related coal facilities since January 2012 . It now operates 10 underground mines in the state , down from 23 underground and six surface mines in 2011 . It also shut four facilities that process coal .\n`` It 's devastating , to say the least , '' Mr. Crutchfield said . He said he has had discussions with elected officials about helping to diversify the region 's economy .\n`` We 've got to start thinking about this longer-term , '' he said , but added , `` diversifying the economy , while it sounds good , is not going to help these folks immediately . ''\nScott Shepherd , a guidance counselor at Harlan County High School , said that until recently , nearly one of five graduating students found employment in coal-related jobs . But last year , few if any graduates did so . Now more students are talking to military recruiters or planning to get training in nursing or move from the area , he said .\nHe said that without a nearby community college that provides training for health-care jobs , `` we would be in dire trouble . ''\nIn the near term , laid-off miners and local businesses struggle , especially as unemployment insurance benefits are expected to run out for more people over the next several months .\nAt the Harlan Pawn Shop , Bill Jones has stopped taking helmets and other equipment from miners . He said the rate at which people reclaim their pawned goods has fallen , from about 80 % to 60 % , and the quality of items being offered is wanting . Meanwhile , shop sales are down about 30 % this year .\n`` We 're a bank here for poor people . I 'm loaning more money out than ever , but they 're not picking the stuff up , '' said Mr. Jones .\nUnemployed miner Everett Napier , 37 , said he pawned various items at Mr. Jones 's shop while he has been looking for work , including rifles , tools , jewelry and two guitars he used to play at church . `` I just swallowed my pride and quit playing .
