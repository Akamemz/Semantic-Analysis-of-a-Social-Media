NBC's Kristen Welker has more for us from the White House. KRISTEN WELKER: Big name Democrats have been blanketing the campaign trail for weeks. HILLARY CLINTON: I'm back! WELKER: Some suspected of testing the waters for their own future bids but noticeably absent from the main event, Democrats tough fight to keep the Senate: President Obama. THE WASHINGTON POST\u2019S CHRIS CILLIZZA: The President is not really wanted by Democrats, even in states that he carried in 2008 and 2012. WELKER: He'll likely stay away from places like Alaska, Iowa, Colorado and Pennsylvania. The trepidation was palpable this past week, when Allison Lundergan-Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate in Kentucky, wouldn't even say if she voted for the President. LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Did you vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012? ALLISON LUNDERGAN-GRIMES: You know, this election isn't about the President. It\u2019s about making \u2013 LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: I know \u2013 LUNDERGAN-GRIMES: It is about making sure we put Kentuckians back to work. WELKER: And New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen also distanced herself when Andrea Mitchell asked if Shaheen wanted Mr. Obama to campaign for her. NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D): Well, the President\u2019s dealing with a lot of crisis in the world right now, so I expect him to be in Washington. WELKER: With his approval ratings hovering in the mid-to-low 40s, the President may have given Republicans an opening when he said his policies are on the ballot even though he's not. PAT ROBERTS FOR SENATE CAMPAIGN AD: A vote for Greg Orman is a vote for the Obama agenda. WELKER: Once called the campaigner-in-chief, the President is more like a fundraiser-in-chief, attending more than 50 events this year. CILLIZZA: He remains a huge draw that is the largest and best fundraiser we've ever seen. WELKER: On Wednesday, the President will headline a rally for the Connecticut\u2019s Democratic governor, his first big event of the midterm cycle, a cautious campaigner with the Senate hanging in the balance.
