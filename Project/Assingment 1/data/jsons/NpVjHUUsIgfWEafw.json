At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nSome argue that Saudi Arabia has \u201c been exporting their murderous anti-Americanism for decades . Their citizens were behind 9/11 and they bear a fair amount of responsibility for the rise of ISIS as well . They \u2019 ve been fighting Yemen forever and their current war has included endless atrocities\u2026 Internally they \u2019 re as repressive a regime as you can imagine , even more so than Iran . Just recently they murdered a critic and then carved him up with a bone saw to get rid of the evidence . They are forever trying to get America to lay down American lives in their endless proxy wars against Shiite Iran\u2026 nothing Iran has done holds even a tiny candle to Saudi Arabia \u2019 s behavior . \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\n\u201c Whether it 's a Trump-Rouhani meeting in New York or private discussions between US and Iranian experts to lay out the parameters for meaningful negotiations , the national security team should not miss the forest for the trees : Iran is a bad actor , but by making a series of policy missteps the administration has aggravated those threats . Removing any one of those threats , starting with nuclear ones , should be a priority . Doing so will require the President to do something out of character -- admit that he was wrong about withdrawing from the nuclear deal without any realistic plan to renegotiate it. \u201d Samantha Vinograd , CNN\n\u201c The problem is that our maximum pressure is putting the Islamic Republic in a corner economically but not politically or militarily\u2026 One possibility might be for the administration to propose that the French host a meeting of the parties to the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , as well as Germany and the Iranians \u2014 with the aim of discussing the Iranian nuclear program and the regional dangers . True , there is a risk that the United States will come under pressure to rejoin the nuclear deal or drop sanctions , but the Iranians and the other participants should also know that if this fails , a dangerous escalation could be the result\u2026 if Trump is to avoid a crisis that might soon spin out of control , he will have to act soon. \u201d Dennis Ross , Washington Post\n\u201c Mr . Trump \u2019 s ability to respond effectively is severely limited compared to previous U.S. presidents . Few believe his pronouncements , so barring the presentation of overwhelming evidence , claims of Iranian responsibility will not persuade even close U.S. allies . European states that joined U.S. operations to secure the Persian Gulf in the past are very reluctant to do so now , because they fear Mr. Trump will drag them into a war . Even some of Iran \u2019 s foremost adversaries don \u2019 t want a conflict with Iran presided over by an erratic and unstable U.S. president , who already canceled one military strike at the last minute . The attack should not go unanswered , but the best response may not be a military one . \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c The idea that the United States military would be at the beck and call of Saudi leaders was odd enough . But then Trump clarified Monday morning that it wasn \u2019 t even about us needing Saudi oil . \u2018 We don \u2019 t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas , & in fact have very few tankers there , but will help our Allies ! \u2019 he said . So the \u2018 America First \u2019 president who pledged a noninterventionist foreign policy is threatening to go to a war with little strategic interest for the United States because ... he just wants to help ? \u201d Aaron Blake , Washington Post\nOn Sunday , \u201c President Trump declared that the United States was \u2018 locked and loaded , \u2019 a phrase that seemed to suggest he was ready to strike back . But then he promised to wait for Saudi Arabia to tell him \u2018 under what terms we would proceed. \u2019 His message on Twitter offered a remarkable insight into the deference Mr. Trump gives to the Saudi royal family\u2026 It was hard to imagine him allowing NATO , or a European ally , such latitude to determine how the United States should respond . But for Mr. Trump , the Saudis have always been a special case , their economic import having often overwhelmed other considerations in his mind\u2026 \u201c In his comments to reporters on Monday , Mr. Trump seemed intent on avoiding the perception that he was taking direction from the Saudis . If there is any response to the strikes on the oil facilities , he said , then the Saudis would play a part themselves \u2014 if nothing else , by financing it . Which , of course , made it sound like the United States was willing to be , in effect , a mercenary force for the Saudis. \u201d Peter Baker and David E. Sanger , New York Times\nSome argue that \u201c Iran \u2019 s Sept. 14 drone attack against oil facilities in Saudi Arabia was not a mere nation-against-nation dust-up , but an assault against the global economy . As the nation with the greatest wherewithal to retaliate without escalating the retaliation into a full-scale regional war , the United States is well positioned to teach Iran a lesson it won \u2019 t soon forget\u2026 The U.S. has the capability to penetrate Iranian air defenses , cripple a few Iranian facilities with highly targeted air strikes , and leave without providing Iran an obvious target at which to hit back . Iran does not have the force-projection capabilities to strike back at the U.S . \u201d\n\u201c The game changer in international oil markets is the audacity of the attack , in its precision and exposure of the vulnerability of Saudi oil infrastructure . And now everyone knows it can happen again . This is n't about Saudi Arabia at all . It is about American leadership and commitment to a global economic order\u2026 Pompeo and the Donald Trump administration must now follow through with ramifications for the accusation against Iran . If Tehran is responsible , they must share evidence of Iran 's culpability in the attacks . And then the United States must act , and act resolutely . To decline retribution would only embolden Iran and its Houthi allies . \u201d\nOthers urge diplomatic pressure . \u201c The U.S. has long been the guardian of the Gulf and can not allow this sensitive region , with its ample oil reserves , to be hostage to Iranian terrorism . [ But ] this is not to suggest a rush to rash action . The Islamic Republic has offered us a unique opportunity to mobilize the international community against it . Iran \u2019 s remaining oil customers should be pressed to discontinue their purchases and thus their further subsidization of a regime bent on breaking international law . The theocracy \u2019 s most important vulnerability is still its weakening economy , and it is that nerve that Washington should continue pinching . Given this latest Iranian act of terror , the Trump administration may have stumbled on a unique opportunity to multi-lateralize its strategy of maximum pressure . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c American energy independence , finally realized under the policies of President Donald Trump , means \u2018 no blood for oil. \u2019 And that \u2019 s true even when the world \u2019 s oil supply is threatened\u2026 America is in a stronger position now than it was ten years ago when similar geopolitical circumstances caused oil prices to skyrocket to an all-time high of $ 146 a barrel\u2026 right now , in coal mines and in fracking fields and on oil rigs and ocean platforms across this nation , there are millions of American energy workers whose toil and sweat mean that our energy security is sovereignty . Their labor in our energy industry means fewer of our brave military will go overseas to protect , fight , and die , for America \u2019 s interests . \u201d\n\u201c There are plenty of reasons why prudence demands the United States does not pull the trigger . For one , there is no formal defense alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia , which means that we are not obligated to come to their defense . And Iran , never content with exhibiting weakness , would most certainly respond if American missiles started flying into their airspace . There is no way for President Trump to be confident that a U.S. operation against Tehran wouldn \u2019 t spiral into a full-blown war\u2026 \u200d \u201c One of the most compelling reasons Trump should not launch an attack , however , is constitutional . Without an authorization from Congress , an attack against Iran would be illegal , unconstitutional , and a violation of separation of powers . The president may be the commander in chief , but the Congress holds the ultimate power over when and where the country goes to war . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
