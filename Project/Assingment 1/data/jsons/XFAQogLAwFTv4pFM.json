Marco Rubio declared in an exclusive \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV interview that the nation \u2019 s middle-class consumers will be hardest hit by President Barack Obama \u2019 s proposed tax increases. \u201c When you raise taxes , the money has to come out of the private economy , \u201d Rubio , the first-term GOP senator , tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It \u2019 s coming out of a business somewhere , whose taxes are going to go up. \u201c So how do businesses react ? It has to raise the prices of their goods or services , which means the consumer is going to pay more . They \u2019 re going to cut back on how much they pay people or how many people they do hire . So they \u2019 re going to feel it at their place of employment . Sometimes they close down , which means they lose their jobs . And , a lot of the people whose taxes are going to go up are , in fact , middle-class folks. \u201c What we need to make clear to people is that these taxes that the president \u2019 s proposing to raise is going to hit a lot of small businesses and mid-sized businesses that pay on their personal rate , \u201d Rubio added . \u201c Over half of the private-sector workers in America work for the kinds of businesses that the president wants to raise taxes on. \u201c And we get nothing in return for this in terms of the debt . The revenue that these increases would generate won \u2019 t even cover nine days \u2019 worth of government . So we \u2019 re not going to make any difference to the debt , but we \u2019 re going to hurt job creation. \u201d Rubio , who received a leadership award on Tuesday from the Jack Kemp Foundation in Washington , said that reforming the tax code is as critical as raising tax revenue to reaching a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. \u201c I support tax reform , which means flattening the tax code and looking at all of the exemptions and getting rid of those that don \u2019 t make any sense \u2014 but not as a way of generating revenue \u2014 but as a way of simplifying the tax code. \u201c The only way out of this hole that you \u2019 ve got to do both , have fiscal discipline , \u201d Rubio said . \u201c That means holding the line on future spending , with rapid economic growth to generate revenue . Not through new taxes , but through taxpayers . I will not support anything that doesn \u2019 t do both. \u201c We have to hold the line on spending , because if you grow your economy and generate more revenue \u2014 but you grow spending by as much or more \u2014 then you \u2019 re not doing anything . On the other hand , the only way you \u2019 re ever going to generate the revenue we need to fund basic government and bring down the debt is through rapid , vibrant economic growth \u2014 and you \u2019 re never going to get that with these tax increases. \u201c So I \u2019 m not supporting anything that hurts job creation , \u201d Rubio said.And there \u2019 s no other way around it , the former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives reiterated. \u201c You have to do both . Obviously , I would start always with the tax code , because it impacts a broader swath of people in the country . But regulations are right there with it , because regulations are like a tax . They cost money to comply with . And , every penny you have to spend complying with these taxes is money you don \u2019 t have to give your employees raises or hire more people or grow your business. \u201c A business either has to pass through these costs or they have to close , \u201d he said . \u201c And that \u2019 s not good for economy. \u201d Rubio remains optimistic that Capitol Hill will reach a fiscal deal before the end of the year. \u201c My hope is we \u2019 ll get something done . The immediate challenge is not doing anything that harms our economy , and then we need to really sit down in as bipartisan a way as possible and figure out how to solve our long-term problems. \u201d \u201c The fundamental problem we face , the real fiscal cliff , is that we owe $ 16 trillion and growing \u2014 and we spend $ 1 trillion a year more than we take in , \u201d Rubio added . \u201c We can \u2019 t keep doing that . It \u2019 s going to catch up with us sooner rather than later . In fact , we \u2019 re getting closer and closer to that point. \u201c I hope that everyone around here will take that very seriously because what they \u2019 re playing \u2018 chicken \u2019 with is the greatest country in the history of the world , the most important country on the planet \u2014 and there \u2019 s a lot at stake here. \u201c The campaign \u2019 s over . It \u2019 s time to govern . \u201d",
