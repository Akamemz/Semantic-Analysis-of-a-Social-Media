Less discussed , however , is the degree to which the MLK estate \u2019 s tough stance on copyright affected the historical accuracy of the film\u2014and has affected many other films and books before it . What is lost when a biopic can not take full advantage of its main character \u2019 s rhetorical brilliance ? And what alternatives are available for filmmakers that want to produce history , not hagiography , about MLK ?\nSelma director Ava DuVernay may well have taken more license than artistically necessary in the confrontational scenes between Martin Luther King Jr. and President Johnson . But inaccuracies in other significant parts of the film were forced upon DuVernay by copyright law . The film \u2019 s numerous scenes of King delivering powerful speeches regarding civil rights all had to be paraphrased , because the MLK estate has already licensed the film rights in those speeches to DreamWorks and Warner Bros. , for an MLK biopic Steven Spielberg is slated to produce .\nThe litigious MLK estate , controlled now by King \u2019 s descendants , has a long history of employing copyright to restrict the use of King \u2019 s speeches . The estate appears to have two objectives : maximize revenue and control King \u2019 s image . In the 1990s , the estate sued USAToday for publishing the full text of the \u201c I Have a Dream \u201d speech King delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963 , and the newspaper quickly settled by paying for a license and attorneys \u2019 fees . The estate then sued CBS for including footage of the speech in a segment of its documentary series The 20th Century with Mike Wallace . In its defense in court , CBS argued that the speech had entered into the public domain because King had not complied with the notice and registration requirements of the Copyright Act of 1909 . The trial court agreed with CBS , but an appellate court reversed and ruled in favor of the MLK estate on narrow technical grounds . ( Specifically , although the speech was delivered to a live audience of several hundred thousand people and broadcast to millions more , the appellate court treated the delivery of the speech as only a limited publication of the underlying text that did not trigger the 1909 Act \u2019 s notice and registration requirements . )\nThe MLK estate also sued the producers of Eyes on the Prize , an Emmy-winning documentary series on the civil rights movement , for the use of unlicensed footage of King speeches . This litigation settled when the producers reportedly paid the estate $ 100,000 . Because of this dispute ( and similar issues with other rights-holders ) , the series was out of circulation from 1993 to 2006 , when PBS finally renewed most of the rights and edited the remaining unlicensed footage .\nDuring the summer of 2013 , as the nation was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington , the MLK estate restricted broadcasts of \u201c I Have a Dream , \u201d but it did not lock down the speech altogether : It authorized sales of DVDs of the speech , and it licensed AT & T to use segments of the speech in cell phone ads . Over the years , the MLK estate has also licensed King speeches to be used in ads by Alcatel , Apple , Chevrolet and Mercedes . And it received over $ 700,000 from the foundation erecting the MLK Memorial in Washington , D.C. , for the right to use MLK \u2019 s speeches and likeness in the Memorial .\nHow is it that one estate can control the use of speeches so central to American history 50 years after their delivery and 47 years after King \u2019 s tragic assassination ?\nOne reason is that King was a private citizen . Had King been a federal government official when he wrote his speeches , those writings would always have been in the public domain . But because King was the extraordinary national political figure who was not a federal employee , the copyrights belonged to him and passed to his estate upon his death .\nAnother issue is that the term of copyright protection has grown increasingly long . The first copyright act adopted by Congress in 1790 provided a term of protection of 14 years after first publication that could be renewed for an additional 14 years , for a total of 28 years . The initial purpose of the exclusive rights granted by the copyright law was to provide authors with an economic incentive to create works for the public good . At the same time , the duration of the author \u2019 s monopoly was limited so as to enable other authors to build on the first artist \u2019 s work .\nThanks to aggressive lobbying by publishers , the estates of authors and , more recently , the motion picture studios , Congress has repeatedly extended the copyright term . In 1831 , Congress extended it to two 21-year periods after first publication for a total of 42 years ; and in 1909 , Congress extended the term to two 28-year periods for a total of 56 years . Then , in the 1976 Copyright Act , in an effort to harmonize U.S. law with the international law of the Berne Convention , Congress lengthened the copyright term to the life of the author plus 50 years . In 1998 , Congress added 20 more years of protection , to the life of the author plus 70 years , citing the law of the European Union as an international precedent .\nThe extensions have always been retroactive , applying to works already in existence .
