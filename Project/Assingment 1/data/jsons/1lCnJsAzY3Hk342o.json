    "content": "Last Monday , Mar\u00eda Fel\u00edcitas Infante Zamora and her siblings heard from Texas prison officials that their father , Bartolo Infante , had died . Infante , 72 , had been in prison since 2000 for a sexual assault .\nThe family did not learn the cause of death directly from officials : They only learned that he had tested positive for COVID-19 from a news article they came across on Facebook days later .\nThen came another blow . Infante \u2019 s relatives could not afford to hold their own funeral , so the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said it would bury him at a prison cemetery . But the family would not be able to attend the burial because gatherings put people at increased risk of contracting or spreading the virus .\n\u201c They said , \u2018 We \u2019 re just going to give you a picture of him and that \u2019 s it , \u2019 \u201d Zamora said . The picture would be of her father \u2019 s body at his funeral on Thursday .\nInfante was incarcerated in the Telford Unit , near the Arkansas border , but will be buried at a prison cemetery in Huntsville , roughly 150 miles from Lockhart , where Zamora and her mother live .\nA TDCJ spokesman , Jeremy Desel , said he had no specific information about why the family was told they could not attend , but pointed out that outside of prisons , many funerals have been postponed as state and local governments ban public gatherings to halt virus transmission .\nAt least 63 people in state and federal custody have died from the coronavirus , according to data collected by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . We reached eight families who lost someone to the pandemic . Some are still wrangling with prison officials to even obtain the bodies of their loved ones and to learn basic information about their final days . And their grief is compounded by the fact they \u2019 ll have to mourn at a safe distance from their families as coronavirus puts large gatherings on hold .\nGiven the massive number of elderly prisoners around the country , deaths are hardly rare in federal and state prisons , as well as jails . Every state and county has its own protocol for what it will pay for and what happens when family members either can not be found or are unable or unwilling to handle the remains and arrangements .\nIn New York , the unclaimed are buried in mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx . In Illinois , where several people incarcerated at Stateville prison have died from coronavirus , the decision to bury or cremate the unclaimed dead is left up to each warden . Officials in New Jersey cover the cost of cremation for any unclaimed person .\nWhen Frank McCoy , who was incarcerated at FCI-Elkton , a federal prison in rural Lisbon , Ohio , died on April 2 , officials tried to reach his son Jason McCoy . McCoy says the first call came around 1:30 a.m . He didn \u2019 t pick up , so officials left a voicemail urging him to call back . When they didn \u2019 t hear from him after several days , the Bureau of Prisons sent a local police officer to his job to break the news .\nMcCoy \u2019 s mother had also recently passed away after a long battle with dementia . \u201c I lost both of my parents in a short time period , \u201d McCoy said . \u201c The last time I talked to [ my father ] was to tell him that mom died . \u201d\nBecause McCoy has no remaining family , he opted to have his father cremated and sent home in an urn . He says the bureau is paying for everything .\nThe average funeral can cost nearly $ 8,000 , according to the National Funeral Directors Association . A spokesperson for the prison bureau said they pay for \u201c preparation of the deceased inmate \u2019 s body , the casket , and transporting of the body to the family \u2019 s funeral home \u201d in some circumstances . But due to the \u201c high volume of inquiries , \u201d they are \u201c unable to address specific inmates \u2019 cases . \u201d\nAfter years of frustration over dealing with prison officials , some families have declined the bureau \u2019 s offer . The mother of Patrick Jones , the first federal prisoner to die from COVID-19 complications , decided she would pay for all the death arrangements herself , according to Jones \u2019 stepdaughter , Lateasha Crumpton-Scurry . \u201c She just wanted to have closure and see her son , \u201d Crumpton-Scurry said .\nMany of the first victims of coronavirus in prison died in nearby hospitals . Across the country , hospital staff have built makeshift morgues as people die in record numbers . As the bodies pile up , officials in some cities have shortened the window of time people have to claim their family members .\nIn Texas , state prisoners bury their peers in a state-run cemetery . Families , if they don \u2019 t handle the body themselves , are usually allowed to attend . But the Infante family \u2019 s experience suggests that the coronavirus may continue to upend policies . The family of Joe Kearney , the first Michigan state prisoner whose death is linked to COVID-19 , also said they were not allowed to see his body .\nLittle is currently known about how COVID-19 spreads from the recently deceased to the living . The World Health Organization has said that cadavers are \u201c generally not infectious , \u201d although researchers recently reported one case of a medical examiner contracting the virus from a dead body in Thailand .\nUnder normal circumstances , the death of an incarcerated family member is often shrouded in secrecy . When a prisoner is hospitalized , state and federal prison officials sometimes inform their relatives . But several families said officials would not provide hospital information , so they could not directly ask about the course of treatment or prognosis . Officials have also been criticized for exacerbating the trauma of families by leaving voicemails informing them of their relatives \u2019 death .\nA lack of information has frustrated Kathy Wilson , the wife of James Wilson , who died on March 29 at the federal prison in Oakdale , Louisiana , after testing positive for COVID-19 and suffering respiratory failure . Wilson said her husband \u201c seemed fine \u201d when they spoke a few days before his death . She is furious that she was never informed that he was severely ill. \u201c A wife should know that their husband is in a hospital with a virus , \u201d she said . \u201c Somebody there could have taken five minutes to call and tell me . \u201d\nWhen someone dies in prison , even without a pandemic , some families struggle for years to gain insight into their final days . Coronavirus has erected more barriers in their search for answers . Testing is limited in many facilities , and many family members say officials have not done enough to prevent the virus from spreading behind bars .\nEddie James may never find out if coronavirus killed his son . Ricky James died at Mid-State Correctional Facility in Fort Dix , New Jersey , on April 3 . James says the week before his son died , he had called his girlfriend several times to say he was sick and worried that his incessant coughing and chills were symptoms of coronavirus .\nBut according to James , the prison refused to test Ricky\u2014even after he died .

He \u2019 s 64 years old , and has been living with heart disease for several years .
