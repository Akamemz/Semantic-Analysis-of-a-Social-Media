    "content": "Republicans are accusing the Obama administration of unilaterally gutting welfare reform after the Department of Health and Human Services quietly notified states that they may seek a waiver for the program 's strict work requirements .\nHHS made the announcement in a policy memo Thursday , news that slipped well below the radar amid a raucous day on the presidential campaign trail . But a few prominent GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill picked up on the change , and accused the administration of overhauling one of the most important bipartisan agreements of the past several decades .\n`` President Obama just tore up a basic foundation of the welfare contract '' Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , said in a statement . He also called the move a `` blatant violation of the law . ''\nMitt Romney on Friday spoke up on the change , saying : `` President Obama now wants to strip the established work requirements from welfare . '' He said `` the linkage of work and welfare is essential to prevent welfare from becoming a way of life . ''\nHow exactly the HHS change will play out is unclear . In Thursday 's policy directive , the department said the states may seek a waiver from the work component of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program , in order to `` test alternative and innovative strategies , policies and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families . ''\nHHS stressed that any alternative should still aim to get welfare recipients into gainful employment . Any plan that `` appears substantially likely to reduce access to assistance or employment for needy families , '' will not be approved , the memo said .\nBut HHS is suddenly allowing for more flexibility in a program known -- and in many circles , lauded -- for its rigid framework . Currently , states have to have 50 percent of their caseload meet certain work participation requirements , though there are ways around that as many states fall short .\nThe latest department directive suggested alternative plans could `` combine learning and work '' to fulfill the work requirement , or let `` vocational educational training or job search /readiness programs '' count as well .\nThe administration defended the move in a blog on the HHS website . George Sheldon , acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families , said states will be held `` accountable '' for their alternative plans . He pitched the changes as a response to states burdened by current rules and guidelines .\n`` The new steps we have taken will give states more flexibility in how they operate the Temporary Assistance to Need Families program . And the steps we have taken were specifically requested by states led by officials from both parties , '' he wrote . `` When the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) program was established as part of welfare reform in the 1990s , it was intended to give states flexibility to design effective programs to help parents move from welfare to work . Today , however , Federal rules dictate mind-numbing details about how to run a welfare-to-work program . Most States and experts agree that these are n't helpful . ''\nThe hard-fought welfare reform agreement in 1996 was struck between the Bill Clinton administration and a Republican-led Congress . It is still considered a signature legislative achievement from that period .\nThe number of people on TANF has decreased dramatically since 1997 , but roughly 4 million people are still enrolled according to federal figures . The change comes in the middle of a competitive election fight between Obama and Romney .\nRep. Dave Camp , R-Mich. , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , and Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , have written to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking for a more detailed explanation of the change and her authority for making it . Both expressed concern that the change would strip the crux of the 1996 welfare reform deal .\n`` This ends welfare reform as we know it , '' Camp said in a statement .\n`` I 'm disappointed that after years of sitting on their hands and failing to propose any significant improvements to the TANF programs , the Obama Administration is once again over-stepping their authority and attempting to circumvent Congress through an unprecedented bypass of the legislative process , '' Hatch said .",
