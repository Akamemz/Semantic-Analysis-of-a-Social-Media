Here 's what 's really at stake\nMost political junkies spend Election Day scanning social media for exit polls and turnout predictions , or comparing data analysts to find out who will win or lose . The consequences of the vote for the lives of ordinary Americans must wait .\nThis year , the horse race hasn \u2019 t just overshadowed the policy implications , it has overwhelmed them . A key media narrative of these elections , perhaps one that has cynically created the very voter apathy pundits deride , has been that they hold no meaning , that gridlock will continue in Washington regardless of who controls the Senate , that nothing will actually change .\nBut there \u2019 s an old expression : You may not be interested in politics , but it \u2019 s definitely interested in you . Contrary to the bleating of a bored media elite , there \u2019 s plenty at stake in the midterms . Here \u2019 s a guide , inevitably incomplete , to the concrete policy questions surrounding Election Day .\nClaims that the elections have no meaning rest on a category error . Congressional elections share the ballot with thousands of state and local races . That includes 146 initiatives where policy is literally on the ballot , from the minimum wage ( Alaska , Arkansas , Nebraska and South Dakota ) to the war on drugs ( marijuana legalization in Alaska , Oregon and D.C. , drug sentencing reform in California ) to education funding ( 19 initiatives in 14 states ) and much more .\nBut 36 gubernatorial seats are also up for grabs , and in one of the closest elections in modern history , as many as 12 are within the margin of error . Regardless of legislative control , who runs states as blue as Massachusetts and Connecticut , as red as Alaska and Kansas , and as purple as Michigan , Wisconsin , Florida , Colorado and Maine really matters , and here \u2019 s why .\nPrivatization : A recent report by the Center for Media and Democracy listed several incidents of Republican governors unilaterally outsourcing public functions , from healthcare and education to prisons and economic development agencies . In states like Illinois , Rhode Island and Massachusetts , candidates with significant ties to financial firms could gain control of state pension funds , and hand them over . So these elections will determine how much of the public sector will be eroded in the next four years .\nConservative fiscal policy : As my colleague Thomas Frank reports , since 2010 Kansas government has become an Arthur Laffer napkin scribble sprung to life , with fairly miserable results . Voters can render a verdict on tax cuts and austerity by tossing out Gov . Sam Brownback . To a similar extent , Scott Walker \u2019 s destruction of public employee unions and Rick Snyder \u2019 s transformation of Michigan into a right-to-work state have put targets on their backs . Send them all to reelection , and conservative chief executives will justifiably take the lesson that such \u201c bold reforms \u201d breed electoral success .\nThe Medicaid expansion : States with close gubernatorial races that still have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act include Alaska , Florida , Georgia , Kansas , Maine and Wisconsin . The Maine Legislature has twice approved expansion , only to see it vetoed by Gov . Paul LePage , so a change there would almost certainly get expansion through . Republican Asa Hutchinson , favored to win the governor \u2019 s race in Arkansas , could decline to maintain his state \u2019 s private insurance option for Medicaid , which he has called \u201c a pilot project that can be ended if needed. \u201d Plus , the potential for Democratic victories in North Carolina , another laboratory for conservative governance , has led Gov . Pat McCrory , who \u2019 s not even on the ballot this year , to consider expansion anyway . So the healthcare of potentially hundreds of thousands of poor Americans is on the line .\nEducation reform : The race for California superintendent of public instruction has become a referendum on the internal Democratic war over public education , pitting pro-labor Tom Torlakson against pro-charter school , anti-tenure Marshall Tuck . Setting the policy trajectory in the nation \u2019 s largest state will help determine the outcome of this fight .\nContra Jonathan Chait , just because stakes are high in the states doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re meaningless in Congress . House Republicans and the president may want many different things , and neither has the votes to cancel the other out . But if , as expected , Republicans take over the Senate , there are discrete areas of alignment .\nCorporate-written trade deals : A New York Times report on White House midterm strategizing lists three areas for potential compromise with Republicans : trade , corporate taxes and infrastructure . The latter two seem like pipe dreams . But the main reason for the relative paucity of trade deals in Obama \u2019 s first six years has been opposition from Democrats , not Republicans . A unified Republican Congress could return \u201c fast-track \u201d trade agreement authority to the president , and support him on deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which is less about \u201c free trade \u201d than creating governmental barriers to regulating multinational corporations . Given that the massive trade deficit is a key factor in our slow economic growth , deals that consolidate corporate power and send more jobs overseas play an indelible role .\nPrivacy rights : Three provisions of the Patriot Act sunset in 2015 , at a precarious time in the post-Snowden era . But a Republican Congress can be expected to extend them . Likewise , establishment Republicans and the White House have similar views on cybersecurity and surveillance , and I would expect them to join hands and pass status quo legislation there . Democrats aren \u2019 t exactly wild-eyed civil libertarians on this , but the absence of Mark Udall , one of the Senate \u2019 s more courageous members on these matters , and a Senate majority that has no need to listen to Ron Wyden , will certainly weaken the trans-partisan coalition against privacy infringement .\nEnergy policy : Where a Republican Congress will have even more clout comes on legislation that must be renewed . The biggest could be the 30 percent tax credit on solar panel installation . Right now , solar is on track to be competitive with or cheaper than fossil fuel-based energy in almost every state by 2016 . But if the tax credit expires that year , the competitiveness becomes more limited , stunting the growth of the most promising technology for reducing the level of carbon in the atmosphere .\nNominations : As has been documented , you can forget about the president getting any judges or even vaguely controversial executive branch appointments confirmed in his final two years in office , if Republicans take the Senate . This includes two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors . If they go unfilled , it gives disproportionate influence to regional bank presidents , who are more inclined to raise interest rates faster amid changing economic conditions . With the Fed carrying much of the short-term economic load , this could lead to premature monetary tightening and weaker growth .\nNational elections set in motion the direction of public policy , and 2014 is no different .\nVoting rights : Seventeen new states have voter ID laws on the books since 2000 . Millions of potential voters in 27 states could be caught up in a massive purge of the voter rolls , a program only caught by Al Jazeera America and picked up by few other outlets . On election night , you \u2019 ll hear pundits bloviate about security moms or some other made-up metric to explain turnout , and will barely mention multiple coordinated techniques to stop people from voting . That all but ensures these voter suppression tactics will continue , a stunning rollback of democracy in a country with no constitutional right to vote .\nThe twilight of activist government : The biggest stakes in this election concern what lessons will be drawn from it . It \u2019 s actually easy to call this a Seinfeldian election about nothing , because Democratic candidates have been so reluctant to stand for anything . They have offered little hope to a public made insecure by stagnant wages , soaring inequality and an economy insufficient to their needs . Implicit in this insecurity is the helplessness so many Americans feel about a political system that doesn \u2019 t seem within their grasp to affect , unless they have a spare billion dollars lying around .\nWhen government fails for whatever reason , the perceived defenders of government suffer . And if those perceived defenders react by running away from any effort to use government levers to improve people \u2019 s lives , we will descend further into a Reagan-era miasma of market fundamentalism and corporate power .",
