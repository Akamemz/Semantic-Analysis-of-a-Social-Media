    "content": "Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday from House Republicans for his handling of the collusion and obstruction investigations into President Trump , as his fiery congressional hearing gave the probe 's detractors a rare chance to confront him .\nAt the same time , the highly anticipated testimony offered little in the way of new revelations . Far from an operatic rendition of the Mueller report that Democrats hoped would paint a clear picture of pernicious misconduct by the president , the testimony resembled more a spoken-word album -- halting , at times awkward , with scant dramatic flair .\nThe result of hours of grueling hearings before two House committees -- like the report itself -- was ambiguous . Mueller at times appeared flustered , often asking lawmakers to repeat questions , while referring back to the report or stating topics were outside his purview whenever questioners sought to drag him outside the bounds of his written findings .\nMueller notably declared Wednesday that , despite Trump 's assertions to the contrary , the report does not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice . Defending his probe , Mueller told House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , \u201c It is not a witch hunt . ''\nAnd in a moment that could keep Democrats digging , Mueller replied , `` yes , '' when Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck on the Judiciary Committee asked if the president could be charged with a crime after he left office . Pressed if the president could be charged with obstruction after he left office , Mueller again replied : \u201c Yes . ''\nStill , Mueller stood by his findings that there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election . Schiff , in the second hearing of the day , charged that Mueller \u2019 s report found that the Trump campaign \u201c welcomed \u201d Russia \u2019 s interference in the election . Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , followed by quipping , `` Welcome everyone to the last gasp of the Russian collusion conspiracy theory . ''\nMuch of the hearing , though , provided a forum for Republicans to fume at Mueller over the way he conducted the other part of his probe , on the obstruction component .\nRepublicans argued prosecutors should only bring charges in such a case -- and would have no business saying whether someone is innocent , in questioning the section of his report stating that while the probe did not establish Trump committed a crime , it also did not exonerate him .\nREPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE\n\u201c Can you give an example other than Donald Trump where the Justice Department determined an investigated person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined ? \u201d Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe asked Mueller .\n\u201c I can not , but this is a unique situation , '' Mueller replied .\nRatcliffe shot back : \u201c The special counsel \u2019 s job didn \u2019 t say you were to determine Trump \u2019 s innocence or to exonerate him. \u201d He added : \u201c Respectfully , it was not the special counsel \u2019 s job to conclusively determine Trump \u2019 s innocence . \u201d\nAnother member of the House Judiciary Committee , Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert , told Mueller he \u201c perpetuated injustice \u201d for spending two years investigating the president . `` What he 's doing is not obstructing justice ; he is pursuing justice , '' he said .\nOhio Rep. Steve Chabot called the report a \u201c one-sided attack \u201d on the president , as he demanded answers about the origins of the Russia probe , claiming anti-Trump bias at the time among top officials of the Justice Department .\nDemocrats -- amid a push from liberals to impeach Trump \u2013 have argued the report proves the president worked to hinder the probe . Under questioning House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , Mueller flatly replied \u201c no \u201d when asked if his report totally exonerates the president , as Trump has argued .\nMUELLER SAYS HE IS 'NOT FAMILIAR ' WITH FUSION GPS , THE FIRM BEHIND THE STEELE DOSSIER\n`` The president was not exculpated , '' Mueller said , also adding that Trump refused to sit for an interview with his investigators .\nMueller 's investigation looked into Trump 's firing of FBI director James Comey , his ousting of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and anti-Mueller comments allegedly made by Trump to then-White House counsel Don McGahn .\n\u201c Although Department policy barred you from indicting the president for this conduct , you made clear that he is not exonerated , \u201d Nadler told Mueller . \u201c Any other person who acted this way would have been charged with a crime . And in this nation , not even the president is above the law . \u201d\nIn an attempt to prove obstruction , Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings asked Mueller about the president 's responses to questions from his team , asking , \u201c Isn \u2019 t it fair to say the president \u2019 s written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete because he didn \u2019 t answer many of your questions , but where he did , his answers showed that he wasn \u2019 t always being truthful ? \u201d\nRepublicans pushed back on the obstruction accusation , repeatedly arguing Trump was not guilty of the underlying offense of coordination with Russia during the 2016 election . House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins , R-Ga. , asked Mueller if his probe was \u201c curtailed or stopped or hindered \u201d at any point . Mueller replied , \u201c no . \u201d\nMueller said at the outset of the hearing he wouldn \u2019 t discuss the origins of the FBI 's investigation into the president , saying he won \u2019 t be \u201c able to answer questions about certain areas that I know are of public interest. \u201d Pressed by Republicans about the anti-Trump dossier paid for by Democrats , authored by ex-British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by firm Fusion GPS , Mueller repeatedly refused to discuss the issue , saying , \u201c This is outside my purview . \u201d\nThe dossier of claims about Trump 's relationship with Russia was provided to the Justice Department at the early stages of the investigation . Republicans have demanded answers about the origins of the Russia probe , claiming anti-Trump bias at the time among top officials of the Justice Department .\nHe also repeatedly declined to answer questions about Joseph Mifsud , the mysterious Maltese professor believed to have played a key role in igniting the Russia probe . Investigators say he was the one who told then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had \u201c dirt \u201d that could damage Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign . Mueller 's report said Mifsud told the FBI inaccurate information . \u201c I can \u2019 t get into it , \u201d Mueller said .\nMueller acknowledged , under questioning from Republicans , being friends with former FBI director James Comey . He also addressed anti-Trump texts sent by then-FBI agent Peter Strzok , saying he moved to `` swiftly '' reassign Strzok from the probe when he learned of them . He fired back at a Republican lawmaker who questioned the Democratic ties to some on his team , saying , `` I 've been in this business for almost 25 years , and in those 25 years , I have not had occasion once to ask somebody about their political affiliation . It is not done . ''\nMueller affirmed his finding of no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election\n\u201c The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities , \u201d Mueller said . \u201c We did not address \u2018 collusion , \u2019 which is not a legal term . Rather , we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy . It was not . \u201d\n\u201c We found insufficient evidence of the president \u2019 s culpability , \u201d Mueller added .\nMueller started his day with testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , before heading for more questioning in front of the House Intelligence Committee , where Democrats had high hopes for the hearings . On Capitol Hill , the hearing on Wednesday drew a large crowd of spectators , including anti-Trump activists .\n\u201c I wanted to watch history unfold , \u201d said Alethea Shapiro of New York . \u201c Hopefully nailing the coffin nailing Trump \u2019 s coffin shut finally once and for all . Collusion , obstruction , crimes . ''\nBut in between hearings , White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted : `` The last three hours have been an epic embarrassment for the Democrats . Expect more of the same in the second half . ''\nThe president has repeatedly decried Mueller \u2019 s probe as a \u201c witch hunt , \u201d emphatically denying he or his campaign colluded with Russia to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2019 s chances in the 2016 race , or that he worked to obstruct the investigation . In the hours before the hearing , the president fired off a spate of tweets accusing Mueller of being conflicted and protesting his request for Aaron Zebley , his top aide on the probe , to join him at the witness table Wednesday .\n\u201c So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers , \u201d Trump tweeted . \u201c What \u2019 s this all about ? His lawyer represented the \u201c basement server guy \u201d who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case . This should NOT be allowed . Rigged Witch Hunt ! \u201d\nNunes , at the beginning of the Intelligence Committee hearing , also protested Zebley \u2019 s appearance , saying Republican members wouldn \u2019 t ask him questions . Schiff countered that it was fine for Zebley to appear , saying Trump \u2013 the `` angry man down the street '' \u2013 must not have wanted him there .\nEarlier this week , the Justice Department sent Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers `` within the boundaries '' of the public version of his report . The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday \u2019 s hearing , with Nadler calling it \u201c incredibly arrogant. \u201d But Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Mueller \u2019 s team who asked for guidance ahead of the hearing .\nMueller submitted his report to the Justice Department in March ; a redacted version was later released to the public in April .\nMueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation : in May , Mueller made clear his disinterest in testifying before lawmakers , saying , \u201c Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report .
