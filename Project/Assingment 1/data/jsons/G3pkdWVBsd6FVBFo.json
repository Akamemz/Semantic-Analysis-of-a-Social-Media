Icahn had suggested .\nOnly six months earlier , eBay had rejected Mr. Icahn \u2019 s call to spin off PayPal , the payment processor , which generated nearly half of the overall company \u2019 s revenue . At the time , management insisted that keeping the company together made more sense .\nBut after months of long discussions about where the e-commerce industry was headed \u2014 the emergence of new payment standards ; the rise of cardless payment systems for services like Uber ; the hotly anticipated market debut of the Alibaba Group \u2014 John J.

On Tuesday , the company announced that PayPal would be spun off as a separate publicly traded company , letting each of eBay \u2019 s two main businesses chart its own course while maintaining most of their important business ties .\nThe spinoff , set to be completed in the second half of next year , is one of the biggest changes in the nearly 20-year history of eBay , in a single stroke reducing the company largely to its enormous online marketplaces . And it makes PayPal , which has grown tremendously since eBay bought it in 2002 , an independent company free to pursue its own strategy .\nInvestors applauded the move , pushing eBay \u2019 s shares up 7.5 percent on Tuesday , to $ 56.63 .\nThe breakup of eBay is among the most prominent in corporate America this year , as companies have looked to simplify their businesses in hopes of appeasing shareholders hungry for ways to bolster stock prices . Spinoffs have been especially popular among activist shareholders , who buy stakes in companies and call for changes .\nBut the decision was especially notable given eBay \u2019 s full-throated defense against the often vitriolic assault by Mr. Icahn , who called eBay among the worst-run companies he had ever seen and described Mr. Donahoe as \u201c either incompetent or negligent. \u201d On Tuesday , even Mr. Icahn , a longtime corporate raider , seemed surprised by the apparent change of heart , writing on his corporate blog , \u201c We are happy that eBay \u2019 s board and management have acted responsibly concerning the separation \u2014 perhaps a little later than they should have , but earlier than we expected . \u201d\nYet Mr. Donahoe and other company representatives insisted that eBay had kept an open mind about the possibility of spinning off PayPal for some time .
