I may have interviewed Bill Clinton more than any other reporter during his eight years in the White House , but I had zero sit-downs alone with his wife . When she was persuaded to do interviews with the president at her side , she was so careful with her words that she seemed to have no personality .\nShe was designed for an earlier era in politics . Back when her husband was running , Mrs. Clinton always seemed relieved when the interview was over and only then came to life \u2014 even waiting on me and cleaning up after my lunch on their campaign bus . She has been dissected , autopsied and minced for decades . It \u2019 s still a challenge for her to demonstrate emotion publicly . She is better with people who have no power : Her empathy for children , for the abused , for the damaged is palpable . She is less good at dealing with the things that really should not matter .\nEven now she appears to imagine that even more people are out to get her than actually are , which is saying something . But in a way she \u2019 s right to feel the way she does . People are out to know her , in a way that she probably never imagined she would need to be known .
