    "content": "The US Senate has confirmed William Barr as attorney general , puttingthe longtime lawyer atop the Justice Department and putting him in charge of overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's long-running probe of whether President Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia .\nTrump announced he would nominate Barr , 68 , in December 2018 , after Jeff Sessions resigned at Trump 's request in November .\nThe Senate voted 54 to 45 , largely along party lines . A Justice Department spokeswoman said Barr will be sworn in on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office of the White House by Chief Justice John Roberts .\nMany Democrats opposed Barr out of concern he might not make Mueller 's findings fully public . But the Senate is controlled by Trump 's fellow Republicans , so Barr 's confirmation was virtually assured .\n`` Today is a great day for the Department of Justice with the confirmation of William Barr to be the next Attorney General , '' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham .\n`` He is a steady hand at a time of turmoil and he will bring much-needed reform to the Department of Justice . ''\nHe previously held the position under George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993 .\nBefore that , he briefly served in the CIA in the early 1970s and served as domestic policy staff from 1982 to 1983 , while Republican Ronald Reagan was president .\nSo , where does Barr stand on some of the most important issues in the United States ?\nDuring a Senate hearing on Tuesday , Democratic Senator Corey Booker questioned Barr about his past claims that there is `` no statistical evidence '' of racial disparity in the US criminal justice system .\nAlthough Barr backtracked on those comments , Booker pointed out that Barr , as attorney general in 1992 , signed off on a report titled The Case for More Incarceration .\nDuring a 1992 interview , Barr also said he did not believe the US justice system treats `` people differently '' based on their race .\n`` That is , if a black and a white are charged with the same offence , generally they will get the same treatment in the system , and ultimately the same penalty , '' Barr said at the time .\nDecades of studies , however , have generally agreed that African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned in the US .\nAt the end of Booker and Barr 's exchange this week , the nominee admitted that African Americans are jailed at inflated rates , but suggested that , `` I think the reduction in crime has [ benefit the black community ] since 1992 , but I think that the heavy drug penalties , especially on crack and other things , have harmed the black community , the incarceration rates . ''\nSince coming to office , Trump has launched repeated attacks on the press at large and many journalists , describing media as `` the enemy of the people '' .\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared willing to put some of Trump 's views on the press into practice by suggesting that the Department of Justice would increase its efforts to track down leakers and whistleblowers .\nSessions had also talked of readjusting rules for issuing subpoenas to journalists .\nWhile pressed on the issue of media freedom on Tuesday , Barr did not appear to present a radical break from Sessions or Trump .\n`` If you 're confirmed , will the Justice Department jail reporters for doing their jobs ? '' Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar asked .\nBarr replied by saying jailing journalists would be a `` last resort '' .\n`` I know there are guidelines in place , and I can conceive of situations where , as a last resort , '' Barr replied , `` and where a news organisation has run through a red flag or something like that , knows that they 're putting out stuff that will hurt the country , there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt . ''\nBarr 's hardline record on immigration differs little from the Trump administration 's anti-immigration agenda .\nOn Tuesday , Barr defended Trump 's call for a wall on the US-Mexico border , an issue that led to a partial government shutdown , now in its 26th day .\nBarr also condemned sanctuary cities , baselessly claiming that they encouraged migrants to travel to the US .\nArguing that most asylum seekers fail to obtain that status , Barr said it would be better to block them from entering the country at all .\nDuring his tenure as attorney general under George HW Bush , Barr oversaw an effort to strictly enforce immigration restrictions .\nIf confirmed , Barr could become an important ally for Trump at a time when he seeks to radically decrease immigration and erect a wall on the US-Mexico border .\nBarr also expressed his support for Trump 's attempts to ban travellers for several Muslim-majority countries .\nIf confirmed , Barr would be in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between Moscow and Trump 's campaign .\nTrump frequently criticises the Mueller probe as a `` witch-hunt '' and has denied any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice . Russia has denied US intelligence agencies ' findings that it interfered in the 2016 election .\nDuring his confirmation hearings , Barr said that on his watch , `` Bob will be allowed to complete his work . ''\nDemocrats worry that Trump 's administration may try to undercut the investigation .\nBarr said he does n't believe Mueller `` would be involved in a witch-hunt '' , adding that it was `` unimaginable '' that the special counsel would do anything in the investigation that would justify reeling it in or shutting it down .\nBarr said he agreed with Mueller 's charge that Russian entities interfered in the election , or at least tried to do so . He said he described Mueller , a longtime friend , as a `` straight shooter '' when Trump asked about him .\nMueller is due to submit a final report to the attorney general , prompting concern from some Democrats that the Trump administration will try to quash his findings .
