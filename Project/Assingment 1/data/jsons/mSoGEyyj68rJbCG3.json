In the ruling , the Ninth U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed the limits on a president \u2019 s powers , sweeping aside the government \u2019 s argument that Mr. Trump \u2019 s authority when it comes to immigration is \u201c unreviewable \u201d by the courts .\nPeter Edelman , a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center , said about the court \u2019 s decision : \u201c This is a marker .
