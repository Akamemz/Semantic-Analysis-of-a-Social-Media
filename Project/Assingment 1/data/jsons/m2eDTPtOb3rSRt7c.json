Gore , which decided the 2000 U.S. presidential contest , the high court on Thursday let stand , in a 5-4 decision , the centerpiece of President Obama 's health care legislation .\nChief Justice John Roberts , providing the deciding vote and writing the majority opinion , laid out the rationale , which says that Congress under the Commerce Clause does not have the authority to require people to buy insurance \u2014 but it does have the authority to tax people who do not have coverage .\nThe so-called individual mandate embedded in the health care legislation , Roberts wrote , `` must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do not have health insurance , if such a construction is reasonable . ''\nHe and four other justices from the more liberal wing of the court concluded that Congress , under its power to `` lay and collect taxes , '' created a reasonable tax .\nRoberts , delivering the opinion of the court , said that though the health care legislation language describes that `` shared responsibility payment '' as a `` penalty '' and not a tax , the `` label is not fatal , '' and the `` shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax . ''\nThe court also narrowed Congress 's ability to require states to expand their Medicaid coverage for low-income people .\nFor legal analysis on this blockbuster decision , we turned to prominent scholars and lawyers on both sides of the issue :\nAssociate dean for faculty research and professor of law and political science at the University of Notre Dame and a former law clerk for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist .\n`` The decision is complicated and interesting . Chief Justice Roberts ' opinion opens with a five-page summary of basic , fundamental principles of constitutional law and the limits of power in a decision that , at the end of the day , upholds this sprawling , landmark federal law . It also found that Congress 's power is limited , and courts can enforce those limits . `` The key to the mandate 's survival appears to be that people who do n't comply with the mandate still pay a fine . Existence of the pay-a-fine option permits the government to say that it functions like a tax , and so it 's permissible . If the court had regarded this policy as a mandate , period , it appears that a majority would have thought it was unconstitutional . It 's a mandate with an escape hatch , the court says , so it 's permissible . `` For people like me , interested in Federalism and judicial review of federal power , the decision had a lot of emphasis of how the Commerce Clause does have limits . The Medicaid expansion decision puts teeth into the notion that the federal government ca n't coerce states . At the end of the day , the act is upheld , and that 's a win for the administration .
