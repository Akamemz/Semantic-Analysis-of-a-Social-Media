    "content": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders is best known to the American public for running the White House daily briefing , a televised performance in which , without so much as raising her voice , the president \u2019 s press secretary manages to deflect questions , flatly contradict facts and generally throw wet blankets over the countless fires burning around the administration of Donald Trump . But the most Sandersesque moment yet may be one that happened away from the West Wing , at a little-publicized February event in downtown Washington . She was appearing alongside Mike McCurry , who had held the same position under Bill Clinton , on a panel about the job . McCurry was letting her have it .\n\u201c You have got to have an administration that \u2019 s committed to respect the role of the free press , \u201d McCurry said . \u201c You can not have a president who declares them to be the enemy and goes out and describes them as fake news every day . \u201d\nTrump has grown to trust and like Sanders , according to multiple accounts from inside the White House , thanks in no small part to her unwavering , relentless advocacy on his behalf . But on this evening , she was not spoiling for a fight . She tried to defuse McCurry with one of her go-to jokes\u2014 \u201c I \u2019 m used to not always being the most popular person in the room \u201d \u2014and nodded politely while he continued to rail at the administration .\n\u201c You can not do this job in an environment in which you are belligerent and saying you \u2019 re at war with these people every day , \u201d McCurry told her .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever said anything similar to that , \u201d Sanders replied .\nMcCurry kept going : Her boss \u2019 war on the media was threatening the glue that holds our democracy together .\nFinally , Sanders had had enough . \u201c We have not declared war on the press , \u201d she said . She smiled at the apparent ridiculousness of the idea , and even let out a chuckle .\nA murmur spread throughout the small crowd . The event was sponsored by the White House Correspondents \u2019 Association and filled with reporters who had been living through that very war . Her boss had called them the \u201c enemy of the American people \u201d and used Twitter to attack individual journalists by name . For more than a year , he had waged a campaign against the news media more openly hostile than any president in history . And Sanders had been his point person . From her podium , she had promoted the \u201c fake news awards , \u201d accused reporters of \u201c purposefully misleading the American people \u201d and , just a week earlier , claimed that the media was endangering national security by reporting leaked information . Here , in one moment , she hadn \u2019 t just dismissed McCurry \u2019 s accusation , but conjured an entire alternate reality .\nThat , according to a former Trump administration official I spoke with , is exactly why the president loves her . \u201c That \u2019 s what Trump means , \u2018 She \u2019 s got a great way about her , \u2019 \u201d the former official says . \u201c When she says something , it \u2019 s totally sincere . It can be crazy , but it \u2019 s totally sincere . \u201d\nLike much else in the Trump era , the Sarah Huckabee Sanders show is unlike anything Washington has ever seen .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t really recognize the job anymore , \u201d says Jay Carney , who served as press secretary under President Barack Obama .\n\u201c It feels totally different to me , \u201d says Ari Fleischer , who held the post under President George W. Bush .\nMost press secretaries have served as hype men for their bosses , arguing a case that , as one former press secretary put it , ideally builds from briefing to briefing , week to week , and year to year . That is not what Sanders does . This administration doesn \u2019 t build cases over time ; it just tries to survive the day . Amid a constant drumbeat of surprise and scandal , she is there to beat back the press and squelch its enthusiasm .\nAnd she is very , very good at it . Sanders possesses a unique talent that , heretofore , has not quite been considered a talent : She can deaden a room . You almost have to be in the White House briefing room , a claustrophobic space packed tight with reporters and photographers , to appreciate her art . When the bright lights are on and the cameras are snapping and everyone is yelling , \u201c Sarah ! Sarah ! \u201d with their hands in the air , a palpable electricity flows through it . The moment Sanders unleashes her trademark monotone , the energy drains .\nThe way several current and former officials put it : Sarah Huckabee Sanders keeps the president from flipping out every day .\nTrump is , of course , obsessed with television , and he manages no part of the government as obsessively as he manages his own image on the screen . The anxious , combative performances of his first press secretary , Sean Spicer , tended to raise Trump \u2019 s own anxiety levels . But Sanders is different , and she matters right now more than you might think a press secretary could . The way several current and former officials put it : Sanders keeps the president from flipping out every day .\n\u201c It \u2019 s crucial , \u201d one former administration official says . \u201c Vitally important , \u201d another former official says , adding , \u201c I don \u2019 t think she \u2019 s replaceable . I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s another one out there like her . \u201d\nAnd her role is growing . After communications director and Trump confidante Hope Hicks announced in February that she would be leaving the White House , Sanders was asked to add the communications job to her current duties , according to a White House official and another source familiar with the situation . Sanders stayed put , but she is expected to step into Hicks \u2019 shoes in another sense , taking on some portion of her role advising and supporting a volatile president .\nThe public hasn \u2019 t always been kind to Sanders , who gets caricatured as a sour , irritable figure in cartoons and has become a lightning rod for public frustration with the Trump administration \u2019 s vexed relationship with facts . But those who have known her for years see a different person : They swear by her as loyal , professional , charming and witty . She manages to keep up with former colleagues spanning years and , in a rare instance of Washington collegiality , remains close with the person whose job she took , Spicer . Some reporters even cop behind the scenes to liking her . So how does that person transform into someone so different during briefings , a kind of denier-in-chief at a critical moment for American democracy ?\nIt all has to do with her relationship with her one-person audience , and what the role of press secretary has become under him . And the secret to that lies in just how she got to the White House in the first place .\nTo truly appreciate Sarah Huckabee Sanders , you first must appreciate what the job did to Sean Spicer . A longtime political trench fighter and Republican National Committee veteran , he combusted under the pressure of delivering Trump \u2019 s message . The job required him to lie , his answers were picked apart , and he got caught up in the infighting of the early Trump White House . \u201c There used to be a process that everything followed , and I think that rulebook went out the door , \u201d Spicer says . Everything in the Trump White House , he says , was harder . \u201c You pick the variable , it \u2019 s times 10 . \u201d\nSanders did not come from Washington , or from institutional politics at all\u2014she spent years learning from a very different rulebook . Trump was not the first charismatic , populist conservative she worked for . The other one put her on the job at age 9 .\nIn 1992 , her father , Mike Huckabee , ran his first statewide campaign , as a Republican for U.S. Senate from Arkansas . \u201c From the time she was in elementary school , she saw politics up close and personal , \u201d Huckabee says . \u201c She was involved in it , everything from going with me to campaign on weekends and passing out fliers at county fairs . \u201d\nThe pastor-turned-candidate would hand his daughter $ 5 and a stack of fliers , and tell her that once all the fliers were gone , she could treat herself to some cotton candy or a ride . That first campaign did not go well , but he came back a year later to win a special election for lieutenant governor , and then the year after that to defend his seat . It marked his third statewide campaign in three years . Sarah was 11 . \u201c She was always wanting to be in the room , \u201d Huckabee recalls . \u201c I can remember her standing around the kitchen table listening to Dick Morris explain crosstabs . \u201d\nThe Family Business Sanders \u2019 formative experience was her father \u2019 s 2008 campaign for president , a family-centered endeavor not unlike the one she would join eight years later : the Trump White House . | Al Drago/Redux ; Michael Stravato/Redux\nSanders wasn \u2019 t shielded from the unpleasant side of the business . \u201c Arkansas politics were pretty brutal , \u201d Huckabee says , recounting the personal attacks he faced in a still-Democratic state that had recently been governed by Bill Clinton . And then , there was the glare of the press . When the teenage Sarah got in a car crash , it made the papers . Huckabee , who would go on to serve as governor for a decade , thought the broadcast media was fair , but , in his view , \u201c the print press in Arkansas were pretty slanted , and for the most part overwhelmingly pro-Democrat . \u201d\nAs her friend Leslie Rutledge , a former Huckabee staffer who is now Arkansas attorney general , put it , \u201c She lived a press briefing every single day as a child . \u201d\nWhatever came , the family rallied around the patriarch , and Sarah walked closely in his footsteps . In high school at Little Rock Central , she joined the mock trial and debate clubs , and was named secretary of the Arkansas Federation of Teenage Republicans . \u201c We chose her because she was capable , \u201d one member said at the time . \u201c It just so happens that she \u2019 s also the governor \u2019 s daughter. \u201d Then she attended his alma mater , Ouachita Baptist University , in Arkadelphia , Arkansas , and , while there , worked on his 2002 reelection campaign as a field coordinator . That year , spurred on by her dad , she also enlisted as the lead plaintiff in a voting rights case . An area judge had stripped college students of their right to vote in local elections , and Sanders signed on with the ACLU to fight the ruling . They won , freeing hundreds of students on the conservative Christian campus to vote for Mike Huckabee .\nIn another person , such a record might seem transparently ambitious . But that \u2019 s not what Sanders was like , says her former political science professor , Hal Bass . \u201c She was a delight to be with , she was fun . \u2026 She smiled , she was witty , \u201d Bass says . \u201c I think you don \u2019 t see a lot of that in her public persona now . \u201d\nSanders \u2019 truly formative experience was her dad \u2019 s 2008 campaign for president , a family-centered endeavor not unlike the one Sanders would join eight years later . After working for George W. Bush after college , she returned as her father \u2019 s national political director , planting herself in Iowa to lead the campaign \u2019 s efforts there . Former Huckabee colleagues remember her willingness to perform any task , pull all-nighters and speak frankly with her father . Through long days and late nights and bull sessions at P.F . Chang \u2019 s , she grew close to several staffers , including a volunteer named Bryan Sanders , who would be hired full-time and later become her husband .\nDuring the primaries , Huckabee , the bass guitar-playing former governor who had lost more than 100 pounds and run a marathon , emerged as something of a media darling . But members of the campaign , including his daughter , quickly grew frustrated with the cartoon pastor they believed was being portrayed on TV . \u201c We were the original \u2018 They \u2019 re not treating us fair \u2019 group , \u201d says Chip Saltsman , Huckabee \u2019 s 2008 campaign manager .\nHuckabee surged to an upset win in Iowa , but by March was swamped by John McCain and out of the race . As her dad \u2019 s point person in Iowa , though , Sanders had a real win under her belt , something that could have helped punch her ticket in national politics . Instead , she decided to run her dad \u2019 s PAC , aimed at supporting candidates who aligned with his views . Sanders would take on other clients : She ran John Boozman \u2019 s successful 2010 campaign for U.S. Senate from Arkansas , and briefly worked on Tim Pawlenty \u2019 s doomed 2012 run for president . But when her dad decided to throw his hat in the ring for 2016 , she signed on as his campaign manager . It gave her a front-row seat to the hurricane about to hit the Republican Party .\nMike Huckabee was standing backstage on July 18 , 2015 , at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames , Iowa , when candidate Donald Trump made his feelings known about John McCain . \u201c He \u2019 s not a war hero . He is a war hero because he was captured , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I like people that weren \u2019 t captured , OK ? \u201d\nThe former Arkansas governor remembers a Trump staffer standing next to him turning and saying , \u201c Well , I think I may have the shortest tenure of any political consultant. \u201d But Huckabee had a different take . \u201c I was watching and listening to the crowd and how they reacted , and I thought , \u2018 Mmm , boy , \u2019 \u201d Huckabee says .\nHis daughter \u2019 s read was similar . When Huckabee dropped out of the race after pulling only 1.8 percent of the vote in Iowa , Sanders needed a new political home . Surveying the field , she wondered , who had the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton ? \u201c Sarah is from Arkansas , you have to remember , \u201d says her husband , Bryan Sanders . \u201c And she \u2019 s grown up her whole life with the Clintons . \u201d\n\u201c That was the driving force , \u201d he says . \u201c That we have to do everything in our power to defeat Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nShe liked Trump \u2019 s chances , as well as his message , her husband says . \u201c Her dad and Trump were saying a lot of the same things , \u201d Bryan Sanders says . \u201c They were talking about how Washington needs a big change . They were both running very anti-establishment campaigns . \u201d\nIn other ways , though , Trump could not have been more different from her father . Huckabee is a man of God who raised his children to be deeply Christian ; Trump lived like he had a giant Bingo card of sins and was trying to check off every box . Bryan Sanders says his wife \u2019 s faith is \u201c the defining aspect of her life , \u201d which actually made Trump more appealing to her . She liked what he was saying about abortion and religious liberty , as well as the types of judges he was promising to appoint , including to the Supreme Court . \u201c It \u2019 s not hard to see why evangelicals supported him , \u201d her husband says .\nAs for Trump \u2019 s personal flaws ? \u201c Nobody who ever held office is sin-free , \u201d Mike Huckabee says . \u201c Part of it is she understands that the nature of human life is that everyone is a sinner. \u201d To explain , he brings up the German industrialist Oskar Schindler\u2014 \u201c a scoundrel , he was really a terrible person \u201d \u2014who also risked his livelihood to save hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust . ( When I stopped , and asked Huckabee whether he was really making a comparison between Donald Trump and Oskar Schindler , Huckabee said , \u201c No , not necessarily . I mean it could be , but it \u2019 s just a bigger principle . \u201d )\nOn the Job Artwork by Sanders \u2019 children hangs in her office , and a copy of Gone With the Wind sits on a bookshelf . | Evan Vucci/AP\nSo Sanders signed on with Trump . With her Christian bona fides and steady demeanor , she quickly became one of the campaign \u2019 s most reliable surrogates . \u201c When we deployed her , we deployed her under challenging conditions , \u201d says Bryan Lanza , who managed surrogates for the Trump campaign . \u201c She \u2019 s a professional operative , and , in this business , and especially in Trumpworld , there were very few of those . \u201d\nTrump took notice . \u201c Watching her on TV during the campaign , he was really impressed with her , \u201d Hicks says . Trump would ask Hicks for Sanders \u2019 phone number so he could compliment her performance , or he would instruct Hicks to email her on his behalf . \u201c He would always comment on how unflappable she was , how articulate she was , how insightful she was , \u201d Hicks says , \u201c and just really tough in those sometimes challenging circumstances . \u201d\nTwo days after the emergence of the famed \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape in which Trump boasted of grabbing women 's genitals , it was Sanders who went on CNN with Jake Tapper to vouch for her candidate . She condemned Trump \u2019 s words but said the Christian thing to do would be to accept his apology . \u201c Both of these candidates are flawed , \u201d she told Tapper . \u201c There is no perfect person. \u201d When Tapper pressed her on whether Trump would apologize to any women he had , in fact , grabbed , Sanders executed a perfect Trump campaign parry : \u201c Has Hillary Clinton apologized to the four American lives that were lost in Benghazi ? \u201d\nIn Trumpworld , \u201c Billy Bush weekend \u201d was seen as a dividing line : If you were in , you were really in , and if you were out , it would be impossible to ever truly recover with Trump . Sanders was in .\nOfficially hired as Spicer \u2019 s deputy a day before Trump took office , she received her first chance to brief the press in May 2017 , while Spicer was away on Naval Reserve duty . Before that , she had worked only as a political tactician\u2014never in PR\u2014and , watching her early briefings , one former administration official worried that her downhome delivery was not polished enough for Trump . \u201c I was sitting there going , 'Trump \u2019 s head has got to be blowing up , ' \u201d the former official says . \u201c And he loved it. \u201d Trump just kept saying , \u201c She \u2019 s got a way about her , \u201d and \u201c She \u2019 s really solid. \u201d He also has said that she is \u201c smart like her father . \u201d\n\u201c Tough but relatable , that \u2019 s how he has described her to me , and I agree , \u201d White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says .\nOver the ensuing weeks , Trump started pushing for Sanders to do more briefings . With speculation over Spicer \u2019 s fate running rampant , Sanders and her husband discussed what she would say if Trump were to offer her the job of press secretary . Finally , on July 21 , Spicer resigned . At the time , Bryan Sanders and their three children were on vacation with his family at Acadia National Park in Maine ; she had cut her vacation short and returned to Washington . He was hiking in the woods with the kids when he got a text . It said , \u201c I \u2019 m the next press secretary . \u201d\nSanders immediately brought a sense of order to a press shop that had been under siege , and she dialed down the temperature in the briefing room . One White House reporter assessed the transition from Spicer behind the podium to Sanders like this : \u201c She \u2019 s a calm , competent professional . She may lie , but she \u2019 s just a lot more unflappable and calm when she \u2019 s doing it . \u201d\n\u201c She doesn \u2019 t seem to have the angst that he had about it , \u201d the reporter added .\nSanders has developed a number of signature moves at the podium . She \u2019 ll call a question \u201c inappropriate , \u201d or deflect with a joke , sometimes about her kids . She \u2019 ll say she doesn \u2019 t know an answer and needs to find out , or that she simply hasn \u2019 t had the occasion to speak with the president on the matter . Often , she \u2019 ll start a briefing late so that it runs short , or bring in another official to kill time . But reporters grow most infuriated when she flatly backs up the president when everyone in the room knows he \u2019 s wrong . Behold this exchange from October 10 between Trey Yingst , a reporter for the conservative-friendly One America News , and Sanders :\nThe Play for Time Reading a letter from a Trump supporter .\nThe Guest Appearance Full-Body Feint Bringing out another administration official to talk before the briefing begins .\nThe Joke Jab and Grab \u201c The president was clearly joking . \u201d\nThe Briefing Bob-and-Weave \u201c I haven \u2019 t spoken with him about it , so I \u2019 d have to get back to you . \u201d\nThe Saved by the Bell \u201c Arriving late to the briefing and leaving early for unspecified appointments. \u201d llustrations by Patrick Welsh\nYINGST : The president repeated this claim in the Oval Office today , saying we \u2019 re the highest-taxed nation in the world . Why does the president keep saying this ? It \u2019 s not true , overall .\nSANDERS : We are the highest-taxed\u2014corporate tax in the developed economy . That \u2019 s a fact .\nSANDERS : That \u2019 s what he \u2019 s talking about . We are the highest corporate-taxed country in the developed economies across the globe .\nYINGST : Sarah , so that \u2019 s accurate , but the president keeps repeating this claim that we \u2019 re the highest-taxed nation in the world .\nYINGST : But that \u2019 s not what he said . He said we \u2019 re the highest-taxed nation in the world .\nSANDERS : The highest-taxed corporate nation . It seems pretty consistent to me . Sorry , we \u2019 re just going to have to agree to disagree .\nSome reporters will outright call Sanders a liar . Others are more reluctant to break out the L-word but still become frustrated at the way she regularly obfuscates and bends the truth . Whereas Spicer was known for big blowups , reporters say that with Sanders it feels more like a million small things . \u201c There \u2019 s almost sometimes an exhaustion writing the stories of the daily briefing because the number of things she says that are patently false are too many to let your story be weighed down with them , \u201d one White House reporter says .\nHere is a highly incomplete list of Sanders \u2019 misadventures with the truth :\nAugust 2 , 2017 : Said Trump didn \u2019 t lie when he claimed the Mexican president called to praise his immigration policies , or when he said leaders from the Boy Scouts of America called to praise a speech he gave at the National Scout Jamboree . ( Neither call had occurred . )\nNovember 1 , 2017 : Said immigrants entering the United States on diversity visas aren \u2019 t vetted . ( They are . )\nNovember 2 , 2017 : Denied that Trump called the U.S. justice system \u201c a joke. \u201d ( Hours earlier , Trump said of the justice system , \u201c What we have right now , it \u2019 s a joke and it \u2019 s a laughingstock . \u201d )\nFebruary 20 , 2018 : Said , \u201c The president hasn \u2019 t said that Russia didn \u2019 t meddle. \u201d ( He has . )\nMarch 27 , 2018 : Said there has been a citizenship question \u201c included in every census since 1965 , with the exception of 2010 , when it was removed. \u201d ( No citizenship question has appeared on the full census form since 1950 . )\nSanders declined to comment for this article . But both her husband and father say that any characterization of her as a liar is unfair . \u201c All I know is that Sarah is never going to do anything that violates her conscience , \u201d Bryan Sanders says . \u201c She \u2019 s never been asked to do something that violates her conscience . \u201d\nBy blowing up his credibility live on TV , Spicer appears to have sacrificed the type of juicy book deal or sweet corporate gig that usually greets press secretaries on the other side of the job . But Sanders appears unconcerned with that . Those around her say she has never been one to look ahead , instead always focusing on the job at hand and , as she has since she was 9 , loyally fighting for the person she works for .\n\u201c Sarah and her father are like Ivanka and her father , \u201d Conway says . \u201c They \u2019 re very close , and the daughters came into the family business . There \u2019 s a similarity . \u201d\nWhatever the cost to her credibility , there \u2019 s no question Sanders \u2019 stature in the White House has grown . She has become one of the few people able to actually talk with the president , and even move his position , multiple officials say . They speak before most briefings , and while she can be direct , one senior administration official describes the particularly deft way Sanders has developed of pushing back on Trump . Typically , she does not bluntly disagree with him , but walks him through how the press might react to something . For instance , the official says , if Sanders objects to a strategy Trump has suggested , she might say , \u201c Well , here \u2019 s what the follow-up question on that issue is going to be , so how would we answer that ? \u201d It \u2019 s a tactic that allows her to redirect the president without having to directly tell him he \u2019 s wrong .\nAnd she has another skill particularly valuable when working for a boss who doesn \u2019 t always operate according to a plan . When issues come up that Trump has not yet addressed , Sanders is adept at channeling his thinking , according to Conway . \u201c Sarah is really deft about speaking for the president on matters [ where ] he has not yet done so , \u201d she says .\n\u201c She gets it . You can \u2019 t have these jobs unless you really understand the principal , and she does , \u201d Conway says . \u201c He respects her , and when she disagrees with him or has questions , it \u2019 s always phrased in a respectful manner . The tough person you see on TV is the tough person here as well . \u201d\nAccording to Hicks , \u201c Their relationship has gotten a lot stronger since she officially took over the podium. \u201d In addition to their time together in the White House , the president calls Sanders frequently at home .\nSarah and her father are like Ivanka and her father . They \u2019 re very close , and the daughters came into the family business . There \u2019 s a similarity . \u201d\nBehind the scenes , Sanders also has come to enjoy a better reputation than you might imagine with White House reporters . When they go to confirm something with her off-camera , she has a reputation for dealing honestly , typically waving them off inaccurate stories and not pushing back on true ones . Some reporters\u2014especially those from smaller outlets\u2014complain that she ignores them and comes off as contemptuous , but others find her to be accessible and understanding of their role . \u201c It \u2019 s different than the show , what you see on TV , \u201d says one , who added that Sanders is often helpful in facilitating logistics .\nSo how does this person square with the one behind the podium ?\nIn the course of reporting this article , I asked more than a dozen of her friends and colleagues what motivates her . The answer was never one issue . \u201c We didn \u2019 t talk a whole lot about policy , \u201d recalls Matt Reisetter , a Huckabee campaign staffer who spent hours with Sanders in Iowa . The picture that emerged is someone driven by the far more elemental force of loyalty .\n\u201c She doesn \u2019 t consider the president an employer , \u201d says Saltsman , the former Huckabee campaign manager , with whom she remains close . \u201c From her point of view , she \u2019 s defending a family member , because that \u2019 s how she \u2019 s always done it . \u201d\nHuckabee agrees . \u201c I think there may be a lot of truth to that , \u201d he says . \u201c She believes her job is to speak for the person who entrusted you. \u201d Speaking for Trump , though , has risks .\nBefore every briefing , Sanders prays and reads from a book of devotions in her office overlooking the White House lawn . Artwork by her children hangs on a board behind her desk , and across the room is a shelf with a few books , including The Christian Life and Character and Gone With the Wind . She \u2019 s the first mother to serve in the job , and nearly everyone who deals with her marvels at her ability to balance work and life .\nSpicer says one of the biggest challenges of the job is how fluid information can be . \u201c When you work for Trump , put your seat belt on and get ready , \u201d he says . \u201c On a daily basis , you \u2019 re trying to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information you have . And the problem is that in a lot of cases , it \u2019 s a constantly evolving issue or process . \u201d\nSometimes issues evolve in world-changing ways . Just after 4 p.m. on March 8 , Sanders was ensconced inside the office with her top deputies , expecting to be tied up in meetings for the rest of the afternoon . That \u2019 s when a staffer burst into her office , telling her that Trump , with Vice President Mike Pence in his wake , had just marched from the Oval Office by her door and was on his way to go speak to the press . Sanders hurried down the hall into the briefing room , where\u2014shocking reporters with his impromptu appearance\u2014Trump said there would be a major announcement at 7 p.m. And then , poof , he was gone .\nAs reporters scrambled to figure out what was going on , Trump \u2019 s press officers seemed as clueless as anyone else . Sanders knew Trump had been meeting with a South Korean delegation , and as they walked from the briefing room back to his residence , he explained to her the rest : He had just accepted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \u2019 s invitation to meet . This was a sudden , radical change in American policy toward a rogue regime , and it sent the military and State Department scrambling . In the next day \u2019 s briefing , Sanders added conditions to the meeting\u2014North Korea had to take concrete steps toward denuclearization\u2014acting as though nothing had changed from the day before . Her newly fabricated reality likely pleased Trump , though the headlines were less kind , focusing on the walk-back .\nThe Korea episode came on the heels of Sanders \u2019 most difficult stretch in the White House . In early February , reports broke that staff secretary Rob Porter \u2019 s ex-wives were accusing him of mental and physical abuse . Sanders was friends with Porter and close with Hicks , whom Porter was then dating . Based on Porter \u2019 s denial , Sanders gave the Daily Mail , which broke the story , a statement supporting him .\nThen pictures showing Porter \u2019 s alleged abuse became public . At that point , the standard PR playbook calls for showing contrition , cutting losses and moving on . But Sanders worked off the Trump playbook , which forbids backing down . She read a statement from Porter at a briefing that referred to the allegations as \u201c a coordinated smear campaign. \u201d She convened a group of four reporters , off the record , to let Porter defend himself in person . Even amid the # MeToo movement , \u201c Early , she gave Rob the benefit of the doubt , \u201d says a person close to the situation .\nAs the White House fumbled , questions about what the administration knew and when mushroomed into bigger stories about why Porter\u2014and then several others , including Jared Kushner , the president \u2019 s son-in-law and adviser\u2014had for so long been allowed to work with interim security clearances .\nIn a February 12 briefing , Sanders said the White House had learned of the extent of the allegations against Porter just six days earlier , and had accepted his resignation \u201c within 24 hours. \u201d The next day , though , FBI Director Christopher Wray directly contradicted her , testifying under oath to Congress that the White House had been made aware of the allegations multiple times , and months earlier .\nSanders was blistered in the press , and grew frustrated at the breakdown in process around her . \u201c Sarah \u2019 s frustration was , you \u2019 re sending me out there and I don \u2019 t have the answers to all of these questions , \u201d says the person close to the situation . \u201c How can you send me out there to answer all these questions when you have not given me the answers ? \u201d\nIn the next briefing , after Wray \u2019 s testimony , Sanders maintained that Wray \u2019 s explanation was compatible with hers , arguing the White House personnel security office was not supposed to share information with other West Wing staffers , but her wording was noticeably cautious . Asked whether anyone in the White House personnel security office\u2014which would have received the reports on Porter from the FBI\u2014communicated with anyone in the West Wing about his clearance , Sanders replied , \u201c I \u2019 m not aware of any communication . I can \u2019 t say definitively , but I \u2019 m not aware of any communication . \u201d\nThe Porter episode wasn \u2019 t just a disaster for Sanders , but for Trump himself . The snowballing scandal ended up costing Kushner and several others their security clearances , and derailed the administration \u2019 s agenda for weeks . Since then , some reporters have noticed Sanders couching her language more carefully at briefings . Phrases like , \u201c to the best of my knowledge \u201d and \u201c as far as I \u2019 m aware \u201d seem more frequent .\nLately , Trump \u2019 s impulsive decisions have also seemed to become ever more frequent . In March , after the Washington Post reported that national security adviser H.R . McMaster was on his way out , Sanders denied any problem , tweeting , \u201c Just spoke to @ POTUS and Gen. H.R . McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC . \u201d\nA week later , McMaster was gone , and the credibility of Sanders\u2014or anyone who purported to speak for Trump\u2014was questioned anew .\nApril Ryan , the American Urban Radio Networks correspondent known for her battles with Sanders , believes the job is taking its toll on her . \u201c The stakes are so high , and people are very angry , \u201d Ryan says , noting that Sanders has been the subject of countless attacks , some related to her job , but also many unfair personal ones . \u201c We \u2019 ve had conversations about our war wounds , \u201d Ryan says . \u201c Anything negative , after a while , it wears on you . \u201d\nHow long will Sanders last ? Rutledge , the Arkansas attorney general and former Huckabee campaign lawyer , says there \u2019 s \u201c always speculation back home in Arkansas whether she would come back and run. \u201d But Bryan Sanders says his wife has no plans to go anywhere anytime soon . \u201c Some days are better than others , \u201d he says , but \u201c she loves her job . \u201d\nOutwardly , Sanders has shown only the smallest signs of cracks\u2014the extra \u201c as far as I know \u201d here or \u201c to the best of my knowledge \u201d there . She has remained loyal . \u201c She goes into the White House every day , and she \u2019 s focused on the day ahead , doing her job to the very best of her abilities every day . She \u2019 s not thinking about what \u2019 s next , \u201d her husband says . \u201c I think it \u2019 s something that her dad \u2019 s always taught her . \u201d\nCORRECTION : This story has been updated to correct the date of Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2019 first press briefing .",
    "content_original": "Jason Schwartz is a media reporter at Politico.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders is best known to the American public for running the White House daily briefing, a televised performance in which, without so much as raising her voice, the president\u2019s press secretary manages to deflect questions, flatly contradict facts and generally throw wet blankets over the countless fires burning around the administration of Donald Trump. But the most Sandersesque moment yet may be one that happened away from the West Wing, at a little-publicized February event in downtown Washington. She was appearing alongside Mike McCurry, who had held the same position under Bill Clinton, on a panel about the job. McCurry was letting her have it.\n\n\u201cYou have got to have an administration that\u2019s committed to respect the role of the free press,\u201d McCurry said. \u201cYou cannot have a president who declares them to be the enemy and goes out and describes them as fake news every day.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump has grown to trust and like Sanders, according to multiple accounts from inside the White House, thanks in no small part to her unwavering, relentless advocacy on his behalf. But on this evening, she was not spoiling for a fight. She tried to defuse McCurry with one of her go-to jokes\u2014\u201cI\u2019m used to not always being the most popular person in the room\u201d\u2014and nodded politely while he continued to rail at the administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot do this job in an environment in which you are belligerent and saying you\u2019re at war with these people every day,\u201d McCurry told her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said anything similar to that,\u201d Sanders replied.\n\nMcCurry kept going: Her boss\u2019 war on the media was threatening the glue that holds our democracy together.\n\nFinally, Sanders had had enough. \u201cWe have not declared war on the press,\u201d she said. She smiled at the apparent ridiculousness of the idea, and even let out a chuckle.\n\nA murmur spread throughout the small crowd. The event was sponsored by the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and filled with reporters who had been living through that very war. Her boss had called them the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d and used Twitter to attack individual journalists by name. For more than a year, he had waged a campaign against the news media more openly hostile than any president in history. And Sanders had been his point person. From her podium, she had promoted the \u201cfake news awards,\u201d accused reporters of \u201cpurposefully misleading the American people\u201d and, just a week earlier, claimed that the media was endangering national security by reporting leaked information. Here, in one moment, she hadn\u2019t just dismissed McCurry\u2019s accusation, but conjured an entire alternate reality.\n\nThat, according to a former Trump administration official I spoke with, is exactly why the president loves her. \u201cThat\u2019s what Trump means, \u2018She\u2019s got a great way about her,\u2019\u201d the former official says. \u201cWhen she says something, it\u2019s totally sincere. It can be crazy, but it\u2019s totally sincere.\u201d\n\nLike much else in the Trump era, the Sarah Huckabee Sanders show is unlike anything Washington has ever seen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really recognize the job anymore,\u201d says Jay Carney, who served as press secretary under President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cIt feels totally different to me,\u201d says Ari Fleischer, who held the post under President George W. Bush.\n\nOlivier Douliery\n\nMost press secretaries have served as hype men for their bosses, arguing a case that, as one former press secretary put it, ideally builds from briefing to briefing, week to week, and year to year. That is not what Sanders does. This administration doesn\u2019t build cases over time; it just tries to survive the day. Amid a constant drumbeat of surprise and scandal, she is there to beat back the press and squelch its enthusiasm.\n\nAnd she is very, very good at it. Sanders possesses a unique talent that, heretofore, has not quite been considered a talent: She can deaden a room. You almost have to be in the White House briefing room, a claustrophobic space packed tight with reporters and photographers, to appreciate her art. When the bright lights are on and the cameras are snapping and everyone is yelling, \u201cSarah! Sarah!\u201d with their hands in the air, a palpable electricity flows through it. The moment Sanders unleashes her trademark monotone, the energy drains.\n\nThe way several current and former officials put it: Sarah Huckabee Sanders keeps the president from flipping out every day.\n\nTrump is, of course, obsessed with television, and he manages no part of the government as obsessively as he manages his own image on the screen. The anxious, combative performances of his first press secretary, Sean Spicer, tended to raise Trump\u2019s own anxiety levels. But Sanders is different, and she matters right now more than you might think a press secretary could. The way several current and former officials put it: Sanders keeps the president from flipping out every day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial,\u201d one former administration official says. \u201cVitally important,\u201d another former official says, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s replaceable. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another one out there like her.\u201d\n\nAnd her role is growing. After communications director and Trump confidante Hope Hicks announced in February that she would be leaving the White House, Sanders was asked to add the communications job to her current duties, according to a White House official and another source familiar with the situation. Sanders stayed put, but she is expected to step into Hicks\u2019 shoes in another sense, taking on some portion of her role advising and supporting a volatile president.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nThe public hasn\u2019t always been kind to Sanders, who gets caricatured as a sour, irritable figure in cartoons and has become a lightning rod for public frustration with the Trump administration\u2019s vexed relationship with facts. But those who have known her for years see a different person: They swear by her as loyal, professional, charming and witty. She manages to keep up with former colleagues spanning years and, in a rare instance of Washington collegiality, remains close with the person whose job she took, Spicer. Some reporters even cop behind the scenes to liking her. So how does that person transform into someone so different during briefings, a kind of denier-in-chief at a critical moment for American democracy?\n\nIt all has to do with her relationship with her one-person audience, and what the role of press secretary has become under him. And the secret to that lies in just how she got to the White House in the first place.\n\n\n\n***\n\nTo truly appreciate Sarah Huckabee Sanders, you first must appreciate what the job did to Sean Spicer. A longtime political trench fighter and Republican National Committee veteran, he combusted under the pressure of delivering Trump\u2019s message. The job required him to lie, his answers were picked apart, and he got caught up in the infighting of the early Trump White House. \u201cThere used to be a process that everything followed, and I think that rulebook went out the door,\u201d Spicer says. Everything in the Trump White House, he says, was harder. \u201cYou pick the variable, it\u2019s times 10.\u201d\n\nSanders did not come from Washington, or from institutional politics at all\u2014she spent years learning from a very different rulebook. Trump was not the first charismatic, populist conservative she worked for. The other one put her on the job at age 9.\n\nIn 1992, her father, Mike Huckabee, ran his first statewide campaign, as a Republican for U.S. Senate from Arkansas. \u201cFrom the time she was in elementary school, she saw politics up close and personal,\u201d Huckabee says. \u201cShe was involved in it, everything from going with me to campaign on weekends and passing out fliers at county fairs.\u201d\n\nThe pastor-turned-candidate would hand his daughter $5 and a stack of fliers, and tell her that once all the fliers were gone, she could treat herself to some cotton candy or a ride. That first campaign did not go well, but he came back a year later to win a special election for lieutenant governor, and then the year after that to defend his seat. It marked his third statewide campaign in three years. Sarah was 11. \u201cShe was always wanting to be in the room,\u201d Huckabee recalls. \u201cI can remember her standing around the kitchen table listening to Dick Morris explain crosstabs.\u201d\n\nThe Family Business Sanders\u2019 formative experience was her father\u2019s 2008 campaign for president, a family-centered endeavor not unlike the one she would join eight years later: the Trump White House. | Al Drago/Redux; Michael Stravato/Redux\n\nSanders wasn\u2019t shielded from the unpleasant side of the business. \u201cArkansas politics were pretty brutal,\u201d Huckabee says, recounting the personal attacks he faced in a still-Democratic state that had recently been governed by Bill Clinton. And then, there was the glare of the press. When the teenage Sarah got in a car crash, it made the papers. Huckabee, who would go on to serve as governor for a decade, thought the broadcast media was fair, but, in his view, \u201cthe print press in Arkansas were pretty slanted, and for the most part overwhelmingly pro-Democrat.\u201d\n\nAs her friend Leslie Rutledge, a former Huckabee staffer who is now Arkansas attorney general, put it, \u201cShe lived a press briefing every single day as a child.\u201d\n\nWhatever came, the family rallied around the patriarch, and Sarah walked closely in his footsteps. In high school at Little Rock Central, she joined the mock trial and debate clubs, and was named secretary of the Arkansas Federation of Teenage Republicans. \u201cWe chose her because she was capable,\u201d one member said at the time. \u201cIt just so happens that she\u2019s also the governor\u2019s daughter.\u201d Then she attended his alma mater, Ouachita Baptist University, in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and, while there, worked on his 2002 reelection campaign as a field coordinator. That year, spurred on by her dad, she also enlisted as the lead plaintiff in a voting rights case. An area judge had stripped college students of their right to vote in local elections, and Sanders signed on with the ACLU to fight the ruling. They won, freeing hundreds of students on the conservative Christian campus to vote for Mike Huckabee.\n\nIn another person, such a record might seem transparently ambitious. But that\u2019s not what Sanders was like, says her former political science professor, Hal Bass. \u201cShe was a delight to be with, she was fun. \u2026 She smiled, she was witty,\u201d Bass says. \u201cI think you don\u2019t see a lot of that in her public persona now.\u201d\n\nTeam Trump Colleagues have described Sanders as \u201ctough\u201d but \u201crelatable.\u201d Below: Sanders with Ivanka Trump at the Winter Olympics; with Hope Hicks; and with Rob Porter and Gary Cohn in the Oval Office. | Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images; Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nSanders\u2019 truly formative experience was her dad\u2019s 2008 campaign for president, a family-centered endeavor not unlike the one Sanders would join eight years later. After working for George W. Bush after college, she returned as her father\u2019s national political director, planting herself in Iowa to lead the campaign\u2019s efforts there. Former Huckabee colleagues remember her willingness to perform any task, pull all-nighters and speak frankly with her father. Through long days and late nights and bull sessions at P.F. Chang\u2019s, she grew close to several staffers, including a volunteer named Bryan Sanders, who would be hired full-time and later become her husband.\n\nDuring the primaries, Huckabee, the bass guitar-playing former governor who had lost more than 100 pounds and run a marathon, emerged as something of a media darling. But members of the campaign, including his daughter, quickly grew frustrated with the cartoon pastor they believed was being portrayed on TV. \u201cWe were the original \u2018They\u2019re not treating us fair\u2019 group,\u201d says Chip Saltsman, Huckabee\u2019s 2008 campaign manager.\n\nHuckabee surged to an upset win in Iowa, but by March was swamped by John McCain and out of the race. As her dad\u2019s point person in Iowa, though, Sanders had a real win under her belt, something that could have helped punch her ticket in national politics. Instead, she decided to run her dad\u2019s PAC, aimed at supporting candidates who aligned with his views. Sanders would take on other clients: She ran John Boozman\u2019s successful 2010 campaign for U.S. Senate from Arkansas, and briefly worked on Tim Pawlenty\u2019s doomed 2012 run for president. But when her dad decided to throw his hat in the ring for 2016, she signed on as his campaign manager. It gave her a front-row seat to the hurricane about to hit the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n***\n\nMike Huckabee was standing backstage on July 18, 2015, at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, when candidate Donald Trump made his feelings known about John McCain. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He is a war hero because he was captured,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d\n\nThe former Arkansas governor remembers a Trump staffer standing next to him turning and saying, \u201cWell, I think I may have the shortest tenure of any political consultant.\u201d But Huckabee had a different take. \u201cI was watching and listening to the crowd and how they reacted, and I thought, \u2018Mmm, boy,\u2019\u201d Huckabee says.\n\nHis daughter\u2019s read was similar. When Huckabee dropped out of the race after pulling only 1.8 percent of the vote in Iowa, Sanders needed a new political home. Surveying the field, she wondered, who had the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton? \u201cSarah is from Arkansas, you have to remember,\u201d says her husband, Bryan Sanders. \u201cAnd she\u2019s grown up her whole life with the Clintons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the driving force,\u201d he says. \u201cThat we have to do everything in our power to defeat Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nShe liked Trump\u2019s chances, as well as his message, her husband says. \u201cHer dad and Trump were saying a lot of the same things,\u201d Bryan Sanders says. \u201cThey were talking about how Washington needs a big change. They were both running very anti-establishment campaigns.\u201d\n\nIn other ways, though, Trump could not have been more different from her father. Huckabee is a man of God who raised his children to be deeply Christian; Trump lived like he had a giant Bingo card of sins and was trying to check off every box. Bryan Sanders says his wife\u2019s faith is \u201cthe defining aspect of her life,\u201d which actually made Trump more appealing to her. She liked what he was saying about abortion and religious liberty, as well as the types of judges he was promising to appoint, including to the Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see why evangelicals supported him,\u201d her husband says.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s personal flaws? \u201cNobody who ever held office is sin-free,\u201d Mike Huckabee says. \u201cPart of it is she understands that the nature of human life is that everyone is a sinner.\u201d To explain, he brings up the German industrialist Oskar Schindler\u2014\u201ca scoundrel, he was really a terrible person\u201d\u2014who also risked his livelihood to save hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust. (When I stopped, and asked Huckabee whether he was really making a comparison between Donald Trump and Oskar Schindler, Huckabee said, \u201cNo, not necessarily. I mean it could be, but it\u2019s just a bigger principle.\u201d)\n\nOn the Job Artwork by Sanders\u2019 children hangs in her office, and a copy of Gone With the Wind sits on a bookshelf. | Evan Vucci/AP\n\nSo Sanders signed on with Trump. With her Christian bona fides and steady demeanor, she quickly became one of the campaign\u2019s most reliable surrogates. \u201cWhen we deployed her, we deployed her under challenging conditions,\u201d says Bryan Lanza, who managed surrogates for the Trump campaign. \u201cShe\u2019s a professional operative, and, in this business, and especially in Trumpworld, there were very few of those.\u201d\n\nTrump took notice. \u201cWatching her on TV during the campaign, he was really impressed with her,\u201d Hicks says. Trump would ask Hicks for Sanders\u2019 phone number so he could compliment her performance, or he would instruct Hicks to email her on his behalf. \u201cHe would always comment on how unflappable she was, how articulate she was, how insightful she was,\u201d Hicks says, \u201cand just really tough in those sometimes challenging circumstances.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the emergence of the famed \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Trump boasted of grabbing women's genitals, it was Sanders who went on CNN with Jake Tapper to vouch for her candidate. She condemned Trump\u2019s words but said the Christian thing to do would be to accept his apology. \u201cBoth of these candidates are flawed,\u201d she told Tapper. \u201cThere is no perfect person.\u201d When Tapper pressed her on whether Trump would apologize to any women he had, in fact, grabbed, Sanders executed a perfect Trump campaign parry: \u201cHas Hillary Clinton apologized to the four American lives that were lost in Benghazi?\u201d\n\nIn Trumpworld, \u201cBilly Bush weekend\u201d was seen as a dividing line: If you were in, you were really in, and if you were out, it would be impossible to ever truly recover with Trump. Sanders was in.\n\nOfficially hired as Spicer\u2019s deputy a day before Trump took office, she received her first chance to brief the press in May 2017, while Spicer was away on Naval Reserve duty. Before that, she had worked only as a political tactician\u2014never in PR\u2014and, watching her early briefings, one former administration official worried that her downhome delivery was not polished enough for Trump. \u201cI was sitting there going, 'Trump\u2019s head has got to be blowing up,'\u201d the former official says. \u201cAnd he loved it.\u201d Trump just kept saying, \u201cShe\u2019s got a way about her,\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s really solid.\u201d He also has said that she is \u201csmart like her father.\u201d\n\n\u201cTough but relatable, that\u2019s how he has described her to me, and I agree,\u201d White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, Trump started pushing for Sanders to do more briefings. With speculation over Spicer\u2019s fate running rampant, Sanders and her husband discussed what she would say if Trump were to offer her the job of press secretary. Finally, on July 21, Spicer resigned. At the time, Bryan Sanders and their three children were on vacation with his family at Acadia National Park in Maine; she had cut her vacation short and returned to Washington. He was hiking in the woods with the kids when he got a text. It said, \u201cI\u2019m the next press secretary.\u201d\n\nSanders immediately brought a sense of order to a press shop that had been under siege, and she dialed down the temperature in the briefing room. One White House reporter assessed the transition from Spicer behind the podium to Sanders like this: \u201cShe\u2019s a calm, competent professional. She may lie, but she\u2019s just a lot more unflappable and calm when she\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to have the angst that he had about it,\u201d the reporter added.\n\n\n\n***\n\nSanders has developed a number of signature moves at the podium. She\u2019ll call a question \u201cinappropriate,\u201d or deflect with a joke, sometimes about her kids. She\u2019ll say she doesn\u2019t know an answer and needs to find out, or that she simply hasn\u2019t had the occasion to speak with the president on the matter. Often, she\u2019ll start a briefing late so that it runs short, or bring in another official to kill time. But reporters grow most infuriated when she flatly backs up the president when everyone in the room knows he\u2019s wrong. Behold this exchange from October 10 between Trey Yingst, a reporter for the conservative-friendly One America News, and Sanders:\n\nThe Play for Time Reading a letter from a Trump supporter.\n\n\n\nThe Guest Appearance Full-Body Feint Bringing out another administration official to talk before the briefing begins.\n\n\n\nThe Joke Jab and Grab \u201cThe president was clearly joking.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe \u2018I\u2019-Word Hook \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 highly inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Briefing Bob-and-Weave \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken with him about it, so I\u2019d have to get back to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Saved by the Bell \u201cArriving late to the briefing and leaving early for unspecified appointments.\u201d llustrations by Patrick Welsh\n\nYINGST: The president repeated this claim in the Oval Office today, saying we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world.

That\u2019s a fact.\n\nYINGST: But that\u2019s not what the president said.\n\nSANDERS: That\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about.

He said we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world.\n\nSANDERS: The highest-taxed corporate nation. It seems pretty consistent to me. Sorry, we\u2019re just going to have to agree to disagree.\n\nSome reporters will outright call Sanders a liar. Others are more reluctant to break out the L-word but still become frustrated at the way she regularly obfuscates and bends the truth. Whereas Spicer was known for big blowups, reporters say that with Sanders it feels more like a million small things. \u201cThere\u2019s almost sometimes an exhaustion writing the stories of the daily briefing because the number of things she says that are patently false are too many to let your story be weighed down with them,\u201d one White House reporter says.\n\nHere is a highly incomplete list of Sanders\u2019 misadventures with the truth:\n\nAugust 2, 2017: Said Trump didn\u2019t lie when he claimed the Mexican president called to praise his immigration policies, or when he said leaders from the Boy Scouts of America called to praise a speech he gave at the National Scout Jamboree. (Neither call had occurred.)\n\nNovember 1, 2017: Said immigrants entering the United States on diversity visas aren\u2019t vetted. (They are.)\n\nNovember 2, 2017: Denied that Trump called the U.S. justice system \u201ca joke.\u201d (Hours earlier, Trump said of the justice system, \u201cWhat we have right now, it\u2019s a joke and it\u2019s a laughingstock.\u201d)\n\nFebruary 20, 2018: Said, \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t said that Russia didn\u2019t meddle.\u201d (He has.)\n\nMarch 27, 2018: Said there has been a citizenship question \u201cincluded in every census since 1965, with the exception of 2010, when it was removed.\u201d (No citizenship question has appeared on the full census form since 1950.)\n\nSanders declined to comment for this article. But both her husband and father say that any characterization of her as a liar is unfair. \u201cAll I know is that Sarah is never going to do anything that violates her conscience,\u201d Bryan Sanders says. \u201cShe\u2019s never been asked to do something that violates her conscience.\u201d\n\nBy blowing up his credibility live on TV, Spicer appears to have sacrificed the type of juicy book deal or sweet corporate gig that usually greets press secretaries on the other side of the job. But Sanders appears unconcerned with that. Those around her say she has never been one to look ahead, instead always focusing on the job at hand and, as she has since she was 9, loyally fighting for the person she works for.\n\n\u201cSarah and her father are like Ivanka and her father,\u201d Conway says. \u201cThey\u2019re very close, and the daughters came into the family business. There\u2019s a similarity.\u201d\n\nWhatever the cost to her credibility, there\u2019s no question Sanders\u2019 stature in the White House has grown. She has become one of the few people able to actually talk with the president, and even move his position, multiple officials say. They speak before most briefings, and while she can be direct, one senior administration official describes the particularly deft way Sanders has developed of pushing back on Trump. Typically, she does not bluntly disagree with him, but walks him through how the press might react to something. For instance, the official says, if Sanders objects to a strategy Trump has suggested, she might say, \u201cWell, here\u2019s what the follow-up question on that issue is going to be, so how would we answer that?\u201d It\u2019s a tactic that allows her to redirect the president without having to directly tell him he\u2019s wrong.\n\nAnd she has another skill particularly valuable when working for a boss who doesn\u2019t always operate according to a plan. When issues come up that Trump has not yet addressed, Sanders is adept at channeling his thinking, according to Conway. \u201cSarah is really deft about speaking for the president on matters [where] he has not yet done so,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cShe gets it. You can\u2019t have these jobs unless you really understand the principal, and she does,\u201d Conway says. \u201cHe respects her, and when she disagrees with him or has questions, it\u2019s always phrased in a respectful manner. The tough person you see on TV is the tough person here as well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hicks, \u201cTheir relationship has gotten a lot stronger since she officially took over the podium.\u201d In addition to their time together in the White House, the president calls Sanders frequently at home.\n\nSarah and her father are like Ivanka and her father. They\u2019re very close, and the daughters came into the family business. There\u2019s a similarity.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Sanders also has come to enjoy a better reputation than you might imagine with White House reporters. When they go to confirm something with her off-camera, she has a reputation for dealing honestly, typically waving them off inaccurate stories and not pushing back on true ones. Some reporters\u2014especially those from smaller outlets\u2014complain that she ignores them and comes off as contemptuous, but others find her to be accessible and understanding of their role. \u201cIt\u2019s different than the show, what you see on TV,\u201d says one, who added that Sanders is often helpful in facilitating logistics.\n\nSo how does this person square with the one behind the podium?\n\nIn the course of reporting this article, I asked more than a dozen of her friends and colleagues what motivates her. The answer was never one issue. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk a whole lot about policy,\u201d recalls Matt Reisetter, a Huckabee campaign staffer who spent hours with Sanders in Iowa. The picture that emerged is someone driven by the far more elemental force of loyalty.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t consider the president an employer,\u201d says Saltsman, the former Huckabee campaign manager, with whom she remains close. \u201cFrom her point of view, she\u2019s defending a family member, because that\u2019s how she\u2019s always done it.\u201d\n\nHuckabee agrees. \u201cI think there may be a lot of truth to that,\u201d he says. \u201cShe believes her job is to speak for the person who entrusted you.\u201d Speaking for Trump, though, has risks.\n\n\n\n***\n\nBefore every briefing, Sanders prays and reads from a book of devotions in her office overlooking the White House lawn. Artwork by her children hangs on a board behind her desk, and across the room is a shelf with a few books, including The Christian Life and Character and Gone With the Wind. She\u2019s the first mother to serve in the job, and nearly everyone who deals with her marvels at her ability to balance work and life.\n\nSpicer says one of the biggest challenges of the job is how fluid information can be. \u201cWhen you work for Trump, put your seat belt on and get ready,\u201d he says. \u201cOn a daily basis, you\u2019re trying to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information you have. And the problem is that in a lot of cases, it\u2019s a constantly evolving issue or process.\u201d\n\nSometimes issues evolve in world-changing ways. Just after 4 p.m. on March 8, Sanders was ensconced inside the office with her top deputies, expecting to be tied up in meetings for the rest of the afternoon. That\u2019s when a staffer burst into her office, telling her that Trump, with Vice President Mike Pence in his wake, had just marched from the Oval Office by her door and was on his way to go speak to the press. Sanders hurried down the hall into the briefing room, where\u2014shocking reporters with his impromptu appearance\u2014Trump said there would be a major announcement at 7 p.m. And then, poof, he was gone.\n\nOlivier Douliery/Abaca\n\nAs reporters scrambled to figure out what was going on, Trump\u2019s press officers seemed as clueless as anyone else. Sanders knew Trump had been meeting with a South Korean delegation, and as they walked from the briefing room back to his residence, he explained to her the rest: He had just accepted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s invitation to meet. This was a sudden, radical change in American policy toward a rogue regime, and it sent the military and State Department scrambling. In the next day\u2019s briefing, Sanders added conditions to the meeting\u2014North Korea had to take concrete steps toward denuclearization\u2014acting as though nothing had changed from the day before. Her newly fabricated reality likely pleased Trump, though the headlines were less kind, focusing on the walk-back.\n\nThe Korea episode came on the heels of Sanders\u2019 most difficult stretch in the White House. In early February, reports broke that staff secretary Rob Porter\u2019s ex-wives were accusing him of mental and physical abuse. Sanders was friends with Porter and close with Hicks, whom Porter was then dating. Based on Porter\u2019s denial, Sanders gave the Daily Mail, which broke the story, a statement supporting him.\n\nThen pictures showing Porter\u2019s alleged abuse became public. At that point, the standard PR playbook calls for showing contrition, cutting losses and moving on. But Sanders worked off the Trump playbook, which forbids backing down. She read a statement from Porter at a briefing that referred to the allegations as \u201ca coordinated smear campaign.\u201d She convened a group of four reporters, off the record, to let Porter defend himself in person. Even amid the #MeToo movement, \u201cEarly, she gave Rob the benefit of the doubt,\u201d says a person close to the situation.\n\nAs the White House fumbled, questions about what the administration knew and when mushroomed into bigger stories about why Porter\u2014and then several others, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser\u2014had for so long been allowed to work with interim security clearances.\n\nIn a February 12 briefing, Sanders said the White House had learned of the extent of the allegations against Porter just six days earlier, and had accepted his resignation \u201cwithin 24 hours.\u201d The next day, though, FBI Director Christopher Wray directly contradicted her, testifying under oath to Congress that the White House had been made aware of the allegations multiple times, and months earlier.\n\nSanders was blistered in the press, and grew frustrated at the breakdown in process around her. \u201cSarah\u2019s frustration was, you\u2019re sending me out there and I don\u2019t have the answers to all of these questions,\u201d says the person close to the situation. \u201cHow can you send me out there to answer all these questions when you have not given me the answers?\u201d\n\nIn the next briefing, after Wray\u2019s testimony, Sanders maintained that Wray\u2019s explanation was compatible with hers, arguing the White House personnel security office was not supposed to share information with other West Wing staffers, but her wording was noticeably cautious. Asked whether anyone in the White House personnel security office\u2014which would have received the reports on Porter from the FBI\u2014communicated with anyone in the West Wing about his clearance, Sanders replied, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any communication. I can\u2019t say definitively, but I\u2019m not aware of any communication.\u201d\n\nThe Porter episode wasn\u2019t just a disaster for Sanders, but for Trump himself. The snowballing scandal ended up costing Kushner and several others their security clearances, and derailed the administration\u2019s agenda for weeks. Since then, some reporters have noticed Sanders couching her language more carefully at briefings. Phrases like, \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d and \u201cas far as I\u2019m aware\u201d seem more frequent.\n\nLately, Trump\u2019s impulsive decisions have also seemed to become ever more frequent. In March, after the Washington Post reported that national security adviser H.R. McMaster was on his way out, Sanders denied any problem, tweeting, \u201cJust spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\u201d\n\nA week later, McMaster was gone, and the credibility of Sanders\u2014or anyone who purported to speak for Trump\u2014was questioned anew.\n\nApril Ryan, the American Urban Radio Networks correspondent known for her battles with Sanders, believes the job is taking its toll on her. \u201cThe stakes are so high, and people are very angry,\u201d Ryan says, noting that Sanders has been the subject of countless attacks, some related to her job, but also many unfair personal ones. \u201cWe\u2019ve had conversations about our war wounds,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cAnything negative, after a while, it wears on you.\u201d\n\nHow long will Sanders last? Rutledge, the Arkansas attorney general and former Huckabee campaign lawyer, says there\u2019s \u201calways speculation back home in Arkansas whether she would come back and run.\u201d But Bryan Sanders says his wife has no plans to go anywhere anytime soon. \u201cSome days are better than others,\u201d he says, but \u201cshe loves her job.\u201d\n\nOutwardly, Sanders has shown only the smallest signs of cracks\u2014the extra \u201cas far as I know\u201d here or \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d there. She has remained loyal. \u201cShe goes into the White House every day, and she\u2019s focused on the day ahead, doing her job to the very best of her abilities every day. She\u2019s not thinking about what\u2019s next,\u201d her husband says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that her dad\u2019s always taught her.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the date of Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 first press briefing.",
