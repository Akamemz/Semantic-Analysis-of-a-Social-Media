    "content": "Contractors working for the Trump administration are blowing apart a mountain on protected lands in southern Arizona to make way for the president \u2019 s border wall . The blasting is happening on the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument , a tract of Sonoran Desert wilderness long celebrated as one of the nation \u2019 s great ecological treasures , that holds profound spiritual significance to multiple Native American groups . In a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that the blasting began this week and will continue through the end of the month . \u201c The construction contractor has begun controlled blasting , in preparation for new border wall system construction , within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain in the U.S. Border Patrol \u2019 s Tucson Sector , \u201d the statement said , referring to an area also known as Monument Hill . \u201c The controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month. \u201d The agency added that it \u201c will continue to have an environmental monitor present during these activities as well as on-going clearing activities. \u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva , an Arizona Democrat and chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he has zero faith that the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s \u201c environmental monitor will do anything to avoid , mitigate , or even point out some of the sacrilegious things that are occurring and will continue to occur , given the way they \u2019 re proceeding . \u201d\nGrijalva \u2019 s blunt assessment is based on a visit he made to Organ Pipe last month , alongside archaeologists and leaders of the Tohono O \u2019 odham Nation , whose ancestral homelands and sacred burial sites are in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump \u2019 s border wall expansion . One of those burial sites lies just beyond the westward advance of the border wall , Grijalva explained . \u201c It \u2019 s right in the path , \u201d he said , meaning that \u201c the one indignation of the blasting on the hill is shortly to follow with other indignations and disrespect. \u201d According to Grijalava , \u201c DHS had mentioned to the tribes that they would back off on developing the hill , but the work is still being done. \u201d The agency has consistently failed in its legal obligation to meaningfully consult with tribal stakeholders in southern Arizona , Grijalva said . The blasting that \u2019 s happening now , he added , \u201c is just the crudest indication of what \u2019 s going on. \u201d Celebrated as \u201c a pristine example of an intact Sonoran Desert ecosystem , \u201d Organ Pipe was designated as a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve in 1976 . Even before the explosions began , the construction there was already one of Trump \u2019 s most controversial border wall projects , unfolding on the homelands of the Tohono O \u2019 odham and in areas that are ostensibly safeguarded by the strictest public-land designations on the books .\nNeither factor has stopped contractors from drilling into the ground and draining water from a rare desert aquifer in order to mix concrete to support a towering , 30-foot barrier along the U.S.-Mexico divide . In working to fulfill the president \u2019 s chief campaign promise , construction crews on Organ Pipe have uprooted saguaro cacti , slicing the iconic plants into chunks and bulldozed a wide roadway to make room for trucks , cranes , and other construction vehicles .\n\u201c A historically significant area is going to be changed irreparably . You \u2019 re never going to be able to put it back together . \u201d\nWith the wall in place , and its floodlights illuminating the area through the night , the migration of several rare desert animal species is expected to come to an end . The construction is particularly threatening to Quitobaquito Springs , the only naturally occurring source of fresh water for miles around . The desert oasis was once inhabited by the Hia Ced O \u2019 odham \u2014 a smaller , though distinct O \u2019 odham tribe \u2014 and remains a monumentally important spiritual site for the O \u2019 odham people to this day . \u201c A historically significant area is going to be changed irreparably , \u201d Grijalva said . \u201c You \u2019 re never going to be able to put it back together . \u201d\nThe expansion of the border wall under Trump has been made possible , in part , by a post-9/11 piece of legislation known as the Real ID Act , which grants DHS sweeping authority to waive existing laws in order to construct border barriers . The Trump administration has used the act to waive dozens of laws \u2014 from the Environmental Protection Act to the Endangered Species Act \u2014 in order to push through new border wall construction projects . In Arizona , the administration \u2019 s efforts have been bolstered by the fact that federal lands , rather than private property , comprise much of the border . Following his visit to Organ Pipe last month , Grijalva , sent a letter to Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf , expressing \u201c serious concerns \u201d that the department was \u201c not respecting tribal lands and sacred sites as they proceed with border wall plans and construction . \u201d\n\u201c What \u2019 s particularly frightening right now is that Trump has weaponized DHS , politically weaponized them . \u201d\nAccompanying Grijalva \u2019 s complaint was a letter from Ned Norris Jr. , chair of the Tohono O \u2019 odham Nation , to the U.S. Border Patrol , in which Norris reported that border wall construction on Organ Pipe had already \u201c resulted in the inadvertent discovery of human remains \u201d near Quitobaquito Springs . \u201c It \u2019 s been really frustrating , \u201d Grijalva said . \u201c You would think that in a situation like this , that involves human remains , burial sites , bone fragments that are traced and dated a thousand years or more back , that there would be some sensitivity , for lack of a better word , on the part of DHS and the administration . There is none. \u201d The entire episode is deeply political , Grijalva said , with the Trump administration clearly bent on completing as many new miles of wall construction as possible ahead of the 2020 election . \u201c What \u2019 s particularly frightening right now is that Trump has weaponized DHS , politically weaponized them , \u201d Grijalva explained . \u201c And so right now , it \u2019 s about satisfying that political agenda. \u201d \u201c The consequence of that , the intended consequence of that , is situations like this , \u201d Grijalva said . \u201c Situations like South Texas .
