    "content": "The country is in better shape than it was when Barack Obama became president four years ago . The economy is no longer in free fall , and the nation has for the most part extricated itself from seemingly endless wars abroad .\nYet as Obama prepares to enter his second term , there seems to be less optimism about his ability to address the nation 's problems than was the case when he first entered the White House .\nA lot of that has to do with rancorous relations with Congress . Obama scored huge legislative victories during his first two years in office , but since Republicans took control of the House in 2010 , he 's been lucky just to avoid fiscal calamity through last-minute deals .\n`` We just had an election that gave us the status quo , '' says Gary Jacobson , a political scientist at the University of California , San Diego . `` If you did n't like the last two years , then the next four do n't look so attractive . ''\nNot only does Obama face continuing GOP opposition in Congress , but as a second-term president , he necessarily generates less excitement than he did as a newcomer \u2014 particularly as someone who made history as the nation 's first African-American president .\n`` The excitement you always get in Washington when there 's change is not there , '' says William Schneider , a senior fellow at Third Way , a centrist think tank . `` This was a vote for continuity . ''\nAbout a week ago , Gallup released a poll asking Americans what they felt was the most important problem facing the country . `` Dissatisfaction with government '' was the third-most-mentioned problem , at 18 percent , behind the economy and the federal budget deficit .\nIt was the most worried that Americans have been about government since Watergate , according to Gallup .\n`` The dissatisfaction with Washington is pretty intense right now , '' says Karlyn Bowman , a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute . `` The mood about the way this city is working is so grim . ''\nIn the coming months , Obama faces fresh fights with Congress about the debt ceiling and spending cuts . Republicans wo n't be inclined to give him much of what he wants .\n`` In many ways , polarization is even worse than it was before \u2014 and it was bad then , '' says George Edwards , a visiting political scientist at Oxford University . `` Republicans truly hate him , so the idea of getting cooperation is a long shot . ''\nObama also will seek to break the years-old logjam over immigration policy , and there are some indications that Republicans will want to make a deal on this issue . The GOP , however , is unlikely to embrace the package of gun control measures the president recently outlined .\n`` People who voted for the House majority have no stake in Obama 's success , '' says Jacobson , the UC San Diego professor . `` The guys that got elected to the House do n't have to adapt to the changing world . ''\nOn The Agenda President Obama was sketchy about outlining his second-term agenda during the campaign but nonetheless faces a full plate . Fiscal Issues : Obama and Congress must come to terms about spending cuts , the debt ceiling and funding government operations for the rest of the fiscal year .
