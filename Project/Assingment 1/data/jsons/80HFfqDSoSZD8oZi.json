They certainly have long stopped standing up for fiscal responsibility , and though they held on to their free trade principles for some time and seemed to understand that trade `` remedies '' ( such as tariffs ) mostly hurt the American people rather than foreign exporters , that did n't last long after Donald Trump took office . It 's astonishing what the Trump presidency has done to the GOP 's position on trade .\nBut really , this all started during the presidential campaign , when Trump 's constant railing against trade and trade agreements seemed to prod other Republican candidates , such as Sens . Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , to talk about `` fair '' trade ( protectionism ) as opposed to `` free '' trade .\nNow that he 's in office , Trump has followed through with a comprehensive protectionist agenda\u2014threatening foreign governments with a multi-front trade war , which he claims will be easy for us to win . Most recently , Trump imposed stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum against , among others , the European Union , Canada , and Mexico\u2014which may be followed with tariffs on automobiles . Adding insult to injury , he 's justifying his actions by claiming that imports of steel and aluminum\u2014and automobiles , for that matter\u2014from these countries `` threaten to impair the national security '' of the United States . Never mind that six of the top 10 providers of steel to the U.S. are our NATO allies and closest friends .\nIn the face of a diplomatic backlash and a likely negative economic impact , the Republicans in Congress are doing nothing . It 's not because they lack the power ; they lack the backbone .

They could also reclaim some of the authority they delegated to the president to impose tariffs , as a few , including Sens .

These tariffs will jack up the price of producing goods made with steel within the United States .

The dangers of Trump 's move will become very clear when those former allies drag our protectionist leaders before the World Trade Organization and the United States loses as experts predict we will .\nMany of us have long surmised that the Republican Party stands for little more than low taxes , but at least it used to show some sort of commitment to free trade .
