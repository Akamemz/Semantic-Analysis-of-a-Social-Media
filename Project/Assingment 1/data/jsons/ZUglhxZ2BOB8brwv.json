Federal agencies will reopen for three weeks while lawmakers continue negotiations over Trump 's request for funding for a wall along the southern border .\nThis shutdown was unlike any before it . Along with setting a grim record for its length , it led to an even deeper divide between Republicans and Democrats and gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi her first test with going head-to-head with the president .\nHere is a look back at some of the biggest moments of the partial government shutdown :\nIt was a fight for the ages and the public was invited to watch .\nTrump told Democratic leaders in a remarkable on-camera clash he would be `` proud '' to shut down the federal government if he doesn \u2019 t get the $ 5.7 billion he demands for a border wall with Mexico .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t get what we want ... we will shut down the government , '' Trump said during an exchange in the Oval Office with Pelosi and Schumer .\nPelosi and Schumer gave as good as they got , telling Trump he lacks support for border wall funding \u2013 even while Republicans still control the House \u2013 and is irresponsible in threatening to halt the government over a project that would be ineffective at best .\nA short-term spending bill that would fund the government through early this year cleared the Senate , a solution aimed at averting a government shutdown .\nSenators voted by voice vote to approve the spending measure , which would temporarily end a budget impasse by funding nine federal departments and several smaller agencies at their current funding levels through Feb. 8 .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , offered the temporary spending bill after Trump \u2019 s demand for $ 5 billion in funding for a wall along the nation \u2019 s southern border resulted in a standoff that threatened to shut down parts of the government .\nIt was n't clear whether Trump would sign the measure but the White House appeared to retreat from Trump 's position of being `` proud '' to shutdown the government and take any blame for the impasse .\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said one day earlier that Trump asked his Cabinet secretaries to look for other sources of funding to help protect the border and suggested that the administration is looking to Congress for ways to avoid a shutdown .\nDec. 20 : Trump wo n't sign bill ; House adds border funds\nA deeply divided House voted to add $ 5 billion in border wall funding to a short-term spending bill , yielding to Trump \u2019 s demand for the money but casting further doubts that the government would shutdown .\nThe bill , which the House approved by a vote of 217-185 , was sent back to the Senate for another vote .\nThe House vote capped a drama-filled day that started with lawmakers anticipating quick passage of an already approved Senate funding bill . The day broke into chaos after the president said he would not approve of the Senate 's bill since it did not include border funds . The announcement led to House members adding $ 5.7 billion for a border wall but also meant the Senate would have to vote again on the spending bill .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve made my position very clear : Any measure that funds the government must include border security , \u201d Trump said at the White House .\nA flurry of negotiations in the Senate could n't muster up enough votes to pass the House 's spending bill , leading to the partial government starting at midnight .\nCongressional leaders and the White House worked behind the scenes late Friday in hopes of striking a deal but Trump acknowledged that he was ready for `` a long shutdown . ''\nFor much of yet another chaotic day on Capitol Hill , lawmakers scrambled to piece together a last-minute agreement that would keep government funds flowing past Friday \u2019 s midnight deadline .\nAt midafternoon , Vice President Mike Pence and two of Trump \u2019 s top lieutenants \u2013 Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and adviser Jared Kushner \u2013 traveled to the Capitol for a series of meetings to try to broker a deal .\nAn agreement proved elusive , but in what was hailed as a bit of a breakthrough , congressional leaders and the White House agreed to continue their talks after a procedural vote in the Senate . Yet even that incremental step required a tie-breaking vote by Pence .\nJan. 2 : Dems meet with Trump at White House - again\nPelosi and Schumer left a meeting at the White House , telling reporters that both sides were no closer to resolving the dispute over border funds .\nSchumer said that Trump was using the shutdown as `` hostage '' to get what he wants . Democrats tried to persuade Trump to reopen the government and continuing to negotiate over funds for border security .\n`` The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple , '' Schumer said after the meeting . `` They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security . ''\nRepublicans agreed that no headway was made in negotiations to end the shutdown .\nNew members of Congress were officially sworn in , giving Democrats control of the House .\nLater that evening , the House passed two measures that would reopen the government and postpone bickering over border wall funds to February , giving lawmakers and the White House another month to negotiate .\nThe measures were viewed as symbolic efforts as no additional border funds were included . Trump had repeatedly said he would not sign any bill that did not include the $ 5.7 billion he was requesting to construct the wall .\nAnother meeting with top Democrats at the White House led to Trump teasing two new threats : to keep the shutdown going for possibly years and possibly declaring a national emergency to get the funding he desires for a border wall .\nAfter the meeting , Schumer told reporters that the president threatened to keep the government closed for `` months or even years '' if he does n't get the $ 5.7 billion for a wall .\n`` We told the President we needed the government open . He resisted , '' Schumer said . `` In fact , he said he would keep it closed for a very long period of time , months or even years . ''\nThe president , speaking from the Rose Garden , admitted he 'd made the threat and when asked , told reporters that he was also discussing the possibility of declaring a national emergency to go around Congress and get funding for his wall , adding `` I can do it if I want . ''\n`` We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country , absolutely , '' Trump said .\nIn his first formal Oval Office address , Trump told Americans that a border wall is needed to keep the country safe .\nTrump sought to pressure Democrats to agree to his request for $ 5.7 billion as a condition of ending the government shutdown . He also tried to ramp up support among Republicans who are getting nervous about government workers and others who are feeling the pain of the shutdown .\nTrump emphasized humanitarian issues in an apparent appeal to Democrats . But he also spent several minutes discussing what he said was a crime problem stemming from migrants entering the country illegally , although he did not note that migrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens .\n`` To every citizen , call Congress and tell them to finally , after all of these decades , secure our border , '' Trump said .\nIn their televised response , Pelosi and Schumer said Trump is using fear to try and achieve his wall at the expense of people who rely on government services .\n`` President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage , must stop manufacturing a crisis , and must reopen the government , '' Pelosi said .\nSchumer added : `` We don \u2019 t govern by temper tantrum , '' explaining `` no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down , hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage . ''\nTrump started off a meeting with top Democrats by offered candy . Things did n't end as sweet .\nTrump walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday and said he might declare a national emergency at the border after Democrats refused to yield to his demands for money for a border wall .\nSchumer said Trump abruptly ended the White House session after Pelosi said she did not support his border wall .\n`` He just got up and said we have nothing to discuss , and he walked out , '' Schumer said . `` He just walked out of the meeting . \u201d\nPence and Republican lawmakers disputed the Democrats \u2019 account and said the meeting ended after Democrats refused to offer a counterplan to reopen the government .\nRepublicans said that Trump offered to reopen the government immediately if Democrats would consider funding the $ 5.7 billion needed for a border wall . When Pelosi told him no , Trump left the meeting and said it was a waste of time .\nTrump blasted Democrats and touted his proposed border wall during a visit to Texas on Thursday hours after making his most explicit threat yet to declare a national emergency and sidestep Congress on the issue .\n\u201c If we had a barrier of any kind , a powerful barrier , whether its steel or concrete , we would stop it cold , \u201d Trump said of the drugs , crime and human trafficking he has said are pouring into the United States in what the White House increasingly frames as a `` crisis . ''\nTrump 's trip to McAllen , Texas , came hours after he laid out in his most explicit language yet a threat to bypass Democrats and declare a national emergency to free up additional funding for the border wall .\n`` If this doesn \u2019 t work out , probably I will do it \u2013 I would almost say definitely , \u201d Trump said of declaring a national emergency .\nWhile Trump was in Texas , the House worked to pass spending bills to reopen the government . The House passed measures to reopen the Agriculture Department , Department of Transportation and Department of Housing and Urban Development .\nThey also passed a measure to reopen federal financial agencies , such as the IRS and Treasury Department , both of which are vital to the upcoming tax refund season .\nAll of the bills aimed to put more pressure on Republicans and the Senate but were seen as symbolic as the president repeatedly said he would veto any measure that did n't include border wall funding .\nProminent lawmakers in Washington also met behind closed doors to find a compromise . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham held several talks in hopes of coming to some agreement to end the shutdown but they hit a snag .\n`` I have never been more depressed about moving forward than right now . I just don \u2019 t see a pathway forward , '' Graham said . He later called on Trump to declare a national emergency .\nJan. 16 : Pelosi says Trump should delay State of the Union\nPelosi asked the president to reschedule his State of the Union address this month if the government remains shuttered \u2013 or deliver it in writing .\n`` Sadly , given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week , I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th , '' Pelosi wrote in a letter to Trump on Wednesday .\nPelosi cited Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen 's designation of State of the Union addresses as a `` National Special Security Event , '' which requires a high level of security . The Secret Service is responsible for such events , but the agency , a part of the Department of Homeland Security , is affected by the shutdown .\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump `` has a right '' to give the speech and that Americans `` have the right '' to hear it .\n\u201c I think Speaker Pelosi is playing politics like I \u2019 ve never seen a speaker before , '' McCarthy said . `` I think it \u2019 s unbecoming of the office to disinvite the president . ''\nTrump threw a punch back at Pelosi by canceling her military plane for an overseas trip just one day after she suggested postponing his State of the Union address .\n\u201c Due to the Shutdown , I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels , Egypt and Afghanistan has been postponed , \u201d Trump wrote in a letter to the California Democrat . \u201c We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over . \u201d\nTrump did n't address Pelosi 's request that he delay the State of the Union but focused instead on her overseas trip , which he called `` a public relations event. \u201d Trump said it would be better if Pelosi were in Washington \u201c negotiating with me '' to end a partial government shutdown that is nearing its fifth week .\n\u201c Obviously , if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial , that would certainly be your prerogative , \u201d he concluded .\nAs the partial government shutdown neared a month , Trump used a White House speech to outline what he called \u201c a common-sense compromise both parties can embrace \u201d that included protections for some undocumented immigrants and money for border security .\n\u201c Both sides in Washington must simply come together , \u201d Trump said in a White House speech , saying he is trying to \u201c break the logjam . '' Defending his plan , he said , `` walls are not immoral , in fact they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives . ''\nIn remarks he billed as a `` major announcement , '' Trump cited a proposal developed by administration officials and Republican lawmakers , one that would grant work permits to certain migrants for three years in exchange for approval of wall funding .\nCongressional Democrats , however , said the offer as outlined would not lead to a deal that would end the shutdown , in part because it would allow Trump to pursue an expensive and ineffective wall and did not include permanent protections for immigrants who are living in the U.S. under DACA or temporary protected status .\nThey pointed out that Trump 's decisions put DACA in jeopardy to begin with and the deal was not enough .\n`` His proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives , each of which is unacceptable and in total , do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people \u2019 s lives , '' Pelosi said in a statement .\nAfter a bitter back-and-forth with Pelosi , the president decided to postpone his State of the Union address .\nIn a pair of late-night tweets , Trump explained that the House Chamber was the only appropriate place for the address , abandoning the search for an `` alternative '' location that he teased to reporters earlier in the day .\n`` As the Shutdown was going on , Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address . I agreed . She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown , suggesting a later date . This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over , '' Trump said .\nThe announcement came hours after Pelosi wrote a letter , telling Trump that the House would not allow the president to hold the address in the House chamber , where it 's traditionally held .\nTrump responded by lashing out at Pelosi , telling reporters `` the State of the Union speech has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn \u2019 t want to hear the truth . She does n't want the American public to hear what 's going on . ''\nJan. 24 : Bills to reopen the government fail but add glimmer of hope\nThe Senate rejected a pair of dueling bills to fund the federal government . But , the votes marked the first movement in the chamber to break the budget impasse that triggered the shutdown and signaled a possible path toward compromise .\nSenators voted down both a GOP bill that would provide $ 5.7 billion that Trump is demanding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and other concessions that Trump offered to Democrats over the weekend .

The president signed the measure late Friday.\n\nBut, if a compromise isn't made by Feb. 15, it's unclear what could happen next.\n\nAn impasse could mean another government shutdown or the president electing to use executive authority to redirect funds for his border wall.\n\nHe hinted at that possibility after announcing lawmakers had a three-week deadline.\n\n\"As everyone knows, I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully it will be unnecessary.\"\n\nContributing: Michael Collins, David Jacksonand Eliza Collins",
