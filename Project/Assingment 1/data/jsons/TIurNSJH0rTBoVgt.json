( AP Photo )\nBeijing ( AP ) \u2014 For decades , the Uighur imam was a bedrock of his farming community in China \u2019 s far west . On Fridays , he preached Islam as a religion of peace . On Sundays , he treated the sick with free herbal medicine . In the winter , he bought coal for the poor .\nBut as a Chinese government mass detention campaign engulfed Memtimin Emer \u2019 s native Xinjiang region three years ago , the elderly imam was swept up and locked away , along with all three of his sons living in China .\nNow , a newly revealed database exposes in extraordinary detail the main reasons for the detentions of Emer , his three sons , and hundreds of others in Karakax County : their religion and their family ties .\nThe database obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 profiles the internment of 311 individuals with relatives abroad and lists information on more than 2,000 of their relatives , neighbors and friends . Each entry includes the detainee \u2019 s name , address , national identity number , detention date and location , along with a detailed dossier on their family , religious and neighborhood background , the reason for detention , and a decision on whether or not to release them . Issued within the past year , the documents do not indicate which government department compiled them or for whom .\nTaken as a whole , the information offers the fullest and most personal view yet into how Chinese officials decided who to put into and let out of detention camps , as part of a massive crackdown that has locked away more than a million ethnic minorities , most of them Muslims .\nThe database emphasizes that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention \u2014 not just political extremism , as authorities claim , but ordinary activities such as praying , attending a mosque , or even growing a long beard . It also shows the role of family : People with detained relatives are far more likely to end up in a camp themselves , uprooting and criminalizing entire families like Emer \u2019 s in the process .\nSimilarly , family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behavior in whether they are released .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very clear that religious practice is being targeted , \u201d said Darren Byler , a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang . \u201c They want to fragment society , to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation . \u201d\nThe Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes requesting comment . Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families , foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said \u201c this kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on . \u201d\nBeijing has said before that the detention centers are for voluntary job training , and that it does not discriminate based on religion .\nChina has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang , where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing \u2019 s heavy-handed rule . With the 9/11 attacks in the United States , officials began using the specter of terrorism to justify harsher religious restrictions , saying young Uighurs were susceptible to Islamic extremism .\nAfter militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang \u2019 s capital in 2014 , President Xi Jinping launched a so-called \u201c People \u2019 s War on Terror \u201d , transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state .\nThe leak of the database from sources in the Uighur exile community follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works . The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists , which includes the AP , showed that the centers are in fact forced ideological and behavioral re-education camps run in secret . Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention .\nThe latest set of documents came from sources in the Uighur exile community , and the most recent date in them is March 2019 . The detainees listed come from Karakax County , a traditional settlement of about 650,000 on the edge of Xinjiang \u2019 s Taklamakan desert where more than 97 percent of residents are Uighur . The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents , Chinese identity verification tools , and other lists and documents seen by the AP .\nDetainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid , well-defined categories . Households are designated as \u201c trustworthy \u201d or \u201c not trustworthy , \u201d and their attitudes are graded as \u201c ordinary \u201d or \u201c good. \u201d Families have \u201c light \u201d or \u201c heavy \u201d religious atmospheres , and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a \u201c training center . \u201d\nOfficials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was \u2014 even if they hadn \u2019 t committed any crimes .\n\u201c It underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government , and how the government criminalizes everything , \u201d said Adrian Zenz , an expert on the detention centers and senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington , D.C .\nReasons listed for internment include \u201c minor religious infection , \u201d \u201c disturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons , \u201d \u201c relatives abroad , \u201d \u201c thinking is hard to grasp \u201d and \u201c untrustworthy person born in a certain decade. \u201d The last seems to refer to younger men ; about 31 percent of people considered \u201c untrustworthy \u201d were in the age bracket of 25 to 29 years , according to an analysis of the data by Zenz .\nWhen former student Abdullah Muhammad spotted Emer \u2019 s name on the list of the detained , he was distraught .\n\u201c He didn \u2019 t deserve this , \u201d Muhammad said . \u201c Everyone liked and respected him . He was the kind of person who couldn \u2019 t stay silent against injustice . \u201d\nEven in Karakax county , famed for its intellectuals and scholars , Emer stood out as one of the most renowned teachers in the region . Muhammad studied the Quran under Emer for six years as a kid , following him from house to house in an effort to dodge the authorities . Muhammad said Emer was so respected that the police would phone him with warnings ahead of time before raiding classes at his modest , single-story home of brick and mud .\nThough Emer gave Party-approved sermons , he refused to preach Communist propaganda , Muhammad said , eventually running into trouble with the authorities . He was stripped of his position as an imam and barred from teaching in 1997 , amid unrest roiling the region .\nWhen Muhammad left China for Saudi Arabia and Turkey in 2009 , Emer was making his living as a doctor of traditional medicine . Emer was growing old , and under heavy surveillance , he had stopped attending religious gatherings .\nThat didn \u2019 t stop authorities from detaining the imam , who is in his eighties , and sentencing him on various charges for up to 12 years in prison over 2017 and 2018 . The database cites four charges in various entries : \u201c stirring up terrorism , \u201d acting as an unauthorized \u201c wild \u201d imam , following the strict Saudi Wahhabi sect and conducting illegal religious teachings .\nMuhammad called the charges false . Emer had stopped his preaching , practiced a moderate Central Asian sect of Islam rather than Wahhabism and never dreamed of hurting others , let alone stirring up \u201c terrorism , \u201d Muhammad said .\n\u201c He used to always preach against violence , \u201d Muhammad said . \u201c Anyone who knew him can testify that he wasn \u2019 t a religious extremist . \u201d\nNone of Emer \u2019 s three sons had been convicted of a crime . But the database shows that over the course of 2017 , all were thrown into the detention camps for having too many children , trying to travel abroad , being \u201c untrustworthy \u201d or \u201c infected with religious extremism , \u201d or going on the Hajj , the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca . It also shows that their relation to Emer and their religious background was enough to convince officials they were too dangerous to let out from the detention camps .\n\u201c His father taught him how to pray , \u201d notes one entry for his eldest , Ablikim Memtimin .\n\u201c His family \u2019 s religious atmosphere is thick . We recommend he ( Emer ) continue training , \u201d says another entry for his youngest son , Emer Memtimin .\nEven a neighbor was tainted by living near him , with Emer \u2019 s alleged crimes and prison sentence recorded in the neighbor \u2019 s dossier .\nThe database indicates much of this information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques , sent to visit homes and posted in communities . This information is then compiled in a dossier called the \u201c three circles \u201d , encompassing their relatives , community , and religious background .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just the religious who were detained . The database shows that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad , getting a passport or installing foreign software .\nPharmacist Tohti Himit was detained in a camp for having gone multiple times to one of 26 \u201c key \u201d countries , mostly Muslim , according to the database . Former employee Habibullah , who is now in Turkey , recalled Himit as a secular , kind and wealthy man who kept his face free of a beard .\n\u201c He wasn \u2019 t very pious , he didn \u2019 t go to the mosque , \u201d said Habibullah , who declined to give his first name out of fear of retribution against family still in China . \u201c I was shocked by how absurd the reasons for detention were . \u201d\nThe database says cadres found Himit had attended his grandfather \u2019 s funeral at a local mosque on March 10 , 2008 . Later that year , the cadres found , he had gone to the same mosque again , once to worship and once to celebrate a festival . In 2014 he had gone to Anhui province , in inner China , to get a passport and go abroad .\nThat , the government concluded , was enough to show that Himit was \u201c certainly dangerous. \u201d They ordered Himit to stay in the center and \u201c continue training . \u201d\nEmer is now under house arrest due to health issues , his former student , Muhammad , has heard .
