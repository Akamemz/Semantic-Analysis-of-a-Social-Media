It took effect in 1995 . The idea was to abolish internal border controls and initiate a common visa policy , eliminating lines at border crossings and reducing costs to central governments . Twenty-two European Union nations and four others \u2014 Iceland , Norway , Switzerland and Liechtenstein \u2014 are now parties to the agreement .\nIn September , the president of the European Commission , Jean-Claude Juncker , called the free movement under the Schengen Agreement \u201c a unique symbol of European integration . \u201d\nBut what once seemed a sensible idea now offers real and present danger . Stolen , doctored and fake passports from the Schengen area are among the most sought-after forms of identification by terrorists , drug smugglers , human traffickers and other criminals . As of last year , eight Schengen countries were on the list of the top 10 nations reporting stolen or lost passports in Interpol \u2019 s databases . Not one of those countries systematically screened passports at their borders .\nAmong the European countries that are not parties to the Schengen Agreement is the United Kingdom , which began screening passports against Interpol \u2019 s database following the 2005 terrorist attacks there that killed 52 people and injured more than 700 . The U.K. now screens about 150 million passports a year , more than all other European Union nations combined , and catches more than 10,000 people a year trying to cross its borders using invalid travel documents .",
