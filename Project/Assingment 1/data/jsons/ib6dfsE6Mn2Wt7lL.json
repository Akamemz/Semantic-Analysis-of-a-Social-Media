With one sweeping generalization , you stated that those of us who have had successful businesses did not earn that success . Instead , you insist that someone else made it happen for us . I \u2019 ve written to tell you my story in the hopes that you will see the foolishness of your unproven assertions .\nBack in 1989 , I decided to pursue a PhD in Criminology . I was nearing the end of my Master \u2019 s program in Psychology . I had a teaching assistantship that paid a mere $ 345 per month . I knew that I could not live on $ 345 per month for the minimum of three years I would need to finish my doctorate . I also knew that my parents would not be able to extend the same financial support they had so graciously extended while I was working on my Master \u2019 s degree . So I devised a plan to start a new business with just $ 1000 of initial investment .\nMy grandfather had passed away in December of 1988 . In the late spring of 1989 , my grandmother mailed me a check for $ 1000 that had been part of a life insurance policy payout issued upon my grandfather \u2019 s death . In the late summer of 1989 , I met a graduate student by the name of Shannon Ruscoe . He had been playing tennis with my roommate Harry Wilson the day I met him . I was sitting in my living room playing a song by James Taylor when Shannon started singing along . After just a few minutes of listening to Shannon sing , I knew my life would never be the same again .\nI called Shannon later that fall and asked if he wanted to get together and rehearse a few songs . We did . Within a few weeks we were hanging out at keg parties in places like Starkville \u2019 s College Station apartment complex . After a few beers , I would go to my car and get my 12-string . As our repertoire increased , so did Shannon \u2019 s confidence as a singer .\nAfter a few months of getting to know Shannon , I laid out a plan . I found a beautiful Alvarez six-string with a cedar top and black jacaranda back and sides . I realized I could buy the guitar and install a Martin thin-line pickup under the bridge for just $ 700 . With the remaining $ 300 , I told Shannon that , for just $ 30 per night , we could rent a PA system from our friend Jim Beaty , the owner of Backstage Music in Starkville . The idea was that after playing free ten times we could start to earn a living as musicians .\nFirst , we had to find a place to play . Fortunately , a Kappa Sigma named Mike worked as a manager at J.C. Garcia \u2019 s \u2013 a Mexican restaurant/bar that featured acoustic acts including the legendary Jeff Cummings and Jeffrey Rupp . We went to see him with an offer , telling Mike we would play at J.C \u2019 s free of charge on a Tuesday night , but only on one condition : if they sold $ 2000 worth of liquor , they would have to hire us the next week for 10 % of the liquor sales , or $ 200 .\nMike laughed . J.C.s had never sold $ 2000 worth of liquor on a Tuesday night , which was generally their slowest night of the week . Naturally , he felt he had nothing to lose .
