The state \u2019 s Republican governor , Susana Martinez , and Dr. Derksen \u2013 also a Republican \u2013 were committed to standing up a robust , competitive marketplace that would be run by the state , not the federal government .\nInitially , things went pretty smoothly for this family physician and health-policy expert . Derksen , who had actually drafted part of the Affordable Care Act , had secured a first round of federal funding for the state \u2019 s marketplace exchange . He was readying his proposal for a second round of funding .\nBut as the Supreme Court moved toward a landmark ruling on the constitutionality of the law , conservative critics in the governor \u2019 s administration began to question him . With tensions mounting , Dersken handed his funding proposal to New Mexico \u2019 s secretary of human services .\n\u201c Obamacare \u2019 s not coming in the door , \u201d said the secretary , throwing his proposal on the floor and storming out of the room , according to Derksen .\nGiven the polarizing nature of the Affordable Care Act , aka \u201c Obamacare , \u201d it \u2019 s not surprising that the two main presidential candidates have opposite takes on it . Here \u2019 s a review of the law and what could happen with it .\nThe Obama administration announced Monday that consumers who buy private insurance under the law \u2019 s federal marketplace exchange will face an average 25 percent increase in premiums for a benchmark \u201c silver \u201d plan , though most people will qualify for tax credit subsidies to help pay for the price hike . It \u2019 s increasingly clear that the next president will have to address the instability of the federal exchanges .\nThe premium increases follow the exit of big private insurers and co-ops from many of the exchanges set up under Obamacare . Analysts cite several reasons for the insurer exits , including inexperience with the marketplaces , the end of certain federal support for the insurance companies , and an imbalance among those covered : too many sick participants , not enough young , healthy ones . That has been costly for private insurance companies , who have cited hundreds of millions of dollars in losses .\nAlso see The Upshot 's interactive map of where uninsured Americans live within the US at the county-level .\nNot a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in March 2010 . Two years later , conservatives challenged the law 's constitutionality in a landmark Supreme Court case , NFIB v. Sebelius . The case focused on the law \u2019 s requirement to sign up for a minimum level of health insurance or pay a financial penalty , known as the individual mandate .\nThe main question was : Does the constitution give Congress the authority to establish such a requirement ? The court examined two provisions under which Congress could claim this authority : the power to collect taxes and to regulate commerce between states . Both are found in Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution .\nThe first clause , about taxes , seems relatively straightforward : \u201c The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States\u2026 \u201d\nThe third clause , known as the Commerce Clause , gives Congress the authority to \u201c regulate commerce \u2026 among the several states. \u201d Essentially this gets to the debate over the balance of power between federal and state government , as Cornell \u2019 s Legal Information Institute explains .\nIn its June 2012 decision , the Supreme Court determined that the Commerce Clause did not provide legal justification for compelling Americans to buy a minimum level of health insurance or else face a financial penalty .\n\u201c The individual mandate\u2026 does not regulate existing commercial activity . It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product , on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce , \u201d the ruling read . \u201c Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority . \u201d\nHowever , the court upheld the individual mandate , but for a different reason : it argued that the financial penalty amounted to a tax and thus fell within the bounds of Congress 's constitutional authority .\n`` In this case \u2026 it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income , but choose to go without health insurance . Such legislation is within Congress \u2019 s power to tax , '' the ruling read .\nSubsequent Supreme Court cases challenged other aspects of the law , including whether it violates the religious liberty of employers opposed to providing contraception .\nSources : the Jill Stein campaign , the Hillary Clinton campaign website , Reuters , MSNBC , the Donald Trump campaign website , ProCon.org , Fox News , Donald Trump 's Twitter account , Politico , ISideWith.com , Ballotpedia , CNN\nLook at health care from different perspectives and discuss with people who agree and disagree with you .\nJ.
