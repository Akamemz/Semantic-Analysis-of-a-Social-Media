    "content": "Wisconsin Gov . Scott K. Walker , a prospective Republican presidential contender , said Saturday he does not know whether President Obama is a Christian . \u201c I don \u2019 t know , \u201d Walker said in an interview at the JW Marriott hotel in Washington , where he was attending the winter meeting of the National Governors Association . Told that Obama has frequently spoken publicly about his Christian faith , Walker maintained that he was not aware of the president \u2019 s religion . \u201c I \u2019 ve actually never talked about it or I haven \u2019 t read about that , \u201d Walker said , his voice calm and firm . \u201c I \u2019 ve never asked him that , \u201d he added . \u201c You \u2019 ve asked me to make statements about people that I haven \u2019 t had a conversation with about that . How [ could ] I say if I know either of you are a Christian ? \u201d\n\u201c To me , this is a classic example of why people hate Washington and , increasingly , they dislike the press , \u201d he said . \u201c The things they care about don \u2019 t even remotely come close to what you \u2019 re asking about. \u201d Walker said he did not believe that most Americans care about such matters. \u201c People in the media will [ judge ] , not everyday people , \u201d he said . \u201c I would defy you to come to Wisconsin . You could ask 100 people , and not one of them would say that this is a significant issue. \u201d After the interview was completed , Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster telephoned The Washington Post to say the governor was trying to make a point of principle by not answering such kinds of questions , not trying to cast doubt on Obama \u2019 s faith .\nDemocrats and Republicans play by different rules because the media enforces those rules , and members of the national press tend to be liberal Democrats . During the Bush years , we were often reminded , dissent was the `` highest form of patriotism . '' Over the course Obama 's tenure , dissent became dangerous , disrespectful , un-American and quite possibly racist . When a conservative figure says something that seems to impugn or question a prominent liberal 's character or love of country , `` civility '' SWAT teams are dispatched to knock down some proverbial doors . Such transgressions must n't stand . But when the dynamic is reversed , the civility police are curiously off duty . Which brings us to Rudygate . For days , the media elite have been hyperventilating into paper bags over caustic comments from a long-retired Republican mayor , who suggested that President Obama does n't love America . ( For the record , Giuliani 's assessment was demagogic and unproductive ) . By virtue of another one-sided media rule -- which stipulates that top Republicans must always answer for every single Republican-involved `` outrage '' du jour -- Rudygate has magically morphed into Walkergate . The Washington Post decided to use precious time in an exclusive interview with Gov . Scott Walker to interrogate him about Giuliani 's remarks , following up with the non sequitur question of whether he thinks Obama is a Christian . Here is the part of Walker 's response over which the Outrage Circus is sputtering and fulminating : He does n't know ? For shame ! Anything short of an immediate profession of absolute assurance regarding the contents of Barack Obama 's heart and mind is a scandal . Never mind that Hillary Clinton cagily said in 2008 that she took Obama `` at his word `` that he 's not a Muslim ; that does n't matter right now . Also irrelevant ? This portion of Walker 's answer :\nAchingly true . And the press seems intent on proving Walker 's point . Enjoy this sampling of the legacy media 's reaction to Rudy 's thoughts -- and Walker 's thoughts about Rudy 's thoughts , as well as Walker 's thoughts on the media 's thoughts about Rudy 's thoughts .
