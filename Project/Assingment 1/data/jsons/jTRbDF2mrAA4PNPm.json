    "content": "There \u2019 s been a lot of media attention recently to the changing demographics of the United States , where , at current rates , people who identify as \u201c white \u201d are expected to become a minority by the year 2050 . But in many ways , the shift in national demographics has been accelerated beyond even that . New data from the American Values Atlas shows that while white people continue to be the majority in all but 4 states in the country , white Christians are the minority in a whopping 19 states . And , nationwide , Americans who identify as Protestant are now in the minority for the first time ever , clocking in at a mere 47 percent of Americans and falling .\nThe most obvious reason for this change is growing racial diversity . Most Americans still identify as Christian , but \u201c Christian \u201d is a group that is less white and less Protestant than it has been at any time in history . The massive growth in Hispanic Catholics , in particular , has been a major factor in this shift in the ethnic and religious identity of this country . White Catholics used to outnumber Hispanic Catholics 3 to 1 in the 2000s , but now it \u2019 s only by a 2 to 1 margin .\nBut another major reason religious diversity is outpacing the growth of racial/ethnic diversity is largely due to the explosive growth in non-belief among Americans . One in five Americans now identifies as religiously unaffiliated . In 13 states , the \u201c nones \u201d are the largest religious group . Non-religious people now equal Catholics in number , and their proportion is likely to grow dramatically , as young people are by far the most non-religious group in the country . This isn \u2019 t some kind of side effect of their youth , either . As Adam Lee has noted , the millennial generation is becoming less religious as they age .\nThese changes explain the modern political landscape as well as any economic indicator . While not all white Christians are conservative , these changing numbers definitely suggest that conservative Christians are rapidly losing their grip on power . And while some non-white Christians are conservative , their numbers are not making up for what the Christian right is losing . And whether conservative leaders are aware of the exact numbers or not , it \u2019 s clear that they sense that change is in the air . Just by speaking to young people , turning on your TV , or reading the Internet , you can sense the way the country is lurching away from conservative Christian values and towards a more liberal , secular outlook . And conservative Christians aren \u2019 t taking these changes well at all .\nTo look at the Christian right now is to see a people who know they are losing power and are desperately trying to reassert dominance before it \u2019 s lost altogether . The most obvious example of this is the frenzy of anti-abortion activity in recent years . Anti-choice forces have controlled the Republican Party since the late '70s , but only in the past few years have they concentrated so singlemindedly on trying to destroy legal abortion in wide swaths of the country . In 2011 alone , states passed nearly three times as many abortion restrictions as they had in any previous year .\nNone of this is a reaction to any changes in people \u2019 s sexual behavior or reproductive choices . It \u2019 s not like there was a spike in abortions causing this panic . In fact , the abortion rate has been declining . And despite continuing media panic over adolescent sexuality , the fact is that teenagers are waiting longer to have sex , on average , than in the past . Despite this , not only are you seeing a dramatic increase in attacks on legal abortion , the Christian right has expanded its attacks to contraception access , suggesting that something has worked them into a panic they believe can only be resolved by trying to reassert their religious and sexual values .\nThat something isn \u2019 t changes in sexual behavior , but it \u2019 s reasonable to believe it \u2019 s because of changes in sexual values . People might not be having more sex , but they are feeling less guilty about the sex they are having . Since Gallup first started polling people in 2001 on moral views , acceptance of consensual sex between adults has skyrocketed . In a decade \u2019 s time , acceptance of premarital sex swelled from 53 % to 66 % of Americans and acceptance of gay Americans grew from a mere 38 % to a majority of Americans . Even polyamory has become more acceptable for Americans , rising from being accepted by 5 % of Americans to 14 % .\nThe fact that these changes in attitude are rising alongside the growth of irreligiosity is not a coincidence . More perhaps even than the 1960s , Americans are in a period of questioning rigid sexual and religious mores , and concluding , in increasing numbers , that they are not down with guilt-tripping people for victimless behavior and demanding conformity for its own sake . Some of them -- now a whopping 22 % of Americans ! -- are leaving religion entirely . Some are continuing in their faith but choosing to interpret their values differently than Christian conservatives would like .\nAnd so we see Christian conservatives cracking down in a desperate bid to regain control . They claim that they \u2019 re being oppressed by increasing tolerancefor religious diversity . They have latched onto , with some success , the claim that \u201c religious freedom \u201d requires giving Christians the right to oppress others . The Republican Party is in complete thrall to the religious right , to the point where giving the Christian right one go-nowhere symbolic bill instead of another one created a major political crisis .\nThe irony is that this panic-based overreach is just making the situation worse for the Christian right .

And they \u2019 re not just rejecting conservative Christianity but the entire idea of organized religion altogether . In other words , the past few years have created a self-perpetuating cycle : Christian conservatives , in a panic over changing demographics , start cracking down .
