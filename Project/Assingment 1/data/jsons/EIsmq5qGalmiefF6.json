    "content": "2019 brought no great surprises or \u201c black swans. \u201d But the fragile world order did move further down the path of unraveling . What to worry about in 2020 ? Some nasty disruptions may lie ahead . Here \u2019 s the top of my list of things to watch out for in 2020 :\n2020 elections : Either a Trump reelection or a victory for a Democratic challenger is bound to deepen U.S. political tribalism . A Trump victory would likely result in four more years of U.S. withdrawal from the multilateral world order and a global leadership deficit , while a narrow Trump loss could cause domestic political turmoil . A Democratic victory and left populist economic policies could also fuel uncertainty and turmoil in markets ;\nBrexit : One certainty is that Brexit will finally occur , with the United Kingdom out of the European Union by January 31 . But political and economic uncertainties abound . A U.K.-EU trade deal may drag out beyond 2020 . Brexit may lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom , as the Scottish Nationalist Party pursues another independence referendum and Irish nationalist MPs strong election performance in Northern Ireland positions them to ponder their future ; London \u2019 s global financial hub is also at risk ;\nNorth Korean defiance : This is the most immediate challenge of what seems a new nuclear age now taking shape ( e.g. , the demise of U.S.-Russia arms pacts , and Iran and Saudi Arabia as potential proliferators ) . Whether or not there is another Trump-Kim summit , as Kim offered in his New Year \u2019 s day speech , tensions are likely to rise in 2020 as Pyongyang continues developing strategic weapons . Kim escalated his blackmail efforts , again threatening a \u201c new path \u201d with powerful strategic weapons if the U.S. fails to make concessions . A fa\u00e7ade of diplomacy may continue , but Kim appears to be inching close to a strategic choice : That is the meaning of Kim \u2019 s New Year Speech \u2014 and 13 sets of ballistic missile tests since May . Despite claiming to prefer a still undefined denuclearization , Kim \u2019 s goal appears to be to buy time as he enhances his missile and nuclear arsenal . After 25 years of denuclearization diplomacy , prospects for a genuine , verifiable denuclearization appear slim to none . Kim is set to pursue the \u201c new path \u201d he warned about . This may unleash a new cycle of \u201c fire and fury \u201d rhetoric , threatening confrontation with a serious risk of conflict sparked by miscalculation . But war remains an unthinkable , catastrophic option , and mutual deterrence should hold . Next phase : How to live with a nuclear North Korea .\nThe great unraveling : With the demise of its arbitration mechanism , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) \u2013 the key enabler of 70 years of prosperity and a rules-based economic order \u2013 may also become defunct . In the best case , after a lapse of six to 24 months , a new arbitration mechanism with a much-reduced mandate and a reformed , but also diminished in scope and authority , WTO may emerge . But universal rules and enforcement will be less important in shaping the terms of trade than large countries using their market size to weaponize trade via tariffs . Meanwhile bilateral and multilateral preferential trade arrangements will take on more importance in shaping rules . The latter group \u2013 often excluding the United States \u2013 could become the new normal for global trade .\nA bifurcated world : Despite a modest U.S.-China trade deal , the decoupling of the world \u2019 s two largest economies amid growing techno-nationalism on both sides is driving a new global economic dynamic reflected in the WTO \u2019 s fate . The main elements of Beijing \u2019 s predatory mercantilism ( substantive subsidies to state-owned enterprises and \u201c national champions , \u201d \u201c digital sovereignty \u201d in pursuit of \u201c Made in China 2025 , \u201d and economic coercion of foreign investors ) remains largely undiluted . Washington is seeking to disrupt supply chains linking the United States and China , cutting off investment , scientific exchanges , and tech exports and imports from China . Decoupling will occur largely in the telecom/5G and electronics/IT sectors , and sensitive national security-related industries , resulting in a fragmented internet and e-commerce . The disruption in global innovation and supply chains will render Washington \u2019 s \u201c Indo-Pacific policy \u201d problematic . The fact that China is the number-one trading partner of all U.S. Asian allies and partners , and a top trading partner with the EU and many Latin American nations offers a preview of the costs to the U.S. of a bifurcated global economy .\nGray Swan : A China reckoning/world financial crisis : A perfect storm involving a simultaneous slowdown in the three economic centers and the U.S.-China decoupling could catapult the global economy into another deep economic crisis . China \u2019 s internal contradictions are growing , including massive public , household , and corporate debt ( 300 percent of gross domestic product ) , aging demographics ( labor shortages , pension and health care demands ) and sagging growth ( 2 to 3 percent in real terms ) . The United States also suffers from a growing debt problem at the federal government level , plus substantial corporate debt at a time of record low interest rates . The U.S. Federal Reserve worries that its fiscal and monetary instruments may not be up to the job of dealing with even just a recession . Equally , slowing growth and the EU \u2019 s divisions in the wake of its uneven recovery from the 2008 financial meltdown make it an unlikely candidate to pull the world out of a recession .\nThis is by no means , an exhaustive list , but an assessment of top risks to watch for . Overlapping conflicts in the greater Middle East \u2013 Syria , Libya , Yemen , Iran \u2013 are percolating , and proxy or real U.S. conflict with Iran is within the realm of the plausible .
