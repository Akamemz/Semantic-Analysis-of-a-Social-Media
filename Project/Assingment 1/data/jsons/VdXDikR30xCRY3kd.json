Christine Gregoire announced the passing of a voter-approved law legalizing gay marriage .\n`` For the past 20 years we 've been saying just one more step . Just one more fight . Just one more law . But now we can stop saying 'Just one more . ' This is it . We are here . We did it , '' Gregoire told a group of Referendum 74 supporters during the law 's certification .\nWashington is just the most recent of several states to pass legislation legalizing same-sex marriage , signifying a significant departure from previous thinking on the controversial subject .\nA study by the Pew Research Center on changing attitudes on gay marriage showed that in 2001 57 percent of Americans opposed same-sex marriage , while 35 percent of Americans supported it .\nThe same poll shows that today opinions have greatly shifted to reflect slightly more support for same-sex marriage than opposition -- with 48 percent of Americans in favor and 43 percent opposed .\nIn fact , just two years ago , 48 percent of Americans opposed same-sex marriage while only 42 percent supported it -- indicating that opinions have changed dramatically in the last couple of years alone .\nCheck Out Same-Sex Marriage Status in the U.S. State By State\nIt 's hard to imagine that only 16 years ago , the fervent gay marriage debate led to the conception of the Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage as a union solely held between a man and a woman .\nWhile debating the Defense of Marriage Act in September 1996 , former Sen. Robert Byrd said : `` If same-sex marriage is accepted , then the announcement will be official : America will have said that children do not need a mother and a father .
