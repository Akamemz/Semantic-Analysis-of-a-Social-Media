    "content": "With less than two weeks to go , the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump .\nThat \u2019 s within the margin of error of the national \u2588\u2588\u2588 Poll of likely voters .\nClinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent . Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided . Last week she was up by six points ( 45-39 percent ) and before that by seven ( 45-38 percent ) .\nThe poll , released Wednesday , finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup . That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin . She was up 7 a week ago ( 49-42 percent ) .\nTrump is helped by increased backing among independents and greater strength of support : 68 percent of those backing Trump support him \u201c strongly , \u201d compared to 61 percent for Clinton .\nIndependents favor Trump over Clinton by 13 points ( 41-28 percent ) . He had a 7-point advantage last week , and two weeks ago they were tied at 35 percent each . Third-party candidates play a role here , as Gary Johnson ( 14 percent ) and Jill Stein ( 7 percent ) receive the combined support of more than one-in-five independents .\nIn the four-way race , Trump leads among whites ( +14 points ) and men ( +5 ) , although his best groups remain white evangelical Christians ( +56 ) and whites without a college degree ( +28 ) .\nClinton has commanding leads among blacks ( +77 points ) , unmarried women ( +27 ) , voters under 30 ( +18 ) , and women ( +10 ) . First-time voters are also more likely to back her ( +16 ) .\nThe candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful : 83 percent of Democrats back Clinton , while 81 percent of Republicans support Trump .\n\u201c To be competitive , Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents , \u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw . \u201c That \u2019 s where he \u2019 s made in-roads in the last week , mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare. \u201d Shaw conducts the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson .\nTrump \u2019 s substantive strength is the economy . He \u2019 s trusted over Clinton by four points , yet that \u2019 s the only issue where he bests her . More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy ( +15 points ) , immigration ( +3 ) , and terrorism ( +3 ) .\nWho would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin ? More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points ( 47-44 percent among registered voters ) . That \u2019 s down from a 13-point lead on this measure in April ( 53-40 percent ) .\nAll in all , likely voters don \u2019 t think Trump is up to the task : less than half think he \u2019 s qualified to be president ( 46 percent ) and even fewer feel he has the temperament to serve effectively ( 36 percent ) . Plus , over half lack confidence in his judgment in a crisis ( 56 percent ) .\nClinton trounces Trump on each of those measures : 64 percent believe she \u2019 s qualified , 62 percent say she has the temperament , and 56 percent are confident in her judgment .\nPlus , Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings . She has a net negative rating of eight points ( 45 favorable vs. 53 unfavorable ) , while Trump is underwater by 14 ( 42 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable ) . In addition , when undecided voters and those backing third-party candidates are combined , 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs. 18 percent for Trump .\nYet despite Trump \u2019 s weaknesses on traits , it \u2019 s still a tight race . That \u2019 s because , at least in part , lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote . By a 59-28 percent margin , more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates . Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57-point margin ( 73-16 percent ) . For Clinton supporters , the choice is more about issues by 12 points ( 47-35 percent ) .\nCompared to 2008 , this is a more character driven election . At that time , voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 71-14 percent margin .\n`` The bottom has n't fallen out for Trump and Clinton has n't pulled away , but the race isn \u2019 t as close as the 3-point lead suggests , \u201d says Anderson . \u201c Trump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of third-party candidates , and that \u2019 s extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment , temperament , and qualifications to be president . ''\nThere are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched . First , 52 percent feel Clinton \u201c stands up \u201d for people like them , and 49 percent feel that way about Trump .\nAlso on their honesty -- or lack thereof : a record-low 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy , while 34 percent say Trump is .\n- 63 percent of Trump \u2019 s supporters believe things in the United States generally favor \u201c other people , \u201d rather than people like them . Forty-four percent of Clinton \u2019 s supporters feel that way .\n- Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will ( 64-26 percent ) . Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win , while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will .\n- Trump supporters ( 34 percent ) are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters ( 10 percent ) to say they won \u2019 t accept the election outcome if their candidate loses . Eighty-eight percent of Clinton supporters say they \u2019 ll accept the outcome , up from 74 percent in September .\n- The generic congressional ballot test is also tight : 47 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district , while 45 percent support the Republican . Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate , 79 percent go for Trump in the four-way presidential race . Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidate .\n\u201c Models suggest a 2-point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate , \u201d says Shaw . \u201c That means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House , while the Senate would be very much up for grabs . \u201d\n- The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters . The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points ( 51 percent favorable vs. 47 percent unfavorable ) . The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point ( 48 percent favorable vs. 49 percent unfavorable ) .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research ( D ) and Shaw & Company Research ( R ) from October 22-25 , 2016 . The survey includes results among 1,221 likely voters . The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters .",
