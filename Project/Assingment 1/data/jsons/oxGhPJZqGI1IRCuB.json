After a long news week and as several of my contemporaries lived high on the hog down in D.C. at the so-called \u201c Nerd Prom , \u201d me and my brother left D.C. to go see our Boston Red Sox play the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards I hate the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner\u2014it represents everything I think is wrong with Washington , making celebrities out of news media and politicians\u2014and given the fact I grew up just outside Boston I figured seeing the Red Sox play in Baltimore would be a great reprieve from the political culture . Boy was I wrong .\nMy brother and I arrived in Baltimore just outside Camden Yards about an hour before the game , and went into Bullpen Bar\u2014one of three iconic all-brick building bars right outside the stadium\u2014for a beer before the Sox took on the O \u2019 s . I usually make it up here for a game or two every year , and have always found Orioles fans to be pleasant . We \u2019 re united in our hatred of the Yankees .\nBullpen Bar sits between Pickles Pub and Sliders Bar & Grill . Outside each of the brick-faced bars , on the days of Orioles Games , each bar puts out barricades about 20 feet from their front doors . Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds of fans from each team\u2014the Orioles , and in the case of Saturday night , the Red Sox\u2014pack into three bars and the barricaded-off space in front before each game . Inside and outside of each , bartenders serve \u201c cheap beer \u201d \u2014or so the $ 6-per-tall-boy-cans are advertised on big signs\u2014while hotdogs , sausages and other pastime favorites are sold by each and by vendors who set up tents across the street . The blue collar culture\u2014and really friendly people\u2014are what make Baltimore baseball games so much fun , and there \u2019 s no better place to kick off an adventure into Camden Yards than here .\nBut on Saturday night , after my brother and I finished off our beers at Bullpen and began walking across the street to the stadium , planning to make our way to our seats after getting inside , chaos broke out .\nSeveral people across the street from these bars\u2014between there and the stadium , which is less than 100 yards away\u2014were holding signs that said # BlackLivesMatter . They were protesting the death of Freddie Gray , who Agence France Press newswire wrote \u201c died last Sunday from spinal injuries , a week after his arrest in the city \u2019 s impoverished west side . \u201d\n\u201c In a press conference Friday , officials acknowledged Gray should have received medical help at the moment of his arrest , when he was seen by bystanders \u2014 and caught on video \u2014 howling in apparent pain , \u201d AFP wrote , providing the background of the simmering tensions in the mid-Atlantic port town . \u201c They also revealed that Gray , contrary to police department policy , was not buckled into his seat in the van , which made at least three unexplained stops on its way to the Western District police station . Gray died Sunday with 80 percent of his spine severed at the neck , lawyers for his family have said . His funeral is scheduled for Monday . Six officers have been suspended with pay as the police investigation inches closer to a May 1 deadline to submit findings to a Maryland state prosecutor , who could decide to press charges . \u201d\nAll of a sudden\u2014literally as my brother and I walked out of Bullpen\u2014everything went haywire . What were peaceful marchers holding up signs turned into violent rioters . Innocent fans standing by were confronted by the rioters , who physically and verbally threateningly engaged many of them\u2014and then the protesters got even more violent .\nAll of a sudden , beer bottles and cans , and other projectiles were lobbed by the protesters into the crowds of fans . To get those projectiles , the protesters stole them forcibly from the bartenders and vendors set up outside each of those three bars . One beer can whizzed by my brother \u2019 s face , missing him by about six inches , and more flew all over the crowded area .\nThe crowd of protesters then stopped a blue station wagon carrying a white family as they tried to drive past Pickles , Bullpen and Sliders along a narrow one-way stretch between the bars and the main road . As a horde of them smashed their open and closed fists on the hood of the car\u2014while impeding them by standing in front of them\u2014the driver backed up on the one way pass in a desperate attempt to get out of dodge . Then , stopped on the other side with nowhere to go , protesters ripped open the passenger door of the car and began reaching around inside the vehicle . As hundreds of people looked on , including several police officers who didn \u2019 t engage the violent protesters , the white woman in the front seat\u2014middle-aged and a little heavyset with dark hair\u2014was visibly terrified . The group of black men who ripped open the car door suddenly realized they were separated from the larger group of protesters and abandoned their quest to seemingly either carjack the station wagon or rob the people inside in front of hundreds , driving out of the one-way street back onto the main road and presumably out of dodge .\nAs projectiles continued flying everywhere from each part of the crowd\u2014like a war-zone\u2014another black man then charged into the crowd of Red Sox and Orioles fans standing outside Pickles Pub and tore the metal barricades apart throwing them into the now-crowded one-way pass where the assaulted station wagon was a moment ago .\nMy brother , at this point , was screaming at the group of five or so police officers . \u201c Why aren \u2019 t you doing anything ? They \u2019 re hurting people ! They \u2019 re hurting people ! They \u2019 re violent ! \u201d he yelled at them as they continued ignoring him and not engaging or attempting to stop the violence .\nI had been trying\u2014unsuccessfully , as I never use my phone for this\u2014to capture some useful videos and photos of what was going on . My reporter gear , including an iPad I specifically use for the purpose of covering this kind of thing , was back in my apartment just outside D.C. and I really never take photos or video with my phone . After I went back through them later , in the middle of the chaos , they all came out blurry and unusable .\nNonetheless , fearing for my safety and for my brother \u2019 s safety , at this point I grabbed him and pulled him aside\u2014and said \u201c we need to go , we need to go into the stadium . \u201d\nWe moved along as fast as we could around Camden Yards to get inside\u2014Orioles officials had closed down several gates that are normally open so we had to go almost halfway around the place to get in\u2014and got through the gate as I Tweeted updates of what I saw and what went down so hopefully other media would pull through and cover the violence that was going on .

I asked one of them if we were allowed to leave , and they said no . We were , along with the 15,000 or so still in the stadium , being forcibly kept there by the Baltimore mayor \u2019 s authority .
