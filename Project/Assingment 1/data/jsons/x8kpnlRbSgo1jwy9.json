    "content": "In the big-picture conversation around the 2016 presidential election , the major negative narratives about Donald Trump have tended to focus on his racism , his temperament , or his tendency to tell lies .\nYet there \u2019 s another important Trump trait that \u2019 s gotten some attention but really needs to get much more \u2014 he \u2019 s corrupt , and in a consistent way .\nWhenever Trump has been in positions of power or authority , he has demonstrated a pattern of trying to enrich himself by abusing the trust others have placed in him \u2014 whether it \u2019 s creditors , contractors , charitable givers , Trump University students , regulators , or campaign donors .\nOver the past several months \u2014 and , indeed , the past few decades \u2014 reporters have unearthed many alarming stories that show this . They \u2019 ve reported on Trump \u2019 s many shady business practices . His shady charity . His shady fake university scam . His shady campaign spending . His many shady associates . And , last but by no means least , there is Trump \u2019 s refusal to release tax returns or other financial information that would shed further light on his business practices , associates , and philanthropic undertakings .\nNow , sometimes Trump \u2019 s abuses of trust entail breaking the law , and sometimes they \u2019 re within the bounds of the law . And sometimes the legality of Trump \u2019 s actions isn \u2019 t yet clear \u2014 as in the case of Trump University , which will face a fraud trial shortly after the election , and with some of the controversies around the Trump Foundation .\nBut the common thread is that Trump screws people over to benefit himself . And despite the plethora of excellent reporting on this topic , many voters seem to be unaware of his troubling history here , and may view him primarily as a successful businessman who says some offensive things . A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , for instance , found that Trump had a 10-point advantage over Clinton on \u201c being honest and straightforward . \u201d\nIndeed , he is betting his campaign on his hopes that he can frame himself as an independent outsider free of special interest influence , to contrast with Hillary Clinton , whom he has dubbed \u201c crooked . \u201d\nBut Trump \u2019 s record makes it crystal clear that he \u2019 s more interested in rapaciously extracting what money he can and doing what he wants , with little regard to laws , rules , or people who aren \u2019 t Donald Trump . Furthermore , he \u2019 s repeatedly proven willing to violate norms about what sort of behavior is acceptable and ethical .\nAnd most importantly of all , if elected president , Trump would wield incredible power . Yet if you look at what he \u2019 s done with power in the past , suddenly this theme in his biography \u2014 his corruption \u2014 becomes among the most troubling of his many troubling qualities . There are many , many reasons to be concerned about a Trump administration \u2019 s ethics and potential to abuse power . Here are just a few .\nFirst off , the way Trump has run his businesses for the past few decades should raise grave doubts about how he \u2019 d run the federal government \u2014 he \u2019 s allegedly been willing to break rules , break promises , and discriminate against nonwhite people .\nThere are the hundreds of accusations that Trump refused to pay contractors and workers what they were owed , which the Wall Street Journal and USA Today compiled this year . \u201c The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump \u2019 s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals , then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years , \u201d USA Today \u2019 s Steve Reilly wrote . \u201c In some cases , the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents , draining their resources. \u201d ( Trump told Reilly that if he ever didn \u2019 t pay , it must have been because he was unhappy with the work . )\nAnd recently , Republican consultant Brian James Walsh further corroborated these accusations with his own personal story :\nTrue story - my Dad 's company was stiffed by Trump on a six figure telecom job in the 1980 's . Trump told them it would cost more to sue him . \u2014 Brian Walsh ( @ brianjameswalsh ) September 27 , 2016\nNext , there \u2019 s the housing discrimination case against him from the 1970s . The Department of Justice alleged that Trump and his father discriminated against black applicants for apartments in Trump-owned buildings . One superintendent said he had been instructed to write \u201c C \u201d ( for \u201c colored \u201d ) on every application from a prospective black tenant , and others described similar racial \u201c codes , \u201d as the Daily Beast \u2019 s Gideon Resnick has written .\nThe government argued that black applicants would repeatedly be told there were no vacancies in Trump-owned buildings , but white applicants would then inquire and get offers . The Trumps denied the claims and fought back in court , but eventually settled \u2014 \u201c with no admission of guilt , \u201d Trump pointed out during Monday \u2019 s debate , which is not exactly saying he was innocent .\nThen there was Trump \u2019 s illegal financial maneuver back in 1986 . That year , he tried to take over two rival casino companies by buying up their stock . But the law required him to disclose his large purchases to the Federal Trade Commission in advance , and he failed to do so . The matter ended up in court , and he was eventually forced to pay a $ 750,000 penalty as a result .\nAnd there \u2019 s the matter of Trump \u2019 s alleged contacts with the mob . Now , to be fair to the GOP nominee , the Mafia \u2019 s influence was pervasive in the New York City construction industry at the time . Still , when reputed mobster Robert LiButti was a high-dollar gambler at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City , the Trump Plaza worked very hard indeed to keep him happy , as Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News reported :\nWhen LiButti demanded that women or black card dealers not be allowed on his games , the Trump Plaza kept them away from him \u2014 and it was later fined $ 200,000 for violating state nondiscrimination laws .\nThe Trump Plaza also gave LiButti nine luxury cars as gifts , all of which he quickly exchanged for a total of $ 1.65 million in cash . But cash gifts from casinos to high rollers were then illegal in the state , so the Trump Plaza was slapped with another fine \u2014 this one for $ 450,000 .\nLiButti was wiretapped bragging that he was \u201c very close with \u201d Trump and that he rode in Trump \u2019 s helicopter .\nAnd Trump \u2019 s reputed mob contacts didn \u2019 t stop there . \u201c I \u2019 ve covered Donald Trump off and on for 27 years , and in that time I \u2019 ve encountered multiple threads linking Trump to organized crime , \u201d reporter David Cay Johnston wrote in Politico Magazine in May . \u201c No other candidate for the White House this year has anything close to Trump \u2019 s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters , swindlers , and other crooks . \u201d\nTrump has used other people \u2019 s donations to his charity to benefit himself\nDonald Trump has a charitable family foundation to which , in recent years , he has given hardly any money , instead raising the vast majority of its funds from others . That \u2019 s rather dishonest of him , since he constantly claims that the foundation \u2019 s donations are from his own pocketbook . But the more serious problem is that he \u2019 s then used several hundred thousand dollars of that foundation money in deeply questionable ways that may well have run afoul of laws against \u201c self-dealing \u201d with charity money .\nFor instance , in September , the Washington Post \u2019 s David Fahrenthold \u2014 the reporter who \u2019 s absolutely owned the Trump Foundation beat \u2014 reported that Trump used $ 258,000 of the foundation \u2019 s money to settle legal problems involving his for-profit businesses .\nFirst , in 2007 , Trump \u2019 s Mar-a-Lago club was fined $ 120,000 by the town of Palm Beach , Florida , because the height of its flagpole violated town rules . An eventual settlement entailed the town waiving the fines and Trump committing to donate $ 100,000 to a veterans charity . But Trump used his foundation , not any of his businesses , to make the donation .\nSecond , in 2010 , a guy named Martin Greenberg sued Trump \u2019 s golf course , claiming he was cheated out of a promised million-dollar prize for getting a hole in one during a charity tournament . The golf course agreed to settlement in which it would donate to Greenberg \u2019 s charitable foundation \u2014 but the $ 158,000 sent over was instead from the Trump Foundation , not any of Trump \u2019 s businesses .\nAgain , what Trump seems to have done here is used other people \u2019 s charity donations to get his own businesses off the hook for lawsuits . Which seems ... pretty corrupt . ( The Trump campaign sent out a statement that attacked Fahrenthold but did not dispute any facts in his story . )\nAnd eventually , Farenthold found another bombshell . Businessman Richard Ebers bought almost $ 1.9 million worth of goods and services from Trump or his businesses , but he was told to pay Trump \u2019 s tax-exempt foundation instead , according to Fahrenthold \u2019 s sources . But according to the law , Trump should have paid taxes on that money as income \u2014 and his campaign refuses to say whether he did so .\nAnd those are just the latest Trump Foundation controversies . Fahrenthold has also reported on an illegal $ 25,000 donation the foundation made to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi \u2019 s political group around the time she was weighing whether to investigate Trump University , for which the foundation was hit with an IRS penalty . ( The Trump campaign claims this was a mistake . ) There was also that time Trump spent $ 12,000 of the foundation \u2019 s money to buy a football helmet autographed by Tim Tebow , plus a jersey , at a charity auction . And much more .\nLaw professor Adam Chodorow writes in Slate writes that all this , together , seems to indicate Trump is using his tax-exempt charity as a \u201c personal piggy bank. \u201d He continues that the foundation should likely \u201c lose its tax-exempt status \u2019 and \u201c Trump arguably should report the money it spent on his behalf as income , \u201d adding : \u201c If I worked at the Internal Revenue Service , I would refer Trump to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation. \u201d Another law professor , Philip Hackney , makes a similar argument at The Surly Subgroup blog .\nRepeatedly during the campaign , Trump has admitted that he has been \u201c greedy \u201d in business \u2014 but he \u2019 s argued that as president , he would channel that trait to benefit the American people . \u201c I want to grab all that money . I \u2019 m going to be greedy for the United States , \u201d he \u2019 s said .\nIt \u2019 s a dubious claim , made even more dubious by his behavior in the matter of Trump University . This was the GOP nominee \u2019 s seminar business that purported to be able to teach its students secrets of real estate investing . Former students sued Trump , claiming they were bilked out of their money , and he \u2019 s set to face a trial for fraud in the matter shortly after the election . The New York attorney general \u2019 s office has also sued , claiming Trump University made deceptive claims .\n`` [ The instructors ] were unqualified people posing as Donald Trump 's 'right-hand men , ' '' Jason Nicholas , a former employee , said in one deposition . `` They were teaching methods that were unethical , and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals . It was a fa\u00e7ade , a total lie . ''\nThe business model was , apparently , to try to hook the gullible with a free seminar and pressure them into signing up for more and more expensive installments that promised to teach students how to invest in real estate .\nBut these \u201c classes \u201d were , apparently , worthless . `` To my knowledge , not a single consumer who paid for a Trump University seminar program went on to successfully invest in real estate based upon the techniques that were taught , '' former employee Ronald Schnackenberg said in another deposition . Read Libby Nelson for more .\nTrump won \u2019 t release his tax returns , which is unprecedented for a recent presidential candidate\nEvery major party nominee in the past three decades has released his or her tax returns . But Donald Trump is still refusing to do so , and is giving a nonsensical justification for it .\nTrump says he won \u2019 t release his returns because he \u2019 s currently under an IRS audit . But as the IRS has confirmed , being audited doesn \u2019 t mean he has to keep his returns secret . Furthermore , Trump has many previous years of tax returns that are no longer being audited that he could release \u2014 but he refuses to .\nSo there has naturally been a lot of speculation on what Trump is trying to hide here . Do the returns show he \u2019 s not as rich as he says he is ? That he \u2019 s given far less to charity than he claims ? That he \u2019 d rarely even paid taxes ? That he has a lot of money offshore ?\n\u201c How much tax is Trump paying or sheltering domestically vs. in foreign jurisdictions ? That needs to be known to ascertain which nations Trump has financial ties to and where he may be susceptible to pressure , \u201d Richard Painter and Norm Eisen write at the Washington Post . Until Trump releases his returns , we won \u2019 t know .\nTrump has spent millions of dollars of campaign funds on Trump businesses\nAs of August , the Trump campaign had allotted 7 percent of its total spending so far \u2014 more than $ 8.2 million \u2014 to companies owned by Trump or his children , according to an analysis by Politico \u2019 s Ken Vogel . Payments went to various Trump venues , an aviation company Trump owns , Trump Tower for office space , his corporate staff , and various other vendors .\nNow , it \u2019 s not as if Trump should have donated his company \u2019 s stuff for free \u2014 indeed , that would have been a prohibited corporate contribution . And the Trump campaign tends to respond by emphasizing that Trump put $ 54 million of his own money into the campaign . Still , he has deliberately chosen to spend his campaign money ( which includes millions raised from other people ) on companies he or his children own rather than on independent vendors .\nMeanwhile , taxpayers are chipping in too \u2014 the US Secret Service has paid $ 1.6 million to travel on a plane operated by one of Trump \u2019 s companies , according to another report by Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf . Again , Secret Service reimbursement to a campaign for travel is common . But as the authors write , since Trump owns the aviation company , \u201c the government is effectively paying him . \u201d\nAnd about that Trump Tower rent \u2014 shortly after the Trump campaign shifted from a largely self-funded model to one more reliant on donors , Trump nearly quintupled the rent that Trump Tower was charging the campaign for office space , according to the Huffington Post \u2019 s S.V . D\u00e1te . This came at a time when the campaign didn \u2019 t expand its staff size , though Trump \u2019 s team later told CNN that they were paying for two new floors \u201c in anticipation of more staff . \u201d\nDonald Trump has surrounded himself with shady people during this campaign\nThroughout the campaign , Trump has claimed not only that he would be an excellent president but that he \u2019 d be excellent at hiring . \u201c I \u2019 m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people , \u201d he said last year .\nInstead , he has surrounded himself with people who \u2019 ve not only demonstrated a history of unethical behavior but also abused their past power , often to try to intimidate critics or opponents .\nTrump appointed New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie to head his transition , giving him a key role in recommending candidates for hundreds if not thousands of federal jobs . Yet two of Christie \u2019 s job appointees in New Jersey are currently facing trial for their involvement in the Bridgegate scandal \u2014 prosecutors say they conspired to cause a serious traffic jam in Fort Lee , New Jersey , to punish the town \u2019 s mayor for refusing to endorse Christie \u2019 s reelection campaign . Another aide , David Wildstein , has already pled guilty in the matter .\nFurthermore , prosecutors also asserted in court in September \u2014 and Wildstein testified \u2014 that Christie knew about both his aides \u2019 actions and their motivations while the scheme was being carried out . ( Christie has long denied this . ) Wildstein tesitfied that he bragged to Christie about what he was doing when he saw him at an event , and that Christie laughed and responded with jokes .\nCraziest of all , Donald Trump himself has long said that Christie \u201c totally knew about \u201d his aides \u2019 actions in Bridgegate . Yet this suspicion that Christie was fine with his aides \u2019 abuse of power in a petty revenge plot seems to have been no obstacle for Trump in his determination that Christie is the best-qualified person to help him staff the federal government .\nAnother current Trump adviser is Roger Ailes , who was pushed out of his job as CEO of Fox News just in July over allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women , which , if true , is clearly an abuse of power . ( Ailes denied the allegations , but some of his harassing comments were caught on tape , according to New York magazine \u2019 s Gabriel Sherman , and Fox settled with accuser Gretchen Carlson for the hefty sum of $ 20 million . )\nFurthermore , while at Fox News , Ailes also used company money to try to orchestrate smear campaigns against journalists from other outlets who were reporting on him . Yet according to BuzzFeed News \u2019 s McKay Coppins , Ailes is \u201c playing a much larger backstage role in handling Trump than most people realize . \u201d\nAnd then there is Jared Kushner , Trump \u2019 s son-in-law , who by some accounts has effectively been running the Trump campaign for a few months . Kushner is a real estate heir who took over his father \u2019 s company after his father was sent to prison for tax evasion , making illegal campaign contributions , and witness tampering . When Kushner \u2019 s holdings ran into some financial trouble in the wake of the economic crisis , he asked fellow mogul Richard Mack for a write-down on a loan Mack had extended him \u2014 but Mack refused .\nNot long afterward , Kushner apparently wanted revenge on Mack , and he sought to get it by using the newspaper he owned \u2014 the New York Observer . Kushner had heard a rumor about Mack , and he wanted his reporters to publish a story about it . \u201c There 's a guy named Richard Mack , and we 've got to get this guy , \u201d Kushner told one reporter , according to Esquire \u2019 s Vicky Ward . Reporters were put on the case and failed to corroborate the rumor , but Kushner kept pushing to move the story forward anyway , as the Observer \u2019 s then-editor , Elizabeth Spiers , recounts . It never saw the light of day , but it \u2019 s deeply concerning about how Kushner operates .\nWhat \u2019 s most troubling of all , though , is that Trump is surely aware of everything I \u2019 ve mentioned in this section but doesn \u2019 t seem to mind . He puts a man whose appointees are facing trial in charge of government appointments . He invites an alleged serial sexual harasser who tries to intimidate critical journalists to be a key adviser . This should set off alarm bells .\nTrump \u2019 s corruption is a threat to our norms of governance\n\u201c Americans pride themselves on our politicians ' respect for the rule of law , on the checks and balances that protect us from the powerful , \u201d Ezra Klein wrote earlier this year . \u201c But as often as not , our real protection is found not in laws but in norms . \u201d\nAnd that \u2019 s the deeper problem underlying all this \u2014 that Trump has repeatedly shown he has little respect for norms of ethical or acceptable behavior .\nThere \u2019 s been much discussion about how Trump has repeatedly violated political norms of acceptable behavior \u2014 with his proposed Muslim ban , his constant vicious attacks on critics , his attempts to discredit a judge because he happens to be Mexican-American , and countless other actions .\nBut his decades-long track record in the business sector and the nonprofit world , and his management of his current campaign , suggests he \u2019 s willing to violate ethical norms too . He treats rules or laws as inconveniences . He ignores conflicts of interest . He takes what he wants , regardless of who gets hurt . And all this is when he is simply a wealthy businessman .\nYet if Trump wins in November , he becomes the most powerful person in the world , with a nuclear arsenal , the US military , and thousands of government appointees who can carry out his wishes at his disposal .\nNo one can say for sure what will happen then . But we can \u2019 t say we weren \u2019 t warned .",

And much more.\n\nLaw professor Adam Chodorow writes in Slate writes that all this, together, seems to indicate Trump is using his tax-exempt charity as a \u201cpersonal piggy bank.\u201d He continues that the foundation should likely \u201close its tax-exempt status\u2019 and \u201cTrump arguably should report the money it spent on his behalf as income,\u201d adding: \u201cIf I worked at the Internal Revenue Service, I would refer Trump to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation.\u201d Another law professor, Philip Hackney, makes a similar argument at The Surly Subgroup blog.\n\nTrump University is facing a fraud trial\n\nRepeatedly during the campaign, Trump has admitted that he has been \u201cgreedy\u201d in business \u2014 but he\u2019s argued that as president, he would channel that trait to benefit the American people. \u201cI want to grab all that money. I\u2019m going to be greedy for the United States,\u201d he\u2019s said.\n\nIt\u2019s a dubious claim, made even more dubious by his behavior in the matter of Trump University. This was the GOP nominee\u2019s seminar business that purported to be able to teach its students secrets of real estate investing. Former students sued Trump, claiming they were bilked out of their money, and he\u2019s set to face a trial for fraud in the matter shortly after the election. The New York attorney general\u2019s office has also sued, claiming Trump University made deceptive claims.\n\n\"[The instructors] were unqualified people posing as Donald Trump's 'right-hand men,'\" Jason Nicholas, a former employee, said in one deposition. \"They were teaching methods that were unethical, and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals. It was a fa\u00e7ade, a total lie.\"\n\nThe business model was, apparently, to try to hook the gullible with a free seminar and pressure them into signing up for more and more expensive installments that promised to teach students how to invest in real estate.\n\nBut these \u201cclasses\u201d were, apparently, worthless. \"To my knowledge, not a single consumer who paid for a Trump University seminar program went on to successfully invest in real estate based upon the techniques that were taught,\" former employee Ronald Schnackenberg said in another deposition. Read Libby Nelson for more.\n\nTrump won\u2019t release his tax returns, which is unprecedented for a recent presidential candidate\n\nEvery major party nominee in the past three decades has released his or her tax returns. But Donald Trump is still refusing to do so, and is giving a nonsensical justification for it.\n\nTrump says he won\u2019t release his returns because he\u2019s currently under an IRS audit. But as the IRS has confirmed, being audited doesn\u2019t mean he has to keep his returns secret. Furthermore, Trump has many previous years of tax returns that are no longer being audited that he could release \u2014 but he refuses to.\n\nSo there has naturally been a lot of speculation on what Trump is trying to hide here. Do the returns show he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is? That he\u2019s given far less to charity than he claims? That he\u2019d rarely even paid taxes? That he has a lot of money offshore?\n\n\u201cHow much tax is Trump paying or sheltering domestically vs. in foreign jurisdictions? That needs to be known to ascertain which nations Trump has financial ties to and where he may be susceptible to pressure,\u201d Richard Painter and Norm Eisen write at the Washington Post. Until Trump releases his returns, we won\u2019t know.\n\nTrump has spent millions of dollars of campaign funds on Trump businesses\n\nAs of August, the Trump campaign had allotted 7 percent of its total spending so far \u2014 more than $8.2 million \u2014 to companies owned by Trump or his children, according to an analysis by Politico\u2019s Ken Vogel. Payments went to various Trump venues, an aviation company Trump owns, Trump Tower for office space, his corporate staff, and various other vendors.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not as if Trump should have donated his company\u2019s stuff for free \u2014 indeed, that would have been a prohibited corporate contribution. And the Trump campaign tends to respond by emphasizing that Trump put $54 million of his own money into the campaign. Still, he has deliberately chosen to spend his campaign money (which includes millions raised from other people) on companies he or his children own rather than on independent vendors.\n\nMeanwhile, taxpayers are chipping in too \u2014 the US Secret Service has paid $1.6 million to travel on a plane operated by one of Trump\u2019s companies, according to another report by Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf. Again, Secret Service reimbursement to a campaign for travel is common. But as the authors write, since Trump owns the aviation company, \u201cthe government is effectively paying him.\u201d\n\nAnd about that Trump Tower rent \u2014 shortly after the Trump campaign shifted from a largely self-funded model to one more reliant on donors, Trump nearly quintupled the rent that Trump Tower was charging the campaign for office space, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s S.V. D\u00e1te. This came at a time when the campaign didn\u2019t expand its staff size, though Trump\u2019s team later told CNN that they were paying for two new floors \u201cin anticipation of more staff.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has surrounded himself with shady people during this campaign\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has claimed not only that he would be an excellent president but that he\u2019d be excellent at hiring. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\u201d he said last year.\n\nInstead, he has surrounded himself with people who\u2019ve not only demonstrated a history of unethical behavior but also abused their past power, often to try to intimidate critics or opponents.\n\nTrump appointed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to head his transition, giving him a key role in recommending candidates for hundreds if not thousands of federal jobs. Yet two of Christie\u2019s job appointees in New Jersey are currently facing trial for their involvement in the Bridgegate scandal \u2014 prosecutors say they conspired to cause a serious traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey, to punish the town\u2019s mayor for refusing to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection campaign. Another aide, David Wildstein, has already pled guilty in the matter.\n\nFurthermore, prosecutors also asserted in court in September \u2014 and Wildstein testified \u2014 that Christie knew about both his aides\u2019 actions and their motivations while the scheme was being carried out. (Christie has long denied this.) Wildstein tesitfied that he bragged to Christie about what he was doing when he saw him at an event, and that Christie laughed and responded with jokes.\n\nCraziest of all, Donald Trump himself has long said that Christie \u201ctotally knew about\u201d his aides\u2019 actions in Bridgegate. Yet this suspicion that Christie was fine with his aides\u2019 abuse of power in a petty revenge plot seems to have been no obstacle for Trump in his determination that Christie is the best-qualified person to help him staff the federal government.\n\nAnother current Trump adviser is Roger Ailes, who was pushed out of his job as CEO of Fox News just in July over allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women, which, if true, is clearly an abuse of power. (Ailes denied the allegations, but some of his harassing comments were caught on tape, according to New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman, and Fox settled with accuser Gretchen Carlson for the hefty sum of $20 million.)\n\nFurthermore, while at Fox News, Ailes also used company money to try to orchestrate smear campaigns against journalists from other outlets who were reporting on him. Yet according to BuzzFeed News\u2019s McKay Coppins, Ailes is \u201cplaying a much larger backstage role in handling Trump than most people realize.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who by some accounts has effectively been running the Trump campaign for a few months. Kushner is a real estate heir who took over his father\u2019s company after his father was sent to prison for tax evasion, making illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. When Kushner\u2019s holdings ran into some financial trouble in the wake of the economic crisis, he asked fellow mogul Richard Mack for a write-down on a loan Mack had extended him \u2014 but Mack refused.\n\nNot long afterward, Kushner apparently wanted revenge on Mack, and he sought to get it by using the newspaper he owned \u2014 the New York Observer. Kushner had heard a rumor about Mack, and he wanted his reporters to publish a story about it. \u201cThere's a guy named Richard Mack, and we've got to get this guy,\u201d Kushner told one reporter, according to Esquire\u2019s Vicky Ward. Reporters were put on the case and failed to corroborate the rumor, but Kushner kept pushing to move the story forward anyway, as the Observer\u2019s then-editor, Elizabeth Spiers, recounts. It never saw the light of day, but it\u2019s deeply concerning about how Kushner operates.\n\nWhat\u2019s most troubling of all, though, is that Trump is surely aware of everything I\u2019ve mentioned in this section but doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He puts a man whose appointees are facing trial in charge of government appointments. He invites an alleged serial sexual harasser who tries to intimidate critical journalists to be a key adviser. This should set off alarm bells.\n\nTrump\u2019s corruption is a threat to our norms of governance\n\n\u201cAmericans pride themselves on our politicians' respect for the rule of law, on the checks and balances that protect us from the powerful,\u201d Ezra Klein wrote earlier this year. \u201cBut as often as not, our real protection is found not in laws but in norms.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the deeper problem underlying all this \u2014 that Trump has repeatedly shown he has little respect for norms of ethical or acceptable behavior.\n\nThere\u2019s been much discussion about how Trump has repeatedly violated political norms of acceptable behavior \u2014 with his proposed Muslim ban, his constant vicious attacks on critics, his attempts to discredit a judge because he happens to be Mexican-American, and countless other actions.\n\nBut his decades-long track record in the business sector and the nonprofit world, and his management of his current campaign, suggests he\u2019s willing to violate ethical norms too. He treats rules or laws as inconveniences. He ignores conflicts of interest. He takes what he wants, regardless of who gets hurt. And all this is when he is simply a wealthy businessman.\n\nYet if Trump wins in November, he becomes the most powerful person in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, the US military, and thousands of government appointees who can carry out his wishes at his disposal.\n\nNo one can say for sure what will happen then. But we can\u2019t say we weren\u2019t warned.\n\nDonald Trump hates lies, but can't tell the truth",
