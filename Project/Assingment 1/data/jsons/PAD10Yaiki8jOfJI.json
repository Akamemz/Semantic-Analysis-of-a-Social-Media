For months , FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has been considering a \u201c hybrid \u201d approach to Internet regulation , one in which the government would regulate the relationships between content companies ( such as Netflix ) and Internet service providers ( such as Verizon ) , but in which the consumer side of things would be essentially left alone . Then on Monday , President Obama came out strongly for full net neutrality on Monday , issuing a statement that calls on the Federal Communications Commission to reclassify wired and wireless broadband Internet as a \u201c common carrier \u201d service subject to strict government oversight .\nThe FCC is an independent agency , so Mr. Wheeler and the other Commissioners aren \u2019 t required to go along with the President \u2019 s plan . But how might the FCC balance such a strong statement in favor of net neutrality with the more cautious plans it has been exploring for the past several months ?\nMr. Wheeler released a response on Monday that provides some insight . First , he says , the President and the FCC agree on the basics : the Internet should be an open platform in which no players are advantaged over others ( this means no \u201c fast lanes \u201d for those able to pay for content to be delivered more quickly ) .
