    "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s administration is working on yet another anti-LGBTQ policy , the New York Times reported over the weekend .\nAccording to Erica Green , Katie Benner , and Robert Pear at the Times , Trump \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) is considering an interpretation of Title IX , the federal civil rights law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded schools , that \u201c would define sex as either male or female , unchangeable , and determined by the genitals that a person is born with. \u201d ( This would defy the scientific and medical evidence embraced by major organizations like the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association . )\nHHS is the primary agency working on the draft proposal , but other agencies , including the departments of Education , Justice , and Labor , are expected to adopt it as well should the administration move forward with the change . It \u2019 s not clear when that will be , although the Times reported that HHS \u201c is preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year . \u201d\nThe proposal would effectively erase protections for trans people , who identify with a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth , from federal civil rights laws \u2014 ensuring that the laws do not prohibit discrimination against trans people in any setting , including the workplace , housing , schools , and health care .\nHHS has refused to comment on \u201c alleged leaked documents , \u201d CNN reported . Civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocacy organizations , meanwhile , have suggested that they will take the administration to court should it move forward with the change .\nThe move would be far from the first time that the Trump administration has taken action that hurts LGBTQ people . For much of the past couple of years , the administration has been mired in court battles over its attempts to ban transgender people from the military after the Obama administration lifted the original ban . And different parts of the Trump administration have already taken steps to prevent federal civil rights protections from applying to trans and gay people .\nThe anti-LGBTQ agenda stands in sharp contrast with Trump \u2019 s rhetoric on the campaign trail . The then-candidate held up a Pride flag at a campaign event , and he vowed to work for \u201c L , G , B , T \u2026 Q \u201d people at the 2016 Republican convention . Instead , Trump \u2019 s administration has done a lot to undermine LGBTQ \u2014 and particularly trans \u2014 rights .\nOne reason the Trump administration \u2019 s latest proposal is even possible : Under federal and most states \u2019 laws , discrimination against LGBTQ people , based on sexual orientation and gender identity , is not explicitly prohibited . The exclusion of LGBTQ people is a big hole in civil rights laws , which generally ban discrimination based on race , sex , and religion , among other protected categories .\nThis means that it \u2019 s not explicitly illegal for someone to be fired from a job , evicted from a home , or kicked out of a business just because an employer , landlord , or business owner doesn \u2019 t approve of the person \u2019 s sexual orientation or gender identity .\nBut civil rights advocates have long argued that federal law should already shield LGBTQ people from discrimination because , they say , bans on discrimination on the basis of sex should also bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity .\nAccording to advocates , discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is fundamentally rooted in prohibited sex-based expectations . For example , if someone discriminates against a gay man , that \u2019 s largely based on the expectation that a man should only love or have sex with a woman \u2014 a belief built on the idea of what a person of a certain sex should be like .\nSimilarly , if someone discriminates against a trans woman , that \u2019 s largely based on the expectation that a person designated male at birth should identify as a man \u2014 again , a belief built on the idea of what a person of a certain sex assigned at birth should be like .\nOn the other side , opponents argue that LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections aren \u2019 t included in existing federal civil rights laws , because the authors of federal civil rights laws never believed or intended that bans on sex discrimination also ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity . ( This is the Trump administration \u2019 s position . )\nLGBTQ advocates , citing legal precedent , say that what the original laws \u2019 authors believe or intended is irrelevant . Joshua Block , an attorney with the ACLU LGBT and HIV Project , cited a 1998 Supreme Court case , Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services Inc. , in which the Court unanimously agreed that bans on sex discrimination prohibit same-sex sexual harassment . Sexual harassment between people of the same sex was not something the authors of federal civil rights laws considered , but it \u2019 s something , the Supreme Court said , that a plain reading of the law protects .\n\u201c Oncale says that \u2019 s irrelevant whether [ Congress ] contemplated it , \u201d Block previously told me . \u201c This is literal sex discrimination . Whether or not that \u2019 s what Congress was focused on doesn \u2019 t make it any less a type of discrimination covered by the statute . \u201d\nThe Obama administration generally embraced this argument for trans people , interpreting federal civil rights protections \u2014 including those that ban discrimination in the workplace , housing , education , and health care \u2014 to apply to trans people , although not gay people . Most controversially , the administration took this to apply to school bathrooms and locker rooms , releasing a guidance that asked federally funded schools to let trans students use the facility that corresponded with their gender identity instead of the gender assigned to them at birth .\nSeveral courts have also accepted this interpretation of federal law , though the US Supreme Court has yet to validate it .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s move , however , would declare that federal sex discrimination bans do not cover trans people . This would not only flip the Obama administration \u2019 s move to protect trans people but would also attempt to apply the anti-trans interpretation across the entire federal government from this point forward . If allowed by the courts , that would ensure that future implementation of federal civil rights laws leaves trans people behind .\nIt would , however , be far from the first anti-LGBTQ step the Trump administration has taken .\nThe Trump administration has adopted a host of anti-LGBTQ actions over much of the past couple of years . Here are some of the major examples :\nThe administration \u2019 s anti-LGBTQ agenda even extends to more minor issues , such as Trump \u2019 s refusal to acknowledge LGBTQ Pride Month .\nAll of the moves amount to a comprehensive agenda \u2014 one that , short of actual legislation , has taken nearly every step possible to undermine the rights of LGBTQ people .\nOn the campaign trail , Trump said he would be different \u2014 the first Republican president to embrace LGBTQ people . He posed with the Pride flag and acknowledged \u201c L , G , B , T \u2026 Q \u201d people . He initially defended the right of Caitlyn Jenner , a transgender woman , to use the bathroom that aligns with her gender identity . He tweeted , in reference to a mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando , Florida , \u201c Thank you to the LGBT community ! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs . \u201d\nThere were warning signs , though . Trump had surrounded himself with people , like Pence and Sessions , who have long histories of opposition to LGBTQ people . And when the Obama administration put out a guidance protecting trans people in federally funded schools ( including in bathrooms and locker rooms ) , Trump vowed to do away with the guidance .\nSo the bulk of LGBTQ advocates never fell for the nice-sounding rhetoric .\nAs president , Trump has proven the skepticism right , establishing the types of policies one would expect from a typical anti-LGBTQ Republican president . Maybe that reflects his own opinions . Or maybe it reflects the views of the people he \u2019 s surrounded himself with in his administration .\nWhatever the cause , the result is Trump \u2019 s presidency and administration have now adopted a broad anti-LGBTQ agenda \u2014 one that has gone after LGBTQ workers , students , troops , and patients . And more than showing Trump \u2019 s dishonesty , this agenda potentially threatens the rights of millions of LGBTQ Americans .\n\u201c People debate , \u2018 Does he personally like or dislike LGBT people ? \u2019 That \u2019 s irrelevant , \u201d James Esseks , director of the ACLU \u2019 s LGBT and HIV Project , previously told me , reflecting on the administration \u2019 s first year . \u201c He has put in place people who have firmly anti-LGBT agendas , and he \u2019 s not just enabled but endorsed those agendas himself .
