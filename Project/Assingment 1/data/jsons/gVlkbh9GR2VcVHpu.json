''\nIn case the Obamas don \u2019 t know what class is , Lauten is just the gal to show them .\n\u201c At least respect the part that you play . Then again your mother and father don \u2019 t respect their positions very much , or the nation for that matter , so I \u2019 m guessing you \u2019 re coming up a little short in the \u2018 good role model \u2019 department . \u201d\nSweet , right ?

Dress like you deserve respect , not a spot at a bar . And certainly don \u2019 t make faces during televised , public events . \u201d\nFor the record , they wore skirts and sweaters and rolled their eyes when their dad made a corny joke . Straight to reform school they go .\nShockingly , people reacted negatively to Lauten \u2019 s letter . I mean , she was just saying . So , she did what any reasonable person would do . She prayed . And she asked her mommy and daddy what she should do , because they are very good role models .
