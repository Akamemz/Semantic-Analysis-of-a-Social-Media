Not so much .\nHow exactly did the Left romanticize the Lost Cause Confederacy , and by extension its secession and efforts to preserve slavery ?\nWell before the end of Jim Crow , post-war leftist Hollywood still largely continued its soft mythologies of the Confederate Lost Cause . Perhaps the cinematic romance arose because of the lucrative fumes of earlier Gone with the Wind fantasies , which themselves might \u2019 ve come from an understandable desire to play a part in \u201c binding up the nation \u2019 s wounds . \u201d\nIn George Stevens \u2019 s mythic Shane ( 1953 ) , the tragedy of the post\u2013Civil War heroic gunslinger seems eerily tied to his past as an against-the-odds ex-Reb . In contrast , the movie \u2019 s odious villain , Unionist Jack Wilson , is a hired gun and company man ( brilliantly portrayed by then newcomer Jack Palance ) .\nWilson shows off his bought cred by gunning down a na\u00efve southern sodbuster , \u201c Stonewall \u201d Torrey ( played by Elisha Cook Jr. ) , accompanied by slurs about the Confederacy . ( \u201c I \u2019 m saying that Stonewall Jackson was trash himself . Him and Lee and all the rest of them Rebs . You too . \u201d )\nIn the movie \u2019 s final shootout , replaying the Civil War provides the catalyst for more violence . This time Shane \u2014 and the heroic South \u2014 wins for good , with a payback Civil War exchange with Wilson :\nShane : I \u2019 ve heard about you , Jack Wilson . Wilson : What have you heard , Shane ? Shane : I \u2019 ve heard that you \u2019 re a low-down Yankee liar . Wilson : Prove it .\nWilson is then blown back across the barroom under a hail of bullets . Even out on the Wyoming range , the Hollywood subtext is that sodbuster homesteaders can find a former Confederate loser to protect them , with courage and chivalry , against the northern corporatists trying to steamroll them . The noble savior Shane , we are assumed to believe , had no part in slavery or insurrection but was fighting for his southern soil in service to the Confederacy .\nPart of the dark mystery and tragedy of John Ford \u2019 s anti-hero Ethan Edwards in The Searchers originates in Edwards \u2019 s edgy Lost Cause mettle \u2014 and acts of bravery that never seem to result in his own positive outcome . His prior stint with the Confederacy is alluded to not just to remind the audience of his unrepentant side but also to emphasize the origins of Edwards \u2019 s formidable skills , doggedness , and principles \u2014 especially valuable in times ( and only during such times ) when frontier law fails and such assets are necessary , even if acquired in nihilist service to the losing side .\nJohn Ford drew on that Confederate romance of noble opponents in several films , from Stagecoach ( 1939 ) to The Horse Soldiers ( 1959 ) . A common theme is audacity fueled by admirable past loyalty to a bad cause , a key ingredient in classic portraits of the tragic hero from Homer to Erwin Rommel .\nHollywood Westerns \u2014 often in the 1950s and early 1960s \u2014 increasingly saw in the Confederate romance a way of reuniting the country , and they partook of the leftist pushback against a federal establishment . Indeed , it is hard to watch a Western in which a southern officer is portrayed purely negatively . At worst , they are daydreamers plotting to rebuild a western confederacy ( Rio Conchos ) . At best , they play into the stereotypes that the better fighters of the South lost the war only because of overwhelming industrial output and manpower of the North \u2014 and thus former Confederates are especially valuable Indian fighters on the frontier , a safe space for them that is the United States but not the North .\nThe True Grit movies have a larger-than-life Rooster Cogburn character , an anti-hero and former member of the Quantrill Raiders , the pro-Confederate rangers \u2019 gang that included Jesse and Frank James . John Wayne first portrayed Cogburn in 1969 , in a finale to his earlier southern roles in John Ford \u2019 s cavalry movies .\nIn 1969 \u2019 s The Good , The Bad and The Ugly , Clint Eastwood mastered the art of portraying Confederates as noble opponents , especially in a haunting scene of an oppressive Union POW camp overseen by a psychopathic criminal commandant , set to the moving lyrics of Ennio Morricone \u2019 s \u201c Story of a Soldier . \u201d\nEastwood later went the full Confederate , in The Outlaw Josey Wales ( 1976 ) . The former son of the South , Wales becomes a 1970s cowboy version of Dirty Harry , serving as a jack-of-all-trades multiculturalist equalizer \u2014 fighting back against vicious northern red-leg marauders and in behalf of abandoned women , the poor , and Native Americans .\nThe supposedly left-wing 1960s and 1970s , in fact , were the heyday of Confederate Chic . True , there were plenty of In the Heat of the Night portraits of the now-familiar racist white Neanderthals , but with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and the end of Jim Crow segregation , the romance of the Old South reappeared , updated and tweaked for the era of counterculture protest .\nThe hippie style of long hair , beards and mustaches , resistance to government authority , twangy folk-song strains , and hard-edged metal all fed into the rural , down-home Confederate romance .\nThe contemporary hippie style of long hair , beards and mustaches , resistance to government authority , twangy folk-song strains , and hard-edged metal all fed into the rural , down-home Confederate romance . Notions of slavery , segregation , and secession mysteriously disappeared . Southern attitude was no longer Bull Connor but airbrushed Sixties-era resistance , at least at the superficial level of pop culture .\nIn Walter Hill \u2019 s post-Vietnam The Long Riders ( 1980 ) , the murderous Jesse James gang morphs into a sort of mix of Lynyrd Skynyrd with Bonnie and Clyde \u2014 noble outlaws fighting the grasping northern banks and the railroad companies \u2019 \u201c Pinkerton Men. \u201d David Carradine and his siblings , playing members of the gang , appear like Woodstock rockers , with exaggerated southern accents , long unkempt hair , hippie buckskin , and a don \u2019 t-give-a-damn Bay Area resistance attitude .\nWhen a clueless Unionist musician is caught in a cathouse playing \u201c The Battle Cry of Freedom \u201d ( \u201c Rally Round the Flag , boys \u201d ) , a Younger brother ( Randy Quaid ) in the gang forces him to substitute \u201c I \u2019 m a Good Old Rebel , \u201d sung by no less than California hipster Ry Cooder . The lyrics are unabashedly treasonous :\nI hate the Yankee nation And everything they do . I hates the Declaration of Independence too . I hates the glorious Union \u2019 Tis dripping with our blood . And I hates their striped banner . I fought it all I could .\nThe tough verses today might earn a Southern Poverty Law Center\u2013driven boycott of the film \u2019 s soundtrack , or a visit from Antifa .\nAn earlier melodic and hit rendition of Robbie Robertson \u2019 s ( of The Band ) \u201c The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down , \u201d sung by civil-rights activist Joan Baez , helped resurrect and mainstream Baez \u2019 s folk career . But Robertson \u2019 s song is about the Union \u2019 s slashing and burning its way through the sacred ground of the empathetic and slave-owning South \u2014 it \u2019 s an unapologetic and romantic defense of Confederate rebellion :\nLike my father before me , I will work the land And like my brother above me , who took a Rebel stand . He was just 18 , proud and brave , but a Yankee laid him in his grave . I swear by the mud below my feet , You can \u2019 t raise a Caine back up when he \u2019 s in defeat . The night they drove old Dixie down , and the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down , and all the people were singing They went , \u201c Na , la , na , la , na , na , na , na , na , na , na , na , na , na . \u201d\nThe unlikely common denominator that brought together left-wing Sixties popular culture with Confederate cool was a mutual hatred of a supposedly big , square , soulless , and powerful Washington , hated for its insolence in Vietnam and for stifling the individual \u2014 as if the poor lost South had been once as defenseless as the Vietnamese in the face of such a godless steamroller , or as if the Carradine clan were like the Allman Brothers with six-shooters .\nSouthern pop-music angst , hard metal , and crossover country and western channeled southern and Confederate themes , supposedly adding authenticity to mostly mainstream northern suburban American pop .
