''\nHolmes described a dramatic shift at the embassy in March 2019 , noting U.S. foreign policy `` became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted '' by Trump 's personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , and a `` cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House . ''\nHe recounted former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch 's clashes with former prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko over the U.S. push for anti-corruption in Kyiv . Lutsenko retaliated by launching a smear campaign against Yovanovitch , Holmes said , with the help of Giuliani and his associates , who would later begin to take `` a direct role '' in Ukrainian policy .\nHe said he recalled Sondland saying , `` Damnit Rudy . Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f -- -s everything up . \u201d\nHill described her final confrontation with Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , as a difference over their priorities between domestic and foreign-affairs purposes , under questioning from Republican staff lawyer Steve Castor .\nAs they sat down with two others during her final week in July , Hill said she was upset because of their different priorities .\n\u201c I was very much upset , \u201d Hill said . \u201c I unfortunately had a bit of a blow up with Ambassador Sondland . \u201d\nHill said after listening to Sondland \u2019 s testimony Wednesday that she realized why they weren \u2019 t cooperating . Sondland was meeting with President Donald Trump , acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to urge Ukraine to investigate whether energy company Burisma meddled in the 2016 election . But Hill said the National Security Council was working on foreign affairs rather than domestic politics .\n\u201c When he wasn \u2019 t cooperating , it was because we weren \u2019 t doing the same thing that he was doing , \u201d Hill said . \u201c It struck me he was absolutely right because he was being involved in a domestic political errand . And we were involved in national security foreign policy . \u201d\nHill said Sondland was right that he had been given a different directive from Trump than then-National Security Adviser John Bolton .\n\u201c I was irritated with him because he wasn \u2019 t coordinating , \u201d Hill said . \u201c I did say to him that I think this is all going to blow up . \u201d\nAfter more than five hours of testimony Thursday , Fiona Hill demonstrated a powerful sense of humor in addition to her former post at the National Security Council .\nHill had testified about being threatened during 2017 and having her personal information published after she became a key figure in the House impeachment inquiry . Rep. Jackie Speier , D-Calif. , asked about a childhood story .\n\u201c I understand that you were 11 years old and there was a schoolboy who set your pigtails on fire , \u201d Speier said . \u201c You were taking a test . You turned around and snuffed out the fire and proceeded to finish the test . \u201d\n\u201c It is a true story , \u201d Hill said . \u201c I was little surprised to see that pop up today . It \u2019 s one of the stories that I occasionally tell . It had some very unfortunate consequences afterward . My mother gave me a bowl haircut . \u201d\nHill told lawmakers she did not \u201c relate any concerns in general terms '' about the judgement of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman , in response to a question from Republican counsel Steve Castor .\n\u201c I was somewhat surprised when I heard ( Timothy ) Morrison make that assertion when I read his deposition , \u201d she said . \u201c These are personnel issues , and I \u2019 m sure no one here would like their private personnel issues put before the committee . \u201d\nRepublicans on the committee have argued that Vindman , a National Security Council expert on Ukraine , might be an unreliable witness because of Morrison \u2019 s criticism of him in his deposition . Morrison , NSC senior director for Europe and Russia , had said \u201c I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 's judgment \u201d in his deposition and said Hill shared his concerns .\nHill asserted her evaluation of Vindman had centered more on how he might handle a \u201c highly charged and partisan issue \u201d rather than his \u201c overall judgement \u201d or expertise .\nFiona Hill 's opening statement : Read the full text of Fiona Hill 's opening statement in impeachment hearing\nRead David Holmes ' opening statement : Read the full opening statement from David Holmes in public impeachment hearing\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement regarding today 's testimony .\n`` As has been the case throughout the Democrats ' impeachment sham , today 's witnesses rely heavily on their own presumptions , assumptions and opinions . These two witnesses , just like the rest , have no personal or direct knowledge regarding why U.S. aid was temporarily withheld , '' she said .\nGrisham also slammed Democrats for `` being motivated by a sick hatred for President Trump and their rabid desire to overturn the 2016 election . ''\nIt was unclear whether President Donald Trump was watching Thursday 's hearings , but he did have lunch with Republican senators who could end up as jurors in an impeachment trial in the upper chamber , including Sens . Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins on Maine .\nHill described to the committee the July 10 meeting at the White House with Ukrainian officials that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton abruptly ended . Hill wanted to describe the meeting because Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador the European Union , testified Wednesday that he wasn \u2019 t aware that anyone was upset at the time .\nHill said Bolton was trying to steer the conversation to subjects such as reforming the Ukraine energy sector and setting up a national security council in Ukraine , but that U.S. officials knew that Ukrainians would ask for a White House meeting for their president .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not part of Ambassador Bolton \u2019 s world to start pulling out schedule , \u201d Hill said . \u201c This was already an uncomfortable issue . \u201d\nBolton doesn \u2019 t typically set schedules for meetings and tried to steer the conversation away , she said .\n\u201c Ambassador Sondland leaned in and said , \u2018 Well , we have an agreement . There will be a meeting , subject to investigations. \u2019 That \u2019 s when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen , \u201d said Hill , who was sitting behind Bolton . \u201c For me , that was unmistakable body language that caught my attention . \u201d\nHill later learned that Sondland and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had agreed to a meeting in exchange for a Ukraine investigation into Burisma , the energy company that employed Hunter Biden , the son of the former vice president . After reporting what she learned to Bolton , he told her to report the situation to John Eisenberg , senior counsel for the National Security Council .\n\u201c He basically said , \u2018 You tell Eisenberg that I \u2019 m not part of whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up , \u2019 \u201d Hill said . \u201c I took it to mean investigations for a meeting . \u201d\nAfter a week of impeachment inquiry hearings , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said the evidence outlined thus far shows that Trump \u201c used his office for his own personal gain \u201d and his conduct was \u201c shredding the fabric of our democracy . \u201d\nPelosi , at her weekly news conference , did not provide any timeline for where the inquiry goes after today \u2019 s hearing , which is the last publicly scheduled event announced by the House Intelligence Committee .\nShe noted that today \u2019 s hearing wasn \u2019 t \u201c finished yet \u201d and that the testimony could lead to additional witnesses that the committee might want to call , which has happened throughout the inquiry .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t made any decision yet , \u201d Pelosi said about whether articles would be drawn up .\nBut , Pelosi did say that despite testimony from U.S . Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that implicated key White House officials in the inquiry , the House would not wait on the courts to decide whether these officials would have to testify before lawmakers .\nThroughout her remarks , the Speaker used some of her strongest words yet on Trump .\n\u201c His behavior is beneath the dignity of the presidency , of the office that he holds and the oath of office that he took , \u201d Pelosi said . \u201c And by the way , a very bad example for our children in the manner in which he behaves . \u201d\nHill , who said she has listened to a number of presidential phone calls , found the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201c surprising. \u201d Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son , Hunter , who worked at Ukraine energy company , during the conversation .\n\u201c I found this particular call subject matter and the way it was conducted surprising , \u201d Hill said .\nHill had testified in her closed-door deposition that she was \u201c quite shocked \u201d by the call . Hill said Thursday that reaction was \u201c because of the nature of the discussion , the juxtaposition of the issues , \u201d which didn \u2019 t include discussion items of interest between the U.S. and Ukraine that had been prepared by the National Security Council staff .\nGiuliani was a 'hand grenade who was going to blow everyone up '\nHill recalled a conversation with then-National Security Advisor John Bolton in which they discussed Giuliani 's efforts to influence U.S. policy in Ukraine . Bolton `` looked pained , '' she said , and indicated with body language that there was nothing they could do about it .\nShe previously testified that Bolton told her Giuliani `` was a hand grenade who was going to blow everyone up . ''\nWhen Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman asked her to explain what he meant , Hill said the allegations Giuliani was making were `` pretty explosive , '' noting that he was `` frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks '' and `` pushing forward issues and ideas that would , you know , probably come back to haunt us . ''\n`` In fact I think that 's where we are today , '' she said .\nFiona Hill , the former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia , told lawmakers in her opening statement that it was a mistake to think that Ukraine and not Russia had interfered with the 2016 election , as President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans have suggested .\n\u201c Based on questions and statements I have heard , some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country\u2014and that perhaps , somehow , for some reason , Ukraine did , \u201d Hill said . \u201c This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves . The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016 . This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies , confirmed in bipartisan Congressional reports . \u201d\nHill compared the Russian interference under President Vladimir Putin to a political-action committee in the United States funded by millions of dollars .\nThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes .\n\u201c President Putin and the Russian security services operate like a Super PAC , \u201d Hill said . \u201c They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives . \u201d\nHill , a native of England who became a U.S. citizen in 2002 , described herself as a non-partisan who was interested in helping the committee find the truth rather than pursue a political agenda .\n\u201c I take great pride in the fact that I am a nonpartisan foreign policy expert , who has served under three different Republican and Democratic presidents . I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction , except toward the truth , \u201d Hill said .\nIn response to questions from Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , Hill described how Russians meddled in the 2016 election and would try to delegitimize the U.S. presidency , whether Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been elected .\n\u201c If former Sen. Clinton had been elected as president , as indeed many had expected before the election in 2016 , she too would have had major questions about her legitimacy , \u201d Hill said . \u201c This is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for . They seed misinformation . They seed doubt . \u201d\nHill , who was born in England and became a U.S. citizen , compared Russians to bookies in the United Kingdom who would bet on all candidates and then work to undermine the winner .\n\u201c They would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics , \u201d Hill said .\nHolmes recounted that the day after Trump 's ill-fated phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , he met with Zelensky aides and witnessed a phone call between Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , and the American president at an outdoor restaurant in Kyiv . The pair discussed A $ AP Rocky 's detention in Sweden as well as whether Zelensky was going to open the investigations Trump had requested . Sondland said `` he 's gon na do it , '' adding that Zelensky will do `` anything you ask him to . ''\nHolmes said he told his direct supervisor , the deputy chief of mission , and others at the embassy about the call .\nAsked by Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman how he knew Trump had called Sondland on July 26 , Holmes said Trump was \u201c loud \u201d and \u201c distinctive . \u201d\n\u201c It was quite loud . The person who came on was quite distinctive , \u201d Holmes said .\nHolmes described and imitated how Trump was so loud on the phone that Sondland held the phone away from his ear .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career , \u201d Holmes said , adding that the \u201c colorful language \u201d and discussion of issues he had been working on made the moment distinctive to him .\nHolmes also recalled the embassy in Kyiv 's efforts to try to unfreeze the U.S. military aid to Ukraine , noting that by August `` my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the President either as an expression of dissatisfaction that the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigation or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so . ''\nHolmes said in early September Ambassador Bill Taylor , the top diplomat in Ukraine who replaced Yovanovitch , told him that there was a request that Zelensky commit to the investigation on CNN . He described it as `` a demand that President Zelenskyy personally commit , on a cable news channel , to a specific investigation of President Trump \u2019 s political rival . ''\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , opened the third day of public impeachment hearings Thursday by reminding the room of yesterday 's testimony from Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who delivered lengthy testimony Wednesday on hi role in pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate President Donald Trump 's political rivals .\nSchiff then introduced David Holmes and Fiona Hill , noting their concerns over the `` increasing prominence '' of Rudy Giuliani , the president 's personal lawyer , in U.S.-Ukraine relations . Schiff also placed both Hill and Holmes at key moments throughout the Ukraine saga , including a July 10 meeting at the White House between Ukrainian and U.S. officials as well as Sondland 's July 26 phone call with Trump in Kyiv .\nSchiff reiterated that members of Congress would determine in the coming days whether Trump `` abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections , if he sought to condition , coerce , extort , or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts . ''\nRep. Devin Nunes , the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee , denounced the \u201c carousel of accusations \u201d levied by Democrats at President Donald Trump .\nRep. Devin Nunes , the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee , denounced the `` carousel of accusations '' levied by Democrats at President Donald Trump .\n\u201c How do we have an impeachable offense here , when there \u2019 s no actual misdeed , \u201d he said in his opening statement on Thursday\nHe urged Americans to consider the credibility of the Democrats and slammed a \u201c sham impeachment process . \u201d\nHe directly responded to Hill \u2019 s opening statement , which had said some members of the Intelligence Committee did not believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election .\nNunes submitted a report by House Republicans that warned of election interference by all countries , including Russia .\n\u201c Needless to say it is not impossible for two countries to meddle in a election at the same time , '' he said .\nMore : 'Rudy was the guy : ' Takeaways from Sondland 's testimony detailing Ukraine pressure campaign\nIn her closed-door testimony on Oct. 14 , Hill outlined key players in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Trump 's political rivals .\nAccording to Hill , U.S . Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u2019 s conduct was \u201c comical \u201d but \u201c deeply concerning , \u201d because , she said , he gave out her personal phone number and told officials to contact her and Bolton with no notice .\n\u201c It 's like basically driving along with no guardrails and no GPS on an unfamiliar territory , \u201d Hill said , calling him a counterintelligence risk .\nTimothy Morrison , Hill 's successor at the National Security Council , said Hill described Sondland to him as the `` Gordon problem . ''\nMore : How well does Trump know $ 1 million donors like Gordon Sondland ? Some are now his employees\nShe also described how concerned national security adviser John Bolton was by the linkage of aid and investigations . When Sondland brought up investigations up during a meeting between American and Ukrainian officials on July 10 , Hill said he told her it was like a `` drug deal '' and urged her to brief National Security Council lawyers .\nHill said she was `` shocked '' by Trump 's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n`` I sat in an awful lot of calls , and I have not seen anything like this . And I was there for two and a half years , '' Hill said . `` So I was just shocked . ''\nIn his closed-door testimony on Nov. 15 , Holmes shed light on a July 26 call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked him about the status of `` investigations . ''\nHolmes told lawmakers and staff behind closed doors , `` I then heard President Trump ask , 'So , he 's gon na do the investigation ? ' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he 's gon na do it , ' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to . ' ''\nDuring that conversation , Sondland told Trump that Zelensky \u201c loves your a -- \u201d and would do \u201c anything you ask him to \u201d about investigations .\n`` I 've never seen anything like this , someone calling the President from a mobile phone at a restaurant , and then having a conversation of this level of candor , colorful language , '' Holmes said .\nIn his Wednesday testimony , Sondland said he did not dispute Holmes ' characterization of the call .\n`` That 's how President Trump and I communicate , a lot of four-letter words ; in this case three-letter , '' Sondland told lawmakers .",

After reporting what she learned to Bolton, he told her to report the situation to John Eisenberg, senior counsel for the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cHe basically said, \u2018You tell Eisenberg that I\u2019m not part of whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up,\u2019\u201d Hill said. \u201cI took it to mean investigations for a meeting.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nPelosi: Trump is 'shredding the fabric of our democracy'\n\nAfter a week of impeachment inquiry hearings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the evidence outlined thus far shows that Trump \u201cused his office for his own personal gain\u201d and his conduct was \u201cshredding the fabric of our democracy.\u201d\n\nPelosi, at her weekly news conference, did not provide any timeline for where the inquiry goes after today\u2019s hearing, which is the last publicly scheduled event announced by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nShe noted that today\u2019s hearing wasn\u2019t \u201cfinished yet\u201d and that the testimony could lead to additional witnesses that the committee might want to call, which has happened throughout the inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decision yet,\u201d Pelosi said about whether articles would be drawn up.\n\nBut, Pelosi did say that despite testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that implicated key White House officials in the inquiry, the House would not wait on the courts to decide whether these officials would have to testify before lawmakers.\n\nThroughout her remarks, the Speaker used some of her strongest words yet on Trump.\n\n\u201cHis behavior is beneath the dignity of the presidency, of the office that he holds and the oath of office that he took,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAnd by the way, a very bad example for our children in the manner in which he behaves.\u201d\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nHill: Trump-Zelensky call 'surprising'\n\nHill, who said she has listened to a number of presidential phone calls, found the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201csurprising.\u201d Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked at Ukraine energy company, during the conversation.\n\n\u201cI found this particular call subject matter and the way it was conducted surprising,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill had testified in her closed-door deposition that she was \u201cquite shocked\u201d by the call. Hill said Thursday that reaction was \u201cbecause of the nature of the discussion, the juxtaposition of the issues,\u201d which didn\u2019t include discussion items of interest between the U.S. and Ukraine that had been prepared by the National Security Council staff.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nGiuliani was a 'hand grenade who was going to blow everyone up'\n\nHill recalled a conversation with then-National Security Advisor John Bolton in which they discussed Giuliani's efforts to influence U.S. policy in Ukraine. Bolton \"looked pained,\" she said, and indicated with body language that there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nShe previously testified that Bolton told her Giuliani \"was a hand grenade who was going to blow everyone up.\"\n\nWhen Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman asked her to explain what he meant, Hill said the allegations Giuliani was making were \"pretty explosive,\" noting that he was \"frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks\" and \"pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us.\"\n\n\"In fact I think that's where we are today,\" she said.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nHill: Ukraine election interference is 'fictional narrative'\n\nFiona Hill, the former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, told lawmakers in her opening statement that it was a mistake to think that Ukraine and not Russia had interfered with the 2016 election, as President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans have suggested.\n\n\u201cBased on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country\u2014and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThis is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan Congressional reports.\u201d\n\nHill compared the Russian interference under President Vladimir Putin to a political-action committee in the United States funded by millions of dollars.\n\nMore:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\n\nThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin and the Russian security services operate like a Super PAC,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives.\u201d\n\nHill, a native of England who became a U.S. citizen in 2002, described herself as a non-partisan who was interested in helping the committee find the truth rather than pursue a political agenda.\n\n\u201cI take great pride in the fact that I am a nonpartisan foreign policy expert, who has served under three different Republican and Democratic presidents. I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction, except toward the truth,\u201d Hill said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nHill: Russia tried to delegitimize presidency\n\nIn response to questions from Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Hill described how Russians meddled in the 2016 election and would try to delegitimize the U.S. presidency, whether Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been elected.\n\n\u201cIf former Sen. Clinton had been elected as president, as indeed many had expected before the election in 2016, she too would have had major questions about her legitimacy,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThis is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for. They seed misinformation. They seed doubt.\u201d\n\nHill, who was born in England and became a U.S. citizen, compared Russians to bookies in the United Kingdom who would bet on all candidates and then work to undermine the winner.\n\n\u201cThey would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics,\u201d Hill said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nHolmes on Trump phone call with Sondland\n\nHolmes recounted that the day after Trump's ill-fated phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he met with Zelensky aides and witnessed a phone call between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and the American president at an outdoor restaurant in Kyiv. The pair discussed A$AP Rocky's detention in Sweden as well as whether Zelensky was going to open the investigations Trump had requested. Sondland said \"he's gonna do it,\" adding that Zelensky will do \"anything you ask him to.\"\n\nHolmes said he told his direct supervisor, the deputy chief of mission, and others at the embassy about the call.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nHolmes: Trump was 'loud' and 'distinctive' on phone\n\nAsked by Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman how he knew Trump had called Sondland on July 26, Holmes said Trump was \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cdistinctive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was quite loud. The person who came on was quite distinctive,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nHolmes described and imitated how Trump was so loud on the phone that Sondland held the phone away from his ear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career,\u201d Holmes said, adding that the \u201ccolorful language\u201d and discussion of issues he had been working on made the moment distinctive to him.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nHolmes on military aid hold\n\nHolmes also recalled the embassy in Kyiv's efforts to try to unfreeze the U.S. military aid to Ukraine, noting that by August \"my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the President either as an expression of dissatisfaction that the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigation or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so.\"\n\nHolmes said in early September Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine who replaced Yovanovitch, told him that there was a request that Zelensky commit to the investigation on CNN. He described it as \"a demand that President Zelenskyy personally commit, on a cable news channel, to a specific investigation of President Trump\u2019s political rival.\"\n\n--Courtney Subramanian\n\nSchiff places Holmes and Hill in Ukrainian saga\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., opened the third day of public impeachment hearings Thursday by reminding the room of yesterday's testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who delivered lengthy testimony Wednesday on hi role in pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate President Donald Trump's political rivals.\n\nSchiff then introduced David Holmes and Fiona Hill, noting their concerns over the \"increasing prominence\" of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, in U.S.-Ukraine relations. Schiff also placed both Hill and Holmes at key moments throughout the Ukraine saga, including a July 10 meeting at the White House between Ukrainian and U.S. officials as well as Sondland's July 26 phone call with Trump in Kyiv.\n\nSchiff reiterated that members of Congress would determine in the coming days whether Trump \"abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts.\"\n\nNunes slams impeachment hearings\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, denounced the \u201ccarousel of accusations\u201d levied by Democrats at President Donald Trump.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, denounced the \"carousel of accusations\" levied by Democrats at President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHow do we have an impeachable offense here, when there\u2019s no actual misdeed,\u201d he said in his opening statement on Thursday\n\nHe urged Americans to consider the credibility of the Democrats and slammed a \u201csham impeachment process.\u201d\n\nHe directly responded to Hill\u2019s opening statement, which had said some members of the Intelligence Committee did not believe that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nNunes submitted a report by House Republicans that warned of election interference by all countries, including Russia.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say it is not impossible for two countries to meddle in a election at the same time,\" he said.\n\nMore:'Rudy was the guy:' Takeaways from Sondland's testimony detailing Ukraine pressure campaign\n\nWhat Hill has said\n\nIn her closed-door testimony on Oct. 14, Hill outlined key players in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Trump's political rivals.\n\nAccording to Hill, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s conduct was \u201ccomical\u201d but \u201cdeeply concerning,\u201d because, she said, he gave out her personal phone number and told officials to contact her and Bolton with no notice.\n\n\u201cIt's like basically driving along with no guardrails and no GPS on an unfamiliar territory,\u201d Hill said, calling him a counterintelligence risk.\n\nTimothy Morrison, Hill's successor at the National Security Council, said Hill described Sondland to him as the \"Gordon problem.\"\n\nMore:How well does Trump know $1 million donors like Gordon Sondland? Some are now his employees\n\nShe also described how concerned national security adviser John Bolton was by the linkage of aid and investigations. When Sondland brought up investigations up during a meeting between American and Ukrainian officials on July 10, Hill said he told her it was like a \"drug deal\" and urged her to brief National Security Council lawyers.\n\nHill said she was \"shocked\" by Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"I sat in an awful lot of calls, and I have not seen anything like this. And I was there for two and a half years,\" Hill said. \"So I was just shocked.\"\n\nWhat Holmes has said\n\nIn his closed-door testimony on Nov. 15, Holmes shed light on a July 26 call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked him about the status of \"investigations.\"\n\nHolmes told lawmakers and staff behind closed doors, \"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\"\n\nDuring that conversation, Sondland told Trump that Zelensky \u201cloves your a--\u201d and would do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d about investigations.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this, someone calling the President from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language,\" Holmes said.\n\nIn his Wednesday testimony, Sondland said he did not dispute Holmes' characterization of the call.\n\n\"That's how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words; in this case three-letter,\" Sondland told lawmakers.",
