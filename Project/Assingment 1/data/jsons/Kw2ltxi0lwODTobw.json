    "content": "This story appears in the June 2020 print edition of Rolling Stone .\nIn late April Marko Kolanovic , a financial analyst for JPMorgan Chase , wrote to clients with good news . Pandemic aside , investors should expect stock prices in S & P 500 companies to return to record numbers some time early next year !\n\u201c The S & P 500 should attain previous all-time highs , \u201d Kolanovic wrote , \u201c if the monetary measures are sustained . \u201d\nThe key part of this phrase was the last bit , \u201c if the monetary measures are sustained. \u201d In countries that did not have a Federal Reserve Bank shooting a bazooka of cash daily at Wall Street , Kolanovic suggested the coronavirus would result in a 30 percent decline in the present value of earnings .\nIn other words , without intervention by the Federal Reserve , the United States in the coronavirus era would be looking at a Depression-level contraction .\nAssuming the Fed bazooka keeps firing , however , a large portion of the investor class is already on a road leading back to champagne and confetti . And that , as Robert Frost would say , has made all the difference .\nOn the road more traveled , on the real side of the coronavirus economy , the pain has been historic . As of this writing , 30 million people have filed jobless claims during the COVID-19 crisis , and millions have lost their employer-based insurance .\nAt least one in three can \u2019 t make their rent , millions more can \u2019 t afford groceries , and workers in supermarkets , medical clinics , warehouses , and other professions are now in a macabre race to see if they \u2019 ll turn blue and die before corporate employers decide to slash their salaries or retirement benefits \u2014 which has already happened to front-line caregivers in some cities .\nThere are no projections of record earnings in the futures of such people . The best case is survival , and the grim reality of diminished economic horizons . Yet for the tiny sliver of people whose fortunes depend not on salaries , tips , and commissions , but upon the prices of financial products like stocks and bonds , the coronavirus response heralds a brave new world .\nThe $ 2.3 trillion CARES Act , the Donald Trump-led rescue package signed into law on March 27th , is a radical rethink of American capitalism . It retains all the cruelties of the free market for those who live and work in the real world , but turns the paper economy into a state protectorate , surrounded by a kind of Trumpian Money Wall that is designed to keep the investor class safe from fear of loss .\nThis financial economy is a fantasy casino , where the winnings are real but free chips cover the losses . For a rarefied segment of society , failure is being written out of the capitalist bargain .\nThis is a fresh take on a long-developing dynamic . Dating to the late Eighties , when then-Fed-chief Alan Greenspan slashed interest rates after the 1987 stock-market crash , there \u2019 s been an understanding that the government would be there to help Wall Street back on its feet in hard times .\nThat belief was so strong it had a name : the \u201c Greenspan put. \u201d Bloomberg \u2019 s Tim Duy defines the term as \u201c the implied promise that central bankers led by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would bail out market participants who indulged in risky behavior . \u201d\nThe Fed stepped in to flood Wall Street with cash ( these are called \u201c liquidity injections \u201d ) after a series of messes in the Clinton and Bush years , from the Asian-currency debacle to the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in the late Nineties to a deflation panic in 2002 .\nA prolonged period of liquidity injection in the early 2000s prompted a now-familiar pattern of pushing investors out of traditional safe-haven investments ( the low interest rates punished savers ) and into ever-riskier gambles in commodities , stocks , and the housing markets .\nAll three arenas saw bubbles , but the one in the U.S. housing market burst after an orgy of Ponzi-style scheming sent mortgage prices shooting through the roof . In the space of a few months in 2008 , the pension funds and municipalities that had been urged by greed-sick bankers to invest in a \u201c real estate boom \u201d ( actually a fraud-driven speculative bubble ) lost fortunes .\nTaxpayers and homeowners bore nearly 100 percent of the pain . Nearly 3 million people filed for foreclosure in 2010 alone . Back then , the notion of using state funds to rescue these folks was rejected as laughable , a dangerous \u201c moral hazard. \u201d As billionaire Charlie Munger put it in 2010 , homeowners needed to \u201c suck it in and cope , \u201d and not wait for a handout .\nWall Street , though , got the mother of all rescues . The response wasn \u2019 t limited to a traditional liquidity injection . Banks were given trillions in bailouts and emergency loans , allowed to dump years of bad investment decisions into special garbage facilities set up by the Federal Reserve , and urged to \u201c drink themselves sober \u201d through years of free money from a zero-interest-rate policy .\nThe Fed , beginning in late 2008 , added a new crisis-response tool called quantitative easing ( QE ) , a fancy academic name for printing trillions of dollars and using it to buy everything from mortgages to government debt . This was with the ostensible aim of increasing \u201c the availability of credit \u201d for things like home purchases , but also to \u201c foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally . \u201d\nThe dubious underlying logic was that rescuing the economy and rescuing the financial markets were the same thing . To save people , we had to save the economy in which they operate , which meant saving the high-risk investments of Wall Streeters , as much as they might suck .\nWhat \u2019 s happening in the COVID-19 crisis is the next step : a financial bubble where the Fed isn \u2019 t the cleanup mechanism , but the source of the mania itself . While the real economy is seeing record disruptions , Wall Street has seen prolonged rallies of \u201c rational exuberance \u201d over the Fed \u2019 s decision to usher in \u201c QE infinity \u201d and essentially ban losing in finance capitalism .\nThough this is a Trump bill \u2014 El Pompadour is so determined that the CARES Act be remembered as his work , he fought to get his signature on relief checks \u2014 it passed unanimously , by voice vote in the House , and 96-0 in the Senate .\nTalk to Democrats on the Hill and they will tell you this is a bailout to be cheered and supported , nothing like the 2008 rescue . This time is different , the argument goes : Three-quarters of the money goes to real people .\nThis is true , if one squints and uses a narrow definition of \u201c money. \u201d The $ 2.3 trillion imagines $ 560 billion for \u201c individuals \u201d ( including $ 300 billion in cash payments , much by way of the famed $ 1,200 \u201c Trump \u201d checks ) , plus $ 377 billion for small businesses , as well as $ 339 billion for state and local governments , and $ 100 billion for hospitals and other health care providers , plus some aid for students and children .\nTechnically , \u201c only \u201d about $ 500 billion of the congressionally passed rescue package goes to \u201c big business. \u201d Moreover , the big-business aid ostensibly comes with a range of draconian-sounding conditions barring greedy hijinks , meaning no layoffs , no stock buybacks , no big bonuses , etc. , if companies want the handout .\nThe loophole comes via $ 454 billion created as part of that big-business package . This \u201c emergency fund \u201d will be dumped into a \u201c special-purpose vehicle \u201d used to backstop further lending by the Federal Reserve .\nThat $ 454 billion is designed to grow by a factor of 10 or more . \u201c We can lever up to $ 4 trillion , \u201d said Steve Mnuchin , playing the \u201c free-spending Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury secretary \u201d role that apparently is a prerequisite for financial-disaster narratives in modern America .\nDemocrats early on expressed concern about old-school Tammany Hall-style graft , i.e. , that the fund would be used to invest in businesses with connections . \u201c We \u2019 re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family , \u201d is how Elizabeth Warren put it .\nHowever , once Democrats won superficial oversight concessions ( including the creation of a Congressional Oversight Commission ) , Warren and everyone else in the caucus approved the \u201c slush fund \u201d concept , despite the far more radical issues it poses than individual graft .\nThe CARES Act \u201c slush fund \u201d imagines a future in which markets for all financial products are stressed , perhaps permanently , by lockdowns . In place of a heartless free market of panicked investors who might want to cut their losses and sell , the plan is to simulate real buying and selling of financial products like mortgages and bonds with directed deployments of the Fed \u2019 s endless trillions .\nAnd they will be endless . As Fed chief Jerome Powell put it , the Fed is \u201c not going to run out of ammunition \u201d in the war against the economic crisis . Marcus Stanley of Americans for Financial Reform said , \u201c The Fed \u2019 s perspective on this is , they want to create normalcy. \u201d But what does \u201c normal \u201d mean in an economy that may be changed forever ?\nInvestors were fleeing stocks , bonds , money-market funds , etc. , in the first weeks of March for the perfectly logical reason that most businesses suddenly looked like dicey investments .
