    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker amended his previous closed-door testimony during his opening statement in the public testimony on Capitol Hill in the Trump impeachment inquiry , saying that he and others thought it was `` inappropriate '' for Ambassador Gordon Sondland to mention investigation into Burisma during a July 10 meeting , reversing his previous statement that the subject of investigations had not been mentioned during the meeting .\nVolker is currently testifying along with National Security Council official Tim Morrison .\nFive witnesses are also scheduled to testify this week . They are :\nGordon Sondland , European Union Ambassador and a close Trump ally who other witnesses have described as playing a large role in the White House conversations about Ukraine\nLaura Cooper , a Defense Department official who testified that it became clear aid was being withheld as \u201c it relates to the President 's concerns about corruption . \u201d\nDavid Hale , State Department official who testified behind closed doors about the ouster of U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\nFiona Hill , former White House aide who testified on national security adviser John Bolton \u2019 s concerns about Trump \u2019 s Ukraine policy\nDavid Holmes , State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who overheard Trump ask Sondland about \u201c investigations \u201d on a call\nMorrison refuses to answer why he 'skipped ' chain of command on reporting call\nRep. Val Demings , D-Florida , repeatedly questioned Morrison on why he chose to go directly to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg with his concerns about the July 25 phone call instead of reporting it up his chain of command to the deputy national security adviser Dr. Charlie Kupperman . Demings said if he felt there was nothing improper about the conversation , why did he `` skip '' his chain of command ?\n`` I do n't think I did skip my chain of command , '' Morrison said , saying that his relationship with Eisenberg was largely focused on `` administrative matters '' such as locking down the transcript .\nDemings continued to press him , asking why he was so concerned about the legal adviser being aware of `` this call that you saw nothing , basically , wrong with the substance or content of the call ? ''\nMorrison said he was concerned because he did n't see a member of the legal office in the listening room on the call , and he wanted them to `` be aware of what had transpired . ''\nMorrison and Volker : not appropriate to ask a foreign power to investigate a U.S. citizen\nIn response to a question from Rep. Joaquin Castro , D-Texas , both Morrison and Volker said it was not appropriate for the president to ask a foreign power to investigate a U.S. citizen .\n\u201c I do n't believe it 's appropriate for the president to do that . If law enforcement has concerns with a U.S. citizen , generally , there are appropriate channels for that , \u201d Volker said .\nWenstrup compared Giuliani 's work in Ukraine to Dennis Rodman in North Korea\nRep. Brad Wenstrup , R-Ohio , compared Giuliani \u2019 s efforts in Ukraine to that of Dennis Rodman and James Taylor , an unlikely figure who could mend relations with the country .\nThe comparison came after Volker called Giuliani a \u201c problem \u201d because his messaging was a \u201c variance from our official \u201d message to the president on Ukraine . He said he felt it was \u201c important \u201d to step in and try to \u201c fix the problem . \u201d\nThat was when Wenstrup noted Giuliani \u2019 s work could be compared to other celebrities .\n\u201c Those useful barometers , I think , can come in a lot of different fashions like Dennis Rodman in North Korea or James Taylor in France , singing 'You 've Got a Friend ' if they can help the cause and in that situation , it \u2019 s not illegal , \u201d Wenstrup told Volker .\nRodman , a former NBA star , made a trip to Singapore in 2018 when Trump and North Korea \u2019 s Kim Jong Un first met in 2018 . Rodman had made friends with Kim , a basketball fan , during a visit to North Korea in 2013 .\nTaylor visited France in 2015 with then U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry after the attacks by terrorists on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and on a kosher supermarket in Paris left 17 people dead . He sang \u201c You \u2019 ve got a Friend \u201d during a meeting with then French President Francois Hollande .\nNSC official Tim Morrison said fellow NSC staffer Fiona Hill warned him of the \u201c Gordon problem \u201d regarding European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2019 s dealings in Ukraine .\n\u201c Among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill about Ambassador Sondland \u2013 I think she might have coined it the \u2018 Gordon problem \u2019 - and I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing . I did n't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important , \u201d Morrison said . \u201c He wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting . \u201d\nMorrison added , though , he did not endorse the plan to have Zelensky commit to releasing a message about investigations to secure a meeting .\nHouse Intel Chairman Adam Schiff , D-California , pressed Morrison on whether he thought it was appropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a U.S. person , let alone a political rival , noting Volker found it inappropriate .\nMorrison said `` as a hypothetical '' situation , he did not find it to be appropriate .\n`` Well I 'm not talking about a hypothetical matter , '' Schiff said . `` Read the transcript . ''\nWhen asked if Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens , Morrison said , `` That is not what I understood the president to be doing . ''\nSchiff pointed out this was the first and only time that Morrison went from listening to a presidential call directly to a National Security Council ( NSC ) lawyer .\nThe chairman then asked Morrison to clarify that his concern was not that the call was unlawful but that it might leak , to which Morrison agreed .\n`` Well if it was a perfect call , would you have had a concern of it leaking ? '' Schiff asked , referring to Trump 's description of his conversation with Zelensky .\n`` No , '' Morrison quickly responded , before adding : `` Well , I would still have concern about it leaking . ''\nSchiff also asked Morrison whether it would be appropriate if the president asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich , Nancy Pelosi or Amb . Volker . Morrison responded , `` in those hypothetical cases , no . Not appropriate . ''\nMorrison said he could `` only speak to what I understood at the time and why I acted the way I did at the time . ''\nFormer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said his memory was \u201c jogged \u201d by other witnesses \u2019 testimony , causing him to amend his prior testimony .\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff had asked why he changed his testimony about a July 10 meeting between White House and Ukrainian officials .\n\u201c I learned other things including seeing the statements from Alexander Vindman and from Fiona Hill that reminded me that at the very end of that meeting as was recounted in Colonel Vindman \u2019 s statement - yes I did remember that . ''\nIn his previous testimony , Volker said there had not been discussion of investigations during the July 10 meeting , but said in his opening statement that Sondland brought up investigations , a reference Volker found \u201c inappropriate . \u201d\nVolker said Sondland \u2019 s discussion of \u201c investigations \u201d in the July 10 meeting was a \u201c bit of an eye roll moment . \u201d\nAccording to Volker , the Ukrainians had gotten less out of the meeting than they had hoped for in the meeting , \u201c and then this comes up at the very end of the meeting . This is not what we should be talking about . \u201d\nVolker told lawmakers he did not agree with the assessment that several officials were working on a secondary \u201c irregular \u201d channel on Ukrainian policy .\nHe pushed back on Bill Taylor , the top diplomat in Ukraine , who characterized this policy channel as such and said he believed that Giuliani , who was pushing for investigations of Biden and the 2016 election , was working alone .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t view that as a channel at all , \u201d Volker said of Giuliani \u2019 s work , adding this was because Giuliani is not someone \u201c who represents the U.S. government . \u201d\nHe said having others , including Energy Secretary Rick Perry in negotiations with Ukraine was \u201c a positive thing . \u201d\n`` I think having support from various U.S. officials is a positive thing , \u201d Volker said .\nLt. Gen. Keith Kellogg , national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence , issued a statement on earlier testimony from Jennifer Williams , a State Department aide detailed to the vice president 's office . He said he listened in to the July 25 phone call and said he heard `` nothing wrong or improper on the call , '' contradicting Williams , who testified she found the call `` unusual '' and `` inappropriate . ''\nWilliams said the call struck her as unusual because , in comparison to other calls she listened in on , the July 25 call `` involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter . ''\nKellogg also said in the statement that Williams , as she testified , never reported personal or professional concerns regarding the call to him as her direct supervisor .\n`` In fact , she never reported any personal or professional concerns to any other member of the Vice President 's staff , including our chief of staff and the vice president , '' his statement read .\nKellogg added that she accurately testified about Pence 's preparations for his September 1 meeting with Zelensky and that the vice president `` never mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden , CrowdStrike , Burisma , or investigations in any communications with Ukrainians . ''\nVolker did n't believe 2016 statement was a condition to host Ukraine\nVolker said he did not believe that a statement he was working on with Ukrainians that specifically mentioned probes into Burisma and the 2016 election was a condition in order to host a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine \u2019 s president .\nWhen asked if it was his testimony that he was not aware that it was a condition , Volker said , \u201c I didn \u2019 t believe it was a condition . \u201d\nSome of those in the crowded hearing room laughed and shook their heads at Volker when he asserted this .\nVolker went on , explaining that he believed the statement would have been \u201c very helpful \u201d in getting the president on board , noting Trump had been \u201c highly skeptical \u201d of Ukraine because of its history of corruption .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t have called it a condition . It \u2019 s a nuance , I guess , \u201d Volker said . \u201c I viewed it as very helpful . If we could get this done , it would help improve the perception that President Trump and others had . \u201d\nMorrison : The July 25 call summary was mistakenly put in a secure server\nTim Morrison testified that he was told it was a `` mistake '' that the summary of the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky was placed on a secure server used for classified information .\nMorrison said it was an `` administrative error , '' contradicting earlier testimony from NSC aide Lt. Col Alexander Vindman .\nVindman testified that White House Counsel John Eisenberg directed the call record to be placed on a secure server in order to prevent leaks .\nVolker : \u2018 Never conveyed \u2019 linkage between aid and investigations to Ukrainians\nFormer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told lawmakers he \u201c never conveyed \u201d a linkage between security assistance and investigations to the Ukrainians .\n\u201c A great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light , \u201d Volker said , amending his previous Oct. 3 closed-door testimony .\nVolker said was not aware of or knowingly took part in any efforts to pressure Kyiv to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden .\nHe explained he thought there was `` an important distinction '' between investigations into Ukrainian gas company Burisma and former Vice President Joe Biden . He added that he did not realize President Donald Trump or others had conflated an investigation of `` possible Ukrainian corruption '' with an investigation into Biden .\nHe continued that he saw the investigation into Burisma as `` appropriate and unremarkable , '' and the probe into Biden as `` unacceptable . ''\n`` In retrospect , I should have seen that connection differently , and had I done so , I would have raised my own objections . ''\nHe said Sondland had brought up investigations in a July 10 meeting with Bolton and Ukrainian officials , and he found it `` inappropriate . '' Previously , Volker said there had been no discussion of investigations during the July 10 meeting .\nPrior testimony and documents released in the impeachment inquiry showed Volker involved in conversations with Trump \u2019 s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and White House officials to set up Trump \u2019 s call with Zelensky and a potential White House visit .\n`` Assuming President Z ( Zelensky ) convinces trump he will investigate/ '' get to the bottom of what happened '' in 2016 , we will nail down a date for visit to Washington . Good luck ! , '' Volker told his Ukrainian counterpart in a July 25 text message released as part of the impeachment inquiry .\nMorrison : 'My fears have been realized ' about the release of the Trump-Zelensky call\nTimothy Morrison , the NSC senior director for Europe and Russia , said in his opening statement that his `` fears have been realized '' about the disclosure of Trump 's July 25 call with Zelensky .\n`` As I stated during my deposition , I feared at the time of the call how its disclosure would play in Washington 's political climate , '' Morrison said . `` My fears have been realized . ''\nMorrison had told lawmakers and staff during his closed-door testimony that he was concerned about the implications of a leak of the call with regards to how it would be viewed in `` Washington 's polarized environment , '' its potential effects on the `` bipartisan support '' for Ukraine , and impacts on Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship .\nMorrison appeared to pre-empt Republican questions about his closed-door deposition in which he said he was concerned about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman 's judgment .\nMorrison , who is Vindman 's superior , said he was not here to question the `` character or integrity '' of his NSC colleagues .\n`` My recollections are my own , '' he continued . `` Some of my colleagues \u2019 recollections of conversations and interactions may differ from mine , but I do not view those differences as the result of an untoward purpose. ``\nHe also told lawmakers he did not know the identity of the whisteblower and he did n't intend to speculate .\nMorrison also raised the importance of the military conflict in Eastern Ukraine and the reform of Ukraine 's politics and economy .\n`` Every day that the focus of discussion involving Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests Ukraine , the United States , and Western-style Liberalism share , '' he said .\nAfter about a two-hour break , members of the House Intelligence Committee gathered for the second hearing of the day to question Kurt Volker , the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine , and Tim Morrison , a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia .\nSchiff started out the hearing outlining the evidence the committee has gathered , establishing a timeline on the Trump administration \u2019 s conduct toward Ukraine and what various witnesses have testified was a quid-pro-quo in holding up military aid and a key White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to launch investigations helping to the president politically .\n\u201c While Trump claimed there was no quid pro quo , his insistence that Zelensky himself publicly announce the investigations or they would be at a stalemate , made clear that at least two official acts \u2014 a White House meeting and $ 400 million in military aid \u2014 were conditioned on receipt of what Trump wanted , the investigations to help his campaign , \u201d Schiff said .\nNunes called the hearing \u201c part two \u201d of a \u201c circus. \u201d He characterized the hearing as part of an effort to `` overthrow a duly elected president . \u201d\nRepublican members of the House Intelligence Committee focused much of their attention on undercutting the credibility of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman , the National Security Council ( NSC ) aide and decorated Iraq war veteran who said he found President Donald Trump \u2019 s July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u201c inappropriate . \u201d\nSeveral members focused on his character and appeared to suggest he could have leaked information as he told two other people about his concerns over the phone call \u2013 State Department Deputy Sec . George Kent and a member of the intelligence community .\nRep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , asked about closed-door testimony from Timothy Morrison , an NSC senior director for Europe and Russia who said some officials had questioned Vindman \u2019 s judgment and that he was concerned Vindman might leak information .\nVindman responded by reading excerpts from a July performance evaluation from Morrison \u2019 s predecessor , Fiona Hill , who described him as \u201c unflappable \u201d and exercising \u201c excellent judgment . \u201d\nRep. Elise Stefanik , R-N.Y. , appeared to suggest Vindman was speaking out of turn when he asserted himself as the `` authority on Ukraine . '' She pointed out Vindman 's chain of command included Morrison , former National Security Advisory John Bolton and the president . He clarified that he advises `` up through the chain of command , that 's what I do . ''\n`` Do you agree that the president sets the policy as commander in chief as you testified previously ? '' Stefanik asked .\nIn another exchange , Rep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , appeared to mock Vindman for correcting Rep. Devin Nunes , the top GOP member on the committee , on referring to him by his military rank instead of \u201c Mr . Vindman . \u201d\n`` Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank ? '' Stewart asked .\nThe Purple Heart recipient said he was dressed in uniform , which is required for active duty officers appearing before Congress , and felt it was appropriate . He then added that the attacks he faced both in media and on Twitter \u201c marginalized \u201d the fact he was a military officer .\nSteve Castor , the lead Republican lawyer for the impeachment hearing , pressed Vindman about whether he was offered the position of Ukraine \u2019 s defense minister three times by Oleksandr Danylyuk , a former aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky .\nCastor \u2019 s line of questioning appeared to raise questions about Vindman \u2019 s loyalty to the U.S. , but the national security aide said he \u201c immediately dismissed the offers , \u201d adding that he reported it up the chain of command .\n\u201c I \u2019 m an American . I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers , did not entertain them. \u201d Vindman said . \u201c The whole notion is rather comical . \u201d\nDanylyuk told The Daily Beast on Tuesday the pair laughed over the offer and that it \u201c was clearly a joke . \u201d\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney , D-N.Y. , got Vindman to sum up his testimony by asking for his first impression of the July 25 call .\n\u201c Frankly , I couldn \u2019 t believe what I was hearing , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c There was probably an element of shock . \u201d\nMaloney asked whether Vindman was worried about stepping forward to testify .\n\u201c I knew there was going to be a lot of risk , \u201d Vindman said .\nBut he said he was confident in the United States .\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio closed the Republican questioning in the morning hearing by arguing that Democrats have tried to oust President Donald Trump since he was elected in November 2016 , first with an FBI investigation of his campaign that found no collusion with Russia , then with special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation and now with the House impeachment inquiry .\nBut Jordan said the 63 million Americans who elected Trump could see through the unfairness of the process .\n\u201c This is scary what these guys are putting this country through . It is sad , it is scary and it is wrong , \u201d Jordan said . \u201c The facts are on the president \u2019 s side . The process certainly is not . \u201d\nThroughout the hearings , Republicans sparred with Vindman , needling him over his reputation and peppering him with questions about his role in U.S.-Ukraine relations .\nRep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , appeared to take issue with Vindman 's exchange with Rep. Devin Nunes , in which he corrected the top Republican on referring to him by his military rank instead of `` Mr . Vindman . ''\nStewart noted that Vindman typically wears a suit to the White House and chose to wear his uniform to the hearing . Active duty service members are required to wear their uniforms when appearing before Congress .\nStewart then sharply asked : `` Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank ? ''\nThe Purple Heart recipient noted he was dressed in uniform and thought it would be `` more appropriate . '' When Stewart continued to press Vindman , he added that `` the attacks I 've had in the press and Twitter have kind of eliminated the fact that , either , or marginalized me as a military officer . ''\n\u201c I \u2019 m just telling you that the ranking member meant no disrespect to you , \u201d Stewart said . Vindman agreed he did not think Nunes meant any disrespect .\nTrump , who mocked Vindman for wearing his uniform last week in closed-door testimony , noted the exchange between Nunes and Vindman during his cabinet meeting .\nWhen asked about today 's hearing , Trump said of Vindman : `` I do n't know him . I do n't know , as he says , 'Lt . Colonel . ' I understand somebody had him the misfortune of calling him 'Mr . ' and he corrected them . I never saw the man . I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in . No , I do n't know Vindman at all . ''\nThe president watched Vindman \u2019 s testimony for a while this morning , saying , \u201c I \u2019 m going to let people make their own determination . \u201d\n\u201c All of these people are talking about they heard a conversation , a conversation of another conversation that was had by the president . What \u2019 s going on is a disgrace , and it \u2019 s an embarrassment to our nation , '' he said before going after the House speaker . `` And in the meantime , we can \u2019 t get USMCA approved because Nancy Pelosi is grossly incompetent . She \u2019 s incompetent , and you \u2019 re about to find that out . \u201d\nRep. Joaquin Castro , D-Texas , whose identical twin brother Julian Castro is a Democratic presidential candidate , joked with lieutenant colonel about the fact his twin brother was at the hearing .\n\u201c It is nice to talk to a fellow identical twin , and I hope that your brother is nicer to you than mine is me , and does n't make you grow a beard , \u201d he said , to laughter from the audience .\nYevgeny Vindman , also a National Security Council official , is sitting in the audience at today \u2019 s hearing .\nBoth witnesses were asked by Rep. Jim Himes , D-Conn. , if they would consider themselves \u201c Never Trumpers , \u201d in response to previous tweets by the president attacking Williams and other witnesses .\n`` I \u2019 m not sure I know an official definition of a Never Trumper , '' Williams said , \u201c I would not , no . ''\n\u201c Tell Jennifer Williams , whoever that is , to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls , & see the just-released statement from Ukraine , \u201d Trump tweeted Nov. 17 . \u201c Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers , who I don \u2019 t know & mostly never even heard of , & work out a better presidential attack ! \u201d\nRep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , said that Timothy Morrison , a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia , who is scheduled to testify Tuesday afternoon , told lawmakers during his closed-door deposition that some officials had questioned Vindman \u2019 s judgment and that Morrison worried he might leak information .\nVindman read a July performance evaluation from Morrison \u2019 s predecessor , Fiona Hill , who is scheduled to testify Thursday and described Vindman as \u201c brilliant , '' \u201c unflappable \u201d and someone who \u201c exercised excellent judgment . \u201d\n\u201c I think you get the idea , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c I can \u2019 t say why Mr. Morrison questioned my judgment . \u201d\n\u201c I never did , never would , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c That is preposterous that I would do that . \u201d\nVindman \u2019 s involvement in the impeachment inquiry has prompted the Army to provide protection to him and his family .\n`` The Army is providing supportive assistance to help Lt. Col. Vindman with the public attention , \u201d said Col. Kathy Turner , an Army spokeswoman . \u201c As a matter of practice , the Army would neither confirm nor deny any safety or security measures taken on behalf of an individual ; however , as we would with any soldier , the Army will work with civilian authorities to ensure that he and his family are properly protected . ''\nRep. Devin Nunes , the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee , questioned Williams and Vindman on whether they leaked information regarding Trump 's July 25 phone call with Zelensky .\nThe Republican then pressed Vindman on whether he knows anyone who discussed the phone call with members of the media . Vindman directed Nunes to the NSC communications office before saying he did not know anyone .\nWhen Nunes asked if either witness discussed the call with anyone outside the White House , Vindman said he discussed the call with State Department Deputy Secretary George Kent and an individual in the intelligence community .\nNunes asked who the member of the intelligence community was , prompting Schiff to interject to ensure it was not an attempt to out the whistleblower , whose letter about the call sparked the impeachment probe . Vindman said he was advised by his lawyer not to identify anyone when asked about members of the intelligence community .\nNunes continued to press Vindman to identify the member of the intelligence community he spoke to but the National Security Council aide refused to concede . Tensions grew as Vindman 's lawyer intervened to say his client was not going to answer the question while Schiff supported the decision , arguing that it appeared Nunes was attempting to identify the whistleblower .\n\u201c I want to make sure that this is not an attempt to out the whistleblower , \u201d said Schiff , who said the whistleblower is protected with anonymity by law .\nNunes stated Vindman had testified that he didn \u2019 t know who the whistleblower was .\n\u201c I do not know who the whistleblower is , \u201d Vindman said .\nNunes then asked how it was possible he could identify the whistleblower , if he didn \u2019 t know the name .\n\u201c Sir , under advice of my counsel , I have been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community , \u201d Vindman said .\nNunes reminded Vindman that he was testifying at the Intelligence Committee , to laughter in the audience . But Vindman declined to answer .\n\u201c Under advice of my counsel and instructions of the chairman , I have been advised not to provide any specifics on who I have spoken to inside the intelligence community , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c But I can offer that these people were properly cleared individuals with a need to know . \u201d\nNunes said Republicans had tried to subpoena the whistleblower , but the motion was tabled by committee Democrats . Nunes ended his questioning by calling the hearings an \u201c impeachment inquisition . \u201d\nA woman in the gallery gasped when Schiff told the room not to out the whistleblower and other members of the audience raised their heads to get a better look at the exchange .\n`` I was shocked , '' said Mar Roberts of Washington , D.C. , who gasped when the topic of the whistleblower came up because , she said , that 's a statutory issue . Roberts , 68 , who was taking detailed notes on her phone , said she also attended the Watergate impeachment hearings .\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Vindman if the Ukrainians offered him the position of defense minister .\nVindman said he \u201c immediately dismissed \u201d the three offers and notified his superiors and counterintelligence officials .\n\u201c I \u2019 m an American . I came here when I was a toddler , and I immediately dismissed these offers . I did not entertain them , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s pretty funny for a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army , which isn \u2019 t really that senior , to be offered that illustrious of a position .\n\u201c Just to be clear , there were two other staff officers , embassy Kyiv staff officers that were sitting next to me when this offer was made , \u201d Vindman said . One of the officers , Vindman said , was David Holmes , who testified behind closed doors last Friday .\nA member of the Foreign Affairs Committee , Rep. Scott Perry , R-Pa. , told reporters during a recess that lawmakers weren \u2019 t challenging Vindman \u2019 s loyalty to the U.S .\n\u201c No , I don \u2019 t have any reason to question his loyalty , and I don \u2019 t think anyone on the committee is either , but I think we need to see the entire picture , \u201d Perry said . \u201c The American people need to see what happens in these discussions with foreign governments and the people who work for our government . \u201d\nHe suggested the offer to Vindman was an example of how foreign governments try to `` curry favor '' with U.S. officials .\nPerry said testimony revealed that Vindman disagreed with U.S. officials about whether Trump \u2019 s call for investigations coincided with national-security interests .\nVindman corrected Nunes after the Republican referred to him as \u201c mister , \u201d rather than by his military rank .\n\u201c Mr . Vindman , you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistle-blower , \u201d Nunes started to ask .\nIn response to questions from Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , NSC aide Alexander Vindman said he knew without hesitation that he had to report his concerns about the July 25 call to White House lawyers . Vindman said that coming from a military culture , Trump \u2019 s request sounded more like a demand than a polite request that Ukraine could disregard .\n\u201c It was inappropriate , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c It was improper for the president to request , to demand an investigation into a political opponent , especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this could be an impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge . \u201d\nVindman said that given the `` power disparity '' between the United States and Ukraine , it was clear that Trump 's request for investigations was more of a demand than a request .\n`` The culture I come from , the military culture , when a senior asks you to do something , even if it 's polite and pleasant , it 's not to be taken as a request . It 's to be taken as an order , '' Vindman said . `` In this case , the power disparity between the two leaders , my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting , President Zelensky would have to deliver the investigations . ''\nAt the direction of her attorney , Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams declined to answer a question from Schiff about a Sept. 18 call between the vice president and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n`` The September 18 call is classified , '' said her attorney , adding that Pence \u2019 s office had said she could not talk about it in an open setting .\nWilliams said she would submit a classified statement to the committee in writing about the call .\nRead opening remarks : Statements from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams\nA summary from the vice president 's office of the call said Pence commended Zelensky \u2019 s administration for `` bold action to tackle corruption through legislative reforms , and offered full U.S. support for those efforts . \u201d\nNational Security Council aide Alexander Vindman told the House Intelligence Committee he reported his concerns about a July 10 meeting with Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , and the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky . The decorated Army soldier said he privately reported his concerns through official channels out of a sense of duty .\n\u201c I was concerned by the call , \u201d Vindman said . \u201c What I heard was inappropriate . \u201d\nJennifer Williams , a State Department official detailed to Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s office , testified about how she found Trump \u2019 s July 25 phone call \u201c unusual \u201d because of the discussion of \u201c a domestic political matter . \u201d\n\u201c I found the July 25 phone call unusual because , in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed , it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter , \u201d she said .\nShe did not , however , discuss the call with the vice president or any of her other colleagues .\nWilliams also outlined her career in public service as a \u201c career officer \u201d rather than a partisan .\n\u201c As a career officer , I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad , in support of the President \u2019 s foreign policy objectives , \u201d she said .\nNunes , the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee , attacked the media and Democrats in his opening statement , slamming `` fake news '' and calling news outlets `` puppets of the Democratic Party . ''\n`` If you watched the impeachment hearings last week , you may have noticed a disconnect between what you actually saw and the mainstream media accounts describing it , '' Nunes said .\n`` With their biased misreporting on the Russia hoax , the media lost the confidence of millions of Americans , '' he added .\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff opened the hearing by noting how both witnesses were on the July 25 call , giving them firsthand knowledge of the events that day .\nHe laid out the case Democrats hope to make today as lawmakers debate whether to impeach the president .\n`` If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections , if he sought to condition , coerce , extort , or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 it will be up to us to decide , whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency , '' Schiff noted .\n`` Today \u2019 s witnesses , like those who testified last week , are here because they were subpoenaed to appear , not because they are for or against impeachment , '' Schiff said .\nHouse Republicans have criticized previous witnesses for their indirect knowledge of events on the call , calling it `` hearsay . ''\nJust before the hearing began , President Donald Trump posted a tweet right before the hearing started , stressing the rise of the stock market .\nTrump has previously slammed Vindman on Twitter as a \u201c Never Trumper \u201d and urged him to read a transcript of the call . The call occurred during a suspension in providing U.S. military aid to Ukraine , but Trump has insisted he didn \u2019 t demand the investigation in exchange for the funding .\nAsked on Nov. 3 for evidence that Vindman was a \u201c Never Trumper , \u201d the president replied : \u201c You \u2019 ll be seeing very soon what comes out . \u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , sent a letter Monday to Defense Secretary Mark Esper urging him to notify all civilian and military personnel of their legal rights to make protected disclosures to Congress free from retaliation . Schumer said Vindman and Laura Cooper , a deputy assistant secretary of Defense , who is scheduled to testify Wednesday , have been attacked as traitors in the media .\n\u201c Bravely , in the face of these shameful attacks , these individuals have still chosen to come forward and tell the truth despite the risk of professional reprisals and threats to their personal safety , \u201d Schumer said . \u201c I fear , however , these attacks will only increase after their participation in these public hearings . \u201d\nEsper has said the Pentagon has protections for whistleblowers and Vindman \u201c shouldn \u2019 t have any fear of retaliation . \u201d\nAlso on Tuesday morning , the committee will hear from Jennifer Williams , a National Security Council aide assigned from the State Department to the office of Vice President Mike Pence . She listened to the July 25 call and provided a memo about the call to Pence , although she couldn \u2019 t say whether he read it . She told lawmakers at her closed-door deposition that it was \u201c folly \u201d to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was \u201c unusual . \u201d\n`` I would say that it struck me as unusual and inappropriate , '' Williams said when asked what her own personal reaction to the call was .\nOn Tuesday afternoon , the panel will hear from Kurt Volker , the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine , and Tim Morrison , a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia .\nRepublicans had asked to hear from Volker and Morrison to compare their testimony to Vindman \u2019 s . Volker in his closed-door testimony described Trump 's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine . The special envoy also said `` no , '' when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens , in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election .\n`` Even if he 's asking them to investigate the Bidens , it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something , '' Volker said .\nRepublicans have argued that the dispute about the July 25 call amounts to policy disagreements , and that Trump has the authority to direct foreign policy .\nMorrison told lawmakers in his closed-door deposition that he asked National Security Council lawyers to review Trump \u2019 s July 25 call because he thought it \u201c would be damaging \u201d if it \u201c leaked . \u201d\nBut Morrison also said the White House chief of staff \u2019 s office had informed the Office of Management and Budget that \u201c it was the President \u2019 s direction to hold the assistance . \u201d",
    "content_original": "USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker amended his previous closed-door testimony during his opening statement in the public testimony on Capitol Hill in the Trump impeachment inquiry, saying that he and others thought it was \"inappropriate\" for Ambassador Gordon Sondland to mention investigation into Burisma during a July 10 meeting, reversing his previous statement that the subject of investigations had not been mentioned during the meeting.\n\nVolker is currently testifying along with National Security Council official Tim Morrison.\n\nHearings have now concluded for Tuesday.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nFive witnesses are also scheduled to testify this week. They are:\n\nGordon Sondland, European Union Ambassador and a close Trump ally who other witnesses have described as playing a large role in the White House conversations about Ukraine\n\nLaura Cooper, a Defense Department official who testified that it became clear aid was being withheld as \u201cit relates to the President's concerns about corruption.\u201d\n\nDavid Hale, State Department official who testified behind closed doors about the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\n\nFiona Hill, former White House aide who testified on national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy\n\nDavid Holmes, State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who overheard Trump ask Sondland about \u201cinvestigations\u201d on a call\n\nMorrison refuses to answer why he 'skipped' chain of command on reporting call\n\nRep. Val Demings, D-Florida, repeatedly questioned Morrison on why he chose to go directly to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg with his concerns about the July 25 phone call instead of reporting it up his chain of command to the deputy national security adviser Dr. Charlie Kupperman. Demings said if he felt there was nothing improper about the conversation, why did he \"skip\" his chain of command?\n\n\"I don't think I did skip my chain of command,\" Morrison said, saying that his relationship with Eisenberg was largely focused on \"administrative matters\" such as locking down the transcript.\n\nDemings continued to press him, asking why he was so concerned about the legal adviser being aware of \"this call that you saw nothing, basically, wrong with the substance or content of the call?\"\n\nMorrison said he was concerned because he didn't see a member of the legal office in the listening room on the call, and he wanted them to \"be aware of what had transpired.\"\n\nMorrison and Volker: not appropriate to ask a foreign power to investigate a U.S. citizen\n\nIn response to a question from Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, both Morrison and Volker said it was not appropriate for the president to ask a foreign power to investigate a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cI don't believe it's appropriate for the president to do that. If law enforcement has concerns with a U.S. citizen, generally, there are appropriate channels for that,\u201d Volker said.\n\nMorrison agreed.\n\n\u201cI agree with Ambassador Volker,\u201d he said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nWenstrup compared Giuliani's work in Ukraine to Dennis Rodman in North Korea\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, compared Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine to that of Dennis Rodman and James Taylor, an unlikely figure who could mend relations with the country.\n\nThe comparison came after Volker called Giuliani a \u201cproblem\u201d because his messaging was a \u201cvariance from our official\u201d message to the president on Ukraine. He said he felt it was \u201cimportant\u201d to step in and try to \u201cfix the problem.\u201d\n\nThat was when Wenstrup noted Giuliani\u2019s work could be compared to other celebrities.\n\n\u201cThose useful barometers, I think, can come in a lot of different fashions like Dennis Rodman in North Korea or James Taylor in France, singing 'You've Got a Friend' if they can help the cause and in that situation, it\u2019s not illegal,\u201d Wenstrup told Volker.\n\nRodman, a former NBA star, made a trip to Singapore in 2018 when Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un first met in 2018. Rodman had made friends with Kim, a basketball fan, during a visit to North Korea in 2013.\n\nTaylor visited France in 2015 with then U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry after the attacks by terrorists on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and on a kosher supermarket in Paris left 17 people dead. He sang \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Friend\u201d during a meeting with then French President Francois Hollande.\n\nHill warned Morrison of the \u201cGordon problem\u201d\n\nNSC official Tim Morrison said fellow NSC staffer Fiona Hill warned him of the \u201cGordon problem\u201d regarding European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAmong the discussions I had with Dr. Hill about Ambassador Sondland \u2013 I think she might have coined it the \u2018Gordon problem\u2019 - and I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believed was important,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe wanted to get a meeting -- I understood that the president wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting so I was tracking that we need to schedule a meeting.\u201d\n\nMorrison added, though, he did not endorse the plan to have Zelensky commit to releasing a message about investigations to secure a meeting.\n\nSchiff grills Morrison on July 25 call\n\nHouse Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, pressed Morrison on whether he thought it was appropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a U.S. person, let alone a political rival, noting Volker found it inappropriate.\n\nMorrison said \"as a hypothetical\" situation, he did not find it to be appropriate.\n\n\"Well I'm not talking about a hypothetical matter,\" Schiff said. \"Read the transcript.\"\n\nWhen asked if Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, Morrison said, \"That is not what I understood the president to be doing.\"\n\nSchiff pointed out this was the first and only time that Morrison went from listening to a presidential call directly to a National Security Council (NSC) lawyer.\n\nThe chairman then asked Morrison to clarify that his concern was not that the call was unlawful but that it might leak, to which Morrison agreed.\n\n\"Well if it was a perfect call, would you have had a concern of it leaking?\" Schiff asked, referring to Trump's description of his conversation with Zelensky.\n\n\"No,\" Morrison quickly responded, before adding: \"Well, I would still have concern about it leaking.\"\n\nSchiff also asked Morrison whether it would be appropriate if the president asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich, Nancy Pelosi or Amb. Volker. Morrison responded, \"in those hypothetical cases, no. Not appropriate.\"\n\n\"But you're not sure about Joe Biden?\" Schiff continued.\n\nMorrison said he could \"only speak to what I understood at the time and why I acted the way I did at the time.\"\n\nVolker explains why he changed his testimony\n\nFormer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said his memory was \u201cjogged\u201d by other witnesses\u2019 testimony, causing him to amend his prior testimony.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff had asked why he changed his testimony about a July 10 meeting between White House and Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cI learned other things including seeing the statements from Alexander Vindman and from Fiona Hill that reminded me that at the very end of that meeting as was recounted in Colonel Vindman\u2019s statement - yes I did remember that.\"\n\nIn his previous testimony, Volker said there had not been discussion of investigations during the July 10 meeting, but said in his opening statement that Sondland brought up investigations, a reference Volker found \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nVolker said Sondland\u2019s discussion of \u201cinvestigations\u201d in the July 10 meeting was a \u201cbit of an eye roll moment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Volker, the Ukrainians had gotten less out of the meeting than they had hoped for in the meeting, \u201cand then this comes up at the very end of the meeting. This is not what we should be talking about.\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nVolker says he didn\u2019t view secondary channel as \u2018irregular\u2019\n\nVolker told lawmakers he did not agree with the assessment that several officials were working on a secondary \u201cirregular\u201d channel on Ukrainian policy.\n\nHe pushed back on Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, who characterized this policy channel as such and said he believed that Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations of Biden and the 2016 election, was working alone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view that as a channel at all,\u201d Volker said of Giuliani\u2019s work, adding this was because Giuliani is not someone \u201cwho represents the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nHe said having others, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry in negotiations with Ukraine was \u201ca positive thing.\u201d\n\n\"I think having support from various U.S. officials is a positive thing,\u201d Volker said.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nWilliams' supervisor at Pence's office weighs in her testimony\n\nLt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, issued a statement on earlier testimony from Jennifer Williams, a State Department aide detailed to the vice president's office. He said he listened in to the July 25 phone call and said he heard \"nothing wrong or improper on the call,\" contradicting Williams, who testified she found the call \"unusual\" and \"inappropriate.\"\n\nWilliams said the call struck her as unusual because, in comparison to other calls she listened in on, the July 25 call \"involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.\"\n\nKellogg also said in the statement that Williams, as she testified, never reported personal or professional concerns regarding the call to him as her direct supervisor.\n\n\"In fact, she never reported any personal or professional concerns to any other member of the Vice President's staff, including our chief of staff and the vice president,\" his statement read.\n\nKellogg added that she accurately testified about Pence's preparations for his September 1 meeting with Zelensky and that the vice president \"never mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden, CrowdStrike, Burisma, or investigations in any communications with Ukrainians.\"\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nVolker didn't believe 2016 statement was a condition to host Ukraine\n\nVolker said he did not believe that a statement he was working on with Ukrainians that specifically mentioned probes into Burisma and the 2016 election was a condition in order to host a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nWhen asked if it was his testimony that he was not aware that it was a condition, Volker said, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was a condition.\u201d\n\nSome of those in the crowded hearing room laughed and shook their heads at Volker when he asserted this.\n\nVolker went on, explaining that he believed the statement would have been \u201cvery helpful\u201d in getting the president on board, noting Trump had been \u201chighly skeptical\u201d of Ukraine because of its history of corruption.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have called it a condition. It\u2019s a nuance, I guess,\u201d Volker said. \u201cI viewed it as very helpful. If we could get this done, it would help improve the perception that President Trump and others had.\u201d\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nMorrison: The July 25 call summary was mistakenly put in a secure server\n\nTim Morrison testified that he was told it was a \"mistake\" that the summary of the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky was placed on a secure server used for classified information.\n\nMorrison said it was an \"administrative error,\" contradicting earlier testimony from NSC aide Lt. Col Alexander Vindman.\n\nVindman testified that White House Counsel John Eisenberg directed the call record to be placed on a secure server in order to prevent leaks.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nHow to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\n\nVolker: \u2018Never conveyed\u2019 linkage between aid and investigations to Ukrainians\n\nFormer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told lawmakers he \u201cnever conveyed\u201d a linkage between security assistance and investigations to the Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cA great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light,\u201d Volker said, amending his previous Oct. 3 closed-door testimony.\n\nVolker said was not aware of or knowingly took part in any efforts to pressure Kyiv to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nHe explained he thought there was \"an important distinction\" between investigations into Ukrainian gas company Burisma and former Vice President Joe Biden. He added that he did not realize President Donald Trump or others had conflated an investigation of \"possible Ukrainian corruption\" with an investigation into Biden.\n\nHe continued that he saw the investigation into Burisma as \"appropriate and unremarkable,\" and the probe into Biden as \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.\"\n\nHe said Sondland had brought up investigations in a July 10 meeting with Bolton and Ukrainian officials, and he found it \"inappropriate.\" Previously, Volker said there had been no discussion of investigations during the July 10 meeting.\n\nPrior testimony and documents released in the impeachment inquiry showed Volker involved in conversations with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and White House officials to set up Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky and a potential White House visit.\n\n\"Assuming President Z (Zelensky) convinces trump he will investigate/\"get to the bottom of what happened\" in 2016, we will nail down a date for visit to Washington. Good luck!,\" Volker told his Ukrainian counterpart in a July 25 text message released as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n-Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nMorrison: 'My fears have been realized' about the release of the Trump-Zelensky call\n\nTimothy Morrison, the NSC senior director for Europe and Russia, said in his opening statement that his \"fears have been realized\" about the disclosure of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\n\"As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate,\" Morrison said. \"My fears have been realized.\"\n\nMorrison had told lawmakers and staff during his closed-door testimony that he was concerned about the implications of a leak of the call with regards to how it would be viewed in \"Washington's polarized environment,\" its potential effects on the \"bipartisan support\" for Ukraine, and impacts on Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.\n\nMorrison appeared to pre-empt Republican questions about his closed-door deposition in which he said he was concerned about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's judgment.\n\nMorrison, who is Vindman's superior, said he was not here to question the \"character or integrity\" of his NSC colleagues.\n\n\"My recollections are my own,\" he continued. \"Some of my colleagues\u2019 recollections of conversations and interactions may differ from mine, but I do not view those differences as the result of an untoward purpose. \"\n\nHe also told lawmakers he did not know the identity of the whisteblower and he didn't intend to speculate.\n\nMorrison also raised the importance of the military conflict in Eastern Ukraine and the reform of Ukraine's politics and economy.\n\n\"Every day that the focus of discussion involving Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests Ukraine, the United States, and Western-style Liberalism share,\" he said.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff opens hearing with minority witnesses\n\nAfter about a two-hour break, members of the House Intelligence Committee gathered for the second hearing of the day to question Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\nSchiff started out the hearing outlining the evidence the committee has gathered, establishing a timeline on the Trump administration\u2019s conduct toward Ukraine and what various witnesses have testified was a quid-pro-quo in holding up military aid and a key White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to launch investigations helping to the president politically.\n\n\u201cWhile Trump claimed there was no quid pro quo, his insistence that Zelensky himself publicly announce the investigations or they would be at a stalemate, made clear that at least two official acts \u2014 a White House meeting and $400 million in military aid \u2014 were conditioned on receipt of what Trump wanted, the investigations to help his campaign,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nNunes called the hearing \u201cpart two\u201d of a \u201ccircus.\u201d He characterized the hearing as part of an effort to \"overthrow a duly elected president.\u201d\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nGOP spars with Vindman\n\nRepublican members of the House Intelligence Committee focused much of their attention on undercutting the credibility of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council (NSC) aide and decorated Iraq war veteran who said he found President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nSeveral members focused on his character and appeared to suggest he could have leaked information as he told two other people about his concerns over the phone call \u2013 State Department Deputy Sec. George Kent and a member of the intelligence community.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked about closed-door testimony from Timothy Morrison, an NSC senior director for Europe and Russia who said some officials had questioned Vindman\u2019s judgment and that he was concerned Vindman might leak information.\n\nVindman responded by reading excerpts from a July performance evaluation from Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Fiona Hill, who described him as \u201cunflappable\u201d and exercising \u201cexcellent judgment.\u201d\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., appeared to suggest Vindman was speaking out of turn when he asserted himself as the \"authority on Ukraine.\" She pointed out Vindman's chain of command included Morrison, former National Security Advisory John Bolton and the president. He clarified that he advises \"up through the chain of command, that's what I do.\"\n\n\"Do you agree that the president sets the policy as commander in chief as you testified previously?\" Stefanik asked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Vindman replied.\n\nIn another exchange, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, appeared to mock Vindman for correcting Rep. Devin Nunes, the top GOP member on the committee, on referring to him by his military rank instead of \u201cMr. Vindman.\u201d\n\n\"Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?\" Stewart asked.\n\nThe Purple Heart recipient said he was dressed in uniform, which is required for active duty officers appearing before Congress, and felt it was appropriate. He then added that the attacks he faced both in media and on Twitter \u201cmarginalized\u201d the fact he was a military officer.\n\nSteve Castor, the lead Republican lawyer for the impeachment hearing, pressed Vindman about whether he was offered the position of Ukraine\u2019s defense minister three times by Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nCastor\u2019s line of questioning appeared to raise questions about Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the U.S., but the national security aide said he \u201cimmediately dismissed the offers,\u201d adding that he reported it up the chain of command.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American. I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers, did not entertain them.\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThe whole notion is rather comical.\u201d\n\nDanylyuk told The Daily Beast on Tuesday the pair laughed over the offer and that it \u201cwas clearly a joke.\u201d\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nVindman said he knew risk of testifying\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., got Vindman to sum up his testimony by asking for his first impression of the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThere was probably an element of shock.\u201d\n\nMaloney asked whether Vindman was worried about stepping forward to testify.\n\n\u201cI knew there was going to be a lot of risk,\u201d Vindman said.\n\nBut he said he was confident in the United States.\n\n\u201cHere right matters,\u201d Vindman said, to scattered applause.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nJordan: 'the facts are on the president's side'\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio closed the Republican questioning in the morning hearing by arguing that Democrats have tried to oust President Donald Trump since he was elected in November 2016, first with an FBI investigation of his campaign that found no collusion with Russia, then with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and now with the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut Jordan said the 63 million Americans who elected Trump could see through the unfairness of the process.\n\n\u201cThis is scary what these guys are putting this country through. It is sad, it is scary and it is wrong,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe facts are on the president\u2019s side. The process certainly is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, here,\u201d said somebody in the audience.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nStewart presses Vindman over title\n\nThroughout the hearings, Republicans sparred with Vindman, needling him over his reputation and peppering him with questions about his role in U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, appeared to take issue with Vindman's exchange with Rep. Devin Nunes, in which he corrected the top Republican on referring to him by his military rank instead of \"Mr. Vindman.\"\n\nStewart noted that Vindman typically wears a suit to the White House and chose to wear his uniform to the hearing. Active duty service members are required to wear their uniforms when appearing before Congress.\n\nStewart then sharply asked: \"Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?\"\n\nThe Purple Heart recipient noted he was dressed in uniform and thought it would be \"more appropriate.\" When Stewart continued to press Vindman, he added that \"the attacks I've had in the press and Twitter have kind of eliminated the fact that, either, or marginalized me as a military officer.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just telling you that the ranking member meant no disrespect to you,\u201d Stewart said. Vindman agreed he did not think Nunes meant any disrespect.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump on Vindman\n\nTrump, who mocked Vindman for wearing his uniform last week in closed-door testimony, noted the exchange between Nunes and Vindman during his cabinet meeting.\n\nWhen asked about today's hearing, Trump said of Vindman: \"I don't know him. I don't know, as he says, 'Lt. Colonel.' I understand somebody had him the misfortune of calling him 'Mr.' and he corrected them. I never saw the man. I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in. No, I don't know Vindman at all.\"\n\nThe president watched Vindman\u2019s testimony for a while this morning, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to let people make their own determination.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these people are talking about they heard a conversation, a conversation of another conversation that was had by the president. What\u2019s going on is a disgrace, and it\u2019s an embarrassment to our nation,\" he said before going after the House speaker. \"And in the meantime, we can\u2019t get USMCA approved because Nancy Pelosi is grossly incompetent. She\u2019s incompetent, and you\u2019re about to find that out.\u201d\n\n- David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nCastro jokes about identical twins\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, whose identical twin brother Julian Castro is a Democratic presidential candidate, joked with lieutenant colonel about the fact his twin brother was at the hearing.\n\n\u201cIt is nice to talk to a fellow identical twin, and I hope that your brother is nicer to you than mine is me, and doesn't make you grow a beard,\u201d he said, to laughter from the audience.\n\nYevgeny Vindman, also a National Security Council official, is sitting in the audience at today\u2019s hearing.\n\nWitnesses deny partisan affiliation\n\nBoth witnesses were asked by Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., if they would consider themselves \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d in response to previous tweets by the president attacking Williams and other witnesses.\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure I know an official definition of a Never Trumper,\" Williams said, \u201cI would not, no.\"\n\n\"Representative, I call myself 'never partisan,'\" Vindman said.\n\n\u201cTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just-released statement from Ukraine,\u201d Trump tweeted Nov. 17. \u201cThen she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nAccusations of leaking\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that Timothy Morrison, a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, who is scheduled to testify Tuesday afternoon, told lawmakers during his closed-door deposition that some officials had questioned Vindman\u2019s judgment and that Morrison worried he might leak information.\n\n\u201cAny idea why they have those impressions?\u201d Jordan said.\n\nVindman read a July performance evaluation from Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Fiona Hill, who is scheduled to testify Thursday and described Vindman as \u201cbrilliant,\" \u201cunflappable\u201d and someone who \u201cexercised excellent judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you get the idea,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cI can\u2019t say why Mr. Morrison questioned my judgment.\u201d\n\nVindman also denied ever leaking information.\n\n\u201cI never did, never would,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThat is preposterous that I would do that.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nVindman getting military protection\n\nVindman\u2019s involvement in the impeachment inquiry has prompted the Army to provide protection to him and his family.\n\n\"The Army is providing supportive assistance to help Lt. Col. Vindman with the public attention,\u201d said Col. Kathy Turner, an Army spokeswoman. \u201cAs a matter of practice, the Army would neither confirm nor deny any safety or security measures taken on behalf of an individual; however, as we would with any soldier, the Army will work with civilian authorities to ensure that he and his family are properly protected.\"\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTensions over identity of whistleblower\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, questioned Williams and Vindman on whether they leaked information regarding Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nThe Republican then pressed Vindman on whether he knows anyone who discussed the phone call with members of the media. Vindman directed Nunes to the NSC communications office before saying he did not know anyone.\n\nWhen Nunes asked if either witness discussed the call with anyone outside the White House, Vindman said he discussed the call with State Department Deputy Secretary George Kent and an individual in the intelligence community.\n\nNunes asked who the member of the intelligence community was, prompting Schiff to interject to ensure it was not an attempt to out the whistleblower, whose letter about the call sparked the impeachment probe. Vindman said he was advised by his lawyer not to identify anyone when asked about members of the intelligence community.\n\nNunes continued to press Vindman to identify the member of the intelligence community he spoke to but the National Security Council aide refused to concede. Tensions grew as Vindman's lawyer intervened to say his client was not going to answer the question while Schiff supported the decision, arguing that it appeared Nunes was attempting to identify the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that this is not an attempt to out the whistleblower,\u201d said Schiff, who said the whistleblower is protected with anonymity by law.\n\nNunes stated Vindman had testified that he didn\u2019t know who the whistleblower was.\n\n\u201cI do not know who the whistleblower is,\u201d Vindman said.\n\nNunes then asked how it was possible he could identify the whistleblower, if he didn\u2019t know the name.\n\n\u201cSir, under advice of my counsel, I have been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community,\u201d Vindman said.\n\nNunes reminded Vindman that he was testifying at the Intelligence Committee, to laughter in the audience. But Vindman declined to answer.\n\n\u201cUnder advice of my counsel and instructions of the chairman, I have been advised not to provide any specifics on who I have spoken to inside the intelligence community,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cBut I can offer that these people were properly cleared individuals with a need to know.\u201d\n\nNunes said Republicans had tried to subpoena the whistleblower, but the motion was tabled by committee Democrats. Nunes ended his questioning by calling the hearings an \u201cimpeachment inquisition.\u201d\n\nA woman in the gallery gasped when Schiff told the room not to out the whistleblower and other members of the audience raised their heads to get a better look at the exchange.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" said Mar Roberts of Washington, D.C., who gasped when the topic of the whistleblower came up because, she said, that's a statutory issue. Roberts, 68, who was taking detailed notes on her phone, said she also attended the Watergate impeachment hearings.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian and Bart Jansen\n\nVindman says Ukrainians offered him defense minister position\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Vindman if the Ukrainians offered him the position of defense minister.\n\nVindman said he \u201cimmediately dismissed\u201d the three offers and notified his superiors and counterintelligence officials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American. I came here when I was a toddler, and I immediately dismissed these offers. I did not entertain them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny for a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, which isn\u2019t really that senior, to be offered that illustrious of a position.\n\n\u201cJust to be clear, there were two other staff officers, embassy Kyiv staff officers that were sitting next to me when this offer was made,\u201d Vindman said. One of the officers, Vindman said, was David Holmes, who testified behind closed doors last Friday.\n\nA member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told reporters during a recess that lawmakers weren\u2019t challenging Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the U.S.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any reason to question his loyalty, and I don\u2019t think anyone on the committee is either, but I think we need to see the entire picture,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThe American people need to see what happens in these discussions with foreign governments and the people who work for our government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested the offer to Vindman was an example of how foreign governments try to \"curry favor\" with U.S. officials.\n\nPerry said testimony revealed that Vindman disagreed with U.S. officials about whether Trump\u2019s call for investigations coincided with national-security interests.\n\n\u201cThe president will decide that,\u201d Perry said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Bart Jansen\n\nVindman corrects Nunes on his rank\n\nVindman corrected Nunes after the Republican referred to him as \u201cmister,\u201d rather than by his military rank.\n\n\u201cMr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistle-blower,\u201d Nunes started to ask.\n\n\"Ranking Member, it's Lt. Col. Vindman, please,\" Vindman responded.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nVindman: Trump request sounded like a demand\n\nIn response to questions from Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., NSC aide Alexander Vindman said he knew without hesitation that he had to report his concerns about the July 25 call to White House lawyers. Vindman said that coming from a military culture, Trump\u2019s request sounded more like a demand than a polite request that Ukraine could disregard.\n\n\u201cIt was inappropriate,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cIt was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this could be an impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge.\u201d\n\nVindman said that given the \"power disparity\" between the United States and Ukraine, it was clear that Trump's request for investigations was more of a demand than a request.\n\n\"The culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it's polite and pleasant, it's not to be taken as a request. It's to be taken as an order,\" Vindman said. \"In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelensky would have to deliver the investigations.\"\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nAide to give classified statement on Pence-Zelensky call\n\nAt the direction of her attorney, Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams declined to answer a question from Schiff about a Sept. 18 call between the vice president and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"The September 18 call is classified,\" said her attorney, adding that Pence\u2019s office had said she could not talk about it in an open setting.\n\nWilliams said she would submit a classified statement to the committee in writing about the call.\n\nRead opening remarks:Statements from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams\n\nA summary from the vice president's office of the call said Pence commended Zelensky\u2019s administration for \"bold action to tackle corruption through legislative reforms, and offered full U.S. support for those efforts.\u201d\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nVindman: 'I was concerned by the call'\n\nNational Security Council aide Alexander Vindman told the House Intelligence Committee he reported his concerns about a July 10 meeting with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. The decorated Army soldier said he privately reported his concerns through official channels out of a sense of duty.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cWhat I heard was inappropriate.\u201d\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nWilliams says she found the July 25 call 'unusual'\n\nJennifer Williams, a State Department official detailed to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office, testified about how she found Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call \u201cunusual\u201d because of the discussion of \u201ca domestic political matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found the July 25 phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did not, however, discuss the call with the vice president or any of her other colleagues.\n\nWilliams also outlined her career in public service as a \u201ccareer officer\u201d rather than a partisan.\n\n\u201cAs a career officer, I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad, in support of the President\u2019s foreign policy objectives,\u201d she said.\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nNunes slams Democrats, news media\n\nNunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, attacked the media and Democrats in his opening statement, slamming \"fake news\" and calling news outlets \"puppets of the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"If you watched the impeachment hearings last week, you may have noticed a disconnect between what you actually saw and the mainstream media accounts describing it,\" Nunes said.\n\n\"With their biased misreporting on the Russia hoax, the media lost the confidence of millions of Americans,\" he added.\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff opens the hearing\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff opened the hearing by noting how both witnesses were on the July 25 call, giving them firsthand knowledge of the events that day.\n\nHe laid out the case Democrats hope to make today as lawmakers debate whether to impeach the president.\n\n\"If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 it will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency,\" Schiff noted.\n\nHow to watch:Testimony begins in Week 2 of public impeachment hearings\n\nBoth witnesses were subpoenaed to appear today, Schiff noted.\n\n\"Today\u2019s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment,\" Schiff said.\n\nHouse Republicans have criticized previous witnesses for their indirect knowledge of events on the call, calling it \"hearsay.\"\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump tweets about stock market\n\nJust before the hearing began, President Donald Trump posted a tweet right before the hearing started, stressing the rise of the stock market.\n\nTrump has previously slammed Vindman on Twitter as a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and urged him to read a transcript of the call. The call occurred during a suspension in providing U.S. military aid to Ukraine, but Trump has insisted he didn\u2019t demand the investigation in exchange for the funding.\n\nAsked on Nov. 3 for evidence that Vindman was a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d the president replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing very soon what comes out.\u201d\n\nSchumer wants protections for whistleblowers\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sent a letter Monday to Defense Secretary Mark Esper urging him to notify all civilian and military personnel of their legal rights to make protected disclosures to Congress free from retaliation. Schumer said Vindman and Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of Defense, who is scheduled to testify Wednesday, have been attacked as traitors in the media.\n\n\u201cBravely, in the face of these shameful attacks, these individuals have still chosen to come forward and tell the truth despite the risk of professional reprisals and threats to their personal safety,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI fear, however, these attacks will only increase after their participation in these public hearings.\u201d\n\nEsper has said the Pentagon has protections for whistleblowers and Vindman \u201cshouldn\u2019t have any fear of retaliation.\u201d\n\nThe hearing begins at 9 a.m.\n\nJennifer Williams also to testify\n\nAlso on Tuesday morning, the committee will hear from Jennifer Williams, a National Security Council aide assigned from the State Department to the office of Vice President Mike Pence. She listened to the July 25 call and provided a memo about the call to Pence, although she couldn\u2019t say whether he read it. She told lawmakers at her closed-door deposition that it was \u201cfolly\u201d to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\n\"I would say that it struck me as unusual and inappropriate,\" Williams said when asked what her own personal reaction to the call was.\n\nAfternoon hearings\n\nTrump has also criticized Williams as a \"Never Trumper.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the panel will hear from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\nRepublicans had asked to hear from Volker and Morrison to compare their testimony to Vindman\u2019s. Volker in his closed-door testimony described Trump's longstanding presumption of corruption in Ukraine. The special envoy also said \"no,\" when asked if Trump asked Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, in contrast to looking for evidence of whether Burisma tried to influence the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"Even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something,\" Volker said.\n\nRepublicans have argued that the dispute about the July 25 call amounts to policy disagreements, and that Trump has the authority to direct foreign policy.\n\nMorrison told lawmakers in his closed-door deposition that he asked National Security Council lawyers to review Trump\u2019s July 25 call because he thought it \u201cwould be damaging\u201d if it \u201cleaked.\u201d\n\nBut Morrison also said the White House chief of staff\u2019s office had informed the Office of Management and Budget that \u201cit was the President\u2019s direction to hold the assistance.\u201d",
