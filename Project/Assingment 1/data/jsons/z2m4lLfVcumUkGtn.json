    "content": "The same Beltway braniacs who assured us that the President was in league with Vladimir Putin and sundry other R\u0215sk\u012b reprobates now claim he has precipitated a constitutional crisis . House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler claims Trump is acting like a \u201c king \u201d by refusing to relitigate the Russia hoax , allow already-interrogated aides to be requestioned , or permit partisan congressional staffers to rummage through his tax and financial records . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concurs that a crisis is at hand : \u201c I do agree with Chairman Nadler because the administration has decided that they \u2019 re not going to honor their oath of office . \u201d\nYet , the \u201c get Trump \u201d crowd is obviously growing increasingly frustrated that Nadler and Pelosi have taken no serious action to resolve the dire threat they claim President Trump poses to the republic . The New York Times , for example , published a column by Michelle Goldberg Friday titled , \u201c If This Is a Constitutional Crisis , Act Like It. \u201d Goldberg suggests that contempt votes against administration officials are all very well and good , but they are primarily symbolic and usually lead to protracted court battles that rarely resolve the crises that initially triggered them . Goldberg argues that Pelosi and Nadler should take more radical measures :\nPelosi is a sharp and pragmatic woman \u2026 But it is incoherent to argue that Trump constitutes an existential threat to the Constitution , and that Congress should wait to use the Constitution \u2019 s primary defense against such a threat.\u2026 In the face of an administration that is trying to amass dictatorial powers , Democrats need to bring to bear all the powers of their own . Trump \u2019 s outright rejection of congressional authority makes impeachment proceedings necessary , but even impeachment alone is not sufficient .\nNote that last bit about impeachment not being \u201c sufficient \u201d to solve the crisis ? Goldberg urges Congress to \u201c enforce its own orders , including by sending out the House \u2019 s sergeant-at-arms to arrest people. \u201d But even Pelosi isn \u2019 t that crazy . She knows only a tiny percentage of the public supports impeaching the President , much less the physical arrest of his Cabinet officials . The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that only 17 percent of the voters support ousting Trump , including only 19 percent of Independents .

He then says they should do so anyway because \u201c it is the right thing to do. \u201d But there is no consensus , even among liberal legal scholars , that we \u2019 re in the midst of a constitutional crisis .
