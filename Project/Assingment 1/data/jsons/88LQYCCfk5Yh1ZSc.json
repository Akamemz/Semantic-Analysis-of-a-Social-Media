    "content": "Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , who became the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court when she was confirmed in 1981 , announced Tuesday that she has been diagnosed with the `` beginning stages of dementia , probably Alzheimer 's disease , '' and `` is no longer able to participate in public life . ''\nIn a letter announcing the diagnosis , O'Connor spent most of her time sharing her passion for civics education , which she wrote she committed herself to soon after retiring from the Supreme Court a dozen years ago .\n`` I feel so strongly about the topic because I \u2019 ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government , and participate actively in their communities , '' she wrote .\nIn summing up her public life , which had included service in the Arizona attorney general 's office , legislature , and courts before her US Supreme Court appointment , O'Connor expressed gratitude .\n`` While the final chapter of my life with dementia may be trying , nothing has diminished my gratitude and deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life , '' she wrote .\n`` As a young cowgirl from the Arizona desert , I never could have imagined that one day I would become the first woman justice on the U.S. Supreme Court , '' she continued . `` I hope that I have inspired young people about civic engagement and helped pave the pathway for women who may have faced obstacles pursuing their careers . ''\nIn her nearly 25 years on the Supreme Court , appointed by former President Ronald Reagan , O'Connor often served as the swing vote on major issues \u2014 but also in key moments , like when she cast her vote with the conservatives in ending the 2000 presidential election with the court 's decision in Bush v. Gore .\nRather than charting out a direct , constant path for the court to take , her decisions on hot-button social issues often reflected the specifics of the case or the changing of the times . She voted to uphold affirmative action in a university setting in a 5-4 decision in 2003 after having written a key decision in 1995 that subjected federal government affirmative action programs to strict scrutiny \u2014 meaning they likely would not be upheld . She , along with Justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter , reaffirmed a woman 's right to an abortion in a pivotal 1992 5-4 decision \u2014 after having written what many thought of as a roadmap for overturning Roe v. Wade in a dissenting opinion in 1983 . On gay rights , O'Connor joined the majority opinion upholding Georgia 's sodomy law on a 5-4 vote in 1986 \u2014 but later voted in 2003 to strike down Texas 's sodomy law in an opinion holding that state laws focused only on same-sex sodomy violated equal protection guarantees .\nIn a statement , Chief Justice John Roberts praised O'Connor 's commitment to civic life .\n`` I was saddened to learn that Justice Sandra Day O \u2019 Connor , like many Americans , faces the challenge of dementia . But I was not at all surprised that she used the occasion of sharing that fact to think of our country first , and to urge an increased commitment to civics education , a cause to which she devoted so much of her time and indomitable energy , '' he said . `` Although she has announced that she is withdrawing from public life , no illness or condition can take away the inspiration she provides for those who will follow the many paths she has blazed .
