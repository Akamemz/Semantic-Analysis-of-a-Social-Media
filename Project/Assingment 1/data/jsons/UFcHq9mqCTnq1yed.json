    "content": "Three months ago today , President Obama woke up to the news that US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans had been murdered during a terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi . The president had been informed that an active attack was underway the night before -- but how actively he followed the developing raid , and what ( if any ) orders he issued , remains a mystery . On September 12 , the president skipped his daily intelligence briefing and flew to Las Vegas for a campaign rally . This much we know . The Obama campaign eventually accused Republicans of `` politicizing '' the massacre by asking questions about it , asserting that the `` entire reason '' it was a major national story was due to rank exploitation of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan . Even with the president 's re-election safely tucked away , the White House has continued to defend its UN Ambassador ( and possible Secretary of State in waiting ) against charges that she dissemminated false information to mislead the public about the true nature of the deadly attack . The president and his top lieutenants have repeatedly dodged difficult questions , changed their stories , and hidden behind the dubious fig leaf of `` ongoing investigations . '' Obama has vowed to track down those responsible for the atrocities and bring them to justice . He has also stated his desire to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi that night . The federal investigation into the attacks got off to a stupefyingly dreadful start , and three months later , justice and accountability remain in short supply :\nThree months after Ambassador Christopher Stevens , a diplomat and two CIA contractors were murdered in Benghazi , there is no sign of the killers being brought to justice by the United States .

None of the suspects has been arrested or killed and some have fled Libya . Last month , the FBI issued a global appeal asking anyone with information about the killers to send information in an e-mail , text message or via Facebook . Stevens , the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979 , diplomat Sean Smith and CIA contractors and former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods , were killed in an attack on the U.S. consultate in Benghazi on September 11 .
