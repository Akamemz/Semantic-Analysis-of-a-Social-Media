The show \u2019 s 21st season premieres on Sept. 26 . ( Photo by : Virginia Sherwood/NBC )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) \u2014 That familiar \u201c cha-CHUNG \u201d sound effect from the opening credits of \u201c Law & Order : Special Victims Unit \u201d this Thursday will signal the debut of a new season and something else \u2014 TV history .\nThe show \u2019 s 21st season launch makes it the longest running prime-time live-action series in U.S. TV history and will finally fulfill a goal that eluded show creator Dick Wolf nine years ago with the original \u201c Law & Order . \u201d\nHis hope now ? Twenty-five seasons , of course . \u201c You keep pushing the goal posts back because you don \u2019 t get dealt these hands very often , obviously , \u201d Wolf told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It \u2019 s a continuous thrill to be able to do it . \u201d\nThe Mariska Hargitay-led \u201c SVU \u201d now pulls ahead of \u201c Gunsmoke \u201d and the original \u201c Law & Order , \u201d which are tied with 20 . ( \u201c Gunsmoke \u201d still has more total number of episodes , while \u201c The Simpsons , \u201d an animated prime-time series , exceeds them both . )\nThe new record is a feather in the cap for a towering figure in TV history , who last year alone produced five shows that attracted 50 million viewers . More than 150 billion minutes were viewed of \u201c SVU \u201d alone , shown on NBC , USA , ION and Hulu . When everyone \u2019 s talking about streaming , he \u2019 s still a network guy .\n\u201c The brilliance of Dick Wolf is that he still does appreciate and value the power of broadcast television , \u201d said George Cheeks , co-chairman of NBC Entertainment . \u201c He sees the digital experience as an extension of the way to tell stories but launching them on a broadcast network is the anchor that allows other platforms and other ways for people to experience this content . \u201d\nWolf was a New York ad man who left the business in 1976 and moved to Los Angeles to write scripts . He joined the writing team of the revered \u201c Hill Street Blues \u201d and then raised eyebrows when he jumped to the moody , unpredictable \u201c Miami Vice . \u201d\n\u201c A lot of people said , \u2018 How can you go from the best show on television to a cartoon ? \u2019 I said , \u2018 Well , it \u2019 s a new era , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c The stories weren \u2019 t ripped from the headline but ripped from the zeitgeist . \u201d\nSince then , he \u2019 s created a staggering amount of TV . Some didn \u2019 t last \u2014 like \u201c Mann & Machine , \u201d featuring a robot cop \u2014 but he struck gold with \u201c Law & Order , \u201d which sparked spinoffs such as \u201c SVU , \u201d \u2033Criminal Intent , \u201d \u2033Trial by Jury \u201d and versions set in the United Kingdom and Los Angeles .\nWolf has also created the so-called TV three-stack \u2014 filling Wednesday nights on NBC with back-to-back-to-back hours of \u201c Chicago \u201d dramas , featuring police , doctors and firefighters . \u201c It \u2019 s a mini-binge , \u201d Wolf said . \u201c I think it \u2019 s a repeatable formula. \u201d ( His output also includes the procedural \u201c FBI \u201d on CBS and its upcoming spinoff \u201c Most Wanted . \u201d )\nWolf has triumphed with both actor churn and deep stability . \u201c Law & Order \u201d was a six-person ensemble that employed 29 actors during its 20 years , none of whom lasted the entire run . On the other hand , Hargitay has been on \u201c SVU \u201d since the start , making her Lt. Olivia Benson the longest-running prime-time drama character of all-time .\n\u201c I hate to sound cold-blooded , but I usually see recasting as not a disaster but an opportunity . Knock wood , most of the time , it \u2019 s worked out that way , \u201d said Wolf . \u201c If you get the right person in there , it works for years . If you get the wrong person , in there , they \u2019 re usually gone after a season . \u201d\nThe achievement by \u201c SVU \u201d is even more remarkable since it survived its season 13 transition from a two-hander \u2014 with Hargitay partnered with actor Christopher Meloni \u2014 into a star vehicle for Hargitay .\n\u201c When Chris left the show , everybody thought it was the end of the show . Most people thought the year after would be the last year . Mariska more than stepped up , \u201d said Wolf . \u201c She is the spark plug , the leader , the face of the show . \u201d\nSome didn \u2019 t think a TV show that deals with sex crimes would have enough material to last this long but rapper and actor Ice-T , who has been with the show for 20 years , said it taps into something that fans need .\n\u201c Sexual abuse is out of control and it always has been , \u201d he said . \u201c A lot of people have actually been through this . I think it \u2019 s part show , part therapy . Maybe they didn \u2019 t get justice in their life , but they look for justice on the TV show . \u201d\nPaul Telegdy , the other co-chairman of NBC Entertainment , said his older daughters watch \u201c SVU \u201d and are stunned to see in reruns topics of sexual misconduct addressed long before the # MeToo movement took off .\n\u201c They watch it and they can not believe how of-its-time even the older episodes were , how fresh and relevant it is , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s had an incredible social role . \u201d\nBeing a guest star on a Wolf show is a rite of passage and everyone from James Earl Jones to Julia Roberts has been featured .
