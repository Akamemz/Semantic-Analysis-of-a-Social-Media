This proposal would instead seek to rescind funds that had been authorized in previous fiscal years , but not spent .\nThe official said Mr. Trump plans to propose rescinding money from the March deal in a future proposal , the official said . Mr. Trump had threatened to veto the March spending measure but decided to sign it and avoid shutting down the government . The senior administration official said Monday the rescissions proposal headed for Capitol Hill Tuesday would be the first in a series of proposals to cut funding .\nThe most controversial element of the proposal coming Tuesday is likely to be $ 7 billion in proposed cuts to the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program , which enjoys strong , bipartisan support . The federal-state program provides health coverage to more than eight million low-income , uninsured children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid .\nThe White House proposal would rescind $ 7 billion from that program , of which $ 5 billion would come from funds where the authority to spend them has expired . An additional $ 2 billion would come from a contingency fund that isn \u2019 t projected to be tapped by states , the senior administration official said .\nThe White House said it believed the cuts wouldn \u2019 t affect the insurance program \u2019 s operations , but Democrats didn \u2019 t agree .\nDemocrats said that the contingency funds were necessary in case CHIP enrollment were to surge unexpectedly and the program , whose funding isn \u2019 t open ended , suddenly needed more money .\n\u201c President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program , hurting middle-class families and low-income children , to appease the most-conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) said in a statement .\nUnder the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 , Mr. Trump will be able to temporarily freeze funding for 45 days , but can \u2019 t rescind it on his own unless Congress agrees .\nHis proposal will head first to the House . Once drafted into a bill , the rescissions package can be considered under an expedited process and would only need a simple majority to pass both chambers . Most bills need 60 votes to pass the Senate , where Republicans hold only 51 of the chamber \u2019 s 100 seats . Sen. John McCain ( R. , Ariz. ) , who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year , has been recuperating at home since December .\nSenate Republicans said they were more optimistic the new rescissions proposal could pass the Senate , since the White House isn \u2019 t currently seeking to roll back the spending bill , which was negotiated by the top congressional leaders from both parties . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) had said he wasn \u2019 t interested in reversing spending that had been previously agreed to and signed into law .\n\u201c My understanding is it doesn \u2019 t attempt to repeal anything that was part of the agreed-to package , so I think it has a better chance , taking that approach , \u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R. , Texas ) said Monday .\nCongress isn \u2019 t required to take action in response to Mr. Trump \u2019 s proposal of spending cuts . If lawmakers haven \u2019 t taken any action , the funding would remain intact , according to the Congressional Research Service .\nThe White House also will propose cutting funds that were previously authorized for two technology loan programs .\nIn addition , the administration is hoping to roll back funds set aside for responding to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak , now declared over , for a railroad unemployment-insurance-benefits program that expired and for Hurricane Sandy-related emergency watershed programs .
