Even Trump surrogates were not prepared to answer it . Sean Spicer literally hid in the bushes ( sorry , among the bushes ) .\nThe thing is , the answer is pretty obvious . The implications are terrifying , but the motivations are not complicated .\nHe was mad that people on his TV keep talking about the Russia investigation . He was mad Comey didn \u2019 t back him up on his ludicrous claims that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower , even when people on his TV were criticizing him for it . He was mad Comey hasn \u2019 t been more loyal , convinced Comey was to blame for his bad ratings . So he fired Comey .\nThat \u2019 s the picture the Washington Post paints ( with 30 sources ! ) , as well as Politico . But it remains extremely difficult to accept or internalize .\nWhy is it so hard to accept that Trump is acting out of pique , on impulse , because Comey on his TV gave him bad feels ?\nIn child psychology , \u201c theory of mind \u201d refers to a basic capacity humans develop around the age of 2 or 3 to recognize that other people are independent agents , distinct minds , with their own beliefs , desires , fears , etc . We learn to \u201c read \u201d behaviors as evidence of those internal states .\nAnd because we are relentless pattern seekers , we are constantly developing theories of people , seeking to explain what they do through reference to their beliefs and plans .\nThis has badly misled us with Trump . Much of the dialogue around him , the journalism and analysis , even the statements of his own surrogates , amounts to a desperate attempt to construct a Theory of Trump , to explain what he does and says through some story about his long-term goals and beliefs .\nWe badly want to understand Trump , to grasp him . It might give us some sense of control , or at least an ability to predict what he will do next .\nBut what if there \u2019 s nothing to understand ? What if there \u2019 s no there there ? What if our attempts to explain Trump have failed not because we haven \u2019 t hit on the right one , but because we are , theory-of-mind-wise , overinterpreting the text ?\nIn short , what if Trump is exactly as he appears : a hopeless narcissist with the attention span of a fruit fly , unable to maintain consistent beliefs or commitments from moment to moment , acting on base instinct , entirely situationally , to bolster his terrifyingly fragile ego .\nThere is clearly something wrong with Trump . But exactly what he is \u2014 or , if you prefer to medicalize it , what he has \u2014 is a matter of some controversy .\nIn a recent Rolling Stone article , Alex Morris explores the battle within the field of psychiatry over whether to diagnose Trump at a distance . ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s own Brian Resnick also has a great piece on it . )\nThe nub of the disagreement comes down to whether Trump has a disorder .\nThere are nine traits used to identify narcissistic personality disorder ( things like \u201c requires excessive admiration \u201d and \u201c has a grandiose sense of self-importance \u201d ) . Fitting five or more is considered sufficient for diagnosis . All nine describe Trump \u2019 s public behavior with eerie accuracy .\nBut a disorder , by definition , inhibits normal functioning , impedes success . And Trump is inarguably successful . He \u2019 s one of the most powerful people in the world . Whatever kind of personality he may have , some psychiatrists argue , he can \u2019 t have a disorder . He \u2019 s doing well for himself .\nWhether you see this as evidence of Trump \u2019 s fitness or evidence of the power of inherited wealth in America , I \u2019 m not sure it makes much difference from a citizen \u2019 s point of view . Whether or not Trump has NPD , he clearly has the NP part .\nLike all extreme narcissists , he feels a gnawing sense of inadequacy and thus requires constant adulation , admiration , and reinforcement for his oversize , hypersensitive ego . Like all extreme narcissists , he is exquisitely attuned to offense , to any hint of being the dominated party or the loser , and incredibly vengeful when he feels he \u2019 s been crossed ( which is frequently ) .\nLike all extreme narcissists , he sees every interaction , every situation , as a zero-sum contest in which there will be winners and losers . Like all extreme narcissists , he is prone to building a fantasy world in which he is always on top , always the winner . And like all extreme narcissists , he sees other people only through the lens of how they reflect or affect him .\nBut Trump is not merely a narcissist . There are other things going on .\nMany narcissists are quite well-regulated . Using other people to one \u2019 s advantage takes not only in-the-moment charm but an ability to think ahead , as in a game of chess . Succeeding requires fooling other people , and fooling other people requires an ability to hold a complex social map in one \u2019 s head , to sustain a consistent performance over time .\nTrump does have some crude cunning to manipulate people in the moment . He can sense what they want and what will elicit their approval .\nBut he lacks any ability to hold beliefs , commitments , or even deceptions in his head across contexts . ( On Twitter , I compared him to a goldfish . ) He is utterly unable to step back and put his gut emotions in larger perspective , to see himself as a person among people , in social contexts that demand some adaptation . He is impatient with attempts to influence him to take a larger view \u2014 he demands one-page memos , for instance .\nMatt Yglesias says that Trump lies all the time . And it \u2019 s certainly true that he says false things all the time . But even to say \u201c lie \u201d seems to suggest a certain self-awareness , an ability to distinguish performance from reality , that Trump shows no signs of possessing .\nTrump does have consistent attitudes , and that has given his actions some consistency . Above all , he is utterly terrified of , and hostile to , weakness .\nFear of weakness helps explain why Trump mocked John McCain for being taken prisoner , why he mocked a disabled reporter , why he \u2019 s been so consistently racist . Somewhere in his reptile brain , he views being captured , disabled , or persecuted as weakness , as being dominated .\nIt also explains his fondness for autocratic strongmen \u2014 the ones who dominate .\nBut these attitudes , these instincts , do not seem to yield persistent beliefs or principles . Trump is highly attuned to dominance and submission in the moment , but each moment is a new moment , unconstrained by prior commitments , statements , or actions .\nTrump defies our theory of mind because he appears to lack a coherent , persistent self or worldview . He is a raging fire of need , protected and shaped by a lifetime of entitlement , with the emotional maturity and attention span of a 6-year-old , utterly unaware of the long-term implications of his actions .\nWe are not accustomed to having someone so obviously disordered in a position of such power . Trump is surrounded by people \u2014 not only members of his administration but Congress , the press , pundits , conservative ideological groups , industry lobbyists \u2014 eager to invent stories to make sense of his behavior .\nPoliticos and journalists need a story in which Trump \u2019 s stumbling and grasping can be construed as a savvy media strategy , a \u201c distraction \u201d from some other wrongdoing he has going on , or a \u201c pivot \u201d from his current omnishambles . Those are all versions of political maneuvering with which they are familiar . They need for Trump to want things , to be after things , to have a plan .\nPoliticians , journalists , analysts , the public \u2014 everyone wants some kind of story , some Theory of Trump . And so Trump surrogates try to provide it , scrambling to weave a coherent narrative around his careening , erratic lies .\nBut there \u2019 s no there there . He \u2019 s lunging this way and that , situation by situation . Firing Comey ? Trump just got mad . He wanted Comey and the Russia investigation off his TV . There \u2019 s no deeper story than that .\nThis is an utterly terrifying conclusion . A Machiavellian Trump \u2014 one who was merely acting the fool , manipulating the public and media in service of some diabolical long-term agenda \u2014 is less frightening than a purely narcissistic and impulsive one .\nNo agenda guides him , no past commitments or statements restrain him , so no one , not even his closest allies ( much less the American public or foreign governments ) can trust him , even for a second . He will do what makes him feel dominant and respected , in the moment , with no consideration of anything else , not because he has chosen to reject other considerations , but because he is , by all appearances , incapable of considering them .\nThis makes him , as many others have noted , extremely vulnerable to being manipulated by whoever happens to talk to him last , whoever butters him up and makes him feel important . ( And that includes the TV . )\nIt \u2019 s one thing when that involves a wild Twitter accusation or the firing of a staff member . All Trump \u2019 s crises so far have been internal and self-inflicted , more or less .\nBut what will happen when he gets into a confrontation with North Korea , when Kim Jong Un deliberately provokes him ? Will his response be considered and strategic ? Will he be able to get information and aid from allies ? Will he be able to make and keep commitments during negotiations ?\nMore likely he will prove , as he has in literally every confrontation of the past several years , congenitally unable to back down or deescalate , even if doing so is clearly in everyone \u2019 s best interests .\nMore likely he will be desperate to maintain face and will listen to whatever his security staff whispers in his ear .\nMore likely he will make rash and fateful decisions with insufficient consultation and no clear plan .\nThat \u2019 s who he is : a disregulated bundle of impulses , being manipulated by a cast of crooks and incompetents , supported by a Republican Party willing to bet the stability of the country against upper-income tax cuts . We need to stop looking for a more complicated story .",
