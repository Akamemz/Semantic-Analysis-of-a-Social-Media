Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 20 , 2018\nShortly after his outburst , the Justice Department said its inspector general had been asked to assess whether there was any political impropriety in the use of the confidential source , as part of an existing probe into aspects of the Russia investigation .\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who is overseeing Mueller 's activities , said in a statement , `` If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes , we need to know about it and take appropriate action .

That action could potentially force senior officials in the department to consider whether to remain in their positions .\nWere Rosenstein to resign under pressure for instance , it could help Trump if he is able to eventually install an official that might be hostile to the Mueller investigation .\nThere appears to be nothing illegal in Trump 's demand for a Justice Department investigation -- just as in practice , he had the authority to fire FBI Director James Comey last year .\nBut some critics believe that Trump 's repeated pattern of leaning on the Justice Department and the FBI over the Russia investigation could come close to showing intent that could amount to obstruction of justice .\nEven the fact that Rosenstein asked the inspector general -- the internal Justice Department watchdog -- to get involved , puzzled some analysts .\nCNN legal analyst Paul Callan said that he found it `` bizarre '' that Rosenstein acted on an order to start an investigation via tweet .\n`` I mean , would n't the President call him in ?
