Defenders of capitalism warn that a tax-the-rich policy agenda could end up harming the overall economy .\nAt the turn of the 20th century , an ultra-wealthy financier helped bail the United States out of financial crisis . Now , more than 100 years later , Jeff Bezos , the second-wealthiest man in the world , has pledged an astronomical sum \u2013 $ 10 billion \u2013 toward addressing a climate crisis in the absence of federal leadership . But at the same time , a billionaire backlash is surging in response to both President Donald Trump ( the first billionaire occupant of the White House ) and current presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg .\nThe United States was at the precipice of a financial crisis \u2013 and the wealthy and well-connected worked out a plan to avert disaster .\nThat was the narrative in 1907 , as John Pierpont Morgan brought fellow financiers into a room and coaxed them to prop up a tottering banking system . Their action eased a potentially devastating financial panic . But it also troubled many Americans by revealing how , even within an already mighty nation , a relative few wielded extraordinary power .\nToday , those concerns still resonate . They punctuated the 2016 presidential race when candidate Donald Trump poured $ 66 million into his campaign and went on to become the first billionaire president in the United States . Last week they became especially pointed in a Democratic presidential debate , as a billionaire candidate on stage confronted another candidate \u2019 s assertion that \u201c billionaires should not exist . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re in this populist moment , and the populist sentiments are playing out in different ways , \u201d says David Callahan , editor of Inside Philanthropy . Where President Trump has tapped into anger at the media and coastal elites \u2013 even while being a person of big wealth himself \u2013 on the left \u201c Bernie Sanders is really tapping into anger at the billionaires and wealth inequality , also taking on his party establishment . \u201d\nAt the same time , another American billionaire is throwing his wealth behind one of the pressing problems of the day . Jeff Bezos , the world \u2019 s second-richest person pledged an astronomical sum \u2013 $ 10 billion \u2013 toward addressing a climate crisis in the absence of federal leadership .\nNo one thinks the money of Amazon founder Mr. Bezos or even other billionaires could by itself become a viable solution to climate change . But , as 100 years ago , the financial and political power of the very rich today is stunning . And , although the public mood isn \u2019 t one of complete hostility toward wealth and big-money philanthropy , there are signs of heightened questioning of that power .\nAll this is very different from the mood that prevailed when , in 2005 , Time magazine named Bill and Melinda Gates \u201c Persons of the Year \u201d along with rock star Bono for their varied efforts in global philanthropy . It \u2019 s not that the mega-rich faced no scrutiny then or that actions to rein in their wealth and power are inevitable now . But the throes of a modern-day financial crisis , an era of financial struggle for average Americans , and an ongoing rise in big wealth have all contributed to a shift .\n\u201c The billionaire backlash is part of this larger populist moment that we \u2019 ve been living in since the tea party and Occupy Wall Street in 2010 and 2011 , \u201d Mr. Callahan says .\nEven as the sheer number of billionaires has surged in recent years , so has their ability to translate money into influence . For instance , U.S. Supreme Court rulings like the 2010 Citizens United case have removed constraints on political giving .\nWhether wielded through political spending , philanthropy , or their business decisions , the influence of the rich often occurs with little direct accountability to the voting public .\n\u201c This is a huge issue , \u201d says Alexandra Acker-Lyons , who advises individual campaign donors in California and her home state of Colorado .\nOne example of the potential for disconnects : Polls show broad public support for higher taxes on the rich , even among Republicans . Yet the 2017 tax cuts reduced taxes on the wealthy , even as President Trump said the measure would be \u201c bad \u201d for his own personal finances . ( He has not disclosed his personal taxes to the public . )\n\u201c The issue of income inequality and of equity generally has risen \u201d as a priority , says Ms. Acker-Lyons , as members of her party increasingly see interconnections with other big issues the nation faces , such as climate change . \u201c People are just seeing it in their daily lives . \u201d\nIn her own life , it means she is supporting Elizabeth Warren as a presidential candidate , even though the senator from Massachusetts is seeking campaign finance reforms that , symbolically at least , seek to put Ms. Acker-Lyons out of her current job .\nIt \u2019 s not so much that campaign donations necessarily buy direct political results , Ms. Acker-Lyons says . But in her view , Senator Warren understands the unfairness that exists when \u201c money gets you in the room to make your case . \u201d\nThe left \u2019 s currents of outrage were on display on the debate stage in Las Vegas , Nevada , on Feb. 19 . Instead of being welcomed as a big donor to the causes of gun control and combating climate change , billionaire Michael Bloomberg faced relentless criticism in his first appearance alongside the other Democratic candidates in a televised debate .\n\u201c We have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income , \u201d Senator Sanders said at one point . \u201c Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans . That \u2019 s wrong . That \u2019 s immoral . \u201d\nWealth and inequality are nothing new , of course . And the influence of money in society has antecedents dating back to the linkage of voting rights to property ownership in the nation \u2019 s early years .\nBut inequality has widened as corporate fortunes have skyrocketed . When Forbes magazine introduced its \u201c richest 400 \u201d list in 1982 , the top-ranked American was shipping executive Daniel Keith Ludwig , with wealth equal to less than $ 6 billion in today \u2019 s dollars . Today Mr. Bezos and Bill Gates each surpass $ 100 billion .\nDespite the excesses and imperfections , some social scientists warn against a frontal assault on big wealth . They say it could easily backfire , since economic innovation and job creation are tied to inventor and investor ability to profit .\n\u201c Jeff Bezos is fabulously wealthy , but he has captured only a small , small share of the total value that he \u2019 s created for society . So that doesn \u2019 t strike me as unjust at all , \u201d Michael Strain , an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said in a recent podcast .\nIn the debate , as a moderator paraphrased Mr. Sanders to ask , \u201c should you exist ? , \u201d Mr. Bloomberg replied that he \u201c worked very hard \u201d for his fortune . \u201c And I \u2019 m giving it away . \u201d\nEven within the Democratic Party , the concern about inequality is balanced for many by an enduring allegiance to free enterprise \u2013 and a fear that the \u201c socialist \u201d part of Sanders \u2019 self-described democratic socialist agenda might hurt Democrats politically or even damage America \u2019 s economy .\nSimilarly , experts see tension over the role of billionaires in philanthropy .
