So yes , opposing is fine\u2014but winning is better . And winning , as Boehner said , requires the power of a superior alternative .\nContinuing , Boehner added , \u201c We \u2019 ve passed dozens of bills this year to help the economy , to help improve education , improve energy production in America \u201d \u2014but then noted that most of these bills then went into limbo in the Democratically-controlled Senate .\nBoehner also declared , \u201c Republicans have to do more to talk about the better solutions we think we have that will help the American people grow their wages and opportunities at a better job and clearly have a better shot at the American dream . \u201d\nYes , ObamaCare may continue to unravel , and yes , the economy may be softening . Even The New York Times had to concede that the recent jobs report was \u201c a disappointing showing that is likely to spur fears that the labor market is poised for yet another slowdown . ''\nBut the GOP still must demonstrate that it can do more than just say \u201c no. \u201d And so some core Republican ideas are starting to break through .\nFor example , there \u2019 s a decent chance that Obama will approve the Keystone Pipeline . And if he doesn \u2019 t , well , Republicans have effectively framed the Keystone debate as a jobs issue , and jobs are popular ; a recent poll found that 56 percent of Americans support the pipeline , while just 41 percent oppose it . So for the sake of the Democrats in Congress , Obama would be well advised to endorse the pipeline .\nOn another issue as well , the GOP message is breaking through . In his 2014 State of the Union address , Obama called for tax reform , declaring , \u201c Let \u2019 s work together to close those loopholes , end those incentives to ship jobs overseas , and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home . \u201d\nIn other words , lower the rate and broaden the base , in the same way that Ronald Reagan worked with Congressional Democrats to enact tax reform in 1986 . ( I am the co-chair of the RATE Coalition , a bipartisan group working to make the U.S. corporate tax code more competitive . )\nOK , so those are issues that the GOP has traditionally been associated with : more energy production and a more jobs -- and a business-friendly tax code .\nBut Democrats have other issues . For example , there \u2019 s health care , specifically , national health insurance . That \u2019 s been a core Democratic issue , going back to the 1940s , when President Truman first proposed it , later followed , of course , by President Clinton in the 1990s . And without a doubt , the cause of national health insurance helped Obama win in 2008 .\nYet today , the situation has changed ; polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of ObamaCare .\nStill , for Republicans , there \u2019 s the issue of providing an alternative . Can Republicans do it ? The answer seems to be , yes , they can .\nLate last month , Republican Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina , Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , and Orrin Hatch of Utah released a market-oriented alternative to Obamacare , the Patient CARE Act . As Burr explained ,\n\u201c The Patient CARE proposal repeals Obamacare and focuses on targeted reforms that will lower costs and expand access to quality care . We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions , rather than empowering the government to make those decisions for them . \u201d\nThe Burr-Coburn-Hatch legislation has been stopped cold , of course , by the Democratic majority in the Senate .\nYet that could change ; The Washington Post recently reported on a statistical model that showed that the GOP has a better-than-even chance of winning the Senate this November .\nIn the meantime , Burr , Coburn , and Hatch have helped Republican prospects by doing something both intellectually responsible and politically astute : They have put a credible health insurance plan on the table . In other words , the Republicans aren \u2019 t just the party of \u201c no to ObamaCare , \u201d they are the party of \u201c yes to a sound health insurance alternative . \u201d\nWe might further note that health care consists of a lot more than insurance . Even more fundamental is the issue of health itself . As noted here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 Opinion last February , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor spoke out on the value of cures :\n\u201c Long term , controlling health care costs will require smarter federal investments in medical research . Many of today \u2019 s cures and life saving treatments are a result of an initial federal investment . And much of it is spent on cancer research and other grave illnesses . \u201d\nIn other words , medical research and cures are the key to holding down health care costs . The logic is simple : To cite just one medical example , if tens of millions of Americans develop Alzheimer \u2019 s Disease , then the costs will be so astronomical\u2014some $ 1 trillion a year by mid-century\u2014as to overwhelm any kind of health insurance at all , public or private .\nThe blunt reality is this : If current trends continue , treating major diseases is going to be unaffordable . And so that leaves us with only one humane and ethical solution : Don \u2019 t just treat the disease , cure the disease .\nEarlier this month , House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton , ( R-Mich. ) , added his public voice to the cure-cause . Upton took note of a new collaboration between 10 big pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health , aimed at achieving breakthrough cures for dreaded diseases , including Alzheimer \u2019 s , diabetes , lupus , and arthritis .\nThe Wolverine State Republican , who has been a major behind-the-scenes mover in these pro-cure efforts , declared ,\n\u201c The search for cures must be an all-hands-on-deck effort . This landmark effort exemplifies the very best of a public-private collaboration , and we in Congress also want to do what we can in the name of breakthrough research . \u201d\nYes , as Upton said , we need \u201c breakthrough research \u201d leading to cures . A cure , making the illness go away , is infinitely superior to mere care .\nRepublicans now have a double-barreled approach to health care . Thanks to Burr , Coburn , and Hatch , they have a solid ObamaCare alternative . And thanks to Cantor and Upton , they have a new vision of cures and hope .\nFor lots of reasons , including a stronger health care message , things are looking up for the GOP , 2014-wise .\nAfter that , the Republican challenge will be to find a strong messenger who can keep faith with familiar GOP issues while also carrying the new double health care message into the 2016 presidential election .",
