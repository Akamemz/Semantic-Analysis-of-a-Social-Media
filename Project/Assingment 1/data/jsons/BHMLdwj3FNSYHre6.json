How can that be ?\nFor starters , Jeff Bezos is rich because of the value of Amazon stock , but for years , Wall Street loved the company even though it was a curiously unprofitable retail and technology giant . But more recently , Amazon has emerged recently as a consistently profitable firm , reporting nearly $ 11 billion in earnings last year . Yet during this surge into profitability \u2014 the company \u2019 s earnings doubled between 2017 and 2018 \u2014 Amazon \u2019 s tax bill has actually gone down . The company paid $ 0 in corporate income tax last year , according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , an astonishing figure that generated dozens of news stories last week .\nA big part of the story here is the tax treatment of stock-based compensation ( which Amazon offers to most of its employees ) , which has the slightly odd feature that the more successful your company becomes , the lower your tax bill becomes .\nAmazon , in other words , didn \u2019 t manage to avoid paying any corporate income tax in 2018 despite the huge surge in profits but largely because of it . If this seems like a policy failure , though , the real problem is probably not Amazon \u2019 s light tax bill but the extent to which a policy initiative from the early 1990s that was meant to constrain CEO pay has totally backfired .\nAn interesting thing to note here is that Amazon isn \u2019 t lowering its tax bill through classic technology company shenanigans like stashing profits in offshore subsidiaries or declaring itself to be a foreign company . Amazon \u2019 s sales are mostly in the United States , and its No . 2 market is Germany , which is also a relatively high tax jurisdiction .\nAmazon isn \u2019 t cheating anyone here ; it just legitimately owes no taxes .\nSome of that is because Amazon is able to avail itself of the research and development tax credit , a not-very-controversial policy that encourages profitable companies to plow earnings into R & D . Congress routinely extends this on a bipartisan basis , with the thinking that research into innovation is good , and Amazon is obviously a company that does a fair amount of R & D .\nThe second reason is that the Trump tax bill included a temporary provision allowing companies to take a 100 percent tax deduction for investment in equipment . This is a controversial idea , but it has some support across party lines \u2014 Obama White House economist Jason Furman likes it , for example . More broadly , when Democrats complain that companies are plowing too much of their profits into share buybacks rather than investing , they are in effect saying they wished more companies acted like Amazon \u2014 which does not do any share buybacks and does invest a lot \u2014 and this provision of the Trump tax bill encourages companies to do this .\nLast and most significant to understanding the change in 2018 is the fact that companies can deduct the cost of stock-based compensation from their taxable earnings even though it doesn \u2019 t actually cost companies any money to hand out shares of their own stock to employees . What \u2019 s more , the way this cost is estimated is that the more your share price rises , the bigger the deduction for handing out shares . So precisely because Amazon \u2019 s profits surged , the price of the company \u2019 s shares went up a lot and the value of these deductions surged as well .\nThat may sound a little unconventional \u2014 in general , the idea is that more successful firms should pay higher taxes , not lower \u2014 but there \u2019 s a pretty good accounting reason for it . At the same time , the entire tendency of companies to offer executives stock-based compensation packages is essentially a giant loophole in a decades-old tax provision that was supposed to deter lavish executive compensation .\nWay back in 1993 , Bill Clinton and congressional Democrats had an idea to tackle the growing pay inequality of Reagan-era America \u2014 Section 162 ( m ) of the US Tax Code .\nNormally , while companies pay sales taxes to state and local governments , the federal government taxes them on their profits . Revenue that is paid out to employees as salaries and benefits is not profits , and thus doesn \u2019 t get taxed . But section 162 ( m ) created an exception to that rule \u2014 any salary of over $ 1 million paid to top executives would not be deductible for tax purposes . The idea was to deter lavish executive compensation packages . Except there was an exception to the exception \u2014 compensation that took the form of stock options or stock grants would still be deductible .
