That must be why, month after month, on issue after issue, Democrats and their far-left allies have tried to replace inconvenient facts with pure partisan scare tactics.\n\nThe latest installment landed earlier this week. The Senate\u2019s Democratic Leader, Chuck Schumer, published an op-ed that twisted some uncontroversial comments I made about our nation\u2019s long-term need for bipartisan spending reform. Sen.
