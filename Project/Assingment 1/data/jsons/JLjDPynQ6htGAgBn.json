    "content": "Thomas Caldwell was a veteran in his 60s with a soft physique , oval glasses , no income , and a history of mental illness . \u201c I \u2019 ve been schizophrenic all my life , hearing voices , \u201d he once said in a courtroom . He didn \u2019 t have a license to sell firearms , but that hadn \u2019 t stopped him . In 2015 , according to prosecutors , police found a Glock in a Milwaukee drug house and quickly linked it to him . He \u2019 d purchased it only the day before .\nMonths later , an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) confronted Caldwell about the pistol . According to the ATF , he said he had been purchasing guns from a licensed dealer , then reselling many of them through Armslist.com , a website that connects sellers with buyers looking for anything from a pistol to an AR-15 .\nIf Caldwell wanted to sell guns , the ATF warned him , there was a proper way to do it . Without obtaining a federal firearms license , he was breaking the law and potentially putting weapons into the hands of criminals .\nCaldwell didn \u2019 t listen , and he managed to turn flipping guns into a substantial business , prosecutors later said . Between December 2015 and May 2018 , he made cash deposits into his bank account totaling more than $ 19,000 , all from gun sales . Even after his initial run-in with authorities , he kept up the practice for years . In 2017 , Madison police found a Taurus 9mm pistol during an investigation , then traced it back to a purchase Caldwell had made two weeks before .\nEventually , the ATF found that 11 guns recovered by police during investigations had been purchased by Caldwell . Since the ATF \u2019 s 2015 warning , he \u2019 d bought 95 handguns and 11 rifles from 57 different sellers . Caldwell posted more than 200 listings for guns on the website , according to prosecutors , sometimes explicitly noting the weapons were brand-new and unfired .\nAccording to prosecutors , he had said that a license was \u201c too much paperwork \u201d\nOfficials believed the short \u201c time to crime \u201d \u2014 the gap between a sale and when it \u2019 s recovered at a crime scene \u2014 meant Caldwell had become a known source for criminals . A prosecutor would later say a tragedy was \u201c inevitable. \u201d As the Chicago Tribune noted last year , authorities declined to say why he wasn \u2019 t charged much earlier .\nTwo years after he first came to the attention of the ATF , agents organized an undercover sting , buying a Walther .40-caliber pistol from Caldwell on Armslist . But while Caldwell was still under investigation , he sold a weapon on Armslist and , months later , the gun somehow arrived in Chicago . When it did , Police Commander Paul Bauer responded to a call in the Loop and caught up with a suspect . In the struggle that followed , Bauer was shot six times and killed with the gun .\nCaldwell , according to the ATF , described selling guns as an addiction . Police executed a search warrant on his home and uncovered 44 firearms as they kept building their case . Owning a lot of guns is not in itself a crime , and undeterred , Caldwell sold another gun to an undercover investigator on Armslist a month later .\nHe pleaded guilty to illegally selling guns in 2018 , nearly three years after first being warned by the ATF . According to prosecutors , he had said that a license was \u201c too much paperwork . \u201d\nCaldwell isn \u2019 t the only frequent user of Armslist . Over the years , the website has become a major destination for firearm buyers and sellers . The site can be used legally , and its terms of use explicitly direct users to follow applicable firearms laws . Critics , however , say the site \u2019 s operators have taken a hands-off approach to moderating the content on their platform that fuels violence and allows private sellers to bypass getting a federal firearms license .\nLaw enforcement faces legal barriers to policing rogue sellers like Caldwell , but the law has also put Armslist itself out of reach . The same legal protections meant to help the internet flourish have also ensured the guns keep flowing .\n\u201c To protect the good actors , you have to write a standard that allows people to be pretty terrible actors too , \u201d says James Grimmelmann , professor of law at Cornell University . \u201c The challenge is how do you distinguish the good from the terrible actors . \u201d\nUnder federal law , it \u2019 s legal for people to sell guns without a background check . It \u2019 s only when they become \u201c engaged in the business \u201d of selling guns that they are required by law to obtain a license from the ATF and run checks on every sale .\nSo when does selling guns turn from a hobby into a full-fledged business enterprise ? It \u2019 s difficult to tell . One person might , for example , inherit dozens of antiques and sell them without issue . But another person might buy a handful of guns from a registered seller , flip them in private sales without conducting background checks , and be deemed engaged in the business .\nExecutive actions made during the second term of the Obama presidency were supposed to tighten the definition of \u201c engaging in the business. \u201d They state that those \u201c who utilize the Internet or other technologies must obtain a license , just as a dealer whose business is run out of a traditional brick-and-mortar store. \u201d At the time , critics argued that the actions were \u201c legally meaningless \u201d and that they amounted to little more than \u201c political theater . \u201d\n\u201c The president and Congress often charge administrative agencies with very broad and ambitious tasks , and they rarely provide sufficient funding to actually carry them out , \u201d said Timothy Lytton , a distinguished professor of law at Georgia State University who specializes in safety regulation and gun violence .\nThe ambiguity of federal law \u2014 and the fact it is rarely enforced \u2014 leaves it open to exploitation . And Armslist is home to many sellers whose activity falls in a gray area .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Trace scraped more than 2 million Armslist listings from December 2016 through March 2019 to identify users who may be skirting the law through high-volume sales .\n\u201c If someone calls you up and says , \u2018 Hey , I \u2019 d like to buy a gun , \u2019 you should be able to check if the person can have a gun \u201d\nWe searched the text of listings for phone numbers and isolated the numbers that appeared most frequently . Armslist encourages users to communicate through direct messages on the website , but some sellers may include direct contact information in their posts .\nWe identified more than 700 phone numbers that appeared in 10 or more listings . The most used phone number belonged to a seller in South Carolina who was associated with more than 300 listings on Armslist during the period of time covered by our scraping . ( The user denied posting ads on the site , but confirmed their phone number , which was included as contact information on each ad . ) Thirty-eight other phone numbers appeared in 50 or more posts on the site .\nTo determine if sellers were licensed to conduct sales , we compared the contact information in the ads against the publicly available list of federal firearms licenses , which contains registered sellers \u2019 names , addresses , and phone numbers . Only 14 of the phone numbers attached to a high volume of ads appeared in the ATF \u2019 s database .\nThe Trace and \u2588\u2588\u2588 called every phone number linked to 25 or more listings \u2014 nearly 150 in total . We spoke to 10 sellers altogether . None of those sellers said they had a license to deal firearms . Two acknowledged that they used Armslist to turn a profit on sales , while the rest reported using the site primarily to offload firearms in their private collections . \u201c Obviously if you get something and you know can get more for it , you \u2019 re probably just going to turn around and sell it again , \u201d one user said .\nAll of the users we spoke with said they vetted prospective buyers in some way , whether by reading through the person \u2019 s online presence or simply getting a sense of the person while negotiating a sale . But only a handful said they took customers to a licensed firearms dealer to perform a background check before making a sale .\nOne user from Florida , whose phone number was connected to nearly 50 listings , said he didn \u2019 t conduct background checks on sales . But he wished that there was an easy way to review the history of a potential buyer . The user said that some people reaching out through Armslist didn \u2019 t pass a gut check for a firearm transfer .\n\u201c If someone calls you up and says , \u2018 Hey , I \u2019 d like to buy a gun , \u2019 you should be able to check if the person can have a gun , \u201d the Florida user said . \u201c I want to be a responsible gun owner . \u201d\nThe number of posts from a user doesn \u2019 t necessarily match the number of gun sales , and the tool couldn \u2019 t account for duplicate posts . However , for every user we spoke with , we confirmed that their phone numbers appeared in multiple non-duplicate posts on the site .\nWe described our findings to law enforcement officials to get a sense of whether this constituted evidence of sellers being \u201c engaged in the business . \u201d\nA man was convicted of engaging in the business of selling guns without a license , while serving as an FBI agent\nIn a statement , an ATF spokesperson said the agency looks at each case to see \u201c whether there is sufficient evidence of willful misconduct \u201d to prove a violation . \u201c The volume of sales is only one factor in evaluating whether someone is unlawfully engaged in the business , particularly since federal law expressly allows individuals to sell their personal firearms collections without a license , \u201d the spokesperson said . \u201c Numerous additional factors , such as the intent of the seller , must be considered . \u201d\nTo build a case , prosecutors must demonstrate that a person was willfully taking illegal action \u2014 that a seller knew what they were doing was wrong and flouted the law anyway .\n\u201c People who break this law should be prosecuted , \u201d says Thomas Chittum , assistant director of field operations at the ATF . \u201c But it \u2019 s a challenging law to prosecute because of the willfulness requirement and because it \u2019 s very fact-intensive , and sometimes those facts aren \u2019 t readily available . \u201d\nProsecutors have relied on the volume of online listings as evidence in past cases . In 2010 , a man was convicted of engaging in the business of selling guns without a license , while serving as an FBI agent . He had posted nearly 300 online gun ads over more than three years and collected more than $ 118,000 in firearm sales .\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Minnesota Erica MacDonald stifled laughter when asked whether prosecutors might want to scrutinize a seller who had posted hundreds of listings . \u201c Yeah , \u201d she said .\nGuns are sold online in many ways . Retailers like Bass Pro Shops , Brownells , or BudsGunShop.com sell their firearms through company websites , but buyers pick up the guns from licensed dealers . There are also online marketplaces , like GunBroker and GunsAmerica , where the websites directly participate in the transaction in some way and allow for firearm transfers to flow through federal license holders . Then there are places like Armslist that function as an online classified section tailored to guns , and all transactions are done peer to peer .\nThe idea for Armslist formed in the summer of 2007 , when Jonathan Gibbon was a student at the US Air Force Academy , he told the website Human Events . He saw that Craigslist had banned gun listings and thought he could step in to fill the void . So he connected with his classmate Brian Mancini at a Fourth of July party and they put together a basic version of the site .\nSomeone looking to offload a gun can put up a listing on Armslist in minutes and then simply wait for prospective buyers to reach out . With a few clicks , sellers can say where they \u2019 re selling their gun , the make and build , how much it costs , and include an email address for queries . The process is as easy as buying a chair on Craigslist . Many of the users we spoke with said the site \u2019 s simplicity is a big part of its draw .\nWhen a buyer visits a listing , they can learn nearly everything they \u2019 d want to know about their new firearm . Up top , there are pictures of the gun from multiple angles , along with the manufacturer and caliber size . They just need to click on the \u201c contact seller \u201d button to move forward and complete the sale . In some cases , sellers will include a personal cell number .\n\u201c It connects firearm owners and enthusiasts , helping people to find deals on firearms and gear in their local area , \u201d Gibbon told Human Events in 2010 . \u201c Imagine a gun show that never ends , but you need an internet connection . \u201d\nLooking for a pistol ? Machine gun and silencer ? Rocket launcher ? Armslist users are willing to sell you one .\nSince its founding , Armslist has gone on to become one of the most popular gun advertising websites . The site offers nearly any kind of gun you could imagine . Looking for a pistol ? Machine gun and silencer ? Rocket launcher ? Armslist users are willing to sell you one .\nOnce you find what you \u2019 re looking for , just contact the seller and arrange a meetup to finish the transaction . The transfer can take place in a gun store , home , or parking lot . There are no rules on where the handover needs to happen , as long as the timing works for both parties . The process is flexible enough for even the busiest online gun buyer .\nThe business has also become notorious for giving firearm access to people prohibited from owning guns . In a paper published in 2019 , researchers with the University of Minnesota scraped more than 4.9 million Armslist listings from the website and found that less than 10 percent mentioned a background check .\nIn 2011 , Demetry Smirnov , a Russian immigrant living in Canda , illegally purchased a handgun on Armslist and later used it to murder a woman who spurned his romantic advances . Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez , a naturalized US citizen who became a radicalized jihadist , used weapons acquired through Armslist to kill five US service members in Chattanooga , Tennessee in 2015 . In 2018 , a woman who used Armslist to traffic guns was sentenced to 18 months in prison , but before her sentencing , one of her former firearms was used to shoot a police officer in Boston . And last year , federal prosecutors brought a case against an Alabama resident who admitted to trafficking guns acquired through Armslist to New York , California , and Mexico , after he watched a documentary film on gun trafficking in 2016 .\nGun selling that bypasses the background check system through private transactions is commonly called the gun show loophole \u2014 in this case , the gun show just happens to be online . There are only a couple of restrictions : if the seller believes that the gun might be going to a person who is prohibited from owning a firearm or is from outside of their state , they can not legally make the sale .\nThere are no laws that explicitly target the sale of firearms over the internet , and all online sales are supposed to be held to the same legal standards as sales that occur at physical locations . Machine guns , silencers , and other firearms and accessories regulated under the National Firearms Act require fingerprinting and registration with the ATF . Licensed federal firearms dealers are required to perform background checks and maintain records of gun sales .\nAdvocates and the US government have been studying the sale of firearms and gun accessories through Armslist and other online websites for years , but little has changed in terms of how they operate . In February 2019 , the advocacy group Everytown For Gun Safety contacted 150 sellers on Armslist to buy firearms undercover . More than 65 percent of these sellers indicated that they would not require a background check to complete the sale . ( Everytown \u2019 s charitable arm provides funding to The Trace . )\nWhen the ATF finds someone it believes to be illegally selling guns , the agency might , in lieu of immediate prosecution , send a warning letter demanding the person stop selling . A warning letter can lay the groundwork for a case showing a suspect knew what they were doing was over the line , Chittum says . It can also act as a deterrent for illegal gun sellers , when prosecutors can \u2019 t take every case .\n\u201c The fact that he kept doing it after getting a letter from ATF was kind of a head scratcher \u201d\nLytton says that warning letters are a commonly used tactic across regulatory bodies , and are a low-cost tool to enforce federal standards , which can be especially useful if the agency doesn \u2019 t have the resources to mount a full investigation . But they have an obvious drawback : the addressee may choose to ignore them .\nAround 2014 , in one case in Minnesota , a man named Eitan Feldman began buying and reselling guns , often purchasing them from a registered dealer and then flipping them on Armslist , according to prosecutors . Guns he \u2019 d sold started turning up at crime scenes : police said they linked shots fired at a Minneapolis home to a pistol Feldman had bought a week earlier , and during a marijuana trafficking investigation , recovered a revolver Feldman had bought three months before . The ATF executed a search warrant on his house , finding shotguns that Feldman had legally purchased and then posted for sale on Armslist , sometimes within days of buying them .\nIn 2015 , ATF agents personally handed Feldman a written warning saying he appeared to be a \u201c dealer in firearms \u201d under the law and informed him that he could face criminal prosecution if he continued . Still , he kept selling guns , flipping six semi-automatic pistols and a semi-automatic rifle over the next few months , according to court records . \u201c The fact that he kept doing it after getting a letter from ATF was kind of a head scratcher , \u201d says Assistant US Attorney for the District of Minnesota Benjamin Bejar , who prosecuted the case .\nFeldman was eventually charged with illegally selling firearms . \u201c Most defendants whom I sentence have not had the courtesy of having the federal government hand them a written warning and give them a chance to stop , \u201d the judge said during the hearing . He was sentenced to 18 months \u2019 imprisonment in 2016 .\nBut whether illegal sellers are warned or not , the consequences can be devastating .\nChristopher Henderson and John Phillips , according to court records , made a business out of buying guns in the South , where gun restrictions are loose , and then reselling them up north . The two would buy from sellers on Armslist in Kentucky , rolling through the state in a white Dodge Challenger , then drive them back to Chicago . A broker working with Henderson and Phillips would then resell the weapons , often on Facebook . Soon after , the guns would turn up at crime scenes .\nIn 2017 , about nine miles away from where Commander Paul Bauer was killed , a 15-year-old boy named Xavier Soto was murdered . Prosecutors later linked the gun used in the killing \u2014 a Taurus pistol \u2014 to a purchase Henderson made through Armslist .\nBoth of the men were sentenced for illegal sales . At Henderson \u2019 s sentencing , Soto \u2019 s sister gave an emotional account of her brother \u2019 s short life .\n\u201c Our lives will never be the same , \u201d she told the court through tears . \u201c These alleged individuals supplied a weapon that was used to murder a 15-year-old boy . \u201d\nWhen she dialed 911 after an assault in October 2012 , Zina Daniel Haughton said her husband , Radcliffe Haughton , had been violent for years . Police took her to a Holiday Inn for the night , her family later said in court papers , but he showed up at her work the next day with a knife and slashed the tires of her car .\nZina soon asked for a restraining order against Radcliffe . She explained to a Wisconsin court : he had an explosive temper , threatening to throw acid on her face . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to die , \u201d she said in a hearing . The judge granted the restraining order , which barred her husband from owning a gun .\nTwo days after her testimony , Radcliffe Haughton found and purchased a semi-automatic handgun on Armslist from a private seller who didn \u2019 t run a background check . Haughton made the buy from the front seat of the seller \u2019 s car , according to the family , in a McDonald \u2019 s parking lot . The next day , he entered the suburban Milwaukee salon where Zina worked and opened fire . He killed three people , including Zina , before turning the gun on himself .\nIn the aftermath , Armslist faced questions about its role . Had the company effectively facilitated a mass shooting ? Yasmeen Daniel , Zina \u2019 s daughter , was at the spa when her mother was killed , and filed suit against Armslist in 2015 , arguing that the shooting could \u2019 ve been stopped .\nBut the same law that shields major social media companies like Facebook from liability for terrorist content produced by their users also protects Armslist from being sued when bad actors use their platform . Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is widely seen as the law that made the modern internet possible , paving the way for web forums , social media , and much more .\n\u201d If you required a license for each tweet that gets posted , that would make Twitter impossible \u201d\nThe act protects website operators from being sued over what their users post . If someone writes a defamatory tweet , for example , the person being defamed can \u2019 t sue Twitter for letting it happen .\n\u201d If you required a license for each tweet that gets posted , that would make Twitter impossible , \u201d says Grimmelmann , the Cornell professor . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t make firearm sales impossible . \u201d\nArmslist relied on Section 230 for its defense in the Daniel case . The company \u2019 s lawyers argued that the website can \u2019 t be held liable for unlawful sales . \u201c Under this theory , Armslist could go in , look at an ad , and say , \u2018 Oh , it \u2019 s an ad from the same seller who illegally sold 10 guns in the case that was famous last year , and wow , it looks like this ad is illegal , \u2019 \u201d Grimmelmann says . \u2018 \u201c We don \u2019 t care . We \u2019 re not going to touch it . \u2019 \u201d\nThe lawsuit \u2019 s counter argument was straightforward : Armslist wasn \u2019 t just a bystander on the sidelines while sales happened , but a participant . The design of the site , the suit argued , allowed buyers to search specifically for sellers who wouldn \u2019 t do a background check , giving people who were barred from owning guns an easy way to buy one . The suit said the website relied on a business model that \u201c put guns in the hands of prohibited purchasers . \u201d\nThe Daniel family \u2019 s suit has faced mixed judgments from the courts . After one court dismissed the suit , an appeals court reversed the decision , allowing it to proceed . A second appeal , this time from Armslist , elevated the case to Wisconsin \u2019 s Supreme Court , which decided that Armslist was protected under the Communications Decency Act . Most recently , in November of last year , the Supreme Court of the US declined to hear the case , leaving in place the Wisconsin Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling .\nThe intersection of internet speech law and gun rights policy has scrambled some usual political divides . After the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision , the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank , said that changes to 230 would cause \u201c real and permanent \u201d damage to the Second Amendment . The nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation , which argues for civil rights online , filed a brief in the case in favor of Armslist , arguing that finding the website liable would \u201c severely curtail free expression online . \u201d\nThe brief put the nonprofit at odds with groups like the nonprofit Cyber Civil Rights Initiative , which argues that the law was meant to protect good Samaritans , not to give cover to anyone who runs a website with third-party activity regardless of the consequences .\n\u201c The fact that Armslist is still in business after all the lawsuits it \u2019 s faced is pretty remarkable \u201d\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed , noting in its decision that Armslist couldn \u2019 t be held responsible even if it knew its site would be used to break the law . So long as a website can be used for legal purposes , it didn \u2019 t matter that it was used for illegal activity , too .\nSeen from one angle , the battle over Armslist looks like a microcosm of the larger war over Silicon Valley power and accountability . Should Facebook , for example , face consequences for failing to fact-check political ads ? Both Republicans and Democrats have taken aim at Section 230 recently , worried about the broad legal shield it gives the tech industry .\nEric Goldman , a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law who has written about the benefits of 230 , said the court that ruled against Armslist \u201c just kind of went off the rails , \u201d and he argues that chipping away at protections in the law will lead to legal problems for smaller sites .\n\u201d The key point of Section 230 was that Congress wanted sites to have the freedom to try and police against bad content , and not fear that they would be liable for anything they miss , \u201d Goldman says . \u201c If they \u2019 re held to a 100 percent standard , then they wouldn \u2019 t do it at all . \u201d\nSome people might want to see Armslist go , he says , but other sites will also lose legal protections without 230 . \u201c The fact that Armslist is still in business after all the lawsuits it \u2019 s faced is pretty remarkable , \u201d he says . \u201c Without Section 230 they would \u2019 ve been gone a long time ago . \u201d\nThe power of the law isn \u2019 t limitless , however . Federal prosecutors could shut down the website and indict its owners under criminal charges if they believed the law was broken .\n\u201d One of the standard tropes in the field is that Section 230 creates a lawless zone , \u201d Goldman says . \u201c Anyone who says that is factually wrong . Section 230 does not restrict federal criminal prosecutions . \u201d\nBut Mary Anne Franks , president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative , says the law has effectively given a special legal shield to online activity that wouldn \u2019 t be protected in physical space . \u201c If it wouldn \u2019 t be speech if it was offline , it shouldn \u2019 t be speech if it \u2019 s online , \u201d she argues .\n\u201d Punching somebody in the face is not speech , even though it might be very expressive , \u201d she says . \u201c What Section 230 has done is seduce courts into not making that kind of analysis . Instead , they assume that if it \u2019 s happening online then it \u2019 s speech , and then they go to the next step . \u201d\nFranks questions whether the stakes have truly hit home for defenders of a broad interpretation of the statute . \u201c We have a case in Armslist which is really a question of life or death , and they don \u2019 t seem to think that that \u2019 s relevant , \u201d she says .\nAfter pleading guilty for illegally selling guns on Armslist , Thomas Caldwell had his sentencing hearing in November 2018 . While he faced charges for illegal gun sales , the killing of Commander Paul Bauer loomed over the proceedings . Caldwell \u2019 s defense team pleaded for probation , saying Caldwell had been through enough : his \u201c digital legacy will connect him forever \u201d with the murdered officer , his attorneys wrote to the court .\nThe prosecution disagreed , and pushed for prison time . A prosecutor told the judge that Caldwell had disregarded a warning from the ATF . They needed to make clear that was unacceptable . \u201c Next time an ATF agent delivers one of those warning letters , I want them also to be able to be in the position to deliver a story . \u2018 Look what happened to Thomas Caldwell , \u2019 \u201d the prosecutor said . To add emotion to their argument , the prosecution called for the testimony of someone who knew Bauer well : Northeastern Illinois University Police Chief John Escalante .\nEscalante grew up with Bauer from the age of seven . The two went to the same grade school , the same college , and then joined the Chicago Police Department together . Escalante always thought Bauer was the responsible one . In college , Bauer was the serious student , Escalante said , while he was \u201c a little bit more of a partier \u201d and was \u201c politely asked \u201d not to return after two years . But as luck would have it , in 1986 , they entered the police department within one month of each other . \u201c We spent the next 30 years chasing each other around the streets of Chicago as Chicago police officers , \u201d he said .\nEscalante remembered getting the call from an officer he knew on the force . He told Escalante that he should sit down , and delivered the news that Bauer had been shot .\nWhen Escalante learned that the gun had made its way from Wisconsin to Chicago through Armslist , he wasn \u2019 t surprised . Escalante rose through the ranks of the Chicago Police Department and was , for a time , its interim superintendent . He \u2019 d seen the toll of illegal gun sales on the city . \u201c It \u2019 s happened too many times and now it happened to my good friend Paul and it shouldn \u2019 t have , \u201d he said .\nAt Caldwell \u2019 s sentencing , Escalante said he was looking back at \u201c every text , every email \u201d with Bauer for moments that made him laugh . He didn \u2019 t mention Armslist , but focused on \u201c accountability , \u201d and \u201c those that put the guns into the hands of those that commit the violence . \u201d\nEscalante said that he \u2019 d struggled to say Bauer had died . \u201c You die of old age , you die of sickness , you die from accidents , but when someone fires multiple rounds into your body , that \u2019 s not dying , \u201d he told the court , \u201c that \u2019 s a murder . \u201d\nThis story was published in partnership with The Trace , a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence .\nUpdate , 2:30PM ET , January 17th : In a statement sent following publication , an attorney for Armslist said \u201c courts have consistently ruled that Armslist.com falls squarely within the \u2018 safe harbor \u2019 of Section 230 \u201d and that the company both \u201c fully complies \u201d with all laws and regularly assists law enforcement . \u201c The gist of the opposition to Armslist lies in opposition to the private ownership of firearms , \u201d the statement said .",
    "content_original": "Thomas Caldwell was a veteran in his 60s with a soft physique, oval glasses, no income, and a history of mental illness. \u201cI\u2019ve been schizophrenic all my life, hearing voices,\u201d he once said in a courtroom. He didn\u2019t have a license to sell firearms, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him. In 2015, according to prosecutors, police found a Glock in a Milwaukee drug house and quickly linked it to him. He\u2019d purchased it only the day before.\n\nMonths later, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) confronted Caldwell about the pistol. According to the ATF, he said he had been purchasing guns from a licensed dealer, then reselling many of them through Armslist.com, a website that connects sellers with buyers looking for anything from a pistol to an AR-15.\n\nIf Caldwell wanted to sell guns, the ATF warned him, there was a proper way to do it. Without obtaining a federal firearms license, he was breaking the law and potentially putting weapons into the hands of criminals.\n\nCaldwell didn\u2019t listen, and he managed to turn flipping guns into a substantial business, prosecutors later said. Between December 2015 and May 2018, he made cash deposits into his bank account totaling more than $19,000, all from gun sales. Even after his initial run-in with authorities, he kept up the practice for years. In 2017, Madison police found a Taurus 9mm pistol during an investigation, then traced it back to a purchase Caldwell had made two weeks before.\n\nEventually, the ATF found that 11 guns recovered by police during investigations had been purchased by Caldwell. Since the ATF\u2019s 2015 warning, he\u2019d bought 95 handguns and 11 rifles from 57 different sellers. Caldwell posted more than 200 listings for guns on the website, according to prosecutors, sometimes explicitly noting the weapons were brand-new and unfired.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, he had said that a license was \u201ctoo much paperwork\u201d\n\nOfficials believed the short \u201ctime to crime\u201d \u2014 the gap between a sale and when it\u2019s recovered at a crime scene \u2014 meant Caldwell had become a known source for criminals. A prosecutor would later say a tragedy was \u201cinevitable.\u201d As the Chicago Tribune noted last year, authorities declined to say why he wasn\u2019t charged much earlier.\n\nTwo years after he first came to the attention of the ATF, agents organized an undercover sting, buying a Walther .40-caliber pistol from Caldwell on Armslist. But while Caldwell was still under investigation, he sold a weapon on Armslist and, months later, the gun somehow arrived in Chicago. When it did, Police Commander Paul Bauer responded to a call in the Loop and caught up with a suspect. In the struggle that followed, Bauer was shot six times and killed with the gun.\n\nCaldwell, according to the ATF, described selling guns as an addiction. Police executed a search warrant on his home and uncovered 44 firearms as they kept building their case. Owning a lot of guns is not in itself a crime, and undeterred, Caldwell sold another gun to an undercover investigator on Armslist a month later.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to illegally selling guns in 2018, nearly three years after first being warned by the ATF. According to prosecutors, he had said that a license was \u201ctoo much paperwork.\u201d\n\nCaldwell isn\u2019t the only frequent user of Armslist. Over the years, the website has become a major destination for firearm buyers and sellers. The site can be used legally, and its terms of use explicitly direct users to follow applicable firearms laws. Critics, however, say the site\u2019s operators have taken a hands-off approach to moderating the content on their platform that fuels violence and allows private sellers to bypass getting a federal firearms license.\n\nLaw enforcement faces legal barriers to policing rogue sellers like Caldwell, but the law has also put Armslist itself out of reach. The same legal protections meant to help the internet flourish have also ensured the guns keep flowing.\n\n\u201cTo protect the good actors, you have to write a standard that allows people to be pretty terrible actors too,\u201d says James Grimmelmann, professor of law at Cornell University. \u201cThe challenge is how do you distinguish the good from the terrible actors.\u201d\n\nUnder federal law, it\u2019s legal for people to sell guns without a background check. It\u2019s only when they become \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns that they are required by law to obtain a license from the ATF and run checks on every sale.\n\nSo when does selling guns turn from a hobby into a full-fledged business enterprise? It\u2019s difficult to tell. One person might, for example, inherit dozens of antiques and sell them without issue. But another person might buy a handful of guns from a registered seller, flip them in private sales without conducting background checks, and be deemed engaged in the business.\n\nExecutive actions made during the second term of the Obama presidency were supposed to tighten the definition of \u201cengaging in the business.\u201d They state that those \u201cwho utilize the Internet or other technologies must obtain a license, just as a dealer whose business is run out of a traditional brick-and-mortar store.\u201d At the time, critics argued that the actions were \u201clegally meaningless\u201d and that they amounted to little more than \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president and Congress often charge administrative agencies with very broad and ambitious tasks, and they rarely provide sufficient funding to actually carry them out,\u201d said Timothy Lytton, a distinguished professor of law at Georgia State University who specializes in safety regulation and gun violence.\n\nThe ambiguity of federal law \u2014 and the fact it is rarely enforced \u2014 leaves it open to exploitation. And Armslist is home to many sellers whose activity falls in a gray area.\n\nThe Verge and The Trace scraped more than 2 million Armslist listings from December 2016 through March 2019 to identify users who may be skirting the law through high-volume sales.\n\n\u201cIf someone calls you up and says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019d like to buy a gun,\u2019 you should be able to check if the person can have a gun\u201d\n\nWe searched the text of listings for phone numbers and isolated the numbers that appeared most frequently. Armslist encourages users to communicate through direct messages on the website, but some sellers may include direct contact information in their posts.\n\nWe identified more than 700 phone numbers that appeared in 10 or more listings. The most used phone number belonged to a seller in South Carolina who was associated with more than 300 listings on Armslist during the period of time covered by our scraping. (The user denied posting ads on the site, but confirmed their phone number, which was included as contact information on each ad.) Thirty-eight other phone numbers appeared in 50 or more posts on the site.\n\nTo determine if sellers were licensed to conduct sales, we compared the contact information in the ads against the publicly available list of federal firearms licenses, which contains registered sellers\u2019 names, addresses, and phone numbers. Only 14 of the phone numbers attached to a high volume of ads appeared in the ATF\u2019s database.\n\nThe Trace and The Verge called every phone number linked to 25 or more listings \u2014 nearly 150 in total. We spoke to 10 sellers altogether. None of those sellers said they had a license to deal firearms. Two acknowledged that they used Armslist to turn a profit on sales, while the rest reported using the site primarily to offload firearms in their private collections. \u201cObviously if you get something and you know can get more for it, you\u2019re probably just going to turn around and sell it again,\u201d one user said.\n\nAll of the users we spoke with said they vetted prospective buyers in some way, whether by reading through the person\u2019s online presence or simply getting a sense of the person while negotiating a sale. But only a handful said they took customers to a licensed firearms dealer to perform a background check before making a sale.\n\nOne user from Florida, whose phone number was connected to nearly 50 listings, said he didn\u2019t conduct background checks on sales. But he wished that there was an easy way to review the history of a potential buyer. The user said that some people reaching out through Armslist didn\u2019t pass a gut check for a firearm transfer.\n\n\u201cIf someone calls you up and says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019d like to buy a gun,\u2019 you should be able to check if the person can have a gun,\u201d the Florida user said. \u201cI want to be a responsible gun owner.\u201d\n\nThe number of posts from a user doesn\u2019t necessarily match the number of gun sales, and the tool couldn\u2019t account for duplicate posts. However, for every user we spoke with, we confirmed that their phone numbers appeared in multiple non-duplicate posts on the site.\n\nWe described our findings to law enforcement officials to get a sense of whether this constituted evidence of sellers being \u201cengaged in the business.\u201d\n\nA man was convicted of engaging in the business of selling guns without a license, while serving as an FBI agent\n\nIn a statement, an ATF spokesperson said the agency looks at each case to see \u201cwhether there is sufficient evidence of willful misconduct\u201d to prove a violation. \u201cThe volume of sales is only one factor in evaluating whether someone is unlawfully engaged in the business, particularly since federal law expressly allows individuals to sell their personal firearms collections without a license,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cNumerous additional factors, such as the intent of the seller, must be considered.\u201d\n\nTo build a case, prosecutors must demonstrate that a person was willfully taking illegal action \u2014 that a seller knew what they were doing was wrong and flouted the law anyway.\n\n\u201cPeople who break this law should be prosecuted,\u201d says Thomas Chittum, assistant director of field operations at the ATF. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenging law to prosecute because of the willfulness requirement and because it\u2019s very fact-intensive, and sometimes those facts aren\u2019t readily available.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have relied on the volume of online listings as evidence in past cases. In 2010, a man was convicted of engaging in the business of selling guns without a license, while serving as an FBI agent. He had posted nearly 300 online gun ads over more than three years and collected more than $118,000 in firearm sales.\n\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Minnesota Erica MacDonald stifled laughter when asked whether prosecutors might want to scrutinize a seller who had posted hundreds of listings. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said.\n\nGuns are sold online in many ways. Retailers like Bass Pro Shops, Brownells, or BudsGunShop.com sell their firearms through company websites, but buyers pick up the guns from licensed dealers. There are also online marketplaces, like GunBroker and GunsAmerica, where the websites directly participate in the transaction in some way and allow for firearm transfers to flow through federal license holders. Then there are places like Armslist that function as an online classified section tailored to guns, and all transactions are done peer to peer.\n\nThe idea for Armslist formed in the summer of 2007, when Jonathan Gibbon was a student at the US Air Force Academy, he told the website Human Events. He saw that Craigslist had banned gun listings and thought he could step in to fill the void. So he connected with his classmate Brian Mancini at a Fourth of July party and they put together a basic version of the site.\n\nSomeone looking to offload a gun can put up a listing on Armslist in minutes and then simply wait for prospective buyers to reach out. With a few clicks, sellers can say where they\u2019re selling their gun, the make and build, how much it costs, and include an email address for queries. The process is as easy as buying a chair on Craigslist. Many of the users we spoke with said the site\u2019s simplicity is a big part of its draw.\n\nWhen a buyer visits a listing, they can learn nearly everything they\u2019d want to know about their new firearm. Up top, there are pictures of the gun from multiple angles, along with the manufacturer and caliber size. They just need to click on the \u201ccontact seller\u201d button to move forward and complete the sale. In some cases, sellers will include a personal cell number.\n\n\u201cIt connects firearm owners and enthusiasts, helping people to find deals on firearms and gear in their local area,\u201d Gibbon told Human Events in 2010. \u201cImagine a gun show that never ends, but you need an internet connection.\u201d\n\nLooking for a pistol? Machine gun and silencer? Rocket launcher? Armslist users are willing to sell you one.\n\nSince its founding, Armslist has gone on to become one of the most popular gun advertising websites. The site offers nearly any kind of gun you could imagine. Looking for a pistol? Machine gun and silencer? Rocket launcher? Armslist users are willing to sell you one.\n\nOnce you find what you\u2019re looking for, just contact the seller and arrange a meetup to finish the transaction. The transfer can take place in a gun store, home, or parking lot. There are no rules on where the handover needs to happen, as long as the timing works for both parties. The process is flexible enough for even the busiest online gun buyer.\n\nThe business has also become notorious for giving firearm access to people prohibited from owning guns. In a paper published in 2019, researchers with the University of Minnesota scraped more than 4.9 million Armslist listings from the website and found that less than 10 percent mentioned a background check.\n\nIn 2011, Demetry Smirnov, a Russian immigrant living in Canda, illegally purchased a handgun on Armslist and later used it to murder a woman who spurned his romantic advances. Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized US citizen who became a radicalized jihadist, used weapons acquired through Armslist to kill five US service members in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2015. In 2018, a woman who used Armslist to traffic guns was sentenced to 18 months in prison, but before her sentencing, one of her former firearms was used to shoot a police officer in Boston. And last year, federal prosecutors brought a case against an Alabama resident who admitted to trafficking guns acquired through Armslist to New York, California, and Mexico, after he watched a documentary film on gun trafficking in 2016.\n\nGun selling that bypasses the background check system through private transactions is commonly called the gun show loophole \u2014 in this case, the gun show just happens to be online. There are only a couple of restrictions: if the seller believes that the gun might be going to a person who is prohibited from owning a firearm or is from outside of their state, they cannot legally make the sale.\n\nThere are no laws that explicitly target the sale of firearms over the internet, and all online sales are supposed to be held to the same legal standards as sales that occur at physical locations. Machine guns, silencers, and other firearms and accessories regulated under the National Firearms Act require fingerprinting and registration with the ATF. Licensed federal firearms dealers are required to perform background checks and maintain records of gun sales.\n\nAdvocates and the US government have been studying the sale of firearms and gun accessories through Armslist and other online websites for years, but little has changed in terms of how they operate. In February 2019, the advocacy group Everytown For Gun Safety contacted 150 sellers on Armslist to buy firearms undercover. More than 65 percent of these sellers indicated that they would not require a background check to complete the sale. (Everytown\u2019s charitable arm provides funding to The Trace.)\n\nWhen the ATF finds someone it believes to be illegally selling guns, the agency might, in lieu of immediate prosecution, send a warning letter demanding the person stop selling. A warning letter can lay the groundwork for a case showing a suspect knew what they were doing was over the line, Chittum says. It can also act as a deterrent for illegal gun sellers, when prosecutors can\u2019t take every case.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he kept doing it after getting a letter from ATF was kind of a head scratcher\u201d\n\nLytton says that warning letters are a commonly used tactic across regulatory bodies, and are a low-cost tool to enforce federal standards, which can be especially useful if the agency doesn\u2019t have the resources to mount a full investigation. But they have an obvious drawback: the addressee may choose to ignore them.\n\nAround 2014, in one case in Minnesota, a man named Eitan Feldman began buying and reselling guns, often purchasing them from a registered dealer and then flipping them on Armslist, according to prosecutors. Guns he\u2019d sold started turning up at crime scenes: police said they linked shots fired at a Minneapolis home to a pistol Feldman had bought a week earlier, and during a marijuana trafficking investigation, recovered a revolver Feldman had bought three months before. The ATF executed a search warrant on his house, finding shotguns that Feldman had legally purchased and then posted for sale on Armslist, sometimes within days of buying them.\n\nIn 2015, ATF agents personally handed Feldman a written warning saying he appeared to be a \u201cdealer in firearms\u201d under the law and informed him that he could face criminal prosecution if he continued. Still, he kept selling guns, flipping six semi-automatic pistols and a semi-automatic rifle over the next few months, according to court records. \u201cThe fact that he kept doing it after getting a letter from ATF was kind of a head scratcher,\u201d says Assistant US Attorney for the District of Minnesota Benjamin Bejar, who prosecuted the case.\n\nFeldman was eventually charged with illegally selling firearms. \u201cMost defendants whom I sentence have not had the courtesy of having the federal government hand them a written warning and give them a chance to stop,\u201d the judge said during the hearing. He was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment in 2016.\n\nBut whether illegal sellers are warned or not, the consequences can be devastating.\n\nChristopher Henderson and John Phillips, according to court records, made a business out of buying guns in the South, where gun restrictions are loose, and then reselling them up north. The two would buy from sellers on Armslist in Kentucky, rolling through the state in a white Dodge Challenger, then drive them back to Chicago. A broker working with Henderson and Phillips would then resell the weapons, often on Facebook. Soon after, the guns would turn up at crime scenes.\n\nIn 2017, about nine miles away from where Commander Paul Bauer was killed, a 15-year-old boy named Xavier Soto was murdered. Prosecutors later linked the gun used in the killing \u2014 a Taurus pistol \u2014 to a purchase Henderson made through Armslist.\n\nBoth of the men were sentenced for illegal sales. At Henderson\u2019s sentencing, Soto\u2019s sister gave an emotional account of her brother\u2019s short life.\n\n\u201cOur lives will never be the same,\u201d she told the court through tears. \u201cThese alleged individuals supplied a weapon that was used to murder a 15-year-old boy.\u201d\n\nWhen she dialed 911 after an assault in October 2012, Zina Daniel Haughton said her husband, Radcliffe Haughton, had been violent for years. Police took her to a Holiday Inn for the night, her family later said in court papers, but he showed up at her work the next day with a knife and slashed the tires of her car.\n\nZina soon asked for a restraining order against Radcliffe. She explained to a Wisconsin court: he had an explosive temper, threatening to throw acid on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d she said in a hearing. The judge granted the restraining order, which barred her husband from owning a gun.\n\nTwo days after her testimony, Radcliffe Haughton found and purchased a semi-automatic handgun on Armslist from a private seller who didn\u2019t run a background check. Haughton made the buy from the front seat of the seller\u2019s car, according to the family, in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot. The next day, he entered the suburban Milwaukee salon where Zina worked and opened fire. He killed three people, including Zina, before turning the gun on himself.\n\nIn the aftermath, Armslist faced questions about its role. Had the company effectively facilitated a mass shooting? Yasmeen Daniel, Zina\u2019s daughter, was at the spa when her mother was killed, and filed suit against Armslist in 2015, arguing that the shooting could\u2019ve been stopped.\n\nBut the same law that shields major social media companies like Facebook from liability for terrorist content produced by their users also protects Armslist from being sued when bad actors use their platform. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is widely seen as the law that made the modern internet possible, paving the way for web forums, social media, and much more.\n\n\u201dIf you required a license for each tweet that gets posted, that would make Twitter impossible\u201d\n\nThe act protects website operators from being sued over what their users post. If someone writes a defamatory tweet, for example, the person being defamed can\u2019t sue Twitter for letting it happen.\n\n\u201dIf you required a license for each tweet that gets posted, that would make Twitter impossible,\u201d says Grimmelmann, the Cornell professor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make firearm sales impossible.\u201d\n\nArmslist relied on Section 230 for its defense in the Daniel case. The company\u2019s lawyers argued that the website can\u2019t be held liable for unlawful sales. \u201cUnder this theory, Armslist could go in, look at an ad, and say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s an ad from the same seller who illegally sold 10 guns in the case that was famous last year, and wow, it looks like this ad is illegal,\u2019\u201d Grimmelmann says. \u2018\u201cWe don\u2019t care. We\u2019re not going to touch it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s counter argument was straightforward: Armslist wasn\u2019t just a bystander on the sidelines while sales happened, but a participant. The design of the site, the suit argued, allowed buyers to search specifically for sellers who wouldn\u2019t do a background check, giving people who were barred from owning guns an easy way to buy one. The suit said the website relied on a business model that \u201cput guns in the hands of prohibited purchasers.\u201d\n\nThe Daniel family\u2019s suit has faced mixed judgments from the courts. After one court dismissed the suit, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing it to proceed. A second appeal, this time from Armslist, elevated the case to Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, which decided that Armslist was protected under the Communications Decency Act. Most recently, in November of last year, the Supreme Court of the US declined to hear the case, leaving in place the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe intersection of internet speech law and gun rights policy has scrambled some usual political divides. After the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said that changes to 230 would cause \u201creal and permanent\u201d damage to the Second Amendment. The nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, which argues for civil rights online, filed a brief in the case in favor of Armslist, arguing that finding the website liable would \u201cseverely curtail free expression online.\u201d\n\nThe brief put the nonprofit at odds with groups like the nonprofit Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which argues that the law was meant to protect good Samaritans, not to give cover to anyone who runs a website with third-party activity regardless of the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Armslist is still in business after all the lawsuits it\u2019s faced is pretty remarkable\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed, noting in its decision that Armslist couldn\u2019t be held responsible even if it knew its site would be used to break the law. So long as a website can be used for legal purposes, it didn\u2019t matter that it was used for illegal activity, too.\n\nSeen from one angle, the battle over Armslist looks like a microcosm of the larger war over Silicon Valley power and accountability. Should Facebook, for example, face consequences for failing to fact-check political ads? Both Republicans and Democrats have taken aim at Section 230 recently, worried about the broad legal shield it gives the tech industry.\n\nEric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law who has written about the benefits of 230, said the court that ruled against Armslist \u201cjust kind of went off the rails,\u201d and he argues that chipping away at protections in the law will lead to legal problems for smaller sites.\n\n\u201dThe key point of Section 230 was that Congress wanted sites to have the freedom to try and police against bad content, and not fear that they would be liable for anything they miss,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cIf they\u2019re held to a 100 percent standard, then they wouldn\u2019t do it at all.\u201d\n\nSome people might want to see Armslist go, he says, but other sites will also lose legal protections without 230. \u201cThe fact that Armslist is still in business after all the lawsuits it\u2019s faced is pretty remarkable,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout Section 230 they would\u2019ve been gone a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThe power of the law isn\u2019t limitless, however. Federal prosecutors could shut down the website and indict its owners under criminal charges if they believed the law was broken.\n\n\u201dOne of the standard tropes in the field is that Section 230 creates a lawless zone,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cAnyone who says that is factually wrong. Section 230 does not restrict federal criminal prosecutions.\u201d\n\nBut Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, says the law has effectively given a special legal shield to online activity that wouldn\u2019t be protected in physical space. \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be speech if it was offline, it shouldn\u2019t be speech if it\u2019s online,\u201d she argues.\n\n\u201dPunching somebody in the face is not speech, even though it might be very expressive,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat Section 230 has done is seduce courts into not making that kind of analysis. Instead, they assume that if it\u2019s happening online then it\u2019s speech, and then they go to the next step.\u201d\n\nFranks questions whether the stakes have truly hit home for defenders of a broad interpretation of the statute. \u201cWe have a case in Armslist which is really a question of life or death, and they don\u2019t seem to think that that\u2019s relevant,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter pleading guilty for illegally selling guns on Armslist, Thomas Caldwell had his sentencing hearing in November 2018. While he faced charges for illegal gun sales, the killing of Commander Paul Bauer loomed over the proceedings. Caldwell\u2019s defense team pleaded for probation, saying Caldwell had been through enough: his \u201cdigital legacy will connect him forever\u201d with the murdered officer, his attorneys wrote to the court.\n\nThe prosecution disagreed, and pushed for prison time. A prosecutor told the judge that Caldwell had disregarded a warning from the ATF. They needed to make clear that was unacceptable. \u201cNext time an ATF agent delivers one of those warning letters, I want them also to be able to be in the position to deliver a story. \u2018Look what happened to Thomas Caldwell,\u2019\u201d the prosecutor said. To add emotion to their argument, the prosecution called for the testimony of someone who knew Bauer well: Northeastern Illinois University Police Chief John Escalante.\n\nEscalante grew up with Bauer from the age of seven. The two went to the same grade school, the same college, and then joined the Chicago Police Department together. Escalante always thought Bauer was the responsible one. In college, Bauer was the serious student, Escalante said, while he was \u201ca little bit more of a partier\u201d and was \u201cpolitely asked\u201d not to return after two years. But as luck would have it, in 1986, they entered the police department within one month of each other. \u201cWe spent the next 30 years chasing each other around the streets of Chicago as Chicago police officers,\u201d he said.\n\nEscalante remembered getting the call from an officer he knew on the force. He told Escalante that he should sit down, and delivered the news that Bauer had been shot.\n\nWhen Escalante learned that the gun had made its way from Wisconsin to Chicago through Armslist, he wasn\u2019t surprised. Escalante rose through the ranks of the Chicago Police Department and was, for a time, its interim superintendent. He\u2019d seen the toll of illegal gun sales on the city. \u201cIt\u2019s happened too many times and now it happened to my good friend Paul and it shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Caldwell\u2019s sentencing, Escalante said he was looking back at \u201cevery text, every email\u201d with Bauer for moments that made him laugh. He didn\u2019t mention Armslist, but focused on \u201caccountability,\u201d and \u201cthose that put the guns into the hands of those that commit the violence.\u201d\n\nEscalante said that he\u2019d struggled to say Bauer had died. \u201cYou die of old age, you die of sickness, you die from accidents, but when someone fires multiple rounds into your body, that\u2019s not dying,\u201d he told the court, \u201cthat\u2019s a murder.\u201d\n\nThis story was published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence.\n\nUpdate, 2:30PM ET, January 17th: In a statement sent following publication, an attorney for Armslist said \u201ccourts have consistently ruled that Armslist.com falls squarely within the \u2018safe harbor\u2019 of Section 230\u201d and that the company both \u201cfully complies\u201d with all laws and regularly assists law enforcement. \u201cThe gist of the opposition to Armslist lies in opposition to the private ownership of firearms,\u201d the statement said.",
