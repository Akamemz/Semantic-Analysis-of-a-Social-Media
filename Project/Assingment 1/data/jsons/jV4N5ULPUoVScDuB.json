    "content": "As previously noted on the Tipsheet in the past month , Democrats have been at each others throats after suffering devastating losses at every level of government during the 2014-midterm elections in November . Less than 24-hours after the polls closed on Election Night , when Republicans retook the Senate and the biggest majority of state legislatures in American history , outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid sent his chief-of-staff to the Washington Post to slam President Obama for the losses . Just days later , Howard Dean called Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber `` elitist '' and `` out-of-touch '' with the American people . Last week New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer admitted that the focus on healthcare reform during President Obama 's first two years in office was a mistake and not what the American people wanted .\n`` Democrats should have continued to propose middle class-oriented programs , and built on the partial success of the stimulus . But unfortunately , Democrats blew the opportunity that the American people gave them . We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem : Healthcare reform\u2026it was n't the change we were hired to make , '' Schumer said during a speech at the National Press Club .\nNow , Schumer is facing push back from Democrats on the Hill and in the White House trying desperately to keep Obamacare alive just one month before Republicans take their majority in the Senate .\nSen. Chuck Schumer \u2019 s ( D-New York ) comments on Wednesday about Democrats \u2019 misguided focus on health care in President Barack Obama \u2019 s first term prompted backlash from top Democrats and left-leaning groups , who accused him of being politically craven .\nIt was a characterization with which top Democrats took issue , all the way up to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-California ) , who was instrumental in getting the Affordable Care Act passed into law as the speaker of the House .
