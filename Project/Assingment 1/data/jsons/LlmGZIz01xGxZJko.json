    "content": "Tucker Carlson at the 2018 Student Action Summit ( Gage Skidmore )\nConservatives should heed Tucker Carlson \u2019 s advice . We shouldn \u2019 t assume that what is good for markets is good for all of us .\nTucker Carlson \u2019 s monologue heard round the world is interesting on its own terms . In it , he argues against a conservatism that consistently prizes commercial interests above those of everyone else . I encourage you to watch or read it in full . Yet the response on the right is as interesting as Carlson \u2019 s monologue itself , for it reveals a discomfort among some conservatives for balancing the tensions that exist in our coalition and in our ideology .\nThere is , by many on the right , an effort to sing the praises of market capitalism without acknowledging the tensions between our pro-market principles and everything else . I respect Ben Shapiro a great deal , but I found this paragraph in his response to Carlson curious :\nSupply and demand economics has powered most of the world \u2019 s human beings out of extreme poverty , and led to the richest society in human history . It has allowed us to live longer , in bigger houses , in more comfort . It has meant fewer dead children and more living parents . If we \u2019 ve blown that advantage , that \u2019 s our own fault . Traditional conservatives recognized that the role of economics is to provide prosperity \u2014 to raise the GDP . The role of a social fabric and a value system is to provide meaning .\nTo put a particularly fine point on it : Our economy has not produced fewer dead children and more living parents in America , at least not in the section of the country where I live . The opioid epidemic , in particular , has ravaged whole communities \u2014 driving down life expectancy , depriving children of their parents , and parents of their children . The human cost of this crisis is simply incomprehensible . In states such as Ohio , West Virginia , and Kentucky , countless children are growing up with parents in jail , incapacitated , or underground . Yes , they live in a country with a higher GDP than a generation ago , and they \u2019 re undoubtedly able to buy cheaper consumer goods , but to paraphrase Reagan : Are they better off than they were 20 years ago ? Many would say , unequivocally , \u201c no . \u201d\nSome economic libertarians might say that these problems are the consequence of bad individual choices , and I wouldn \u2019 t entirely disagree . I grew up in a family plagued by addiction , and I saw some bad choices . Yet bad choices simply aren \u2019 t enough to explain the crisis \u2014 people have always made bad choices , and the familial , neighborhood , and economic contexts in which they live can exacerbate or improve them . Others might admit that it \u2019 s not all bad choices , that bad policy plays a role , but oddly the bad policy they point to is almost always the negative incentives of the welfare state . Again , they have a point \u2014 our welfare state is far from perfect , especially when it comes to encouraging work and family formation \u2014 but there are many other policies at play here .\nTo keep the focus on the opioid epidemic , the Los Angeles Times \u2019 reporting on the role of the pharmaceutical industry is both excellent and disturbing . It chronicles the ways in which some companies gamed our regulatory system to obtain approval and patent protection for highly addictive drugs . Those companies then knowingly lied about the safety of those drugs to doctors and patients . Some commentators have framed their problem with Tucker \u2019 s argument as promoting \u201c government intervention \u201d when that same intervention is the problem . But if you want to protect a community from drugs that can take hold of a person \u2019 s mind and destroy whole neighborhoods soon thereafter , you need some government intervention .\nThis raises a fundamental question with which so many of Tucker \u2019 s critics refuse to even engage : What happens when the companies that drive the market economy \u2014 and all of its benefits \u2014 don \u2019 t care about the American nation \u2019 s social fabric ? What happens when , as in the case of a few massive narcotics sellers , they profit by destroying that fabric ?\nSurely our response can \u2019 t be : \u201c Well , the market will take care of it. \u201d The market is not a Platonic deity , floating in the sky and imposing goodness and prosperity from on high . It is the creation of our choices , our laws , and our democratic process . We know , for instance , that pornography has radically altered how young boys perceive their relationships with women and sex , and that the pornography industry has acquired a lot of wealth in the process of creating and distributing that content . Just last month , we learned that a Chinese entity created the first gene-edited baby , using a technology developed in the United States . Some company , here or there , will eventually create a lot of prosperity by using this gene-editing technology ( called CRISPR ) in an unethical way , quite literally playing God with the most sacred power in the universe \u2014 the creation of human life . In the past few years , it has become abundantly clear that Apple \u2014 despite self-righteously refusing to cooperate with American security officials \u2014 has willingly complied with the requirements of the Chinese surveillance state , even as China builds concentration camps for dissidents and religious minorities . And , as Carlson mentioned , there are marijuana companies pushing for legalization , though we know from the Colorado experience that legalization increases use , and from other studies that use is concentrated among the lower class , causing a host of social problems in the process .\nAll of these entities are doing what the market demands , and in some ways , it \u2019 s hard to blame them . But shouldn \u2019 t our laws and policy make life harder for them ? Or should conservatives cry \u201c small government \u201d every time someone suggests an intervention and stick our collective head in the sand , pretending there \u2019 s no relationship between market actors and the civil society we say we believe in ?\nOf course , the recognition that corporate interests might not always align with civil society \u2019 s interests comes from the patron saint of capitalism , Adam Smith . We simply must develop the intellectual ability to understand the way in which law and policy drive outcomes in our society besides creating bad incentives for poor people . Sometimes they create bad incentives for the rich . Sometimes they allow the incentives that already exist to run roughshod over our communities and families . The market , as Smith understood , is merely a tool \u2014 a powerful tool , yes . But if we care about the flourishing of our society , and if we value ends besides a larger GDP , then we have to do the difficult work of balancing the competing demands of our values . Instead , many of our intellectuals simply pretend there is no competition \u2014 that what is good for markets is good for the rest of our nation . This is a recipe for boring thinking and bad policy .\nThis is not to say that all the fault lies with the failure of government to act in some way or another .
