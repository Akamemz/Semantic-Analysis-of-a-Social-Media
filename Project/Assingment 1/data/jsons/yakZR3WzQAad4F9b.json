Rand Paul filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday to halt the NSA \u2019 s phone records collection program and invited millions of Americans to sign up as co-plaintiffs with him , calling the case a chance to re-establish constitutional boundaries on privacy .\nThe Kentucky Republican , a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , said he doesn \u2019 t see Congress moving quickly to crack down on the National Security Agency \u2019 s snooping and the changes President Obama announced last month don \u2019 t go far enough .
