    "content": "Republicans \u2013 particularly Donald Trump \u2013 are crowing about record turnouts in the first four nominating contests , while Democratic turnout has slumped compared with 2008 , the party \u2019 s last competitive primary season .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s outsize presence in the race is clearly a factor . The Donald himself was quick to brag about the disparate turnout trends in a tweet Sunday morning , after Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton crushed Bernie Sanders in the first Southern primary .\n\u201c While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins , Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles . GROWING PARTY , \u201d the billionaire showman wrote .\nBut don \u2019 t read too much into the GOP \u2019 s turnout numbers , even if they continue to break records in the 12 contests on March 1 , aka Super Tuesday , analysts say . For starters , strong Republican turnout now doesn \u2019 t guarantee victory over the Democratic nominee in the general election .\n\u201c Just because Democrats are coming down from their 2008 highs , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that come November their voters aren \u2019 t going to show up to vote , \u201d says Michael McDonald , a political scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville .\nAnd don \u2019 t give Trump all the credit for the GOP \u2019 s record-breaking turnout numbers ; another factor has been the size of the field .\n\u201c Turnout rates in presidential nomination contests are highly sensitive to the levels of competition , \u201d says Professor McDonald , an expert on election turnout .\nWhen the primaries began , the Republicans had 17 major candidates to the Democrats \u2019 three . Even now , there are still five Republican candidates in the race ( to the Democrats \u2019 two ) , and the competition remains fierce as Trump threatens on Tuesday to move a big step closer to locking down the nomination .\nIn the early states , in particular , high levels of advertising , campaign organization , and voter outreach from so many candidates engaged Republicans like never before since the advent of the modern nomination system . On top of that , the Trump phenomenon has captured attention in a big way , both through his massive rallies and wall-to-wall TV coverage .\nSome of the Trump-driven turnout is people motivated to vote against the controversial billionaire . How the anti-Trump Republican vote plays out in November , should he win the nomination , is a big question . Some conservative Republicans , including Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse , have pledged not to vote for Trump and say they will find a \u201c third option . \u201d\n\u201c Trump is a polarizing figure , even within the GOP , \u201d says McDonald . \u201c There are some people showing up to vote for him , and some showing up to vote against him . It \u2019 s not clear how much this enthusiasm will translate into the general [ election ] if Trump is the nominee . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton , the Democratic front-runner is polarizing , too , and many anti-Trump Republicans can be expected to hold their noses and vote for the billionaire as a vote against Clinton .\nBut for now , the early turnout numbers tell a story . In Iowa , Republicans drew 180,000 people to the caucuses , up from 121,000 in 2012 . In New Hampshire , GOP primary turnout was 284,000 , up from 248,000 . In South Carolina , the party drew 730,000 voters to its primary , versus 603,000 in 2012 . And in Nevada , 75,000 people turned out for the caucuses , up from 33,000 in 2012 .\nThe Democrats , in fact , beat the Republicans on caucus turnout in Nevada this year with 80,000 , but that figure was well below the 2008 Democratic turnout of 120,000 . A month ago in Iowa , Democrats drew 171,000 to the caucuses , compared with 240,000 in 2008 . In the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary , Democratic turnout was 251,000 , versus 289,000 in 2008 . And in South Carolina last Saturday , 367,000 Democrats voted , a 30 percent decline from 2008 .\nIn 2008 , the Democrats fielded a large number of candidates \u2013 Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , Joe Biden , and four others \u2013 but the race quickly winnowed down to then-Senator Obama and then-Senator Clinton . Interest was high from the start , and remained high , as both Obama and Clinton sought to make history .\nBut it \u2019 s not necessarily fair to compare the 2016 Democratic turnout numbers to those of 2008 , or suggest that because the Republicans are beating Democrats in turnout in the early contests , that bodes ill for the Democratic nominee \u2019 s chances in November .\n\u201c Go back to the 2000 elections , \u201d says McDonald . \u201c The Republicans had much higher turnout rates in the early contests than the Democrats did , with much greater differentials than we \u2019 re seeing now . By November , the general election was one of the closest in modern history , and the Democrat won the popular vote . \u201d\nAmy Walter , national editor at the Cook Political Report , also warns against conflating the Republican \u201c turnout surge \u201d with electability in the general election .\n\u201c Every action has an equal and opposite reaction , \u201d Ms. Walter writes . \u201c Getting more white and angry voters to the polls with nativist language also helps to turn out passive Democratic voters who might have stayed home but for the threat of Trump \u2019 s candidacy . \u201d\nDemocrats started the 2016 cycle laboring under a huge \u201c enthusiasm gap. \u201d In late December , a poll by CNN/ORC International found that 36 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents were \u201c extremely enthusiastic \u201d about voting for president in 2016 , while just 19 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents felt that way .\nBy the end of February , Democrats had closed that 17 point gap to 8 points .
