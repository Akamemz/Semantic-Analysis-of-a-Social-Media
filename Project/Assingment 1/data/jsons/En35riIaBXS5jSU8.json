    "content": "For months , Bernie Sanders and his supporters have pointed to polls that show him running comfortably ahead of Donald Trump in November . But now that Hillary Clinton \u2019 s lead over Trump has disappeared \u2014 and the two likely nominees are now running neck-and-neck in national polls \u2014 his argument is gaining new resonance .\nClinton and her campaign argue that the Vermont senator hasn \u2019 t undergone the kind of scrutiny that Clinton and Trump have \u2014 and that his poll numbers are over-inflated compared to candidates who have faced intense political attacks from the other party .\nThe data remain unequivocal , however : The latest averages from HuffPost Pollster give Clinton a just less-than-2-point advantage over Trump , while Sanders \u2014 who is virtually certain to finish well behind Clinton in pledged delegates \u2014 leads Trump by 10 points . Trump has narrowed Clinton \u2019 s lead by 5 points since the end of April , while he \u2019 s only chipped 2 points off Sanders \u2019 edge .\nMoreover , there \u2019 s evidence that Clinton will face challenges uniting Democrats the way Trump has brought Republicans together since eliminating his opponents . Sanders \u2019 backers appear increasingly hostile to Clinton , polls show \u2014 especially those voters who currently favor Sanders over Trump but say they would defect to the Republican if Clinton is the Democratic nominee .\nThe debate isn \u2019 t just academic . Part of Sanders \u2019 last-ditch argument to the unpledged superdelegates he \u2019 d need to win over to have any hope of winning the Democratic nomination is that they should consider which candidate would run best against Trump before making their choice .\n\u201c Virtually every poll taken in the last two months has me doing better against Trump than Hillary Clinton , \u201d Sanders said on CNN on Sunday .\nClinton and her campaign have dismissed that argument repeatedly over the past few months , maintaining that Sanders hasn \u2019 t been assailed as Clinton has . Clinton hasn \u2019 t gone negative on Sanders with paid media thus far \u2014 and with the former secretary of state poised to emerge as the pledged-delegate leader at the end of the voting next month , it \u2019 s unlikely Sanders will be the subject of attack ads over the next three weeks .\n\u201c I do n't think he \u2019 s had a single negative ad ever run against him , \u201d Clinton said Sunday on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c And that 's fine . But we know what we 're going into , and we understand what it 's going to take to win in the fall . \u201d\nThree polls conducted last week confirm Sanders \u2019 advantage in the general election : An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed Clinton leading Trump by 3 points , 46 percent to 43 percent .

A CBS News/New York Times poll was better for Clinton , showing her leading Trump by 6 points .

An ABC News/Washington Post poll out this weekend didn \u2019 t include Sanders in the general-election trial heats .

According to HuffPost Pollster , Sanders \u2019 average image rating stands at 50 percent favorable and 41 percent unfavorable . That \u2019 s far better than the historically poor ratings for Trump ( 39 percent favorable/57 percent unfavorable ) and Clinton ( 41 percent favorable/55 percent unfavorable ) .\nClinton has one distinct advantage over Sanders : More Democrats want her to be the party \u2019 s nominee \u2014 a finding reflected not just in election returns over the past five months , but also in more recent national polling .
