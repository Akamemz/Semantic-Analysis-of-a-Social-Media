But there is a good chance it will be stolen from him .\nAt least that \u2019 s the line the Republican nominee started pushing this week . At a rally in Columbus , Ohio on Monday , Trump told the crowd , \u201c I \u2019 m afraid the election is going to be rigged , I have to be honest. \u201d He repeated the charge to Sean Hannity , who at this point might as well be his official spokesman , and added that he hopes that \u201c Republicans are watching closely or it \u2019 s going to be taken away from us . \u201d\nTrump was joined by his unofficial advisor , Roger Stone , a man who has never met a conspiracy theory for which he could resist fanning the flames . The day before Trump claimed in front of national reporters that the election might be rigged , Stone was telling radio host and noted conspiracy nut Alex Jones the same thing .\nLeft unsaid was who would be doing this rigging to take the election away from Trump and his merry band of supporters . That is an unimportant detail for the fearful masses to which Trump appeals . What matters is that once again , shadowy forces are conspiring to hurt America by denying her the president the people really want , and Donald Trump will lead the charge to keep that from happening .\nThis is not a new line of attack for Trump , who made similar claims about \u201c rigged \u201d elections when the GOP primaries were not going his way . In making it , he lays the groundwork for pre-emptively explaining his loss in November . Since Trump wins at everything and his campaign is predicated on how much America will \u201c win \u201d when he \u2019 s in office , he can \u2019 t admit to the possibility of losing fair and square . Someone must have stolen it from him .\nThis thinking puts Trump square in the tradition of the supporters of past Republican presidential losers . He has just taken their paranoia about shady Democrats with their \u201c Chicago-style \u201d dirty tricks and support of the biased mainstream media and made it one of his official talking points .\nIn the past , such talk was too undignified for a presidential candidate . So it was left to campaign surrogates and random crackpots . In 2012 , for instance , there was Dean Chambers , a conservative activist who ran the website UnskewedPolls.com . Chambers became infamous during that campaign for claiming polls were weighted too heavily in favor of showing the electorate to lean more Democratic than it did . So he re-weighted them in a way he felt must have reflected the real electorate .\nChambers \u2019 s re-weighted polling numbers were actually much more modest than those of other conservatives , showing that Mitt Romney would pull out a narrow win in the Electoral College . When Obama instead crushed Romney , beating him 332-206 in electoral votes , Chambers had to admit he had been wrong . At least until he discovered he could blame his failure on voter fraud .\nChambers was not the only conservative who missed the boat in 2012 . Karl Rove infamously melted down live on Fox News the night of the election , when the network called it for Obama . But what was notable was that the Romney campaign itself had apparently bought into the idea that the polls were skewed in favor of Democrats . Which led to shock inside the campaign on Election Night , when the results were rolling in and it became clear Romney had not only lost , but lost big .\nDemocratic-leaning voters have also cried foul over \u201c stolen \u201d and \u201c rigged \u201d elections as well . But generally , those cries have stayed on the fringes of the party . The vast majority of Bernie Sandes supporters , for example , seem to have accepted the results of this year \u2019 s primary despite some loud voices complaining the nomination was stolen from the Vermont senator by the rigging of the Democratic establishment . And in 2004 there were calls for contesting the general election results in Ohio over evidence of tampering with electronic voting machines that were alleged to have thrown the results in that crucial swing state to George W. Bush . But those calls never got any traction at the high levels of John Kerry \u2019 s campaign .\nCompare that with the infamous election of 2000 , when Republicans ran a disinformation campaign to convince the public that Democratic officials in Florida had their thumbs on the scale for Al Gore during a recount in Miami-Dade County . That allowed GOP operatives to pull off what became known as the Brooks Brothers riot , when khaki-clad Republicans stormed a meeting of election canvassers who were trying to perform a ballot recount . Eventually the recount was shut down .\nIronically , one of the leaders of the Brooks Brothers riot ? Current Trump hatchet man Roger Stone .\nSo Donald Trump is not doing anything new or unusual in trying to pre-emptively question his loss in the election and , by extension , sullying the legitimacy of a Clinton win .

The right-wing media will also happily stoke these fires .\nWhat is new is the candidate himself being willing to indulge in claims of stolen elections almost three months before voting starts .
