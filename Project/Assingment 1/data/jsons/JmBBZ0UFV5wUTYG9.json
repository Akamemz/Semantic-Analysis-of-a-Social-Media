In order to table the articles , lawmakers would need 51 votes , a majority that counts on nearly every Republican voting in favor of this action . Trump himself has also said that he \u2019 d like the opportunity to present arguments in his own defense : \u201c Frankly , I \u2019 d like a trial , \u201d he noted recently during a Fox & Friends appearance .\nWe don \u2019 t yet know exactly how long the trial is going to be , but it \u2019 s intended to provide the opportunity for both House lawmakers and Trump to make their cases .
