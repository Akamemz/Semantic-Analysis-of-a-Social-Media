    "content": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions , who himself seems stoned much of the time , just announced that his Department of Justice is going to start enforcing the federal laws against pot again despite a bunch of states doing a bong hit version of bombarding Ft. Sumpter . Look , no one is more annoyed than I am that Sessions decided to megapunt on his duties with regard to Democrat corruption and the Trump/Russia/Idiocy pseudo-scandal , but he doesn \u2019 t deserve all the grief he \u2019 s now getting from agitated hopheads and fussy libertarians \u2013 to the extent there \u2019 s a difference .\nSessions is right not to allow a cheesy end-run around a clear set of laws just because reforming those laws is going to be hard . And no , it \u2019 s not \u201c prosecutorial discretion \u201d to refuse to enforce the law . What the legalize-it crowd wants is no prosecution , which is the opposite of exercising discretion . The fact is that Sessions swore to enforce federal law . Pot is against federal law . It \u2019 s against federal law because our representatives in the House and Senate passed the laws and the president signed them . The people spoke . Remember that \u201c I \u2019 m Just a Bill \u201d Scholastic Rock cartoon ?\nYeah , man , that cartoon bill looks like a big fattie joint . Heh heh . Dude , where are the Doritos ?\nSee , if the people of this country pass a law thorough their elected representatives , it \u2019 s kind of central to the whole point of having a republic that the executive enforce those laws . You don \u2019 t cut corners by demanding that the executive branch just not enforce unpopular statutes . If you don \u2019 t like a law , here \u2019 s how you change it . You go pass another law that changes that law .\nLook , there \u2019 s a real problem here . Barack Obama \u2019 s DoJ didn \u2019 t help by kicking the dime bag down the road , and as a result lots of people are caught in this state-legal , federal-illegal twilight zone . These include casual stoners and investors in what one entrepreneur I spoke to insisted on referring to as \u201c the cannabis space . \u201d\nNow , because people decided to try and game the system , we have confusion . Many states are asserting what I and many other folks think is their prerogative to make terrible decisions involving their own territory . Colorado is now pretty much Jamaica in the Rockies . My own state of California just legalized pot , as if we needed more lazy and boring people here .\nStates \u2019 rights is an important concept \u2013 it \u2019 s sure nice to see some Democrats joining in on supporting it now for the first time since they last asserted states \u2019 rights to enforce Jim Crow \u2013 but see , the federal government gets to control interstate commerce . Thanks to the liberals , the concept of \u201c interstate commerce \u201d is pretty much interchangeable with \u201c any commerce. \u201d Leaving aside the interstate movement of pot , the feds have a right , under the current understanding of the regulation of interstate commerce , to outlaw dope everywhere . But hey , if the vocal corps of hemp enthusiasts out there wants to advocate for the Supreme Court to overrule the expansive reading of the commerce clause in Wickard v. Filburn , I \u2019 ll totally inhale .\nWhat \u2019 s a commerce clause , dude ? Is it like , related to Santa ?\nThe idea of changing the law by means of simply not enforcing it is worse than lazy \u2013 it \u2019 s undemocratic . There are a lot of people out there who think pot should stay illegal . No , they \u2019 re not hip or edgy , but they are American citizens and they have a right to be heard too . And they were heard \u2013 marijuana is against federal law . This idea disenfranchises them . I guess we tell them , \u201c Well , we all decided that the law you support is uncool so we decided to repeal it without giving you a say . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not a democracy ; that \u2019 s a dictatorship . Of course , good luck rousing the dazed and confused stormtroopers of the dictatorship of the pot-letariat from their moms \u2019 couches and getting them to put down their bongs long enough to pick up their bayonets .\nThe fact is that expecting Jeff Sessions to somehow provide us with an easy way around the Constitution by simply refusing to enforce a legitimately-passed law because some of usz don \u2019 t like it is obnoxious , and it \u2019 s a dangerous precedent . Actually , it \u2019 s not even a precedent . Barack Obama tried to do that with the so-called Dreamers , illegal aliens who ought to be dreaming of going back home . One of the many reasons WHY YOU GOT TRUMP was the sight of our Commander-in-Choom deciding , \u201c Nah , I don \u2019 t like the law you got passed , so too bad. \u201d Trump rightly refused to continue the charade , and threw the problem over to Congress , where it belongs .\nOf course , Congress doesn \u2019 t want to deal with DACA , or dope , because these are controversial issues and it \u2019 s easier and safer to palm them off on Jeff Sessions , who doesn \u2019 t appear to be particularly busy anyway . But that \u2019 s a cop-out , and even people who think we ought to let dope smokin \u2019 morons stumble about free and unhassled by the Man should demand that reform happen the right way \u2013 by a change in the law enacted through our democratic processes .\nLook , I despise pot .
