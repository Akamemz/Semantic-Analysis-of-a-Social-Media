    "content": "Remember when Donald Trump wanted a total and complete shutdown of Muslim immigration into the United States . Well , of course , the social justice warriors at Facebook too deep , deep offense to that , setting of an internal debate whether to ban the presidential nominee \u2019 s posts from the social media network over violations of its terms of service ( i.e . hate speech ) . The site \u2019 s director , Peter Thiel , pledging $ 1.25 million effort to elect the billionaire president , exacerbated the tension on this matter between Trump and Facebook , according to The Wall Street Journal . The platform recently said \u201c In the weeks ahead , we \u2019 re going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy , significant , or important to the public interest\u2014even if they might otherwise violate our standards. \u201d Yet , all of this talk about content , free speech , censorship , and Trump began with those December 2015 remarks about banning Muslims , which was a reaction to the horrific terrorist attack in San Bernardino :\nIssues around Mr. Trump \u2019 s posts emerged when he posted on Facebook a link to a Dec. 7 campaign statement \u201c on preventing Muslim immigration. \u201d The statement called for \u201c a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country \u2019 s representatives can figure out what is going on. \u201d Mr. Trump has since backed away from an outright ban based on religion , saying his policies would target immigrants from countries with a record of terrorism . Users flagged the December content as hate speech , a move that triggered a review by Facebook \u2019 s community-operations team , with hundreds of employees in several offices world-wide . Some Facebook employees said in internal chat rooms that the post broke Facebook \u2019 s rules on hate speech as detailed in its internal guidelines , according to people familiar with the matter . Content reviewers were asked by their managers not to remove the post , according to some of the people familiar . Facebook \u2019 s head of global policy management , Monika Bickert , later explained in an internal post that the company wouldn \u2019 t take down any of Mr. Trump \u2019 s posts because it strives to be impartial in the election season , according to people who saw the post . During one of Mr. Zuckerberg \u2019 s weekly town hall meetings in late January at the company \u2019 s Menlo Park , Calif. , headquarters , a Muslim employee asked how the executive could condone Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments . Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Mr. Trump \u2019 s call for a ban did qualify as hate speech , but said the implications of removing them were too drastic , according to two people who attended the meeting . Mr. Zuckerberg said he backed Ms. Bickert \u2019 s call , they said . Many employees supported the decision . \u201c Banning a U.S. presidential candidate is not something you do lightly , \u201d said one person familiar with the decision . But others , including some Muslim employees at Facebook , were upset that the platform would make an exception . In Dublin , where many of Facebook \u2019 s content reviewers work , more than a dozen Muslim employees met with their managers to discuss the policy , according to another person familiar with the matter . Some created internal Facebook groups protesting the decision , while others threatened to leave .\nIn the end , these folks lost\u2014and the decision by Zuckerberg was final . Facebook doesn \u2019 t get good marks from conservatives , given that Zuckerberg has voiced his support for some of Obama \u2019 s controversial policies , like rewriting federal immigration laws via executive order , and he \u2019 s from Silicon Valley ; a techno-centric mecca that \u2019 s chock full of progressive lefties . Yet , you have to give credit where credit is due : he held firm against what was probably an intense internal debate over whether to ban a presidential candidate from posting material . On the other hand , the site is expected to reap $ 300 million from online political advertising this cycle , so that might have something to do with it as well . Nevertheless , whether it was the aspect of losing revenue , allowing the site to share both liberal and conservative views from either candidates , or a mixture of the two , I guess we can say that Zuckerberg made the right call . After all , hate speech criteria is usually social justice warrior drivel , in which any speech that offends them is considered something akin to a Nazi rally . The Journal did note , as did many publications at the time , that Trump would only restrict immigration from countries with ties to terrorism , which isn \u2019 t controversial .

It takes pride in being a platform where news is shared , money can be raised , and people can connect .

It was a huge issue , which the Republicans took seriously while the Democrats mocked them ; a sign that this party shouldn \u2019 t be taken seriously on national security . Is a Muslim ban outrageous ? Yes . It is hate speech ? Hardly .
