    "content": "Still no ruling on health care , but the Supreme Court did hand down two important decisions this morning . The justices struck down most of Arizona \u2019 s immigration law , with the backing of Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. , and prohibited mandatory life terms without parole for juvenile offenders .\nStarting with the parole case : The ruling said that such mandatory sentencing schemes violate the 8th Amendment because they do not allow for consideration of \u201c an offender \u2019 s age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it. \u201d Those , it said , include \u201c immaturity , impetuosity , and failure to appreciate risks and consequences , \u201d as well as the juvenile \u2019 s \u201c family and home environment. \u201d It is unconstitutional to prohibit a court from considering the individual circumstances of a case .\nThis logic seems unassailable to me\u2014but it was a five-four decision . Justice Samuel Alito was so incensed that he read his dissent from the bench .\nThe Arizona ruling was more muddied . The justices struck down three provisions : That it \u2019 s a state crime to be in the country without proper authorization , a state crime for an undocumented worker to apply for a job or to work in Arizona , and that state law enforcement officials can arrest a person who is in the United States legally , but who the police believe may have committed a deportable offense \u2013without a warrant .\nIn each of those cases , the majority said those powers rest with the federal government , not with Arizona lawmakers .\nBut it refused to overturn the most controversial section of the Arizona law , which requires the police to check the immigration status of people they detain before releasing them . The Supreme Court said a lower court had erred in blocking this law , because there is no evidence yet that its enforcement would pre-empt federal law .\nArguing the pre-emption case against that part of the Arizona statute was always a weak approach . The real problem with the \u201c papers please \u201d law is the risk of racial profiling , which would be a violation of the civil rights of those detained \u2013 and could lead to lawful residents being harassed and even jailed by the authorities . Given Arizona \u2019 s history on these matters ( Joe Arpaio\u2026 ) I have little doubt that will happen . But at least today \u2019 s ruling left open the possibility that the one surviving part of the Arizona law could be brought back to court if it is enforced unconstitutionally .\nAmong all the quick reactions to the Arizona ruling , I found Mitt Romney \u2019 s most disappointing . He blamed President Obama , saying that the ruling was somehow a result of his lack of \u201c leadership on immigration. \u201d That \u2019 s just silly . The stalemate on immigration is as much , if not more , the fault of hard line Republicans than that of Mr. Obama . Remember , just a few weeks ago , during the G.O.P . primaries , Mr. Romney was one of those hard line Republicans .\nDavid Firestone will weigh in later today on the Court \u2019 s decision to strike down\u2014 without oral argument \u2014 a Montana ban on corporate spending in elections .",
