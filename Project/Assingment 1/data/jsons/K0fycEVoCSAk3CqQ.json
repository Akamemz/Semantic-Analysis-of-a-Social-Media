But he has made clear he won \u2019 t bankroll his bid through November , and he \u2019 s still a long way from the $ 300 million his backers say they hope to raise \u2014 already a retreat from Trump 's original $ 1 billion goal .\nMeanwhile , the Clinton campaign and its allied super PAC have already amassed more than $ 300 million .\nThe May FEC report showed just 69 people on payroll , to Clinton \u2019 s 685 .
