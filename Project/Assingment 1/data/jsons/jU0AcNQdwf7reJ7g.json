The big biz of spying on little kids\nThe NSA has nothing on the ed tech startup known as Knewton .\nThe data analytics firm has peered into the brains of more than 4 million students across the country .

I \u2019 m just helping her learn . \u201d\nThe U.S. Department of Education has called safeguarding children \u2019 s privacy a priority . \u201c That has to be first , that has to be foremost , that \u2019 s absolutely paramount , \u201d Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a recent video chat posted by the department .\nYet the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act , written when the floppy disk was just coming into vogue , offers only limited protections .\nThe 1974 law , known as FERPA , explicitly gives school districts the right to share students \u2019 personal information with private companies to further educational goals .\nCompanies are supposed to keep standardized test scores , disciplinary history and other official student records confidential \u2014 and not use it for their own purposes .

But Kathleen Styles , the Education Department \u2019 s chief privacy officer , acknowledged in an interview that much of it is likely not protected by FERPA \u2014 and thus can be commercialized by the companies that hold it .\nDistricts could write privacy protections into their contracts with ed tech companies . But few do .\nA recent national study found that just 7 percent of the contracts between districts and tech companies handling student data barred the companies from selling it for profit .\nFew contracts required the companies to delete sensitive data when they were done with it . And just one in four clearly explained why the company needed personal student information in the first place , according to the study , conducted by the Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham University .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know what these companies are doing with our children \u2019 s data , \u201d said Joel Reidenberg , the Fordham law professor who conducted the study .\nA White House report on big data released earlier this month recognized the risk , and called for updating FERPA . Sen. Ed Markey ( D-Mass . ) and Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) on Wednesday began circulating a draft bill to do just that . Their bill would tighten controls on student records and give parents the right to review \u2014 and correct \u2014 some of the information that private companies hold on their children . But the bill only covers official student educational records , not the streams of \u201c metadata \u201d that companies collect when kids work online .\nThere \u2019 s no conclusive proof any company has exploited either metadata or official student records . But privacy experts say it \u2019 s almost impossible to tell . The marketplace in personal data is shadowy and its impact on any one individual can be subtle : Who can say for sure if they \u2019 re being bombarded with a certain ad or rebuffed by a particular employer because their personal profile has been mined and sold ?\nEd tech insiders will not name bad actors in their industry . But they will say this : It \u2019 s quite possible to exploit student data \u2014 and there can be a great deal of pressure to do so , especially for startups that are giving away their product for free in hopes of gaining a toe-hold in classrooms .\nUnless your product is good enough to sell , \u201c there \u2019 s this huge temptation to just make money by selling or exploiting data , \u201d said Matthew Rubinstein , the founder and CEO of LiveSchool , which markets software that helps schools track student behavior .\nChildren \u2019 s personal information \u201c is splintering across the Internet , \u201d said Cameron Evans , Microsoft \u2019 s chief technology officer . \u201c Anonymity is going to be more valuable than gold in the near future . \u201d\nEd-tech companies divide into two main camps . Some serve as digital file cabinets for pre-existing student records ; they \u2019 re basically organizational tools . Others deliver lessons and quizzes online and collect fresh data directly from students as they work .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 examination found that both can carry privacy risks .\nTake LearnBoost , a startup backed by prominent venture capital firms . It \u2019 s marketed as a \u201c free and amazing \u201d tool that lets teachers upload their notes on student attendance , test scores , behavior and more to a digital grade book . Any teacher can sign up , even if her district doesn \u2019 t participate .\nA key element of the pitch : LearnBoost makes it easy for teachers to email the grade book to parents , students and others \u201c as they see fit . \u201d\nLearnBoost does note in passing that confidential student data should be shared \u201c very carefully. \u201d But it offers no guidelines . And privacy advocates find it alarming that a for-profit startup is holding student records and making it easy for teachers to send them zipping around the Internet without supervision from the district .\nOther sites receive huge amounts of student information directly from schools or districts . The data management site LearnSprout , for instance , stores information such as attendance records , which can be granular to the point of noting head lice , a cold , a doctor \u2019 s appointment or bereavement \u2014 to name just a few of the categories . Interactive Health Technologies stores multi-year fitness records on students , based on data from heart monitors they wear in P.E. , and integrates them with \u201c unlimited data points \u201d from the classroom , including behavioral and nutrition records .\nKnowing so much personal data is in a private company \u2019 s hands worries some parents , especially in the wake of the cyberattack that stole credit card numbers from tens of millions of Target customers last winter .\nK-12 districts and contractors haven \u2019 t reported any major data breaches , but it \u2019 s been a recurring problem for colleges . In one of the worst incidents , hackers attacked the University of Maryland in February and scooped up records \u2014 including social security numbers \u2014 for nearly 300,000 students , faculty and staff .\nOther companies hold more even more intimate , and potentially more valuable , information on children .\nConsider the popular nonprofit tutorial service Khan Academy . It \u2019 s free . But users do pay a price : In effect , they trade their data for the tutoring .\n\u201c Data is the real asset , \u201d founder Sal Khan told an academic conference last fall .\nThe site tracks the academic progress of students 13 and older as they work through online lessons in math , science and other subjects . It also logs their location when they sign in and monitors their Web browsing habits . And it reserves the right to seek out personal details about users from other sources , as well , potentially building rich profiles of their interests and connections .\nAfter \u2588\u2588\u2588 inquired about Khan Academy \u2019 s privacy policy , which gave it the right to draw on students \u2019 personal information to send them customized advertising , the policy was completely rewritten . The new text , posted online late last week , emphasizes Khan Academy \u2019 s commitment to protecting privacy and deletes the line about targeted advertising .\nBut the revised policy makes clear that Khan Academy still allows third parties , such as YouTube and Google , to place the tiny text files known as \u201c cookies \u201d on students \u2019 computers to collect and store information about their Web usage . Khan Academy also states that it may share personal information with app developers and other external partners , with students \u2019 consent .\nA spokeswoman for the site said Khan Academy \u2019 s main goal in collecting data is to \u201c help students learn effectively and efficiently . \u201d\nParents and teachers typically turn to companies \u2019 privacy policies to try to figure out what student data is being collected and how it could be used . Clarity is a rarity .\nEven companies that assert they do not sell personal information typically reserve the right to change that policy at any time . Most won \u2019 t notify users in the event of such a change . Instead , they recommend reading the online privacy policy regularly to see if it \u2019 s been updated .\nMost policies also indicate that student information will trade hands , and may be subject to an entirely new privacy policy , if the company is sold \u2014 a common fate for a start-up .\nThen there \u2019 s the legal jargon and fuzzy terminology to unravel .\nMoodle , which many schools use as a forum for students to post work and communicate with teachers , states that it won \u2019 t share users \u2019 personal information \u2014 \u201c but it may be accessible to those volunteers and staff who administer the site and infrastructure. \u201d Who are those volunteers ? Are they trained to protect user privacy ? The site lists an email address for users to get more information , but questions sent to that address bounced back .\nGoogle \u2019 s privacy policy is considerably more detailed , but until recently , it did not make clear that the company scanned all emails sent through its Google Apps for Education platform , which is used by millions of students and teachers . The automated scan picked out key words that might suggest a user was , say , planning a camping trip . Google could then use that information to target ads to that individual . It did not routinely send ads to students , but it did direct them to alumni who used the Google Apps for Education platform .\nAfter angry students filed a lawsuit , Google updated its terms of service to acknowledge the email scanning \u2014 and then announced late last month that it would stop the practice altogether for customers using Apps for Education .\nOther companies don \u2019 t make any privacy policy at all available for parents to review , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has found .\nThe data storage and analytics firm eScholar , which sells software to help districts manage records on 20 million students \u2014 and stores some of that data on its servers \u2014 does not have a posted privacy policy . Spokeswoman Ann Tarasena said the company is working on it . In the meantime , eScholar writes privacy protections into its contracts with districts . It wouldn \u2019 t release the contracts \u2014 citing privacy concerns .\nOn Thursday , responding to questions raised by this article , the company posted online a statement of its general privacy principles , including a pledge not to sell student data .\nThen there \u2019 s Panorama Education , a data analytics platform used by thousands of schools and backed by investors including Facebook \u2019 s Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher .\nCEO Aaron Feuer said the company abides by each district \u2019 s privacy rules , but it does not have a blanket policy to share with the public .\nThe lack of consistent standards troubles Sen. Markey , who has become a leading voice on consumer privacy in Congress .\n\u201c The goal here should be to help scholars make the grade , \u201d Markey said , \u201c not help companies make a sale . \u201d\nIn recent months , more than 30 public school districts from Bainbridge Island , Washington , to Broward County , Florida , have signed partnerships with a nonprofit called Code.org . The organization gives schools free curricular materials and teacher training to set up computer science classes .\nAll it asks for in exchange : Data . Lots and lots of data .\nCode.org requires that its partner schools turn over up to a dozen years of academic records , including test scores , on every participating student , according to a model contract reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn addition to their official academic records , Code.org collects huge amounts of new information on participating students as they watch the tutorials and do the activities on its website . It collects their computer login , email address and password and captures their interaction with the website , including searches conducted on the site .\nCode.org \u2019 s privacy policy is a bit confusing . It says it does not share personal information with third parties . It promises not to share it , either , with the organization \u2019 s donors or sponsors , among them Facebook \u2019 s Zuckerberg and Microsoft \u2019 s Bill Gates .\nBut the policy goes on to say it may provide personal information to \u201c schools , teachers and affiliated organizations. \u201d It explicitly states that Code.org does not control how that information \u201c is later used by them or shared with others . \u201d\nThe policy doesn \u2019 t define \u201c affiliated organizations \u201d or explain how access is determined . Nor does it explain what Code.org does with its voluminous student files or how it protects them .\nOfficials in some districts that have signed up with Code.org said they were comfortable with handing over the data because they assumed it would be aggregated and anonymized \u2014 though the contract makes no mention of that \u2014 and used to gauge the effectiveness of the program . \u201c That kind of analysis and research goes on all the time , \u201d said Robert Runcie , superintendent in Broward County . \u201c It \u2019 s not a problem . \u201d\nOthers said they didn \u2019 t realize when they signed the contract how much data would be turned over .\nOn Thursday , in response to this article , Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi posted an open letter stating that the organization only sought anonymized data and would update and clarify its privacy policy .\nTo Doug Levin , who runs an association of state educational technology directors , the ambiguity of the Code.org policy is an astonishing example of how little attention is being paid to protecting student privacy .\n\u201c That \u2019 s just unacceptable , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean , you \u2019 re just throwing potentially sensitive information over the wall in the hopes that there won \u2019 t be any issue. \u201d The contracts highlight the danger of the ed tech explosion , Levin said : When it comes to protecting privacy , \u201c the rules of the road are not real clear . \u201d\nFor all the concerns about privacy , education reformers are adamant that the digital revolution must be allowed to flourish .\nAlready , publishers are producing digital textbooks that can effectively read students \u2019 minds , figuring out when they \u2019 re on the verge of forgetting key concepts and sending them text , video or quizzes to fix the facts firmly in their memory .\nEven more intimate tracking may be possible in the future : The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded a $ 1.4 million research project in 2012 to outfit middle-school students with biometric sensors designed to detect how they responded on an a subconscious level to each minute of each lesson . The results suggested the sensors could be useful for teachers , foundation spokeswoman Deborah Robinson said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re really just at the beginning of truly leveraging the power of data to transform the process of teaching and learning , \u201d said Aimee Rogstad Guidera , executive director of the Data Quality Campaign , which urges states to develop responsible policies for data-driven education .\n\u201c When we take the time to explain to parents why this is good and how it \u2019 s going to help , they \u2019 re fine with it , \u201d Guidera said .\nTo Barmak Nassirian , a father of two and grassroots privacy activist , the question boils down to this : No matter how well they safeguard the data , no matter how stringent their privacy policies , do you want private companies \u201c to get into your kid \u2019 s head and mine the learning process for profit ? \u201d\nInvestors , after all , are pouring into the sector because they expect it to make money , not because \u2014 or at least , not only because \u2014 they believe it will help kids learn .\n\u201c Their mission isn \u2019 t a social mission , \u201d said Michael Moe , co-founder of GSV Capital , a leading investor in ed-tech companies . \u201c They \u2019 re there to create return . \u201d\nMore than $ 650 million flowed into technology firms serving the K-12 and higher education market last year . That \u2019 s nearly double the $ 331 million invested in those spheres in 2009 , Moe said . Nationwide , the market for education software and digital content stands at nearly $ 8 billion , according to the Software & Information Industry Association .\nIt \u2019 s not entirely clear that all those apps boost achievement ; a recent national survey commissioned by the Gates Foundation found just 54 percent of teachers considered the digital tools their students use frequently to be effective .\nGiven that uncertainty , the data companies collect on students could be their most valuable assets .\nPublishers of digital textbooks , for instance , could potentially use their insights on students \u2019 academic progress to pitch them \u2014 or , more likely , their parents \u2014 new products targeted directly at their needs .\n\u201c In the industry , there \u2019 s a lot of desire to do that , \u201d said Andrew Bloom , chief privacy officer for McGraw-Hill Education . Bloom stressed that McGraw-Hill has no plans to do such marketing unless school districts consent .\nKhaliah Barnes , director of the student privacy project for the Electronic Privacy Information Center , can imagine another scenario : Companies with rich student dossiers could market aptitude and attitude profiles to college admissions or corporate recruiting offices .\n\u201c As an employer , that \u2019 s the sort of profile I would want to buy : Who can solve a problem quickly ? Who has the tenacity to finish all the problems ? Who drops off quickly ? \u201d Barnes said .\nFerreira , the CEO of the New York data analytics firm Knewton , said he \u2019 s not planning to create such profiles . \u201c But I suppose I can imagine a future where it happens , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure how I feel about that. \u201d If such profiles were to come into use , he said , Knewton would not sell or share them without students \u2019 consent .\nA model state bill drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council , a conservative lobbying group , could make such targeting more likely ; it would set up a central state database for student records and allow colleges or businesses to browse them in search of potential recruits .\nCompanies might also seek to mine student profiles to find customers uniquely vulnerable to their sales pitches . For instance , young adults who struggled with high-school math could be bombarded with ads for high-priced payday loans , Barnes said .\nSuch prospects may sound far-fetched , but the recent White House report on big data acknowledged it as a very real possibility . Data collected on children as they take advantage of educational services \u201c could be used to build an invasive consumer profile of them once they become adults , \u201d the report concluded .\nKnewton \u2019 s Ferreira is impatient with alarmist scenarios and anxious parents .\nHe once described education as \u201c the world \u2019 s most data-mineable industry , by far \u201d \u2014 and he has raised $ 105 million from investors who share that vision . By next year , he expects to be mapping the minds of 10 million students . If he can identify who among them will struggle with fractions next Thursday , he can also recommend resources to help them before they hit that wall .\nFerreira has a tough time understanding how anyone could object to data mining when it has such power .\n\u201c It just helps children , \u201d Ferreira said . \u201c That \u2019 s all it does . \u201d",

Others deliver lessons and quizzes online and collect fresh data directly from students as they work.\n\nThe POLITICO examination found that both can carry privacy risks.\n\nTake LearnBoost, a startup backed by prominent venture capital firms. It\u2019s marketed as a \u201cfree and amazing\u201d tool that lets teachers upload their notes on student attendance, test scores, behavior and more to a digital grade book. Any teacher can sign up, even if her district doesn\u2019t participate.\n\nA key element of the pitch: LearnBoost makes it easy for teachers to email the grade book to parents, students and others \u201cas they see fit.\u201d\n\nLearnBoost does note in passing that confidential student data should be shared \u201cvery carefully.\u201d But it offers no guidelines. And privacy advocates find it alarming that a for-profit startup is holding student records and making it easy for teachers to send them zipping around the Internet without supervision from the district.\n\nThe company did not return emails seeking comment.\n\nOther sites receive huge amounts of student information directly from schools or districts. The data management site LearnSprout, for instance, stores information such as attendance records, which can be granular to the point of noting head lice, a cold, a doctor\u2019s appointment or bereavement \u2014 to name just a few of the categories. Interactive Health Technologies stores multi-year fitness records on students, based on data from heart monitors they wear in P.E., and integrates them with \u201cunlimited data points\u201d from the classroom, including behavioral and nutrition records.\n\nKnowing so much personal data is in a private company\u2019s hands worries some parents, especially in the wake of the cyberattack that stole credit card numbers from tens of millions of Target customers last winter.\n\nK-12 districts and contractors haven\u2019t reported any major data breaches, but it\u2019s been a recurring problem for colleges. In one of the worst incidents, hackers attacked the University of Maryland in February and scooped up records \u2014 including social security numbers \u2014 for nearly 300,000 students, faculty and staff.\n\nOther companies hold more even more intimate, and potentially more valuable, information on children.\n\nConsider the popular nonprofit tutorial service Khan Academy. It\u2019s free. But users do pay a price: In effect, they trade their data for the tutoring.\n\n\u201cData is the real asset,\u201d founder Sal Khan told an academic conference last fall.\n\nThe site tracks the academic progress of students 13 and older as they work through online lessons in math, science and other subjects. It also logs their location when they sign in and monitors their Web browsing habits. And it reserves the right to seek out personal details about users from other sources, as well, potentially building rich profiles of their interests and connections.\n\nAfter POLITICO inquired about Khan Academy\u2019s privacy policy, which gave it the right to draw on students\u2019 personal information to send them customized advertising, the policy was completely rewritten. The new text, posted online late last week, emphasizes Khan Academy\u2019s commitment to protecting privacy and deletes the line about targeted advertising.\n\nBut the revised policy makes clear that Khan Academy still allows third parties, such as YouTube and Google, to place the tiny text files known as \u201ccookies\u201d on students\u2019 computers to collect and store information about their Web usage. Khan Academy also states that it may share personal information with app developers and other external partners, with students\u2019 consent.\n\nA spokeswoman for the site said Khan Academy\u2019s main goal in collecting data is to \u201chelp students learn effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\nMURKY PRIVACY POLICIES \u2014 OR NONE AT ALL\n\nParents and teachers typically turn to companies\u2019 privacy policies to try to figure out what student data is being collected and how it could be used. Clarity is a rarity.\n\nEven companies that assert they do not sell personal information typically reserve the right to change that policy at any time. Most won\u2019t notify users in the event of such a change. Instead, they recommend reading the online privacy policy regularly to see if it\u2019s been updated.\n\nMost policies also indicate that student information will trade hands, and may be subject to an entirely new privacy policy, if the company is sold \u2014 a common fate for a start-up.\n\nThen there\u2019s the legal jargon and fuzzy terminology to unravel.\n\nMoodle, which many schools use as a forum for students to post work and communicate with teachers, states that it won\u2019t share users\u2019 personal information \u2014 \u201cbut it may be accessible to those volunteers and staff who administer the site and infrastructure.\u201d Who are those volunteers? Are they trained to protect user privacy? The site lists an email address for users to get more information, but questions sent to that address bounced back.\n\nGoogle\u2019s privacy policy is considerably more detailed, but until recently, it did not make clear that the company scanned all emails sent through its Google Apps for Education platform, which is used by millions of students and teachers. The automated scan picked out key words that might suggest a user was, say, planning a camping trip. Google could then use that information to target ads to that individual. It did not routinely send ads to students, but it did direct them to alumni who used the Google Apps for Education platform.\n\nAfter angry students filed a lawsuit, Google updated its terms of service to acknowledge the email scanning \u2014 and then announced late last month that it would stop the practice altogether for customers using Apps for Education.\n\nOther companies don\u2019t make any privacy policy at all available for parents to review, POLITICO has found.\n\nThe data storage and analytics firm eScholar, which sells software to help districts manage records on 20 million students \u2014 and stores some of that data on its servers \u2014 does not have a posted privacy policy. Spokeswoman Ann Tarasena said the company is working on it. In the meantime, eScholar writes privacy protections into its contracts with districts. It wouldn\u2019t release the contracts \u2014 citing privacy concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, responding to questions raised by this article, the company posted online a statement of its general privacy principles, including a pledge not to sell student data.\n\nThen there\u2019s Panorama Education, a data analytics platform used by thousands of schools and backed by investors including Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher.\n\nCEO Aaron Feuer said the company abides by each district\u2019s privacy rules, but it does not have a blanket policy to share with the public.\n\nThe lack of consistent standards troubles Sen. Markey, who has become a leading voice on consumer privacy in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe goal here should be to help scholars make the grade,\u201d Markey said, \u201cnot help companies make a sale.\u201d\n\nDATA DEMANDS ESCALATE\n\nIn recent months, more than 30 public school districts from Bainbridge Island, Washington, to Broward County, Florida, have signed partnerships with a nonprofit called Code.org. The organization gives schools free curricular materials and teacher training to set up computer science classes.\n\nAll it asks for in exchange: Data. Lots and lots of data.\n\nCode.org requires that its partner schools turn over up to a dozen years of academic records, including test scores, on every participating student, according to a model contract reviewed by POLITICO.\n\nIn addition to their official academic records, Code.org collects huge amounts of new information on participating students as they watch the tutorials and do the activities on its website. It collects their computer login, email address and password and captures their interaction with the website, including searches conducted on the site.\n\nCode.org\u2019s privacy policy is a bit confusing. It says it does not share personal information with third parties. It promises not to share it, either, with the organization\u2019s donors or sponsors, among them Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates.\n\nBut the policy goes on to say it may provide personal information to \u201cschools, teachers and affiliated organizations.\u201d It explicitly states that Code.org does not control how that information \u201cis later used by them or shared with others.\u201d\n\nThe policy doesn\u2019t define \u201caffiliated organizations\u201d or explain how access is determined. Nor does it explain what Code.org does with its voluminous student files or how it protects them.\n\nSpokeswoman Roxanne Emadi declined to discuss those issues.\n\nOfficials in some districts that have signed up with Code.org said they were comfortable with handing over the data because they assumed it would be aggregated and anonymized \u2014 though the contract makes no mention of that \u2014 and used to gauge the effectiveness of the program. \u201cThat kind of analysis and research goes on all the time,\u201d said Robert Runcie, superintendent in Broward County. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\n\nOthers said they didn\u2019t realize when they signed the contract how much data would be turned over.\n\nOn Thursday, in response to this article, Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi posted an open letter stating that the organization only sought anonymized data and would update and clarify its privacy policy.\n\nTo Doug Levin, who runs an association of state educational technology directors, the ambiguity of the Code.org policy is an astonishing example of how little attention is being paid to protecting student privacy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re just throwing potentially sensitive information over the wall in the hopes that there won\u2019t be any issue.\u201d The contracts highlight the danger of the ed tech explosion, Levin said: When it comes to protecting privacy, \u201cthe rules of the road are not real clear.\u201d\n\nTHE PROMISE OF BIG DATA\n\nFor all the concerns about privacy, education reformers are adamant that the digital revolution must be allowed to flourish.\n\nAlready, publishers are producing digital textbooks that can effectively read students\u2019 minds, figuring out when they\u2019re on the verge of forgetting key concepts and sending them text, video or quizzes to fix the facts firmly in their memory.\n\nEven more intimate tracking may be possible in the future: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded a $1.4 million research project in 2012 to outfit middle-school students with biometric sensors designed to detect how they responded on an a subconscious level to each minute of each lesson. The results suggested the sensors could be useful for teachers, foundation spokeswoman Deborah Robinson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really just at the beginning of truly leveraging the power of data to transform the process of teaching and learning,\u201d said Aimee Rogstad Guidera, executive director of the Data Quality Campaign, which urges states to develop responsible policies for data-driven education.\n\n\u201cWhen we take the time to explain to parents why this is good and how it\u2019s going to help, they\u2019re fine with it,\u201d Guidera said.\n\nNot all parents, however, are convinced.\n\nTo Barmak Nassirian, a father of two and grassroots privacy activist, the question boils down to this: No matter how well they safeguard the data, no matter how stringent their privacy policies, do you want private companies \u201cto get into your kid\u2019s head and mine the learning process for profit?\u201d\n\nInvestors, after all, are pouring into the sector because they expect it to make money, not because \u2014 or at least, not only because \u2014 they believe it will help kids learn.\n\n\u201cTheir mission isn\u2019t a social mission,\u201d said Michael Moe, co-founder of GSV Capital, a leading investor in ed-tech companies. \u201cThey\u2019re there to create return.\u201d\n\nMore than $650 million flowed into technology firms serving the K-12 and higher education market last year. That\u2019s nearly double the $331 million invested in those spheres in 2009, Moe said. Nationwide, the market for education software and digital content stands at nearly $8 billion, according to the Software & Information Industry Association.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear that all those apps boost achievement; a recent national survey commissioned by the Gates Foundation found just 54 percent of teachers considered the digital tools their students use frequently to be effective.\n\nGiven that uncertainty, the data companies collect on students could be their most valuable assets.\n\nPublishers of digital textbooks, for instance, could potentially use their insights on students\u2019 academic progress to pitch them \u2014 or, more likely, their parents \u2014 new products targeted directly at their needs.\n\n\u201cIn the industry, there\u2019s a lot of desire to do that,\u201d said Andrew Bloom, chief privacy officer for McGraw-Hill Education. Bloom stressed that McGraw-Hill has no plans to do such marketing unless school districts consent.\n\nKhaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, can imagine another scenario: Companies with rich student dossiers could market aptitude and attitude profiles to college admissions or corporate recruiting offices.\n\n\u201cAs an employer, that\u2019s the sort of profile I would want to buy: Who can solve a problem quickly? Who has the tenacity to finish all the problems? Who drops off quickly?\u201d Barnes said.\n\nFerreira, the CEO of the New York data analytics firm Knewton, said he\u2019s not planning to create such profiles. \u201cBut I suppose I can imagine a future where it happens,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.\u201d If such profiles were to come into use, he said, Knewton would not sell or share them without students\u2019 consent.\n\nA model state bill drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative lobbying group, could make such targeting more likely; it would set up a central state database for student records and allow colleges or businesses to browse them in search of potential recruits.\n\nCompanies might also seek to mine student profiles to find customers uniquely vulnerable to their sales pitches. For instance, young adults who struggled with high-school math could be bombarded with ads for high-priced payday loans, Barnes said.\n\nSuch prospects may sound far-fetched, but the recent White House report on big data acknowledged it as a very real possibility. Data collected on children as they take advantage of educational services \u201ccould be used to build an invasive consumer profile of them once they become adults,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nKnewton\u2019s Ferreira is impatient with alarmist scenarios and anxious parents.\n\nHe once described education as \u201cthe world\u2019s most data-mineable industry, by far\u201d \u2014 and he has raised $105 million from investors who share that vision. By next year, he expects to be mapping the minds of 10 million students. If he can identify who among them will struggle with fractions next Thursday, he can also recommend resources to help them before they hit that wall.\n\nFerreira has a tough time understanding how anyone could object to data mining when it has such power.\n\n\u201cIt just helps children,\u201d Ferreira said. \u201cThat\u2019s all it does.\u201d",
