And , indeed , there \u2019 s precious little sign that it will happen \u2014 in part because an atmosphere of partisan hostility serves Trump \u2019 s interests .\nTrump won a primary election by criticizing the Republican Party establishment , adopted a set of heterodox policy stances that sometimes poached centrist and left-wing ideas along with hard-right ones , and won a general election without much in the way of formal support for the institutional Republican Party .\nUnder the circumstances , attempting to govern as a less-partisan figure than Barack Obama or George W. Bush who is more interested in making cross-aisle deals seems like a natural possibility . It \u2019 s an approach Trump clearly rejected in the first couple of months of his administration , trying to pass a health care law on a party-line basis and putting forward a hard-right budget proposal copied more or less directly from the Heritage Foundation website .\nDespite the White House \u2019 s various suggestions of bipartisan cooperation to the press , there \u2019 s been no substantive engagement with the other party .
