In a now-edited announcement on its website , Ann Taylor said it was closing its stores March 18\u201328 . \u201c Our associates are at the heart of what we do , and they will be paid for their scheduled shifts during this time , \u201d Gary Muto , the CEO of Ascena Retail Group , whose brands include Ann Taylor , Loft , and Lou & Grey , said in the announcement . After \u2588\u2588\u2588 reached out to Ann Taylor for comment on the morning of March 27 , the part about paying store associates was removed from Muto \u2019 s statement on the website .\nThe Ann Taylor store manager told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that store associates \u201c got absolutely nothing. \u201d \u201c No pay at all , \u201d she said . \u201c If they did get paid , it was the people who usually work 25-plus hours , and we snuck them on for three hours for one day to cover managers ' breaks. \u201d She said that Ann Taylor first directed managers like her to cut associates \u2019 shifts back on March 12 , a week before stores closed . A few days later , more associates \u2019 shifts were cut when Ann Taylor reduced store hours . Then , on March 16 , managers were told to operate on \u201c minimum coverage , \u201d which meant that only two people from the management team would be scheduled to work , she said . This meant that no associates were put on the schedule .\n\u201c This was a full 24 hours before we knew we were closing , \u201d she said . \u201c We had associates on the other side of the phone crying , saying we couldn \u2019 t cut their shifts because they wouldn \u2019 t be able to pay rent . It was one of the worst things I \u2019 ve ever witnessed. \u201d So when Ann Taylor publicly announced the next day that it would pay store associates through the closures , it caused confusion and anger among employees , the manager said . \u201c The store associates were calling and texting , asking if they were getting paid now \u2014 after we had just told them they weren \u2019 t getting paid , \u201d the manager said . \u201c It didn \u2019 t just mislead the public ; it misled the people who work for the company. \u201d A company spokesperson declined to comment .\n@ PButterfield18 Ann Taylor LOFT made stores SIGNIFICANTLY cut back on payroll , had store managers make a new schedule giving part-time associates maybe 4 hours/week IF that , then announced they are closing and associates get what they are scheduled . This is through the 28th . Unknown after that .\nThe company has since furloughed all store associates until it can reopen stores .\n\u201c We found out on March 24th that we had to call everyone from home and tell them they were furloughed , \u201d the Ann Taylor manager said . \u201c Associates are able to use up the rest of their sick time if they choose to , which they have very little of . ''\nIn a letter to employees published on StreetInsider.com , Muto said , \u201c Furloughing our [ store ] associates is one of the most challenging decisions we have ever had to make as an organization . \u201d\nHe said that it was \u201c incredibly disheartening \u201d for the company to take this step \u201c due to the unpredictable and unimaginable impact of COVID-19. \u201d \u201c I want you to know that as a furloughed associate , you are still very much part of our team , and it is our goal to recall you to work as soon as possible , \u201d Muto \u2019 s letter said .\nThe Ann Taylor employee said the company used managers like her as \u201c puppets \u201d and made them look like \u201c the bad guys. \u201d She said that other managers she has talked to across the company \u2019 s brands felt that the company had treated store employees unfairly . \u201c When we go back to work I am going to have a team full of women who dislike me because the company made us the bad guys , \u201d she said . \u201c We were the people responsible for doing all these awful things . \u201d\nRandy Hoeft / Yuma Sun via AP A sign on the door to an American Eagle in Arizona .\nIn a news release March 17 , American Eagle Outfitters announced it was closing its stores at least until March 27 and that \u201c all store associates will be compensated for scheduled time during that period. \u201d Naomi Slack , a store associate at an American Eagle in Oklahoma City , called the statement a `` cleverly worded lie . '' Slack , 43 , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that while American Eagle said it would pay associates for `` scheduled '' shifts , it did n't say `` we 'll just take you off the schedule . '' `` That 's so shitty , '' Slack said .\nSlack , who was hired at American Eagle a little over a week before it closed its stores , was expecting to be scheduled for at least 10 hours a week as a part-time store associate . But on Tuesday , when Slack logged into the employee website to check how many hours she would be getting paid for , `` I felt like I got punched in the gut . '' `` I got zero hours because I got scheduled for zero hours , '' Slack said . Slack , who still has her day job at another company , said she was depending on the approximately $ 100 she would have gotten from American Eagle to go toward her medical treatments and the `` extra money I need every month to make sure I do n't overdraft my checking account by pay day . '' Slack said American Eagle 's statement to the public and to employees about paying store associates for their scheduled shifts did not clarify that some associates like her would not get scheduled at all . `` They should n't get the press they 're getting for being kind to their employees . when they 're not , '' she said . Slack provided \u2588\u2588\u2588 with screenshots of group chats in which her store manager informed associates about closures and the pay schedule during that period . In one message on March 18 , Slack 's coworker asked their store manager , `` So we will get scheduled but not have to come in and we will get payed [ sic ] for those days ! ! ''\nThe store manager replied , `` That 's the idea BUT if corporate feels we 'overscheduled ' they can pull the hours out . Hopefully we fell into their guidelines . ''\nHe later added that not everyone was scheduled and that priority was given to leaders and core associates .\n`` Then if hours were left , we could schedule flex associates , '' Slack 's store manager said in the chat . Slack told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she had never been told she was a `` flex associate '' and did not even know what that meant . When she found out she had not been scheduled to work at all during the store closures , Slack asked the store manager about it . `` I know that you guys were going to scale down but I did n't think it would be to zero [ hours ] , '' Slack told him . `` We only had a limited amount of hours to use , '' her manager replied . `` The priority was full time at 40 then our core staff at at least 12. after that there really was n't much to use . ''\nWhen Slack lamented to him about needing the money , the manager told her , `` It 's something new none of us have gone through . '' Slack said she will look for another second job soon . She said that American Eagle should have paid all their store associates for the two weeks .\n`` They have more than enough money to do it , '' she said . `` It 's a billion-dollar brand . '' In a message to her direct manager , Slack complained about the company 's misleading statement . `` It 's shady , '' Slack said in the message . `` Feels like a dirty trick after what they said cuz I could have started working on another job somewhere else 3 weeks ago . '' Her manager replied , `` I understand how frustrating it can be , just know that you are not alone . '' A 21-year-old store associate for American Eagle in Oregon told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the company 's statement about paying store associates was \u201c misleading . ''\nOn March 16 , the associate \u2014 who did not wish to be identified for fear of losing her job \u2014 said she got a call from her manager after the company shortened their store hours . She was scheduled to work for three shifts that week , but due to the reduced hours , the manager had to cut two of the shifts . The next day , she found out \u2014 through an American Eagle mass email sent to all customers on their subscription list \u2014 that it was closing all its stores . Only after that email did her store manager tell associates via group text that their store was closing . \u201c So before the decision to close the store was made , associates were called and asked to reschedule or cut their shifts , that they otherwise would have been compensated for , \u201d the associate told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . She said that if her scheduled shifts had not been cut she would have made $ 135 ( before taxes ) for the week . After two of her three shifts were cut , she made only $ 45 for the week after stores closed . \u201c While I am thankful for the time I was compensated for , it \u2019 s upsetting that what I would have normally been paid was cut over half for my last check until further notice , \u201d the associate said . \u201c This has affected me greatly financially . Like many store employees , I do not know when I will be making an income again , and am having trouble applying for unemployment since American Eagle has not laid off their employees yet. \u201d The company did not reopen its stores on March 27 as previously announced , and associates have not heard from the company about when the stores will likely reopen or if they will be paid during this time . She does n't know of any associate who had shifts scheduled this far out , which means they would n't be compensated . She added that there has been \u201c minimal communication \u201d from American Eagle .\nThe assistant store manager sent associates a group text March 27 informing them about how they could send photos to be posted to the store \u2019 s Instagram account during the closure .\nThe manager \u201c casually mentioned , \u2018 While we don \u2019 t have a date for when we return\u2026 \u2019 but did not expand on that , \u201d the associate said .\nOn Monday , the store assistant manager contacted the associates on group text to tell them the company had given associates a coupon code for 25 % off . \u201c Not exactly the compensation some of us were hoping for , \u201d the associate said .\nShe said that associates still haven \u2019 t received a company email about what the continued store closures mean for store employees .\n\u201c I unfortunately do feel the company could be handling this situation better , \u201d she said . \u201c I feel at the very least , clear and consistent communication directly with the employees would make a positive difference. \u201d American Eagle Outfitters did not return multiple requests for comment .\nGado Images / Sipa USA via AP An Anthropologie store in California in 2019 .\nURBN , which includes brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , Free People , BHLDN , and Terrain , publicly announced it was closing all its global stores on March 14 and that it would continue to pay store employees .
