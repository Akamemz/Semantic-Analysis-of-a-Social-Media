It is a contract between myself and the American voter \u2014 and begins with restoring honesty , accountability and change to Washington .\nTherefore , on the first day of my term of office , my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington , DC :\n* FIRST , propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress ; 1\n* SECOND , a hiring freeze on all federal employees1 to reduce federal workforce through attrition ( exempting military , public safety , and public health ) ;\n* THIRD , a requirement that for every new federal regulation , two existing regulations must be eliminated ; 1\n* FOURTH , a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists1 after they leave government service ;\n* FIFTH , a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government ; 1\n* SIXTH , a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.1\nOn the same day , I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers :\n* FIRST , I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 22051\n* SECOND , I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership1\n* THIRD , I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator1\n* FOURTH , I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers1 and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately\n* FIFTH , I will lift the restrictions on the production of $ 50 trillion dollars ' worth of job-producing American energy reserves,1 including shale , oil , natural gas and clean coal .\n* SIXTH , lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects , like the Keystone Pipeline , to move forward1\n* SEVENTH , cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs1 and use the money to fix America 's water and environmental infrastructure\nAdditionally , on the first day , I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law :\n* FIRST , cancel every unconstitutional executive action , memorandum and order issued by President Obama1\n* SECOND , begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia1 from one of the 20 judges on my list , who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States\n* FOURTH , begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country1 and cancel visas to foreign countries that wo n't take them back2\n* FIFTH , suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting can not safely occur .

Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act.1 An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4 % per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification , in combination with trade reform , regulatory relief , and lifting the restrictions on American energy . The largest tax reductions are for the middle class . A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35 % tax cut . The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3 , and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified . The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent , and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate .\n2 .
