    "content": "After a combined 10 years leading the government , he finally had a Republican president in the White House , with a Republican House and Senate to boot . It should have been the perfect match for Netanyahu 's right-wing coalition .\nThe prime minister would be free of the condemnation of construction in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements that became routine under former President Barack Obama , the right wing believed . President Donald Trump would allow Israel to build and build freely .\nWithin 10 days of Trump 's inauguration , Israel approved plans for more than 6,000 housing units in settlements as well as the first brand-new settlement municipality in the West Bank in nearly two decades .\nHeaping praise upon Trump at their first news conference together in Washington , Netanyahu said : `` There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state . '' Vice President Mike Pence is expected to also receive a warm reception when he addresses the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) at its large annual conference in Washington , which begins on Sunday .\nAnd the settlement movement rejoiced at the new White House leadership .\n`` I think ( Trump ) loves Israel , '' said Chaim Silberstein , spokesman for the Beit El settlement outside of Ramallah . `` I think he loves the biblical heartland of Israel , which is here . '' Some even spoke in messianic terms .\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife , Sara , as they arrive at the White House in Washington , DC , on February 15 , 2017\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett , head of the right-wing Jewish Home party and one of the most outspoken Israeli opponents of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , declared after the elections , `` The era of a Palestinian state is over . ''\nBut for Netanyahu , the honeymoon period lasted less than two months .\nTrump quickly walked back his oft-repeated campaign promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , and he criticized Israeli settlements as `` not good '' for peace .\nAt their joint White House appearance , Trump told Netanyahu to `` hold back on settlements for a bit . '' Trump wanted a chance to conclude what he called `` the ultimate deal '' : peace between Israelis and Palestinians .\nOn Thursday , after two rounds of talks spanning the US and the Middle East , the White House put out a statement saying that the American delegation `` reiterated President Trump 's concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement , '' adding , `` The Israeli delegation made clear that Israel 's intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration . ''\nNetanyahu now finds himself walking a tight-rope between a new president interested in a peace deal and an empowered right-wing determined to sink the two-state solution once and for all . In the face of this political pressure and a corruption investigation , it is increasingly possible that the Israeli leader may soon have to face elections .\nEver the cautious politician , Netanyahu had previously warned his governing coalition -- which includes Jewish Home and Netanyahu 's own Likud Party -- not to celebrate too much over Trump 's victory . He even forbade his ministers , Bennett included , from speaking to Washington officials without his approval , especially about settlements and annexation .\nBut after Trump 's inauguration , Israel 's right-wing felt there was no reason to hold back . The pressure on Netanyahu from Jewish Home and even those within Likud kept growing .\nFor Netanyahu , building in the settlements is n't just a promise he 's made to the approximately 420,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank ; it is also about long-term political survival , as Netanyahu and Bennett battle for the same right-wing constituency .\nNetanyahu has boasted that there is no government that will be more pro-settlement than the current one , and he ca n't afford to be outflanked on the right by his own coalition partners . At the same time , no Israeli leader -- on the right or left -- would risk angering Israel 's primary international ally .\n`` I think we can say now what is clear is that if the right in Israel thought that Mr. Trump is going to join Mr. Bennett 's party , it made a very grave mistake , '' Yehuda Ben Meir , a principal research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies told CNN . `` As I think any intelligent person can realize , Donald Trump is President of the United States . The United States has interests throughout the world . ''\nBen Meir continued , `` To a certain degree , Mr. Netanyahu has really locked himself into this dilemma , and we will have to see how he maneuvers through it . ... It depends on what is the position of President Trump . It 's not clear yet . ''\nThe tension was evident in mid-March in Netanyahu 's first meeting with Jason Greenblatt , Trump 's special envoy for international negotiations .\nGreenblatt , who served as Trump 's business attorney before becoming an adviser on Israel , may have seemed likely to be in sync with the Israeli Prime Minister . Before the elections , he wrote an op-ed for CNN insisting that Trump would recognize Jerusalem as the eternal , undivided capital of Israel and would move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . Those moves , warned the Palestinian leadership that sees East Jerusalem as its capital in any future Palestinian state , would essentially sink the process of forging a two-state solution .\nIn a meeting that lasted more than five hours , Greenblatt and Netanyahu reaffirmed the strong bond between the United States and Israel , with the former emphasizing Trump 's commitment to Israel 's security . But the statement addressing the settlements issued Thursday made clear that the US is looking for Israel to rein in construction .\nSo far , the parties have not found a framework for settlement construction acceptable to Trump and Netanyahu . After marathon meetings between Greenblatt , Netanyahu Chief of Staff Yoav Horowitz and Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer , the two sides still had not finalized an agreement . Trump 's `` concerns regarding settlement activity '' remained . So did Netanyahu 's desire to keep building .\nOne day after Netanyahu 's first meeting with Greenblatt , Trump 's envoy met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah . According to a readout of that meeting , Abbas stressed the Palestinian commitment to a two-state solution , while Greenblatt emphasized Trump 's desire for peace through direct negotiations .\nThe statement mentioned the possibility of a meeting in Washington between Abbas and Trump -- which would only ratchet up the pressure on Netanyahu to make concessions if Abbas presents himself as a partner for peace , willing to compromise for the sake of an agreement .\nIsrael 's right , however , wants to move in the other direction . During Greenblatt 's visit earlier in the month , politicians from Jewish Home and Likud had planned to introduce a bill to annex Ma'ale Adumim , a West Bank settlement just outside Jerusalem .\nIsrael has never annexed any part of the West Bank it captured in the 1967 war outside of East Jerusalem . Israeli settlements there are illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this on historical and religious grounds .\n`` Trump is genuinely interested in making peace . He 's been very consistent about that . I think he sees it as a personal challenge , '' said Chemi Shalev , a senior columnist with Haaretz , an Israeli daily newspaper . `` And he had to get over bad relations with Gulf countries , especially Saudi Arabia , and part of that is that the Saudis have made it clear to him that if he 's thinking of creating ( a regional ) anti-Iranian bloc , at least part of that has to be a semblance of a peace process with the Palestinians . ''\nTo some degree , President Barack Obama 's deep opposition to settlements helped Netanyahu navigate the thorny politics of the issue . It gave him the political cover to satisfy the right wing with only small steps on settlements -- making the case that he could do not more -- so that he did n't face major blowback from the US , international community and Israeli center and left .\nTrump is making some signs that he 's no fan of settlements either , but the right does n't see his opposition as stiff enough to warrant Netanyahu caving in and therefore is unlikely to be satisfied with small steps . ( For one thing , both the President and his pick for ambassador to Israel have given money to the Beit El settlement 's schools . )\nThe current term of Israel 's government runs until late 2019 . Few think it will last that long .\nIn addition to the political pressure Netanyahu faces , he is under criminal investigation in a corruption probe , suspected of receiving gifts from overseas businessmen . So far , he has been questioned by police four times , though police and the attorney general 's office have been guarded with information about the investigation .\nNetanyahu has sworn the investigations will lead to nothing , as they did when he was investigated in his first term as prime minister in the late '90s . But an indictment would put political and public pressure on him to step down despite his promise not to do so . Under Israeli law , he has to step down only if he is convicted and if that conviction is upheld through the appeals process .\nAs the investigation inches along , election fever is in the air . Three parties have called for early primaries .\nNetanyahu 's former defense minister , Moshe Ya'alon , announced he has split off from the Likud to form his own party . Yair Lapid , head of the Yesh Atid centrist party and one of Netanyahu 's primary rivals , has been running even with Netanyahu 's party in recent polls . Right-wing Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel has promised to leave Netanyahu 's coalition if the premier agrees to any limitation on settlement construction .\n`` Even though ( the coalition ) does n't want elections , there 's a growing sense that elections may be around the corner in any case , and in that case the Jewish Home will press on with the annexation of Ma'ale Adumim and will attack whatever arrangements Netanyahu has with Trump , '' said Shalev . `` It 'll go from bad to worse from the point of view of the stability of the coalition . ''\nNetanyahu himself threatened elections one week ago , despite strenuous objections from his coalition and his own party . Critics have pointed out that calling an election would also , under Israeli law , freeze the criminal investigation of Netanyahu . It may also be a way of keeping the smaller parties in the coalition in line .\nIt is a sign of the instability in a government that was supposed to be reinforced by Trump 's victory , not undermined . Netanyahu finds himself trying to balance the demands of his own coalition with the unpredictable expectations of a president who is not the partner Israel 's right wing thought it was getting .",
