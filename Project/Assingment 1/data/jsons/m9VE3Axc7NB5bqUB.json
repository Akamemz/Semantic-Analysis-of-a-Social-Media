    "content": "This is a story about the swing voter . The voter who , days before the election , doesn \u2019 t know if she wants to vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 or , hell , maybe Jill Stein or Gary Johnson .\nYou 're going to hear a lot about these mythical middle-ground people in the runup to the election . You can just search `` swing voter '' to see how common this narrative is :\nThis is because many pundits think swing voters decide elections . They think swing voters \u2014 or `` floating voters '' \u2014 are large in number and just sitting in the middle , waiting to be convinced by one party or the other to vote for them . So this is the picture in their heads :\nBut increasingly , this picture is wrong . As the parties polarize , it \u2019 s becoming much easier to for Americans to choose sides , even if they don \u2019 t identify as Republican or Democrat . So when they go to vote , they act like partisans .\nBack when there were more voters who might change their minds , campaigns were based on persuasion , and persuasion pulls you toward the middle . But when everyone \u2019 s mind is already made up , that means the way to win an election is to rile up people on your own team .\nWe know swing voters are going extinct because of a political scientist named Corwin Smidt\nA few years ago , Smidt , who works at Michigan State University , was trying to reconcile two things .\nOne was that there were more and more people identifying as independents , rather than Democrats or Republicans .\nThat should 've meant that there were a huge number of people who were willing to change their minds , since they were n't partisan .\nBut Smidt also noticed that over this time period , the presidential election maps did n't change much . It was \u201c much more rigid . ''\nOne way to reconcile these two things was to believe that independents were no longer participating , which means there were fewer nonpartisan voters .\nBut Smidt had another question : Are these self-labeled nonpartisans actually willing to vote for Republicans one election and Democrats in another ?\nSo he decided to study historical surveys that asks Americans about how they voted . He came up with four groups for the respondents :\nHe did this for every year going back 50 years .\nWhat he found was simple , though shocking : Even though more and more people don \u2019 t align with a party , they still consistently behave like reliable partisans and repeatedly vote for the same party .\nMost voters look at where the parties stand on the issues , and then they pick one that best reflects their own views . But if you don \u2019 t pay enough attention to tell the parties apart , then you won \u2019 t know which party you agree with . That makes you more likely to swing between parties .\nSo if we redraw the picture at the top , it would look like this . Notice how similar the two sides look to her :\nAnd it used to be common for people with less political knowledge to switch the party they supported from election to election \u2014 whether or not they voted .\nBut over time , this party switching has become far less common :\nThis is because now even low-information voters can tell the two parties apart :\nEven low-information voters say there \u2019 s an important difference between Republicans and Democrats\nIn 1960 , both partisans and nonpartisans were much less likely to say there was a big difference between Republicans and Democrats .\nNow almost all strong partisans would say yes \u2014 and even half of nonpartisans would say yes .\nIn short , voters are more confident that they know exactly what they \u2019 re voting for when they look at the \u201c D \u201d or the \u201c R \u201d next to a candidate \u2019 s name \u2014 no matter how partisan they are .\nA modern-day person with low political awareness can tell the parties apart just as well as someone who had high awareness in 1968 :\nHow is it that swing voters can now tell the parties apart ? Polarization .\nIt 's not that the people have changed . Rather , it 's the parties .\nLet 's go back to the drawing at the top of the story . Here 's where we were in the 1950s , where a low-information voter would look at the parties and not be able to tell the difference .\nBut over the past 50 years , the two parties have evolved very distinct platforms .\nIn the 1968 election , neither Republican Richard Nixon nor Democrat Hubert Humphrey articulated clear views on what he would in Vietnam . `` This ambivalence and deliberate obfuscating can create opportunity to win voters over , '' Smidt said .\nBefore Ronald Reagan , the Republican Party did n't have an anti-abortion position .\nAt the 1996 State of the Union , Bill Clinton said , `` The era of big government is over . ''\nIt was a lot harder to pin down each party to specific issues , especially for those who were n't paying close attention . But now the party lines are clear on abortion , taxes , climate change , health care , same-sex marriage \u2014 the list goes on . That 's why when we look at how much Republicans and Democrats agree in the House and Senate , we see more and more polarization :\nYou could argue that voters clearly knowing which side they \u2019 re on is a good thing . But in the 1954 study `` Voting : A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign , '' political scientists argued that what we need from an electorate is diversity \u2014 in other words , we ca n't just have rigid voters with ideal views , but also detached voters with rational views . Those are the people who allow our political system to more efficiently get things done .\nAs Smidt writes , `` Even the 'least admirable ' voters enrich our democratic political system by providing it with the flexibility and indifference that it needs . ''\nIf everyone is a reliable partisan , then there is n't incentive to be in the middle ground . And we ca n't get things done .\nIf more and more voters are either on your side or the opponent \u2019 s side , that means winning elections is simple : You have to get your people more excited , and get the other side less excited .\nThis means that candidates have little incentive to talk to people in the middle \u2014 people who do n't make consistent partisan decisions in the voting booth .\nJust think about the 2016 election in this framework : Voters in Utah , who are traditionally Republican , do n't like Donald Trump . But because the party positions are so polarized , it 's too far a jump for them to support a Democrat like Hillary Clinton . So as Smidt points out , many would rather jump to a third party candidate .\nTrump was supposed to be the most nontraditional candidate in modern American politics \u2014 someone who was shaking up the electorate . But on November 8 , when you look at the election map , it 'll probably look a lot like past election maps . Maybe a few states will switch over , but most of America will likely have voted the same way .\nThe president-elect will have won on the backs of riled up partisans , and people would be swing voters \u2014 except they \u2019 re not because they picked a side long ago .\nClarification : I initially called Smidt \u2019 s research an experiment , but it \u2019 s more so a study of historical data , which I \u2019 ve clarified in the piece .",
