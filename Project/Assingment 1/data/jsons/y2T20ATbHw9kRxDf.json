    "content": "The deal demonstrated the pragmatism of Egypt \u2019 s new Islamist president , Mohamed Morsi , who balanced public support for Hamas with a determination to preserve the peace with Israel . But it was unclear whether the agreement would be a turning point or merely a lull in the conflict .\nThe cease-fire deal was reached only through a final American diplomatic push : Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton conferred for hours with Mr. Morsi and the United Nations secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , at the presidential palace here . Hanging over the talks was the Israeli shock at a Tel Aviv bus bombing \u2014 praised by Hamas \u2014 that recalled past Palestinian uprisings and raised fears of heavy Israeli retaliation . After false hopes the day before , Western and Egyptian diplomats said they had all but given up hope for a quick end to the violence .\nTellingly , neither Israel nor Hamas was represented in the final talks or the announcement , leaving it in the hands of a singular partnership between their proxies , the United States and Egypt .\nThere were immediate questions about the durability of the deal . Hamas , which controls Gaza , has in the past not fulfilled less formal cease-fires by failing to halt all missile fire into Israel by breakaway Palestinian militants .\nNeither side retreated from threats to resume the conflict if the deal fell through , and both said they had only reluctantly agreed under international pressure .
