    "content": "( CNN ) Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday proposed eliminating the student loan debts of tens of millions of Americans and making all public colleges tuition-free , staking out an ambitious stance on one of the central policy debates of the 2020 Democratic primary .\nStudent debt and college affordability have become a key dividing line in the Democratic race , between more progressive candidates who favor sweeping new tuition and student-loan benefits and others who support more incremental adjustments to the way Americans pay for education .\nWarren 's new plan would forgive $ 50,000 in student loans for Americans in households earning less than $ 100,000 a year . According to analysis provided by her campaign , that would provide immediate relief to more than 95 % of the 45 million Americans with student debt . The Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 contender is also calling for a drastic increase in federal spending on higher education that would make tuition and fees free for all students at two- and four-year public colleges and expand grants for lower-income and minority students to cover costs like housing , food , books and child care .\nThe campaign estimates that the plan would cost $ 1.25 trillion over 10 years .\nThe revenue from Warren 's wealth tax proposal -- a 2 % tax on wealth above $ 50 million and a 3 % tax on wealth above $ 1 billion -- would pay for her newest proposal , her campaign said . According to details shared by her campaign , the massive debt cancellation and free college plan additionally asks states to chip in to cover the cost of tuition and fees . Warren has also said her universal child care proposal would be paid for by her wealth tax .\nAsked about connecting the viability of her new proposal to another , Warren insisted that there is broad support for the idea of taxing the ultra-rich .\n`` For two cents on the dollar , we could pay for universal child care , universal pre-K , universal college and knock back the student loan debt burden for about 43 million Americans and still have nearly , just short , of $ 1 trillion leftover , '' Warren said in an interview with CNN . `` It tells you how badly out of whack our economy is right now . ''\nWarren -- a co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders ' 2017 legislation that would make four-year public colleges tuition-free for some students -- said her new plan is `` bigger '' and `` goes further '' than Sanders ' , who is also vying for the Democratic nomination .\n`` It covers more and it addresses both the access question of going to college and the problem of the debt burden for our students , '' she said .\nThe former college dropout and law professor described the proposal as one of the most `` personally important '' of her growing White House platform .\n`` I got married at 19 and I took a job answering phones and I thought that was going to be my whole life . And the fact that there was a commuter college about 45 minutes away that I could pay for on a part-time waitressing job -- you know , it opened a door , '' said Warren , who has made the story a fixture of her stump speech . `` It all started with that chance in college .

Hillary Clinton also ran on a tuition-free proposal for low-and middle-income students , and several states , including New York , Oregon , Tennessee and Rhode Island have recently implemented some form of a tuition-free plan . Public polls have shown broad support for tuition-free colleges and making higher education more affordable .\nBut Warren 's proposal of forgiving outstanding student debt goes a significant step further than previous Democratic policy plans .

Households that make less than $ 100,000 a year would get $ 50,000 in loan cancellation , with the amount of relief getting gradually smaller as income level goes up , with households that make more than $ 250,000 not eligible for any debt relief .\nAltogether , it would wipe out all student debt -- including both federal and private loans -- for more than 75 % of Americans with outstanding loans , according to analysis provided by Warren 's campaign .\nThe `` Universal Free College '' portion of Warren 's plan makes public college free for everyone , regardless of their finances . While Sanders ' 2015 proposal offered free tuition for everyone , a 2017 bill scaled back eligibility based on income -- language built on a compromise proposal agreed on between Sanders and Clinton during the 2016 election .\nWarren 's proposal also makes significant investments to help lower-income and minority students afford the non-tuition costs associated with attending college .
