Petraeus about the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , his recently disclosed extramarital affair and other issues \u2014 but their queries will have to wait for a later date .\nActing CIA Director Michael Morrell will testify Thursday in closed-door hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees instead of Mr. Petraeus , who resigned abruptly last week after admitting he had an extramarital affair .\nCongressional leaders said they want to know when the FBI uncovered Mr. Petraeus \u2018 affair with his biographer , Paula Broadwell , during its investigation of threatening emails to a woman close to the former CIA chief , whether national security was compromised , and why the FBI didn \u2019 t notify Congress sooner about the affair .\n\u201c The FBI has briefed me now . I actually wish we had been briefed a little bit earlier . \u2026 We received no advanced notice . It was like a lightning bolt , \u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , told \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\nA senior U.S. military official identified the second woman as Jill Kelley , 37 , who lives in Tampa , Fla. , and serves as the State Department \u2019 s liaison to the military \u2019 s Joint Special Operations Command , where work on secret drone missions and other duties are performed , The Associated Press reported .\nThe military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly , said Mrs. Kelley received harassing emails from Mrs. Broadwell , which led the FBI to examine her email account and eventually discover her relationship with Mr. Petraeus .\nA friend of Mrs. Kelley and Mr. Petraeus , who also spoke on the condition of anonymity , also said the two saw each other often , but the nature of their friendship was unclear , AP reported .\nOn Sunday night , Mrs. Kelley and her husband , Scott , issued a statement saying their family has \u201c been friends with Gen. Petraeus and his family for more than five years . We respect his and his family \u2019 s privacy and want the same for us and our three children . \u201d\nMr. Petraeus , who turned 60 on Wednesday , tendered his resignation Thursday to President Obama , and informed CIA employees of his action \u2014 and his affair \u2014 on Friday .\nHe resigned amid congressional scrutiny of the Obama administration \u2019 s response to the assault on the U.S. Consulate , in which U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States .\nIntelligence committee leaders will question Mr. Morrell and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce about Mr. Petraeus \u2018 affair during meetings Wednesday , a day before the closed-door hearing at which Mr. Petraeus originally was scheduled to appear .\nCongressional leaders indicated that they still might call on Mr. Petraeus to testify eventually .\n\u201c I would not rule out Gen. Petraeus being called to testify . That still could happen at some point in time , \u201d Sen. Saxby Chambliss , Georgia Republican and vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see how in the world you can find out what happened in Benghazi before , during and after the attack if Gen. Petraeus doesn \u2019 t testify , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said on CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\nOne former senior congressional staffer , who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of current employers , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Mr. Petraeus would be \u201c duty-bound \u201d to testify , even as a private citizen .\n\u201c He is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice . He could be asked to testify as a former senior official , and if he refuses \u2014 which I don \u2019 t think he would \u2014 he could be subpoenaed , \u201d said the staffer , who is the director of a House subcommittee .\nMr. Chambliss said that , in the meantime , it is \u201c fine \u201d for Mr. Morrell to testify in Mr. Petraeus \u2018 place at Thursday \u2019 s classified hearing , along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Matthew Olson , the head of the National Counterterrorism Center .\nMr. Morrell \u201c certainly was there when all the decisions were made relative to Benghazi , \u201d the senator said .\nMrs. Feinstein also ruled out any connection between Mr. Petraeus \u2018 resignation and its postelection disclosure , and political fallout from the Benghazi incident . For several days after the attack , administration officials said it emerged from spontaneous protests , not terrorists .\nThere was \u201c absolutely not \u201d any connection to Benghazi , Mrs. Feinstein said . \u201c And , I think if you really think this thing out , you will \u2014 everybody will come to that same conclusion . \u201d\nBut Rep.
