Indiana said it will end up paying unemployment benefits to the illegal immigrants . And in Texas , officials said they \u2019 ll have to hire more than 100 new employees to process hundreds of thousands of driver \u2019 s license applications , with state taxpayers shelling out more than $ 130 per applicant .\n\u201c The states will lose money , \u201d Texas , which is leading the lawsuit , told Judge Andrew Hanen in legal papers .\nJudge Hanen , who sits in Brownsville , Texas , will hear oral arguments in the case Thursday , with the fate of Mr. Obama \u2019 s most ambitious executive action to date riding on the outcome .\nThe case turns on two key factors : first , whether Texas and the 24 other states that have joined the lawsuit can show they or their residents stand to suffer from the president \u2019 s policies ; and second , whether Mr. Obama \u2019 s actions go beyond case-by-case discretion and tread on Congress \u2018 power to write laws and set policy .\nTexas and its fellow states argue the licenses and other benefits prove they will suffer , which means they have \u201c standing \u201d to sue in court .\nThey also painted a compelling picture of the program as a rubber-stamp rather than the careful case-by-case decisions the Obama administration claims .\nTexas says a 95 percent approval rate for applicants for the existing amnesty for so-called Dreamers shows the program is a rubber stamp . The state even filed an affidavit to that effect from Kenneth Palinkas , head of the labor union of officers who process the applications .\n\u201c Leadership has intentionally stopped proper screening and enforcement and , in so doing , it has guaranteed that applications will be rubber-stamped for approval , a practice that virtually guarantees widespread fraud and places public safety at risk , \u201d Mr. Palinkas said .\nTexas also says the administration has repeatedly hurt its own case with the way it \u2019 s gone about attacking states that have cracked down on illegal immigration , while trying to make its own amnesty programs as generous as possible .\nIn one instance , the administration argues that states don \u2019 t have to issue driver \u2019 s licenses to illegal immigrants \u2014 thus saying there \u2019 s no financial burden to states from the amnesty .

Circuit Court of Appeals has sided with the administration , meaning that all of the states under its jurisdiction , including three of the plaintiff states in the Texas case , do not have a choice .\nIn another example , Texas submitted the declaration of a labor economist who said that because the illegal immigrants would become legal workers but still aren \u2019 t eligible for Obamacare , they are cheaper to hire for some businesses .
