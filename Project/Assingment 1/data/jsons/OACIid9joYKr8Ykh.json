In the summer of 2013 , he moved from Texas to Tennessee so his family could be closer to his wife \u2019 s parents . But when his new job evaporated with a layoff after just four months , Mr. Parkes was in trouble : unemployed in a difficult job market , edging toward age 50 , and with two kids moving through school .\nNot least among his challenges : He was still a newcomer to the Nashville area , with few friends or connections to turn to for support . \u201c I was basically terrified , because I didn \u2019 t know anyone here , \u201d he says .\nEven with his wife working in youth ministry , the year that followed was one of emotional turmoil . Parkes tried it all . Temp work . Networking with other parents at his kids \u2019 school . Contacting former employers . Mining online job boards . Each week , more r\u00e9sum\u00e9s went out into the void .\nThen this past fall , something changed . First came a small regional bank that actually wanted to interview him . Not long after came a call from the very bank that had laid him off . It was starting a new flood insurance underwriting division and hired Parkes to be part of the team .\nThe job means new confidence and financial security for Parkes and his family . It also represents a larger story of employment revival in the US economy .\nToday \u2019 s US job market is healthier than you might realize . True , the recovery is incomplete . Even a good job market today won \u2019 t mean conditions are easy for US workers .\nYet the progress is real . And crucially , it \u2019 s helping to address one of the defining features of the Great Recession and its aftermath : the large number of people who are long-term unemployed and in many cases at risk of dropping out of the workforce altogether .\nAn improved job climate has , more broadly , revived economic spirits across America . For the first time since the Great Recession officially ended some 5-1/2 years ago , Gallup and CNN polls find a majority of Americans having a positive view of the economy .\nLast year saw the strongest US employment growth since 1999 , and the official US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.7 percent of the labor force as of January , down from 6.6 percent a year before .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly good news that payroll growth has eliminated a lot of the employment gap that resulted from the recession , \u201d says Andrew Levin , who is joining the economics faculty of Dartmouth College . \u201c But at the current pace of job creation , another 18 months to two years will probably be needed to reach full employment . \u201d\nIn fact , even as the undeniable gains give the United States lower joblessness than many European nations , the set of remaining challenges is also clear :\n\u2022 Middle-class incomes had been stagnating and inequality widening even before the recession . Those trends have now become central political questions , gaining attention from Republican and Democratic leaders alike in the run-up to a presidential election in 2016 .\n\u2022 From robots to smart phones , technology has opened new opportunities for consumers but is also disrupting traditional occupations . Economist Tyler Cowen distilled the worry in a 2013 book , \u201c Average Is Over , \u201d forecasting a future in which an educated elite pulls increasingly far ahead of everyone else .\n\u2022 As the US emerges from the most protracted jobs bust since the Great Depression , a historically high number of working-age civilians are still without work or underemployed . Some have part-time jobs rather than the full-time ones they hope for . Some have grown so discouraged that they \u2019 ve stopped even looking for work .\nOne key worry is that many of the recession-sidelined Americans have become so detached from the workforce \u2013 losing skills , connections , marketability \u2013 that they may never work again .\nReviving the rate of labor force participation ( the share of US adults who are working or wanting to work ) may be a vital measure of whether America is really nearing \u201c full employment. \u201d That \u2019 s why , at this point , a month in which the unemployment rate edges up isn \u2019 t necessarily a bad thing \u2013 if it \u2019 s a sign of more people being drawn into the job hunt .\nEconomist Stephen Rose of George Washington University sees the challenges , but he also cautions against buying into a view of long-term pessimism . Time and again , he says , forecasts of a grim future have emerged in times of economic distress , technological change , or global competition \u2013 and then been proved wrong .\nAlready , in at least a few industries , a shortage of workers is starting to surface . Tim Bowe , chief executive of a product-development firm based near Boston , says the college- and graduate-degree scientists he \u2019 s looking to hire are hard to find .\n\u201c The market is not even tightening , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s tight . \u201d\nThe company , called Foliage , hopes to grow its 600-person US workforce by 20 percent this year as it brings technology solutions to clients in industries from cars to industrial equipment .\nEven beyond strong fields like math and sciences , employers have been adding jobs lately across a broad range of industries . The new positions include many low-paid ones in restaurants and retail shops . But many are also in professional services , sales , and skilled factory work . Fully 1 in 10 new jobs over the past year has come in construction , a welcome revival for an industry that was hit especially hard by the recession .\nThe job gains have actually been coming since the end of 2010 \u2013 and slower than anyone wished . But last year saw a pickup in the pace , a shift toward the better in public opinion about the economy , and forecasts of continued job creation in 2015 .\nEven states such as Michigan and Ohio have seen high unemployment rates plummet , in part because of a revival of automotive and other manufacturing . And in 28 states , led by many west of the Mississippi , employment is now back above 2007 levels .\nYoung people between 16 and 24 years old , actually , have been the age group whose connections to work have most frayed since 2008 . Their rate of participation in the labor force took a drop after the recession that was twice as big as the drop for workers ages 25 to 34 or ages 45 to 54 .\nNow that is changing . Rashid Nelson , a senior at Boston University , says he \u2019 s seen the job outlook improving steadily each year he \u2019 s been in college . And now he knows he has a job waiting , as an account manager for AT & T , selling telecommunication technologies to both small and large businesses .\n\u201c I just wanted to put myself in a good position , \u201d he says of his intensive job hunt last fall . \u201c I didn \u2019 t want to be that one student who graduated and didn \u2019 t know what he was doing . \u201d\nThat focus , not just an improved job market , contributed to his finding a position . He majored in an area that \u2019 s in demand ( marketing ) , planned carefully ( leaving his Fridays clear of classes for potential travel for job interviews ) , and kept sending out applications during fall semester .\nToday , as a student ambassador for Boston University \u2019 s Center for Career Development , he \u2019 s urging peers to do similar planning .\nOlder workers , too , are glad to see an improving employment climate . Sam Jarman of San Diego went through a long stint of unemployment \u2013 twice . Working in the mortgage industry , an epicenter of the financial crisis , he lost one job in 2008 . He found another in 2009 , making loan modifications for people at risk of foreclosure .\nIt was a high-level job ( managing other managers on the team ) but his job security was inversely related to the health of the economy . By early last year he was laid off again .\nThe business of making regular home loans was picking up , but he was 51 years old and says no one would hire him . \u201c They said , \u2018 You \u2019 ve been out of the origination side for five years and a lot has changed . We want to hire someone who has more recent experience . \u2019 \u201d\nCall it wisdom or desperation , Mr. Jarman began widening his efforts . \u201c I prayed , I networked , I was ready to take anything . I looked in health care , at Petco , Jack in the Box , \u201d he says . \u201c For the first time in 27 years , I considered leaving California because there were no jobs here . \u201d\nBut in October he landed one , in the lending industry and at a local credit union . He took a 25 percent pay cut and is one step down from his prior managerial level , but he \u2019 s glad to be there . \u201c I like it . There are good people here , and [ the company ] isn \u2019 t going to leave San Diego , \u201d he says . \u201c I feel more secure . \u201d\nAs of January , the Bureau of Labor Statistics still counts 2.8 million Americans as unemployed for more than half a year and still looking for work . Even when people do move forward , it \u2019 s not unusual for the process to be start-and-stop \u2013 with new jobs that don \u2019 t last very long .\nThe positive thing is simply this : From blue-collar workers to people like Jarman , more and more jobless workers are finding their way back to work .\nOne day last fall , Lidia Sotomayor was doing a dress rehearsal for that pivotal few minutes that could make or break her future \u2013 a job interview .\nHer mock interviewer , a woman from a group called Platform to Employment , was in effect the drill sergeant in a boot camp for the long-term unemployed .
