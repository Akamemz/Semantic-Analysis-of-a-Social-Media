Sure , they won battles here and there . But even most of those victories turned into losses through court decisions anyway .\nNow we \u2019 re in the midst of the ultimate battle in the culture war \u2013 the battle for the First Amendment \u2013 and if Republicans don \u2019 t recognize this is a war and fight like their existence depends on victory , nothing else will matter .\nIf you had told me five years ago that , in 2017 , we \u2019 d be debating the nature of free speech and whether American citizens could be blocked from speaking on the campus of a public university because of their politics , I would \u2019 ve laughed in your face . But then , I would have had the same reaction if you had told me Donald Trump would be president in 2017 , so clearly nothing is impossible .\nIt \u2019 s easy to dismiss the violent mobs in Berkeley , Portland , Washington , D.C. , and everywhere else as a \u201c fringe element \u201d because there are relatively few of them and their actions are fringe . But the fringe of the political left is the tail wagging the progressive dog called the Democratic Party .\nThe most popular Democrat in the party is a slouching , cranky , unkempt septuagenarian who publicly and proudly refuses to call himself a Democrat .
