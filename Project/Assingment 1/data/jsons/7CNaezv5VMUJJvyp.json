    "content": "On Tuesday , the Dhillon Law Group , where I serve as an election law attorney , filed a lawsuit against the state of California . This lawsuit alleges that California is violating federal law by not ensuring that only citizens are on the state \u2019 s voting rolls . Three California voters brought this lawsuit : Roxanne Hoge , Ali Mazarei , and Corrin Rankin . Both Hoge and Mazarei are legal immigrants who earned the privilege to vote by becoming citizens of the United States .\nIn 1993 , a Democrat-controlled Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the National Voter Registration Act ( NVRA ) . This law mandated that states create more options for individuals to register to vote . This law also placed restrictions on the states on how they were to maintain their voter rolls . Under the NVRA , the state has a duty to regularly maintain the voter rolls by removing those individuals who had died or moved away .\nThe NVRA also requires a state \u2019 s secretary of state to determine the eligibility of each applicant before placing him or her on its voter rolls . Eligibility throughout the NVRA means that there is citizenship . Thus , the NVRA requires the states to ensure that someone is a citizen prior to placing him or her on the voter rolls .\nState records show that before the California secretary of state \u2019 s office places an applicant on the voter rolls , it checks with state administrative records to ensure the individual is not a felon and that the voter application is not a duplicate . The state admits that it does not review state administrative records to determine if an applicant is a citizen of the United States . If California does not even bother to check the citizenship status of voter applicants , it can continue to claim to the media that there is no evidence of non-citizens being placed on its voter rolls .\nLast year , the California secretary of state admitted he had no idea how many non-citizens were on the voter rolls . Earlier this year , a state audit was released that showed non-citizens were not only registered to vote , but had voted in California elections . These two news stories made it clear that California did not use state administrative records to ensure that only citizens were being registered to vote . Rather than follow federal law and make a determination of citizenship before placing an applicant on the voter rolls , the state simply waits for a scandal to break before responding by removing a non-citizen from its voter rolls . This is improper .\nThe California secretary of state has claimed that there is no state administrative record that tracks citizenship of Californians . This is clearly not true , since a state audit was able to determine that non-citizens were not only on the voter rolls but had also actually voted . Contrary to what the secretary of state wants the media to believe , there are multiple state administrative records that contain the citizenship status of voters . Every applicant for a state driver \u2019 s license is required to provide proof of identity . These proof-of-identity documents include citizenship status . If an individual can not prove that he/she is lawfully a United States citizens , a driver \u2019 s license is still doled out but that individual is supposedly not simultaneously also registered to vote .\nBy bringing this lawsuit , the plaintiffs desire to hold the secretary of state \u2019 s feet to the fire . It is time that California be required to follow federal law and ensure that everyone who is on the voter rolls is actually eligible to vote . This lawsuit is necessary because California has a bad habit of thumbing its nose at federal election laws and dragging its feet as long as possible .
