Dianne Feinstein \u2019 s bid for a fifth term \u2014 for the second time this year .\nThe state party \u2019 s executive committee voted Saturday to endorse progressive state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n in the general election , signaling what many fear will be a divisive Democrat-on-Democrat battle going toward to the fall in California , where the party hoped to put the focus on a host of crucial congressional races that could determine control of the House of Representatives .\nThe endorsement delivers a lifeline to de Le\u00f3n \u2019 s struggling campaign \u2014 and the party \u2019 s imprimatur , which is accompanied by valuable access to slate cards , email lists and voter outreach machinery that will allow him to reach an estimated 2 million Democratic voters . And he could also get an infusion of federal campaign cash shared with the party , party officials said .\nFeinstein , who was also snubbed in February at the annual state convention where party activists declined to endorse her bid for reelection , had pleaded for party unity prior to Saturday \u2019 s vote . She asked the executive committee of the California Democrats , the nation \u2019 s largest state Democratic Party , to choose \u201c no endorsement \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 what many saw as a strategic defense to head off an aggressive challenge for the party \u2019 s endorsement by de Le\u00f3n .\nAnd in an effort to frame the endorsement clash in the context of the national political landscape , the senator \u2019 s team circulated a \u201c no-endorsement \u201d plea signed by a half-dozen Democrats whose campaigns in contested California districts are a linchpin of the national party \u2019 s strategy to retake the House .\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State .

You can unsubscribe at any time .\nThe final vote gave de Le\u00f3n 217 votes , or 65 percent \u2014 beating the 60 percent required threshold \u2014 versus 94 votes , or 28 percent , for the \u201c no endorsement \u201d urged by Feinstein , and 22 votes , or 7 percent , for the senator herself .\nThe Senate contest pits two contrasting pols : Feinstein \u2014 at 85 , the oldest member of the Senate \u2014 and De Le\u00f3n , 51 , a former state Senate president pro tem and son of a single immigrant mother . She is a centrist long at odds with her state party \u2019 s leftist activist grass roots , while he is a progressive who has called for new \u201c bold leadership \u201d from Democrats unafraid of confronting President Donald Trump head-on .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s always good to have younger generations rise up and assume positions of leadership , \u2019 \u2019 de Le\u00f3n told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday .\nHis fight , he said , was not about \u201c a gender issue ... it \u2019 s not an age issue. \u2019 \u2019 Pointing to progressive icons Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , de Le\u00f3n said , \u201c it \u2019 s about the right values . \u201d\nThe weekend \u2019 s nail-biter over the party \u2019 s Senate general election endorsement underscored the depths of the bitter divisions still lingering from the 2016 battles between more progressive backers of Sanders \u2019 presidential bid and the more centrist faction of Hillary Clinton supporters in the nation \u2019 s most populous state .\nAlthough the endorsement involved just a small circle of the most activist voters \u2014 a 313-member executive committee in a party that represents 8.4 million voters \u2014 many Democratic insiders said it carried potentially dangerous implications for the party beyond the state \u2019 s borders .\nNot only did the internal battle threaten to extend the rift among Democrats in California \u2014 a traditional mother lode of campaign contributions \u2014 many Democratic leaders , including former state chair Art Torres , worried about the prospect of a circular firing squad .\n\u201c We have the opportunity to change the nature and the control of the House , \u2019 \u2019 said Torres , a Feinstein backer , adding that a de Leon endorsement threatened that Democrats \u201c won \u2019 t have enough federal money to put into those congressional campaigns . \u2019 \u2019\n\u201c Federal money is the hardest to raise , \u201d he said , \u201c and if the party is going to spend money on a U.S. Senate campaign \u2014 why do it ? \u201d\nFor de Le\u00f3n \u2019 s campaign , snagging the party \u2019 s endorsement was widely seen as his last shot at making a serious run at Feinstein . California \u2019 s senior senator pummeled him by 32 percentage points in the June all-party primary , winning more than 70 percent of the Democratic vote in a contest in which 32 candidates competed .\nShe has also dramatically outraised him : Feinstein reported $ 10.3 million cash on hand at the end of March , compared with $ 672,330 for de Le\u00f3n , according to campaign finance reports .\nBut de Le\u00f3n has gained traction among the party \u2019 s far left as the author of the controversial SB54 , the California Values Act , also known as the \u201c sanctuary state \u201d law . The legislation , aimed at curtailing the cooperation of local law enforcement with federal immigration officials , was recently largely upheld by a federal judge \u2019 s ruling .\nDe Leon has also called for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and impeaching Trump \u2014 a position that is shared by his friend , wealthy Democratic activist Tom Steyer .\nIn making the rounds this weekend in caucus meetings at Oakland \u2019 s Marriott Hotel , Feinstein repeatedly reminded Democrats of her seniority in Washington , her legislative leadership on issues like the assault weapons ban , and of what she vowed will be her pivotal role as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 which will weigh Trump \u2019 s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court .\nFeinstein on Saturday downplayed the symbolism of a de Le\u00f3n endorsement and her difficulty with the party \u2019 s grass roots , insisting it would have no effect on her campaign . \u201c This was not a close primary election , and there were 32 people on the ballot , \u2019 \u2019 she said of the June contest . \u201c I take nothing for granted ... we work hard . \u201d\n\u201c I think people understand I \u2019 m now ranking on Judiciary , going into one of the biggest moments that this party has \u2014 the decisive Supreme Court justice , \u2019 \u2019 she said . \u201c This is a very big deal because this affects the life of every American going forward .
