    "content": "Two events from the last two days stand out . The first came Monday night with President Trump \u2019 s forceful yet compassionate speech at the swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court .\nThe president opened with an extraordinary apology on behalf of the country to Kav\u00adanaugh and his family \u201c for the terrible pain and suffering \u201d they endured during the historically brutal confirmation process . He said the unfounded allegations violated fairness and \u201c the presumption of innocence . \u201d\nTrump also tenderly addressed Kavanaugh \u2019 s young daughters , telling them \u201c your father is a great man , a man of decency , character , kindness and courage . \u201d\nThe event was something of a spike-the-football moment in front of a cheering White House audience and as such was a clever piece of stagecraft , where Republican Sens . Mitch McConnell , Charles Grassley , Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins were saluted .\nBut the ceremony was much more than mere boosterism . With the eight other Supremes sitting in the front row , Trump aimed to restore dignity to the judiciary at a time when the dirtiest tricks of politics have buried the court in a mountain of mud .\nThe president is right to worry that the character-assassination attempt on Kavanaugh may turn out to be a seminal moment in American political and cultural history . The ideas that the court is just another political branch and that the presumption of innocence no longer applies if you are on the other team represent a seismic shift in how we look at each other and the nation as a whole .\nIf those ideas stick , we are in more trouble than we can imagine .\nAnd while Trump has at times unnecessarily contributed to the rancor , he was terrific Monday in trying to repair what Senate Democrats and their media handmaidens tried to destroy .\n\u201c You can not be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for , what you care about , \u201d Clinton told CNN . \u201c That \u2019 s why I believe , if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate , that \u2019 s when civility can start again . But until then , the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength . \u201d\nThere you have it \u2014 a declaration of war and a license for violence . Where is the media outrage ?\nClinton knows we are already in the danger zone when it comes to the political temperature . Her comments , then , are as reckless as bringing a can of gasoline to a bonfire .\nShe \u2019 s stoking trouble to gain a foothold in the 2020 race \u2014 and damn the consequences .\nHer claim that civility can return when Dems have power is an admission that the ends justify the means .\nThen again , she never fails to disappoint . As I wrote Sunday , she has spent the last two years casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Trump presidency because the election didn \u2019 t go her way . That makes her guilty of the very thing she found \u201c horrifying \u201d when Trump suggested he might not abide by the results if he thought they were rigged .\n\u201c He is denigrating \u2014 he is talking down our democracy . And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position , \u201d she said in their final debate , in October 2016 .\nShe added , \u201c That is not the way our democracy works . \u201d\nBut it does work exactly that way when Democrats are denied what they feel entitled to . They should be careful what they wish for .\nFor if the Kavanaugh experience revealed anything , it is that Trump \u2019 s GOP knows how to fight back and win . It is hard to imagine that Kavanaugh would have survived such an onslaught under any other \u00adrecent Republican candidate or president .\nThere were so many reasons , and so much media pressure , that it would not have been surprising if a bloc of senators called the allegations a \u201c distraction \u201d and waved a white flag . They didn \u2019 t because Trump and Kavanaugh didn \u2019 t back down .\nStill , there is danger when two sides both think they can outlast the other . Responding to my concern that America might be sleepwalking into a second civil war , a number of readers agreed .
