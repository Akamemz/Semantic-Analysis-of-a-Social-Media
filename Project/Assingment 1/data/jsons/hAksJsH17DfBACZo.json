    "content": "Friday morning , multiple news outlets reported some disturbing news : One of the San Bernardino shooters , 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik , apparently pledged allegiance to ISIS in a Facebook post before the shooting .\nThese reports cite unnamed federal law enforcement officials , so it 's important to exercise caution about their veracity at this point . And even if they do turn out to be true , it 's important to be cautious about what they mean : The fact that a shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS does not mean ISIS planned the attack . Nor does it necessarily mean that ISIS is the reason the attack happened .\nWhat follows is a brief guide to what we know about the shooters ' ISIS links \u2014 and what that tells us about the shootings themselves .\nBefore Friday , the evidence linking Malik and her husband/fellow shooter , Syed Rizwan Farook to Islamist extremism had been sketchy at best . As the Soufan Group , a private consulting firm that studies terrorism , explains , their stockpile of ammunition and bombs matches the pattern of terrorist groups \u2014 but the fact that Farook used to work in the same government department as the targets suggested a more personal motive .\nBut today 's reports , from the New York Times and the Associated Press , are the best evidence yet that the shooting was in some way linked to ISIS .\nBoth pieces cited anonymous US law enforcement officials saying that Malik had posted a now-deleted pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on her personal Facebook page . The reports did n't disclose how federal authorities found it , though we know that they had been conducting an extensive investigation into the now-deceased shooters ' electronic histories .\nAs the New York Times piece notes , `` In the days leading up to the shooting , the couple in San Bernardino took several steps to delete their electronic information , in an apparent effort to cover their tracks , officials said . Those efforts have led authorities to believe that the shooting was premeditated . ''\nISIS asks people committing terrorist attacks in its name for such pledges \u2014 called `` bayat '' in jihadi parlance \u2014 before the attack . As they explain in the most recent issue of their English-language magazine , Dabiq :\nLet him record his will , renew his bayat , carry the Khilfah banner , and strike the crusaders and their pagan and apostate allies wherever he can find them , even if he is alone .\n`` This MAY be what Tashfeen Malik did , '' Thomas Joscelyn , a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , tweeted . `` Record her bayat ( allegiance ) for death . ''\nEmphasis on `` may '' there : `` [ I ] have n't seen her recording , so do n't know for sure , '' Joscelyn concluded . More broadly , anonymous comments by federal officials to newspapers are n't definitive proof . So while Friday 's reports are the strongest evidence yet of an ISIS link , we still can not be certain that Malik and Farook were jihadis .

Random individuals inspired by ISIS are , fundamentally , less scary than an ISIS that 's centrally planning and launching attacks from a continent away . ISIS has a lot more money at its command , and far more experience , than individual attackers . That means it could pull off bigger attacks .\nThis became a major conversation topic after November 's Paris attacks , as it was n't obvious whether those attacks were planned by ISIS or inspired by the group ( the evidence now suggests at least some central planning ) . I asked Will McCants , the director of the Brookings Institution 's Project on US Relations With the Islamic World and the author of The ISIS Apocalypse , about it just after those attacks .

''\nThat said , it 's plenty scary if the San Bernardino attacks were merely inspired by ISIS .
