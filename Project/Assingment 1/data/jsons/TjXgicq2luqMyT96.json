    "content": "After Todd Akin uttered the fateful words that destroyed his Senate campaign in August of last year , everyone in the GOP wanted a tug at the rope as they tied him to the train tracks . Almost every major figure in the party condemned him . Many asked him to step aside and allow someone else to run as the GOP 's Missouri candidate .\nThe Republican half of the `` legitimate rape '' pile-on was a desperate , but ultimately failed attempt to portray Akin 's comments about rape as an unfortunate case of bad-appleism . Much better to attack him for suggesting that some rapes might actually be righteous ( which he did n't do ) than for clumsily expressing what many Republicans genuinely ( and wrongly ) believe : that some rapes are less morally reprehensible than others , and that when a man perpetrates a so-called `` forcible '' rape , it wo n't result in a pregnancy .\nThat belief system did n't disappear just because Republicans blackballed Akin . And the fact that religious Republicans learned from Akin 's experience that they 're better off keeping their mouths shut about a whole host of issues does n't mean that the GOP 's latent Akinism wo n't flare up again .\nIn fact , it inevitably will . And the Supreme Court 's coming consideration of the Affordable Care Act 's contraception requirement almost guarantees that some prominent conservative will break out with a case of the Akins before the 2014 election .\nWhile obviously distinct from the issue of whether conservatives think abortion should be legal in cases of rape , the ACA 's requirement that health insurance , including employer sponsored insurance , cover contraception has already demonstrated its power to unmask the right 's unpopular beliefs about birth control pills and female sexuality in general .\nJust over a year and a half ago , conservatives believed they could put Democrats on the defensive by framing their opposition to the contraception coverage guarantee as a morally neutral stand for the religious liberties of employers . But when the Obama administration extended ministerial protections to a wider range of religious organizations , conservatives revealed their true objection : they , like Rush Limbaugh , view many women who use birth control as `` sluts '' and do not want to subsidize their `` slut medicine .

Conservatives are again framing the debate around anything other than what 's really at its heart : whether equalizing access to contraception is a worthy objective ; what criteria should society use to determine what counts as preventive care , and whether it should be publicly financed .\nInstead it 's about religious liberty . It 's about a corrupt Democratic payoff to pharmaceutical companies .\nBut when you interrogate these objections , you end up back at the same old morality play .\nStart with the premise that all employers , including conservative Christian employers , are n't `` providing '' health care coverage .

One way to look at what the Affordable Care Act does is to say it gives most employers few options other than to provide insurance that covers birth control pills ( and other preventive care ) , even if the proprietors are morally opposed to oral contraception . That 's true . And it 's appropriate in my view . But I think a better way to look at it is to say the Affordable Care Act imposes a variety of further conditions on that big tax break . If employers want to keep it , they need to accept that the plans they offer will cover contraception .

But you can only insist on both if your main goal is to limit access to immoral sex pills , rather than to protect the religious liberty of the proprietor .\nObviously it 's no small practical thing for a business like Hobby Lobby to up and drop employee health benefits . It would put the company at a big competitive disadvantage in the labor market ( though the ACA mitigates that ) and the company would eventually owe sizable penalties to the government for failing to provide coverage ( thanks again to the ACA ) .\nBut you ca n't wish away this option , particularly if the moral principle is truly cardinal .
