Weapons Sales\nThe Trump administration is in discussions to end a decades-old practice of informally notifying Congress of major arms sales to foreign countries , in a move that reflects mounting tensions between the administration and Capitol Hill , officials and congressional aides tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe proposal comes amid mounting frustration from senior administration officials over informal holds from lawmakers on arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , two close U.S. partners in the Middle East . Lawmakers have tried to block weapons sales to these countries over concerns about human rights issues and the prospect of civilian casualties , particularly with the Saudi-led coalition \u2019 s war against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen .\nThe proposal sets the stage for another potential showdown between the Trump administration and lawmakers . It comes amid broader debates on Capitol Hill over the president \u2019 s ability to wage war without prior congressional approval\u2014centered on U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition in Yemen\u2014and an ongoing congressional investigation into Trump \u2019 s firing of the State Department inspector general , who was probing the administration \u2019 s emergency arms sale to Saudi Arabia last year .\nIf the administration moves forward with the plan , officials and congressional aides said , it would still send formal notifications to Congress for review , giving lawmakers a legal avenue to block sales in a 30-day window of time by passing a joint resolution to oppose the arms sales . ( For close U.S. allies such as NATO members , Israel , Japan , or Australia , that window is 15 days . ) But it would eliminate a practice dating back to the 1970s of informally notifying Congress of planned arms sales well in advance , so that lawmakers and congressional staffers , the State Department , and Pentagon officials can hash out concerns and disagreements about such sales behind closed doors .\n\u201c Putting politics aside for a moment , both sides have a bone to pick , \u201d said Bilal Saab , a scholar at the Middle East Institute and former Pentagon official . \u201c Congress doesn \u2019 t want to be boxed in with pre-cooked arms sales cases and the executive branch is sick and tired of holds that sometimes are made by [ congressional ] staffers \u2026 and have adverse effects on \u2588\u2588\u2588 and relationships with partners . \u201d\nThe United States views foreign military sales as an important diplomatic tool beyond their military value , providing an avenue to deepen ties with foreign governments around the world . President Donald Trump has also cast his efforts to boost U.S. arms sales abroad as a domestic economic boon , claiming at different points that arms sales to Saudi Arabia created anywhere from 450,000 to over \u201c a million \u201d jobs . ( An independent study from the Center for International Policy , a think tank , released in May estimated the actual total to be 20,000 to 40,000 jobs . )\nWhile congressional aides were not surprised by the proposed move , which they said the Trump administration has been considering as far back as two years , a decision to end the informal consultation would be seen as a major slight to Capitol Hill \u2019 s oversight authority .\n\u201c That would be viewed as going nuclear , \u201d said Juan Pach\u00f3n , the communications director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2019 s top Democrat , Sen. Bob Menendez .\nCurrent and former officials familiar with the matter say Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has grown frustrated over lengthy informal congressional holds on arms sales he sees as important for U.S. national security and would support this plan . Lower-ranking officials in the State Department and Office of the Secretary of Defense oppose the plan , these officials say , believing that it will worsen relations between the administration and Congress , and it could prompt lawmakers to enact new laws that would give them greater powers in approving arms sales .\nWhen approached for comment , the Pentagon referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the State Department . The State Department declined to comment .\nSome former U.S. officials are concerned doing away with the informal review would allow more American weapons to flood into the Gulf without proper checks and balances .\n\u201c I \u2019 m concerned that this could facilitate the sale of weapons under less than ideal circumstances and could lead to an almost lackadaisical approach to selling weapons with destructive power around the world , \u201d said Andrew Miller , a former National Security Council director during the Obama administration and now deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy . \u201c They \u2019 re determined to continue flooding the Gulf with weapons . \u201d\nOther current and former officials point out that there are additional avenues for Congress to get advance notice about arms sales , including in classified briefings with administration officials and the so-called Javits Report , a State Department report issued to Congress annually that lists expected sales for the year .\nSaab , of the Middle East Institute , said there are other opportunities for the administration and Congress to find compromise in their growing disagreements about foreign arms sales . One compromise is to keep the 30-day peer review process but both sides commit to resolving mutual issues and grievances within that period with no holds afterwards , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What it comes down to is this : this is a power play that is not inevitable .
