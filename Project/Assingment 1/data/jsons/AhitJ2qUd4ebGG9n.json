It takes a particularly aggressive approach that appears to be an outlier among states .\n`` Our law has been on the books . It has n't changed , and it is n't changing , '' said Oklahoma Election Board spokesman Bryan Dean .\nAt issue is when a state begins the process to notify and ultimately remove people from the rolls after a period of non-voting . In most states with similar laws , that process begins after voters miss two or more federal elections .\nIn Ohio , under the current Republican secretary of state , it starts if voters sit out just one election . They are removed from the rolls if they miss three federal elections over six years and fail to return an address-confirmation card .\nOklahoma is among the states that send confirmation notices to voters who have failed to cast ballots in two elections . As in most other states , voters who fail to respond are made inactive or taken off the rolls altogether if they do n't cast a ballot in subsequent elections .\nOpponents of the laws say their intent is to purge people from the rolls , particularly minorities and the poor who tend to vote Democratic . Supporters say voters are given plenty of chances to keep their active status and that the rules adhere to federal law requiring states to maintain accurate voter rolls .\nDemocrats and voting rights groups have expressed concern that other states will be emboldened by the ruling and adopt more aggressive tactics to kick voters off the rolls . In addition to Oklahoma , Georgia , Montana , Oregon , Pennsylvania and West Virginia have laws similar to Ohio 's .\nBut even Republican-led states where officials are concerned about voter fraud may be wary when it comes to following the Ohio model .\nOne hurdle is likely to come from local governments , where election administrators would have to deal with disgruntled voters and manage an increase in the number of people placed on inactive voter lists , said Myrna Perez , who has studied voter list practices in her role as deputy director of the Brennan Center 's Democracy Program .\n`` Using one election as an indicator is going to lead to a whole lot of false positives , '' she said . `` There are plenty of states that clean their voter rolls successfully without being as aggressive as Ohio .
