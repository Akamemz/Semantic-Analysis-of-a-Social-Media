''\nThere is a potential bonus of a Cruz nomination , this party leader explained . For the past several cycles , conservative activists have complained that by nominating relatively moderate candidates -- Romney in '12 and Sen.

But Kasich has won just one of the first 37 nominating contests -- his own state of Ohio -- and netted not one delegate in Tuesday 's races in Arizona and Utah .\nKasich 's brand of compassionate conservatism might sell in a general , and he would be a comfortable choice for the party establishment . But he has struggled to find traction within a party riven by anger .\nBase politics also has trapped the Republican leadership when it comes to Obama 's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court .\nWhile some opponents have portrayed Garland as a threat to the Second Amendment , his record over 19 years on the federal bench makes it hard to paint the judge out of the mainstream . He is more liberal than Republicans in the Senate would prefer but as moderate a choice as they probably would get from any Democratic president .\nA solid majority of Americans feels that the Senate should take up the Garland nomination rather than allowing the seat , left vacant by the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia , to go unfilled for more than a year .\nBut were Garland seated to replace Scalia , a conservative judicial icon , he would shift the balance of the court , giving it a majority of Democratic appointees for the first time in decades .\nThat 's why McConnell has ordained that the Garland nomination will not get even a hearing , much less a vote .\nThe right has threatened summary expulsion for any Senate Republican who breaks ranks with the majority leader over Garland .\nErick Erickson , an influential conservative commentator , threw down the gauntlet on my podcast , `` The Axe Files . ''\n`` If Republicans cave , I mean , this would be more the end of the Republican Party than Donald Trump , '' he said . `` Because , I mean , going back to Ronald Reagan 's election in 1980 , the Supreme Court has been the issue of the Republican Party .
