Citing a tweet from actor and right-wing troll James Woods , Infowars wondered if Clinton had been \u201c wearing an earpiece during last night \u2019 s presidential forum , \u201d as indicated by pictures that \u201c appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear . \u201d\nSo was it a flesh-colored earpiece as Infowars insisted ? Or was it a pearl-colored earpiece as Drudge claimed ? No one can say , but the ad hoc investigative group of conspiracy theorists and crackpot celebrities seems pretty convinced that Hillary Clinton had someone secretly feeding answers into her ear during the forum . The \u201c evidence \u201d was convincing enough that Donald Trump \u2019 s son \u2014 the elephant-butchering one , not the off-Broadway \u201c American Psycho \u201d one \u2014 tweeted out a link to the Infowars story .\nSo congratulations , everyone : we \u2019 ve officially reached the \u201c Presidential Candidate Cheats Via Secret Radio Technology \u201d stage of the 2016 election . It \u2019 s arrived a bit early this year , but this conspiratorial story line has become a recurring fixture of presidential campaigns thanks to the internet \u2019 s inexhaustible capacity to prey on gullibility and partisan reflexes .\nThe \u201c secret earpiece \u201d story made its first big splash in the latter stages of the 2004 presidential election , when blogger Joseph Cannon noticed an odd bulge in the back of George W. Bush \u2019 s suit jacket during an early October debate . \u201c Bush seemed to have a wire , or an odd protrusion of some sort , running down his back , \u201d Cannon wrote . \u201c Apparently , Fearless Leader used an earpiece during the confrontation . \u201d\nThe speculative accusation might have remained confined to the liberal blogosphere had it not been for the efforts of the website you \u2019 re reading at this moment , \u2588\u2588\u2588.com , which published half-skeptical write-ups of the circumstantial evidence surrounding the Bush \u201c wire \u201d and contacted NASA scientists for image analysis of the \u201c Bush bulge. \u201d From \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the story jumped to The Washington Post and The New York Times , which managed to obtain derisive denials from Bush campaign staffers . The \u201c bulge \u201d even became the centerpiece of a David Letterman riff . Fervent speculation aside , no direct evidence was ever produced indicating that Bush was wired during his debate with John Kerry . After Bush won re-election a month later , the issue receded back into the shaded corners of the internet .\nAlmost exactly four years later , as a young Democratic senator from Illinois took to the debate stage , it was the conservative blogosphere that found itself on secret earpiece patrol . During the Oct. 7 , 2008 , presidential debate , blogger Ann Althouse wrote that she had \u201c noticed that Obama was wearing an earpiece \u201d and posted a photo of the alleged device in Barack Obama \u2019 s ear . She quickly reconsidered her analysis and recognized that she was looking at light reflecting off Obama \u2019 s ear but left open the possibility that a secret earpiece might still exist : \u201c Just because the thing I saw was n't there does n't mean there was n't something there that I did n't see . \u201d\nThe 2012 election was largely free of any prominent earpiece speculation , though some chain emails bounced around , accusing Obama of wearing an earpiece and having a suspicious Bush-like suit bulge . That cycle \u2019 s primary example of overwrought \u201c he \u2019 s a cheater \u201d attacks were directed at Republican contender Mitt Romney , whom liberal bloggers accused of consulting crib notes during the first debate with Obama ( Romney was actually holding a handkerchief ) .\nThe relative lack of earpiece mania in 2012 has been more than compensated for in 2016 , with this ridiculous story about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s clandestine listening device featured prominently on one of the world \u2019 s most heavily trafficked political websites and endorsed by the son of the Republican nominee . Other Clinton-related conspiracies have proved to be remarkably persistent this cycle ( her allegedly failing health being the most prominent among them ) . So there \u2019 s an excellent chance that this one will stick around , too .\nThe question that arises from all this is why the \u201c earpiece \u201d phenomenon keeps popping up election after election , in defiance of consistent debunking and a lack of evidence to support the allegations . \u201c These sorts of beliefs are dependent on if you have a conspiracy worldview , and then on your partisanship , \u201d said Joseph Uscinski , a professor of political science at the University of Miami who \u2019 s written extensively about political conspiracy theories . \u201c People point fingers at the other side . \u201d\nBasically , if you \u2019 re already predisposed to believe that a candidate from the other party is going to cheat , then you \u2019 re more likely to take at face value an allegation that he or she cheated during a debate . When someone presents you with grainy screen captures of George W. Bush or Hillary Clinton and claims that they show telecommunications equipment hidden on their bodies , your partisanship enables you to bridge the sizable gap between the poor evidence and the firm conclusion that someone offstage was whispering into the candidate \u2019 s ear .\nThese cheating allegations tend to take the form of a secret earpiece simply because that \u2019 s really the only way someone participating in a nationally televised presidential debate could conceivably cheat . \u201c It \u2019 s just like when Hillary Clinton goes on [ \u201c Jimmy Kimmel Live \u201d ] and opens the pickle jar , \u201d Uscinski explained , referring to a humorous feat of strength that Clinton performed to mock questions about her health and that conspiratorial conservatives claimed was rigged . \u201c The only way she could have cheated in that test . . . was to have a preopened pickle jar .
