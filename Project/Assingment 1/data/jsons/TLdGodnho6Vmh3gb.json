Let \u2019 s say you want to masquerade as a Black Lives Matter supporter . You start by making lots of positive comments about the African-American community . You talk about how beautiful the girls are . You talk about their glorious cultural history and you try and engage with real activists who are busy on this subject. \u201d Now it \u2019 s time to ramp it up . \u201c Once you \u2019 ve established your credentials , you start slipping more and more toxic content into the mix . So , rather than saying positive things about your community , you start saying negative things about other communities . The war against colonialism is a theme that comes up on this page time and again . It \u2019 s a hint at violence .

Let \u2019 s get real people out on the streets. \u2019 And then , because you \u2019 re operating probably from some time zones away , you need to think , \u2018 Well , how do we get this to happen ? \u2019 And you start trying to reach out to genuine local organizations . Maybe you say , \u2019 Well , we can \u2019 t turn up on that day because we \u2019 ve got something else going on . Why don \u2019 t you organize this for us ? \u2019 \u201d In 2016 , Russian trolls organized political events for and against both presidential candidates .
