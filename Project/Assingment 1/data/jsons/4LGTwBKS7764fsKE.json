    "content": "A bill to remove abortion restrictions in Virginia was always going to be controversial . But a contentious committee hearing , and some confusing comments by Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam , have turned debate over the bill into a nationwide furor .\nVirginia House Bill 2491 would roll back a number of requirements , including a 24-hour waiting period and a mandate that second-trimester abortions take place in a hospital . Always something of a long shot in the Republican-controlled state legislature , the bill may now be doomed by the national firestorm surrounding it .\nThe controversy has centered on a provision concerning third-trimester abortions . Under current Virginia law , in order for a patient to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester , three doctors must certify that continuing the pregnancy would likely cause the patient \u2019 s death or \u201c substantially and irremediably impair \u201d her mental or physical health . The new bill would reduce the number of doctors to one , and remove the \u201c substantially and irremediably \u201d qualifier \u2014 abortions would be allowed in cases where a mother \u2019 s mental or physical health is threatened , even if the damage might not be irreversible .\nThe bill began inspiring outcry among abortion opponents nationwide after its sponsor , Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran , said in a committee hearing on Monday that it would technically allow abortion until the point of birth , if a doctor agreed it was necessary .\nGov . Northam , a Democrat , was asked about the bill in a radio interview on Wednesday , and his response only added to the controversy . Appearing to discuss what would happen if a child was born after a failed attempt at abortion , he said , \u201c the infant would be resuscitated if that \u2019 s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother . \u201d\nSome took Northam \u2019 s comments as an endorsement of infanticide . \u201c In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from \u2018 safe , legal , and rare \u2019 to \u2018 keep the newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide , \u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse ( R-NE ) in a statement on Wednesday .\nA spokesperson for Gov . Northam told \u2588\u2588\u2588 his comments were \u201c absolutely not \u201d a reference to infanticide , and that they \u201c focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor . \u201d\nBut Northam \u2019 s words helped stir up a nationwide debate around one of several recent efforts to expand abortion access at the state level . Laws restricting abortion access are nothing new , having proliferated nationwide since 2010 .\nBut now , buoyed by Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms and anxious to shore up access in anticipation of a challenge to Roe v. Wade , abortion rights supporters in state legislatures are backing bills that would roll back some of the earlier restrictions or introduce new protections for abortion rights . And while the particulars of the controversy in Virginia are unique , versions of it are likely to take place across the country as abortion-rights supporters back legislation in purple and even red states .\nThe controversy centers on the Virginia bill \u2019 s provisions for third-trimester abortions\nKathy Tran , a Democrat , was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017 , one of a record 28 women chosen for the legislative chamber that year . She introduced HB 2491 earlier this year , and in a committee hearing on Monday , she was questioned about the bill by fellow delegate Todd Gilbert , a Republican .\n\u201c How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman ? \u201d Gilbert asked .\n\u201c Through the third trimester , \u201d Tran responded . \u201c The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks . \u201d\n\u201c Where it \u2019 s obvious that a woman is about to give birth , \u201d Gilbert then asked , \u201c would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified ? She \u2019 s dilating . \u201d\nHB 2491 would not actually change the time limit for receiving an abortion in Virginia , Elizabeth Nash , senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . It would change the number of physicians required for approval , and broaden the health circumstances under which an abortion would be allowed .\nSituations in which a woman seeks an abortion when she is ready to give birth are incredibly uncommon , Nash said . Ninety-two percent of all abortions in America happen in the first trimester , according to Planned Parenthood . Only 1.4 percent of abortions happen at 21 weeks \u2019 gestation or beyond , according to the organization \u2014 the third trimester begins at around 28 weeks .\nNonetheless , footage of Tran \u2019 s comments soon spread in conservative circles . \u201c This literally makes me sick to my stomach , \u201d former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted on Tuesday .\nWhat is happening in our country .

She has not responded to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s request for comment .\nMeanwhile , in a Wednesday interview on Virginia radio station WTOP , reporter Julie Carey asked Northam to respond to Tran \u2019 s comments .\n\u201c Do you support her measure ? \u201d Carey asked . \u201c Explain her answer . \u201d\n\u201c This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers , physicians , and the mothers and fathers that are involved , \u201d Northam said . \u201c When we talk about third-trimester abortions , \u201d he added , \u201c it \u2019 s done in cases where there may be severe deformities . There may be a fetus that \u2019 s non-viable . \u201d\n\u201c If a mother is in labor , I can tell you exactly what would happen , \u201d the governor went on . \u201c The infant would be delivered .

The infant would be resuscitated if that \u2019 s what the mother and the family desired , and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother . \u201d\nNortham \u2019 s comments quickly sparked outrage , with some interpreting them as an endorsement of infanticide .\n\u201c The inhumanity on display here is hard to fathom , \u201d tweeted Seth Mandel , executive editor of the conservative Washington Examiner . \u201c The baby would be delivered and kept comfortable while its parents debated whether or not to execute it . \u201d\nI expected this description to be an exaggeration but no , it 's actually even worse .

Not murdering babies outside the womb . \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) January 30 , 2019\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller , President Trump said he was surprised to hear about Northam \u2019 s comments . He said he had watched video of Tran \u2019 s remarks , calling them \u201c terrible . \u201d\n\u201c Do you remember when I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb ? \u201d Trump asked . \u201c That \u2019 s what it is , that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re doing , it \u2019 s terrible . \u201d\nNortham \u2019 s communications director Ofirah Yheskel attempted to clarify the governor \u2019 s comments in a statement to media outlets on Wednesday .\n\u201c No woman seeks a third trimester abortion except in the case of tragic or difficult circumstances , such as a nonviable pregnancy or in the event of severe fetal abnormalities , and the governor \u2019 s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances went into labor , \u201d Yheskel said . \u201c Attempts to extrapolate these comments otherwise is in bad faith and underscores exactly why the governor believes physicians and women , not legislators , should make these difficult and deeply personal medical decisions . \u201d\nA spokesperson for the governor told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the governor had \u201c absolutely not \u201d been referring to the euthanasia of infants born after a failed abortion . \u201c The governor \u2019 s comments focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor , \u201d the spokesperson said .\nIt \u2019 s still not entirely clear what Northam was trying to say about HB 2491 . The interview was confusing in other ways beyond his comments about infants being born . Northam also said he supported having \u201c at least two providers \u201d involved in the decision of whether to perform a third-trimester abortion , although the current law requires three and HB 2491 would require one .\nSome have raised the possibility that Northam was not fully familiar with the bill at issue . Whatever the case , his comments added fuel to the fire already blazing around the bill .\nDebates like this could become more common with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nNortham \u2019 s comments added to concern that abortion opponents already felt over HB 2491 \u2019 s broadening of the circumstances under which someone could seek a third-trimester abortion .\n\u201c It seemed like he was really raising the possibility of making a deliberate decision to let an infant , even who had been resuscitated , die because of considerations like the mental health of the mother , \u201d Matthew Lee Anderson , the founder of Christian politics and culture website Mere Orthodoxy , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 of the governor \u2019 s remarks .\nFor many abortion opponents , Anderson said , the possibility of allowing third-trimester abortions due to mental health concerns was troubling . A doctor could argue , for instance , that having a child with Down syndrome would negatively impact a mother \u2019 s mental health , he said .\nIt \u2019 s not necessarily reassuring that it \u2019 s extremely uncommon for a patient to seek abortion when about to give birth , according to Anderson . \u201c Wildly implausible scenarios become plausible through moments like this , \u201d he said . \u201c We talk about these rare instances and the possibility of them in order to bring up deeper concerns about the principles at work in our decision-making , and we make laws not just to handle general categories of people but to address what happens on the margins as well . \u201d\nMeanwhile , some say that bringing up the idea of someone seeking an abortion while in labor , as Gilbert did , was a way of hijacking debate on the bill . \u201c The idea of raising that means that you \u2019 re trying just to derail this bill , \u201d the Guttmacher Institute \u2019 s Nash said .\nThe Virginia bill comes as some other states are passing laws to roll back abortion restrictions or otherwise expand access . New York \u2019 s recently passed Reproductive Health Act , for instance , allows abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or if there is a threat to the mother \u2019 s health . Under previous law , which allowed an abortion at that point only if a mother \u2019 s life was in danger , reproductive rights advocates say women were forced to travel long distances and pay thousands of dollars in order to get an abortion , sometimes when they were very ill .\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union , for instance , highlighted the case of Sophia , a woman who became pregnant during treatment for several types of cancer . Doctors said the fetus was unlikely to survive , but because Sophia was past the 24-week limit , she had to travel 2,000 miles for the procedure , a trip made risky because of her illness .\nMeanwhile , opponents of the New York law have raised concerns similar to Anderson \u2019 s , worrying that the health provision in the new law may include mental health issues . \u201c When you use the term \u2018 health of the woman , \u2019 that \u2019 s very elastic , \u201d Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League , told CBS New York . \u201c That has been defined as mental health , she \u2019 s depressed , she doesn \u2019 t feel good that day . \u201d\nThe controversy over the Virginia bill may have ended its already-slim chances for passage \u2014 for now , it has been tabled by the House of Delegates . But such controversies will surely arise again as reproductive rights advocates seek to shore up abortion protections where they can \u2014 and abortion opponents seek to pass new restrictions \u2014 in anticipation that the Supreme Court , with the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh , may vote to overturn Roe v. Wade .\nIf the landmark abortion decision is overturned or substantially weakened , states will be able to enforce abortion restrictions that would have been blocked by courts in the past , including bans on abortion before fetal viability .\n\u201c The change in the Supreme Court has just sent this huge wave across state legislatures , \u201d Nash said . \u201c Conservative legislators are looking to ban abortion because they \u2019 re seeing an opportunity , and progressive legislators are looking to protect abortion rights because they \u2019 re fearful of what could happen at the Supreme Court . \u201d\nAbortion restrictions at the state level are nothing new : hundreds have been passed since 2010 , when Republicans took over many statehouses . And to some degree , abortion rights advocates have been playing defense , protesting those bills when they come up and challenging them in the courts .\nBut bills like those in Virginia and New York that seek to expand access have been slowly growing more common since 2014 , Nash said . As they become more common , a new picture will emerge in the abortion debate : one of abortion rights supporters attempting to gain ground and opponents pushing back . The controversy over the Virginia bill \u2014 fed though it may have been by confusing comments by Gov . Northam \u2014 is likely only the beginning .\nCorrection : An earlier version of this story misstated the publication at which Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief . It is the Daily Wire .",
