    "content": "His verbal stumbles have voters worried about his mental fitness . Maybe they \u2019 d be more understanding if they knew he \u2019 s still fighting a stutter .\nHis eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it . We \u2019 ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes , and so far , every time he seems close , he backs away , or leads us in a new direction . There are competing theories in the press , but Joe Biden has kept mum on the subject . I want to hear him explain it . I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . \u201c I\u2014um\u2014I don \u2019 t remember , \u201d Biden says . His voice has that familiar shake , the creak and the croak . \u201c I \u2019 d have to see it . I-I-I don \u2019 t remember. \u201d We \u2019 re in Biden \u2019 s mostly vacant Washington , D.C. , campaign office on an overcast Tuesday at the end of the summer . Since entering the Democratic presidential-primary race in April , Biden has largely avoided in-depth interviews . When I first reached out , in late June , his press person was polite but noncommittal : Was an interview really necessary for the story ?\nThen came the second debate , at the end of July , in Detroit . The first one , a month earlier , had been a disaster for Biden . He was unprepared when Senator Kamala Harris criticized both his past resistance to federally mandated busing and a recent speech in which he \u2019 d waxed fondly about collaborating with segregationist senators . Some of his answers that night had been meander\u00ading and difficult to parse , feeding into the narrative that he wasn \u2019 t just prone to verbal slipups\u2014he \u2019 s called himself a \u201c gaffe machine \u201d \u2014but that his age was a problem , that he was confused and out of touch . Detroit was Biden \u2019 s chance to regain control of the narrative . And then something else happened . The candidates were talking about health care . At first , Biden sounded strong , confident , presidential : \u201c My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be One . Thousand . Dollars . Because we\u2014 \u201d He stopped . He pinched his eyes closed . He lifted his hands and thrust them forward , as if trying to pull the missing sound from his mouth . \u201c We f-f-f-f-further\nsupport\u2014 \u201d He opened his eyes . \u201c The uh-uh-uh-uh\u2014 \u201d His chin dipped toward his chest . \u201c The-uh , the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan. \u201d Biden also stumbled when trying to say immune system . Fox News edited these moments into a mini montage . Stifling laughter , the host Steve Hilton narrated : \u201c As the right words struggled to make that perilous journey from Joe Biden \u2019 s brain to Joe Biden \u2019 s mouth , half the time he just seemed to give up with this somewhat tragic and limp admission of defeat . \u201d\nSeveral days later , Biden \u2019 s team got back in touch with me . One of his aides gingerly asked whether I \u2019 d noticed the former vice president stutter during the debate . Of course I had\u2014I stutter , far worse than Biden . The aide said he was ready to talk about it . Recently , after Biden stumbled multiple times during the Atlanta debate , the topic became even more relevant . \u201c So how are you , man ? \u201d Biden is in his usual white button-down and navy suit , a flag pin on the left lapel . Up close , he looks like he \u2019 s lost weight since leaving office in 2017 . His height is commanding , but , as he approaches his 77th birthday , he doesn \u2019 t fill out his suit jacket like he used to . I stutter as I begin to ask my first question . \u201c I \u2019 ve only \u2026 told a few people I \u2019 m \u2026 d-doing this piece . Every time I \u2026 describe it , I get \u2026 caught on the w-word-uh stuh-tuh-tuh-tutter. \u201d \u201c So did I , \u201d Biden replies . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t \u201d \u2014he interrupts himself\u2014 \u201c can \u2019 t define who you are . \u201d\nMaybe you \u2019 ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter . A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult , because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly . But on other occasions , like that night in Detroit , Biden \u2019 s lingering stutter is hard to miss . He stutters\u2014\u00adif slightly\u2014on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office . Before addressing the debate specifically , I mention what I \u2019 ve just heard . \u201c I want to ask you , as , you know , a \u2026 stutterer to , uh , to a \u2026 stutterer . When you were \u2026 talking a couple minutes ago , it , it seemed to \u2026 my ear , my eye \u2026 did you have \u2026 trouble on s ? Or on \u2026 m ? \u201d\nBiden looks down . He pivots to the distant past , telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid . \u201c But , you know , I haven \u2019 t stuttered in so long that it \u2019 s\nhhhhard for me to remember the specific\u2014 \u201d He pauses . \u201c What I do remember is the feeling. \u201d I started stuttering at age 4 . I still struggle to say my own name . When I called the gas company recently , the automated voice apologized for not being able to understand me . This happens a lot , so I try to say \u201c representative , \u201d but r \u2019 s are tough too . When I reach a human , I \u2019 m inevitably asked whether we have a poor connection . Busy bartenders will walk away and serve someone else when I take too long to say the name of a beer . Almost every deli guy chuckles as I fail to enunciate my order , despite the fact that I \u2019 ve cut it down to just six words : \u201c Turkey club , white toast , easy mayo. \u201d I used to just point at items on the menu . My head will shake on a really bad stutter . People have casually asked whether I have Parkinson \u2019 s . I curl my toes inside my shoes or tap my foot as a distraction to help me get out of it , a behavior that I \u2019 ve repeated so often , it \u2019 s become a tic . Sometimes I shuffle a pen between my hands . When I was little , I used to press my palm against my forehead in an effort to force the missing word out of my brain . Back then , my older brother would imitate this motion and the accompanying sound , a dull whine\u2014something between a cow and a sheep . A kid at baseball camp , Michael , referred to me as \u201c Stutter Boy. \u201d He \u2019 d snap his fingers and repeat it as if calling a dog . \u201c Stutter Boy ! Stutter Boy ! \u201d In college , I applied for a job at a coffee shop . I stuttered horribly through the interview , and the owner told me he couldn \u2019 t hire me , because he wanted his caf\u00e9 to be \u201c a place where customers feel comfortable . \u201d\nStuttering is a neurological disorder that affects roughly 70 million people , about 3 million of whom live in the United States . It has a strong genetic component : Two-thirds of stutterers have a family member who actively stutters or used to . Biden \u2019 s uncle on his mother \u2019 s side\u2014 \u201c Uncle Boo-Boo , \u201d as he was called\u2014stuttered his whole life . In the most basic sense , a stutter is a repetition , prolongation , or block in producing a sound . It typically presents between the ages of 2 and 4 , in up to twice as many boys as girls , who also have a higher recovery rate . During the develop\u00admental years , some children \u2019 s stutter will disappear completely without intervention or with speech therapy . The longer someone stutters , however , the lower the chances of a full recovery\u2014\u00adperhaps due to the decreasing plasticity of the brain . Research suggests that no more than a quarter of people who still stutter at 10 will completely rid themselves of the affliction as adults . \u201c Mr . Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden , what \u2019 s that word ? , \u201d a nun asked Joe Biden in front of his seventh-grade classmates . The cultural perception of stutterers is that they \u2019 re fearful , anxious people , or simply dumb , and that stuttering is the result . But it doesn \u2019 t work like that . Let \u2019 s say you \u2019 re in fourth grade and you have to stand up and recite state capitals . You know that Juneau is the capital of Alaska , but you also know that you almost always block on the j sound . You become intensely anxious not because you don \u2019 t know the answer , but because you do know the answer , and you know you \u2019 re going to stutter on it .\nStuttering can feel like a series of betrayals . Your body betrays you when it refuses to work in concert with your brain to produce smooth speech . Your brain betrays you when it fails to recall the solutions you practiced after school with a speech therapist , allegedly in private , later learning that your mom was on the other side of a mirror , watching in the dark like a detective . If you \u2019 re a lucky stutterer , you have friends and family who build you back up , but sometimes your protectors betray you too . A Catholic nun betrayed Biden when he was in seventh grade . \u201c I think I was No . 5 in alphabetical order , \u201d Biden says . He points over my right shoulder and stares into the middle distance as the movie rolls in his mind . \u201c We \u2019 d sit along the radiators by the window. \u201d The office we \u2019 re in is awash in framed memories : Biden and his family , Biden and Barack Obama , Biden in a denim shirt posing for InStyle . The shelf behind the desk features , among other books , Jon Meacham \u2019 s The Soul of America . It \u2019 s a phrase Biden has adopted for his campaign this time around , his third attempt at the presidency . In almost every speech , Biden warns potential voters that 2020 is not merely an election , but a battle \u201c for the soul of America. \u201d Sometimes he swaps in nation .\nJoe Biden : \u2018 We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation \u2019 But now we \u2019 re back in middle school . The students are taking turns reading a book , one by one , up and down the rows . \u201c I could count down how many paragraphs , and I \u2019 d memorize it , because I found it easier to memorize than look at the page and read the word . I \u2019 d pretend to be reading , \u201d Biden says . \u201c You learned early on who the hell the bullies were , \u201d he tells me later . \u201c You could tell by the look , couldn \u2019 t you ? \u201d For most stutterers , reading out loud summons peak dread . A chunk of text that may take a fluent person roughly a minute to read could take a stutterer five or 10 times as long . Four kids away , three kids away . Your shoulders tighten . Two away . The back of your neck catches fire . One away . Then it happens , and the room fills with secondhand embarrassment . Someone breathes a heavy sigh . Someone else laughs . At least one kid mimics your stutter while you \u2019 re actively stuttering . You never talk about it . At night , you stare at the ceiling above your bed , reliving it . \u201c The paragraph I had to read was : \u2018 Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentleman . He laid his cloak upon the muddy road suh-suh-so the lady wouldn \u2019 t soil her shoes when she entered the carriage , \u2019 \u201d Biden tells me , slightly and unintentionally tripping up on the word so . \u201c And I said , \u2018 Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man who\u2014 \u2019 and then the nun said , \u2018 Mr . Biden , what is that word ? \u2019 And it was gentleman that she wanted me to say , not gentle man . And she said , \u2018 Mr . Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden , what \u2019 s that word ? \u2019 \u201d\nBiden says he rose from his desk and left the classroom in protest , then walked home . The family story is that his mother , Jean , drove him back to school and confronted the nun with the made-for-TV phrase \u201c You do that again , I \u2019 ll knock your bonnet off your head ! \u201d I ask Biden what went through his mind as the nun mocked him . \u201c Anger , rage , humiliation , \u201d he says . His speech becomes staccato . \u201c A feeling of , uh\u2014like I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve experienced\u2014it just drops out of your chest , just , like , you feel \u2026 a void. \u201d He lifts his hands up to his face like he did on the debate stage in July , to guide the v sound out of his mouth : void . By all accounts , Biden was both popular and a strong athlete in high school . He was class president at Archmere Academy , in Claymont , Delaware . His nickname was \u201c Dash \u201d \u2014not a reference to his speed on the football field , but rather another way to mock his stutter . \u201c It was like Morse code\u2014dot dot dot , dash dash dash dash , \u201d Biden says . \u201c Even though by that time I started to overcome it. \u201d I ask him to expand on the relationship between anger and humiliation , or shame . \u201c Shame is a big piece of it , \u201d he says , then segues into a story about meeting a stutterer while campaigning . I bring it back up a little later , this time more directly : \u201c When have you felt shame ? \u201d \u201c Not for a long , long , long time . But especially when I was in grade school and high school . Because that \u2019 s the time when everything is , you know , it \u2019 s rough . They talk about \u2018 mean girls \u2019 ? There \u2019 s mean boys , too . \u201d\nBill Bowden had the locker next to Biden \u2019 s at Archmere . I called Bowden recently . \u201c It was just kind of a funny thing , you know ? \u201d he told me . \u201c Hopefully he wasn \u2019 t hurt by it. \u201d Bob Markel , another high-school buddy of Biden \u2019 s , went a little further when we spoke : \u201c \u2018 H-H-H-H-Hey , J-J-J-J-J-Joe B-B-B-B-Biden \u2019 \u2014that \u2019 s how he \u2019 d be addressed. \u201d Markel said the Archmere guys called him \u201c Stutterhead , \u201d or \u201c Hey , Stut ! \u201d for short . He fears that he himself may have made fun of Biden once or twice . \u201c I never remember him being offended . He probably was , \u201d Markel said . \u201c I think one of his coping mechanisms was to not show it. \u201d Bowden and Markel have remained friends with Biden to this day . Before collecting from customers on his paper route , Biden would preplay conversations in his mind , banking lines\u2014a tactic he still sometimes uses on the campaign trail , he says . \u201c I knew the one guy loved the Phillies . And he \u2019 d asked me about them all the time . And I knew another person would ask me about my sister , so I would practice an answer. \u201d After trying and failing at speech therapy in kinder\u00adgarten , Biden waged a personal war on his stutter in his bedroom as a young teen . He \u2019 d hold a flashlight to his face in front of his bedroom mirror and recite Yeats and Emerson with attention to rhythm , searching for that elusive control . He still knows the lines by heart : \u201c Meek young men grow up in libraries , believing it their duty to accept the views , which Cicero , which Locke , which Bacon , have given , forgetful that Cicero , Locke , and Bacon were only young men in libraries , when they wrote these books . \u201d\nBiden performs the passage for me with total fluency , knowing where and when to pause , knowing how many words he can say before needing a breath . This is what stutterers learn to do : reclaim control of their airflow ; think in full phrases , not individual words . I ask Biden what his moment of dread used to be in that essay . \u201c Well , looking back on it , \u2018 Meek young men grow up in li-li-libraries , \u2019 \u201d he begins again . \u201c \u2018 Li \u2019 \u2014the l. \u201d \u201c That kind of sound , the l sound , is like the \u2026 r sound , \u201d I say . \u201c Yes. \u201d \u201c Sometimes I \u2019 ve noticed , watching old clips , it looks like you do have a little trouble on the r. It \u2019 s your middle initial. \u201d \u201c Yeah. \u201d \u201c Like \u2018 ruh-ruh-ruh-remember , \u2019 \u201d I say , intentionally stuttering on the r. \u201c Well , I may . I-I-I-I-I haven \u2019 t thought I have . But I-I-I-I don \u2019 t doubt there \u2019 s probably ways people could pick up that there \u2019 s something . But I don \u2019 t consciously think of it anymore. \u201d Biden says he hasn \u2019 t felt himself caught in a traditional stutter in several decades . \u201c I mean , I can \u2019 t remember a time where I \u2019 ve ever worried before a crowd of 80,000 people or 800 people or 80 people\u2014I haven \u2019 t had that feeling of dread since , I guess , speech class in college , \u201d he says , referring to an under\u00adgraduate public-speaking course at the University of Delaware . This is when I ask him what happened that night in Detroit . After saying he doesn \u2019 t remember , Biden opines : \u201c I \u2019 m everybody \u2019 s target ; they have to take me down . And so , what I found is\u2014not anymore\u2014I \u2019 ve found that it \u2019 s difficult to deal with some of the criticism , based on the nature of the person directing the criticism . It \u2019 s awful hard to be , to respond the same way in a national debate\u2014especially when you \u2019 re , you know , the guy who is characterized as the white-guy-of-\u00adprivilege kind of thing\u2014to turn and say to someone who says , \u2018 I \u2019 m not saying you \u2019 re a racist , but \u2026 \u2019 and know you \u2019 re being set up . So I have to admit to you , I found my mind going , What the hell ? How do I respond to that ? Because I know she \u2019 s being completely unfair . \u201d\nI eventually realize that he \u2019 s describing the moment from the first debate , when Harris criticized his record on race . \u201c These aren \u2019 t debates , \u201d he continues . \u201c These are one-minute assertions . And I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anybody who hasn \u2019 t been taking shots at me , which is okay . I \u2019 m a big boy , don \u2019 t get me wrong. \u201d Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy . I can only speculate as to why Biden \u2019 s campaign agreed to this interview , but I assume the reasoning went something like this : If Biden disclosed to me , a person who stutters , that he himself still actively stutters , perhaps voters would cut him some slack when it comes to verbal misfires , as well as errors that seem more related to memory and cognition . But whenever I asked Biden about what appeared to be his present-day stuttering , the notably verbose candidate became clipped , or said he didn \u2019 t remember , or spun off to somewhere new . I wondered if I reminded Biden of his old self , a ghost from his youth , the stutterer he used to be . He and I are about the same height . We happened to be wearing the exact same outfit that day : navy suit , white shirt , no tie . We both went to all-male prep schools , the sort of place where displaying any weakness is a liability . As I listened to the recording of our interview , I remembered how I used to respond when people asked me about my stutter . I \u2019 d shut down . I \u2019 d try to change the subject . I \u2019 d almost always look away .\nIn early September , I got in touch with my high-school speech pathologist , Joseph Donaher , who practices at the Children \u2019 s Hospital of Philadelphia . I hadn \u2019 t heard Donaher \u2019 s voice for almost 15 years . Immediately , I was transported back to the little window\u00adless room in the hospital where we used to meet . Donaher was the first therapist\u2014\u00adreally the first person\u2014\u00adwho ever leveled with me . I can still see his face , the neutrality in his eyes on the day he looked at me square and said the sentence my friends and parents had avoided saying my entire life : You have a severe stutter . Donaher and his colleagues try to help their patients open up about the shame and low self-worth that accompany stuttering . Instead of focusing solely on mechanics , or on the ability to communicate , they first build up the desire to communicate at all . They then share techniques such as elongating vowels and lightly approaching hard-consonant clusters , meaning just touching on the first sound in a word like stutter\u2014the st\u2014to keep the mouth and throat from tensing up and interfering with speech . The goal isn \u2019 t to be totally fluent but , simply put , to stutter better . This evolution in treatment has been accompanied by a new movement to destigmatize the disorder , similar to the drive to view autism through a lens of \u201c neuro\u00addiversity \u201d rather than as a pathology . The idea is to accept , even embrace , one \u2019 s stutter . There are practical reasons for this : Research shows , according to Donaher , that the simple disclosure \u201c I stutter \u201d benefits both the stutterer and the listener\u2014the former gets to explain what \u2019 s happening and ease the awkward tension so the latter isn \u2019 t stuck wondering what \u2019 s \u201c wrong \u201d with this person . Saying those two words is harder than it seems . \u201c I \u2019 m working with people who spend their whole lives and are never able to disclose it , \u201d Donaher told me . Biden says his father taught him about \u201c shouldering burdens with grace. \u201d Specifically , he told his son , \u201c Never complain . Never explain. \u201d Eric S. Jackson , an assistant professor of communicative sciences and dis\u00adorders at NYU , told me he believes that Biden \u2019 s eye movements\u2014the blinks , the downward glances\u2014are part of his ongoing efforts to manage his stutter . \u201c As kids we figure out : Oh , if I move parts of my body not associated with the speech system , sometimes it helps me get through these blocks faster , \u201d Jackson , a stutterer himself , explained . Jackson credits an intensive program at the American Institute for Stuttering , in Manhattan , with bringing him back from a \u201c rock bottom \u201d period in his mid-20s , when he says his stutter kept him from meeting women or speaking up enough to reach his professional goals . Afterward , Jackson went all in on disclosure : Every day for six months , he stood up during the subway ride to and from work and announced that he was a person who stutters . \u201c I had this new relationship with my stuttering\u2014I was like Hercules , \u201d he told me . At 41 , Jackson still stutters , but in conversation he confidently maintains eye contact and appears relaxed . He wishes Biden would be more transparent about his intermittent disfluency . \u201c Running for president is essentially the biggest stage in the world . For him to come out and say \u2018 I still stutter and it \u2019 s fine \u2019 would be an amazing , empowering message . \u201d\nOccasionally , Biden has used present-tense verbs when discussing his stutter . \u201c I find myself , when I \u2019 m tired , cuh-cuh-\u00adcatching myself , like that , \u201d he said during a 2016 American Institute for Stuttering speech . Biden has used the phrase we stutterers at times , but in most public appearances and interviews , Biden talks about how he overcame his speech problem , and how he believes others can too . You can watch videos posted by his campaign in which Biden meets young stutterers and encourages them to follow his lead . They \u2019 re sweet clips , even if the underlying message\u2014\u00adbeat it or bust\u2014is out of sync with the normalization movement . Emma Alpern is a 32-year-old copy editor who co-leads the Brooklyn chapter of the National Stuttering Association and co-founded NYC Stutters , which puts on a day-long conference for stuttering de\u00adstigmatization . Alpern told me that she \u2019 s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden , and that it \u2019 s been \u201c frustrating \u201d to watch the media portray Biden \u2019 s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty . \u201c Biden allows that to happen by not naming it for what it is , \u201d she said , though she \u2019 s not sure that his presidential candidacy would benefit if he were more forthcoming . \u201c I think he \u2019 s dug himself into a hole of not saying that he still stutters for so long that it would strike people as a little weird. \u201d Biden has presented the same life story for decades . He \u2019 s that familiar face\u2014Uncle Joe . He was born 11 months after Pearl Harbor and grew up in the last era of definitive \u201c good guys \u201d and \u201c bad guys. \u201d He \u2019 s the dependable guy , the tenacious guy , the aviators-and-crossed-arms guy . That guy doesn \u2019 t stutter ; that guy used to stutter .\n\u201c My dad taught me the value of constancy , effort , and work , and he taught me about shouldering burdens with grace , \u201d Biden writes in the first chapter of his 2007 memoir , Promises to Keep . \u201c He used to quote Benjamin Disraeli : \u2018 Never complain . Never explain. \u2019 \u201d Stephen Colbert launches across the Ed Sullivan Theater stage , as if from a pinball spring . It \u2019 s early September , and his Late Show taping is about to begin . To warm up , he takes a few questions from the studio audience . Someone asks what he \u2019 d want in a potential new president . \u201c Empathy ? \u201d Colbert deadpans . \u201c A soul ? \u201d Colbert tapes in Midtown Manhattan on the same stage where the Beatles made their American television debut 55 years ago , when Joe Biden was a mere 22 . Biden struts out to a standing ovation and throws up his hands in amazement : For me ? A brief \u201c Joe ! Joe ! Joe ! \u201d chant erupts . At first , Colbert lobs softballs , and Biden touches on the key parts of his 2020 stump speech : Why voters must stand up to the existential threat of Trumpism and how the Charlottesville , Virginia , white-supremacist rally crystallized his decision to run . Then Colbert goes for it . \u201c In the last few weeks , you \u2019 ve confused New Hampshire for Vermont ; said\nBobby Kennedy and MLK were assassinated in the late \u2019 70s ; assured us , \u2018 I am not going nuts. \u2019 Follow-up question : Are you going nuts ? \u201d\n\u201c Look , the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show was because\u2014 \u201d The audience howls . Biden flashes a flirty smile . Colbert adjusts his glasses , sticks his pen in his mouth , and nods in approval . The joke was probably canned , but Biden landed it . Colbert continues to press him about accuracy issues in his storytelling . The studio audience is silent ; I \u2019 m watching from the balcony and can hear the theater \u2019 s air-conditioning humming overhead . \u201c I-I-I-I-I don \u2019 t get wrong things like , uh , ya know , there is a , we , we should lock kids up in cages at the border . I mean , I don \u2019 t\u2014 \u201d People applaud before Biden can finish . When the interview is over , Biden receives a second standing ovation . He peers up toward the rafters , using his hand as a visor against the bright lights . A white spotlight follows him offstage . Several minutes later , he glides through the stage door and out onto West 53rd Street . People call to him from the sidewalk . \u201c Joe ! Joe Biden ! \u201d He climbs into the back of an idling black SUV , and the doors\nclunk close . Read : Tyranny of the 70-Somethings I follow Biden for a couple of days while he campaigns in New Hampshire . His town halls have a distinctly Norman Rockwell vibe . One takes place in the middle of the day on the third floor of a former textile mill , another on a stretch of grass as the wind whips off the Piscataqua River . His crowds are predominantly older , filled with people who stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and wait patiently to ask questions . After he speaks , Biden typically walks offstage to Bruce Springsteen \u2019 s \u201c We Take Care of Our Own , \u201d then saunters down the rope line for handshakes and hugs and selfies . One voter after another tells me they \u2019 re unaware of Biden \u2019 s stutter . \u201c Knowing that he has had something like that to deal with and overcame it , as well as other really sad things that have happened\u2014\u00ad\u00adit just makes me like him more , \u201d says 70-year-old Grace Payne .\nBack in New York , I start to wonder if I \u2019 m forcing Biden into a box where he doesn \u2019 t belong . My box . Could I be jealous that his present stutter is less obvious than mine ? That he can go sentences at a time without a single block or repetition ? Even the way I \u2019 m writing this piece\u2014\u00adkeeping Biden \u2019 s stammers , his ums and pauses , on the page\u2014seems hypocritical . Here I am highlighting the glitches in his speech , when the journalistic courtesy , convention even , is to edit them out . I spend weeks watching Biden more than listening to him , trying to \u201c catch him in the act \u201d of stuttering on camera . There \u2019 s one . There \u2019 s one . That was a bad one . Also , I start stuttering more . In September , before the third Democratic debate , in Houston , I called Michael Sheehan , a Washington , D.C.\u2013area communications coach whose company website boasts clients ranging from Nike to the Treasury Department . Sheehan worked with President Bill Clinton while he was in office and began consulting on and off for Biden in 2002 , when he was in the Senate . On the day we spoke , he was in Wilmington , Delaware , doing debate prep with Biden . Sheehan and I traded stories of daily indignities\u2014\u00ad\u00adhe stutters too . \u201c I remember exactly where the deli was ; it was on 71st and First Avenue , \u201d he said with an ache in his voice . He lamented the interventionists , the people who volunteer , \u201c \u2018 You know , why don \u2019 t you speak more slowly ? \u2019 I always want to say \u2018 Holy shit ! Why didn \u2019 t I think of that ? Thank you ! \u2019 \u201d\nSheehan \u2019 s own stutter improved , but didn \u2019 t fully go away , when he took up speech and debate in high school . This eventually led him to the theater , which is a common , if surprising , place where some stutterers find that they \u2019 re able to speak with relative ease . Taking on a character , another voice , the theory goes , relies on a different neural pathway from the one used in conversation . Many successful actors have battled stutters\u2014Samuel L. Jackson , Bruce Willis , Emily Blunt , James Earl Jones . In 2014 , Jones , whose muscular baritone is the bedrock of one of the most quoted lines in film history , told NPR that he doesn \u2019 t use the word cured to describe his apparent fluency . \u201c I just work with it , \u201d he said . At an August town hall , Biden briefly blocked on Obama , before subbing in my boss . The headlines afterward ? \u201c Biden Forgets Obama \u2019 s Name. \u201d Sheehan was extremely careful with the language he used to describe Biden \u2019 s speech patterns\u2014 \u201c I can \u2019 t say it \u2019 s a stutter \u201d \u2014\u00adthough he noted his friend \u2019 s habit of abruptly changing directions mid-sentence . \u201c I do hear those little pauses , but I really don \u2019 t hear the stuff that you would hear from me or I would hear from you , \u201d he said . A few minutes into our conversation , he choked up while discussing Biden \u2019 s tender\u00adness toward young stutterers . \u201c Sometimes I feel when he goes a little long on a speech , he \u2019 s just making up for lost time , you know ? \u201d Sheehan told me about a night when he came home with his wife and saw the answering-\u00admachine light blinking : \u201c Hey , Michael , it \u2019 s Joe Biden . I just was watching The King \u2019 s Speech with my granddaughter , and I just thought I \u2019 d give you a call , because it made me think of you . Goodbye ! \u201d He says the message felt like a secret fraternity handshake : \u201c You and I have both been there , and only people in that society know what that is about . \u201d\nIn Biden \u2019 s office , the first time I bring up his current stuttering , he asks me whether I \u2019 ve seen The King \u2019 s Speech . He speaks almost mystically about the award-winning 2010 film . \u201c When King George VI , when he stood up in 1939 , everyone knew he stuttered , and they knew what courage it took for him to stand up at that stadium and try to speak\u2014and it gave them courage \u2026 I could feel that . It was that sinking feeling , like\u2014oh my God , I remember how you felt . You feel like , I don \u2019 t know \u2026 almost like you \u2019 re being sucked into a black hole. \u201d Presidential candidates usually don \u2019 t speak about their bleakest moments , certainly not this viscerally . It resembles the way Biden writes in his memoir about the aftermath of the 1972 car accident that killed his first wife and young daughter and critically injured his two sons , Beau and Hunter : \u201c I could not speak , only felt this hollow core grow in my chest , like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole. \u201d Related Stories Joe Biden Is Schr\u00f6dinger \u2019 s Candidate\nThe President \u2019 s Cognitive Decline A few weeks later , I ask Jill Biden what she remembers about sitting next to her husband during the movie . \u201c It was one of those moments in a marriage where you just sort of understand without words being spoken , \u201d she says . As he watched The King \u2019 s Speech , Biden accurately guessed that the screenwriter , David Seidler , was a stutterer . \u201c He showed me a copy of a speech they found in an attic that the king had actually used , where he marks his\u2014it \u2019 s exactly what I do ! \u201d Biden tells me , his voice lifting . \u201c My staff , when I have them put something on a prompter\u2014I wish I had something to show you . \u201d\nHe pulls out a legal pad and begins drawing diagonal lines a few inches apart , as if diagramming invisible sentences : x words , breath , y words , breath . \u201c Because it \u2019 s just the way I have\u2014the , the best way for me to read a , um , a speech . I mean , when I saw The King \u2019 s Speech , and the speech\u2014I didn \u2019 t know anybody who did that ! \u201d Biden is running for president on a simple message : America is not Trump . I \u2019 m not Trump . I \u2019 ll lead us out of this . With every new debate , with every new \u201c gaffe , \u201d the media continue to ask whether Biden has the stamina for the job . And with every passing month , his competitors\u2014namely Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2014have gained on him in the polls . A stutter does not get worse as a person ages , but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy . Biden talks all day to audiences both small and large . In addition to periodically stuttering or blocking on certain sounds , he appears to intentionally not stutter by switching to an alternative word\u2014a technique called \u201c circumlocution \u201d \u2014\u00adwhich can yield mangled syntax . I \u2019 ve been following practically everything he \u2019 s said for months now , and sometimes what is quickly characterized as a memory lapse is indeed a stutter . As Eric Jackson , the speech pathologist , pointed out to me , during a town hall in August Biden briefly blocked on Obama , before quickly subbing in my boss . The headlines after the event ? \u201c Biden Forgets Obama \u2019 s Name. \u201d Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought , it seems unrelated to stuttering , like he \u2019 s just making a mistake . The kind of mistake other candidates make too , though less frequently than he does .\nDuring his 2016 address at the American Institute for Stuttering , Biden told the room that he \u2019 d turned down an invitation to speak at a dinner organized by the group years earlier . \u201c I was afraid if people knew I stuttered , \u201d he said , \u201c they would have thought something was wrong with me. \u201d Yet even when sharing these old , hard stories , Biden regularly characterizes stuttering as \u201c the best thing that ever happened \u201d to him . \u201c Stuttering gave me an insight I don \u2019 t think I ever would have had into other people \u2019 s pain , \u201d he says . I admire his empathy , even if I disagree with his strict adherence to a tidy redemption narrative . In Biden \u2019 s office , as my time is about to run out , I bring up the fact that Trump crudely mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the 2016 campaign . \u201c So far , he \u2019 s called you \u2018 Sleepy Joe. \u2019 Is \u2018 St-St-St-Stuttering Joe \u2019 next ? \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t think so , \u201d Biden says , \u201c because if you ask the polls \u2018 Does Biden stutter ? Has he ever stuttered ? , \u2019 you \u2019 d have 80 to 95 percent of people say no. \u201d If Trump goes there , Biden adds , \u201c it \u2019 ll just expose him for what he is. \u201d I ask Biden something else we \u2019 ve been circling : whether he worries that people would pity him if they thought he still stuttered . He scratches his chin , his fingers trembling slightly . \u201c Well , I guess , um , it \u2019 s kind of hard to pity a vice president . It \u2019 s kind of hard to pity a senator who \u2019 s gotten six zillion awards . It \u2019 s kind of hard to pity someone who has had , you know , a decent family . I-I-I-I don \u2019 t think if , now , if someone sits and says , \u2018 Well , you know , the kid , when he was a stutterer , he must have been really basically stupid , \u2019 I-I-I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s hard to\u2014I \u2019 ve never thought of that . I mean , there \u2019 s nobody in the last , I don \u2019 t know , 55 years , has ever said anything like that to me . \u201d",
    "content_original": "His verbal stumbles have voters worried about his mental fitness. Maybe they\u2019d be more understanding if they knew he\u2019s still fighting a stutter.\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\nHis eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it. We\u2019ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes, and so far, every time he seems close, he backs away, or leads us in a new direction. There are competing theories in the press, but Joe Biden has kept mum on the subject. I want to hear him explain it. I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. \u201cI\u2014um\u2014I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Biden says. His voice has that familiar shake, the creak and the croak. \u201cI\u2019d have to see it. I-I-I don\u2019t remember.\u201d We\u2019re in Biden\u2019s mostly vacant Washington, D.C., campaign office on an overcast Tuesday at the end of the summer. Since entering the Democratic presidential-primary race in April, Biden has largely avoided in-depth interviews. When I first reached out, in late June, his press person was polite but noncommittal: Was an interview really necessary for the story?\n\nThen came the second debate, at the end of July, in Detroit. The first one, a month earlier, had been a disaster for Biden. He was unprepared when Senator Kamala Harris criticized both his past resistance to federally mandated busing and a recent speech in which he\u2019d waxed fondly about collaborating with segregationist senators. Some of his answers that night had been meander\u00ading and difficult to parse, feeding into the narrative that he wasn\u2019t just prone to verbal slipups\u2014he\u2019s called himself a \u201cgaffe machine\u201d\u2014but that his age was a problem, that he was confused and out of touch. Detroit was Biden\u2019s chance to regain control of the narrative. And then something else happened. The candidates were talking about health care. At first, Biden sounded strong, confident, presidential: \u201cMy plan makes a limit of co-pay to be One. Thousand. Dollars. Because we\u2014\u201d He stopped. He pinched his eyes closed. He lifted his hands and thrust them forward, as if trying to pull the missing sound from his mouth. \u201cWe f-f-f-f-further\n\nsupport\u2014\u201d He opened his eyes. \u201cThe uh-uh-uh-uh\u2014\u201d His chin dipped toward his chest. \u201cThe-uh, the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.\u201d Biden also stumbled when trying to say immune system. Fox News edited these moments into a mini montage. Stifling laughter, the host Steve Hilton narrated: \u201cAs the right words struggled to make that perilous journey from Joe Biden\u2019s brain to Joe Biden\u2019s mouth, half the time he just seemed to give up with this somewhat tragic and limp admission of defeat.\u201d\n\nSeveral days later, Biden\u2019s team got back in touch with me. One of his aides gingerly asked whether I\u2019d noticed the former vice president stutter during the debate. Of course I had\u2014I stutter, far worse than Biden. The aide said he was ready to talk about it. Recently, after Biden stumbled multiple times during the Atlanta debate, the topic became even more relevant. \u201cSo how are you, man?\u201d Biden is in his usual white button-down and navy suit, a flag pin on the left lapel. Up close, he looks like he\u2019s lost weight since leaving office in 2017. His height is commanding, but, as he approaches his 77th birthday, he doesn\u2019t fill out his suit jacket like he used to. I stutter as I begin to ask my first question. \u201cI\u2019ve only \u2026 told a few people I\u2019m \u2026 d-doing this piece. Every time I \u2026 describe it, I get \u2026 caught on the w-word-uh stuh-tuh-tuh-tutter.\u201d \u201cSo did I,\u201d Biden replies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u201d\u2014he interrupts himself\u2014\u201ccan\u2019t define who you are.\u201d\n\nMark Peckmezian\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden\u2019s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters\u2014\u00adif slightly\u2014on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I\u2019ve just heard. \u201cI want to ask you, as, you know, a \u2026 stutterer to, uh, to a \u2026 stutterer. When you were \u2026 talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to \u2026 my ear, my eye \u2026 did you have \u2026 trouble on s? Or on \u2026 m?\u201d\n\nBiden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. \u201cBut, you know, I haven\u2019t stuttered in so long that it\u2019s\n\nhhhhard for me to remember the specific\u2014\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat I do remember is the feeling.\u201d I started stuttering at age 4. I still struggle to say my own name. When I called the gas company recently, the automated voice apologized for not being able to understand me. This happens a lot, so I try to say \u201crepresentative,\u201d but r\u2019s are tough too. When I reach a human, I\u2019m inevitably asked whether we have a poor connection. Busy bartenders will walk away and serve someone else when I take too long to say the name of a beer. Almost every deli guy chuckles as I fail to enunciate my order, despite the fact that I\u2019ve cut it down to just six words: \u201cTurkey club, white toast, easy mayo.\u201d I used to just point at items on the menu. My head will shake on a really bad stutter. People have casually asked whether I have Parkinson\u2019s. I curl my toes inside my shoes or tap my foot as a distraction to help me get out of it, a behavior that I\u2019ve repeated so often, it\u2019s become a tic. Sometimes I shuffle a pen between my hands. When I was little, I used to press my palm against my forehead in an effort to force the missing word out of my brain. Back then, my older brother would imitate this motion and the accompanying sound, a dull whine\u2014something between a cow and a sheep. A kid at baseball camp, Michael, referred to me as \u201cStutter Boy.\u201d He\u2019d snap his fingers and repeat it as if calling a dog. \u201cStutter Boy! Stutter Boy!\u201d In college, I applied for a job at a coffee shop. I stuttered horribly through the interview, and the owner told me he couldn\u2019t hire me, because he wanted his caf\u00e9 to be \u201ca place where customers feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nStuttering is a neurological disorder that affects roughly 70 million people, about 3 million of whom live in the United States. It has a strong genetic component: Two-thirds of stutterers have a family member who actively stutters or used to. Biden\u2019s uncle on his mother\u2019s side\u2014\u201cUncle Boo-Boo,\u201d as he was called\u2014stuttered his whole life. In the most basic sense, a stutter is a repetition, prolongation, or block in producing a sound. It typically presents between the ages of 2 and 4, in up to twice as many boys as girls, who also have a higher recovery rate. During the develop\u00admental years, some children\u2019s stutter will disappear completely without intervention or with speech therapy. The longer someone stutters, however, the lower the chances of a full recovery\u2014\u00adperhaps due to the decreasing plasticity of the brain. Research suggests that no more than a quarter of people who still stutter at 10 will completely rid themselves of the affliction as adults. \u201cMr. Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden, what\u2019s that word?,\u201d a nun asked Joe Biden in front of his seventh-grade classmates. The cultural perception of stutterers is that they\u2019re fearful, anxious people, or simply dumb, and that stuttering is the result. But it doesn\u2019t work like that. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in fourth grade and you have to stand up and recite state capitals. You know that Juneau is the capital of Alaska, but you also know that you almost always block on the j sound. You become intensely anxious not because you don\u2019t know the answer, but because you do know the answer, and you know you\u2019re going to stutter on it.\n\nStuttering can feel like a series of betrayals. Your body betrays you when it refuses to work in concert with your brain to produce smooth speech. Your brain betrays you when it fails to recall the solutions you practiced after school with a speech therapist, allegedly in private, later learning that your mom was on the other side of a mirror, watching in the dark like a detective. If you\u2019re a lucky stutterer, you have friends and family who build you back up, but sometimes your protectors betray you too. A Catholic nun betrayed Biden when he was in seventh grade. \u201cI think I was No. 5 in alphabetical order,\u201d Biden says. He points over my right shoulder and stares into the middle distance as the movie rolls in his mind. \u201cWe\u2019d sit along the radiators by the window.\u201d The office we\u2019re in is awash in framed memories: Biden and his family, Biden and Barack Obama, Biden in a denim shirt posing for InStyle. The shelf behind the desk features, among other books, Jon Meacham\u2019s The Soul of America. It\u2019s a phrase Biden has adopted for his campaign this time around, his third attempt at the presidency. In almost every speech, Biden warns potential voters that 2020 is not merely an election, but a battle \u201cfor the soul of America.\u201d Sometimes he swaps in nation.\n\nJoe Biden: \u2018We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation\u2019 But now we\u2019re back in middle school. The students are taking turns reading a book, one by one, up and down the rows. \u201cI could count down how many paragraphs, and I\u2019d memorize it, because I found it easier to memorize than look at the page and read the word. I\u2019d pretend to be reading,\u201d Biden says. \u201cYou learned early on who the hell the bullies were,\u201d he tells me later. \u201cYou could tell by the look, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d For most stutterers, reading out loud summons peak dread. A chunk of text that may take a fluent person roughly a minute to read could take a stutterer five or 10 times as long. Four kids away, three kids away. Your shoulders tighten. Two away. The back of your neck catches fire. One away. Then it happens, and the room fills with secondhand embarrassment. Someone breathes a heavy sigh. Someone else laughs. At least one kid mimics your stutter while you\u2019re actively stuttering. You never talk about it. At night, you stare at the ceiling above your bed, reliving it. \u201cThe paragraph I had to read was: \u2018Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentleman. He laid his cloak upon the muddy road suh-suh-so the lady wouldn\u2019t soil her shoes when she entered the carriage,\u2019 \u201d Biden tells me, slightly and unintentionally tripping up on the word so. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man who\u2014\u2019 and then the nun said, \u2018Mr. Biden, what is that word?\u2019 And it was gentleman that she wanted me to say, not gentle man. And she said, \u2018Mr. Buh-Buh-Buh-Biden, what\u2019s that word?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBiden says he rose from his desk and left the classroom in protest, then walked home. The family story is that his mother, Jean, drove him back to school and confronted the nun with the made-for-TV phrase \u201cYou do that again, I\u2019ll knock your bonnet off your head!\u201d I ask Biden what went through his mind as the nun mocked him. \u201cAnger, rage, humiliation,\u201d he says. His speech becomes staccato. \u201cA feeling of, uh\u2014like I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced\u2014it just drops out of your chest, just, like, you feel \u2026 a void.\u201d He lifts his hands up to his face like he did on the debate stage in July, to guide the v sound out of his mouth: void. By all accounts, Biden was both popular and a strong athlete in high school. He was class president at Archmere Academy, in Claymont, Delaware. His nickname was \u201cDash\u201d\u2014not a reference to his speed on the football field, but rather another way to mock his stutter. \u201cIt was like Morse code\u2014dot dot dot, dash dash dash dash,\u201d Biden says. \u201cEven though by that time I started to overcome it.\u201d I ask him to expand on the relationship between anger and humiliation, or shame. \u201cShame is a big piece of it,\u201d he says, then segues into a story about meeting a stutterer while campaigning. I bring it back up a little later, this time more directly: \u201cWhen have you felt shame?\u201d \u201cNot for a long, long, long time. But especially when I was in grade school and high school. Because that\u2019s the time when everything is, you know, it\u2019s rough. They talk about \u2018mean girls\u2019? There\u2019s mean boys, too.\u201d\n\nBill Bowden had the locker next to Biden\u2019s at Archmere. I called Bowden recently. \u201cIt was just kind of a funny thing, you know?\u201d he told me. \u201cHopefully he wasn\u2019t hurt by it.\u201d Bob Markel, another high-school buddy of Biden\u2019s, went a little further when we spoke: \u201c \u2018H-H-H-H-Hey, J-J-J-J-J-Joe B-B-B-B-Biden\u2019\u2014that\u2019s how he\u2019d be addressed.\u201d Markel said the Archmere guys called him \u201cStutterhead,\u201d or \u201cHey, Stut !\u201d for short. He fears that he himself may have made fun of Biden once or twice. \u201cI never remember him being offended. He probably was,\u201d Markel said. \u201cI think one of his coping mechanisms was to not show it.\u201d Bowden and Markel have remained friends with Biden to this day. Before collecting from customers on his paper route, Biden would preplay conversations in his mind, banking lines\u2014a tactic he still sometimes uses on the campaign trail, he says. \u201cI knew the one guy loved the Phillies. And he\u2019d asked me about them all the time. And I knew another person would ask me about my sister, so I would practice an answer.\u201d After trying and failing at speech therapy in kinder\u00adgarten, Biden waged a personal war on his stutter in his bedroom as a young teen. He\u2019d hold a flashlight to his face in front of his bedroom mirror and recite Yeats and Emerson with attention to rhythm, searching for that elusive control. He still knows the lines by heart: \u201cMeek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views, which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon were only young men in libraries, when they wrote these books.\u201d\n\nBiden performs the passage for me with total fluency, knowing where and when to pause, knowing how many words he can say before needing a breath. This is what stutterers learn to do: reclaim control of their airflow; think in full phrases, not individual words. I ask Biden what his moment of dread used to be in that essay. \u201cWell, looking back on it, \u2018Meek young men grow up in li-li-libraries,\u2019 \u201d he begins again. \u201c \u2018Li\u2019\u2014the l.\u201d \u201cThat kind of sound, the l sound, is like the \u2026 r sound,\u201d I say. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve noticed, watching old clips, it looks like you do have a little trouble on the r. It\u2019s your middle initial.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cLike \u2018ruh-ruh-ruh-remember,\u2019 \u201d I say, intentionally stuttering on the r. \u201cWell, I may. I-I-I-I-I haven\u2019t thought I have. But I-I-I-I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s probably ways people could pick up that there\u2019s something. But I don\u2019t consciously think of it anymore.\u201d Biden says he hasn\u2019t felt himself caught in a traditional stutter in several decades. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t remember a time where I\u2019ve ever worried before a crowd of 80,000 people or 800 people or 80 people\u2014I haven\u2019t had that feeling of dread since, I guess, speech class in college,\u201d he says, referring to an under\u00adgraduate public-speaking course at the University of Delaware. This is when I ask him what happened that night in Detroit. After saying he doesn\u2019t remember, Biden opines: \u201cI\u2019m everybody\u2019s target; they have to take me down. And so, what I found is\u2014not anymore\u2014I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s difficult to deal with some of the criticism, based on the nature of the person directing the criticism. It\u2019s awful hard to be, to respond the same way in a national debate\u2014especially when you\u2019re, you know, the guy who is characterized as the white-guy-of-\u00adprivilege kind of thing\u2014to turn and say to someone who says, \u2018I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a racist, but \u2026\u2019 and know you\u2019re being set up. So I have to admit to you, I found my mind going, What the hell? How do I respond to that? Because I know she\u2019s being completely unfair.\u201d\n\nI eventually realize that he\u2019s describing the moment from the first debate, when Harris criticized his record on race. \u201cThese aren\u2019t debates,\u201d he continues. \u201cThese are one-minute assertions. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who hasn\u2019t been taking shots at me, which is okay. I\u2019m a big boy, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy. I can only speculate as to why Biden\u2019s campaign agreed to this interview, but I assume the reasoning went something like this: If Biden disclosed to me, a person who stutters, that he himself still actively stutters, perhaps voters would cut him some slack when it comes to verbal misfires, as well as errors that seem more related to memory and cognition. But whenever I asked Biden about what appeared to be his present-day stuttering, the notably verbose candidate became clipped, or said he didn\u2019t remember, or spun off to somewhere new. I wondered if I reminded Biden of his old self, a ghost from his youth, the stutterer he used to be. He and I are about the same height. We happened to be wearing the exact same outfit that day: navy suit, white shirt, no tie. We both went to all-male prep schools, the sort of place where displaying any weakness is a liability. As I listened to the recording of our interview, I remembered how I used to respond when people asked me about my stutter. I\u2019d shut down. I\u2019d try to change the subject. I\u2019d almost always look away.\n\nIn early September, I got in touch with my high-school speech pathologist, Joseph Donaher, who practices at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. I hadn\u2019t heard Donaher\u2019s voice for almost 15 years. Immediately, I was transported back to the little window\u00adless room in the hospital where we used to meet. Donaher was the first therapist\u2014\u00adreally the first person\u2014\u00adwho ever leveled with me. I can still see his face, the neutrality in his eyes on the day he looked at me square and said the sentence my friends and parents had avoided saying my entire life: You have a severe stutter. Donaher and his colleagues try to help their patients open up about the shame and low self-worth that accompany stuttering. Instead of focusing solely on mechanics, or on the ability to communicate, they first build up the desire to communicate at all. They then share techniques such as elongating vowels and lightly approaching hard-consonant clusters, meaning just touching on the first sound in a word like stutter\u2014the st\u2014to keep the mouth and throat from tensing up and interfering with speech. The goal isn\u2019t to be totally fluent but, simply put, to stutter better. This evolution in treatment has been accompanied by a new movement to destigmatize the disorder, similar to the drive to view autism through a lens of \u201cneuro\u00addiversity\u201d rather than as a pathology. The idea is to accept, even embrace, one\u2019s stutter. There are practical reasons for this: Research shows, according to Donaher, that the simple disclosure \u201cI stutter\u201d benefits both the stutterer and the listener\u2014the former gets to explain what\u2019s happening and ease the awkward tension so the latter isn\u2019t stuck wondering what\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d with this person. Saying those two words is harder than it seems. \u201cI\u2019m working with people who spend their whole lives and are never able to disclose it,\u201d Donaher told me. Biden says his father taught him about \u201cshouldering burdens with grace.\u201d Specifically, he told his son, \u201cNever complain. Never explain.\u201d Eric S. Jackson, an assistant professor of communicative sciences and dis\u00adorders at NYU, told me he believes that Biden\u2019s eye movements\u2014the blinks, the downward glances\u2014are part of his ongoing efforts to manage his stutter. \u201cAs kids we figure out: Oh, if I move parts of my body not associated with the speech system, sometimes it helps me get through these blocks faster,\u201d Jackson, a stutterer himself, explained. Jackson credits an intensive program at the American Institute for Stuttering, in Manhattan, with bringing him back from a \u201crock bottom\u201d period in his mid-20s, when he says his stutter kept him from meeting women or speaking up enough to reach his professional goals. Afterward, Jackson went all in on disclosure: Every day for six months, he stood up during the subway ride to and from work and announced that he was a person who stutters. \u201cI had this new relationship with my stuttering\u2014I was like Hercules,\u201d he told me. At 41, Jackson still stutters, but in conversation he confidently maintains eye contact and appears relaxed. He wishes Biden would be more transparent about his intermittent disfluency. \u201cRunning for president is essentially the biggest stage in the world. For him to come out and say \u2018I still stutter and it\u2019s fine\u2019 would be an amazing, empowering message.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, Biden has used present-tense verbs when discussing his stutter. \u201cI find myself, when I\u2019m tired, cuh-cuh-\u00adcatching myself, like that,\u201d he said during a 2016 American Institute for Stuttering speech. Biden has used the phrase we stutterers at times, but in most public appearances and interviews, Biden talks about how he overcame his speech problem, and how he believes others can too. You can watch videos posted by his campaign in which Biden meets young stutterers and encourages them to follow his lead. They\u2019re sweet clips, even if the underlying message\u2014\u00adbeat it or bust\u2014is out of sync with the normalization movement. Emma Alpern is a 32-year-old copy editor who co-leads the Brooklyn chapter of the National Stuttering Association and co-founded NYC Stutters, which puts on a day-long conference for stuttering de\u00adstigmatization. Alpern told me that she\u2019s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden, and that it\u2019s been \u201cfrustrating\u201d to watch the media portray Biden\u2019s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty. \u201cBiden allows that to happen by not naming it for what it is,\u201d she said, though she\u2019s not sure that his presidential candidacy would benefit if he were more forthcoming. \u201cI think he\u2019s dug himself into a hole of not saying that he still stutters for so long that it would strike people as a little weird.\u201d Biden has presented the same life story for decades. He\u2019s that familiar face\u2014Uncle Joe. He was born 11 months after Pearl Harbor and grew up in the last era of definitive \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys.\u201d He\u2019s the dependable guy, the tenacious guy, the aviators-and-crossed-arms guy. That guy doesn\u2019t stutter; that guy used to stutter.\n\n\u201cMy dad taught me the value of constancy, effort, and work, and he taught me about shouldering burdens with grace,\u201d Biden writes in the first chapter of his 2007 memoir, Promises to Keep. \u201cHe used to quote Benjamin Disraeli: \u2018Never complain. Never explain.\u2019 \u201d Stephen Colbert launches across the Ed Sullivan Theater stage, as if from a pinball spring. It\u2019s early September, and his Late Show taping is about to begin. To warm up, he takes a few questions from the studio audience. Someone asks what he\u2019d want in a potential new president. \u201cEmpathy?\u201d Colbert deadpans. \u201cA soul?\u201d Colbert tapes in Midtown Manhattan on the same stage where the Beatles made their American television debut 55 years ago, when Joe Biden was a mere 22. Biden struts out to a standing ovation and throws up his hands in amazement: For me? A brief \u201cJoe! Joe! Joe!\u201d chant erupts. At first, Colbert lobs softballs, and Biden touches on the key parts of his 2020 stump speech: Why voters must stand up to the existential threat of Trumpism and how the Charlottesville, Virginia, white-supremacist rally crystallized his decision to run. Then Colbert goes for it. \u201cIn the last few weeks, you\u2019ve confused New Hampshire for Vermont; said\n\nBobby Kennedy and MLK were assassinated in the late \u201970s; assured us, \u2018I am not going nuts.\u2019 Follow-up question: Are you going nuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show was because\u2014\u201d The audience howls. Biden flashes a flirty smile. Colbert adjusts his glasses, sticks his pen in his mouth, and nods in approval. The joke was probably canned, but Biden landed it. Colbert continues to press him about accuracy issues in his storytelling. The studio audience is silent; I\u2019m watching from the balcony and can hear the theater\u2019s air-conditioning humming overhead. \u201cI-I-I-I-I don\u2019t get wrong things like, uh, ya know, there is a, we, we should lock kids up in cages at the border. I mean, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d People applaud before Biden can finish. When the interview is over, Biden receives a second standing ovation. He peers up toward the rafters, using his hand as a visor against the bright lights. A white spotlight follows him offstage. Several minutes later, he glides through the stage door and out onto West 53rd Street. People call to him from the sidewalk. \u201cJoe! Joe Biden!\u201d He climbs into the back of an idling black SUV, and the doors\n\nclunk close. Read: Tyranny of the 70-Somethings I follow Biden for a couple of days while he campaigns in New Hampshire. His town halls have a distinctly Norman Rockwell vibe. One takes place in the middle of the day on the third floor of a former textile mill, another on a stretch of grass as the wind whips off the Piscataqua River. His crowds are predominantly older, filled with people who stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and wait patiently to ask questions. After he speaks, Biden typically walks offstage to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cWe Take Care of Our Own,\u201d then saunters down the rope line for handshakes and hugs and selfies. One voter after another tells me they\u2019re unaware of Biden\u2019s stutter. \u201cKnowing that he has had something like that to deal with and overcame it, as well as other really sad things that have happened\u2014\u00ad\u00adit just makes me like him more,\u201d says 70-year-old Grace Payne.\n\nBack in New York, I start to wonder if I\u2019m forcing Biden into a box where he doesn\u2019t belong. My box. Could I be jealous that his present stutter is less obvious than mine? That he can go sentences at a time without a single block or repetition? Even the way I\u2019m writing this piece\u2014\u00adkeeping Biden\u2019s stammers, his ums and pauses, on the page\u2014seems hypocritical. Here I am highlighting the glitches in his speech, when the journalistic courtesy, convention even, is to edit them out. I spend weeks watching Biden more than listening to him, trying to \u201ccatch him in the act\u201d of stuttering on camera. There\u2019s one. There\u2019s one. That was a bad one. Also, I start stuttering more. In September, before the third Democratic debate, in Houston, I called Michael Sheehan, a Washington, D.C.\u2013area communications coach whose company website boasts clients ranging from Nike to the Treasury Department. Sheehan worked with President Bill Clinton while he was in office and began consulting on and off for Biden in 2002, when he was in the Senate. On the day we spoke, he was in Wilmington, Delaware, doing debate prep with Biden. Sheehan and I traded stories of daily indignities\u2014\u00ad\u00adhe stutters too. \u201cI remember exactly where the deli was; it was on 71st and First Avenue,\u201d he said with an ache in his voice. He lamented the interventionists, the people who volunteer, \u201c \u2018You know, why don\u2019t you speak more slowly?\u2019 I always want to say \u2018Holy shit! Why didn\u2019t I think of that? Thank you!\u2019 \u201d\n\nSheehan\u2019s own stutter improved, but didn\u2019t fully go away, when he took up speech and debate in high school. This eventually led him to the theater, which is a common, if surprising, place where some stutterers find that they\u2019re able to speak with relative ease. Taking on a character, another voice, the theory goes, relies on a different neural pathway from the one used in conversation. Many successful actors have battled stutters\u2014Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, James Earl Jones. In 2014, Jones, whose muscular baritone is the bedrock of one of the most quoted lines in film history, told NPR that he doesn\u2019t use the word cured to describe his apparent fluency. \u201cI just work with it,\u201d he said. At an August town hall, Biden briefly blocked on Obama, before subbing in my boss. The headlines afterward? \u201cBiden Forgets Obama\u2019s Name.\u201d Sheehan was extremely careful with the language he used to describe Biden\u2019s speech patterns\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s a stutter\u201d\u2014\u00adthough he noted his friend\u2019s habit of abruptly changing directions mid-sentence. \u201cI do hear those little pauses, but I really don\u2019t hear the stuff that you would hear from me or I would hear from you,\u201d he said. A few minutes into our conversation, he choked up while discussing Biden\u2019s tender\u00adness toward young stutterers. \u201cSometimes I feel when he goes a little long on a speech, he\u2019s just making up for lost time, you know?\u201d Sheehan told me about a night when he came home with his wife and saw the answering-\u00admachine light blinking: \u201cHey, Michael, it\u2019s Joe Biden. I just was watching The King\u2019s Speech with my granddaughter, and I just thought I\u2019d give you a call, because it made me think of you. Goodbye!\u201d He says the message felt like a secret fraternity handshake: \u201cYou and I have both been there, and only people in that society know what that is about.\u201d\n\nIn Biden\u2019s office, the first time I bring up his current stuttering, he asks me whether I\u2019ve seen The King\u2019s Speech. He speaks almost mystically about the award-winning 2010 film. \u201cWhen King George VI, when he stood up in 1939, everyone knew he stuttered, and they knew what courage it took for him to stand up at that stadium and try to speak\u2014and it gave them courage \u2026 I could feel that. It was that sinking feeling, like\u2014oh my God, I remember how you felt. You feel like, I don\u2019t know \u2026 almost like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole.\u201d Presidential candidates usually don\u2019t speak about their bleakest moments, certainly not this viscerally. It resembles the way Biden writes in his memoir about the aftermath of the 1972 car accident that killed his first wife and young daughter and critically injured his two sons, Beau and Hunter: \u201cI could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest, like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.\u201d Related Stories Joe Biden Is Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Candidate\n\nIs Joe Biden \u2018Too Old\u2019?\n\nThe President\u2019s Cognitive Decline A few weeks later, I ask Jill Biden what she remembers about sitting next to her husband during the movie. \u201cIt was one of those moments in a marriage where you just sort of understand without words being spoken,\u201d she says. As he watched The King\u2019s Speech, Biden accurately guessed that the screenwriter, David Seidler, was a stutterer. \u201cHe showed me a copy of a speech they found in an attic that the king had actually used, where he marks his\u2014it\u2019s exactly what I do!\u201d Biden tells me, his voice lifting. \u201cMy staff, when I have them put something on a prompter\u2014I wish I had something to show you.\u201d\n\nHe pulls out a legal pad and begins drawing diagonal lines a few inches apart, as if diagramming invisible sentences: x words, breath, y words, breath. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just the way I have\u2014the, the best way for me to read a, um, a speech. I mean, when I saw The King\u2019s Speech, and the speech\u2014I didn\u2019t know anybody who did that!\u201d Biden is running for president on a simple message: America is not Trump. I\u2019m not Trump. I\u2019ll lead us out of this. With every new debate, with every new \u201cgaffe,\u201d the media continue to ask whether Biden has the stamina for the job. And with every passing month, his competitors\u2014namely Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2014have gained on him in the polls. A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy. Biden talks all day to audiences both small and large. In addition to periodically stuttering or blocking on certain sounds, he appears to intentionally not stutter by switching to an alternative word\u2014a technique called \u201ccircumlocution\u201d\u2014\u00adwhich can yield mangled syntax. I\u2019ve been following practically everything he\u2019s said for months now, and sometimes what is quickly characterized as a memory lapse is indeed a stutter. As Eric Jackson, the speech pathologist, pointed out to me, during a town hall in August Biden briefly blocked on Obama, before quickly subbing in my boss. The headlines after the event? \u201cBiden Forgets Obama\u2019s Name.\u201d Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought, it seems unrelated to stuttering, like he\u2019s just making a mistake. The kind of mistake other candidates make too, though less frequently than he does.\n\nDuring his 2016 address at the American Institute for Stuttering, Biden told the room that he\u2019d turned down an invitation to speak at a dinner organized by the group years earlier. \u201cI was afraid if people knew I stuttered,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have thought something was wrong with me.\u201d Yet even when sharing these old, hard stories, Biden regularly characterizes stuttering as \u201cthe best thing that ever happened\u201d to him. \u201cStuttering gave me an insight I don\u2019t think I ever would have had into other people\u2019s pain,\u201d he says. I admire his empathy, even if I disagree with his strict adherence to a tidy redemption narrative. In Biden\u2019s office, as my time is about to run out, I bring up the fact that Trump crudely mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the 2016 campaign. \u201cSo far, he\u2019s called you \u2018Sleepy Joe.\u2019 Is \u2018St-St-St-Stuttering Joe\u2019 next?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Biden says, \u201cbecause if you ask the polls \u2018Does Biden stutter? Has he ever stuttered?,\u2019 you\u2019d have 80 to 95 percent of people say no.\u201d If Trump goes there, Biden adds, \u201cit\u2019ll just expose him for what he is.\u201d I ask Biden something else we\u2019ve been circling: whether he worries that people would pity him if they thought he still stuttered. He scratches his chin, his fingers trembling slightly. \u201cWell, I guess, um, it\u2019s kind of hard to pity a vice president. It\u2019s kind of hard to pity a senator who\u2019s gotten six zillion awards. It\u2019s kind of hard to pity someone who has had, you know, a decent family. I-I-I-I don\u2019t think if, now, if someone sits and says, \u2018Well, you know, the kid, when he was a stutterer, he must have been really basically stupid,\u2019 I-I-I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to\u2014I\u2019ve never thought of that. I mean, there\u2019s nobody in the last, I don\u2019t know, 55 years, has ever said anything like that to me.\u201d",
