But speech is now under a sustained assault not seen since the 1798 Sedition Act saw more than 20 newspaper editors jailed by President John Adams .\nBecause Abrams covers only the First Amendment , he ignores the Court \u2019 s seminal Bill of Rights case prior to 1925 , the year the Supreme Court began to selectively incorporate clauses , thus applying them to the States . Until then the case that defined its ambit was Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) , in which Chief Justice John Marshall , our most influential Justice , authored the Court \u2019 s opinion holding that the Bill of Rights limited only the powers of the federal government .

This view is widely held because the Constitution \u2019 s text focuses on definition and distribution of powers , many arcane to non-lawyers ; the first ten amendments collectively called the Bill of Rights is a charter that mostly defines substantive constitutional rights , to many our secular Ten Commandments .\nAbrams offers six chapters : ( 1 ) the history of free speech and the First Amendment over the past 226 years ; ( 2 ) comparison of free speech protection between America and the other Western democracies ; ( 3 ) how English free speech law was explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court in a landmark decision ; ( 4 ) comparison of relative protection of a right to be forgotten ; ( 5 ) comparison of regulation of spending in political campaigns ; ( 6 ) free speech issues that evade legislative and jurisprudential solution .\nAbrams notes two emerging , divergent views on free speech protections . Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent as to free speech protection in the landmark 2010 Citizens United decision : \u201c The First Amendment advances not only the individual \u2019 s right to engage in political speech , but also the public \u2019 s interest in preserving democratic order in which collective speech matters. \u201d ( Italics in original . ) As rebuttal , Abrams cited Chief Justice Roberts in a later election free speech case , that \u201c \u2026 the will of the majority\u2026 plainly can include laws that restrict free speech .
