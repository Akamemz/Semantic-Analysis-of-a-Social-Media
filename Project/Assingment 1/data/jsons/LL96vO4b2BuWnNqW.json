    "content": "According to numerous scholars who have weighed in since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia over the weekend , historical and constitutional precedent indicates that the president of the United States is elected for a four-year term , and does not stop being president until he or she , um , actually leaves office . That \u2019 s a hot take on a controversial topic , I know ! It \u2019 s nearly as confusing as the question of who was president at the time of the 9/11 attacks , which Marco Rubio seems to think took place during some extended Bill Clinton prequel to \u201c The Hangover , \u201d while George W. Bush wore funny costumes and did non-alcoholic Jell-O shots and kept forgetting he had taken the oath of office .\nBut history \u2019 s bunk , as Henry Ford sorta , kinda said nearly a century ago . And so is reality , at least when it comes to politics in 2016 , a year whose revolutionary strangeness demands a new descriptive term . \u201c Postmodern \u201d is way too old-fashioned , too \u2018 90s . Our politics are increasingly post-partisan , post-rational , post-factual and even post-political . Even the New York Times has noticed . In a story published Tuesday about the running battle over judicial appointments between the Obama administration and the Republican leadership of the Senate , reporter Charlie Savage wonderingly observed that \u201c history is no longer a guide in a polarized Washington , where partisan warfare over judicial nominations has been escalating for more than a generation . \u201d\nThat qualifies as what Friedrich Nietzsche would have called a \u201c daybreak \u201d moment , the dawning of a new awareness . ( I agree that I quote him too much ; that \u2019 s it for now . ) Please notice the inherent contradiction in Savage \u2019 s sentence : \u201c History \u201d is no longer a guide because it is no longer history , that is , because the lessons that a mainstream commentator is supposed to draw from history no longer reflect what has actually happened . The Republican Party \u2019 s long-term strategy of paralysis , refusal and denial \u2014 of crushing all lingering vestiges of democracy under a sodden weight of nihilism and apathy \u2014 is the new normal .\nThat strategy stretches back at least as far as the Bill Clinton years , and has gone into Koch-funded steroid overdrive in the Citizens United era . As its zillionaire funders clearly grasp , that strategy represents the GOP \u2019 s best hope for repeated midterm victories and a stranglehold on congressional power into the indefinite future . It \u2019 s the strategy that produced the Koch brothers \u2019 greatest single victory , to set against their more visible record of bankrolling losers like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush ( and , most likely , Marco Rubio ) . That victory was , of course , the 37 percent turnout in the 2014 midterms , when both Democrats and moderate Republicans stayed home in droves and the GOP won its largest congressional majority since 1931 .\nSo I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s quite right to describe the Republican leadership \u2019 s vow to reject any possible Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Obama during his last year in office as unprecedented or particularly surprising . It \u2019 s useless to talk about precedent as if that word meant something these days , for starters . There is no relevant precedent for anything happening in American politics right now , except perhaps for some limited parallels one could identify in the severely divided nation of the 1850s , on the cusp of the Civil War .\nAs far as surprise goes , give me a break . Do I take a cynical view of all the expressions of amazement and righteous indignation from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and every other leading Democrat and the entire leftward half of the commentariat ? Sure I do : They sense political opportunity and the chance to shoot a flattering selfie with the Constitution behind them . Which is fair play and all , but let \u2019 s not mistake it for high-minded principle . It might be fair to give Sanders an asterisk on this one , but the Democratic Party as a whole has been a junior partner or fellow traveler in the politics of paralysis , and has done virtually nothing to resist it .\nIt \u2019 s no secret that the current Republican leadership in Congress is essentially held hostage by the most extreme elements of its base . We have all forgotten about John Boehner , for understandable reasons , but please remember that the duly elected speaker of the House was forced to quit for being not enough of a do-nothing obstructionist . For any elected Republican to offer a fair hearing to any Obama nominee at any level of government is tantamount to treason ; half the Republican electorate apparently believes that Obama is not a United States citizen and not the lawful president in the first place . What proportion of them believes that Obama had Scalia murdered in order to ban all guns , open the borders and institute Sharia law remains unclear . ( \u201c I \u2019 m hearing it \u2019 s a big topic , \u201d says Donald Trump , fueling a new bump in the polls . ) And here we are , facing a Supreme Court vacancy after the death of the most conservative justice in recent history \u2014 or ever , quite likely \u2014 under the aforementioned lame-duck Islamo-Democratic so-called president .\nWhether the Republicans can successfully run out the clock on the Obama administration without paying a devastating political price remains to be seen . It \u2019 s a massive gamble , a game of Russian roulette played with four or five bullets in a six-shooter . But their vow to do so is the logical fulfillment of their party \u2019 s long-term commitment to paralysis as politics , and it comes as a surprise to absolutely nobody in Washington . If that tactic poses unknowable hazards for the GOP in general and its presidential nominee in particular , that \u2019 s not because it is qualitatively different from what they \u2019 ve been doing for years . It \u2019 s only because it thrusts the nihilistic strategy of the right-wing conserva-trolls who have eaten the Republican Party \u2019 s soul into the public \u2019 s face in blatant and unavoidable fashion .\nHonestly , it was more surprising to hear Sen.

Once upon a time , Grassley came off as a right-wing zealot among Senate Republicans . Now he \u2019 s a congenial bipartisan man of reason , not to mention an 82-year-old incumbent who faces a tough reelection fight in a purple state that Obama carried twice . Let \u2019 s not waste any compassion on Grassley , because he deserves to ride the slippery slide of ignominy however that happens . But I feel sorry for the folks who are fielding all the outraged phone calls in his Capitol Hill office right now . I don \u2019 t know whether it \u2019 s too late for some Tea Party firebrand to mount a Republican primary challenge in Iowa , but I guarantee that question is being pondered right now .\nIt \u2019 s tempting to express delight at the current GOP dilemma , where Republicans would seem to face death by fire from the pitchfork-bearing faithful if they move forward with an Obama Supreme Court nominee , and death in the frigid ocean of a national election if they don \u2019 t . It \u2019 s tempting if you \u2019 re wearing ideological blinders , that is , and if you assume that the Democratic Party , even in its divided and eviscerated state , is guaranteed to reap a glorious victory after a lemming-like wave of Republican mass suicide . I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s a safe assumption .\nOur entire bipartisan political system is in dire and potentially terminal condition , and as I keep insisting there are ample reasons to believe that the virus that has destroyed one party has also infected the other , albeit in less dramatic fashion . We \u2019 re already in a year when the Republicans seem likely to nominate a lunatic demagogue who is despised by the entire party leadership \u2014 and who , whatever he is , is not a \u201c conservative \u201d by anyone \u2019 s definition \u2014 and when a septuagenarian Jewish socialist is one or two victories away from being the Democratic front-runner . What will come of Obama \u2019 s impending Supreme Court nomination , and who will inherit the resulting mess next January ? I have no idea .
