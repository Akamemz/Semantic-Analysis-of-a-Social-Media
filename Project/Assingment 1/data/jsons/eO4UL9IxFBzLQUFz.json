    "content": "On Stephen Colbert 's CBS late night show , the host challenged Elizabeth Warren on the issue of single-payer healthcare , which she unequivocally supports . He attempted to nail the leftist Senator down on the question of whether or not middle class Americans ' taxes would have to go up ( they would , a lot ) in order to fund the program she and Bernie Sanders have proposed . She ducked , he drilled down further , then she ducked again -- prompting the comedian to call her out on it , seemingly to her surprise :\n\u201c You keep being asked in the debates , how are you going to pay for it ? Are you going to raise the middle class taxes ? \u201d Colbert said .\nAfter a comic pause , Colbert asked \u201c How are you going to pay for it ? Are you going to raise the middle class taxes ? \u201d\n\u201c So here \u2019 s how we \u2019 re going to do this , \u201d Warren said , launching into her familiar response . \u201c Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans , for big corporations\u2026 \u201d\n\u201c Taxes which is what you mean by \u2018 costs \u2019 ? \u201d Colbert interrupted .\n\u201c Yes . And hardworking middle-class family are going to see their cost goes down\u2026 \u201d Warren continued .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s the thing , \u201d Warren began , but Colbert cut her off again .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s the thing , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve listened to these answers a few times before , and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes , perhaps , you \u2019 re not mentioning in your sentence . \u201d\nThis is about as hostile as it gets for a Democrat on national entertainment television , and Colbert immediately pivoted to offering Warren advice on how to make the argument in favor of middle class tax hikes for the greater good of single-payer healthcare . His critique , you see , came from a place of support and agreement ; he simply wants her to be the most effective leftist she can be . The political problem is that coming out and saying , `` yes , we 're going to raise all of your taxes a lot , but it 'll be worth it '' is highly politically risky . To wit :\nIf [ voters ] were told that a government-run system could lead to delays in getting care or higher taxes , support plunged to 26 percent and 37 percent , respectively . \u201c The issue that will really be fundamental would be the tax issue , \u201d said Robert Blendon , a professor at the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health who reviewed the poll . He pointed out that state single-payer efforts in Vermont and Colorado failed because of concerns about the tax increases needed to put them in place .\nThe other fundamental problem for Warren is that her plan would rip away private healthcare plans from nearly 180 million Americans , making such coverage illegal . At the last Democratic debate , Warren tried to brush this off by claiming that few Americans love their insurance companies . What many , many Americans do value quite strongly , however , is the coverage and providers they come to rely on . Polling underscores that reality , which is a massive political liability for single-payer advocates , who explicitly want to permanently uproot tens upon tens of millions of people from those existing arrangements :\nAccording to Gallup polling from late last year , 82 % of Democrats said the quality of health care they received was either good or excellent . A large majority , 71 % , believed their health care coverage was either good or excellent . Even when it comes to health care costs , 61 % of Democrats said were satisfied with what they paid in health care . The same poll also notes that the vast majority of all Americans are satisfied with the quality of their health care \u2013 rating it \u2018 excellent \u2019 or \u2018 good \u2019 ( 80 percent ) \u2013 and their level of coverage ( 69 percent ) .\nIn addition , a recent Kaiser poll recently found that 86 percent of Americans with private coverage were satisfied with it .
