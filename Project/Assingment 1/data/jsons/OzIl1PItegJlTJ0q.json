There is no indication that the plan \u2014 which is light on details \u2014 was ever put into action , but it offers a fresh example of the mindset around Russian efforts to sow discord in the U.S .\nOne aspect of the mindset it reveals is that ethno-nationalists think everyone else sees the world in ethno-nationalist terms .\nThere are roughly 47 million African-Americans in the United States .
