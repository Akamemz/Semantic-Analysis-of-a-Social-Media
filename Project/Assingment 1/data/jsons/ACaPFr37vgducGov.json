A major challenge in the region is finding candidates who can win high-profile races now that Republicans , who scored well in midterm elections earlier this month , dominate the leadership in state legislatures and across statewide offices .\nGeorgia Democrats thought legacy candidates were the answer . But Senate hopeful Michelle Nunn , former Sen. Sam Nunn 's daughter , and gubernatorial challenger Jason Carter , former President Jimmy Carter 's grandson , each fell short by about 8 percentage points despite well-funded campaigns and ambitious voter-registration drives .\nArkansas Democrats lost an open governor 's seat and two-term Sen.
