    "content": "The current conventional wisdom percolating across the media is that Marco Rubio may be finished . His Super Tuesday showing was mediocre at best , his flu-addled debate performance paled in comparison to Cruz 's , his Saturday vote totals were ugly , and some polls show him fading into last place in Michigan . Beyond all that , there are tough questions being raised about his team 's underperforming strategy and organization . On the other hand , Rubio has notched two primary/caucus wins within the last week , carrying Minnesota by double digits -- and dominating in Puerto Rico , sweeping its 23 bound delegates . His favorable rating among Republicans ( and voters generally ) remains much stronger than Cruz or Trump 's , and his polling average against Hillary Clinton is the best of the three . Still , another bad night tonight , or a dud of a debate in Miami on Thursday , would only fuel the burgeoning negative narrative . It 's broadly understood that if Rubio loses his home state of Florida to Donald Trump on March 15 , it 's all over for him . So how is that race shaping up ? We 've seen a number of polls showing the billionaire stomping the first-term Senator on his home turf by double-digits , but several new statewide surveys with tighter eligibility screens ( Florida is a closed primary , meaning that only registered Republicans may vote ) show a competitive , single-digit race .
