    "content": "Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg , a centrist billionaire who launched a White House bid after years of flirting with a run , and pledged to use his vast resources to unite Democrats and moderate Republicans against President Donald Trump has suspended his campaign and is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden .\nHis campaign was shaken by Biden \u2019 s resurgence and overwhelming victory in the South Carolina primary , which reignited the former vice president 's bid and led other moderate candidates to drop out of the race end endorse him in an effort to consolidate the primary vote and prevent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from clinching the party \u2019 s nomination . By Super Tuesday , it was clear that Bloomberg 's efforts to target the 15 contests in play in lieu of traditional campaigning methods of hitting the early voting states simply did not pay off in terms of netting the bulk of pledged delegates or the popular vote .\n\u201c Three months ago , I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump . Today , I am leaving the race for the same reason : to defeat Donald Trump \u2013 because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult , '' he wrote in a letter to supporters adding \u201c I \u2019 ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it .
