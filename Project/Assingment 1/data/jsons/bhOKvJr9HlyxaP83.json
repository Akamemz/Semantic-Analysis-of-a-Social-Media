The White House has eased off , saying the president did not intend to blame the intelligence community -- but also is disputing accusations from GOP lawmakers and intelligence officials that Obama simply ignored their ISIS warnings for months .\n`` It was n't for lack of information , we all knew about it for years , '' Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minn. , told Fox News on Wednesday . She claimed lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee , on which she sits , `` gave it to the administration and said , 'wake up , there 's something very serious happening . ' ''\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has been left in a difficult position , with Obama pointing at him in his `` 60 Minutes '' interview . In the interview , Obama said Clapper `` has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria .
