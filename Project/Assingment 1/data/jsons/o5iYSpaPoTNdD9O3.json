    "content": "President Donald Trump and Russia \u2019 s President Vladimir Putin during the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires , Argentina , November 30 , 2018 . ( Marcos Brindicci/Reuters )\nAfter Trump \u2019 s election , his opponents took a sudden dislike to the Russians they once saw as peace partners\nThe three-year-long effort to abort the Trump presidency \u2014 now culminating with a manipulated impeachment effort \u2014 has warped U.S. foreign policy toward Russia .\nFrom 2009 to 2014 , the Obama administration \u2019 s official policy ( \u201c reset \u201d ) was appeasement of Vladimir Putin \u2019 s autocratic Russia . Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fashioned a \u201c reset button \u201d outreach to Russia , framed as an antidote to the allegedly unnecessarily punitive policy toward Russia initiated by George W. Bush after the 2008 Russian war with Georgia over the fate of Ossetia . In those ancient days , progressives thought Putin had been treated poorly by the warmongering Bush , and were determined to blame Bush , not Putin , for deteriorating relations .\nOne of the strangest sights of Adam Schiff \u2019 s recent impeachment-inquiry hearings conducted under the auspices of the House Intelligence Committee was an array of witnesses who lambasted Trump \u2019 s current Ukrainian policy \u2014 especially his brief delay in sending lethal aid .\nYet many of those who testified from the State Department or the National Security Council \u2014 Fiona Hill , George Kent , William Taylor , Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman , and Marie Yovanovitch , in addition to the reports of anguish from the \u201c whistleblower \u201d \u2014 were in some capacity serving in government during the prior Obama administration when it denied all lethal aid in general , and in particular anti-tank Javelin missiles , to the Ukrainians .\nAs Ukrainian experts , they all knew that the Burisma hierarchy was corrupt , that Hunter Biden had no qualifications to serve on its board , that his position was predicated on leveraging his father \u2019 s vice presidency , and that Joe Biden , as point man on Ukraine , had interfered in Ukrainian politics and fired a key prosecutor , who at least claimed he was looking into Hunter Biden and Burisma .\nSo why did none of them complain then about Obama \u2019 s timidity and the damage it caused the Ukrainians when deprived of American weaponry , or at least go to the inspector general and report Biden \u2019 s quid pro quo pressure ? After all , it was the Obama administration that empowered Putin and denied Ukraine weapons .\nAll of the above in some way had input in just that policy . Did not more Ukrainians die in active fighting because of Obama \u2019 s refusal from 2014 to 2017 to send them any weapons than perished in 2019 from a few weeks \u2019 delay in some lethal aid on a more or less static front ?\nReset , remember , was a ridiculous assumption , beginning with its symbolic origins in Geneva with a pilfered red hotel Jacuzzi button emblazoned with the wrong Russian word , \u201c overcharge. \u201d American magnanimity supposedly would be appreciated by a liberalizing Russia . Putin \u2019 s hierarchy would reciprocate with domestic reforms , thus lessening tensions between Moscow and Washington . No doubt the more Putin saw the munificence of Western liberality , the more he too would adopt progressive policies .\nIn truth , as is the way of all appeasement , it was a one-way street in which generosity was seen as weakness to be exploited . Obama lifted prior sanctions . He refused to send lethal aid to Ukraine . He abandoned missile-defense efforts in Eastern Europe on promises that Putin would not discredit his controversial reset policy during Obama \u2019 s 2012 reelection . Both sides kept their quid pro quo promises . Under today \u2019 s new Democratic House standards , Obama would have been impeached in 2012 for that quid pro quo by the Republican-controlled Congress .\nObama ignored various Russian cyberattacks on the U.S. and its allies , and its interference in U.S. elections . The nadir of reset came with Moscow \u2019 s promise to help out in Syria if Secretary of State John Kerry would invite it into the Middle East to enforce U.N. efforts to stop Bashar Assad \u2019 s use of weapons of mass destruction .\nThe results were disastrous . A resuscitated Assad liquidated his opposition while his partner Hezbollah was given free rein in large swaths of Syria .\nPutin interpreted such appeasement as a green light to crack down on Russian dissidents . The weaker the concrete American response and the louder the abstract American human-rights lectures to Putin , the more Russia developed utter contempt for the United States . By February 2014 Putin had annexed Crimea . And by autumn Russia had invaded and de facto reincorporated eastern Ukraine . The Baltic states , in terror , looked for renewed NATO reassurances .\nAs the Obama administration ended , Russia was discussing lucrative energy deals with NATO member Germany and was the de facto Syria-Lebanon czar . A Russia energy company had acquired sizable sources of North American uranium and had utter disdain for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration , both of which had approved the sale after large Russian-related donations to the Clinton Foundation and a nice $ 500,000 honorarium for a characteristic Bill Clinton puff talk in Moscow .\nWhen Russian-related hackers began interfering in U.S. politics , Obama told Putin to \u201c cut it out \u201d and gave lectures to certain-sore-loser candidate Donald Trump to stop his whining about the fairness of the U.S. election process , which was assured to be immune from foreign tampering . The subtext was that Hillary would soon win in a landslide and an embittered Donald Trump should not blame his loss on her use of a British ex-spy and his phony dossier \u2019 s Russian bought sources .\nThen the unexpected , or rather the surreal , happened : Donald Trump got elected president , despite the best efforts of the hierarchies of the DOJ , CIA , and FBI to prevent that nightmare . How to explain that sure winner Hillary \u2014 with nearly triple the campaign funds , with all the expert pollsters , with the best and brightest techies , and with a toadyish media \u2014 blew a once gargantuan lead ?\nThus was born \u201c Russian collusion , \u201d the slur that Trump had colluded with Putin to harm Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign in exchange for a Russian free hand .\nRemember , had Clinton only won , the facts would have remained the same , but there would have been no slurs of \u201c Russian collusion \u201d \u2014 only a quick cleanup by an obsequious Comey , Brennan , and Clapper of any embarrassing vestigial smears still floating around DOJ , the FBI , or the CIA , or among the media in general .\nSuch a conspiracy theory was improbable and ironic , given that Hillary herself , through the use of at least three firewalls ( the Democratic National Committee , the Perkins Coie legal firm , and Fusion GPS ) , had hired a British subject named Christopher Steele to compile dirt on Donald Trump through the use of bought bogus Russian sources . Russia apparently wanted to cause chaos in 360-degree fashion in the hopes of seeding the sort of internal civil discord that we have suffered from the last three years . Trump himself during the campaign had pushed back against the passive-aggressive Obama Russian policy , which had gyrated from partnership with an angelic Putin to hatred of a satanic Putin .\nThe Russians soon became for progressives the exegesis of why Hillary lost , rather than her anemic campaign or near-toxic persona . The consequences of prior progressive appeasement were forgotten . Suddenly the Left saw a Russian under every American bed .\nBut if reset friendship and alliance with Putin had utterly failed and only empowered him , the other extreme , of demonization , was just as dangerous . Russia still possessed over 6,500 deliverable nuclear weapons , the world \u2019 s largest nuclear stockpile , and had once been a traditional triangulation foil to Chinese expansionism .\nSuch a Kissingerian policy of balancing China and Russia to our advantage was now lost . So chances were diminished of any common and opportunistic concern between the West and Orthodox Russia against Islamic terrorism . For Trump , to meet Putin was proof to the Resistance that he was , as James Clapper ridiculously put it , a \u201c Russian asset. \u201d To demonstrate Trump \u2019 s anti-Russian fides , to correct for reset appeasement , and to reestablish deterrence given Obama-era Russian brinksmanship , Trump soon embraced the most anti-Russian policies in memory .\nSanctions under Trump were amplified .

Trump jawboned Europe to back off from Russian energy deals as he accelerated American natural-gas exports . Trump reassured Eastern Europeans of U.S. commitments to NATO \u2019 s eastern flank . In the Middle East , Trump allowed U.S. forces to wipe out attacking Russian mercenaries . America enabled Israel to systematically diminish the armed forces of Russian allies such as Hezbollah inside Syria .\nIn sum , the United States and Russia , the world \u2019 s two largest nuclear powers , were now all but enemies .
