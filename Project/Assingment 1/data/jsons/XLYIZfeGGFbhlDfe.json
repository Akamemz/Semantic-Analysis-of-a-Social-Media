Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal , or it gets hit with Tariffs . It \u2019 s as simple as that - and everybody \u2019 s talking ! Remember , we are the \u201c piggy bank \u201d that \u2019 s being robbed . All will be Great ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 24 , 2018\nThe administration reportedly plans to give farmers $ 12 billion in emergency aid to cope with the fallout from the tariff regime , Politico first reported Tuesday . Farmers have been among those hit hardest under Trump \u2019 s protectionist trade agenda , as foreign countries levy tens of billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs largely on the American agricultural industry . China , Mexico , and Canada have responded to the Trump administration \u2019 s taxes on imported steel , aluminum , and electronics with taxes on American soybeans , dairy , pork , apples , and potatoes , as well as other US products .\nThe impact of tariffs on US agriculture is no joke . Prices for agricultural products like soybeans have dropped to a 10-year low since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on trade and aluminum earlier this year . And farmers across different markets have grown increasingly nervous about how their businesses will fare if the trade war continues .\nThe administration \u2019 s plan , which has yet to be formally released , would reportedly be aimed at stabilizing the agricultural industry through three programs :\nDirect financial assistance for farmers . A purchase and distribution program , where the government buys up surplus agricultural products and redistributes them for low-income food assistance . A trade promotion program .\nThe Washington Post reported that this stabilization package will use a Depression-era program that allows the government to borrow up to $ 30 billion from the Treasury without congressional approval .\nSome kind of fix for farmers has been in the works for quite some time . Rep. Mike Conaway ( R-TX ) , who chairs the House Agricultural Committee , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week that he was confident the administration would act to help farmers \u201c persevere \u201d through this period .\n\u201c The president has great agriculture advisers around him , and his public comments indicate that he understands this is troubling to the folks in the production of agriculture in Middle America , \u201d Conaway said . \u201c [ Agriculture Secretary ] Sonny Perdue has some tools that he \u2019 s working on to mitigate in some small way the impact the tariffs are having . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Trump appears steadfast in his tariff agenda . He has already threatened to tax foreign car imports ahead of trade talks with the European Union this week , and has been tweeting a very rosy picture of the tariffs \u2019 impact on the American economy .\n\u201c I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers , and will win ! \u201d he tweeted earlier this month .\nTrump \u2019 s tariffs have hit farmers the hardest . No one knows when this will end .\nTrump has been clear and consistent about his restrictionist trade agenda . The administration ended exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs for many US trade allies , including Canada , Mexico , and the EU , in May . Trump has imposed tariffs on an additional $ 34 billion worth of Chinese products . He \u2019 s threatening tariffs on a total of $ 500 billion of Chinese goods and a foreign car and auto parts import tax that would hit American trade alliances in Europe .\nPeople in the American agriculture industry know that if the administration continues to follow through on this , they \u2019 ll be the ones continuing to get hit .\nAgriculture has incredibly low barriers to trade , making the industry an easy target for retaliatory tariffs .
