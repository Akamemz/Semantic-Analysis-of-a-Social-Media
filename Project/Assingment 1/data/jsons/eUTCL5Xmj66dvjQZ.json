Barbara A.

She \u2019 s not about to vote against a bill her party negotiated . \u201d\nThe bill funds most basic government operations for the rest of the fiscal year , which lasts through September , but it funds the Homeland Security Department only through Feb. 27 .\nHouse Republican leaders , meanwhile , looked for a strong showing from rank-and-file members in the final vote . They expected as many as 40 defectors but aimed to cut that number to about 30 , saying they sense growing support for the leadership \u2019 s strategy to clear the decks this year and set up a major brawl over Mr. Obama \u2019 s immigration moves early next year , ahead of that February deadline .\n\u201c Without a threat of a government shutdown , this sets up a direct challenge to the president \u2019 s unilateral actions on immigration when we have new majorities in both chambers of Congress , \u201d House Speaker John A.
