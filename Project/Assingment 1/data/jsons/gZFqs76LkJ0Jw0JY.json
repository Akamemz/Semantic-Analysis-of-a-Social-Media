Again , '' Bend the Arc tweeted on July 1 .\nSeveral Facebook posts have noted the perceived similarities , as well . One user noted , `` Trump is now selling straight up nazi propaganda shirts . ''\n\u201c This is moronic . In Democrats \u2019 America , Mount Rushmore glorifies white supremacy and the bald eagle with an American flag is a Nazi symbol . They have lost their minds , '' Tim Murtaugh , Trump 2020 communications director , said in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nMurtaugh pointed out a similar situation with former House Speaker Paul Ryan . A BuzzFeed story notes that in January 2017 , Twitter was abuzz with the idea that the speaker 's logo resembled a similar Nazi eagle and swastika . But it also looks like the eagle-and-globe top of the silver mace of the House , `` a symbol of the House 's authority , '' according to the House website .\nThe eagle is one of the most common animals to be used in design throughout history , having been used as a symbol of empire and royalty since the first recorded civilizations . Eagles have been especially common in Western countries , where the birds often appear on the coat of arms and official documents of various countries .\nThe bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782 , according to the Library of Congress . The seal of the United States as well as the crests of many federal and state agencies frequently feature the eagle , often in consort with shields , crests and other objects .\n\u201c The Great Seal of America \u201d was developed in 1782 and features a right-facing eagle , though the bird \u2019 s talons are spread , one holding arrows , the other holding an olive branch .\n`` Only one authorized Great Seal is in official use and is operated by the U.S. Department of State . The Great Seal is impressed upon official documents such as treaties and commissions . The Department of State affixes about 3,000 seals to official documents yearly , '' according to the State Department 's website .\nThe president 's seal and many Cabinet-level offices have official seals that also incorporate an eagle as the central design .\nThe Mace of the Republic , a ceremonial symbol of the House of Representatives , is another high-profile example of eagle iconography in the U.S. government . In December 2019 , Speaker Nancy Pelosi wore a brooch of the mace during debate over impeachment . Pelosi has also worn the famous brooch on several other important political occasions including Trump 's first State of the Union , the New York Times reported .\n\u201c The silver mace , symbol of the House \u2019 s authority , has been in use in the House since 1841 when the Members met in the old House Chamber \u2026 A silver globe with an eagle perched on it sits at the top of the mace , with the Western Hemisphere facing front , \u201d an entry on the House of Representatives website reads .\nAnother famous example of the eagle in American culture is the Eagle , Globe and Anchor of the Marine Corps . The seal , which includes the Marines \u2019 Latin motto \u201c Semper Fidelis \u201d meaning \u201c Always faithful , \u201d has been used in some form since the 1800s .\nThe Nazi eagle was developed by the German Nazi Party in Germany in the 1920s , and became a symbol of the government after the party took power . It was derived from the German coat of arms .\nThe Reichsadler , which translates to \u201c Imperial Eagle , \u201d was derived from the Holy Roman Empire \u2019 s coat of arms .\n`` A regulation issued in 1936 defined a swastika framed by a wreath of oak leaves , topped by an open-winged and right-facing eagle , as the sovereign symbol of the Reich , '' according to the German parliament 's website .\nThe coat of arms was changed after 1945 to remove the swastika and other adornments .
