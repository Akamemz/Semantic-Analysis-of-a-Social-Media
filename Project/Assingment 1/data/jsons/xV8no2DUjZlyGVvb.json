    "content": "German Lopez : You 've called the war on drugs a failure . What did you mean by that ?\nCory Booker : The bedrock values of our country \u2014 ideals of equal justice under the law , or liberty and justice for all \u2014 should be elevated through our criminal justice system . We need to keep people safe and secure . That is in fact why , for mutual defense , our country was formed .\nBut we 've compromised those values severely during this so-called drug war \u2014 so severely that we 're actually inhibiting public safety . We 're consuming gross amounts of taxpayer dollars . We are undermining human potential . And we 're doing it all in a way that has a significant , if not savage , disparate impact on poor people and minorities .\nThat , to me , is a failure . When we can get the same aims but also save taxpayer dollars , create greater safety than we 're experiencing right now , elevate human life and human potential , and not further cement racial disparities in this country but alleviate them , then we should be going in a dramatically different direction with drug policy reform . Pilot programs for prison reentry , and entire states like Georgia \u2014 which is dramatically lowering its African-American prison population , saving taxpayer dollars , and driving down crime \u2014 are showing us that we could go a different way .\nGerman Lopez : One of those reforms we 're hearing a lot about nowadays is marijuana legalization . Do you support marijuana legalization ?\nCory Booker : Overall , drug policy has gone seriously awry and is offending our value system . And marijuana is one of those drugs that 's been almost pulled out of a category of other serious drugs , many of which are prescribed by doctors to deal with serious injuries \u2014 somehow this drug was pulled out , made a schedule 1 crime , and so vilified that it 's created classes of criminals amid otherwise law-abiding citizens . For example , a mother who has a sick child with seizures \u2014 which we can show , medically , that marijuana , without even its intoxicating element , could severely reduce , and benefit that child \u2014 right now that person 's behavior , if she 's getting that life-affirming drug , is going to be called criminal . If she goes into another state that may have legalized it or legalized it medically and comes back into a state that does n't , she 's trafficking drugs across state lines \u2014 a federal offense . I 'm one of those people who think our marijuana laws are way off the rails . We need to pull back and focus on things like legalizing medical marijuana ; supporting states like Alaska or Colorado or Washington that want to be incubators of reform ; and allowing scientists and medical researchers to test marijuana 's impact on people .\nGerman Lopez : You introduced a bill that would reschedule marijuana from schedule 1 to 2 and essentially legalize medical marijuana at the federal level . Do you think this bill goes far enough , or would you like to go further ?\nCory Booker : There 's this huge area I call incontrovertible common sense that we should be doing . Allowing doctors some really serious but dangerous drugs while somehow leaving marijuana off that list belies common sense and is , in my opinion , morally wrong , because of the opportunity the drug presents in meeting the urgent needs of patients in our country .\nWhat I 'm comfortable doing now is just saying , `` Hey , federal government , play catch-up here . Get into the zone we already know most Americans are comfortable in . '' And we 're going to stop criminalizing large segments of the country , we 're going to allow scientists to study it , and we 're not going to take law-abiding citizens who sell marijuana through dispensaries in the states that have legalized it and make criminals out of them .\nGerman Lopez : You mentioned the racial disparities and class disparities in the criminal justice system in general . This is n't a controversial subject when you ask criminal justice experts \u2014 they know there are these giant disparities . But it 's something you very rarely hear about from most members of Congress . Do you think the demographics of Congress \u2014 whiter , wealthier \u2014 tend to skew perspective on this issue ?\nCory Booker : To me , that 's not a productive line of inquiry . What I want to do is just have a conversation with my colleagues , no matter what their background , no matter what their party .\nYou have drug laws that are so severely , disparately enforced against some groups . Let 's take African Americans , for example : there 's no difference between black and white marijuana usage or sales , in fact . You go to college campuses and you 'll get white drug dealers . I know this from my own experience of growing up and going to college myself . Fraternity houses are not being raided by police at the level you see with communities in inner cities .\nSo equal usage of this drug , equal sale of this drug , but blacks are about 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it . African Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimums , more likely to get about 13 percent longer sentences . It 's created these jagged disparities in incarceration . In my state , blacks are about 13 to 14 percent of the population , but they make up over 60 percent of the prison population .\nRemember : the majority of people we arrest in America are nonviolent offenders . Now you 've got this disparity in arrests , but that creates disparities that painfully fall all along this system .\nFor example , when you get arrested for possession with intent to sell , you can do it in some neighborhoods where there are no public schools and it 's not as densely packed as an inner city . You do it in an inner city and now you 're within a school zone , so you 're facing even higher mandatory minimums . So when you face that and you get out from your longer term , now you 're 19 years old with a felony conviction , possession with intent to sell in a school zone .\nBut forget even all of that \u2014 if you just have a felony conviction for possession , what do you face now ? Thousands of collateral consequences that will dog you for all of your life . You ca n't get a Pell Grant . You ca n't get a business license . You ca n't get a job . You 're hungry ? You ca n't get food stamps . You need some place to live ? You ca n't even get public housing .\nWhat that does within our country , especially in these concentrated areas where we have massive numbers of men being incarcerated , is create a caste system in which people feel like there 's no way out . And we 're not doing anything as a society like we know we could do . There are tons of pilot programs that show if you help people coming back from a nonviolent offense lock into a job or opportunity , their recidivism rates go down dramatically . If you do n't help them , what happens is that , left with limited options , many people make the decision to go back to that world of narcotic sales .\nWhat 's more dangerous to society : someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of their own home , or someone going 30 miles over the speed limit , racing down a road in a community ? And yet that teenager who makes a mistake \u2014 doing something the last three presidents admitted to doing \u2014 now he has a felony conviction , because it 's more likely he 's going to get caught . And for the rest of his life , when he 's 29 , 39 , 49 , 59 , he 's still paying for a mistake he made as a teenager .\nThat 's not the kind of society I believe in , nor is it fiscally responsible . It 's undermining productivity . It 's undermining people 's ability to take care of their families . It 's locking in generational problems in poverty , or even limiting opportunities .\nThis is so wrong that those conversations I 'm having with conservatives as well as with Democrats are resonating . When you have people like Sen. Rand Paul talking about racial disparities in incarceration , when you have people like Grover Norquist standing up and talking about disparate racial impact of this problem , this convergence in understanding of fiscal conservatives , of Christian conservatives , of libertarians shows me that this is a time of great hope for our country .\nSo I 'm not going to question people 's motives . This is one of those issues , like the civil rights movement of the 1960s , where it should pull all Americans together to say enough is enough .\nGerman Lopez : It 's interesting to me how much you 've focused on this issue in your time in the Senate . Is there anything in your own life that pulled you to this issue ?\nCory Booker : When I was first elected to the Newark city council in 1998 , we held an expungement hearing . New Jersey has narrow expungement laws where some people after five years of a nonviolent offense can get their records expunged . The first time I held it , I was blown away : standing room only , people desperate to get a youthful mistake off of their records so they could finally plug back in .\nI went through 15 years of my life where every single day I would encounter good Americans who were being overly punished in a disproportionate way for a nonviolent drug offense , whose lives were being destroyed , who had desperation , desire , hunger just to have a shot at the American dream \u2014 yet a nonviolent drug offense was undermining their potential to contribute , to raise their kids , to have a decent life .\nThat 's just wrong . So every day that I 'm here , that echoes in my conscience and drives me forward .\nLet me even go a step further , because I alluded to this point but did n't make it clear enough : the violence in my community that 's driven by men who believe \u2014 and I think they 're wrong , but this is what they believe \u2014 that they have no fair shot in this country ; they made a mistake and they 've gone into a system that often turns them out worse than they went in , in terms of their proclivity for crime .\nWhen you take juveniles , like we do in this country , and put them in solitary confinement \u2014 other nations consider that torture \u2014 you hurt them and you scar them through your practices . You expose them for nonviolent crimes to often violent people . You expose them to gang activity .\nThen you throw them back on our streets . And you tell them , `` We 're not going to help you get a job . You want a roof over your head ? Forget it . In fact , if we catch you trespassing on public housing authority property , we 're going to take action against you . You 're going to get a Pell Grant , try to better yourself through education ? Sorry , you 're banned from getting a Pell Grant . ''\nWhat do people do when they feel trapped and cornered by society ? What I saw in my city was people getting more and more caught up in criminal activity . You can trace it way back to an early youthful offense that resulted not in us helping them , not in us intervening to empower them \u2014 but in taking children and abandoning them and saying , `` You made this mistake , and we 're going to punish you , and , by the way , that punishment is going to continue every day of your life . ''\nThink of the statistic when I was mayor . We found out that the murder victims in our city had an 85 percent chance of having been previously arrested an average of 10 times . Some people might take a statistic like that and say , `` Well , it shows these people are whatever . '' No .\nIf you want to judge a society , do n't judge it by the kid like me who grew up in an affluent neighborhood and was given great schooling . Judge it by how we treat all of our children .\nWhat does it say about a society when a kid makes a mistake , and we do n't surround him with opportunities that we know now work ? But no , we have this slippery slope of punishing teenagers for nonviolent offenses \u2014 things kids in the neighborhood where I grew up , in an affluent town , did a lot . But when these kids get caught , they begin a slippery slope into a system that often closes off their options and points them more toward crime than toward redemption . That 's unacceptable to me .\nSo I 've got a lot of missions here \u2014 to expand opportunity , empower people with education , make college more affordable \u2014 but dear god , I am driven every single day to end this nightmare that has made my nation singular in humanity for having more people behind bars for nonviolent offenses . And in terms of race and class , we now have a country that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850 .\nThis is haunting to me , especially because there 's another way . I do n't have to invent it ; I 'm not just asserting it . I know factually there 's another way because I know many red states with Republican governors are showing there 's a way to dramatically reduce the prison population . The governor of Georgia is bragging about a 20 percent reduction of African Americans in the criminal justice system . There are common-sense things we could be doing that we 're not doing because of a lack of urgency \u2014 and that 's unacceptable to me . I was taught as a kid , as Langston Hughes said so eloquently , `` There 's a dream in this land with its back against the wall . To save the dream for one , we must save the dream for all . ''\nGerman Lopez : We 've seen a lot of movement at the state level to reform the criminal justice system . At the federal level , we have n't seen that much in terms of legislation , even though this is often touted as a bipartisan issue . Why do you think it 's been so slow to get legislation moving ?\nCory Booker : Well , I 'm new to the Senate , and that 's what people tell me we are : a slow body . But I think you need more people pushing . And I 'm not talking about more senators . We 're getting a growing coalition .\nBut I 'm the X Generation . We grew up after the Civil Rights Movement . And I know I 'm here because of the outrageously righteous impatience of a whole lot of Americans from wildly different backgrounds \u2014 from religious folks to nonreligious folks , black folks to white folks , Christian folks to Muslim and Jewish folks , Latino folks , you name it . There was a wild sense of urgency to raise the consciousness of this country until this place could n't stop the change . I mean , Sen. Strom Thurmond did a 24-hour filibuster trying to stop civil rights legislation . And the pressure in this country to end an outrageous injustice , a savage injustice , led to change .\nTo me , this issue is no less urgent . In fact , in terms of affecting poor people and minorities and devastating communities , this is an urgent issue of that magnitude \u2014 to bring a legal system that is truly a justice system .\nWe 're all hurting for it . I do n't care what your background is . You 're hurting for it . You 're hurting because the truth of our country \u2014 liberty and justice for all \u2014 is not being told . You 're hurting for it because you 're spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars from your annual taxpayer expenses to support an unjust system . We 're hurting for it because there 's a better way to go ; and not doing anything is making streets less safe , and destroying and undermining our children that we desperately need in a competitive economic environment to be contributing and not costing .\nSo I do n't know what it 's going to take , but I know one thing it 's going to take is us and more people getting involved and seeing this as a cause for our country , not a cause for some people over there . This really does touch us all , and there 's got to be a lot more pushing . You know the old saying \u2014 I 've heard it a million times down here : `` Change does n't come from Washington ; it comes to Washington . ''",
