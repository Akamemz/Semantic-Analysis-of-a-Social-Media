The freshman Arizona Republican revealed before the Senate Armed Services Committee she had been raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force .\nIn her first interview since coming forward with the revelation , McSally told `` CBS This Morning '' co-host Norah O'Donnell she spoke out to `` give the perspective of why I am advocating so strongly for women in the military . '' A portion of the interview will air Thursday on `` CBS This Morning , '' with more of McSally 's comments airing Friday .\n`` If anybody last night or 50 years ago has also been through a sexual assault , I just want to give them some hope . I want to shine a flashlight for them , that today can be a new day . That they can find some healing in their own lives , '' McSally said . `` They can find their own purpose and not be held back and not be stopped from fulfilling all of their potential in life because of the awful things that they were victimized from .
