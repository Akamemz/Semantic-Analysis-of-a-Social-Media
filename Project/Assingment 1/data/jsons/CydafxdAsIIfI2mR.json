    "content": "On Thursday , we examined the bind Democrats will face if House Republicans only agree to an immigration reform plan that forecloses ( or effectively forecloses ) on the possibility of eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants . What will Democrats do if the best outcome they can offer the 11 million is legal status -- freedom from the fear of deportation -- but permanently unequal status in the United States ?\nAs happy as Republicans are to jam Democrats whenever they can , though , they find themselves on the horns of a more serious dilemma . Actually , they 're on the horns of two different dilemmas simultaneously . In fact , a decent alternative title to the recently released House GOP immigration reform principles would be `` We Face Some Tremendous Immigration Reform Dilemmas . ''\nAs expected , the Republican plan contains no eventual citizenship guarantee , which means they 're unprepared at this time to support a plan that explicitly contemplates allowing the 11 million to become voting citizens . Democrats are happy with the principles insofar as they nudge the process ever so slowly along , but a reform bill that precluded citizenship or erected severe roadblocks to citizenship would create obvious tension between Democrats and advocacy groups fighting for a citizenship guarantee . It might even create tension between actual immigrants ( many of whom would be thrilled to eliminate the threat of deportation ) and the groups organizing on their behalf , who oppose a half loaf like permanent legal status for a mix of principled and parochial reasons .\n`` Half-measures that would create a permanent class of non-citizens without access to green cards should be condemned , not applauded , '' AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in response to the Republican principles . `` Until we create a functioning immigration system with a pathway to citizenship , ruthless employers will continue to exploit low wage workers , pulling down wages for all . All workers , immigrant or not , will see workplaces become safer and wages grow higher when we create a real road map to citizenship . And yet Republicans not only reject citizenship but embrace a broken guest worker model that will bring down wages and increase income inequality . ''\nBut compare it to the complications the immigration reform process creates for Republican leaders . It 's news to no one that comprehensive immigration reform severely divides conservatives .

The problem is , the GOP ca n't engage in coalition management without exposing the underbelly that disgusted minority voters in the first place .\nAnd yet here 's the principle governing the GOP 's approach to `` individuals living outside the rule of law '' :\nThere will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation \u2019 s immigration laws \u2013 that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law . Rather , these persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S. , but only if they were willing to admit their culpability , pass rigorous background checks , pay significant fines and back taxes , develop proficiency in English and American civics , and be able to support themselves and their families ( without access to public benefits ) . Criminal aliens , gang members , and sex offenders and those who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for this program .
