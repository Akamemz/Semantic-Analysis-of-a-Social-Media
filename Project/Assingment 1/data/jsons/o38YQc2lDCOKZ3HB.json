''\n`` You got the top 2 percent paying almost half of all income taxes . Is that fair ? '' Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Ariz .\nKyl was referring to official figures showing how much various income levels earn of the nation 's total income compared to how much they pay of the nation 's total income taxes .\nIRS figures show the top 1 percent of earners take home 16.9 percent of the nation 's total income , but pay 36.7 percent of the nation 's income taxes .\nThe top 5 percent take home a little more than 31 percent of total income but pay almost 59 percent of all income taxes .\nAnd the top 10 percent earn just over 43 percent of the total income but pay more than 70 percent of all income taxes .\n`` How are you going to make it fairer ?

Kyl says . `` The argument that top-tier earners are not doing enough just does not hold water . ''\nHowever , advocates of higher rates for the wealthiest Americas typically argue that it is much easier for those top earners to pay more in taxes , as compared to lower-income Americans who have much less discretionary income .\nThe president does not mention another factor in the fairness equation -- close to half of American workers pay no federal income taxes at all .\n`` That 's extremely progressive , '' says Arthur Brooks . `` That 's more progressive than our European friends , as a matter of fact .
