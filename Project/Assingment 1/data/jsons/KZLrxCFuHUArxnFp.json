Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , who is pushing the legislation in an uphill battle to fend off a GOP challenger in a runoff election next month .\nLandrieu is very close to securing the support necessary to advance the legislation .

But she needs one more Democrat to join her to reach the critical 60 vote threshold .\nBy Monday night , she said she had the votes necessary\nIt 's not clear whether she actually won someone over or was just expressing confidence ahead of a vote that could determine her political future .\nIn a three hour-long Senate floor debate Tuesday in advance of the vote , Landrieu was a bit more tentative .\n`` This is one of the first debates in eight years where the outcome is uncertain , '' she said . `` We usually know the outcome of the vote before we take it because the deals are all cut . ''\nIn her speech , Landrieu made an aggressive case in favor of approving the pipeline while other Democrats dissented .\n`` To everyone who thinks this pipeline is the end of the world -- we already have 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States , '' Landrieu said . `` We 're only completing basically 1,000 miles .
