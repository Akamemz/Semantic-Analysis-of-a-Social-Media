    "content": "Guy and Katie have noted the rather alarming collapse Hillary Clinton has seen with one of the main cohorts of her 2016 coalition : women . The former first lady has dropped an astonishing 29 points with Democratic women since July , falling from 71 percent to 42 percent . One of the main reasons why this group is running away from the candidate who could possibly make history by becoming the first female president of the United States is the email server . Women ( shocker ! ) don \u2019 t believe Clinton is telling the truth\u2013and that she did \u201c something wrong \u201d when she decided to set up this elaborate system , which by the way , was vulnerable to hacking . Clinton \u2019 s miserable messaging strategy in handling this issue has only exacerbated the former problem , which explains the dive Clinton has undergone in the trustworthiness and honesty categories ( via Patricia Murphy/Daily Beast ) [ emphasis mine ] :\nPerhaps more worrisome , women don \u2019 t seem to think she \u2019 s telling the truth about her server . Among all female voters , 51 percent in a Fox News poll said Clinton \u201c knowingly lied \u201d about her private server , while 51 percent of women in CNN \u2019 s August survey said Clinton did something wrong when she decided to control her email through her own server . Clinton \u2019 s slide among her core constituency hasn \u2019 t gone unnoticed by her Republican rivals . \u201c It appears that Democratic women are starting to trend the way of the larger electorate , \u201d said Kellyanne Conway , a longtime Republican pollster who is working for the Ted Cruz campaign this cycle . \u201c They don \u2019 t trust her , and they don \u2019 t see her projecting confidence in herself , in them , or in the future of the country. \u201d Conway said that from Republicans \u2019 perspective , Clinton would need to outperform Barack Obama \u2019 s 56 percent showing among women voters in 2008 in order to win a general election contest in 2016 . `` Knowing that women will comprise a majority of the electorate and knowing that she will under-perform among men compared to President Obama and President Clinton , she needs to get closer to 58 percent to 60 percent among women and right now she is nowhere near that . \u201d\nAgain , there \u2019 s still time to recover . Even with these abysmal numbers for Clinton , including her trailing opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) by ten points in Iowa and 22 points in New Hampshire , she 's still favored to win this primary . At the same time , she is on a path to defeat in Iowa , where her support has dropped by a third since June .
