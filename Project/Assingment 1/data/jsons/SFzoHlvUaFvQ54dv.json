I think [ the \u2018 American Dirt \u2019 incident ] is more of a hiccup along the way than an indication that we \u2019 re sliding back. \u201d ( Read the Monitor \u2019 s review of \u201c American Dirt . \u201d )\nBut bestselling author David Bowles ( \u201c Feathered Serpent , Dark Heart of Sky : Myths of Mexico \u201d ) believes that earlier protest campaigns have resulted in more empathetic rewrites that were mindful of people \u2019 s dignity .\n\u201c Why it \u2019 s happening now is because it is related to the politics of identity and the feeling that certain groups in society haven \u2019 t had a sufficient voice and representation , \u201d says Ian Buruma , former editor of The New York Review of Books . \u201c If every writer could only write about characters like themselves that would become a very narrow exercise . And the whole point of writing , especially of fiction , is that you can get into the heads of people who are not like yourself . \u201d\nAt the heart of the matter is a deeper question : How can fiction best engender empathy ?\nThe furor over \u201c American Dirt \u201d centers around a previously noncontroversial idea : authors using fiction to imagine lives other than their own . To some , the controversy represents identity politics run amok . To others , the dispute highlights a lack of diversity within the most prestigious echelons of the publishing industry .\nIt was supposed to be the book launch of every author \u2019 s dream : Jeanine Cummins had scored a rare publishing industry trifecta . She sold \u201c American Dirt \u201d for seven figures . A Hollywood studio bought the film rights . Oprah Winfrey anointed it her Book Club pick .\nYesterday , Ms. Cummins \u2019 publisher canceled her tour and issued a public apology amid a firestorm of accusations of cultural appropriation and stereotyping .\nIt \u2019 s a pattern familiar to writers of young adult , science fiction , and other genre fiction . But \u201c American Dirt , \u201d industry observers say , is the most high-profile work of literary fiction bound up in a thorny question : Who gets to tell someone \u2019 s story ?\nMs. Cummins herself acknowledged the debate in her afterword of her thriller about a Mexican mother and son escaping a drug lord by fleeing to the U.S. border . \u201c As a non-immigrant and non-Mexican , I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico , set entirely among immigrants , \u201d she wrote . \u201c I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it . \u201d\nThe furor over \u201c American Dirt \u201d centers around a previously noncontroversial idea : authors using fiction to imagine lives other than their own . To some , the controversy represents identity politics run amok . To others , the dispute highlights a lack of diversity within the most prestigious echelons of the publishing industry . At the heart of the matter is a deeper question : How can fiction best engender empathy ?\n\u201c Why it \u2019 s happening now is because it is related to the politics of identity and the feeling that certain groups in society haven \u2019 t had a sufficient voice and representation , \u201d says Ian Buruma , former editor of The New York Review of Books . \u201c But when it starts relating to fiction or drama or film , it seems to me a very doubtful discourse because , first of all , if every writer could only write about characters like themselves that would become a very narrow exercise . And the whole point of writing , especially of fiction , is that you can get into the heads of people who are not like yourself . \u201d\nThe caveat is that authors should strive for verisimilitude . Ms. Cummins has claimed she was \u201c careful and deliberate \u201d in her research and traveled extensively on both sides of the border . ( Flatiron Books agreed to the Monitor \u2019 s request for an email interview with Ms. Cummins , but she hasn \u2019 t responded to the submitted questions . )\nYet Latino authors such as Myriam Gurba , Daniel Pe\u00f1a , and David Bowles have rebuked Ms. Cummins for employing nonidiomatic Spanish phrases , homogenizing Mexicans \u2019 regional cultures and geography , and lazily relying on stereotypical tropes such as setting the first scene at a quincea\u00f1era . They fret that \u201c American Dirt \u201d will leave readers with the impression that Mexico is a hellhole .\n\u201c Cummins identified the gringo appetite for Mexican pain and found a way to exploit it , \u201d wrote Ms. Gurba ( author of the memoir \u201c Mean \u201d ) , whose caustic review notes that Ms. Cummins identified as white in a 2015 essay . In the run-up to the book \u2019 s publication , the author described herself as part Latino because her grandmother is from Puerto Rico . \u201c Critics have compared Cummins to Steinbeck , I think a more apt comparison is to Vanilla Ice , \u201d Ms. Gurba wrote .\nBy contrast , American writer Lionel Shriver ( \u201c We Need to Talk About Kevin \u201d ) has long defended the idea that authors should be free to try on other hats . At the 2017 Brisbane Writer \u2019 s Festival in Australia , she underscored that point by donning a sombrero at the end of a speech .\n\u201c We all observe each other , \u201d says Ms. Shriver . \u201c And part of self-examination is not always availing , is it ? So sometimes others can see things about you that you can \u2019 t . So I \u2019 m interested in the observations of people about groups to which they do not belong . \u201d\nLefteris Pitarakis/AP/File Writer Lionel Shriver , shown in 2007 in her London apartment , has long defended the idea that novelists should be free to write about lives unlike their own .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re a good fiction writer and a good observer of the world , there are no limits to what you can take on with enough empathy and research , \u201d says Ms. Shriver . \u201c You own the whole world for as long as you are here . It is your backyard . It is your experience . And there is no hands off . And that \u2019 s for everyone , as well as artists . So you have a right to have an opinion about it , to experience it , to think about it , to talk about it . \u201d\nOf late , several genre fiction authors have been called out for misrepresenting marginalized groups that they aren \u2019 t a part of . The civil war in the Romance Writers of America \u2013 which resulted in the resignations of multiple presidents , an entire board , and the cancellation of the 2020 convention \u2013 erupted in December after the RWA banned a Chinese American writer , Courtney Milan , for forcefully objecting on Twitter to how Kathryn Lynn Davis described Chinese characters in \u201c Somewhere Lies the Moon \u201d ( which was published in 1999 ) .\nIn the world of young adult fantasy , Am\u00e9lie Wen Zhao \u2019 s \u201c Blood Heir , \u201d Keira Drake \u2019 s \u201c The Continent , \u201d Laura Moriarty \u2019 s \u201c American Heart , \u201d and Laurie Frost \u2019 s \u201c The Black Witch \u201d were pilloried for alleged racist depictions of characters . Polite critiques on Twitter and Goodreads were about as rare as a starred review for a James Patterson thriller in Publishers Weekly . Consequently , several of those books were pulled prior to publication and revised .\nBestselling YA author Mr. Bowles ( \u201c Feathered Serpent , Dark Heart of Sky : Myths of Mexico \u201d ) believes those protest campaigns resulted in more empathetic rewrites that were more mindful of the dignity of groups of people .\n\u201c Very few people are saying that people can not write other people \u2019 s stories , but what they are saying is it is the height of privilege to believe that you are writing in a vacuum , \u201d says Mr. Bowles , who notes that relatively few books are subject to headline-making instances of blowback . \u201c All of this hand-wringing about , \u2018 You \u2019 re trying to censor me , \u2019 feels like more of a move by white hegemony \u2013 often an unconscious move , but a move nonetheless \u2013 to continue to marginalize the voices of color . \u201d\nFor its part , the publishing industry is very self-aware of its demographic makeup . Yesterday , Lee and Low Books released a survey that revealed that 76 % of employees in the industry are white , 74 % are women , 81 % are straight , and 89 % are non-disabled . In recent years , many publishing houses have striven to promote marginalized authors writing about marginalized characters with # ownvoices marketing campaigns .\nThe industry regularly employs sensitivity readers to vet books \u2013 particularly for children and young adults \u2013 for offensive material related to portrayals of race , nationality , gender , religion , sexuality , and ability . In her acknowledgments at the end of \u201c American Dirt , \u201d Ms. Cummins thanks more than a dozen Latinos who read the manuscript , including scholars and people at various nonprofit institutions in Mexico .\nSome are dubious that sensitivity readers can claim to fully represent a particular group . After all , people within different nationalities , races , classes , and genders aren \u2019 t homogenous .\n\u201c They \u2019 re being explicitly asked to make normative judgments , ethical judgments , aesthetic judgments , \u201d says philosopher and science fiction author Craig Delancey ( \u201c Gods of Earth \u201d ) . \u201c Is the fact that this particular character is a criminal somehow now expressive of certain bigotries ? \u201d\nTheir evaluations go beyond fact-checking \u2013 they \u2019 re subjective , says Mr. Delancey . Case in point : Clarkesworld magazine recently pulled the sci-fi short story \u201c I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter \u201d \u2013 not exactly a common category of intersectionality \u2013 when some readers interpreted it as a transphobic allegory . The story had been vetted by sensitivity readers . And it was written by a trans woman .\nMr. Buruma , for one , believes that authors shouldn \u2019 t strive for sensitivity in an ideological sense of placating readers . After all , many works of literature , including \u201c Lady Chatterley \u2019 s Lover , \u201d \u201c Ulysses , \u201d and \u201c Last Exit to Brooklyn \u201d have offended readers . Rather , authors should be sensitive to the behavior of their characters , who may well misbehave , as a way to understand the human heart .\n\u201c Fiction has an important role in making us understand not only ourselves better and how human behavior in general works \u2013 including our own \u2013 but where empathy comes in is that it allows us to get under the skin of people who are not like us , \u201d says Mr. Buruma , now a professor of human rights and journalism at Bard College in New York .\nBy her own account , that \u2019 s exactly what Ms. Cummins set out to accomplish with \u201c American Dirt. \u201d She wrote that she wanted to remind readers that \u201c the people coming to our border are not one faceless brown mass but singular individuals . \u201d\nSome writers , including Ann Patchett and Lauren Groff , testify to being deeply moved by the story . \u201c When I think of the migrants at the border , suffering and desperate , I think of Lydia and Luca , \u201d Ms. Groff wrote in a New York Times review , in which she also expressed anxiety over the fact that \u201c American Dirt \u201d wasn \u2019 t written by a Mexican or a migrant .\nSandra Cisneros ( \u201c The House on Mango Street \u201d ) remains a staunch defender of the book and believes it could reach audiences who wouldn \u2019 t pick up one of her books . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be [ an audience ] who maybe is undecided about issues at the border , \u201d Ms. Cisneros told NPR \u2019 s Maria Hinojosa . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be someone who wants to be entertained , and the story is going to enter like a Trojan horse and change minds . And it \u2019 s going to change the minds that , perhaps , I can \u2019 t change . \u201d\nBut for Daniel Pe\u00f1a ( \u201c Bang \u201d ) the plot amounts to \u201c lab-created brown trauma built for the white gaze and white book clubs to give a textural experience to people who need to feel something to avoid doing anything and from the safety of their chair . \u201d\nYesterday , Flatiron publisher Bob Miller issued a public apology in which he wrote , \u201c We should never have claimed that it was a novel that defined the migrant experience. \u201d The publisher also canceled Ms. Cummins \u2019 extensive book tour due to \u201c specific threats to booksellers and the author. \u201d Ms. Winfrey now says she wants to host a \u201c deeper conversation \u201d about \u201c American Dirt \u201d on her Apple+ TV show .\nFlatiron promises a series of town hall meetings at a later point in which Ms. Cummins \u201c will be joined by some of the groups who have raised objections to the book. \u201d Mr. Miller added , \u201c We believe that this provides an opportunity to come together and unearth difficult truths to help us move forward as a community . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
