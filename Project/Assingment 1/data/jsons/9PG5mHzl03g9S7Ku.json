Where Democrats allege that Mr. Trump improperly used his office to try to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival , Mr. Jordan argues the president \u2019 s opponents are trying to connect unrelated events , based largely on hearsay , to undo the 2016 election .\nNow , Rep. Jim Jordan has emerged as the GOP \u2019 s point man in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump .\nHe cut his teeth in Congress grilling witnesses on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform . A college wrestling champion , he helped drive former Republican Speaker John Boehner into early retirement .\nHe made his name in Congress as an uncompromising brawler . A college wrestling champion , he cut his teeth on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform , grilling witnesses in high-profile hearings . He later co-founded the hard-line House Freedom Caucus that helped drive former Republican Speaker John Boehner into early retirement .\nNow Rep. Jim Jordan has emerged as the GOP \u2019 s point man in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump .\nUnlike his colleagues , the Ohio congressman regularly shows up to the hearings sans jacket , in just shirtsleeves and tie . He interrupts , corrects , and claps back . On Friday , during the testimony of former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch , Rep. Adam Schiff , the House Intelligence Committee \u2019 s Democratic chair , tried to cut Mr. Jordan off after the latter had reached his five-minute limit for questioning . \u201c My indulgence is wearing out , \u201d Mr. Schiff said .\n\u201c Our indulgence wore out with you a long time ago , Mr. Chairman , \u201d Mr. Jordan retorted .\nObservers say the Ohio congressman is particularly skilled at building \u2013 in clear , easy-to-understand sound bites \u2013 an impeachment counternarrative . Where Democrats allege that Mr. Trump improperly used his office to try to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival , Mr. Jordan and other Republicans argue that the president \u2019 s opponents are trying to connect unrelated events , based largely on hearsay , to undo the result of the 2016 election .\n\u201c The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people , \u201d Mr. Jordan declared Tuesday . \u201c They \u2019 ve been out to get the president since the day he was elected . \u201d\n\u201c [ Mr. Jordan ] is someone who has built a reputation as an attack dog , someone who is media savvy , someone who is a stalwart supporter of the president and who has the skill necessary to take the lead for the GOP , \u201d says Capri Cafaro , a former Democratic Ohio state representative and now an executive in residence at American University .\nMr. Jordan \u2019 s return to the limelight after a failed attempt last year to challenge Rep. Kevin McCarthy for minority leader also reflects the extent to which spectacle is central to the impeachment process .\nIn today \u2019 s polarized political landscape , the outcome seems almost preordained : that the Democratic-controlled House will vote to impeach the president , and the Republican-led Senate will vote to acquit him . Public opinion polls on impeachment have hardly budged in the weeks since the probe began , and an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this week found that nearly two-thirds of respondents could not envision any new information changing their minds on the matter .\nWhich means the televised hearings are in many ways about theatrics \u2013 with each side appealing to its own voters \u2019 emotions and trying to make a case that will help turn them out for next year \u2019 s elections .\n\u201c Political implications are all that \u2019 s left at this point , \u201d Ms. Cafaro says .\nFriday \u2019 s exchange between Mr. Jordan and Mr. Schiff was one of a number of clashes between the two men since impeachment hearings went public . Mr. Jordan objects frequently , whether it \u2019 s to urge the chair to publish yet-unreleased transcripts from the committee \u2019 s closed-door depositions , or to accuse him of withholding the name of the whistleblower who first brought attention to Mr. Trump \u2019 s now-famous July 25 call with the president of Ukraine . ( Mr. Schiff denies that he knows who the person is , and has vowed to protect the person \u2019 s identity . )\nWitnesses aren \u2019 t spared , either . On Tuesday , Mr. Jordan tried to undermine the credibility of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman , reading from a deposition transcript that appeared to raise questions about the National Security Council official \u2019 s judgment , and suggesting a possible connection to the whistleblower . \u201c Your colleagues felt that there were times that you leaked information , \u201d Mr. Jordan said . \u201c Any idea why they have those impressions ? \u201d Colonel Vindman , a Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq , called the suggestion \u201c preposterous . \u201d\nLast week , Mr. Jordan went after William Taylor , the top United States diplomat in Ukraine , insisting that Mr. Taylor \u2019 s information was suspect . \u201c And you \u2019 re their star witness , \u201d Mr. Jordan said . \u201c I \u2019 ve seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this . \u201d\nGOP Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina applauded his colleague the next day . \u201c He \u2019 s probably one of the best at not only preparation , but delivery , \u201d he says . \u201c He certainly did an outstanding job . \u201d\nA four-time high school state wrestling champion , Mr. Jordan went on to win two NCAA Division I titles for the University of Wisconsin-Madison before becoming an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University .
