Overall , Obama beat Romney by just over 2 million votes .\nTo win the Republican primary , Romney had to adopt conservative stances on sensitive social issues -- such as opposing gay marriage , abortion and a pathway to legal status for many young undocumented immigrants -- which alienated increasingly significant demographics of the American electorate , analysts noted .\nThe former governor of moderate Massachusetts tried to move back to the political center in the final month of the campaign , but questions persisted about Republican stances on social issues .\n`` Latinos were disillusioned with Barack Obama , but they are absolutely terrified by the idea of Mitt Romney , '' GOP fundraiser Ana Navarro told CNN .\nGOP strategist Lenny McAllister said Thursday that the problem involved both substance and style .\n`` I think that when it comes to our principles , when it comes to the economy , when it comes to education and some of the things that we want to offer the American people , the Republican Party and our conservative principles have something to offer Latinos and African-Americans , '' McAllister told CNN .\n`` But when you 're talking about electrified fences and you 're talking about voter suppression , you 're not going to win any voters within those two groups , '' he continued . `` And that 's the reason why we need leaders within the conservative movement and the Republican Party that can articulate the values without going down that very dangerous and insulting path that we saw throughout 2012 . ''\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , the de facto leader of the party in the election 's aftermath , acknowledged Friday that a necessary internal discussion had started .\n`` It 's clear that as a political party we 've got some work to do , '' Boehner told reporters , adding that `` the principles of our party are sound '' but the question is `` how we talk about who we are as a party . ''\nFor now , `` conversations are under way and will continue , '' Boehner said .\nThat message seemed lost on many conservatives , at least in their initial reactions .\nSome blamed the Romney loss on Superstorm Sandy , which slammed the East Coast from Maryland to Connecticut to disrupt campaigning the week before the election . Former Mississippi Gov . Haley Barbour told CNN the storm and its aftermath halted Romney 's momentum .\nAt a news conference Wednesday , a coalition of social conservatives and tea party activists said Romney 's campaign failed to represent them on a national level .\n`` Conservatives were left out in the cold , '' complained Brent Bozell , president of the conservative Media Research Center . `` It should have been a landslide for Romney , had he embraced a truly conservative agenda . ''\nIn a campaign defined by bitter attacks on both sides , Bozell faulted Romney for not being even more aggressive , saying , `` It should have been a cakewalk for Romney to define ( the president ) , but he did n't -- hence Obama 's victory . ''\nMeanwhile , Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List criticized Romney for failing to make abortion a central campaign issue . Stronger attacks on the administration 's policies , such as a requirement that religious organizations provide their employees with health care coverage that she said included abortion-inducing drugs , would have attracted more support from uncommitted voters , Dannenfelser argued .\n`` He took all the right stances , '' she said . `` The problem was not communicating on the national stage with Obama what ( the president 's ) actual positions were . ''\nHer group endorsed Romney , Dannenfelser said , adding , `` We assumed that given who he was , he would make ( abortion ) more of a national issue . ''\nAccording to exit polls , 59 % of voters think abortion should be legal in the United States , compared with 36 % who said it should be illegal .\nJenny Beth Martin , co-founder of Tea Party Patriots , pinned the election loss on `` a weak , moderate candidate , hand-picked by the Beltway elites and country club establishment wing of the Republican Party . ''\nHer claim elicited a vulgarity from retiring Rep. Steve LaTourette , a moderate Republican who told CNN on Thursday : `` There 's a one-word phrase we use in Ohio for that : crap . ''\nLaTourette says the hyper-partisan environment in Washington politics prompted him not to run for a 10th term this year . He attributed his party 's election failure on far-right viewpoints on social issues , saying the GOP needs to `` get out of peoples ' lives , get out of their bedrooms . ''\n`` We sent ( women ) running back to the Democratic Party because they think we 're nutty , '' LaTourette said of comments about rape by Mourdock of Indiana and Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri , conservatives who both lost Senate races Tuesday in states won by Romney .\nMourdock came under criticism for saying it was God 's will when a child is conceived by rape , while Akin was forced to apologize and declare as wrong his statement that `` legitimate '' rape rarely causes pregnancy .\nAnother retiring Republican , Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , also cited the comments by Mourdock and Akin as detrimental .\n`` We had Republican candidates who got very high profile and said some very stupid things . I think that really tainted the party , '' Hutchison told CNN on Thursday , adding : `` People have personal beliefs , and what we need to do is fashion a party around the economics and the long-term viability of the economy of our country . When people start trying to go into such personal issues and then try to form a party around it , it 's very difficult . ''\nTo McAllister , the GOP strategist , it comes down to Republicans needing to get better at communicating their core principles .\n`` They have n't been able to articulate the conservative Republican message without being insulting , '' he said . `` I think that , moving forward , you 'll see some leaders be able to do that extremely well . And you 'll continue to see others that slip when it comes to this . ''\nOther Republicans said the party needs to broaden its base by becoming more inclusive to minorities .\n`` The question is do they want to , in a disciplined way , create a schedule and a program and include people who are not traditionally Republican , '' said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who lost to Romney in the GOP primary race this year .\nHutchison called Texas a possible model for the party , noting it permits some children of illegal immigrants to attend state universities and that her successor in the Senate will be Ted Cruz , whose family came from Cuba .\n`` I think Texas is a way forward to show you can be very conservative and talk about the issues that Hispanics ... embrace , '' she said .\nWhile losing the presidential race and failing to win a Senate majority , Republicans held on to their control of the U.S. House , setting up a repeat of the political breakdown in Washington of the past two years .\nSome Republicans say the gridlock of the 112th Congress , which concludes at the end of the year , may give way to a new sense of cooperation in the session that starts in January , motivated by a political survival instinct if nothing else .\n`` I think , finally , everybody will start working together , because over the last three terms , we 've seen everybody be humiliated and be humbled a little bit , '' McAllister said . `` In 2008 , it was the Republicans . In 2010 , it was the Democrats . In 2012 , it 's been the tea party element . So , everybody has finally been humbled to a point where they have to come to the table and start working for Americans , not just for their own political interest . ''\nSawhill , the Brookings fellow , said she expected moderate elements of traditional Republican support -- such as the business community -- to pressure party leaders to work with Democrats on solutions to vexing problems such as a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits and debts . Citing the `` public disenchantment with the way Washington is working , she told a post-election forum Wednesday that Republicans `` have to work a little harder to make sure there is more compromise in the future . ''\nThe initials signs were mixed . Boehner expressed a desire to work out a deal with Obama and Democrats during the week and at a news conference on Friday .\nHowever , he stuck to the hard-line Republican position of no tax increases as part of a package including spending cuts and entitlement reforms .\n`` Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want , '' Boehner said Friday , noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners . But he also said that `` everything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at . ''\nEarlier this week , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the Democratic plan to let tax cuts from President George W.
