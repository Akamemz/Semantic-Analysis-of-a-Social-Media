After all , Pope Francis had made no similarly voluble criticism of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s policies . Yet in the end the pope \u2019 s influence proved hollow . The \u201c people \u2019 s pontiff \u201d looked more like the liberal elite \u2019 s pontiff as Clinton went down to defeat , with Trump even winning the Catholic vote 52-45 . According to the Italian press , many of Pope Francis \u2019 s aides viewed the election as a \u201c bitter defeat . \u201d\nThey still do , and Pope Francis has encouraged them to undercut Trump \u2019 s agenda . It is no coincidence that shortly before the November 2016 election , Pope Francis gave a red hat to a critic of Mike Pence \u2014 Archbishop Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis . At the time of Tobin \u2019 s elevation he was representing an archdiocese with less than 250,000 parishioners , an archdiocese that has never had a cardinal ( He has since been moved to Newark , New Jersey . ) The Associated Press called it a \u201c surprise pick \u201d and said that it sent a \u201c political message \u201d to his colleagues , given Tobin \u2019 s reputation for political liberalism : \u201c Tobin has openly opposed efforts by Indiana Governor Mike Pence , now Donald Trump \u2019 s running mate , to bar Syrian refugees from being resettled in the state . \u201d\nAfter Trump and Pence entered office , Tobin , with Pope Francis \u2019 s blessing , instructed his fellow bishops to ramp up their resistance , \u201c given the possibility that the administration isn \u2019 t going to be very interested in the questions that Pope Francis is interested in . \u201d\nEver since , Tobin has been hectoring the bishops to oppose Trump \u2019 s environmental , economic , and immigration policies . From Tobin on the East Coast to Cardinal Cupich ( in Chicago ) to Bishop McElroy ( in San Diego ) , the bishops are operating like anti-Trump lobbyists .

San Jose \u2019 s bishop , Patrick McGrath , wrote a letter to his flock in which he said that Donald Trump \u2019 s complaint of a rigged system \u201c borders on the seditious. \u201d Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester said that \u201c I think some of the rhetoric coming out of [ the Trump ] campaign is deplorable. \u201d He dismissed Trump \u2019 s position as \u201c scapegoating and targeting people like the immigrant , the refugee and the poor . \u201d\nBut in a measure of Pope Francis \u2019 s wilting support among conservatives , the pope \u2019 s criticism of Trump only enhanced Trump \u2019 s appeal in the Republican primaries .
