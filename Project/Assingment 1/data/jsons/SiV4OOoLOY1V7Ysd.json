    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : Preparations have begun for the first presidential debate . It \u2019 ll be held September 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead , New York . While polls show Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are among the least popular major-party candidates to ever run for the White House , it appears no third-party candidates will be invited to take part in the debates . Debates are organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates , which is controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties . Under the commission \u2019 s rules , candidates will only be invited if they \u2019 re polling at 15 percent in five national surveys . Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson and the Greens \u2019 Dr. Jill Stein have both witnessed recent surges in support , but neither have crossed the 15 percent threshold . Johnson has polled as high as 12 percent nationwide , while Stein has peaked at 6 percent in recent national polls . But in some demographics , they \u2019 re both beating Donald Trump . McClatchy recently polled voters under the age of 30 and found 41 percent back Hillary Clinton , 23 percent support Johnson , 16 percent back Jill Stein , while only 9 percent back Donald Trump . Among African Americans , polls also show Trump behind all three other candidates , polling at either zero , 1 or 2 percent . More than 12,000 people have signed a petition organized by RootsAction calling for a four-way presidential debate .\nIn a moment , we \u2019 ll be joined by the Green Party \u2019 s Jill Stein and her running mate , Ajamu Baraka , but first I want to turn to George Farah , the founder and executive director of Open Debates . He spoke on \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! a few years ago about how the Democrats and Republicans took control of the debate process .\nGEORGE FARAH : The League of Women Voters ran the presidential debate process from 1976 until 1984 , and they were a very courageous and genuinely independent , nonpartisan sponsor . And whenever the candidates attempted to manipulate the presidential debates behind closed doors , either to exclude a viable independent candidate or to sanitize the formats , the League had the courage to challenge the Republican and Democratic nominees and , if necessary , go public .\nIn 1980 , independent candidate John B. Anderson was polling about 12 percent in the polls . The League insisted that Anderson be allowed to participate , because the vast majority of the American people wanted to see him , but Jimmy Carter , President Jimmy Carter , refused to debate him . The League went forward anyway and held a presidential debate with an empty chair , showing that Jimmy Carter wasn \u2019 t going to show up .\nFour years later , when the Republican and Democratic nominees tried to get rid of difficult questions by vetoing 80 of the moderators that they had proposed to host the debates , the League said , \u201c This is unacceptable. \u201d They held a press conference and attacked the campaigns for trying to get rid of difficult questions .\nAnd lastly , in 1988 , was the first attempt by the Republican and Democratic campaigns to negotiate a detailed contract . It was tame by comparison , a mere 12 pages . It talked about who could be in the audience and how the format would be structured , but the League found that kind of lack of transparency and that kind of candidate control to be fundamentally outrageous and antithetical to our democratic process . They released the contract and stated they refuse to be an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American people and refuse to implement it .\nAnd today , what do we have ? We have a private corporation that was created by the Republican and Democratic parties called the Commission on Presidential Debates . It seized control of the presidential debates precisely because the League was independent , precisely because this women \u2019 s organization had the guts to stand up to the candidates that the major-party candidates had nominated .\nAMY GOODMAN : That was George Farah , founder and executive director of Open Debates , speaking on \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! in 2012 . He \u2019 s the author of No Debate : How the Republican and Democratic Parties Secretly Control the Presidential Debates .\nWell , joining us now is Green Party presidential nominee Dr. Jill Stein , along with her running mate , Ajamu Baraka , a longtime human rights activist . Baraka is the founding executive director of the U.S. Human Rights Network and coordinator of the U.S.-based Black Left Unity Network \u2019 s Committee on International Affairs .\nWe welcome you both to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! So , September 26 , that \u2019 s the first presidential debate . What are your plans , Dr. Jill Stein ?\nDR. JILL STEIN : Our plans are to be in that debate , because it \u2019 s not just about whether our party will be included , it \u2019 s whether the American people will have a voice , whether we will have a real discussion of the crisis of jobs , of the climate , of race , of war . These\u2014and the crisis of a generation , an entire generation that \u2019 s basically been hung out to dry , that can not get out of predatory student loan debt , that doesn \u2019 t have the jobs they need , and doesn \u2019 t have a climate future to look forward to . So , these are really the critical issues that people want to discuss .\nWe saw an incredible surge of a response last night , when we had our first prime-time TV . And I want to note that while we \u2019 ve come up to 6 and even 7 percent in the polls , this has happened without any media coverage , really , whatsoever on\u2014you know , in the mainstream media . So , it \u2019 s absolutely remarkable that we \u2019 ve not only doubled and tripled , even more than that , because we were invisible as of about two months ago in the polls , suddenly we \u2019 re up there . So there \u2019 s an enormous interest in what we \u2019 re talking about .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , let \u2019 s go back to 2012 . The debate then was at Hofstra , as it will be on September 26 . You and your running mate then , Cheri Honkala , were arrested as you attempted to enter the site of the presidential debate at Hofstra . \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! was there at the time of your arrest .\nDR. JILL STEIN : Well , we \u2019 re here to stand our ground . We \u2019 re here to stand ground for the American people , who have been systematically locked out of these debates for decades by the Commission on Presidential Debates . We think that this commission is entirely illegitimate ; that if\u2014if democracy truly prevailed , there would be no such commission , that the debates would still be run by the League of Women Voters , that the debates would be open with the criteria that the League of Women Voters had always used , which was that if you have done the work to get on the ballot , if you are on the ballot and could actually win the Electoral College by being on the ballot in enough states , that you deserve to be in the election and you deserve to be heard ; and that the American people actually deserve to hear choices which are not bought and paid for by multinational corporations and Wall Street .\nPOLICE OFFICER 1 : Ladies and gentlemen , you are obstructing the vehicle of pedestrians and traffic . If you refuse to move , you are subject to arrest .\nPOLICE OFFICER 3 : Would you step up , please ? Stand up , please ?\nPOLICE OFFICER 2 : We \u2019 ll help you . Come on . Thank you , ma \u2019 am .\nPOLICE OFFICER 3 : Thank you . You guys have to stay here . All right , everybody , we \u2019 re going to ask you to please move back .\nDR. JILL STEIN : Well , I \u2019 d say this is what democracy looks like in the 21st century . I \u2019 m afraid it \u2019 s going to take some\u2014some politics and courage here to get our democracy back . So , more to come .\nAMY GOODMAN : \u201c More to come , \u201d you said . So , you \u2019 re taken away , Dr. Jill Stein , from the Hofstra campus . Where did you and Cheri Honkala\u2014where were you taken ?\nDR. JILL STEIN : We were taken to a dark site , where nobody knew where we were , an unmarked facility that was basically being run by , I think , Homeland Security and the Secret Service and local police . We were surrounded by , according to Cheri , who counted them , some 16 police and colleagues , and handcuffed tightly to these metal chairs for about seven hours .\nDR. JILL STEIN : Seven hours , until the debates were long over and everyone had gone home . It was , I think , an incredible testimony to how fearful the political establishment was , and is , that people should learn that they actually have another choice in that race\u2014and all the more so in this race , because we know that the current candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties are the most unpopular , the most disliked and untrusted presidential candidates in history . So , people are clamoring for another choice . And we\u2014you know , we \u2019 re building a campaign to get into the debates , and we \u2019 ll keep people posted as to what our actions will be , coming up . But we will not leave this just to the establishment to shut down political opposition , which is what this commission is doing .\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you plan to head to Hofstra on September 26th ?\nDR. JILL STEIN : Absolutely . Whether we are in the debate or whether we are locked out of the debate , you can be sure that we \u2019 re going to be there . And we \u2019 re not going to be there alone . We \u2019 re going to be there with the American people , who are demanding that we open up the debate and make it a real service to our democracy .\nDR. JILL STEIN : We have two cases , one of which has been dismissed . The other one is still technically in effect . We are not holding our breath that this is going to be favorably decided in a court of law , but there \u2019 s every reason for this to be decided in the court of public opinion , where public opinion is very clear that people have had it , not only with the rigged economy , but the rigged political system and with the dialogue , which is rigged by the Democratic and Republican parties . This commission is a private corporation run by the two political parties . The League of Women Voters called it a fraud being perpetrated on the American public . We \u2019 re not going to settle for that .\nAMY GOODMAN : Earlier this year , I spoke to Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson in his home state of New Mexico . He talked about the unfair nature of the presidential debate system , as well .\nGARY JOHNSON : Right now , running for president of the United States as a Libertarian , there is no way that a third party wins . There \u2019 s no way that I have a chance of winning , unless I \u2019 m in the presidential debates . There is the possibility of being at 15 percent in the polls , though , if I \u2019 m in the polls , that I could be in the presidential debates .\nAMY GOODMAN : You \u2019 re part of a lawsuit going after the Presidential Debate Commission ?\nGARY JOHNSON : Yes , on the basis that\u2014on the basis of the Sherman Act , that politics is a business , that Democrats and Republicans collude with one another to exclude everybody else . We think that the discovery phase of this lawsuit is going to provide national insight into just how rigged the system is . I come back to the fact that 50 percent of Americans right now declare themselves as independent . Where is that representation ?\nAMY GOODMAN : That was former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson , who is running on the Libertarian line for president . We \u2019 re talking to Dr. Jill Stein , presidential nominee of the Green Party . And when we come back from break , you \u2019 ll meet her running mate , Ajamu Baraka , new to the electoral scene , the vice-presidential nominee for the Green Party . Stay with us .",
