( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\nThe allegations against Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 are substantial and serious . She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down , groped her , and attempted to remove her clothes . Here \u2019 s the core of her story :\nWhile his friend watched , she said , Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes , grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it . When she tried to scream , she said , he put his hand over her mouth . \u201c I thought he might inadvertently kill me , \u201d said Ford , now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California . \u201c He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. \u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh \u2019 s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School , Mark Judge , jumped on top of them , sending all three tumbling . She said she ran from the room , briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house .\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault . I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties , and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things , but an act like this was beyond the pale . This isn \u2019 t \u201c boys will be boys. \u201d Actions have consequences , and it \u2019 s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this \u2014 even a long time ago \u2014 he has to remain \u201c merely \u201d a judge on the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals .\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story , however , the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot . At the very least , if the attack happened , he should be disqualified for lying .\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story , there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred . We don \u2019 t need certainty , however , to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court . I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore , for Donald Trump , for Bill Clinton \u2014 or for any other politician who \u2019 s accused of misconduct .

I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault . I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls .

So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this # MeToo moment .
