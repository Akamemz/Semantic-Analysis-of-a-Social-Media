    "content": "With about two months left in the campaign , the national race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has gotten closer , but Clinton still appears to be solidly ahead in more than enough swing states to deliver her the presidency .\nYes , the race seems to have tightened since Clinton \u2019 s peak in the early August post-convention period . At that time , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s lead over Trump in national polls rose to around 8 to 9 points on average , and now appears to be something more like 3 to 5 points . Trump has even led the occasional poll lately . And in key swing states , there have been fewer polls showing Clinton up by eye-popping double digit margins , in contrast to early August .\nBut current polling averages for both RealClearPolitics and HuffPost Pollster do still show Clinton leading Donald Trump in almost every traditional swing state . Furthermore , Clinton remains not only ahead but pretty comfortably ahead in states that would be enough to provide her with a majority of electoral college votes .\nIn the below map , I \u2019 ve projected states to Clinton or Trump if either is leading both polling averages by 5 or more points , and kept the closer states as undecided . As you can see , Clinton currently has enough solid-looking leads to top 270 electoral vote that would give her a win .\nNow , there have been more national polls recently than state polls \u2014 so it \u2019 s possible that the swing state data is a bit outdated , and doesn \u2019 t fully reflect the national tightening . And there could of course be more movement in the coming weeks , particularly once the debates get started .\nStill , it would take a pretty dramatic shift ( or polling failure ) overall to tip the election to Trump . And historical precedent is on Clinton \u2019 s side , as the candidate ahead by this point in the election cycle has almost always gone on to win in recent decades .\nClinton starts off with a bloc of 201 votes or so that have always seemed to solidly be in her column ( give or take one electoral vote from Maine \u2019 s second congressional district ) .\nFrom there , her easiest path to to victory appears to be :\nHold on to Wisconsin and Michigan in the Rust Belt . Win Colorado and Virginia , which have growing nonwhite populations but also lots of educated white voters , two groups Trump has been struggling with . Finally , win New Hampshire and Pennsylvania to get over the top .\nClinton came out of the conventions with bigger than usual bounces in all six of these states . Indeed , she \u2019 s led every single poll conducted in each of them since mid-July , and many by very large double digit margins .\nFurthermore , Clinton \u2019 s campaign has omitted four of these states \u2014 Wisconsin , Michigan , Colorado , and Virginia \u2014 from its latest round of targeted swing state ad buys . This suggests that Clinton \u2019 s team views her lead in each of these four as quite safe , for now at least .\nIf Trump doesn \u2019 t manage to pry at least one of the above states out of Clinton \u2019 s hands , his loss is assured . But he needs to do more than that \u2014 he needs to win all or nearly all of the remaining swing states too , most of which Clinton is currently favored in .\nThese include the traditional big prizes of Florida and Ohio as well as the rapidly diversifying North Carolina \u2014 since the conventions , Clinton has posted leads in the low- to mid-single digits in all three . And then Nevada and Iowa , which both appear to be quite close , round out the traditional swing state lineup .\nFinally , there \u2019 s a few traditionally red states that have ended up looking surprisingly close this year \u2014 most notably Arizona and Georgia , where Trump has very small leads in poll averages .\nIt \u2019 s also worth keeping in mind that the Clinton campaign seems to have two key advantages in battleground states that might not show up in national polling . First , Clinton has heavily outspent Trump in advertising in swing states \u2014 until late August , in fact , Trump \u2019 s campaign had spent nothing on general election ads , while Clinton has spent tens of millions .\nSecond , by all accounts , the Clinton team has set up a more organized and disciplined campaign operation in swing states . ( For instance , as of late August Clinton had 34 campaign offices in Florida but Trump had just one . ) So if Clinton \u2019 s team is better able to identify and turn out its voters during early voting and on election day , her margin in polls could be padded even further .\nOverall , the current polling points to a strong electoral vote win for Clinton , resembling Barack Obama \u2019 s margin of victory over John McCain in 2008 . But Democrats have dreamed of doing even better , hoping that Trump \u2019 s unpopularity could carry Clinton to a nationwide landslide .\nThere are a few data points that have given Democrats reason to hope this is happening : Occasional polls have shown Clinton close or ahead in deep red bastions like South Carolina and Texas . And since these states are even less frequently polled than swing states , it \u2019 s difficult to get a sense of what \u2019 s been going on there .\nStill , if current polls are accurate , a Clinton landslide doesn \u2019 t appear likely .
