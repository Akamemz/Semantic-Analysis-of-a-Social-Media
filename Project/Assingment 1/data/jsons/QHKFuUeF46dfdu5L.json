    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nRegarding Pelosi , \u201c [ her ] talents have always lain in the less glamorous , less public side of politics : she is good at whipping up votes in her caucus and she is good at disciplining dissenters . She is good at offering incentives and punishments to get Democratic members of Congress to do what she wants them to do\u2026 To rip up the speech on television was a bit of theatricality , sure \u2013 a ploy designed to get attention . It also worked . The day after Trump made a long speech full of misinformation that tried to make a case for his re-election , no one is talking about him . Instead we are talking about the speaker of the House . That , too , is a skill , one that Pelosi seems to be honing. \u201d Moira Donegan , The Guardian\nFinally , many point out that while Yang \u2019 s campaign has ended , \u201c [ his ] remaining rivals bought in to his pitch months ago . Elizabeth Warren spoke about automation at the October debate ; Joe Biden discussed the fourth industrial revolution on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . As for Yang \u2019 s $ 1,000-a-month idea ? His campaign \u2019 s pollsters put together a memo showing that support for the plan in Iowa grew from 17 percent of expected caucus-goers in September to 60 percent in January . And he managed to do it without winning a single delegate. \u201d Edward-Isaac Dovere , The Atlantic\nRegarding Michael Bennet , some note that \u201c In many ways , [ Biden and Buttigieg ] were worse avatars for Democratic centrism than Bennet , who crafted his \u2018 Real Deal \u2019 with an eye to what his colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus would rally behind\u2026 Bennet \u2019 s child allowance plan has 38 Senate Democrats backing it , far more than any other candidate \u2019 s trademark spending plan . At the same time , Bennet emphasized policies that don \u2019 t need congressional buy-in but which the rest of the field often overlooked\u2026 \u201c He , for instance , had the most aggressive monetary policy platform of any candidate , calling on the Federal Reserve to put workers and wage increases first instead of focusing on preventing inflation\u2026 Whoever the next president is , the odds are their eventual policy record may look more like Bennet \u2019 s platform than their own. \u201d Dylan Matthews , Vox\nMeanwhile , \u201c [ Klobuchar is ] not an incredible dynamo of charisma , but she does have a kind of charming dorky Midwestern shtick . She sticks to popular policy positions , and she has a strong track record of winning the kind of voters Democrats need to carry in November \u2026 Back in 2012 , President Obama won 53 percent of the vote in Minnesota . Klobuchar won 65 percent\u2026 \u201c Earlier this year , FiveThirtyEight computed a \u2018 popularity above replacement senator \u2019 score for every member of the upper house . It compares each senator \u2019 s home state favorable rating to the underlying partisan attributes of the state . Nos . 1 and 2 are West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Alabama Sen. Doug Jones , who \u2019 ve run and won in deep-red states . No . 3 is Klobuchar \u2014 a Democrat who is just really good at making Midwesterners like her\u2026 If [ Biden 's ] basic message appeals to you \u2014 and clearly it does appeal to a lot of Democrats \u2014 you owe it to yourself to ask if Klobuchar isn \u2019 t the most effective vehicle for that message. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\n\u201c Rather than risk alienating young Democrats and independent voters by seeking refuge in the comfort of a Michael Bloomberg or an Amy Klobuchar , party elites should instead stop worrying and learn to feel the Bern . All available evidence suggests that he 's a very good bet to defeat the president\u2026 center-left Democrats need to get George McGovern and Walter Mondale out of their heads . 1972 was a lifetime ago . Sanders has been a national figure for nearly five years , and wall-to-wall hysteria about socialism has done little to dim the public 's enthusiasm for him\u2026 \u201c We have a colossal amount of polling data stretching back many years which suggests Sanders would be a very strong general election candidate . Not only was he leading Trump by an average 10.4-point margin in June 2016 \u2014 8 points better at that time than Hillary Clinton \u2014 but he has continued to lead now-President Trump in virtually every survey conducted over the past three years. \u201d David Faris , The Week\n\u201c In 2000 , designated Clinton successor Al Gore put down a challenge from liberal free-thinker Bill Bradley in the primary\u2014a CNN story from March 1999 described Gore \u2019 s \u2018 orchestrated rollout of endorsements \u2019 demonstrating his clear hold on the Democratic establishment\u2014but lost , as it were , to George W. Bush . In 2004 , John Kerry succeeded in reining in outsider candidate Howard Dean\u2014who \u2019 d been denounced as an unelectable \u2018 McGovern-Mondale \u2019 extremist by the Democratic Leadership Council\u2014before Iowa but also lost to Bush\u2026 \u201c Hillary Clinton started the 2008 primary cycle with advantages in polling , endorsements , and large-donor fundraising , but lost to Barack Obama . She nearly lost an even larger lead in the 2016 primary , and then , in the general election \u2026 well , you know\u2026 [ And now ] yet another establishment Democratic frontrunner is failing to get the job done . \u201d Ben Mathis-Lilley , Slate\nThe right sees the results as a loss for Biden and Warren , making Sanders the favorite to win the nomination .\nThe right sees the results as a loss for Biden and Warren , making Sanders the favorite to win the nomination .\n\u201c Joe Biden is , if not toast , on life support . On paper , he \u2019 s only 15 delegates or so back behind Buttigieg , and only 14 behind Sanders . But getting nothing out of New Hampshire , when he had remained among the front-runners in mid-January , means the bottom has fallen out\u2026 Exit polls suggested more moderates were voting for Bernie Sanders than him . His plan is apparently to hope that he still has enough oomph to win South Carolina by a wide margin , and that that win somehow turbocharges him to a good performance on Super Tuesday three days later . That is not a high-probability path to victory\u2026\n\u201c Elizabeth Warren , by comparison , is toast \u2014 or like a character in an M. Night Shyamalan movie , she \u2019 s already gone , and is walking around not knowing yet . Her third-place , 20 percent , eight-delegate finish in Iowa was pretty \u2018 meh \u2019 considering she once led the state , and finishing in fourth place , below the 15-percent threshold for delegates , is pretty disappointing . As a Massachusetts senator , this is her backyard . She \u2019 s Biden without the theoretical firewall of South Carolina . \u201d\n\u201c Biden maintained a steady frontrunner status when he had the centrist vote pretty much all to himself . But as he showed weakness , culminating in a similarly dismal showing in Iowa last week , electability-minded Democrats began to shop around . That has benefited not only Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana , but also Klobuchar who actually improved on her Iowa showing and improbably broke into the top three . The proliferation of alternatives to Bernie , even before we get to contests where Michael Bloomberg is on the ballot , is bad news for Biden\u2026 Centrist Democrats are abandoning Biden at an alarming rate . If African-American voters are next , he is doomed . \u201d\n\u201c Many Sanders supporters are going to resent that , in the second contest in a row , he won the most votes yet his performance was seemingly discounted . Some other person ( first Buttigieg , now Amy Klobuchar ) will be declared \u2018 the winner of the night \u2019 ... In fact , the emergence of Amy Klobuchar may be a godsend to Bernie \u2019 s campaign . Klobuchar directly targeted Buttigieg in the last debate , and she prospered . She will command serious media attention and may very well prevent donors and leading Democratic officeholders from endorsing Buttigieg to stop Sanders\u2026\n\u201c Right now Bernie Sanders has the highest approval rating among Democrats of all the remaining candidates . He is the second choice of most Biden and Warren supporters\u2026 Roughly two in five Democrats are willing to support a non-Sanders candidate such as Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar , but crucially , they are not consolidating and granting either of them a full 40 percent in any one state . Which of these candidates can and will consistently beat Sanders ? And when ? \u201d\n\u201c In crucial respects , [ Sanders \u2019 s ] performance this time around has been more like Trump \u2019 s in 2016 . Trump had a strong core of support and the gift of a divided opposition . New Hampshire didn \u2019 t help the opposition coalesce behind anyone . Republicans who hoped there was time to stop him kept finding it impossible to unite , and while they scattered Trump kept building momentum\u2026 anti-Sanders Democrats , too , may find that it is later than they think . \u201d\nRegarding Yang , \u201c [ he ] was a technocrat who married utopianism and realism in a race devoid of both . But Yang differentiated himself by broadcasting as wide a net as possible , drawing supporters spanning from those formerly of President Trump to Bernie Sanders . Yang was happy to appear on right-wing shows such as Ben Shapiro 's while running for the Democratic nomination . He would tout contemporary feminism while also noting that full-time mothers such as his own wife deserved a seat at the table in our political debates too\u2026\n\u201c This is not the last we 've seen of Yang , who now is a celebrity in his own right . He has an ample fundraising base and platform to run in nearly any race in his home state of New York that he wishes to . And everyone , conservative and liberal alike , ought to hope he will . Politics need more men such as Yang , those with razor-sharp knowledge to back their proposals , but those who even so , put humanity first . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
