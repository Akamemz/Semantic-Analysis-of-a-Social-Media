We include some of them here and we encourage you to add your own in the comments section :\nWhat does a gun symbolize to you ? What might it symbolize to others ? What comes to mind when you think of all these symbols ?\nCould you imagine sitting down with someone who has a totally different perspective from yours on guns ? And listening ? Without interrupting ?\nWith the assumption that everyone wants to reduce gun deaths , why is the debate so polarized and why ca n't the multiple positions start from this area of common ground for policies and actions that are workable ? Do you see any common ground between those for and against guns ?\nThere seems to be a \u201c gun rights \u201d culture , a \u201c gun control \u201d culture , and maybe a \u201c gun safety \u201d culture . Are these cultures reconcilable ? How might we develop a culture that has the benefits of all these without the risks of any of them ?\nIf you were to become a gun owner , what would you do to ensure the safety of others around you ? How would you care for the weapon ? What steps would you take ?\nFor gun owners : What are the top two or three positive emotions or feelings that guns bring to you and/or your family ? What do you use your gun for ?\nFor those against guns : What feelings do you associate with firearms ? What are the factors that should be taken into account when regulating guns ?\nAre there ways to address the fears of gun advocates that would preserve their essential liberty while gaining their support for measures that would protect society better ?\nAs a gun owner or supporter of firearms , what do you think would be the type of regulation or education that would be most useful in minimizing gun violence ?\nIs the instinct to defend life , liberty and loved ones innate biologically , spiritually , or a social construct ?\nHow much has the popular media \u2013 movies , video , games , news \u2013 affected your view of guns ?\nHow do we agree to disagree on the use of guns yet focus on preventing the misuse ?\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
