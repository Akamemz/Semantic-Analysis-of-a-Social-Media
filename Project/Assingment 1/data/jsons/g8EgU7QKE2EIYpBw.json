    "content": "Police in Pasco , Washington , shot and killed Antonio Zambrano-Montes , an unarmed 35-year-old Hispanic man , on February 10 . Police shot at Zambrano-Montes 17 times , hitting him five to six times , after he allegedly threw rocks at them . The shooting , caught on video , led to protests in Pasco , where the government and police remain largely white even as the city becomes increasingly Hispanic . The shooting also drew condemnation from Mexico 's president and multiple government investigations , the New York Times reported .\nThe cellphone video shows Zambrano-Montes , a Mexican national , running away from cops after allegedly throwing rocks at police officers and cars , according to the New York Times .

They said he was increasingly depressed and disoriented after he fell from a ladder at an apple orchard and broke both his wrists . In January , he was caught in a house fire that destroyed his belongings .\n`` What I know is that he was alone , that his wife had left him , that he could n't see his daughters , '' Pedro Farias , his 32-year-old cousin , told the Times . `` I do n't know what his reasons were '' for throwing rocks at police , `` but I know all of this affected him .

The first circumstance is `` to protect their life or the life of another innocent party '' \u2014 referred to as the `` defense-of-life '' standard by police departments . The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping , but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others .\nThe logic behind the second circumstance , Klinger explained , comes from Tennessee vs. Garner . That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary . ( He 'd stolen $ 10 and a purse from a house . ) The court ruled that cops could n't shoot every felon who tried to escape . But , as Klinger said , `` they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence , and if you 've got a violent person who 's fleeing , you can shoot them to stop their flight .

The court did n't rule on whether the officers ' actions had been justified , but said police could n't justify their conduct solely based on whether their intentions were good .
