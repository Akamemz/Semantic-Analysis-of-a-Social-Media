There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\n\u201c What happens in the trial will also affect the course of the presidency . Will future presidents take the threat of impeachment seriously ? Or will they think of it as a small annoyance that isn \u2019 t worth avoiding ? Will they feel secure in resisting what has been up to now routine congressional oversight , or will they accept that bargaining with Congress is part of the rules of the game ? Will they feel emboldened to ignore the law when it comes to appropriations , or will they accept that spending law is binding ? All presidents take domestic politics into account in foreign affairs , and rightly so , but will future presidents remember this episode and feel licensed to conduct foreign affairs for their own narrow personal interest \u2014 or will they remember this episode and exercise caution ? \u201d Jonathan Bernstein , Bloomberg\n\u201c Yes , the Constitution states that public officials may only be impeached for \u2018 high crimes and misdemeanors , \u2019 but that phrase had an expansive meaning when it was written into the Constitution \u2026 The impeachment power , Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers , extends to \u2018 those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men , or , in other words , from the abuse or violation of some public trust. \u2019 ... As a member of Congress , James Madison argued that a president could be impeached for \u2018 wanton removal of meritorious officers. \u2019 \u2026 Trump \u2019 s claim that he was improperly impeached is simply wrong. \u201d Ian Millhiser , Vox\n\u201c Every impeachment trial in American history has heard from fact witnesses . And at least every impeachment trial in the last hundred years has heard fact testimony from new witnesses \u2014 those who have not previously provided evidence to the House of Representatives\u2026 The president \u2019 s allies in the Senate must ask themselves whether they would brush aside such serious allegations if someone else was occupying the White House . One suspects that they would react very differently if , for instance , President Barack Obama had been accused of asking a foreign government to investigate Mitt Romney. \u201d Noah Bookbinder , New York Times\n\u201c Republicans have successfully maneuvered around the evidence that already exists for removing Donald Trump from office . Their ability to do so probably wouldn \u2019 t change even if damning new information came out , but it \u2019 s nevertheless in their interest to keep anything new from coming out . That \u2019 s why 13 hours were spent on Tuesday rejecting Democratic amendments to subpoena new witnesses and documents at the outset of the trial\u2026 The strategy was to block Democrats from obtaining new material , and then to mock their presentation for failing to present any new material . In judging it that way , they elide the crucial question : Whether Donald Trump had admirably discharged his duties as president in the Ukraine affair. \u201d Jim Newell , Slate\n\u201c The affair thus far is markedly different from the Clinton trial two decades ago , when procedural rules were passed unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Louisiana and his Democratic counterpart , Tom Daschle of South Dakota , had resolved to work together despite the rancorous partisanship\u2026 \u201c Under the Senate \u2019 s usual rules , the minority party\u2014and even a single senator\u2014has significant power to delay or alter the proceedings . But under [ these ] impeachment-trial rules , McConnell can resolve any dispute by simple majority vote\u2014and , for the moment anyway , he has the votes to do so . That \u2019 s why Schumer and the Democrats were so determined to force votes on each amendment , in an attempt to hammer home their contention that the trial , in its present incarnation , is inherently unfair . It \u2019 s the only leverage they have , and the only real remaining suspense is whether at least four GOP senators might join Democrats next week in agreeing to seek witness testimony or subpoena more documents. \u201d Todd S. Purdum , The Atlantic\n\u201c Members of President Donald Trump \u2019 s legal team wasted no time telling a number of lies\u2026 Cipollone at one point complained that \u2018 not even [ House Intelligence Committee chair and impeachment manager Adam ] Schiff \u2019 s Republican colleagues were allowed into the SCIF , \u2019 or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility\u2026 . However , Republicans who are members of one of the three committees involved in the process had the same access as Democrats \u2026 \u201c Sekulow \u2019 s opening statement , which served as an extended complaint about process , also managed to mangle the facts ( he claimed House Democrats delayed transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a longer period of time than was actually the case ) and mischaracterize the impeachment process ( he said Trump \u2018 was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses \u2019 during the House inquiry when , in fact , the White House declined to do so ) . \u201d Aaron Rupar , Vox\nThe right is skeptical of the case against Trump and accuses Democrats of bad faith .\nThe right is skeptical of the case against Trump and accuses Democrats of bad faith .\n\u201c The House managers don \u2019 t assert that any specific action by President Trump was an abuse of power or a violation of law . They don \u2019 t deny he can delay aid to a foreign country or ask a foreign leader to investigate corruption . Presidents do that all the time . Instead they assert in their first impeachment article that Mr. Trump is guilty of \u2018 abuse of power \u2019 because he committed those acts for \u2018 corrupt purposes. \u2019 \u2026 As 21 Republican state attorneys general explained\u2026 \u2018 It can not be a legitimate basis to impeach a President for acting in a legal manner that may also be politically advantageous . Such a standard would be cause for the impeachment of virtually every President , past , present , and future \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Every President has made foreign-policy decisions that he thinks may help his re-election . That \u2019 s what President Obama did in 2012 when he asked Dmitry Medvedev to tell Vladimir Putin to ease up on missile defense until after the election . Mitt Romney was criticizing Mr. Obama for being soft on Mr. Putin , and Mr. Obama wanted a political favor from the dictator to help him win re-election . Was Mr. Obama \u2019 s motive also corrupt and thus impeachable ? We can guess what Mr. Romney thought at the time , but he didn \u2019 t say Mr. Obama should be impeached . He tried to defeat him at the ballot box . \u201d\n\u201c It is fair enough to tut-tut that a president should not conflate foreign policy and domestic politics ( something all of them do to some degree ) . And it would certainly be prudent ( even if not constitutionally required ) for presidents to leave questions about who should be investigated to the Justice Department , especially when a president \u2019 s political fortunes may be implicated . All that said , though , it makes a difference whether this president is asking the foreign power to manufacture a case against a political opponent , or whether the president is instead asking for an investigation into something that truly appears suspicious\u2026\n\u201c The president is entitled to an opportunity to show that there was reason for him to believe that a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company had retained Hunter Biden and paid him a fortune despite his lack of qualifications . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats insist that only witnesses who meet their standard of relevancy be called , contending that the Senate should only debate questions regarding what the president did and when he did it . But the presidents \u2019 lawyers note that the question of why he did what he did is also a relevant question , as he can not be removed from office for pursuing a proper public issue\u2026\n\u201c Through his lawyers , the president argues that investigating Hunter Biden and Joe Biden \u2019 s behavior in Ukraine is a legitimate public purpose because of the appearance of public corruption . That makes both men \u2019 s activities and testimony highly relevant to the inquiry , regardless of what Democrats want to be true \u2014 unless the president should be prevented from presenting his defense on his own terms . \u201d\nNevertheless , \u201c Impeachment doesn \u2019 t require a crime\u2026 The Founding-era debates about impeachment are clear that Congress was to be able to remove a president from office if he had exercised his legal powers in an abusive way . One example that came up during those debates : What if the president tacitly encouraged a crime and then pardoned the perpetrator ? ...\n\u201c Attempts to impeach presidents have thus frequently combined charges of crimes with charges of non-criminal abuses . A categorical denial of the latter class of charge would do violence to the Constitution and one of its checks on presidential misconduct . Republicans would be better off arguing that in this case the president \u2019 s behavior , while objectionable , should be left , as scheduled , to the judgment of the voters directly \u2014 an argument that already has the support of most voters in polls and accords with Senate Republicans \u2019 actual beliefs . There is no need for constitutional contortions . \u201d\n\u201c A political opposition can \u2019 t put a country through multiple congressional and media inquiries alleging Trump campaign collusion with Russia alongside Robert Mueller \u2019 s massive investigation into these charges , spend more months pushing obstruction-of-justice accusations , and now after three years of this political posse ask any serious person to believe the impeachment is only about Mr. Trump \u2019 s Biden-related conversations with the Ukrainian president or Mick Mulvaney \u2019 s refusal to testify\u2026 We read and hear constantly about Mr. Trump \u2019 s \u2018 violations. \u2019 The real violation was winning Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug .
