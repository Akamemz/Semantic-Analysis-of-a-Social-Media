    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily . \u201d\narchived recording 1 Michigan has been one of the most aggressive states when it comes to taking steps to combat the coronavirus . archived recording 2 Bans on all gatherings outside a single household , travel to in-state vacation homes , and the use of motorboats \u2014\nMichigan \u2019 s restrictions on its citizens movements have been at the center of a national debate about public health versus economic survival .\narchived recording Protests in Michigan are growing because the governor , Democrat Gretchen Whitmer , has told us citizens they can \u2019 t leave the city and stay in their summer homes . archived recording ( donald trump ) Don \u2019 t buy paint , don \u2019 t buy roses , don \u2019 t buy \u2014 I mean , she \u2019 s got all these crazy things .\nToday : A conversation with the governor who ordered those restrictions and a demonstrator who is protesting them . It \u2019 s Wednesday , April 29 . So I just want to start by asking you to introduce yourself . Your name and where you \u2019 re talking to us from .\nMy name is Phillip Campbell and I \u2019 m coming to you from Jackson County , Michigan , which is about an hour west of Detroit and about an hour away from the capital of Lansing .\nI \u2019 ve been here in this particular location for five years , but I \u2019 m a born and raised Michigander my whole life .\nYeah , 39 . I \u2019 m turning 40 in June . I had a massive party planned . I was inviting everyone I know and now I just don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s happening with that , so .\nI invited 1,000 people so , we were going to be \u2014\nI have five acres and I was going to rent Port-a-Johns . And we were going to camp . And it was going to be a multi-day bash , you know ?\n[ LAUGHS ] Well , I \u2019 ve made a lot of friends over the years .\nSo tell me about what you do for a living .\nI \u2019 m the vice president of a pest and wildlife control company . We are the ones you call if you wake up at 1:00 a.m. and there \u2019 s a bat flying around your kid \u2019 s bedroom , and you need somebody to go get it . We will climb on your roof and pull down the hornet \u2019 s nest . We will take care of the mice in your basement . We \u2019 ll do this sort of work .\nWe have about 30 employees . I \u2019 ve been with the company for about 10 years now . I think I \u2019 m one of the most senior employees there . We started when we were in the basement of the owner \u2019 s house . And now we have a very large industrial building with a depot and a shop . So it \u2019 s been cool to see that grow over the years .\nSo at this point , how would you describe the company and its success ?\nI mean , I think we \u2019 re on the threshold of breaking through to the next level of growth . We \u2019 re grossing about $ 3 million a year .\nJust this year we \u2019 re able to for the first time provide health benefits for our employees . So we \u2019 ve been working towards that for a long time , trying to get to where we have the sort of revenue and the growth that we could take on those costs , which are not insignificant , you know ? We like to think that we \u2019 re one of the companies or industries that can still offer regular old Joes without a college education a very decent middle class livelihood with insurance benefits , things like that .\nThe majority of technicians are what I would just call blue-collar people , you know ? They like to hunt , they fish . They go out on the lake on the weekends and drink beer on their pontoons and listen to music . And just regular old folks , you know ?\nMm-hm . And what kind of a living do the people generally make ?\nI mean , many of the people in our company , they provide for their families . You know , they \u2019 re the breadwinner . You know , a new technician like starting might make 35 .\nAnd then a technician who \u2019 s been with us for a while and knows what he \u2019 s doing , he can make in the high 50s or 60s . So with the 30 employees we have , we feed about 100 mouths , with their children and families . So we feel responsible for about 100 people \u2019 s well-being .\nAnd what did the first Michigan lockdown , the one ordered by Governor Whitmer \u2014 what did it mean for your pest control business ?\nHer order did not exempt us . The text of the order itself , it did not make an exemption for wildlife control , pest control . And we were preparing to shut down . And then I noticed that it said for its definition of essential services , for further clarification , see this document by the Department of Homeland Security . And we found that we were allowed to stay open .\nBut very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that , because even though we were allowed to stay open , our customer base , many of them aren \u2019 t working . So if your customers aren \u2019 t working , they \u2019 re not spending money . And it doesn \u2019 t really matter if you \u2019 re open if all the people you serve aren \u2019 t working , you know what I mean ?\nRight . I don \u2019 t want to pry too much , but if you were bringing in \u2014 I think you said almost $ 3 million a year in revenue \u2014 before this , what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off ?\nAgain , this is for a company that was allowed to stay open .\nAnd then around this time , the second shutdown order came in , which was the one that everybody started protesting about .\nYeah , the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first . This was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open . So like it said , you can \u2019 t buy paint products , you can \u2019 t buy gardening products . Because what was happening is people thinking , OK , I got to stay home , I might as well work on my house , you know ? So a lot of those people were going to Home Depot , were going to whatever to get their supplies . And then the governor said , no , you can \u2019 t get that stuff . So this was the order that said you can \u2019 t go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake , if the boat has a motor . But if it doesn \u2019 t have a motor , you can go . Things that seemed a lot more arbitrary . The one that said you can \u2019 t have someone come mow your lawn , even though they pull up in a truck , they drive the lawnmower off , they don \u2019 t touch you , they don \u2019 t go into your house . It \u2019 s just one guy mowing your lawn . You know , things that people started thinking , like , the economy \u2019 s already in freefall , is it really necessary to go this far with it ? From my own experience , if the economy takes a dump and we can \u2019 t get back to where we were , we have to cut their health insurance or we \u2019 re going to have to lay people off . We \u2019 re going to take other measures to stay afloat . I don \u2019 t know what we \u2019 re going to have to do . I don \u2019 t want to hypothesize . I don \u2019 t want my employees to listen to this and be like , what did you say is going to happen ? I don \u2019 t know , we \u2019 re going to have do something . We can \u2019 t just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline . That \u2019 s huge . What if you got a 50 percent pay cut ? It would affect your life . And so I \u2019 m thinking about the ripple effect . We take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop . Our employees take a dip . Maybe they can \u2019 t afford to pay their debts . Maybe they can \u2019 t afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever . I don \u2019 t know . I haven \u2019 t assessed the financial situation of each of my employees . But I guess what I am frustrated about \u2014 and I don \u2019 t want to minimize the risk of Covid-19 or the people who \u2019 ve had it \u2014 but as someone who \u2019 s worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up , get it to where it is , I \u2019 m frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while , and then just turn it back on when everything \u2019 s safe , and just pick up where we left off . Like , no , that \u2019 s not how business works . That \u2019 s certainly not how small business works . If you take a big enough hit , it \u2019 s hard to recover from it , you know ?\nSo I \u2019 m curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration , a protest , in Michigan of these lockdown rules ?\nI saw an event on social media , I think , or I saw people talking about it \u2014 like , hey , let \u2019 s go down to Lansing and protest . So the owner and I \u2014 work \u2019 s been slow , so we said , hey , we got time . Let \u2019 s drive down to Lansing on Thursday . The way I understood it , we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn , basically .\nThe honked horn was going to mean like , we are workers , and we want the freedom for people to be able to work . Please consider opening things back up a little more . The capitol in Lansing , it \u2019 s on a loop , so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol . So I thought that all the traffic would come in , we \u2019 d kind of loop around and we \u2019 d honk , and then we \u2019 d go back home , you know ? But they were anticipating a certain amount of people \u2014 I think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up . So it took us two hours to get to Lansing . We got in Lansing , and then we were just \u2014 Michael , it was a traffic jam . That \u2019 s what it was . It was just a big traf \u2014 it was like an organized traffic jam .\nBut what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam ? Because it \u2019 s a particular kind of traffic jam with like-minded people there to protest something .\nIt was really neat . It was nice to not feel so alone , because I was really sick of people on social media telling me I \u2019 m selfish because I don \u2019 t want the company I helped build for 10 years to just collapse .\nOh , just people on social media , my friends . People in my broader circle . You know , not people I \u2019 m necessarily close to , but I \u2019 d say I lost some friends over this , honestly . When the governor shut the economy down , I said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us . And a lot of people \u2019 s response seemed to be like , what , do you want people to die or something , you know ? And it kind of degenerated into , like , either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that . And I was really glad , because I was starting to feel kind of isolated , to see a solidarity of so many other Michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation . Afterwards , when I got home , I saw there was a lot of people with a lot of Trump stuff , and I was kind of thinking , like , no , this isn \u2019 t political . Don \u2019 t make it into a political thing because this isn \u2019 t about the governor happens to be a Democrat or a woman or something . Because I would have gone down there if it was a Republican , you know ? It wasn \u2019 t about her party affiliation . So I was frustrated \u2014\nWhat did you make of the flavor of the protest ? It seems like you didn \u2019 t see this yourself in your car , but as you \u2019 ve hinted , there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism , and pro-Trump posters , as well as people with guns , as well as some , you know , some more vulgar and extreme sentiments . Some people compared Governor Whitmer to Hitler .\nOh , like Governor Whitler ? [ LAUGHS ] Oh , I don \u2019 t know , I think that \u2019 s just juvenile . I mean , I think it \u2019 s pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to Hitler . I wish it wouldn \u2019 t have been so much anti-Whitmer , because this isn \u2019 t about like Governor Whitmer , the person , you know ? I wish that it would have been more on point and focused about \u201c let me work , \u201d you know ?\nI wonder where you fall in the political spectrum . Did you vote for Trump ? Did you vote for Whitmer ? And how did your political views apply to this event ?\nMy political views didn \u2019 t apply to this event really at all . You know , like , I would \u2019 ve been there if this was a Republican . I did vote for Trump . I don \u2019 t particularly think he \u2019 s doing that great of a job . So I \u2019 m not a gung-ho Trump supporter . I didn \u2019 t vote for Whitmer , but I didn \u2019 t like the guy running against her , either . So .\nYou \u2019 re saying you \u2019 re not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens ?\nNo , no , not at all . Not at all . The little match between President Trump and Governor Whitmer is making it more political . When Trump tweets , \u201c Liberate Michigan , \u201d when he refers to her as that woman from Michigan , obviously , that sets Governor Whitmer up as a foil against President Trump , which politicizes it . When rumors start coming out that Biden wants to consider her as V.P . material , that politicizes it . I really liked when I was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration .\nPhil , I want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing . And here \u2019 s what she said : \u201c The only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time . \u201d\nAnd she went on to say , \u201c Without aggressive measures , more people will get sick , more people will die , and our economy will suffer longer. \u201d And in her telling , the disease spreads if people are out there . If people aren \u2019 t out there , the disease doesn \u2019 t spread . So she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload . What do you think of that ?\nWell , we were willing to go along with that , because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals . We were worried about not enough beds , not enough ventilators . But the fact is the curve is flattened now . We now have hospitals , they \u2019 re not overwhelmed anymore . So what we \u2019 re saying is that was all well and good , but now , we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve . Even if infections go back up at this point , as I grant they could if we start being more economically active , it seems highly unlikely , given all the empty hospitals , that were going to get to another crush where we don \u2019 t have enough beds or something like that .\nSo I want to make sure I understand what you \u2019 re saying when you talk about where things are in Michigan . The Times has maps about where the virus is in each state . And just pulling this up , Michigan has about 38,000 infections , and there \u2019 s been about 3,300 deaths .\nSo when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown , how do you square it with those numbers ?\nWell , I square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasn \u2019 t supposed to be like , we \u2019 re going to lockdown until this goes away . What we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time , so that the health system doesn \u2019 t get overwhelmed . So I look at the total number of deaths and infections and say , OK , this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not . The hospitals do have the ability to take people in . So it seems like to me that the goal has been met . The goal is not to \u2014\nIt sounds like you \u2019 re saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in Michigan , that you \u2019 re willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy , even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit . That you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with , essentially , taking the risk of reopening .\nI think so . And again , I \u2019 m not saying just a full , like \u2014 the economy isn \u2019 t a switch , you just turn it on , everybody comes back out , you know ? But I think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols , I think they should be able to . Because the thing is , what I would like people to understand is that it \u2019 s not like either we stay home and stay safe , or we all get the coronavirus and die . It \u2019 s like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation that \u2019 s going to come . When I talk about the economy , I \u2019 m not saying I \u2019 m worried about the stock market or the financial sector . I \u2019 m talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and one \u2019 s family . So we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown , not because of Covid \u2014 negative outcomes that dwarf Covid .\nMm-hm . So we \u2019 re now talking on Monday , April 27 . And that protest was about two weeks ago .\nAnd I \u2019 m curious if you think that protest , which was one of the very first protests , had any kind of impact ?\nYeah , I think it did . I mean , this is just me kind of blue skying this , but I think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely . She started to say , we \u2019 ll let lawn service in again , we \u2019 ll let various things start .\nShe rolled back some of the more , in your mind , problematic restrictions .\nYeah . She rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game , you know ? So in that respect , I think it was helpful . I think it got the message across .\nWe plan to talk to Governor Whitmer and I wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand , what she might not be getting in this moment ?\nWell , first , I would say to her , Americans are responsible people . We \u2019 re creative people . Tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when we \u2019 re out there , and let us find a way to do it . If you think we need to be six or seven feet apart , if you think we shouldn \u2019 t have more than six people in a room , give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it . Don \u2019 t lock us down and say that we can \u2019 t provide for ourselves . That \u2019 s the most basic human right \u2014 is to provide for your own well-being . Just let us find some way to work .\nWell , Phil , thank you very much . We really appreciate your time .\nYeah , thank you . I was very happy to be with you today .\nI \u2019 m doing great . Where are you right now ? That looks like it might be home .\nYes . Yes , I \u2019 m at the governor \u2019 s residence in one of the rooms .\nIs that a sign of you that says , \u201c The Gov \u201c ?\nIt \u2019 s a beer that was named after me . So yes , that \u2019 s the poster .\n[ LAUGHS ] So governor , over the past few weeks , it feels like a lot of people have learned your name . But I sense a lot of Americans , a lot of our listeners don \u2019 t know all that much about you , and how it is you became the governor of Michigan . So in brief , what is that story ?\nYou know , I \u2019 m a lifelong Michigander . I \u2019 ve lived here my whole life . I was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a Republican , a mother who was kind of a Democrat . I decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching , and I did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown . But I think that part of my nature is when I see a problem , and I don \u2019 t see the right people there to fix it , I just kind of want to jump in and do it . The tagline of the campaign was \u201c fix the damn roads. \u201d And it wasn \u2019 t because it was poll-tested . It \u2019 s how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasn \u2019 t been attended to properly for a long period of time . And it is the most visceral daily reminder of government that \u2019 s not getting the fundamentals right .\nThat was kind of the call to action . And I won by almost 10 points after Donald Trump had won my state by less than 11,000 votes just two years before , I think , because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right .\nRight . So it \u2019 s fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the American economy .\nCorrect . [ LAUGHS ] To the contrary , I went out of my way to not go down that path . And so to be right here in this moment , in the midst of a global pandemic , to be trying to pull people together \u2014 where things have gotten so polarized in ways that I think many people would say they couldn \u2019 t have ever predicted , if they were being honest \u2014 is kind of surreal .\nSo let \u2019 s talk about how that happened , how you have gotten to this point where there \u2019 s so much polarization over your decision-making . As the pandemic unfolds , soon enough , you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of Michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown .\nBut then at a certain point , you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different , right ? Banning travel to second homes , banning motor-boating , limiting what kind of non-essential goods stores can sell . And governor , what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions ?\nSo what we knew at the time was that Covid-19 was ravaging southeast Michigan .\nWe also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population \u2014 10th largest population , but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths . We also know that Covid-19 doesn \u2019 t recognize boundaries of a county . That this is a disease that is highly communicable . There are studies that will tell you Covid-19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface . And so as the weather starts to warm up here in Michigan , we know people want to head north and go to the lake .\nOne of the lakes \u2014 we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes . And the more people that are on the road , the more likely Covid-19 will be spread at a gas station . I often would invoke the visual of that gas pump . So you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because they \u2019 re going out to get groceries , or they \u2019 re going out to pick up medication . The more people that are on the road , the more likely Covid-19 spreads to other parts of the state , too . And that \u2019 s why these restrictions made sense .\nSo your thinking was , let \u2019 s shut down anything that might contribute to the spread , and let \u2019 s make sure that people in the most populous parts of Michigan don \u2019 t end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state , where outdoor activities are concentrated . And let \u2019 s do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme .\nLet \u2019 s shut down what \u2019 s not life-sustaining activity . That was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states .\nSo you think those second wave measures were the right call ?\nGovernor , the protests that broke out in your state , I \u2019 m sure you were aware of them because you \u2019 re in Lansing . Protesters very much by design came to you . Did you sympathize at all with the protesters , who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous , to be unfair , to be \u2014 in their minds \u2014 undemocratic ?\nI \u2019 ll say this . I respect people \u2019 s right to disagree with me . I do . And I will defend anyone \u2019 s right to say what they want to say . Their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that I have a great deal of respect for .\nThe fact of the matter is , congregation is the biggest threat to containing Covid-19 . Because when people come from all different parts of the state , congregate , don \u2019 t observe C.D.C . best practices , and then go back to all parts of the state , that \u2019 s precisely what we \u2019 re hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of Michigan .\nBut when you look at these protests , there were a variety of different political groups that came together . It had a rally feel to it . It was right outside the office . I saw , I watched a bit of it . People were open carrying automatic rifles . There were demonstrations , anti-choice demonstrations . They \u2019 re displaying Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism , and I think very partisan rhetoric . Was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that I \u2019 ve asked people to make .\nWell , yesterday , Governor , I spoke with a man who was at that protest . He stayed in his car . His name was Phil Campbell . He manages a kind of moderate-sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions . And he said that he didn \u2019 t arrive as a partisan . That he would have gone to Lansing and protested whether you were a Democrat or a Republican . And in his mind , the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs , right ? He says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they can \u2019 t afford to provide it much longer . I mean , what do you say to someone like that \u2014 who says this is not about politics , this is not about you being a Democrat , this is not about the Tea Party ? This is about a view that this is just not right ?\nThe reality is , unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re-engage from .\nWhat our modeling told us , we would have 220,000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week . We have 3,000 people who are hospitalized . It \u2019 s worked . And the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing . It hasn \u2019 t been easy , but they \u2019 ve stepped up to do it . And we \u2019 ve saved lives in the process .\nThis gentleman I spoke with , Phil , the protester , his ultimate message \u2014 and it was directed very much at you as governor \u2014 is , trust us . Let us start to go back to work not like a band-aid being ripped off , but gradually . And trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines . And I think his question to you would be , do you trust Michiganders to do that ?\nI am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis . They \u2019 ve stepped up . They \u2019 ve made sacrifices . I have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state . But we have a duty to make sure that we get this right .\nAnd it \u2019 s got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders . And that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re working to do . I have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re-engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave . Because whether Phil and I agree on how quickly that should be done or not , I think we can both agree \u2014 I hope so \u2014 that none of us ever wants to do this again . You know , in states that are moving , some would say too fast , one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that it \u2019 s safe to re-engage . And so they \u2019 ve lifted the protections for small business while you \u2019 re in a crisis . And yet , the public \u2019 s not coming out to patronize . And that could be even worse for small business . So what we want to do is get it right . And that means working with the business community and public health . And turning up the dial together so we don \u2019 t have to turn it back .\nWell , let \u2019 s talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how you \u2019 re thinking about that . I mean , is there a data set you \u2019 re looking at ? Is there a set of measurements you \u2019 re monitoring ? And I \u2019 m curious \u2014 and I \u2019 m sure lots of people Michigan are , too \u2014 what \u2019 s the thing or things that trigger the reopening ?\nSo we \u2019 ve started to reengage . We are looking , of course , at rolling averages on hospitalizations . We are looking at our ability to ramp up testing . We need to build out when it comes to tracing , so that if someone does test positive for Covid-19 , that we \u2019 re able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading . I would also add that we in Michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk , asking questions like , is the work done in a region of our state that \u2019 s been devastated by Covid-19 , or a region that has been untouched by Covid-19 ?\nDoes the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery ? Is the work done indoors or outdoors ? That makes a difference .\nMm-hm . Right , one of the examples that I think Phil gave was around this idea of , is there a work that can be done \u2014 that just feels fundamentally safer by nature \u2014 that those might come back soon ?\nAnd I think that \u2019 s interesting , because what I want to make sure we do is go with data , and make sure that as we are reengaging , we \u2019 re continually measuring . I know Phil doesn \u2019 t want to be back in a stay home order in August and neither do I .\nAnd so I want to get this right for him , for his employees \u2014 lawnscaping , lawn care , that is already permitted . That was in our first wave that I announced on Friday . In this next one , we could have construction \u2014 that is often in big spaces outdoors with P.P.E . and the protocols necessary . That could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks , or separators between workers who can \u2019 t be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators , for instance . And so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves .\nYou know , we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor , it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in Michigan . And through these actions that you \u2019 ve taken in response to the pandemic , you have become a national figure , a national Democratic figure , right ? You \u2019 re , whether you wanted to or not , sparring with the president . And whether it \u2019 s fairly or unfairly , you \u2019 re now seen through a partisan lens , as a partisan figure . Are you comfortable now in that role ?\nNo ! [ LAUGHS ] I \u2019 m not . I mean , you know , I was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the President of the United States . I didn \u2019 t ask for that . I did not like it . I didn \u2019 t sleep \u2014\n\u2014 frankly , because I was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that I need for Michigan .\nHm . You fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic ?\nYeah . And I think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made .\nYeah . That if you \u2019 re not nice , you might not get the help you need . And so I \u2019 ve bent over backwards to try to smooth that over , not throwing a punch back . I would hate for anyone in Michigan to not have the help they need because I \u2019 m not popular with the president for some reason .\nDo you worry that with the divided state of this country , some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions ?\nI think that \u2019 s the unfortunate reality that we live with . I do think , though , that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it , that we \u2019 re going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives .\nThe hard thing about public health is when you do it well , you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise .\nBut we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed , and where we are today , that there \u2019 s no question lives were saved . There \u2019 s no question that these actions made a difference . And that \u2019 s what centered everything that we \u2019 ve done .\nNot the partisan stuff , not the fear of that , but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that it \u2019 s there when we all need it .\nWell , Governor Whitmer , I want to thank you very much for your time . And I hope you \u2019 re getting a little more sleep now .\nThank you . We appreciate it . We \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today . On Tuesday , the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States reached 1 million , meaning that roughly one in every 330 Americans has tested positive for the virus . But The Times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of Americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies . And \u2014\narchived recording ( nancy pelosi ) We had intended to come back next week . It has been previously scheduled . But once the Capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff , but the custodians , the people who maintain the Capitol , the press who cover us , the staff of the actual legislative chamber , there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off .\nThe House of Representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to Washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country . The Senate , however , is expected to reconvene in Washington on Monday . Finally .\nIn New York , jets from the Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy Blue Angels flew over the city on Tuesday in a tribute to medical workers and first responders involved in fighting the pandemic .",
    "content_original": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\narchived recording 1 Michigan has been one of the most aggressive states when it comes to taking steps to combat the coronavirus. archived recording 2 Bans on all gatherings outside a single household, travel to in-state vacation homes, and the use of motorboats \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMichigan\u2019s restrictions on its citizens movements have been at the center of a national debate about public health versus economic survival.\n\narchived recording Protests in Michigan are growing because the governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, has told us citizens they can\u2019t leave the city and stay in their summer homes. archived recording (donald trump) Don\u2019t buy paint, don\u2019t buy roses, don\u2019t buy \u2014 I mean, she\u2019s got all these crazy things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with the governor who ordered those restrictions and a demonstrator who is protesting them. It\u2019s Wednesday, April 29. So I just want to start by asking you to introduce yourself. Your name and where you\u2019re talking to us from.\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy name is Phillip Campbell and I\u2019m coming to you from Jackson County, Michigan, which is about an hour west of Detroit and about an hour away from the capital of Lansing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd how long have you lived there?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI\u2019ve been here in this particular location for five years, but I\u2019m a born and raised Michigander my whole life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd did you say how old you are?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, 39. I\u2019m turning 40 in June. I had a massive party planned. I was inviting everyone I know and now I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with that, so.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen you say massive, how massive?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI invited 1,000 people so, we were going to be \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nphil campbell\n\nI have five acres and I was going to rent Port-a-Johns. And we were going to camp. And it was going to be a multi-day bash, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt turns out you\u2019re very popular, too.\n\nphil campbell\n\n[LAUGHS] Well, I\u2019ve made a lot of friends over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo tell me about what you do for a living.\n\nphil campbell\n\nI\u2019m the vice president of a pest and wildlife control company. We are the ones you call if you wake up at 1:00 a.m. and there\u2019s a bat flying around your kid\u2019s bedroom, and you need somebody to go get it. We will climb on your roof and pull down the hornet\u2019s nest. We will take care of the mice in your basement. We\u2019ll do this sort of work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nWe have about 30 employees. I\u2019ve been with the company for about 10 years now. I think I\u2019m one of the most senior employees there. We started when we were in the basement of the owner\u2019s house. And now we have a very large industrial building with a depot and a shop. So it\u2019s been cool to see that grow over the years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, how would you describe the company and its success?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, I think we\u2019re on the threshold of breaking through to the next level of growth. We\u2019re grossing about $3 million a year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nJust this year we\u2019re able to for the first time provide health benefits for our employees. So we\u2019ve been working towards that for a long time, trying to get to where we have the sort of revenue and the growth that we could take on those costs, which are not insignificant, you know? We like to think that we\u2019re one of the companies or industries that can still offer regular old Joes without a college education a very decent middle class livelihood with insurance benefits, things like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe majority of technicians are what I would just call blue-collar people, you know? They like to hunt, they fish. They go out on the lake on the weekends and drink beer on their pontoons and listen to music. And just regular old folks, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. And what kind of a living do the people generally make?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI mean, many of the people in our company, they provide for their families. You know, they\u2019re the breadwinner. You know, a new technician like starting might make 35.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then a technician who\u2019s been with us for a while and knows what he\u2019s doing, he can make in the high 50s or 60s. So with the 30 employees we have, we feed about 100 mouths, with their children and families. So we feel responsible for about 100 people\u2019s well-being.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did the first Michigan lockdown, the one ordered by Governor Whitmer \u2014 what did it mean for your pest control business?\n\nphil campbell\n\nHer order did not exempt us. The text of the order itself, it did not make an exemption for wildlife control, pest control. And we were preparing to shut down. And then I noticed that it said for its definition of essential services, for further clarification, see this document by the Department of Homeland Security. And we found that we were allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGot it.\n\nphil campbell\n\nBut very quickly after that we had to furlough a couple people after that, because even though we were allowed to stay open, our customer base, many of them aren\u2019t working. So if your customers aren\u2019t working, they\u2019re not spending money. And it doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re open if all the people you serve aren\u2019t working, you know what I mean?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I don\u2019t want to pry too much, but if you were bringing in \u2014 I think you said almost $3 million a year in revenue \u2014 before this, what did it start to look like once the lockdown was in place and the calls from customers began to taper off?\n\nphil campbell\n\nAt first, it was a 50 percent drop.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAgain, this is for a company that was allowed to stay open.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nphil campbell\n\nAnd then around this time, the second shutdown order came in, which was the one that everybody started protesting about.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTell me what you mean.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, the second shutdown order just ramped down on the first. This was the one that went in and shut particular sections of stores that were still open. So like it said, you can\u2019t buy paint products, you can\u2019t buy gardening products. Because what was happening is people thinking, OK, I got to stay home, I might as well work on my house, you know? So a lot of those people were going to Home Depot, were going to whatever to get their supplies. And then the governor said, no, you can\u2019t get that stuff. So this was the order that said you can\u2019t go out on a lake by yourself in your boat in your private lake, if the boat has a motor. But if it doesn\u2019t have a motor, you can go. Things that seemed a lot more arbitrary. The one that said you can\u2019t have someone come mow your lawn, even though they pull up in a truck, they drive the lawnmower off, they don\u2019t touch you, they don\u2019t go into your house. It\u2019s just one guy mowing your lawn. You know, things that people started thinking, like, the economy\u2019s already in freefall, is it really necessary to go this far with it? From my own experience, if the economy takes a dump and we can\u2019t get back to where we were, we have to cut their health insurance or we\u2019re going to have to lay people off. We\u2019re going to take other measures to stay afloat. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to have to do. I don\u2019t want to hypothesize. I don\u2019t want my employees to listen to this and be like, what did you say is going to happen? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re going to have do something. We can\u2019t just suddenly take a 30 percent to 50 percent decline. That\u2019s huge. What if you got a 50 percent pay cut? It would affect your life. And so I\u2019m thinking about the ripple effect. We take a 30 percent to 50 percent drop. Our employees take a dip. Maybe they can\u2019t afford to pay their debts. Maybe they can\u2019t afford to pay their own mortgages or whatever. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t assessed the financial situation of each of my employees. But I guess what I am frustrated about \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to minimize the risk of Covid-19 or the people who\u2019ve had it \u2014 but as someone who\u2019s worked for 10 years in this business trying to build it up, get it to where it is, I\u2019m frustrated with the attitude of some people that we can just shut it off for a while, and then just turn it back on when everything\u2019s safe, and just pick up where we left off. Like, no, that\u2019s not how business works. That\u2019s certainly not how small business works. If you take a big enough hit, it\u2019s hard to recover from it, you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I\u2019m curious when you first hear about the possibility of a public demonstration, a protest, in Michigan of these lockdown rules?\n\nphil campbell\n\nI saw an event on social media, I think, or I saw people talking about it \u2014 like, hey, let\u2019s go down to Lansing and protest. So the owner and I \u2014 work\u2019s been slow, so we said, hey, we got time. Let\u2019s drive down to Lansing on Thursday. The way I understood it, we were going to drive by the capitol and honk our horn, basically.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was that honked horn going to mean?\n\nphil campbell\n\nThe honked horn was going to mean like, we are workers, and we want the freedom for people to be able to work. Please consider opening things back up a little more. The capitol in Lansing, it\u2019s on a loop, so you drive around in like a circle around the capitol. So I thought that all the traffic would come in, we\u2019d kind of loop around and we\u2019d honk, and then we\u2019d go back home, you know? But they were anticipating a certain amount of people \u2014 I think 10 times more than they anticipated showed up. So it took us two hours to get to Lansing. We got in Lansing, and then we were just \u2014 Michael, it was a traffic jam. That\u2019s what it was. It was just a big traf \u2014 it was like an organized traffic jam.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut what did it feel like to be in that traffic jam? Because it\u2019s a particular kind of traffic jam with like-minded people there to protest something.\n\nphil campbell\n\nIt was really neat. It was nice to not feel so alone, because I was really sick of people on social media telling me I\u2019m selfish because I don\u2019t want the company I helped build for 10 years to just collapse.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWho\u2019s calling you selfish, do you feel like?\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, just people on social media, my friends. People in my broader circle. You know, not people I\u2019m necessarily close to, but I\u2019d say I lost some friends over this, honestly. When the governor shut the economy down, I said this is going to be very hard on businesses and this is going to be very hard on us. And a lot of people\u2019s response seemed to be like, what, do you want people to die or something, you know? And it kind of degenerated into, like, either you want people to die or you hate my business and stuff like that. And I was really glad, because I was starting to feel kind of isolated, to see a solidarity of so many other Michiganders who were similarly frustrated at the situation. Afterwards, when I got home, I saw there was a lot of people with a lot of Trump stuff, and I was kind of thinking, like, no, this isn\u2019t political. Don\u2019t make it into a political thing because this isn\u2019t about the governor happens to be a Democrat or a woman or something. Because I would have gone down there if it was a Republican, you know? It wasn\u2019t about her party affiliation. So I was frustrated \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat did you make of the flavor of the protest? It seems like you didn\u2019t see this yourself in your car, but as you\u2019ve hinted, there were strong strains of libertarianism and conservatism, and pro-Trump posters, as well as people with guns, as well as some, you know, some more vulgar and extreme sentiments. Some people compared Governor Whitmer to Hitler.\n\nphil campbell\n\nOh, like Governor Whitler? [LAUGHS] Oh, I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s just juvenile. I mean, I think it\u2019s pretty juvenile in public discourse when the only thing you go to is compare your opponent to Hitler. I wish it wouldn\u2019t have been so much anti-Whitmer, because this isn\u2019t about like Governor Whitmer, the person, you know? I wish that it would have been more on point and focused about \u201clet me work,\u201d you know?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder where you fall in the political spectrum. Did you vote for Trump? Did you vote for Whitmer? And how did your political views apply to this event?\n\nphil campbell\n\nMy political views didn\u2019t apply to this event really at all. You know, like, I would\u2019ve been there if this was a Republican. I did vote for Trump. I don\u2019t particularly think he\u2019s doing that great of a job. So I\u2019m not a gung-ho Trump supporter. I didn\u2019t vote for Whitmer, but I didn\u2019t like the guy running against her, either. So.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou\u2019re saying you\u2019re not seeing this crisis or the lockdowns through a political lens?\n\nphil campbell\n\nNo, no, not at all. Not at all. The little match between President Trump and Governor Whitmer is making it more political. When Trump tweets, \u201cLiberate Michigan,\u201d when he refers to her as that woman from Michigan, obviously, that sets Governor Whitmer up as a foil against President Trump, which politicizes it. When rumors start coming out that Biden wants to consider her as V.P. material, that politicizes it. I really liked when I was there that it simply seemed like a spontaneous expression of working class frustration.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nPhil, I want to tick through what your governor said when she began this process of locking down the state and basically enforcing social distancing. And here\u2019s what she said: \u201cThe only tool we have to fight the virus at this moment and to support our health care system is to give them the opportunity by buying some time.\u201d\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd she went on to say, \u201cWithout aggressive measures, more people will get sick, more people will die, and our economy will suffer longer.\u201d And in her telling, the disease spreads if people are out there. If people aren\u2019t out there, the disease doesn\u2019t spread. So she is making the case in the beginning that these sacrifices are required to prevent a system overload. What do you think of that?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, we were willing to go along with that, because we were all expecting this huge crunch on all our hospitals. We were worried about not enough beds, not enough ventilators. But the fact is the curve is flattened now. We now have hospitals, they\u2019re not overwhelmed anymore. So what we\u2019re saying is that was all well and good, but now, we can start to open up again because we flattened the curve. Even if infections go back up at this point, as I grant they could if we start being more economically active, it seems highly unlikely, given all the empty hospitals, that were going to get to another crush where we don\u2019t have enough beds or something like that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re saying when you talk about where things are in Michigan. The Times has maps about where the virus is in each state. And just pulling this up, Michigan has about 38,000 infections, and there\u2019s been about 3,300 deaths.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, we\u2019re the third highest state, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo when you talk about your frustrations with the different phases of this lockdown, how do you square it with those numbers?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, I square it because my understanding is that the lockdown wasn\u2019t supposed to be like, we\u2019re going to lockdown until this goes away. What we were told was that this lockdown was to distribute those amount of cases over a longer period of time, so that the health system doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed. So I look at the total number of deaths and infections and say, OK, this thing is here to stay whether we like it or not. The hospitals do have the ability to take people in. So it seems like to me that the goal has been met. The goal is not to \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re saying that if we assume that the measures taken so far have flattened the curve to some degree in Michigan, that you\u2019re willing to accept the risks of restarting the economy, even if that means that the curve might go up a little bit. That you think that so far the measures taken have done enough to merit that kind of experimentation with, essentially, taking the risk of reopening.\n\nphil campbell\n\nI think so. And again, I\u2019m not saying just a full, like \u2014 the economy isn\u2019t a switch, you just turn it on, everybody comes back out, you know? But I think people who want to work and can work in a way that is maintaining safe protocols, I think they should be able to. Because the thing is, what I would like people to understand is that it\u2019s not like either we stay home and stay safe, or we all get the coronavirus and die. It\u2019s like staying home and nobody working has its own inherent risks and dangers and devastation that\u2019s going to come. When I talk about the economy, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m worried about the stock market or the financial sector. I\u2019m talking about the ability of the average person to provide sustenance for himself and one\u2019s family. So we could have negative outcomes because of the shutdown, not because of Covid \u2014 negative outcomes that dwarf Covid.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. So we\u2019re now talking on Monday, April 27. And that protest was about two weeks ago.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I\u2019m curious if you think that protest, which was one of the very first protests, had any kind of impact?\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, I think it did. I mean, this is just me kind of blue skying this, but I think it let her see that she only had a limited amount of political capital that she could keep carrying this out indefinitely. She started to say, we\u2019ll let lawn service in again, we\u2019ll let various things start.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nShe rolled back some of the more, in your mind, problematic restrictions.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah. She rolled back some of the more problematic restrictions and she started talking about an end game, you know? So in that respect, I think it was helpful. I think it got the message across.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe plan to talk to Governor Whitmer and I wonder what you most want to communicate to her about what you think she may not understand, what she might not be getting in this moment?\n\nphil campbell\n\nWell, first, I would say to her, Americans are responsible people. We\u2019re creative people. Tell us what social distancing guidelines you think we should be maintaining when we\u2019re out there, and let us find a way to do it. If you think we need to be six or seven feet apart, if you think we shouldn\u2019t have more than six people in a room, give us a safe paradigm of personal behavior and let us work within it. Don\u2019t lock us down and say that we can\u2019t provide for ourselves. That\u2019s the most basic human right \u2014 is to provide for your own well-being. Just let us find some way to work.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Phil, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time.\n\nphil campbell\n\nYeah, thank you. I was very happy to be with you today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Hi, there.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor Whitmer, it\u2019s Michael Barbaro. How are you?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI\u2019m doing all right. How are you doing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI\u2019m doing great. Where are you right now? That looks like it might be home.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes. Yes, I\u2019m at the governor\u2019s residence in one of the rooms.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that a sign of you that says, \u201cThe Gov\u201c?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIt\u2019s a beer that was named after me. So yes, that\u2019s the poster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the beer is called The Gov?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYep.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs that any good?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nIt is pretty good. It\u2019s an Indian pale ale.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS] So governor, over the past few weeks, it feels like a lot of people have learned your name. But I sense a lot of Americans, a lot of our listeners don\u2019t know all that much about you, and how it is you became the governor of Michigan. So in brief, what is that story?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYou know, I\u2019m a lifelong Michigander. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. I was brought up in a household with a father who was kind of a Republican, a mother who was kind of a Democrat. I decided to run for governor after spending some time practicing law and teaching, and I did a stint as a prosecutor in my hometown. But I think that part of my nature is when I see a problem, and I don\u2019t see the right people there to fix it, I just kind of want to jump in and do it. The tagline of the campaign was \u201cfix the damn roads.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t because it was poll-tested. It\u2019s how everyone in the state talks about their frustration with infrastructure that hasn\u2019t been attended to properly for a long period of time. And it is the most visceral daily reminder of government that\u2019s not getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThat was kind of the call to action. And I won by almost 10 points after Donald Trump had won my state by less than 11,000 votes just two years before, I think, because we really were trying to rally around getting the fundamentals right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So it\u2019s fair to say that you did not run in that race for governor as somebody who would become a polarizing and partisan figure in a national debate over the future of the American economy.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nCorrect. [LAUGHS] To the contrary, I went out of my way to not go down that path. And so to be right here in this moment, in the midst of a global pandemic, to be trying to pull people together \u2014 where things have gotten so polarized in ways that I think many people would say they couldn\u2019t have ever predicted, if they were being honest \u2014 is kind of surreal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how that happened, how you have gotten to this point where there\u2019s so much polarization over your decision-making. As the pandemic unfolds, soon enough, you begin imposing restrictions on the movement of Michigan residents and what feels like a pretty standard version of a lockdown.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut then at a certain point, you introduce a second wave of restrictions that are a little bit different, right? Banning travel to second homes, banning motor-boating, limiting what kind of non-essential goods stores can sell. And governor, what was your thinking there with that second wave of restrictions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo what we knew at the time was that Covid-19 was ravaging southeast Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWe also know that we have an incredibly high death count compared to our population \u2014 10th largest population, but the third highest number of positive cases and number of deaths. We also know that Covid-19 doesn\u2019t recognize boundaries of a county. That this is a disease that is highly communicable. There are studies that will tell you Covid-19 can stay active and communicable for 72 hours on a stainless steel surface. And so as the weather starts to warm up here in Michigan, we know people want to head north and go to the lake.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nOne of the lakes \u2014 we got lots of beautiful freshwater lakes. And the more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 will be spread at a gas station. I often would invoke the visual of that gas pump. So you think about all the nurses and doctors and people that have to touch that gas pump because they\u2019re going out to get groceries, or they\u2019re going out to pick up medication. The more people that are on the road, the more likely Covid-19 spreads to other parts of the state, too. And that\u2019s why these restrictions made sense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo your thinking was, let\u2019s shut down anything that might contribute to the spread, and let\u2019s make sure that people in the most populous parts of Michigan don\u2019t end up basically exporting it to less populous parts of the state, where outdoor activities are concentrated. And let\u2019s do this even if it might seem a little bit extreme.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nLet\u2019s shut down what\u2019s not life-sustaining activity. That was the thought process of why we went more aggressive than some other states.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you think those second wave measures were the right call?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor, the protests that broke out in your state, I\u2019m sure you were aware of them because you\u2019re in Lansing. Protesters very much by design came to you. Did you sympathize at all with the protesters, who said that they found these restrictions to be too onerous, to be unfair, to be \u2014 in their minds \u2014 undemocratic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI\u2019ll say this. I respect people\u2019s right to disagree with me. I do. And I will defend anyone\u2019s right to say what they want to say. Their ability and right to do that is absolutely something that I have a great deal of respect for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe fact of the matter is, congregation is the biggest threat to containing Covid-19. Because when people come from all different parts of the state, congregate, don\u2019t observe C.D.C. best practices, and then go back to all parts of the state, that\u2019s precisely what we\u2019re hoping to avoid in terms of continuous transmission and growth in other parts of Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut when you look at these protests, there were a variety of different political groups that came together. It had a rally feel to it. It was right outside the office. I saw, I watched a bit of it. People were open carrying automatic rifles. There were demonstrations, anti-choice demonstrations. They\u2019re displaying Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism, and I think very partisan rhetoric. Was more about a political statement rather than a statement of the sacrifices that I\u2019ve asked people to make.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, yesterday, Governor, I spoke with a man who was at that protest. He stayed in his car. His name was Phil Campbell. He manages a kind of moderate-sized business that he says is suffering right now under these restrictions. And he said that he didn\u2019t arrive as a partisan. That he would have gone to Lansing and protested whether you were a Democrat or a Republican. And in his mind, the shutdown is creating its own health and safety costs, right? He says his employees may soon lose their health insurance because business is suffering so much they can\u2019t afford to provide it much longer. I mean, what do you say to someone like that \u2014 who says this is not about politics, this is not about you being a Democrat, this is not about the Tea Party? This is about a view that this is just not right?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe reality is, unrestrained activity would have made what was a hard time a catastrophe that would have taken a lot longer to start to re-engage from.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nWhat our modeling told us, we would have 220,000 people who would need to be hospitalized this week. We have 3,000 people who are hospitalized. It\u2019s worked. And the vast majority of people are doing their part and doing the right thing. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but they\u2019ve stepped up to do it. And we\u2019ve saved lives in the process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis gentleman I spoke with, Phil, the protester, his ultimate message \u2014 and it was directed very much at you as governor \u2014 is, trust us. Let us start to go back to work not like a band-aid being ripped off, but gradually. And trust us to be able to work and follow social distancing guidelines. And I think his question to you would be, do you trust Michiganders to do that?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI am so inspired by what the people of this state have done in this crisis. They\u2019ve stepped up. They\u2019ve made sacrifices. I have incredible faith and confidence in the people of the state. But we have a duty to make sure that we get this right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd it\u2019s got to be guided by the best medical experts as well as business leaders. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working to do. I have a council of business leaders and medical leaders who are helping us determine how do we start to re-engage our economy in a way that avoids a second wave. Because whether Phil and I agree on how quickly that should be done or not, I think we can both agree \u2014 I hope so \u2014 that none of us ever wants to do this again. You know, in states that are moving, some would say too fast, one of the issues that small business is confronting is that the public is not confident that it\u2019s safe to re-engage. And so they\u2019ve lifted the protections for small business while you\u2019re in a crisis. And yet, the public\u2019s not coming out to patronize. And that could be even worse for small business. So what we want to do is get it right. And that means working with the business community and public health. And turning up the dial together so we don\u2019t have to turn it back.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, let\u2019s talk about how it is that you get it right when it comes to reopening and how you\u2019re thinking about that. I mean, is there a data set you\u2019re looking at? Is there a set of measurements you\u2019re monitoring? And I\u2019m curious \u2014 and I\u2019m sure lots of people Michigan are, too \u2014 what\u2019s the thing or things that trigger the reopening?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo we\u2019ve started to reengage. We are looking, of course, at rolling averages on hospitalizations. We are looking at our ability to ramp up testing. We need to build out when it comes to tracing, so that if someone does test positive for Covid-19, that we\u2019re able to trace all their contacts and keep it from spreading. I would also add that we in Michigan are assessing different sectors of our economy for risk, asking questions like, is the work done in a region of our state that\u2019s been devastated by Covid-19, or a region that has been untouched by Covid-19?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nDoes the type of work require that multiple people use the same instruments or machinery? Is the work done indoors or outdoors? That makes a difference.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm. Right, one of the examples that I think Phil gave was around this idea of, is there a work that can be done \u2014 that just feels fundamentally safer by nature \u2014 that those might come back soon?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nSo you use the word \u201cfeels.\u201d Feels safer.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s interesting, because what I want to make sure we do is go with data, and make sure that as we are reengaging, we\u2019re continually measuring. I know Phil doesn\u2019t want to be back in a stay home order in August and neither do I.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nAnd so I want to get this right for him, for his employees \u2014 lawnscaping, lawn care, that is already permitted. That was in our first wave that I announced on Friday. In this next one, we could have construction \u2014 that is often in big spaces outdoors with P.P.E. and the protocols necessary. That could be a lower risk one that we can mitigate the risk further through protocols around face masks, or separators between workers who can\u2019t be six feet apart but can have plexiglass separators, for instance. And so all of these are pieces to starting to turn the dial up and what it looks like in waves.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, we started by talking to you about the fact that when you first ran for governor, it was as somebody literally talking about fixing the roads and fixing infrastructure in Michigan. And through these actions that you\u2019ve taken in response to the pandemic, you have become a national figure, a national Democratic figure, right? You\u2019re, whether you wanted to or not, sparring with the president. And whether it\u2019s fairly or unfairly, you\u2019re now seen through a partisan lens, as a partisan figure. Are you comfortable now in that role?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNo! [LAUGHS] I\u2019m not. I mean, you know, I was thrown into the national spotlight being criticized or attacked by the President of the United States. I didn\u2019t ask for that. I did not like it. I didn\u2019t sleep \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n\u2014 frankly, because I was worried that this would preclude my ability to get the help that I need for Michigan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. You fear that you might actually suffer some kind of retribution that might make it harder to get through this pandemic?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. And I think that that was a legitimate fear with some of the statements that have been made.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBy the president?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nYeah. That if you\u2019re not nice, you might not get the help you need. And so I\u2019ve bent over backwards to try to smooth that over, not throwing a punch back. I would hate for anyone in Michigan to not have the help they need because I\u2019m not popular with the president for some reason.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you worry that with the divided state of this country, some of your constituents will come away from this pandemic seeing your actions as partisan no matter what happens and no matter what your intentions?\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nI think that\u2019s the unfortunate reality that we live with. I do think, though, that when we have gotten through this when we look back on it, that we\u2019re going to be comfortable in the fact that the decisions that were made save lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nThe hard thing about public health is when you do it well, you never know how many lives would have been lost otherwise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nBut we can see it when you look at the curves where we were headed, and where we are today, that there\u2019s no question lives were saved. There\u2019s no question that these actions made a difference. And that\u2019s what centered everything that we\u2019ve done.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\nNot the partisan stuff, not the fear of that, but the determination to do everything in our power to save lives and to keep our health care system working so that it\u2019s there when we all need it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, Governor Whitmer, I want to thank you very much for your time. And I hope you\u2019re getting a little more sleep now.\n\ngretchen whitmer\n\n[LAUGHS] No, but I\u2019ll sleep sometime. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you. We appreciate it. We\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States reached 1 million, meaning that roughly one in every 330 Americans has tested positive for the virus. But The Times reports that the actual number of infections is even higher since thousands of Americans have never been tested because of a shortage of testing supplies. And \u2014\n\narchived recording (nancy pelosi) We had intended to come back next week. It has been previously scheduled. But once the Capitol physician told us that it was not a proper for us to do that in the interest of not only members and staff, but the custodians, the people who maintain the Capitol, the press who cover us, the staff of the actual legislative chamber, there was no choice for us but to say we will put this off.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe House of Representatives has canceled plans to call lawmakers back into session after members complained that returning to Washington would pose an unnecessary health risk and set a bad example for the country. The Senate, however, is expected to reconvene in Washington on Monday. Finally.\n\narchived recording [JETS FLYING]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn New York, jets from the Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy Blue Angels flew over the city on Tuesday in a tribute to medical workers and first responders involved in fighting the pandemic.\n\narchived recording [JETS FLYING]\n\nmichael barbaro",
