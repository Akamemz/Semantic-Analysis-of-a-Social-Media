Kennedy and other high-profile Democrats , Ms. Cutter can sense moments in the campaign when there is blood in the water and it \u2019 s time to go for the jugular .\nLast week , she came under intense partisan fire for suggesting that Mr. Romney may have committed a felony by having his name remain on Bain Capital \u2019 s SEC filings years after he said he ended active involvement with the private equity firm .\nThe remark has been the source of escalating acrimony between the Obama and Romney camps .\nMr. Romney has denied any wrongdoing and personally demanded an apology , but the Obama campaign insists that Ms. Cutter isn \u2019 t walking back her comments in any way .\n\u201c She raised the question about whether he was misleading the American people or misleading himself to the SEC , \u201d Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The only person who is walking anything back or has changed his tune is Mitt Romney , who is now saying that he was no longer involved in day-to-day operations \u201d at Bain after 1999 .\nEither way , the damage had been done , with Ms. Cutter \u2019 s \u201c felony \u201d remark having gone viral on liberal and conservative blogs alike .\nMs. Cutter can thank Mr. Clinton , an early political mentor and master of rapid response , for her aggressive , shoot-from-the-hip style , having served him as deputy communications director in the White House in the 1990s . But her abrasive style has proved a liability at times .\n\u201c She can be very tough and hard-charging . Once you agree on a plan , she is very good on making sure everybody abides by it , \u201d said one longtime Democratic aide , who didn \u2019 t mean it as a compliment .\nOthers give her credit for keeping disparate Democratic factions focused . During the health care debate , Ms. Cutter served as Mr. Obama \u2019 s point woman on Capitol Hill , making sure everyone remained engaged and enthusiastic despite the firestorm of criticism against congressional Democrats at town-hall meetings across the country in the summer of 2010 .\n\u201c Stephanie was fired up and engaged , and that set the tone for everybody else , \u201d said David Di Martino , a longtime Democratic operative . \u201c She played a very important role in keeping the whole fight and the effort going and on message . \u201d\nCorralling Democrats , who usually aren \u2019 t known for their discipline in sticking to the party \u2019 s preferred message , and enforcing a consistent line of attack , can be a positive trait in a communications strategist , but the flip side is often failing to switch gears and react to developments or allow voices of dissent to be heard .\nIn a 2007 piece for Politico , Ms. Cutter outlined her \u201c new lessons for flacks \u201d as the parties were gearing up for the 2008 presidential battle .

Kerry \u2019 s losing presidential bid in 2004 .\nIn the end , the Kerry camp devolved , as so many failed campaigns do , into infighting and recriminations \u2014 and Ms. Cutter , with a reputation for being difficult and sometimes demeaning to reporters and colleagues alike , was the focus of a lot of the griping .\nIn the years since the Kerry campaign , her connections on Capitol Hill and in the Obama White House have helped revitalize her career and boost her reputation as one of Washington \u2019 s leading political players .\nShe served as a longtime adviser and spokeswoman for Kennedy , handing all of the communications strategy surrounding his battle with cancer and his work in the Senate .
