Last week , on one day alone , President Trump reversed himself on closing the Export-Import Bank , labeling China a \u201c currency manipulator , \u201d and canning Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve .\nThe \u201c globalists , \u201d including economic adviser Gary Cohn and son-in-law Jared Kushner , were ascendant ; Steve Bannon , chief policy strategist and keeper of the populist-nationalist flame , was on the outs . Or so it seemed .\n\u201c What happened to America First ? \u201d asked Pat Buchanan , a godfather of Trumpism , in a column .\nThis week , Trump swung back to the protectionist roots of his campaign . He signed an executive order dubbed \u201c Buy American , Hire American , \u201d aimed at reining in the H-1B visa program , which he says takes jobs from Americans and drives down wages . Then he signed an order calling on the Commerce Department to determine if steel imports threaten national security . While he was at it , he took a slap at Canada over dairy imports .\nSuddenly , Trump the populist is back . And Mr. Bannon clearly still has a seat at the table .\nBut taken together , the actions of Trump \u2019 s early presidency present a mixture of approaches that defy easy analysis . Campaigning with populist rhetoric is one thing , but governing as a populist presents a much bigger challenge , especially in the current US context , say experts on populism .\n\u201c Inevitably , you have to draw on people in the 'establishment ' to fill your government , which of course Trump has done , \u201d says Michael Kazin , a historian at Georgetown University and expert on social movements . \u201c And you \u2019 ve got to deal with the different branches of government . \u201d\nTo enact his agenda quickly , Trump would have needed large , supportive majorities in both houses of Congress and high approval ratings , and he hasn \u2019 t had those , Mr. Kazin adds .\nTrump has relied on executive action , foreign policy maneuvers , and the bully pulpit to create a sense of momentum . But that will take him only so far . Next week , the home stretch toward Day 100 of the Trump presidency , will present another big test . Congress returns Monday with just five days to pass legislation that keeps the government running beyond midnight on April 28 . And Trump is talking about trying again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 an effort that failed a month ago .\n`` We have a good chance of getting it soon , \u201d Trump said Thursday . \u201c I 'd like to say next week , but we will get it . ''\nDuring the campaign , dismantling Obamacare was high on Trump \u2019 s populist to-do list . On Inauguration Day , his first executive order targeted the health-care law , allowing federal agencies to dismantle regulations . It wasn \u2019 t a repeal \u2013 that must be done by Congress \u2013 but it signaled a concerted effort to weaken the law .\nNow Trump is back on the case . And he \u2019 s also still fighting against illegal immigration , against trade deals he sees as unfair , and for the US-Mexico border wall . Trump \u2019 s flip-flops have come more on international engagement \u2013 in his warm approach to China , his embrace of NATO , and his willingness to show US military muscle , particularly in his air strikes against the Syrian government and threats of action against North Korea .\nIn war , the saying goes , no battle plan survives contact with the enemy . And so it is with governing : There \u2019 s the roster of campaign promises , then there \u2019 s the reality of contact with Congress , where competing agendas \u2013 even from members of his own party \u2013 can make a president \u2019 s life miserable .\nAnd what does it even mean to be a populist , in general and in Trump \u2019 s case ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s a moving target , \u201d says Ken Collier , a political scientist at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches , Texas . \u201c The problem with the populist label is it gets used so broadly .
