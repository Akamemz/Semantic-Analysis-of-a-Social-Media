All of that has apparently neither caused nor been the result of big shifts in national public opinion on abortion.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nIt might have to do with another fact about public opinion on abortion \u2014 it's a topic for which the realities are anything but black and white, which is exactly how the arguments are all too often framed in the political arena.\n\nA majority of Americans support legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.
