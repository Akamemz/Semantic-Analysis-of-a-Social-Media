( Greg Nash/Pool via AP )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 Despite White House claims , the U.S. still lacks a comprehensive battle plan against the coronavirus in critical areas including masks , testing , treatments and vaccines , whistleblower Rick Bright warned Thursday in testimony before a House committee . \u201c Our window of opportunity is closing , \u201d he declared .\nThe nation could face \u201c the darkest winter in modern history \u201d if the virus rebounds , the government vaccine scientist told lawmakers . Bright \u2019 s appearance came after his ouster last month as head of a Health and Human Services biodefense agency , an action he alleges was retaliation by the Trump administration .\n\u201c We need still a comprehensive plan , and everyone across the government and everyone in America needs to know what that plan is , and what role they play , \u201d he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee . \u201c There are critical steps that we need to do to prepare ... we do not still have enough personal protective equipment to manage our health care workers ... we still do not have the supply chains ramped up for the drugs and vaccines , and we still don \u2019 t have plans in place for how we distribute those drugs and vaccines . We still do not have a comprehensive testing strategy . \u201d\nAt the White House , President Donald Trump said Bright looked like an \u201c angry , disgruntled employee , \u201d and Bright \u2019 s boss , HHS Secretary Alex Azar , said , \u201c Everything he is complaining about was achieved . \u201d\n\u201c So this is like somebody who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then , \u201d Azar added .\nTrump , said later , at a Pennsylvania medical equipment distributor , that the U.S. is ramping up production of COVID-19-related items and that his goal \u201c is to produce everything America needs for ourselves and then export to the world , including medicines . \u201d\nBright spoke in measured tones and rarely raised his voice during five hours of questioning . He didn \u2019 t question the fact that there \u2019 s now an all-out effort , financed by billions in taxpayer dollars , to procure masks and other supplies , develop better tests and treatments and discover an effective vaccine . His point was that those efforts aren \u2019 t being fitted together in a coherent strategy that will get supplies and medicines to where they \u2019 re most needed to protect people and prevent shortages and price gouging .\nAsked by Rep. Joe Kennedy , D-Mass. , if administration officials have prepared the country for the \u201c moment we are in \u201d and the months ahead , Bright responded , \u201c I think we have a lot of work to do to be prepared . \u201d\nRep. Frank Pallone , D-N.J. , asked if he should be concerned that Americans will have problems getting access to a vaccine when it \u2019 s available . Bright responded , \u201c Absolutely , sir . \u201d\nBright , a career official , alleges he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after repeatedly warning higher-ups the virus outbreak was going to be worse than the public was being led to believe .\nHe said the breaking point came when he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to hydroxychloroquine , a malaria drug Trump was touting as an effective treatment .\nThe FDA recently warned against its use for COVID-19 , except in limited circumstances . But at the White House on Thursday , the president was still bullish . \u201c We \u2019 ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy , \u201d Trump said . \u201c So , a lot of people have sworn by it , and we \u2019 ll see . \u201d\nRepublican lawmakers for the most part were careful not to attack Bright directly . But Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma criticized him for continuing to collect his $ 285,000 salary while first on sick leave for a spike in blood pressure , and now on vacation as he tries to straighten out his work situation .\n\u201c You \u2019 re too sick to go into work , but you \u2019 re well enough to come here while getting paid , \u201d said Mullin . \u201c I have a hard time understanding that . \u201d\nBright said one of the worst moments as he tried to raise alarms came when repeated efforts to jump-start U.S. production of respirator masks went nowhere .\nHe recalled getting emails in late January from Mike Bowen , an executive at a medical supply company called Prestige Ameritech , indicating that its N95 mask supply was \u201c completely decimated . \u201d\n\u201c And he said : \u2018 We \u2019 re in deep shit .
