This is a candidate who has advocated a clearly defined war crime ( killing relatives of suspected terrorists ) , showed reckless disregard for lessons of history ( citing the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II as a precedent , rather than an abject injustice ) and scoffed at the Constitution in talking about blocking Muslims from entering the U.S. , denying citizenship to immigrant children born on U.S. soil , and \u2018 opening up \u2019 libel laws to allow politicians to sue their critics. \u201d Oct. 17 , 2017 : \u201c President Trump \u2019 s expressed contempt for a free press seems right out of an authoritarian playbook , where delegitimizing and ultimately silencing government watchdogs and critical commentators is a cornerstone of retaining power . \u2018 It is frankly disgusting that the press is able to write whatever it wants to write , \u2019 he said Wednesday .
