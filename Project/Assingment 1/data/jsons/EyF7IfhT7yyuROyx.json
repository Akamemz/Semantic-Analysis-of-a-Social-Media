Not from my end , but theirs . They quickly turn emotional , taking everything personally . In the end , I \u2019 m left wondering why I engaged , but more importantly , I \u2019 m left wonder where they got their information from . It \u2019 s just as President Ronald Reagan famously said , \u201c The trouble with our liberal friends is not that they \u2019 re ignorant , it \u2019 s that they know so much that isn \u2019 t so . \u201d\nIn Reagan \u2019 s time , liberals got their crazier information from the \u201c rumor mill. \u201d As weird as it is for anyone who grew up in the Internet age , the \u201c rumor mill \u201d existed . It was quite efficient in a time when phones were tethered to walls and were only used for actually talking to people .\nFalse information managed to circumnavigate the globe at a time when it had to travel from person to person verbally . Ask anyone over 35 , no matter where they grew up , if they \u2019 d heard the story about Rod Stewart needing his stomach pumped or about Richard Gere \u2019 s trip to the emergency room . I won \u2019 t give you any more details than that , but if you grew up before the Internet was invented you \u2019 ve heard the stories .\nFrom Maine to California , those and other lies managed to spread everywhere .
