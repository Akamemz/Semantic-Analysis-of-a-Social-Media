    "content": "Increasing the minimum wage is a popular idea . It 's also a good , if suboptimal , way to help low-wage workers , address inequality , and reduce poverty . It 's also a policy that distributes a significant amount of money down the income scale using an entirely off-budget mechanism , which means the government is n't creating a politically vulnerable welfare program and is n't financing that welfare program with new debt or by taxing outraged rich people .\nThis makes it an attractive option for liberal elites and lawmakers , too . And at a time when conservatives are n't willing to entertain more income support or another payroll tax cut , without simultaneously taking it out of the hide of the poor in some other way , the minimum wage is the natural , last-best way for liberals to fight on their behalf . It 's just about the last arrow left in their quiver .\nWith all that to speak for it , it 's no surprise that conservatives hate the minimum wage , certainly do n't want to increase the minimum wage , and are desperate for independent confirmation of their claim that a $ 10.10 minimum wage , as President Obama has proposed , is a job killer .\nThey got their wish on Wednesday , when the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis concluding that a phased-in $ 10.10 minimum wage would have a modest but real disemployment effect . They projected that at $ 10.10 , the minimum wage would reduce employment somewhere between a trivial amount and 1 million jobs by the end of 2016 . Their best estimate within that range is that a $ 10.10 minimum wage would cost the economy 500,000 jobs relative to what would happen without any increase at all .\nConservatives , who would oppose a minimum wage increase of any size even if the impact on employment amounted to the loss of a single job , were ecstatic . The minimum wage is too popular to oppose with ideology alone . The only way to oppose a policy that 's popular among wage earners , and speaks to a widely shared moral sense that full-time workers should n't live in poverty , is to make supporters worry that their jobs might be on the line .\nIt 's a tough finding for Democrats to spin away , in part because the finding itself is large enough to command attention without being large enough to invite a ton of second guessing .

Those are both pretty easy tasks .\nLet 's start with this wise tweet from economist Austin Frakt :\nIf increasing the minimum wage entailed literally no downside , there 'd be no reason not to set it at infinity-jillion dollars .

If a conservative Republican introduced a bill to reduce the minimum wage by as much as Obama wants to increase it , and CBO found that it would thrust a million people into poverty , reduce wages for 15 million more , but created 500,000 jobs , I do n't think that bill would garner much support , no matter how widely its supporters touted it as a `` job creator .

People who earn higher wages are less likely to quit their jobs . Likewise , when people 's wages increase they slide up the ACA 's means-tested benefit scale .

In states that have refused to expand Medicaid , a higher minimum wage would pull people out of the coverage gap and make them eligible for tax credits on the exchanges . This would come at a cost to the federal government , but would diminish one of the most inhumane unintended consequence of the GOP 's ACA sabotage campaign , and a big political liability for Republican governors .\nNobody on the left disputes that it 's possible to increase the minimum wage beyond the point at which the costs outstrip the benefits .
