Today 's key race features the senate minority leader pummeling a tea party challenger in Kentucky , setting up perhaps the marquee matchup of 2014 . A pediatric neurosurgeon is trying to get the GOP nomination in Oregon after a weekend of stories about her personal life . Children and grandchildren of politicians are trying to send another generation to elected office . And a Clinton in-law is eager to get her old House seat back . That 's just a taste of the variety of choices voters have in the six states voting today .\nGet real-time election results and news about all the races you care about delivered right to your phone from now until November .

Download \u2588\u2588\u2588 for iPhone here or \u2588\u2588\u2588 for Android here .\nHere 's the top primary races being held today and nine reasons why they matter :\nTHE START OF A REAL BLUEGRASS BRAWL : The Kentucky GOP Senate primary is tonight 's marquee race although polls show Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell beating his tea party challenger Matt Bevin by a wide margin . The most recent survey , an NBC News/Marist poll from earlier this month had McConnell leading by 32 points . And how big ( or small ) the margin is will be important to look at as well . WHY IT MATTERS : McConnell was the number one target for the tea party , but it looks like they have fell short-well short-in this fight . The race was supposed to be a closer battle coming into primary season with McConnell 's unpopularity and Bevin 's significant personal finances , but Bevin was a flawed candidate that made serious campaign trail errors and with no political experience was just not up to the challenge . Bevin did have money and national political groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Madison Project backing his candidacy , but it did n't matter as the campaign mistakes and other errors proved too much to topple a giant . This race is still important because as soon as it is over it marks the official start to the general election in the Bluegrass State . McConnell vs. his Democratic opponent , Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes will be the most closely watched race this cycle . In that same NBC News/Marist poll the McConnell vs. Grimes face off shows the 35-year-old ahead of the congressional leader by 9 points . The race could determine control of the Senate and will be a closely watched brawl to the very end .\nA SEVEN-WAY BATTLE IN GEORGIA : Tonight , seven Republicans will vie to oppose Democrat Michelle Nunn , who could be a bright spot for Democrats this cycle . The top contenders are David Perdue , the cousin of former Gov . Sonny Perdue and the former CEO of Dollar General ; Karen Handel , the former Georgia secretary of state who 's backed by conservatives including Sarah Palin , Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer , and blogger/commentator Erick Erickson ; and U.S. Reps. Jack Kingston , Phil Gingrey , and Paul Broun . With none of them likely to gather over 50 percent of the vote Tuesday night , the GOP primary will almost certainly head to a July 22 runoff . Polls have shown Perdue leading , with Kingston and Handel as the other top contenders . WHY IT MATTERS : Nunn , the former CEO of the George H.W . Bush-founded Points of Light Foundation and the daughter of former Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn , is a strong candidate for Democrats in an unexpected state , and Georgia could be an oasis for the party in an otherwise barren 2014 Senate landscape . Despite Georgia 's deep red leanings in recent years , polls have shown her narrowly beating the Republicans in the field . Perdue brings the most significant outside money behind him , while Handel , with her endorsements , brings tea party bona fides . Whoever advances tonight , a competitive general-election lies ahead .\nPOLITICAL OFFSPRING TAKE A BITE OUT OF THE PEACHTREE STATE : For Democrats in Georgia , 2014 is all about turning back the clock . Former U.S. president and Georgia governor Jimmy Carter 's grandson state Sen. Jason Carter is running to follow in his grandfather 's footsteps , challenging sitting Republican Gov . Nathan Deal . Michelle Nunn is running to fill her father 's shoes , hoping to replace retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss . Perhaps surprisingly given Georgia 's strongly Republican voting patterns in recent years , both of them are competitive : Multiple polls show Nunn leading her GOP opponents , and two major surveys this month from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and NBC News/Marist have shown Carter trailing by four and 10 percentage points , respectively . Tonight , Nunn will almost certainly advance , and Carter certainly will : He 's the only qualified Democratic candidate for governor . WHY THEY MATTER : Democrats have talked about a Southern resurgence in the Obama era , and while they 've made gains in Virginia and North Carolina , Republicans have maintained a stronghold in the conservative Deep South . Georgia had a Democratic senator and a Democratic governor as recently as 2003 , when Roy Barnes governed the state and Max Cleland represented it in the Senate . Nunn and Carter are running competitive campaigns now , but they 'll have to navigate issues of health care , gun control , and President Obama 's unpopularity if they 're to pull off the unexpected and turn a Deep-South state blue in 2014 .\nRAGE AGAINST THE ( CLINTON ) MACHINE IN PENNSYLVANIA : What should have been a virtual lockdown in the thirteenth congressional district Democratic primary for former Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies , who just happens to be Chelsea Clinton 's mother-in-law , has become a competitive four-way race as Rep. Allyson Schwartz leaves her seat to run for governor . Margolies , who has struggled to connect with voters , faces strong competition from opponent Brendan Boyle , a state legislator whose campaign focuses on the middle class . The brash yet highly popular State Senator Daylin Leach is also a force to contend with , and Valerie Arkoosh , a practicing obstetric anesthesiologist who spent time working on Obamacare policy , has built her campaign on the success of the healthcare bill . WHY IT MATTERS : This primary race has been called a `` fight for the soul of the Democratic party . '' Why has the highly-connected Margolies , who has had both Bill and Hillary Clinton join the campaign trail-as well as a last minute robo-call from the former president-not been a consistent front-runner ? It may come down to two ads in the district , which really show the differences between Margolies and Boyle . One , for Margolies , features Bill Clinton speaking about his longtime ally . Boyle 's ad shows the image of a man - the candidate 's Irish immigrant father - sweeping the platform at a Philadelphia train station , and tells his `` American Dream '' story . A win for Boyle , who has raised the least money of the four candidates but boasts a strong grassroots operation , could possibly set the tone for 2016 . Boyle , 37 , is the youngest candidate in the race by 15 years , and Margolies , at 71 , is doing well with older voters who remember her time in the House in the early 1990s . Will the Clintons have coattails ?\nRACE TO REPLACE THE COUNTRY 'S MOST VULNERABLE GOV : The Democratic primary to try and replace the most vulnerable governor in the country , Pennsylvania 's Tom Corbett has been a four-way fight , but now it looks like this is businessman Tom Wolf 's to lose . Wolf is up against Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz who started this race with the momentum . Besides Wolf and Schwartz , State Treasurer Rob McCord and Katie McGinty , an environmental adviser during the Clinton administration are on the ballot . WHY IT MATTERS : Wolf is leading in state polls , although he was practically unknown when the race started . He heads one of the country 's largest manufacturers of kitchen and bathroom cabinets and has poured most of the over $ 14 million he has raised into television advertising trying to introduce himself to Keystone state voters and bring up his name recognition . Corbett has already been focusing his fire on Wolf while Wolf 's Democratic opponents have attacked him for how much money he has spent and Schwartz , who ran embracing Obamacare , has hit Wolf for lack of political experience .\nWILL A STRANGE TALE IN OREGON CHANGE GOP FATE ? : It has been quite a few days in the GOP primary race in Oregon . Revelations came to light over the weekend that an ex-boyfriend of Dr. Monica Wehby -a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon who was the first woman to graduate from UCLA 's neurosurgery program-called the police last April and claimed she was `` stalking him , '' although he helped fund a super PAC attacking her opponent , state representative Jason Conger . Andrew Miller , a lumber executive , says he still backs Wehby and he `` regrets '' ever getting the police involved . Before the news surfaced , first reported by Politico , Wehby seemed poised for victory . But , just the night before the primary The Oregonian reported on the existence of a 2007 police report , which details Wehby 's ex-husband 's allegations of harassment while they were going through a divorce . Wehby 's now ex-husband , Jim Grant , also called 9-11 after this altercation with her . Also Monday night , KGW , the NBC affiliate in Portland , revealed another police report Grant filed in 2009 . This time over a custody issue . WHY IT MATTERS : These are strange tales , but as Oregon is a vote by mail state it may not have any impact on the primary , although in the last election 55 percent of voters did drop off their ballot in person on election day . If Wehby wins tonight it 's likely all three of these incidents will be used against her in the general election against incumbent Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley . In a Friday debate , Conger said the situation raised questions about her judgment that could be used against her in the general election match up . Wehby is considered a rising star in her party and said in a statement the initial police report and 911 call being released is the `` cost of challenging the political status quo . '' Wehby blames the revelations on politics , noting in a statement she is `` deeply saddened that such a personal matter , which bears no relevance to my Senate campaign , has been used as a political weapon to attack my character . '' Wehby 's candidacy has buoyed Republicans who now see Oregon as a possible pick up in their race to gain control of the Senate . She 's been backed by Republicans including Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , and Dr. Ben Carson , and has campaigned heavily against Obamacare . Conger is seen as the more socially conservative choice and has been backed by Oregon Right to Life and Rick Santorum . Oregon has not elected a Republican in a statewide election since 2002 , but because of Merkley 's support of the Affordable Care Act in a state that had an especially disastrous roll-out of its state health care exchange , which ultimately failed , he is seen as vulnerable .\nAN ESTABLISHMENT VS . TEA PARTY BRAWL , THIS ONE FEATURING MITT ROMNEY : Attorney Bryan Smith , backed by the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks , is trying to topple incumbent Rep. Mike Simpson in the Idaho second congressional district GOP primary . Simpson is backed by the business community , including the Chamber of Commerce . The Chamber has run ads , over $ 2 million worth , on his behalf including one featuring Mitt Romney . WHY IT MATTERS : Looking into the camera Romney says Simpson deserves support because `` the stakes are very high in this election because Washington spending is out of control , '' stressing he has `` seen him in action . '' This was another tea party vs. establishment fight and although polling is scarce , Club for Growth stopped airing ads in this race last month signaling this may no longer be as competitive as it once looked .\nTHE ARKANSAS FACE-OFF IN A BATTLE FOR THE SENATE : Sen. Mark Pryor , D-Ark. , and Rep. Tom Cotton , R-Ark. , are expected to secure their respective party 's nominations in the Arkansas Senate primary Tuesday night . The Pryor family name runs deep in Arkansas as Pryor 's father held the same Senate seat his son is fighting for and served as the state 's governor . Pryor 's father also forged a strong alliance with the Clinton family which could help boost Pryor in the general election . Cotton , a first-term Congressman who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , is a conservative rising star and is seen by Republicans as one of their top chances to topple Democrats this year . WHY IT MATTERS : There wo n't be any surprises when it comes to the Arkansas Senate primary . Pryor and Cotton have a distinct advantage compared to other midterm campaigns this year - neither candidate is facing a tough primary race . Pryor enjoys an unchallenged race as the Democratic incumbent while Cotton had establishment Republicans and tea partiers rally around him early on . This has allowed Pryor and Cotton to stay focused on the general election instead of worrying about contentious primary challenges . Republicans are hoping to pick up a Senate seat in this red state , but recent polls show Pryor ahead less than six months from election day . An NBC News/Marist poll released earlier this month had Pryor up eleven points over Cotton .\nA COWBOY , A CURMUDGEON , A BIKER , AND A NORMAL GUY WALK INTO AN IDAHO VOTING BOOTH : It was n't just that brave cat who took on a dog to save a little boy that lit up the Internet last week . The strangest debate of all time also became a viral sensation . Idaho Gov . Butch Otter has a real primary challenge from state . Sen. Russ Fulcher , but in order to debate Otter said all of his challengers must be on stage . So they were joined by Walt Bayes and perennial candidate Harley Brown . Brown , wearing biker gear including leather gloves , defended his tendency to offend with racist jokes saying he is waging war against political correctness : `` I 'm about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in a punchbowl and I 'm proud of it , '' he said when asked about jokes on his campaign website targeted at African-Americans , Asians , Hispanics , women , Jews , and almost every other possible religion or ethnicity . Bayes , sporting his long white beard , spent most of the debate railing against abortion . Brown may have put it best when he said , `` Folks , you have a choice : A cowboy , a curmudgeon , a biker or a normal guy . Take your pick . '' Not to be lost in all this is a real race between Otter and Fulcher and another establishment vs. tea party primary . There 's been scarce polling , but Fulcher has tried to paint Otter as not conservative enough . It 's a race Otter told the Spokesman-Review he never saw coming : `` Did I ever believe in my life somebody would run at me from the right ? No , I did n't . ''",

Take your pick.\" Not to be lost in all this is a real race between Otter and Fulcher and another establishment vs. tea party primary. There's been scarce polling, but Fulcher has tried to paint Otter as not conservative enough. It's a race Otter told the Spokesman-Review he never saw coming: \"Did I ever believe in my life somebody would run at me from the right? No, I didn't.\"",
