Circuit Court of Appeals has long been one of the most conservative appellate courts . It upheld the Texas law later struck down in Whole Woman \u2019 s Health . The Supreme Court justices ruled that the law had \u201c no ... health related benefits \u201d and would shutter half of the abortion clinics in the state .\nFederal district Judge John deGravelles followed that ruling when , in 2016 , he blocked Act 620 , the Louisiana law , from going into effect . The law , he found , would leave \u201c one provider and one clinic \u201d in the whole state . ( The Monitor visited one of the clinics last year . )\nA three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit reversed that ruling , writing that Act 620 was \u201c remarkably different \u201d from the Texas case .

Specifically , the justices are supposed to consider four factors : the quality of the past decision \u2019 s reasoning , its consistency with related decisions , legal developments since the past decision , and reliance on the decision throughout the legal system and society .\n\u201c In the abortion area [ stare decisis ] is a little bit for up for grabs , \u201d says Gillian Metzger , a professor at Columbia Law School , since the right to an abortion has been contested for decades \u2013 from before the Supreme Court declared it constitutional in Roe v. Wade in 1973 .\n\u201c But I don \u2019 t think Whole Woman \u2019 s Health marked a significant departure from \u201d past abortion precedent , adds Professor Metzger , who co-authored an amicus brief in support of the groups challenging Act 620 .\nThe older a precedent , the more courts and society have come to rely on it , stare decisis doctrine holds . In that sense , it could be less damaging to adjust or overturn a relatively new precedent .\nOn the other hand , \u201c with a three year-old or four year-old precedent , you \u2019 re almost never going to have a different circumstance that would warrant overturning it , \u201d says Professor Williams .\nThat may not be the case with another precedent Wednesday \u2019 s case is raising , however .\nInstead of narrowing , or overruling , Whole Woman \u2019 s Health , the justices could focus on a second question raised in a cross-petition from the state of Louisiana : whether abortion providers have \u201c third-party standing \u201d to challenge regulations on behalf of patients .\nJustice Clarence Thomas , one of the court \u2019 s most conservative members , has often criticized allowing abortion providers to use it , and Justice Samuel Alito expressed similar thoughts during today \u2019 s argument .\n\u201c The constitutional right at issue is not a constitutional right of abortion clinics , is it ? It \u2019 s the right of women , \u201d he said . \u201c Can there be third-party standing if there is no hindrance whatsoever to the bringing of suit by people whose rights are at stake ? \u201d\nThe Supreme Court has applied third-party standing in abortion and other medical contexts for almost 50 years .\nIf abortions clinics are blocked from challenging abortion regulations , only women seeking an abortion would be able to . With the stigma associated with abortion cases , combined with the fact that litigation usually lasts longer than the time period in which a woman could get an abortion , those plaintiffs would likely be difficult to find , says Melissa Murray , a professor at New York University School of Law .\n\u201c A lot of people probably wouldn \u2019 t understand what it means for doctors to lack standing , \u201d she continues , \u201c but lawyers in this field would know immediately that [ it ] would make it much harder to bring these challenges . \u201d\nIt may be that the Supreme Court would have preferred to not hear this case at all \u2013 or at least not for a few years . The 5th Circuit had other ideas .\n\u201c By not adhering to pretty clear precedent [ the 5th Circuit ] put the Supreme Court in a position where it had to take this case , even if it would have preferred to wait and see how the law develops , \u201d says Professor Metzger .\nAnd if the justices uphold the 5th Circuit \u2019 s ruling , she adds , \u201c it really is inciting other lower courts who are so inclined to take similar steps and really push issues onto the Supreme Court \u2019 s agenda . \u201d\nAbortion has for decades been an emotional , polarizing issue . That political heat has intensified in recent years with candidate Donald Trump pledging to nominate justices who would \u201c automatically \u201d overturn Roe .\nHis two appointees to the high court \u2013 Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 both described Roe v. Wade as settled precedent during their confirmation hearings . Both were also relatively quiet during today \u2019 s argument ( Justice Gorsuch didn \u2019 t ask a single question ) .\nBut \u201c if the court is seen as hollowing out Whole Woman \u2019 s Health only four years [ later ] , there \u2019 s going to be a lot of people ... who will see this as a political decision , \u201d says Professor Murray .\n\u201c That \u2019 s something Chief Justice Roberts , who has been a steward of court \u2019 s institutional integrity , is thinking about , or should be thinking about , \u201d she adds .",
