He does n't show up very often , does n't do much campaigning when he is around , and does n't seem to be building very impressive field operations .\nAnd it 's raising eyebrows . James Pindell of the Boston Globe wrote last week that Rubio 's New Hampshire surge was `` riddled with doubts , '' and that GOP insiders are bemoaning his `` lack of staff '' and `` activity . '' National Review 's Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson reported Wednesday that Rubio 's `` weak ground game '' was angering Iowa Republicans . And the New Hampshire Union Leader wrote an editorial headlined , `` Marco ? Marco ? Where 's Rubio ? ''\nFor a candidate who 's so often deemed `` The Republican Barack Obama , '' it sure seems like Rubio has missed some key lessons from the president 's historic 2008 campaign . And this is n't good optics for a candidate who 's already been criticized ( somewhat unfairly ) for missing lots of Senate votes , either .\nRubio seems uninterested in campaigning hard or building a ground operation in Iowa and New Hampshire\nThe conventional wisdom is that a candidate needs to win either Iowa or New Hampshire to win the nomination . In fact , every nominee for decades has done that , except for Bill Clinton in 1992 ( an odd year in which the Iowa caucuses effectively `` did n't count '' because Iowan Tom Harkin was running ) . Candidates who 've tried to `` skip '' both early states in hopes that a later win will propel then to prominence have failed miserably .\nFurthermore , said conventional wisdom continues , the way to win in both Iowa and New Hampshire is to work hard on the ground . The candidate should spend a lot of time there . The campaign should build up a network of local relationships , winning over supporters one by one .
