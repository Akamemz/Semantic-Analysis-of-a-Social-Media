    "content": "For now , the 1997 land mine treaty that prohibits use and development is \u201c surviving and thriving , \u201d says Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch . \u201c 164 countries are signatories , and there have been more every year since the treaty was created . They \u2019 re not going to tolerate any land mine use , and we \u2019 re not going to stop the monitoring that we do . \u201d\nHuman rights groups and some former military officers are among those who are not as convinced that land mines are necessary to bolster American defense . As recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , with 78 % of victims being civilians .\nIn late January , the Trump administration rescinded a U.S. prohibition against anti-personnel mines , citing their power as a deterrent . In addition , the Pentagon can now \u201c turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable , \u201d said acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Victorino Mercado .\nWith an estimated failure rate of 6 in 1 million , \u201c smart \u201d land mines are supposed to deactivate after a period of time . It \u2019 s a safety feature that the U.S. Defense Department highlights as one reason land mines should be back on the table .\nAfter being banned from planting land mines since 2014 , the United States military can now use them once again , and Victorino Mercado admits it \u2019 s \u201c a very emotional subject \u201d \u2013 including within the halls of the Pentagon .\nThat said , \u201c we \u2019 re not talking about what you see on TV , \u201d added Mr. Mercado , the acting assistant secretary of defense for strategy , plans , and capabilities , during a Pentagon briefing last month . The prohibitions against the old tripwire and pressure-plate land mines that have \u201c really wreaked havoc \u201d remain in place , and any newly deployed land mines must have safeguards to protect civilians . \u201c If we were n't comfortable ... that we can mitigate the risk to our forces and ensure that we minimize civilian casualties , then we would n't probably put this policy in place . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s that \u201c probably \u201d that has prompted unease among some former U.S. military generals and an outcry from human rights groups . Their concerns hinge in part on just how effective the \u201c safety valves \u201d for modern land mines are . Even granting technological advances , opponents argue that they don \u2019 t justify bringing back weapons of war that nonetheless remain indiscriminate .\nAs recently as 2016 , an average of 23 people were killed or injured every day by land mines , according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines , which notes that the vast majority of victims \u2013 78 % \u2013 are civilians .\nThe Obama administration decided that while it wouldn \u2019 t sign the 1997 international treaty banning anti-personnel land mines \u2013 known as the Ottawa Convention \u2013 it would abide by its requirements , except on the Korean Peninsula . Commanders there lobbied to retain the capability to counter the threat of hundreds of thousands of North Korean troops and armored trucks ready to pour over the border .\nThe White House statement rescinding the ban authorizes four-star military commanders \u201c in exceptional circumstances \u201d \u2013 and with the express approval of the secretary of defense , according to Mr. Mercado \u2013 \u201c to employ advanced , non-persistent landmines specifically designed to reduce unintended harm to civilians . \u201d\nModern land mine designs include a deactivation mechanism , which is supposed to kick in after a period of time , between , say , 12 hours and 60 days . The minefields are also \u201c smart , \u201d in that they can \u201c talk to each other and be command-activated , and link into other sensors so that they know when enemy formations are coming , \u201d says retired Col. Mark Cancian , senior adviser in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , who previously worked on land mine issues at the Pentagon .\nBut reducing the threat does not mean eliminating it , notes a U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines statement released last week by 63 nongovernmental organizations that came together to condemn the policy . \u201c If the self-destruct or self-deactivation mechanisms were to fail , they would remain lethal , and the potential exists for the components to be repurposed into improvised explosive devices , \u201d it says . \u201c While there are still too many casualties annually , we have seen a dramatic decline since the Treaty came into being . To roll back the progress the global community has made would not only be a tragedy but an affront to the dignity of landmine survivors . \u201d\nMr. Cancian argues that cameras and infrared heat signature sensors can help to bring real-time surveillance of minefields . And more generally , he places a high degree of trust in the technology . \u201c I have a great deal of confidence that they \u2019 ll do what they say they will , \u201d he says . Pentagon officials say the odds that the mines will fail to self-deactivate as they \u2019 ve been programmed to do is 6 in 1 million .\n\u201c That \u2019 s pretty good . Can we make it better ? We can make it better. \u201d said Mr. Mercado , who added that besides the land mines that it already has stockpiled \u2013 most of which will expire in 2030 \u2013 the Pentagon can now \u201c turn to our industries to start developing land mines that are even more reliable . \u201d\nThis acknowledgment of room for improvement , however , points to the underlying threat that even the most recent land mine technology poses to civilians , says Mary Wareham , advocacy director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch . \u201c I \u2019 ve heard land mines called everything from \u2018 safe \u2019 to \u2018 pure \u2019 to \u2018 area denial systems. \u2019 There \u2019 s definitely been efforts by the defense sector to make more precise and accurate weapons . We \u2019 ve seen that with the more sophisticated cluster weapons that do not leave many unexploded remnants \u2013 but they still leave some . \u201d\nEven when the U.S. military \u201c is out there laying down so-called \u2018 nonpersistent smart mines \u2019 that will time out after 30 days , there \u2019 s still a field of mines out there , \u201d adds Stephen Pomper , senior director for policy at the International Crisis Group . \u201c Are U.S. troops going to be comfortable walking through there ? Are people going to send their children to play in them ? \u201d\nThe Trump administration argues that the greater risk is to U.S. national security . \u201c [ R ] estrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration \u2019 s policy could place [ U.S. forces ] at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries , \u201d according to the White House statement . \u201c The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops . \u201d\nAnalysts point out , however , that U.S. military leaders outside the Korean Peninsula haven \u2019 t been clamoring for land mines . Rather than in their underuse , the danger lies in their overuse , retired Gen. Carter Ham , former head of U.S. Africa Command , tells the Monitor . \u201c I think what we need to do is be very , very careful in the application of land mines . It \u2019 s kind of like nuclear weapons \u2013 we should never take anything off the table , but we should make sure we have very tight controls . \u201d\nThe current argument for land mines lies chiefly in their deterrent value \u2013 sowing uncertainty is a useful war tactic . They \u201c cause the adversary to have to pause and say , \u2018 Do I need to clear this field or not ? \u2019 \u201d Mr. Mercado said . This is particularly true , some analysts argue , against the backdrop of the Trump administration \u2019 s National Defense Strategy , which cites U.S. jockeying with \u201c great powers \u201d like China and Russia \u2013 neither of whom are Ottawa Convention signatories \u2013 as a bigger threat than terrorism .\nIn the event that Moscow decides to invade a neighbor , for example , \u201c a [ land mine ] capability like this would be very helpful to slow Russians until we bring in NATO , \u201d Mr. Cancian says . Yet in an era of drones , cyberwarfare , and hypersonic weapons , \u201c I guess I \u2019 m a little bit skeptical that if , God forbid , the U.S. were to end up in a ground war with Russia , \u201d Mr. Pomper adds , \u201c that the outcome would be determined by the availability of anti-personnel land mines . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
