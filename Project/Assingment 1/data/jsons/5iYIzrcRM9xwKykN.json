He talks to Steve Inskeep about the topics those bots focus on.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nRussian bots apparently have opinions on the Parkland school shooting. By bots, we mean automated social media accounts linked to Russia, which federal investigators say were used to play up American divisions and promote President Trump's election in 2016. Now it seems that some bots weighed in on the divisive subject of mass shootings and gun control in the last few days. Bret Schafer is here in our studio. He tracks Russian disinformation at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which was set up after the 2016 election.\n\nWelcome to the program, sir.\n\nBRET SCHAFER: Thank you. Good to be here.\n\nINSKEEP: What are the Russians saying so far as you can tell?\n\nSCHAFER: So we saw the same kind of activity after the Vegas shooting, actually. So it started with just conversations that Americans were having. So it was breaking news. That quickly shifted to the gun control debate that took sort of extreme positions on both sides.
