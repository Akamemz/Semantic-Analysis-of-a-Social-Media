What he does not want is any repeat of the demonstrations in the heart of Moscow , with tens of thousands of protesters challenging his landslide victory and effective coronation as unchallenged leader of Russia . Indeed , one key motive behind his embrace of Trump , as Friday 's US intelligence report observed , was his belief that Hillary Clinton was responsible for `` inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and 2012 .

Those elections could bring to power leaders substantially more friendly , even subservient , to the Kremlin -- especially if Russia is able to put its thumb on the scales in many such contests through the very kind of cyber-influence it exerted on the US election .\nIndeed , the US intelligence report suggested that `` Moscow will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide , including against US allies .

Putin is in desperate need of an economy that will work for all his people -- particularly a guaranteed revenue stream that can cement the loyalty of his various supporters .\nUntil global oil prices collapsed in 2008 from more than $ 140 a barrel to less than $ 40 , the Russian economy was riding high . The oligarchs who served as Putin 's most sturdy and loyal bedrock of support were able to pocket billions . And the vast mass of voters found themselves with a more vibrant consumer economy than they , their parents or grandparents could ever have imagined .\nSince then , it 's been tough sledding . Russia has no viable revenue source other than oil . When Putin last stood for reelection , in 2012 , oil prices had recovered to just above $ 100 a barrel , but today they again hover at barely half that level .\nAn OPEC agreement that Russia has reluctantly joined aims to boost these prices . But if a Trump administration should choose to open the spigots of American oil production , putting further pressure on prices , that could explode this pipe dream . Indeed , the Kremlin-backed TV network RT broadcast anti-fracking programs , which , according to the US intelligence report , provides an indication of how much the Kremlin wants to curb American oil output .\nStill , there is more to Putin 's dream than simply assuring his electoral prospects . It 's becoming quite clear that Putin 's ultimate aim is restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed during the peak years of the Soviet period -- an equal competitor with the United States .\nWhat this means is that Russia must show itself to be a central player in sensitive global regions from the Middle East to the Caucasus and the Baltics . Already , Putin has been adept in easing the United States out of the Middle East and establishing himself as a peacemaker in Syria , an effective foe of ISIS and an ally of Turkey -- still a member of NATO -- which has emerged as a central , if metastable , force in both these conflicts .\nPutin 's goal has been , and may continue to be , keeping the United States on the outside , its nose pressed against the glass . But an adroit President Trump can make good use of his understanding of Putin 's ultimate desires to force his way back into areas where America has been marginalized .\nIndeed , the United States must find a way back into its lost role , especially if it is to be of any help in supporting Israel as its only real friend in the region . It can hardly do that from the sidelines , where Turkey and Russia have relegated the United States to in recent months .\nAt the same time , America needs Russia at least acquiescent if it is going to face down China economically or militarily , as Trump has suggested he is inclined to do ; enforce restraints on Iran 's nuclear program ; maintain the continued draw-down of both American and Russian nuclear arms ; and hold North Korea and its missiles at bay . A Russian veto in the United Nations Security Council could be a decisive weapon .\nUnder communism , the Soviet Union held onto most of its friends by force or threat of arms .
