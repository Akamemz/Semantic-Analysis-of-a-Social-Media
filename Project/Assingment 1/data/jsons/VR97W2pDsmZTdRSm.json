REUTERS/Paul Ratje\n\nThe executive order included a number of exemptions and was not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.\n\nHere is what Trump\u2019s order does and does not do.\n\nWHO WILL BE AFFECTED?\n\nThe order blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the United States by obtaining what is informally known as a \u201cgreen card.\u201d\n\nThe measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.\n\nThe order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas.\n\nForeigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.\n\nThe vast majority of employment-based green cards are granted to people inside the United States, and thereby not covered by the ban. Most family-based green cards are granted to people outside the country, however.\n\nThe immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services.\n\nWHO IS EXEMPT?\n\nDoctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform \u201cessential\u201d work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.\n\nThe measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence.\n\nThe order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21.\n\nThe measure contains several other exemptions, including a general exemption for \u201cany alien whose entry would be in the national interest.\u201d\n\nHOW LONG WILL THE SUSPENSION LAST?\n\nThe suspension will begin just before midnight on Thursday and last 60 days. After that, Trump will review U.S. economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS?\n\nThe executive order states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs - including guest worker programs - to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.\n\nA senior administration official told Reuters this week that the White House was considering a separate action that could deal with skilled workers who enter the country on H-1B visas and others affected by U.S. immigration policy.\n\nDOES TRUMP HAVE THE POWER TO SUSPEND IMMIGRATION?\n\nTrump\u2019s latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nFederal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January.\n\nSome legal experts argue the high court\u2019s ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump\u2019s latest order to be challenged in court.\n\nWHAT DOES IMMIGRATION LOOK LIKE NOW?\n\nThe United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration.\n\nIn addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.\n\nAmid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday.\n\nThe number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third.\n\nWOULD BLOCKING IMMIGRANTS HELP THE ECONOMY?\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHowever, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\u201cThe idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,\u201d he said.",
