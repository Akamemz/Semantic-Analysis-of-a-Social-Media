    "title": "Katie Pavlich - Democrat Controlled Senate Votes to Repeal ObamaCare Medical Device Tax",

    "content": "Apparently , the Senate thinks the medical device tax in ObamaCare is a pretty bad idea and voted to repeal it last night .\nThe Senate overwhelmingly passed a largely symbolic resolution calling for repeal of a 2.3 percent tax on medical device companies on Thursday , as more than 30 Democrats joined Republicans in approving it .\nThe tax helps to fund President Barack Obama 's 2010 healthcare law . It applies to a range of medical products - from bedpans to expensive heart devices - many manufactured in the home states of the senators backing the repeal .\nThe Senate voted 79-20 to call for repeal of the tax , but the resolution is non-binding and will not change the levy . The symbolic measure will be attached to a non-binding budget measure drafted by Senate Democrats that is expected to pass on Friday .\nFull repeal of the tax may be difficult to achieve , given its $ 30 billion price tag and the opposition of key Senate Democrats , including Majority Leader Harry Reid .\nAs a reminder of just how bad the medical device tax is , it 's pretty much a tax within a tax that will not only kill jobs in the medical device industry , but will kill medical device innovation as well .\nNot only does this tax increase costs on companies , it also increases costs on hospitals , doctors and people in need of medical treatment that requires medical devices to be used . As a consequence of this , biomedical or medical device engineering firms are already laying off workers who develop crucial medical products due to the `` unforeseen '' costs , or in other words , the costs of ObamaCare . Not to mention , the more money these companies pay to the government , the less money they have to invest in research and development .\nWith this new medical device tax , students who pay large sums of money to get degrees in the field of biomedical engineering , just like doctors , will no longer see the benefits of going into the field and therefore , we will have a shortage of engineers developing new medical device technology . The medical device tax is a death sentence for American medical innovation .\nAnd where exactly does this tax hurt the most ? When it comes to research and development of new products .",
