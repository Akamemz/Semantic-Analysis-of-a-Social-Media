Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly had a much different take on his show Monday night , offering that more whites are killed by police than blacks .\n`` In 2012 , 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police . There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. , '' O'Reilly said on his program . `` Same year , 326 whites were killed by police bullets . Those are the latest stats available . ''\nTwo dramatically different statistics -- and they could both be right .\nThat reality , in part a result of weak local reporting and national data gathering efforts on police homicides , has long frustrated researchers and analysts who say they need to know more about those shootings .\nHere 's how the two pundits came to such dramatically different conclusions :\nKristof was citing an analysis by ProPublica , which combed through the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Supplementary Homicide Report .\nThe site reported : `` The 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks , age 15 to 19 , were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million , while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police . ''\nWhat 's key is that ProPublica narrowed the scope of its analysis to the 15-to-19 age range , and adjusted for population differences to account for the fact that more whites live in the United States than blacks -- both key differences from O'Reilly 's approach .\nThe Fox News host 's numbers , meanwhile , came from a fatal injury database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nA search in 2012 for deaths caused by `` legal intervention '' as a result of the use of a firearm -- that is , a police shooting -- yields just the numbers O'Reilly cited Monday night . In the 15-19 age range , the database shows 20 white people killed in 2012 and 14 blacks .\nThe problem , experts say , is that the United States does n't collect accurate statistics and verify nearly enough information to show definitive trends in police shootings .\n`` There is n't a mandatory reporting . It is a self-reporting . Almost on the honor system , '' Sunny Hostin , a CNN legal analyst , said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' on Tuesday .\n`` Although the FBI does have some statistics , most people know that those statistics ca n't even be counted upon , because they are self-reported , '' Hostin said . `` So my suggestion has been all along that we need mandatory reporting from our law enforcement agencies around the country and I think that the number of officer shootings involving young black males is actually much higher than is even self-reported . That 's something that needs to be part of the conversation . ''\nGeoff Alpert , a University of South Carolina criminologist , recently told USA Today the FBI 's database can confirm police have shot and killed people -- but provides few other details .\nThe numbers are self-reported by individual law enforcement agencies and not all local and state agencies participate .
