    "content": "Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears . I come not to praise Marco Rubio \u2013 dear God , never , ever that \u2013 but to bury him . And then to salt the earth in the hope that he will never come back .\nThe Rubio campaign is on its last legs , stumbling dehydrated and desperate through the Florida Everglades like the heroine in the second act of a Carl Hiaasen novel , trying to stay one step ahead of the bloodhounds who want nothing more than to drag the Florida senator into the swamp and tear his throat out , or at least convince him to join with Ted Cruz on some sort of unity ticket to stop Donald Trump , which might be an even worse fate .\nThe establishment is telling Rubio his dropping out would be for the good of the Republican Party . Which is why he \u2019 ll probably at least consider it . He is a party man through and through , and since he gave up his Senate seat to run for president , he \u2019 s going to want to come out of this cluster-screw of a campaign with something to show for it besides the humiliation of a crushing defeat in his home state \u2019 s primary on Tuesday . Run for vice-president on a ticket with Cruz , the party will whisper in his ear , and when he gets destroyed in the general election in the fall and the country suffers through four years of socialism under a Democrat , you \u2019 ll be perfectly positioned to be the 2020 nominee . What \u2019 s not to like about that scenario ? And why wouldn \u2019 t you trust a GOP establishment that has displayed such a sharp political acumen this cycle that it just about handed its nomination over to a jar of orange marmalade in a bad wig before it knew what hit it ?\nRubio might not be smart , but he \u2019 s a politician who can read poll numbers . It must have sunk in by now that his \u201c Baghdad Bob \u201d primary strategy ( claim victory even when you came in a distant third/the American military is a block away and roaring towards you unopposed ) has been a galactic failure . With even his financial backers and editorial page cheerleaders telling him it \u2019 s time , he must feel like Butch Coolidge getting the order to take his ass down in the fifth .\nThe post-mortem on Rubio \u2019 s campaign will point to many , many moments that sealed his fate . The base never fully trusted him after his role in the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in the Senate , which he later had to renounce in the hope of pacifying the conservative mouth-breathers who were inundating his office with hate mail . There was his apparent circuit-breaker malfunction in the New Hampshire debate against Chris Christie . There was his late-in-the-campaign attempt to turn into Don Rickles in order to stand up to Trump , which only seemed to cause his poll numbers to crash . There were his ham-handed attempts to get to the farthest right edge of the Republican field on every issue from abortion to fighting terrorism , the latter of which resulted in his spouting the sorts of fearful , doom-laden paranoia about ISIS terrorists coming ashore in Biscayne Bay that might tickle the GOP base but erased Rubio \u2019 s image as the sunny and optimistic young man who could lead America into a booming future .\nIt is that last one that I think comes closest to explaining his flameout . It stems from the 30,000-feet view of Marco Rubio the politician , an ambitious young man with no accomplishments or real-world experience to qualify him , who would don whatever suit \u2013 neocon hawk , religious extremist , crazy guy hollering about a war on Christianity from a steam grate \u2013 he or his advisers thought the GOP electorate wanted at any given moment , no matter how awkward the fit . He was the best example of a blow-dried establishment candidate this cycle , so perfect he might have been grown in that space station lab in \u201c Alien : Resurrection \u201d where they kept all those malformed Ripley clones , and raised to be the great hope of the Republican Party . In an era where carefully maintaining and presenting a focus group-approved persona to the world is the paramount goal of almost every politician at the national level , Rubio still stood out for how many of his edges had been sanded off .\nRubio was the product of personal ambition in overdrive and married to a Republican Party that has bought so fully into the idea that our current president was elected despite being an unaccomplished lightweight , all it had to do was roll out another young , telegenic pol with a non-WASPy last name and the White House would be the GOP \u2019 s to lose . Never mind the lack of accomplishments , or the fact he was a career politician who had barely seen a time in his adult life when he wasn \u2019 t collecting a government paycheck while dining with lobbyists . Never mind that when he spoke in debates , his talking points , which were mostly warmed-over standard-issue conservative pabulum , all sounded so memorized that you could half-imagine him cramming with flash cards the night before in a dorm room decorated with a Dan Marino poster . Never mind the awkward attempts to connect with young people \u2013 did you know that Marco loves the rap music ? \u2013 while spouting anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage positions that are as out of place in the twenty-first century as a horse and buggy .\nIt would have been much more hilarious , if it hadn \u2019 t also felt so desperate .\nRubio and his handlers seemed to think he could cruise to the nomination on the strength of an appeal that was as chimerical as a unicorn . To that end , he never really built much of a ground game for his campaign , a fact that observers have been harping on for months . His team seemed to think that it was running some sort of high-tech , futuristic operation where retail politics didn \u2019 t matter , where you could , as one adviser infamously put it , save on office rent by having your entire team set up in a Starbucks and use the free wifi . Meanwhile , he seemed to spend as much time huddling with wealthy financial backers behind closed doors as he did getting in front of voters . And while he was flying around being not quite as visible as he needed to be to voters , Rubio missed so much time at his day job , and publicly proclaimed he didn \u2019 t care because the Senate bored him anyway , that it became easy to view him as a lazy , entitled dilettante . No amount of repeating the story of his humble beginnings \u2013 did you know his dad was a bartender ? \u2013 was going to overcome that .\nIt \u2019 s possible he could still come back and run for statewide office in Florida , but one has to think Rubio \u2019 s career in national politics is over .
