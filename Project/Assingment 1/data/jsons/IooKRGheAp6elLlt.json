Mr. Trump \u2019 s Saturday morning tweets on the subject appeared to have been sparked by news reports in right-wing media \u2013 though none of those reports alleged that former President Obama was directly involved in purported surveillance of Trump associates .\nYet on Monday morning administration aides were doubling down on Trump \u2019 s assertion . The president \u201c firmly believes that the Obama administration may have tapped into the phones at Trump Tower , \u201d deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d show Monday .\nMeanwhile , Democrats and some Republicans said the weekend \u2019 s events made a bipartisan probe headed by a special prosecutor more necessary than ever . Trump \u2019 s wild charges have greatly raised the stakes of the Russia issue , they said , as they allege deep illegality throughout the United States government .\nIndeed , news reports Monday said FBI Director James Comey is pressing the Justice Department to publicly reject the charge that Mr. Obama ordered the tapping of Trump \u2019 s phones . Such a statement would be an extraordinary , perhaps unprecedented rebuke of a sitting US president .\nGiven the situation , some legal analysts say that more than ever the nation needs a public airing of Russia \u2019 s attempts to meddle in US politics .\n\u201c There is now an urgent need for independent investigations \u2013 including a special prosecutor and the Justice Department \u2019 s Inspector General \u2013 to look into the underlying evidence that the FBI had of Russian connections prior to the election , \u201d wrote Richard Painter , chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush , and coeditor Ryan Goodman on the Just Security legal blog on Sunday .\nThe American public appears to agree . CNN reported Monday that according to a new poll , about two-thirds of Americans want a special prosecutor to investigate the contacts between Russians and Trump campaign aides . CNN said , however , that Trump \u2019 s approval rating was virtually unchanged in the poll , rising from 44 percent in January to 45 percent .\nThe tweet storm that roiled US politics rolled quickly out of Trump \u2019 s Twitter feed early Saturday morning . \u201c Terrible ! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018 wires tapped \u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory . Nothing found . This is McCarthyism ! \u201d Trump wrote , in the first of four tweets on the subject .\nTrump has yet to explain the source of his education on this subject . A story from the Breitbart website alleging Department of Justice wiretapping of Trump figures , pursuant to legal proceedings , has reportedly circulated in the administration in recent days . It \u2019 s possible , even likely , that Trump was channeling his interpretation of a Thursday broadcast by conservative radio host Mark Levin .\nIf Trump has further inside knowledge on the allegation , he would have been revealing classified information by talking about it .\nUnder the law , US presidents can \u2019 t order wiretaps of Americans in a national security investigation . Such taps are requested by federal law enforcement and approved by a court whose proceedings are secret .\nThat \u2019 s why an Obama spokesman replied to Trump \u2019 s charges by saying they are \u201c simply false . \u201d\n\u201c Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen , \u201d said Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis .\nIf Obama did in fact order Trump \u2019 s phones tapped , it would be a scandal as big as Watergate . But if a federal court approved surveillance of a Trump associate \u2013 as the Breitbart story alleges \u2013 that would be pursuant to probable cause that illegal contact was occurring .\nThe upshot of this is that Trump \u2019 s allegations may have the opposite effect of his possible intent . If he wanted it to distract attention from his own Russia problem , by turning a light on his predecessor , he may find that light shown on his campaign if the surveillance warrant , and its charges , become public .\n\u201c Talk about walking yourself into a box canyon , \u201d said Rep.
