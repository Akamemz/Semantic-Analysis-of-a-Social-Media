    "content": "A response to Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times .\nIn a provocative Sunday opinion piece for the New York Times , Jamelle Bouie takes aim at the United States Senate . It is \u201c is highly undemocratic and strikingly unrepresentative \u201d institution , dominated by a \u201c Republican coalition of rural whites , exurban whites and anti-tax suburbanites. \u201d This needs to be changed \u2014 because everybody knows it is un-American to oppose higher taxes !\nBouie offers an outside-the-box idea . Rather than change the Senate via constitutional amendment , progressives should look to increase the number of Democrats in the Senate by giving representation in the Senate to non-state units\u2014 \u201c Washington , D.C. , the Atlantic territories , the Pacific territories and the Native tribes . \u201d\nNormally , I do not write columns responding to other columns . But Bouie \u2019 s piece is typical of the progressive Left \u2019 s frustration with the Senate , as well as of an inability to reckon with its role in our constitutional regime . For these reasons , it merits a thorough examination .\nFor starters , full disclosure : I get it . The Senate is not democratic , and in a republic , that is problematic . All else being equal , I would agree with Bouie . But all else is not equal . This is in fact a very old debate , whose context demands some thoughtful appreciation before slashing changes are made . Why do you think the Constitutional Convention dragged on through the entire summer of 1787 ? James Madison , James Wilson , and other federalists from the large states insisted on a fully majoritarian system . But the small-state representatives , including John Dickinson and Roger Sherman , said , No dice \u2014 you want our assent to this Constitution , we need guarantees .\nInterestingly , Bouie seems to be on the side of Dickenson and Sherman \u2014 or at least sympathetic . He calls the population disparity between Delaware and Virginia \u201c a large disparity , but not a yawning one. \u201d I do not understand this difference from the standpoint of the principle Bouie is defending . Is the implication that a little bit of anti-democratic bias okay , but past a certain point it is a bad thing ? Was the Senate fair in 1787 , but not in 2019 ? When did it become unfair ?\nI \u2019 ve never figured out why progressives think that shifts in population disparities are a salient historical point . Assume that the disparity between Delaware and Virginia in 1787 was as great as the disparity between California and Wyoming . Wouldn \u2019 t Dickenson have fought even harder for the Senate as it \u2019 s currently apportioned ? If anything , he would have probably fought to retain the original structure of the Continental Congress . Otherwise , Delaware would be swamped in the House of Representatives !\nAnd I am not at all sure how giving senators to Guam and Northern Mariana Islands will make the Senate more democratic . Won \u2019 t it in fact make it less democratic ? How are Los Angelinos and New Yorkers going to have their interests and views better represented in the Senate because the U.S. Virgin Islands is also included ? Is Bouie advocating the idea of virtual representation , akin to what the British Parliament backed in the face of colonial protests in the 1770s , whereby progressives in the underrepresented populous states will be \u201c represented \u201d by the progressive senators added from the non-states ? Or is it simply okay for the Senate to be anti-democratic , just so long as it is not anti-Democratic ?\nRegardless , enough is enough for Bouie . The Senate has become a threat to our way of life , and that requires action ! Bouie , like many progressives\u00ad , pushes in two directions . The first is to make it easier for the Senate to act by eliminating the filibuster . The second is to make the Senate more \u201c democratic \u201d by increasing the number of Democrats .\nBut won \u2019 t these aims be contradictory in practice ? Bouie suggests that eliminating the filibuster should be a priority for the next Democratic Senate \u2014 presumably before his structural reforms ( which would be more difficult ) would take effect . So what happens if the GOP gets the Senate back before American Samoa gets representation in the Senate ? Without the filibuster , evil Republicans will be able to run roughshod over the land like the Visigoths of late antiquity , using net neutrality and tax reform to slaughter untold millions .\nAnd forgive me if this sounds gauche , but how about progressives . . . y \u2019 know . . . try to win over rural America ? Bouie dismisses this proposal with a wave of the rhetorical hand . \u201c And while this coalition \u2014 or its Democratic counterpart of liberal whites and the overwhelming majority of nonwhites \u2014 isn \u2019 t set in stone , it could be years , even decades , before we see meaningful change in the demographic contours of our partisan divides. \u201d So much for that idea ! The way Bouie and many progressives present the divide in this country , rural America is hopelessly committed to a kind of ideological revanchism .\nYet even a cursory reading of American history illustrates that , in many ages , it was rural America that was more progressive . Who propelled William Jennings Bryan and his firebrand populism in 1896 ? Rural America . Who secured Woodrow Wilson a second term in the White House , vindicating the progressive reforms of his first term ? Rural America . Which faction in the Democratic party backed the more progressive FDR over the more conservative Al Smith in the 1932 nomination ? Rural America .

One might actually argue that the task is not as hard as it once was .
