    "content": "Sixty-six years ago , Marion Ford , an ambitious Houston teenager who had been set to become one of the first African American undergraduates at the University of Texas , received a terse letter returning his $ 20 deposit to room in an all-Black dormitory because his admission had been rescinded .\nThe transgression committed by Marion Ford , a saxophonist , writer , academic standout , star athlete , and all-around striver ? He told a reporter he wanted to try out for the all-white Texas Longhorns football team .\nThe Ford episode in 1954 unspools over a series of documents , many of them marked confidential , resting deep within the University of Texas archives . I came across these documents while working on a book about football and race in Texas . Among other things they illuminate how far the university \u2019 s regents were willing to go to keep their beloved football team free of Black players . That previous May , the US Supreme Court had handed down its Brown v. Board decision , and the regents , each appointed by a segregationist governor , were determined to interpret the ruling in the narrowest way possible . The Ford crisis\u2014it was nothing less than that to the men controlling the university\u2014was one of the first tests following the Brown decision of how a state university would fold in newly admitted Black students . Within weeks the state \u2019 s most powerful figures had convened to thwart the mere prospect of a Black teenager setting foot on the field .\nThere \u2019 s a larger story to be found in these and other confidential documents . More than a half-century later , they offer a glimpse of how American apartheid was maintained even after parts of it had been formally struck down\u2014how , in particular , state and university bureaucracies were marshaled to serve segregationists \u2019 ends . Methodically , insidiously , memo by banal memo , administrators constructed a two-tiered system at their university . To see the evidence of this up close , to hold these flimsy pieces of onionskin paper in your hands\u2014carbon copies , filed away in folders marked \u201c Negroes \u201d \u2014is to understand something essential about segregation . Jim Crow was office work , too .\nFord had been a top student at his all-Black high school when , in June 1954 , he applied to the state \u2019 s flagship university . The Brown decision had been handed down in May and he was determined to capitalize on its promise . He was a go-getter : In his young life he had already worked as a newspaper carrier , a truck driver , a lifeguard , and a columnist for the school newspaper ; known by the nickname Big Drip , he was a talented kid , well-liked and gregarious , keen to dance , a member of the engineering honor society .\nIn his application he said he wanted to major in chemistry . At first , UT officials put him off , suggesting he instead attend Texas Southern , a historically Black university . Ford thought he was getting the runaround , and he said as much\u2014 \u201c Southern Discrimination \u201d was the phrase he used in a letter back to UT \u2019 s dean of admissions , H.Y . McCown . \u201c I am not interested in living in your dormitories or becoming socially prominent with the Caucasians , \u201d Ford wrote , \u201c but I do want a chance to get the best formal training in my state. \u201d In a condescending letter of admittance in late July , McCown wrote back to Ford , \u201c I hope that you will do well in the University and that you will get over your inferiority complex and the idea that you are being discriminated against . \u201d\nFinally , all appeared set for Ford and a half-dozen other young African American men to become the first class of Black undergraduates at the university . On August 16 , the university sent him a room contract for San Jacinto Dormitory D , and Ford mailed in a $ 20 deposit . Around that time , he also submitted a rushee information card to UT \u2019 s Interfraternity Council , still on file in a warehouse of university records . He wrote that he planned to join the ROTC program , and in a sign of his eagerness , he asked that a copy of the fraternity handbook be sent to him .\nBut there was a problem : Ford , a brawny 5-foot-10-and-a-half , 209-pounder who had been a varsity swimmer and all-state lineman in high school , told a Houston reporter a week later that he hoped to play on UT \u2019 s football team .\nThe reporter , in turn , contacted UT regent Leroy Jeffers , a Houston attorney , to ask for comment . Jeffers said the regents hadn \u2019 t considered the prospect but that it would be weighed \u201c from all angles for the best interest of the university. \u201d Privately , Jeffers was alarmed . The following day , he sent a copy of the article\u2014headlined \u201c Houston Negro Seeks Grid Tryout at Texas \u201d \u2014to the members of the board of regents and the chancellor . It was one thing to admit African Americans , another to allow them to play on the football team\u2014or really to let them represent the university in any capacity . On the very day , August 25 , 1954 , that Jeffers sent the article to the regents , Arno Nowotny , the widely beloved dean of student life at the university , wrote to UT President Logan Wilson about the problem of Black students who wanted to study at the university and also participate in the school band . \u201c An undergraduate Negro student , J. L. Jewett , has inquired about playing in our Longhorn Band in the fall , \u201d Nowotny wrote . \u201c I hope we continue to admit Negro students only when we have to do so . I could wish that young Jewett had chosen the symphonic band or some other less spectacular student activity ; but I plan to have a real conference with him , and stress the importance of his showing real humility in his band participation . \u201d\nFive days later , the regents chair , Tom Sealy , a Midland oil exec , went to the state attorney general with a question . This was John Ben Shepperd , who the following year would sue the NAACP in an attempt to disband it . Sealy wanted to know if the university was required \u201c to permit such negro students upon admission to participate in such extracurricular activities as band and football or other intercollegiate activities. \u201d That same day , the university \u2019 s dean of admissions wrote to the UT president that African Americans were taking \u201c a more calculated approach \u201d in their applications . There was some truth to this : The applicants , in league with civil rights activists , were quite reasonably trying to force the issue of their admittance\u2014after all , the university , in defiance of the Brown decision , was still trying to push them to historically Black schools . After McCown told Ford that chemistry was offered at Texas Southern , for instance , Ford told him that he in fact wanted to study chemical engineering , a major not offered at Texas Southern . \u201c They are now carefully advised and are constantly probing for programs of work not offered at one of the Negro institutions , \u201d he wrote .\nIn a memo marked \u201c personal and confidential , \u201d Sealy informed the other regents that after a \u201c full investigation , \u201d the university had determined that Black students could take at least their first-year classes at Black institutions . In other words , even if Texas Southern did not have a chemical engineering major , it had first-year offerings that mirrored UT \u2019 s . The plan was essentially a delay tactic , meant to buy the University of Texas at least another year in which to figure out how to prevent Black students from enrolling .\nAnd so , less than two weeks after Marion Ford had told the Houston Chronicle he wanted to try out for the football team , letters were sent to him and the other incoming African Americans , explaining that their admission had been rescinded . The university president , the regents , the university lawyers , and the state attorney general had huddled up and decided to bring down the full weight of the Texas government and its flagship university on this teenager and a half-dozen other African American admits for the crime of wanting to represent the school on the football field .\nOn September 3 , Ford was refunded the $ 20 deposit for his room at a dormitory for Black students only , and he was informed by the university \u2019 s director for auxiliary and service activities that the rooming contract was \u201c now voided. \u201d \u201c The Dean of Admissions at The University of Texas \u201d \u2014McCown\u2014 \u201c has notified this office that your application for admission to the University as a student has been canceled , \u201d said the letter , a copy of which was sent to the university president , confirming again that the university \u2019 s highest ranks were involved .\nThe sacrosanct football program remained unsullied , and some Texans who learned about the university administration \u2019 s about-face were pleased . J. L. Shanklin , a dentist in the Hill Country town of Kerrville , wrote McCown \u201c to congratulate you on your very sane stand in re\u2013the case of Marion G. Ford Jr. \u201d : \u201c The problem is not one of racial , religious , social , or political , but is one of our Constitutional rights\u2026If Democracy is the best form of government and is to survive , we will have to fully subscribe to the theory that the majority must supersede the wants and claims of the minority . Surely the majority of Texans does not want to accept racial equality , nor do they want to foster a situation that will surely lead to social and sexual homogeneity . \u201d\nJudging by the clippings stored in the UT archives , there was little mention in the press of UT \u2019 s backtracking , apart from a one-sentence item in the Informer , a Houston Black newspaper . The story noted that Ford had been \u201c rejected then accepted and rejected again , \u201d a line that in its weariness suggests something of the condition of being Black in America .\n\u201c One can visualize ( with a shudder ) the disturbance arising because a Negro attempted to sit next to or near a white person who had definite adverse feelings in such matters , \u201d wrote Lanier Cox , the assistant to the UT president .\nAthletics , and football in particular , presented UT with a logistical conundrum : Even as it was resisting the integration of its student body , would the university ban other schools from bringing their Black athletes to UT \u2019 s fields and tracks ? In 1956 , the University of Southern California football team and its star running back , Cornelius Roberts , a Black man , were scheduled to play in Austin . UT officials deliberated over how to handle the prospect of Black fans showing up to the game . \u201c One can visualize ( with a shudder ) the disturbance arising because a Negro attempted to sit next to or near a white person who had definite adverse feelings in such matters , \u201d Lanier Cox , the assistant to the UT president , wrote to Sealy , still the regents chair , two and a half months before the game . Cox warned : \u201c Since the University of Southern California has a star Negro fullback , it is entirely possible that his parents or friends from California may make the trip to Austin . It would be difficult to control the sale of tickets by visiting schools . Therefore , it would appear that little could be done other than to admit Negroes holding tickets in the visiting team section. \u201d As for other Black people seeking to buy tickets , he said , \u201c It is recommended that the Negro section in the stadium be continued and that all Negroes who ask for tickets be sold a seat only in this section . This should reduce substantially the possibility of Negroes sitting among the white spectators in the west stands and thereby creating a situation of possible ill feeling or even violence . \u201d\nIn the end , Roberts , nicknamed the Chocolate Rocket , ran roughshod over the Longhorns , racking up 251 yards and three touchdowns . UT lost 44\u201320 en route to a 1\u20139 season . Among the spectators at that game was Marion Ford . He had played for Illinois before coming back to Austin as a transfer student , among the first Black undergrads admitted in 1956 . Not long after the game , Ford approached UT head coach Ed Price to again float the idea of walking on as the university \u2019 s first Black football player . \u201c Ed , \u201d Ford said , according to Richard Pennington \u2019 s Breaking the Ice : The Racial Integration of Southwest Conference Football , \u201c you need me . I can help you. \u201d ( \u201c I was a cocky son of a bitch , \u201d Ford later told Dwonna Goldstone for her excellent book Integrating the 40 Acres . ) Price , who had not had a winning season in several years and who must have known he was likely to be fired at the end of the season , shrugged off Ford \u2019 s suggestion . \u201c He was very amiable , \u201d Ford , who eventually built a successful dental practice and remained a frequent face at Houston-area UT alumni events until his death in 2001 , later told a reporter . \u201c He knew he needed help . But he said , \u2018 It \u2019 s out of my hands. \u2019 \u2026 It would have been a good stroke for Texas , a beautiful opportunity for a premier university to forge ahead and a hell of a rallying point . \u201d\nMaintaining segregation after Brown was hard bureaucratic work . It required technical clarifications , legal rationalizations , stalling tactics , even a new standardized testing regime to keep people like Marion Ford off campus . \u201c The Brown decision was hardly self-executing at the University of Texas , \u201d the legal historian Thomas D. Russell , who has written about how racial considerations shaped UT in the 20th century , has dryly noted . The logistics of apartheid led to occasional confusion . \u201c For the second or third time now since 1955 my own department has had a bona fide and quite unsolicited application for a teaching assistantship from a Negro graduate student , \u201d Leo Hughes , chair of the English department , wrote the university president on May 22 , 1961 . \u201c On at least one previous occasion we rejected the application , in spite of a most impressive record. \u201d The letter concluded : \u201c What is the current administrative policy on the hiring of Negro teaching assistants ? \u201d Four days later came an answer : The university \u2019 s policy \u201c is not to employ a Negro as an assistant teaching in the classroom but as an assistant assigned to a research project , \u201d wrote president Joseph Smiley , a soft-spoken scholar of French from Dallas . \u201c I think all of us concerned realized that this is an extremely delicate and complex problem. \u201d Seven years after the Brown decision , the UT president deemed it okay for Black people to do lab work , behind closed doors , but not okay for Black people to oversee white undergrads .\nThe following March , Smiley got a note from the dean of students , who wanted him to weigh in on another evidently tricky issue : The Longhorn band had gotten inquiries from a Black high school in Dallas about its membership rules . One asked , simply : \u201c Are Negroes eligible for membership in the Longhorn Band ? \u201d \u201c It is my understanding that Negroes have previously been auditioned but have not been able to demonstrate the quality necessary for membership in the band , \u201d the dean wrote to Smiley .\nThe machinery of segregation ran on patrician smarm , too . On July 20 , 1961 , Mo Olian , the undergraduate president of the Texas students association , told a Daily Texan reporter that the latest decision by the regents to resist integration was \u201c narrow-minded , backward and hypocritical . \u201d\nThornton Hardie , a West Texas attorney who was the bespectacled chair of the regents , was affronted . On August 2 , he sent the undergraduate a page-long letter defending the regents as \u201c gentlemen of the highest type \u201d who had \u201c given unselfishly of their time and talents toward the progress and well-being of the University . \u201d\n\u201c I trust you have now recovered from your unfortunate loss of temper and that you regret your choice of language , which was highly insulting to these fine gentlemen , \u201d Hardie wrote . \u201c I hope you will now agree that an appropriate written apology to the members of the Board of Regents is in order , and that I am the one to whom such an apology should be address. \u201d Olian declined to apologize . Athletics and dormitories remained segregated through the early 1960s .\nIn a note to other regents , Hardie suggested that as part of UT \u2019 s publicity campaign , it \u201c should at least be mentioned \u201d that Olian and David Lopez , the managing editor of the campus newspaper , \u201c are certainly living examples of the lack of religious and social prejudice at The University. \u201d Lopez is Hispanic ; Olian , Jewish . ( Olian would go on to have a successful real estate investment career in Austin . When I tracked him down and showed him the documents , he told me , \u201c I \u2019 m still amazed how at that young age they tried to impugn my integrity . \u201d )\nOne mid-October evening in 1961 , three Black undergraduate women gathered in the lobby of Kinsolving , a white-only dormitory , despite warnings from the dorm matron , and went upstairs for half an hour to the rooms of some of their white friends before being forced to leave . The Black dorms were rickety , old , wood-frame buildings ; Kinsolving was brick and stone .\nThe regents were furious . In a letter to his fellow board members , a regent named W.W. Heath said the university should commission a survey of the parents of white girls whose dorms might be integrated . \u201c They are paying the bills , have a more mature viewpoint [ than students ] , and know best what is good for their own children . An appropriate poll question would be : \u2018 Do you favor complete integration of our girls dormitories , realizing this may require you ( or your daughter ) to room with colored girls , have your meals with them , and receive your dates in the same dormitory parlors with their dates , further realizing that any partial integration of such dormitories would merely be a step toward complete integration ? \u2019 \u201d\nThe tone came unhinged . Hardie now recommended that the university tell the parents of two white women who were involved in the sit-in \u201c that if their daughters will promptly give the President of the University and the Manager in charge of Kinsolving a letter of apology , with a promise not to repeat the offense , they would be forgiven . Of course , it should be understood that the letters of apology would be subject to publication. \u201d If they won \u2019 t apologize , he wrote , they should be made to leave the dorm within two weeks . \u201c At the end of that time , if they had not left we should remove their belongings from their room and lock the door , and we should see that they were not allowed to reenter . It is quite true that they might file suit for damages , but we would have to take that risk . \u201d\n\u201c I have had negroes around me all my life and still employ them in my office and in my home\u2026If you treat them as your equal they will want to date the white girls and etc . and I mean etc. , \u201d wrote Waldo Pauls , scion of a Houston cotton merchant .\nMany alumni were horrified at integration efforts . \u201c I have had negroes around me all my life and still employ them in my office and in my home , \u201d Waldo Pauls , scion of a Houston cotton merchant and a UT alumnus , wrote to the UT president shortly after the sit-in . \u201c They are like children and if given an inch they will take a mile . If you treat them as your equal they will want to date the white girls and etc . and I mean etc. \u201d Perhaps mindful of offending powerful donors , the university correspondence to racist alumni ranged from meek to obsequious . The UT president , Smiley , wrote Pauls that \u201c all of us concerned feel that this is an extremely critical situation , and I assure you that we are doing our utmost to make the right decision. \u201d In November 1961 , an East Texas attorney and UT law graduate , Billy Hunt , also wrote Smiley about a complaint he had received from a wealthy , elderly client whom he had encouraged to leave at least $ 10,000 of his estate to the University of Texas . The client had learned that a University of Texas law professor had circulated a petition calling for the end of segregated facilities on campus :\nToday , I was called upon by this gentleman to prepare another will which omitted this bequest . This was all brought about by the idiotic action of the faculty in general , and one of the professors of the law school , in particular , in pushing through some sort of resolution calling for the removal of segregation practices in regard to the restrooms in the dormitories . When the story appeared in the press , this client , who has rather strong feelings on the matter , came to my office and stated that he would leave no money to any institution which would harbor such people on its faculty . Frankly , I could not work up too much enthusiasm in trying to get him to change his mind .\nSmiley , the UT president , wrote to Hunt to say his letter \u201c obviously distresses me. \u201d \u201c It is clear , of course , that we can not afford to sustain the loss of any potential private support , for , as you know , this kind of support is indispensable our goal of achieving high academic excellence , \u201d Smiley said , explaining that the administration and board of regents \u201c are doing our utmost to define and attain the wisest possible solution of these problems . \u201d\nInstead of backing down as the regents had demanded , the young women who \u2019 d participated in the sit-in chose to file suit . A UT law professor who served as their counselor was deemed a traitor by the regents . The sit-in became a cause : When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited the campus in March 1962 to give a talk on segregation\u2014before an audience of 1,200 people on a campus that was less than 1 percent Black\u2014he announced that \u201c Old Man Segregation is on his deathbed . The only question is how expensive the South is going to make the funeral. \u201d And in May a national chemical engineering conference to be hosted by UT was suddenly put in jeopardy because one of the member associations had complained . \u201c Unfortunately there appears to be real danger that we will lose the conference if we do not act soon to correct a minor technicality in our dormitory regulations , \u201d an engineering dean wrote to Smiley , the university president . The \u201c minor technicality \u201d was that the dorms were segregated by race\u2014and one of the participating engineering societies from elsewhere in the country had raised an objection .\nThe segregation of the dorms had practical , nearly farcical consequences . A small note to the university president in the summer of 1962 , at a time when white and Black housing remained segregated , reports that a pair of Black kids in Austin for a high school band conference at UT had found that their rooms lacked air conditioning . In mid-June , at the time of this conference , Austin broils . \u201c Literature about the conference mentioned air-conditioned quarters , \u201d says the index card note . \u201c Presumably Nelson Patrick , who is in charge , had checked and all the students attending were supposed to be white . \u201d\nFacing pressure from the dorm integration lawsuit , UT Chancellor Harry Ransom told the student-plaintiffs to withdraw the suit in the spring of 1964 , a few months before President Lyndon Johnson was due to give the university commencement address . Keen to end a legal showdown they were likely to lose and concerned about their relationship with Washington , university officials pledged to \u201c voluntarily \u201d integrate the dorms on their own .\n\u201c That was part of the reason why the University wanted to integrate as fast as possible , \u201d one of the plaintiffs , Sherryl Griffin , told the Daily Texan in 2016 . \u201c So that when the President of the United States came , the University would not still be involved in the punitive legacy of our lawsuit . \u201d\nUT also faced the real possibility , with the impending passage of the Civil Rights Act that year , that it would have to forfeit federal funding if it remained , on paper , segregated . Heath , an East Texas attorney who was an old friend of Johnson \u2019 s and now chaired the board of regents , admitted that he \u201c came on the board with a lot of prejudices \u201d and did not realize that \u201c on federal research grants , you get cut off a lot of places if you \u2019 re not integrated. \u201d The president , in other words , forced his hand . At its meeting on May 16 , 1964 , the board of regents ordered the full integration of the university . According to the self-congratulatory official minutes of the meeting , \u201c the Board completed its task of \u2018 integration with all deliberate speed \u2019 as promised , and without troops , marshals , violence or bloodshed . \u201d\nToday the University of Texas has sought to repair the historic wrongs . It has an Office for Inclusion and Equity , hosts an annual conference focused on issues facing Black student-athletes , and welcomes pioneering African American admits back for an annual reunion , and even finds itself under attack in the courts for its affirmative action policies . \u201c For half of UT \u2019 s 135 years , the university did not admit African American students , \u201d university president Gregory Fenves said in a 2018 speech . \u201c Our history of exclusion and segregation gives us a responsibility to stand as champions of the educational benefits of diversity . \u201d\nThe history of segregation at UT , as at other Southern universities , is not so ancient . On a beautiful mid-October evening in Austin , at halftime of a game against Kansas , members of the 1969 national championship football team gathered at midfield and held aloft their Hook \u2018 Em Horns hand signs . Marking the 50th anniversary of that Longhorn campaign , the band struck up \u201c The Eyes of Texas , \u201d and the crowd of more than 97,000 fans took to their feet in burnt-orange salute . It was a poignant moment : Here were aging athletes being regaled once more for their boyhood feats . But there was little or no official reckoning with a singular fact : that this group was the last all-white team to win the national championship . The first Black player didn \u2019 t make the varsity team until 1970\u2014at least a half-dozen years after the regents had decided , on paper , to fully integrate the university and 16 years after Marion Ford had announced his desire to play ball .\nAsher Price is a staff reporter at the Austin American-Statesman . His new book is Earl Campbell : Yards After Contact , from which part of this article is adapted .",
    "content_original": "Sixty-six years ago, Marion Ford, an ambitious Houston teenager who had been set to become one of the first African American undergraduates at the University of Texas, received a terse letter returning his $20 deposit to room in an all-Black dormitory because his admission had been rescinded.\n\nThe transgression committed by Marion Ford, a saxophonist, writer, academic standout, star athlete, and all-around striver?

Jeffers said the regents hadn\u2019t considered the prospect but that it would be weighed \u201cfrom all angles for the best interest of the university.\u201d Privately, Jeffers was alarmed. The following day, he sent a copy of the article\u2014headlined \u201cHouston Negro Seeks Grid Tryout at Texas\u201d\u2014to the members of the board of regents and the chancellor. It was one thing to admit African Americans, another to allow them to play on the football team\u2014or really to let them represent the university in any capacity. On the very day, August 25, 1954, that Jeffers sent the article to the regents, Arno Nowotny, the widely beloved dean of student life at the university, wrote to UT President Logan Wilson about the problem of Black students who wanted to study at the university and also participate in the school band. \u201cAn undergraduate Negro student, J. L. Jewett, has inquired about playing in our Longhorn Band in the fall,\u201d Nowotny wrote. \u201cI hope we continue to admit Negro students only when we have to do so. I could wish that young Jewett had chosen the symphonic band or some other less spectacular student activity; but I plan to have a real conference with him, and stress the importance of his showing real humility in his band participation.\u201d\n\nFive days later, the regents chair, Tom Sealy, a Midland oil exec, went to the state attorney general with a question. This was John Ben Shepperd, who the following year would sue the NAACP in an attempt to disband it. Sealy wanted to know if the university was required \u201cto permit such negro students upon admission to participate in such extracurricular activities as band and football or other intercollegiate activities.\u201d That same day, the university\u2019s dean of admissions wrote to the UT president that African Americans were taking \u201ca more calculated approach\u201d in their applications. There was some truth to this: The applicants, in league with civil rights activists, were quite reasonably trying to force the issue of their admittance\u2014after all, the university, in defiance of the Brown decision, was still trying to push them to historically Black schools. After McCown told Ford that chemistry was offered at Texas Southern, for instance, Ford told him that he in fact wanted to study chemical engineering, a major not offered at Texas Southern. \u201cThey are now carefully advised and are constantly probing for programs of work not offered at one of the Negro institutions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a memo marked \u201cpersonal and confidential,\u201d Sealy informed the other regents that after a \u201cfull investigation,\u201d the university had determined that Black students could take at least their first-year classes at Black institutions. In other words, even if Texas Southern did not have a chemical engineering major, it had first-year offerings that mirrored UT\u2019s. The plan was essentially a delay tactic, meant to buy the University of Texas at least another year in which to figure out how to prevent Black students from enrolling.\n\nAnd so, less than two weeks after Marion Ford had told the Houston Chronicle he wanted to try out for the football team, letters were sent to him and the other incoming African Americans, explaining that their admission had been rescinded. The university president, the regents, the university lawyers, and the state attorney general had huddled up and decided to bring down the full weight of the Texas government and its flagship university on this teenager and a half-dozen other African American admits for the crime of wanting to represent the school on the football field.\n\nOn September 3, Ford was refunded the $20 deposit for his room at a dormitory for Black students only, and he was informed by the university\u2019s director for auxiliary and service activities that the rooming contract was \u201cnow voided.\u201d \u201cThe Dean of Admissions at The University of Texas\u201d\u2014McCown\u2014\u201chas notified this office that your application for admission to the University as a student has been canceled,\u201d said the letter, a copy of which was sent to the university president, confirming again that the university\u2019s highest ranks were involved.\n\nThe sacrosanct football program remained unsullied, and some Texans who learned about the university administration\u2019s about-face were pleased. J. L. Shanklin, a dentist in the Hill Country town of Kerrville, wrote McCown \u201cto congratulate you on your very sane stand in re\u2013the case of Marion G. Ford Jr.\u201d: \u201cThe problem is not one of racial, religious, social, or political, but is one of our Constitutional rights\u2026If Democracy is the best form of government and is to survive, we will have to fully subscribe to the theory that the majority must supersede the wants and claims of the minority. Surely the majority of Texans does not want to accept racial equality, nor do they want to foster a situation that will surely lead to social and sexual homogeneity.\u201d\n\nJudging by the clippings stored in the UT archives, there was little mention in the press of UT\u2019s backtracking, apart from a one-sentence item in the Informer, a Houston Black newspaper. The story noted that Ford had been \u201crejected then accepted and rejected again,\u201d a line that in its weariness suggests something of the condition of being Black in America.\n\n\u201cOne can visualize (with a shudder) the disturbance arising because a Negro attempted to sit next to or near a white person who had definite adverse feelings in such matters,\u201d wrote Lanier Cox, the assistant to the UT president.\n\nAthletics, and football in particular, presented UT with a logistical conundrum: Even as it was resisting the integration of its student body, would the university ban other schools from bringing their Black athletes to UT\u2019s fields and tracks? In 1956, the University of Southern California football team and its star running back, Cornelius Roberts, a Black man, were scheduled to play in Austin. UT officials deliberated over how to handle the prospect of Black fans showing up to the game. \u201cOne can visualize (with a shudder) the disturbance arising because a Negro attempted to sit next to or near a white person who had definite adverse feelings in such matters,\u201d Lanier Cox, the assistant to the UT president, wrote to Sealy, still the regents chair, two and a half months before the game. Cox warned: \u201cSince the University of Southern California has a star Negro fullback, it is entirely possible that his parents or friends from California may make the trip to Austin. It would be difficult to control the sale of tickets by visiting schools. Therefore, it would appear that little could be done other than to admit Negroes holding tickets in the visiting team section.\u201d As for other Black people seeking to buy tickets, he said, \u201cIt is recommended that the Negro section in the stadium be continued and that all Negroes who ask for tickets be sold a seat only in this section. This should reduce substantially the possibility of Negroes sitting among the white spectators in the west stands and thereby creating a situation of possible ill feeling or even violence.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Roberts, nicknamed the Chocolate Rocket, ran roughshod over the Longhorns, racking up 251 yards and three touchdowns. UT lost 44\u201320 en route to a 1\u20139 season. Among the spectators at that game was Marion Ford. He had played for Illinois before coming back to Austin as a transfer student, among the first Black undergrads admitted in 1956. Not long after the game, Ford approached UT head coach Ed Price to again float the idea of walking on as the university\u2019s first Black football player. \u201cEd,\u201d Ford said, according to Richard Pennington\u2019s Breaking the Ice: The Racial Integration of Southwest Conference Football, \u201cyou need me. I can help you.\u201d (\u201cI was a cocky son of a bitch,\u201d Ford later told Dwonna Goldstone for her excellent book Integrating the 40 Acres.) Price, who had not had a winning season in several years and who must have known he was likely to be fired at the end of the season, shrugged off Ford\u2019s suggestion. \u201cHe was very amiable,\u201d Ford, who eventually built a successful dental practice and remained a frequent face at Houston-area UT alumni events until his death in 2001, later told a reporter. \u201cHe knew he needed help. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s out of my hands.\u2019 \u2026 It would have been a good stroke for Texas, a beautiful opportunity for a premier university to forge ahead and a hell of a rallying point.\u201d\n\nMaintaining segregation after Brown was hard bureaucratic work. It required technical clarifications, legal rationalizations, stalling tactics, even a new standardized testing regime to keep people like Marion Ford off campus. \u201cThe Brown decision was hardly self-executing at the University of Texas,\u201d the legal historian Thomas D. Russell, who has written about how racial considerations shaped UT in the 20th century, has dryly noted. The logistics of apartheid led to occasional confusion. \u201cFor the second or third time now since 1955 my own department has had a bona fide and quite unsolicited application for a teaching assistantship from a Negro graduate student,\u201d Leo Hughes, chair of the English department, wrote the university president on May 22, 1961. \u201cOn at least one previous occasion we rejected the application, in spite of a most impressive record.\u201d The letter concluded: \u201cWhat is the current administrative policy on the hiring of Negro teaching assistants?\u201d Four days later came an answer: The university\u2019s policy \u201cis not to employ a Negro as an assistant teaching in the classroom but as an assistant assigned to a research project,\u201d wrote president Joseph Smiley, a soft-spoken scholar of French from Dallas. \u201cI think all of us concerned realized that this is an extremely delicate and complex problem.\u201d Seven years after the Brown decision, the UT president deemed it okay for Black people to do lab work, behind closed doors, but not okay for Black people to oversee white undergrads.\n\nThe following March, Smiley got a note from the dean of students, who wanted him to weigh in on another evidently tricky issue: The Longhorn band had gotten inquiries from a Black high school in Dallas about its membership rules. One asked, simply: \u201cAre Negroes eligible for membership in the Longhorn Band?\u201d \u201cIt is my understanding that Negroes have previously been auditioned but have not been able to demonstrate the quality necessary for membership in the band,\u201d the dean wrote to Smiley.\n\nThe machinery of segregation ran on patrician smarm, too. On July 20, 1961, Mo Olian, the undergraduate president of the Texas students association, told a Daily Texan reporter that the latest decision by the regents to resist integration was \u201cnarrow-minded, backward and hypocritical.\u201d\n\nThornton Hardie, a West Texas attorney who was the bespectacled chair of the regents, was affronted. On August 2, he sent the undergraduate a page-long letter defending the regents as \u201cgentlemen of the highest type\u201d who had \u201cgiven unselfishly of their time and talents toward the progress and well-being of the University.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust you have now recovered from your unfortunate loss of temper and that you regret your choice of language, which was highly insulting to these fine gentlemen,\u201d Hardie wrote. \u201cI hope you will now agree that an appropriate written apology to the members of the Board of Regents is in order, and that I am the one to whom such an apology should be address.\u201d Olian declined to apologize. Athletics and dormitories remained segregated through the early 1960s.\n\nIn a note to other regents, Hardie suggested that as part of UT\u2019s publicity campaign, it \u201cshould at least be mentioned\u201d that Olian and David Lopez, the managing editor of the campus newspaper, \u201care certainly living examples of the lack of religious and social prejudice at The University.\u201d Lopez is Hispanic; Olian, Jewish. (Olian would go on to have a successful real estate investment career in Austin. When I tracked him down and showed him the documents, he told me, \u201cI\u2019m still amazed how at that young age they tried to impugn my integrity.\u201d)\n\nOne mid-October evening in 1961, three Black undergraduate women gathered in the lobby of Kinsolving, a white-only dormitory, despite warnings from the dorm matron, and went upstairs for half an hour to the rooms of some of their white friends before being forced to leave. The Black dorms were rickety, old, wood-frame buildings; Kinsolving was brick and stone.\n\nThe regents were furious. In a letter to his fellow board members, a regent named W.W. Heath said the university should commission a survey of the parents of white girls whose dorms might be integrated. \u201cThey are paying the bills, have a more mature viewpoint [than students], and know best what is good for their own children. An appropriate poll question would be: \u2018Do you favor complete integration of our girls dormitories, realizing this may require you (or your daughter) to room with colored girls, have your meals with them, and receive your dates in the same dormitory parlors with their dates, further realizing that any partial integration of such dormitories would merely be a step toward complete integration?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe tone came unhinged. Hardie now recommended that the university tell the parents of two white women who were involved in the sit-in \u201cthat if their daughters will promptly give the President of the University and the Manager in charge of Kinsolving a letter of apology, with a promise not to repeat the offense, they would be forgiven. Of course, it should be understood that the letters of apology would be subject to publication.\u201d If they won\u2019t apologize, he wrote, they should be made to leave the dorm within two weeks. \u201cAt the end of that time, if they had not left we should remove their belongings from their room and lock the door, and we should see that they were not allowed to reenter. It is quite true that they might file suit for damages, but we would have to take that risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had negroes around me all my life and still employ them in my office and in my home\u2026If you treat them as your equal they will want to date the white girls and etc. and I mean etc.,\u201d wrote Waldo Pauls, scion of a Houston cotton merchant.\n\nMany alumni were horrified at integration efforts. \u201cI have had negroes around me all my life and still employ them in my office and in my home,\u201d Waldo Pauls, scion of a Houston cotton merchant and a UT alumnus, wrote to the UT president shortly after the sit-in. \u201cThey are like children and if given an inch they will take a mile. If you treat them as your equal they will want to date the white girls and etc. and I mean etc.\u201d Perhaps mindful of offending powerful donors, the university correspondence to racist alumni ranged from meek to obsequious. The UT president, Smiley, wrote Pauls that \u201call of us concerned feel that this is an extremely critical situation, and I assure you that we are doing our utmost to make the right decision.\u201d In November 1961, an East Texas attorney and UT law graduate, Billy Hunt, also wrote Smiley about a complaint he had received from a wealthy, elderly client whom he had encouraged to leave at least $10,000 of his estate to the University of Texas. The client had learned that a University of Texas law professor had circulated a petition calling for the end of segregated facilities on campus:\n\nToday, I was called upon by this gentleman to prepare another will which omitted this bequest. This was all brought about by the idiotic action of the faculty in general, and one of the professors of the law school, in particular, in pushing through some sort of resolution calling for the removal of segregation practices in regard to the restrooms in the dormitories. When the story appeared in the press, this client, who has rather strong feelings on the matter, came to my office and stated that he would leave no money to any institution which would harbor such people on its faculty. Frankly, I could not work up too much enthusiasm in trying to get him to change his mind.\n\nSmiley, the UT president, wrote to Hunt to say his letter \u201cobviously distresses me.\u201d \u201cIt is clear, of course, that we cannot afford to sustain the loss of any potential private support, for, as you know, this kind of support is indispensable our goal of achieving high academic excellence,\u201d Smiley said, explaining that the administration and board of regents \u201care doing our utmost to define and attain the wisest possible solution of these problems.\u201d\n\nInstead of backing down as the regents had demanded, the young women who\u2019d participated in the sit-in chose to file suit. A UT law professor who served as their counselor was deemed a traitor by the regents. The sit-in became a cause: When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited the campus in March 1962 to give a talk on segregation\u2014before an audience of 1,200 people on a campus that was less than 1 percent Black\u2014he announced that \u201cOld Man Segregation is on his deathbed. The only question is how expensive the South is going to make the funeral.\u201d And in May a national chemical engineering conference to be hosted by UT was suddenly put in jeopardy because one of the member associations had complained. \u201cUnfortunately there appears to be real danger that we will lose the conference if we do not act soon to correct a minor technicality in our dormitory regulations,\u201d an engineering dean wrote to Smiley, the university president. The \u201cminor technicality\u201d was that the dorms were segregated by race\u2014and one of the participating engineering societies from elsewhere in the country had raised an objection.\n\nThe segregation of the dorms had practical, nearly farcical consequences. A small note to the university president in the summer of 1962, at a time when white and Black housing remained segregated, reports that a pair of Black kids in Austin for a high school band conference at UT had found that their rooms lacked air conditioning. In mid-June, at the time of this conference, Austin broils. \u201cLiterature about the conference mentioned air-conditioned quarters,\u201d says the index card note. \u201cPresumably Nelson Patrick, who is in charge, had checked and all the students attending were supposed to be white.\u201d\n\nFacing pressure from the dorm integration lawsuit, UT Chancellor Harry Ransom told the student-plaintiffs to withdraw the suit in the spring of 1964, a few months before President Lyndon Johnson was due to give the university commencement address. Keen to end a legal showdown they were likely to lose and concerned about their relationship with Washington, university officials pledged to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d integrate the dorms on their own.\n\n\u201cThat was part of the reason why the University wanted to integrate as fast as possible,\u201d one of the plaintiffs, Sherryl Griffin, told the Daily Texan in 2016. \u201cSo that when the President of the United States came, the University would not still be involved in the punitive legacy of our lawsuit.\u201d\n\nUT also faced the real possibility, with the impending passage of the Civil Rights Act that year, that it would have to forfeit federal funding if it remained, on paper, segregated. Heath, an East Texas attorney who was an old friend of Johnson\u2019s and now chaired the board of regents, admitted that he \u201ccame on the board with a lot of prejudices\u201d and did not realize that \u201con federal research grants, you get cut off a lot of places if you\u2019re not integrated.\u201d The president, in other words, forced his hand. At its meeting on May 16, 1964, the board of regents ordered the full integration of the university. According to the self-congratulatory official minutes of the meeting, \u201cthe Board completed its task of \u2018integration with all deliberate speed\u2019 as promised, and without troops, marshals, violence or bloodshed.\u201d\n\nToday the University of Texas has sought to repair the historic wrongs. It has an Office for Inclusion and Equity, hosts an annual conference focused on issues facing Black student-athletes, and welcomes pioneering African American admits back for an annual reunion, and even finds itself under attack in the courts for its affirmative action policies. \u201cFor half of UT\u2019s 135 years, the university did not admit African American students,\u201d university president Gregory Fenves said in a 2018 speech. \u201cOur history of exclusion and segregation gives us a responsibility to stand as champions of the educational benefits of diversity.\u201d\n\nThe history of segregation at UT, as at other Southern universities, is not so ancient. On a beautiful mid-October evening in Austin, at halftime of a game against Kansas, members of the 1969 national championship football team gathered at midfield and held aloft their Hook \u2018Em Horns hand signs. Marking the 50th anniversary of that Longhorn campaign, the band struck up \u201cThe Eyes of Texas,\u201d and the crowd of more than 97,000 fans took to their feet in burnt-orange salute. It was a poignant moment: Here were aging athletes being regaled once more for their boyhood feats. But there was little or no official reckoning with a singular fact: that this group was the last all-white team to win the national championship. The first Black player didn\u2019t make the varsity team until 1970\u2014at least a half-dozen years after the regents had decided, on paper, to fully integrate the university and 16 years after Marion Ford had announced his desire to play ball.\n\nAsher Price is a staff reporter at the Austin American-Statesman.
