    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nFinally , \u201c While Trump \u2019 s \u2018 spy \u2019 comments were certainly shocking , in reality , they are actually not that far off from official justice department policy when dealing with whistleblowers who go to the press with classified information . For years , many of these brave people \u2013 who have exposed CIA torture , drone strikes , unprecedented cyber attacks and mass surveillance \u2013 have been prosecuted by administrations from both parties under the Espionage Act\u2026 It \u2019 s long past time that [ Congress ] passed robust whistleblower protections for all intelligence community members so they don \u2019 t have to constantly worry about retaliation or worse for exposing illegal or corrupt actions. \u201d Trevor Timm , The Guardian\nRegarding the Bidens , \u201c There are no indications that Hunter \u2019 s activities swayed any decision his father made as vice president . Joe Biden did pressure Ukraine \u2019 s fledgling post-Yanukovych president to remove a public prosecutor\u2014as part of concerted U.S. policy . So did every other Western government and dozens of Ukrainian and international pro-democracy activists . The problem was not that the prosecutor was too aggressive with corrupt businessman-politicians like Hunter Biden \u2019 s boss ; it was that he was too lenient\u2026 \u201c And Hunter Biden was hardly the only prominent American who did well for himself during Ukraine \u2019 s transition . Another Burisma director was Cofer Black , George W. Bush \u2019 s CIA counterterrorism chief . The Republican operative and future Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort worked for Yanukovych . So did Obama White House Counsel Gregory Craig\u2026 All too often , the scandal isn \u2019 t that the conduct in question is forbidden by federal law , but rather , how much scandalous conduct is perfectly legal \u2014and broadly accepted\u2026 Impeachment alone will not end our national calamity . If we want to help our country heal , we must start holding ourselves , our friends , and our allies\u2014and not just our enemies\u2014to its highest standards. \u201d Sarah Chayes , The Atlantic\n\u201c Trump has never recognized any distinction between his public and private life . Extraordinarily , he didn \u2019 t divest from his businesses even while serving as president . Even worse , he treated the government as if it were his property . The Ukraine scandal is another case of Trump treating the executive branch as though it had been acquired by the Trump Organization\u2026 \u201c [ Representative Mark Meadows ] observed in the president \u2019 s defense , \u2018 He didn \u2019 t see anything wrong with the conversation he had with a foreign leader. \u2019 That is probably accurate . Trump has a finely honed antenna for assessing winner versus loser , or loyal versus disloyal . But the formulation of moral concepts is not a function he can perform\u2026 No American president has more richly deserved impeachment. \u201d Jonathan Chait , New York Magazine\n\u201c As the whistleblower notes , the intent was to \u2018 lock down \u2019 evidence of the conversation . This move shows us that Trump 's closest advisers recognized quickly that the call posed a major problem and bucked normal protocol to try to hide it . Lawyers call this \u2018 consciousness of guilt \u2019 -- meaning that when people try to hide evidence or influence witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice , they typically do so for a reason . This kind of proof can be devastating in court \u2026 \u201c [ Moreover ] Giuliani 's involvement in Trump 's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump : why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all ? The answer , it seems , is that Trump 's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for ( or perhaps at the expense of ) the best interests of the United States. \u201d Elie Honig , CNN\n\u201c White House officials ordered information about President Trump \u2019 s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky to be removed from the classified server typically used to store such information and placed on a hyper-secure \u2018 code word \u2019 server . Such special protections are typically reserved for material of the gravest sensitivity : detailed information about covert operations , for example , where exposure can get people killed\u2026 It is difficult to overstate just how abnormal and suspicious treating the call in that manner would be . It strongly suggests White House staff knew of serious wrongdoing by the president and attempted to bury it \u2014 a profound abuse of classified systems for political , and possibly criminal , purposes. \u201d Kelly Magsamen , Washington Post\n\u201c What is striking is the tone of the whistleblower 's complaint : This is a savvy Washington bureaucrat . This person is quite familiar with the law as it applies to whistleblowers and savvy enough to have presented his/her complaint at an unclassified level ( with some classified material in an appendix ) so that when it publicly surfaced\u2026 the public could make its own judgments about the nature of the whistleblower 's complaints against President Trump and his enablers. \u201d Peter Bergen , CNN\nThe right is skeptical of the whistleblower complaint and impeachment in general , and argues that further investigation of Hunter Biden is warranted .\nThe right is skeptical of the whistleblower complaint and impeachment in general , and argues that further investigation of Hunter Biden is warranted .\n\u201c \u2018 I was not a direct witness to most of the events \u2019 characterized in the document , the complainant confesses on the first page . Instead , the complainant notes , the document is based on conversations with \u2018 more than half a dozen U.S. officials. \u2019 Those officials are not named , and their positions are not identified anywhere in the letter\u2026 A review of the entire complaint shows it is not so much an example of whistle-blowing , an act that can only be done by the individual holding the whistle , but an elaborate gossipy game of telephone between unnamed individuals whose motives and credibility are impossible to ascertain . \u201d\n\u201c Remember when Democrats insisted that President Trump was \u2018 working on behalf of the Russians , \u2019 only to have special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declare he \u2018 did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities \u2019 ? Well , we now have the rough transcript for Trump \u2019 s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and it \u2019 s clear that , once again , Democrats got ahead of the evidence\u2026 The reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used U.S. aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2026\n\u201c In the complaint , the whistleblower alleges that efforts by White House officials to \u2018 lock down \u2019 the transcript are evidence of presidential wrongdoing . Or maybe they are evidence officials did not want yet another presidential conversation to leak . No president in modern times has seen more of his conversations with foreign leaders leak than Trump , including calls with Australian then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte , British then-Prime Minister Theresa May , and Russian President Vladimir Putin . Little wonder the administration takes measures to restrict access to transcripts of those conversations . \u201d\n\u201c Long before the conversation came around to the Biden topic , the \u2018 favor \u2019 that Trump asked for was Zelensky \u2019 s assistance inBarr \u2019 s ongoing investigation of the genesis of the Trump-Russia investigation . No matter how much Democrats seek to discredit that probe and the AG overseeing it , it is a legitimate investigation conducted by the United States Department of Justice , which has prosecutors assigned and grand jury subpoena power\u2026\n\u201c It is a commonplace for the government to seek assistance from foreign counterparts for ongoing federal investigations\u2026 And the president is never conflicted out of executive branch business due to his political interests . There is no legal or ethical requirement that the Justice Department be denied potentially probative evidence because obtaining it might affect the president \u2019 s political fortunes . \u201d\n\u201c Were Trump to pass documents to his campaign , that would blend his official powers with his electioneering apparatus , which is against campaign-finance law . Were Trump to tell Zelensky to leak whatever damaging information he might find about Biden , that too would constitute election interference . Obviously , if Trump asked Zelensky to target Biden or his campaign with hacking , it would be a crime . If he asked Zelensky to fabricate information and leak it to the public , this impeachment talk would be completely justified . Yet Trump did not do these things . He asked for information that might help him serve the national interest in his capacity as president . \u201d\n\u201c If Trump is impeached , he will follow the precedent set by Bill Clinton and ignore calls to resign . Then he \u2019 ll follow the second precedent set by Clinton and win in the Senate , which will set up the third precedent , a claim that his tormentors wasted the people \u2019 s time and money . Clinton \u2019 s approval rating rose by double digits as the process played out and Americans decided he was being needlessly put through a wringer . The lesson we all should have learned is : If you can \u2019 t make your impeachment bipartisan , don \u2019 t bother . \u201d\nMany argue that \u201c whatever one may think of President Trump 's actions on Ukraine , it should not preclude the media from pressing Joe Biden on the shady dealings that his son Hunter had while Biden was vice president\u2026 There 's simply no plausible explanation as to why Hunter , despite a lack of energy experience and a recent discharge from the U.S . Naval Reserve after a positive cocaine test , would be put on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma and paid up to $ 50,000 a month other than the fact that his father was vice president at the time and the company was hoping to curry favor and bolster its prestige\u2026\n\u201c There are plenty of important lines of inquiry for Biden . For instance : Was he aware of Hunter 's deal ? Did he think it was OK ? Did he raise any concerns within the Obama administration about potential conflicts of interest , especially if he was being made the messenger on Ukraine policy ? \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame .
