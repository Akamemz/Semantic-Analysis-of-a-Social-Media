    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives voted to change the way doctors are paid for treating Medicare patients , giving Speaker John Boehner a second legislative victory following weeks of discord in his Republican caucus.Lawmakers in both parties hailed the 392-37 vote as a breakthrough for a chamber often depicted as dysfunctional. \u201c I hope this bipartisan approach is contagious , \u201d said Democratic Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts on the House floor.The vote , along with Wednesday \u2019 s adoption by the House of its version of a fiscal 2016 budget , reflects a quick turnaround for Boehner from earlier disputes among Republicans that caused a near-shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security and forced some bills to be pulled for lack of support.Unlike the budget measure , which was adopted solely with Republican support , the Medicare bill also represented the work of top Democrats , led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.The bill , H.R . 2 , would replace Medicare \u2019 s cost-containment formula for physician payments in place since 1997 . Congress has listened to warnings that physicians might stop taking Medicare patients and voted 17 times to prevent the formula from forcing cuts in doctor fees . The existing formula would cut doctors \u2019 pay by 21 percent starting April 1.The American Medical Association , the largest U.S. doctors \u2019 organization , has been lobbying for years to change the payment system.Children \u2019 s InsuranceThe measure also would include a two-year extension of the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program past its current Sept. 30 expiration.Representative Michael Burgess , a Texas Republican and a doctor , said on the House floor that the plan is the result of \u201c careful , intricate , bipartisan negotiations. \u201d \u201c We coalesced against the constant threat of payment cuts , \u201d Burgess said , that \u201c everyone agrees has got to go. \u201d McGovern said , \u201c This bill is not perfect .
