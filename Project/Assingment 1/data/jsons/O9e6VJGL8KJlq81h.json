    "content": "Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the country Thursday night in Tampa , delivering a deeply personal nomination acceptance address that balanced pledges to fix the economy and critiques of President Obama with stories about his own life and where he comes from .\nThe Republican presidential nominee made a clear effort on the closing night of the GOP national convention to let voters know a little more about Romney the man -- not just Romney the businessman or former governor . He flashed his humorous side , at one moment an emotional side , as he told the story of his parents , his children , his wife and his early days in business .\nAnd before the balloons and confetti rained down , he drew the address back to the message that has driven his campaign : Obama has not lived up to the lofty promise of his 2008 run , he said , and does not have what it takes to fix the economy .\n\u201c What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound . It does n't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs , \u201d Romney said . \u201c What America needs is jobs . Lots of jobs . \u201d\nRomney called on voters to put the \u201c disappointment \u201d and the \u201c divisiveness \u201d of the last four years behind them , and \u201c turn the page \u201d with him .\n\u201c This president can ask us to be patient .
