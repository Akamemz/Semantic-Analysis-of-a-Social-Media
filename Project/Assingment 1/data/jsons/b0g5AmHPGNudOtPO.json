    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s latest self-inflicted trauma \u2014 an 11-year-old recording on which he can be heard recalling his unwanted advances on a married woman and boasting that his celebrity allows him to get away with sexual assault \u2014 should not be remembered as the reason he lost this presidential race . It could fairly be considered the nail in his campaign \u2019 s coffin , but let the record show that on October 7 , 2016 , Trump was already well on his way to electoral defeat , trailing by 3.2 points in the RealClearPolitics national average ; by 2.4 points in Florida ; by 2.6 points in North Carolina ; and by 6 points in Pennsylvania . He also is vastly out-organized in each of those three must-win states .\nNor should this October surprise be looked back upon as the episode that triggered a fatal decrease in Trump \u2019 s support among women voters . Here again , Trump \u2019 s fate was likely already sealed , thanks to an inept first debate performance followed by a six-day stretch in which the nominee ceaselessly ridiculed and shamed a former Miss Universe contestant , Alicia Machado , for no apparent reason other than to settle a personal grudge . A national Quinnipiac poll released on the day of that first debate , September 26 , showed Trump down just five points among women . On October 7 , having conducted a new national survey in the wake of those events , Quinnipiac released its findings : Trump was down 20 points among women . ( This 15-point drop among female voters , in a period of less than two weeks , is also reflected in battleground state polling . )\nNo , what will prove most memorable from this incident \u2014 and potentially , most damaging in the long term \u2014 is how the party stood by Trump despite concrete evidence of extreme lewdness from its nominee .\n\u201c I moved on her , and I failed . \u2026 I did try and f * * * her . She was married , \u201d Trump says in the recording from 2005 , which was taken aboard the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d bus and obtained by the Washington Post . Trump continues to discuss the woman in question , \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d host Nancy O \u2019 Dell , claiming she enhanced her breasts . Then , when Trump and a fellow passenger spotted a woman outside , Trump says , \u201c I \u2019 ve got to use some Tic Tacs , just in case I start kissing her . You know I \u2019 m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them . It \u2019 s like a magnet . Just kiss . I don \u2019 t even wait. \u201d Moments later , Trump adds , \u201c And when you \u2019 re a star , they let you do it . You can do anything . \u2026 Grab them by the p * * * y . You can do anything . \u201d\nThis talk isn \u2019 t terribly surprising . Trump has a long , well-documented history of making crude comments about women , and he has been the subject of numerous lawsuits and news stories resulting from allegations of unwanted sexual conduct . But the newly released recording was jarring for its immediacy . After it went viral on Friday afternoon , GOP leaders scrambled to organize their responses .\nSpeaker Paul Ryan , the highest ranking Republican in the country , took considerable time in releasing a statement due to conversations with the Trump campaign about an event that was scheduled in Wisconsin for Saturday . Ryan , in his statement , said he was \u201c sickened \u201d by Trump \u2019 s remarks , adding : \u201c Women are to be championed and revered , not objectified . I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. \u201d Ryan also announced that Trump wouldn \u2019 t be coming to Wisconsin , where the two were set to make their first joint appearance on the campaign trail . But the speaker \u2014 who felt compelled to endorse Trump despite their many differences , and has stuck by him through countless controversies \u2014 showed no sign of rescinding his endorsement .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a similarly terse statement . \u201c These comments are repugnant , and unacceptable in any circumstance , \u201d he said . \u201c As the father of three daughters , I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere , and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape. \u201d Like Ryan , however , McConnell gave no suggestion of withdrawing his support for Trump .\nRepublican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus offered his own brief rebuke : \u201c No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner . Ever. \u201d And yet there is no question the party chairman will continue to back Trump \u2014 in fact , a statement from the nominee \u2019 s campaign late Friday night said Priebus would be joining him in New York on Saturday for debate prep .\nIt \u2019 s not just the party leadership in Washington that \u2019 s showing no appetite for taking on Trump . A whole host of Republican senators , including nearly all of those facing reelection next month , issued statements Friday night expressing outrage at the nominee \u2019 s remarks . They came from : Arizona \u2019 s John McCain ; North Carolina \u2019 s Richard Burr ; Pennsylvania \u2019 s Pat Toomey ; New Hampshire \u2019 s Kelly Ayotte ; and Ohio \u2019 s Rob Portman , among others . But not one of these senators announced any kind of opposition to Trump \u2014 whether by withdrawing their support or by calling on him to step down as the nominee .\nA few Republicans , in fairness , did just that . Illinois Senator Mark Kirk , who \u2019 s facing certain defeat next month , tweeted : \u201c . @ realDonaldTrump should drop out . @ GOP should engage rules for emergency replacement. \u201d Utah Governor Gary Herbert tweeted : \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s statements are beyond offensive & despicable . While I can not vote for Hillary Clinton , I will not vote for Trump. \u201d Utah Senator Mike Lee posted a video calling on Trump to drop out . Another Utah Republican , House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz , withdrew his support for Trump . And two House Republicans \u2014 Mike Coffman of Colorado and Barbara Comstock of Virginia \u2014 called on Trump to step down as the Republican nominee .\nHowever , this can hardly be considered a show of force . There are 246 House Republicans , 54 Senate Republicans , and 31 Republican governors . The small handful who announced their opposition to Trump on Friday , on top of the few who already had , amounts to a tiny fraction of the party \u2019 s national leadership .\nWhere this will prove stubbornly problematic for the GOP is in its efforts to distance itself from Trump on November 9 , over the ensuing four years , and perhaps much longer . In Congress and on the campaign trail , Republicans will attempt to turn the page on an ugly chapter in their party \u2019 s history , and they will do so by arguing that they had nothing to do with Trump \u2019 s ascent . They will claim that he was never their first choice , that he wasn \u2019 t a conservative , and that they only supported him because it was a binary choice between him and Hillary Clinton . But it won \u2019 t be an easy pitch , given how many of them have been on record excusing and enabling his behavior \u2014 and how many more have refused obvious opportunities to abandon ship , including the tape incident of October 7 .\nThese tea-party inspired lawmakers have waged war on their own party \u2019 s leadership in the name of ideological purity and even forced Speaker John Boehner from office . But history will count them among Trump \u2019 s most loyal supporters . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported in August , even though only one of the group \u2019 s 39 members endorsed Trump during the primary , 38 of 39 were supportive once he became the de facto nominee \u2014 and none of them advocated for his ouster at the convention in Cleveland . Messages to several of the group \u2019 s leaders Friday night asking if they still support Trump went unreturned ; the only member who responded , Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina , replied , \u201c Yes . \u201d\nThe Freedom Caucus already has a target on its back in Washington . By distancing themselves from Trump early and unequivocally , members could have made good on their rhetoric of putting principle ahead of party \u2014 and as a consequence , enjoyed greater credibility ( and goodwill ) within the House Republican conference come January 2017 . Instead , they \u2019 ll face the same criticisms being leveled at the broader GOP .\nTed Cruz withheld his endorsement of Trump in Cleveland and was booed off stage for it , but he and most of his advisers believed the decision would be validated both by Trump \u2019 s predictable onslaught of provocations and by his eventual loss to Clinton . Had Cruz stuck by his original decision , he would look like the smartest man in the Republican party right now \u2014 someone principled ( and prescient ) enough to go against the grain in refusing to support Trump . Instead , Cruz gave into pressure and announced his support for his former rival in late September , just in time for the nominee \u2019 s campaign to implode . Cruz is going to have a difficult time explaining all of this come 2020 , having angered both the pragmatic conservatives who demanded an endorsement in Cleveland and the purists who shuddered when he eventually caved and offered it .\nMarco Rubio \u2019 s predicament is every bit as complex \u2014 and even more urgent . Having once called Trump a \u201c con artist \u201d who can \u2019 t be trusted with the nuclear codes , the Florida senator wound up walking back his criticisms after quitting the race . He eventually announced his support for Trump , and even taped a video message that was played at the convention . Rubio \u2019 s problem isn \u2019 t just that he \u2019 ll have to explain these contradictions if he runs in 2020 ; it \u2019 s that he \u2019 s running for reelection right now in a competitive battleground state . Polls have shown Rubio with a comfortable lead , but Trump \u2019 s latest controversy is likely to do serious damage down-ballot . To win his Senate race , Rubio needs ticket-splitters \u2014 and to get them , he \u2019 ll need to begin distancing himself from Trump immediately . His tweet Friday night \u2014 \u201c Donald \u2019 s comments were vulgar , egregious & impossible to justify . No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms , even in private. \u201d \u2014 is a start , but Rubio might soon feel the need to untether himself from Trump entirely .\nMike Pence might be in the biggest bind of all . On the one hand , Trump \u2019 s running mate turned in a widely-praised debate performance this week and showed himself to be an attractive spokesman for the party . On the other hand , well , he \u2019 s Trump \u2019 s running mate . Cruz and Rubio and anyone else angling ahead of 2020 has the realistic option of cutting bait ; Pence does not . It \u2019 s an impossible position for the Indiana governor . He \u2019 s known as an old school , consummate gentleman \u2014 Pence wouldn \u2019 t let female staffers work late in his office on Capitol Hill to avoid even the appearance of impropriety \u2014 and is surely steaming at Trump \u2019 s recorded remarks . But at the same time , Pence has shown no willingness to buck the top of the ticket . Should he decide to take his own shot in 2020 , this puts him in an extraordinarily difficult position , especially because some conservatives believe that his decision to partner with Trump renders him ineligible for their consideration in the first place .\nThere \u2019 s one Republican who \u2019 s a virtual lock to run for president in 2020 and who \u2019 s never supported Trump : John Kasich . He issued his own rebuke via Twitter on Friday night : \u201c Make no mistake the comments were wrong and offensive . They are indefensible. \u201d The Ohio governor has been so adamant in his opposition to Trump that he boycotted the party \u2019 s convention in his own backyard . That rubbed many Republicans the wrong way , but Trump \u2019 s collapse could certainly vindicate him \u2014 and , in the eyes of the party \u2019 s upscale , college-educated wing , it could make him the early favorite to face off against Clinton four years from now .\nMore than any individual politician , it \u2019 s the Republican party that stands to suffer most from Trump \u2019 s controversies after he leaves the campaign trail . It \u2019 s one thing to lose an election and cede control of the White House to the opposition party for four more years ; it \u2019 s another for the GOP to be branded as the Party of Trump . Republicans across the spectrum have spent the past six months assuring themselves that it won \u2019 t happen , that it can \u2019 t happen , that parties take on the personality of their nominees every four years and that Trump will be remembered as an aberration and nothing more .\nPerhaps . But after a campaign in which the GOP nominee gave unprecedented offense \u2014 calling Mexicans \u201c rapists , \u201d ridiculing John McCain for being captured , mocking a disabled reporter , proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants , launching racist attacks on a federal judge , feuding with a Gold Star family , and now , having \u201c Grab them by the p * * * y \u201d played on TV ads \u2014 it \u2019 s unlikely that Democrats will be letting go anytime soon . And Republicans who continue to stand by Trump aren \u2019 t giving them reason to . One month from Election Day , it seems likely that Trump \u2019 s lasting legacy \u2014 in addition to losing \u2014 will be saddling the GOP with baggage for years to come .",
