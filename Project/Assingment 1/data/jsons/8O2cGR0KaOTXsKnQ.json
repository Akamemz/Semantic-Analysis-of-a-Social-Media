    "content": "The question that mattered most at the Democrats \u2019 first presidential primary debate was the question that none of the assembled candidates had a good answer for : What will you do about Mitch McConnell ?\nThe Democrats onstage in Miami on Wednesday night had plans for everything . It was a festival of policy proposals on immigration and gun control , health care and climate change . But even if one of those candidates wins in 2020 , if McConnell remains Senate majority leader , their agenda is as good as dead .\nNo one wants to admit that , of course . \u201c Short of a Democratic majority , you better understand the fight still goes on , \u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren . \u201c It starts in the White House and it means that everyone we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come January 2021 . \u201d\n\u201c As my colleagues know , I fought from the day I got to the Senate and built coalitions and passed the First Step Act , \u201d said Sen. Cory Booker . \u201c Not as far as I want to go , but thousands of people will be liberated . \u201d\nThese are wan answers to a very plausible scenario . The likeliest 2020 outcome is that Democrats win the White House and Republicans hold the Senate . To take back the gavel , Democrats would need to defend a tough seat in Alabama and win three seats above that . Their best chances are races in Arizona , Colorado , and perhaps Maine . Beyond that , Iowa and North Carolina are possible , but unlikely , targets . It \u2019 s not an impossible path back to the majority , but it \u2019 s not an easy one , either .\nMaking matters worse for Democrats , this may be their last chance to retake the Senate for the foreseeable future . The 2022 election is a tougher map for them , and it \u2019 ll be a midterm year . If they win the White House in 2020 , they \u2019 re likely to lose Senate seats in 2022 \u2014 and that \u2019 s even truer if their agenda has been stymied by a Republican Senate and the country deems their presidency a failure . It \u2019 s 2020 or bust .\nIn a more sensible system , the presidential candidates would be quizzed on how they would lead their party to down-ballot victory if nominated . They \u2019 d release detailed plans for organizing in purple states and crafting a message designed to carry coattails . They \u2019 d be discussing statehood for Puerto Rico and DC \u2014 which is the right thing to do on the merits and would also strengthen Democrats \u2019 Senate competitiveness in the future . It \u2019 d be all hands on deck to take back the Senate .\nThe reality is closer to the opposite . Part of Democrats \u2019 Senate problem was evident onstage . Democrats would have a better chance in Texas if Beto O \u2019 Rourke or Juli\u00e1n Castro had chosen to take on Sen. John Cornyn . Thursday \u2019 s presidential debate will feature John Hickenlooper , the strongest candidate Democrats could have fielded in Colorado . Steve Bullock , the only Democrat with a shot in Montana , didn \u2019 t qualify for the debates , but he \u2019 s still running for president rather than Senate . Stacey Abrams passed on the race in Georgia . Some of these candidates could drop out and file for Senate , but running back to your state after flaming out nationally isn \u2019 t the strongest way to start a tough campaign .\nAt the same time , the presidential campaign is pushing Democrats far to the left on everything from health care to immigration to abortion to climate change . The pressure in the Democratic Party to decriminalize border crossing isn \u2019 t going to make it easier to win Senate seats in Texas or Arizona ; the effort to enshrine Roe v.

My point here isn \u2019 t that Democrats are wrong for taking stronger stands on these issues , but the Senate map forces them to win in center-right ( and even far-right ) states , and that gets harder as the national party pulls left on divisive issues .\nPerhaps that \u2019 s an outdated view of the electorate .
