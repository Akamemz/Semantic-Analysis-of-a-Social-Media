    "content": "The race for Ohio is slowly tightening , but Mitt Romney does not hold a lead in a single poll in the current Real Clear Politics average ( he is tied in two ) . Two polls from Time and CBS/Quinnipiac have grabbed headlines by showing Obama a five-point lead in each . Romney is chipping away at Obama \u2019 s poll lead , but the Democratic advantage in party-ID has increased across these polls . When looking at the polls in Ohio , it is becoming entirely possible that Mitt Romney should be able to win Ohio without ever showing a consistent lead in the polls , or any lead at all .\nIn the past week Romney has trimmed four-tenths of a point off of his deficit in the RCP average , going from 2.5 to 2.1 , but at the same time , the average party-ID advantage for Democrats in these polls has risen from 5.5 to 6.5 . A big reason for the increase in Democrats \u2019 share in the polls is due to early voting . If a pollster calls someone who says they voted already , they are automatically passed through the likely-voter screen since they have , after all , voted . The problem with this can be best summed up by Gregory House : \u201c Everybody lies . \u201d\nPollsters can only work with what their respondents tell them , and this is the reason that likely-voter screens can be so tricky , though important , in polling . The preferable response is that you are going to vote or , in the case of Ohio , that you \u2019 ve already voted . Many respondents will say they are going to vote ( or have voted ) when in fact they may not end up doing it ( this effect is known as social-desirability bias ) . For this reason , some likely-voter screens ask about previous elections and general political enthusiasm to gauge the actual likelihood that a voter will end up in the booth on Election Day . But that is where early voting throws the screen out the window \u2014 if a voter says they voted , there is nothing a pollster can do to but assume that it \u2019 s true .\nEnter Ohio , where the current estimates from compiling early in-person and absentee voting shows early turnout to be about 15 percent of voters . But responses in the current polls claim that 23 percent of registered voters have already voted . That means that polls are overstating early voting by eight percentage points on average . This could be in part because some voters have requested an absentee ballot and report that as voting , some have mailed in ballots that haven \u2019 t been counted as received yet , but some voters are also just flat out saying they voted when they haven \u2019 t . It \u2019 s impossible to know the exact reason , but it \u2019 s clear that more are claiming to vote than really have .\nIn the polls \u2019 early-voting results , Obama leads on average by 20 points . There are indications that the GOP has shrunk the Democratic advantage in this category significantly from 2008 , but it is unclear how much . Either way , Obama \u2019 s early-voting advantage gives him a lead that Romney is only scraping away at with his Election Day voter lead . But if pollsters are finding more respondents who are claiming to have already voted than what the records show , some of this early-voter advantage is illusory .\nThis is why it is increasingly difficult for Romney to show an lead in the Ohio polls . But even with Obama currently enjoying a 2.1 point lead , Romney is still in great shape to win Ohio on Election Day . Here are some of the reasons for the optimism coming from Boston these days :\nRomney \u2019 s strength with independents keeps growing : Last week when Obama led the Real Clear Politics average by 2.5 points , Romney led among independents by an average of 8.7 points . Romney has since increased that lead with independents to 12.3 points , which is why he \u2019 s been able to cut Obama \u2019 s overall lead even as the polls have leaned more Democratic . In 2008 Obama beat McCain with independents by eight points . It would be almost impossible for Obama to win Ohio while suffering a 20-point swing among independents .\nThe polls give Democrats a better turnout advantage than they had in 2008 : As I explained in my last Ohio post , in 2008 Democrats beat Republicans in turnout by five points . The current polls show an average of D+6.6 . A D+5 turnout in 2008 gave Obama a 4.5-point victory , while he is currently leading by only 2.1 points on an even greater D+6.6 turnout . Again , we know it should be very difficult for Democrats to match their 2008 turnout , let alone increase it .\nHistory suggests late deciders will break against the incumbent : This is a rule that always receives some skepticism , but it \u2019 s very likely to benefit Romney at least some on Election Day . In 2004 , late deciders broke against George W. Bush heavily , even though he was a wartime president . John Kerry beat Bush by 25 points among voters who decided in the last month , 28 points among voters that decided in the three days prior to Election Day , and 22 points among day-of deciders . Those voters were 20 percent of the Ohio electorate ; while this year there are expected to be fewer late deciders , Obama can not afford to lose among by those margins and still win .\nIn Ohio , Republicans tend to outperform their share of the national vote : In the last nine elections , the GOP has outperformed in Ohio . With Romney currently running just ahead of Obama nationally , it seems much more likely that Obama \u2019 s lead in Ohio has more to do with the higher party-ID advantage than a dramatic shift in Ohio from the past nine elections .\nStrength with crossover voters in Ohio : In addition to Romney \u2019 s strength with independents , in the past two elections the GOP candidate has won over more Democrat votes than he \u2019 s lost Republican ones . Obama \u2019 s Ohio win in 2008 was based entirely on his strength with independents and the wave turnout , both of which are highly unlikely to be repeated in 2012 . If Romney wins with independents by anywhere near the current average he has and takes more crossover voters than Obama does , Obama would need to exceed 2008 turnout greatly to win .\nSo , with less than two weeks until Election Day we will all know the results soon enough , but as more Ohio polls come in , it is important to remember that the picture for Romney in Ohio is better than many pundits would have us believe . It only takes a quick look at Romney \u2019 s rallies to remind us it \u2019 s not 2008 anymore , as Republicans have reclaimed the enthusiasm advantage that led to such sweeping 2008 victories for Democrats . That GOP enthusiasm has become contagious since the debates , and it is exactly what has Team Obama so afraid these days . All they have left to hang their hopes on is a slim lead in the polls , and even that might not be enough on Election Day .\n\u2014 Josh Jordan is a small-business market-research consultant .
