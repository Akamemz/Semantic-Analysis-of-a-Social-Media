Scott Walker , a Republican , said in 2011 as he signed a law imposing this new mandate . `` There really is no barrier for people , '' he asserted . `` Particularly in a society where people need photo identification for just about everything else , including checking out a book from the library \u2026 it 's a reasonable requirement .

They also tend to believe that anyone who lacks something so basic deserves no accommodation .\nThese attitudes reflect a failure to understand the lives of many Americans . In the suit challenging the Wisconsin law , which recently was overturned by a federal court , a parade of people attested that they lacked the required ID and , in many cases , could n't easily get it .\nOne of them was Ruthelle Frank , a former member of the village board of Brokaw .
