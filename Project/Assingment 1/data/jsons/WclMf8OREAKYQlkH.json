''\nIn an in interview with The Associated Press , the president told the Associated Press that `` we are n't where we need to be , '' as far as the economic recovery goes , but said his opponent 's ideas offer `` no prospect for long-term opportunity '' for Americans striving to enter the middle class .\n`` If they saw Governor Romney offering serious proposals that offered some sort of concrete ways in which middle-class families would be helped , then I could understand them thinking about that choice , '' Obama told the AP . `` But that 's not what 's happening . ''\nIn a wide-ranging interview , the president sought to align Romney with the `` extreme positions '' of House Republicans .\n`` I ca n't speak to Governor Romney 's motivations , '' Obama said . `` What I can say is that he has signed up for positions , extreme positions , that are very consistent with positions that a number of House Republicans have taken . And whether he actually believes in those or not , I have no doubt that he would carry forward some of the things that he 's talked about . ''\nAmong those `` extreme positions , '' Obama said , was that Romney `` would not stand in the way '' if Congress presented him with the items in the GOP party platform that would `` entirely roll back women 's control over their reproductive health . ''\nRepublican leaders adopted a party platform that opposes abortion but does not specifically mention cases of rape or incest as possible exceptions . The issue of abortion was at the forefront of the debate this week after Rep. Todd Akin , a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri , said that pregnancy is `` rare '' in cases of `` legitimate rape '' because the `` female body has a way to try to shut that whole thing down . ''\nRomney has said that his administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape .\nLooking ahead to the presidential debates , Obama complimented Romney as a `` capable debater '' but said his arguments are based on false accusations .\n`` The challenge he may end up having is the fact that some of the core arguments he 's making against me just are n't based on facts , '' he said .\nOn the stump and on the airwaves , Romney has been accusing the president of gutting welfare reform by dropping the work requirement , something the Obama campaign has said is `` blatantly false . ''\n`` If that 's the central premise or the central argument that you 're making and it 's based on something that 's just not true , it will be , I think , a little bit tougher to defend face-to-face in a debate , '' Obama said .\nIn response to the interview , the Romney campaign said `` the American people know they are n't better off than they were four years ago . ''\n`` Too many middle-class families are going to sleep each night worried about the future . This may be the best President Obama can do , but it 's not the best America can do . The Romney-Ryan plan for a stronger middle class will jump start our economy and create 12 million new jobs - and most importantly , give Americans hope for a better future , '' a Romney spokesman said in a written statement .",
