You said that , on occasion , America had dictated to other nations . Mr. President , America has not dictated to other nations . We have freed other nations from dictators , \u201d Mr. Romney said .\nBut the president called the claim that he \u2019 s apologized \u201c probably the biggest whopper that \u2019 s been told during the course of this campaign . \u201d\nMr. Obama led off the debate by defending his decision-making concerning Libya , where a terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi left four Americans dead , including the U.S. ambassador .\nBut that issue produced none of the fireworks from last week \u2019 s debate .\nInstead , the president turned his fire on Mr. Romney , questioning what his foreign policy really is .\n\u201c Your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map , \u201d Mr. Obama said , adding that just a few months ago , when asked what the biggest international threat was for the U.S. , Mr. Romney said it was Russia , not al Qaeda .\n\u201c The 1980s are now calling and asking for their foreign policy back , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nMr. Obama repeatedly tried to push his incumbent \u2019 s advantage , at one point ridiculing Mr. Romney \u2019 s claim that the U.S. has fewer ships than at any time since World War II .\n\u201c We also have fewer horses and bayonets , \u201d the president said . \u201c The question is not a game of Battleship where we \u2019 re counting ships ; it \u2019 s what are our capabilities . \u201d\nAs the challenger , Mr. Romney spent a good deal of time demonstrating he \u2019 d studied his briefs , as he pointed to al Qaeda activity in Mali and recited the approximate number of nuclear warheads Pakistan has assembled .\nAnd both men tried to turn the conversation to domestic issues , which they believe are more salient in voters \u2019 minds than foreign policy right now , saying that the U.S. \u2019 s world leadership depends on a strong economy here at home .\nAt one point Mr. Obama , saying that education had been neglected in the two domestic debates , began to talk about education , highlighting his plan to hire math and science teachers .\n\u201c Let me get back to foreign policy , \u201d moderator Bob Schieffer pleaded at one point \u2014 before acceding to Mr. Romney \u2019 s demand that he be allowed to highlight his own education record .\nOn Syria , while both men proclaimed to have differences , they laid out a similar policy of trying to help allies in the region , such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia , and of trying to get weapons to the right kinds of regime opponents .\n\u201c The Saudis and the Qatari and the Turks are all very concerned about this . They \u2019 re willing to work with us . We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria , making sure that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties , \u201d the Republican said .\n\u201c What you just heard Governor Romney say is he doesn \u2019 t have different ideas , and that \u2019 s because we \u2019 re doing exactly what we should be doing , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nAfter two foreign policy elections in 2004 and 2008 , global affairs have shifted to the back burner for much of this year \u2019 s campaign as the sluggish economy has dominated . But recent events in the Middle East \u2014 including the terrorist assault on the consulate in Benghazi \u2014 have raised its salience .\nVoters have generally given Mr. Obama higher marks on foreign policy , though Mr. Romney does better when the question is narrowed to national security .\nThe two men entered the debate with polls showing a close race .
