But what was surprising to some Wednesday was the sense that someone was finally doing something about them .\nThe U.S. Justice Department unsealed a 47-count indictment in federal court in Brooklyn that detailed charges against 14 people accused of racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy .\nThe most serious are the racketeering charges , which allege that the officials turned soccer `` into a criminal enterprise , '' according to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who spoke to reporters in New York . A conviction could command a sentence of up to 20 years .\n`` The idea of being shocked about bribery and racketeering at FIFA is like being shocked about jumping into a pool and finding yourself wet , '' said Dave Zirin , sports editor at The Nation magazine .\n`` What makes this particularly different is the fact that this time it looks like the charges have real teeth . I mean , coming from the U.S. Department of Justice , that 's a first . That 's never happened before , '' he said .\nThe complexity of the investigation Lynch described was evident by the federal officials accompanying her , including an assistant U.S. attorney , FBI Director James Comey and Richard Weber , head of the IRS criminal investigation division .\n`` This really is the World Cup of fraud , and today we are issuing FIFA a red card , '' Weber said .\nFIFA officials are accused of taking bribes totaling more than $ 150 million and in return providing `` lucrative media and marketing rights '' to soccer tournaments as kickbacks over the past 24 years .\n`` The defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world , '' Comey said in a statement . `` Undisclosed and illegal payments , kickbacks and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA . ''\nThe indictment `` is the beginning of our work , not the end '' of an effort to rid global soccer of corruption , said Kelly Currie , acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York .\nAfter the news conference , Chris Eaton , former FIFA head of security , said that U.S. officials have done `` something that no other police organization or other region has done so far on FIFA . ''\n`` The fact is there 's been no jurisdiction that was able to take a report , or to take action , or to coordinate a global action such as the U.S. has done today , '' he said . `` We 're seeing for the first time a very powerful jurisdiction take action against a very powerful , opaque organization . ''\nStan Collymore , a former member of England 's national team , said it 's a good thing Washington got involved in FIFA 's business .

Spokesman Dominic Chimhavi added , `` Those individuals that brought the World Cup to South Africa were men of high integrity . Men like the late President Nelson Mandela and our former President Thabo Mbeki . The bidding process was never compromised .

Though Lynch cited seven arrests , the Swiss office 's statement mentioned only six .\nIn Argentina , the process for the extradition of three defendants named in the U.S. indictment has begun , according to the country 's state-run news agency Telam . A federal judge has received a detention order from the U.S. Embassy for the Argentine citizens Alejandro Burzaco , Hugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis , the agency reported .\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter is not one of those arrested or facing charges by U.S. authorities , but he was among those investigated\nAsked if the U.S. investigation had cleared Blatter , Lynch told reporters , `` I 'm not able to comment further on Mr. Blatter 's status . '' Officials said earlier Wednesday that the investigation into Blatter 's possible involvement continues .\nBlatter said in a statement that FIFA welcomes the investigations by U.S. and Swiss authorities , and he believes their inquiries `` will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football . '' In fact , he said , the Swiss investigation was `` set in motion '' when FIFA submitted a dossier to authorities last year . He did not elaborate .\n`` Such misconduct has no place in football , and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game , '' Blatter said . `` We will continue to work with the relevant authorities and we will work vigorously within FIFA in order to root out any misconduct , to regain your trust and ensure that football worldwide is free from wrongdoing . ''\nFIFA spokesman Walter De Gregorio said the specter of scandal wo n't stop executives from soccer 's scandal-plagued governing body from gathering Friday to possibly elect Blatter to a fifth term , despite questions raised by Greg Dyke , the head of Britain 's Football Association , in light of Wednesday 's developments .\nHowever , European football 's governing body , UEFA , said its member associations should consider whether to attend the upcoming FIFA World Congress , which it said should be postponed . UEFA further called for `` new FIFA presidential elections to be organized within the next six months .

Leadership that restores confidence in the hundreds of millions of football fans around the world . ''\nDe Gregorio scarcely mentioned the U.S. indictment at his news conference , though he did put a positive spin on the Swiss investigation .\n`` This for FIFA is good , '' he said . `` It is not good in terms of image , and it 's not good in terms of reputation , but in terms of cleaning up , in terms of everything that we did in the last four years .
