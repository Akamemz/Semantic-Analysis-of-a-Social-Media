    "content": "More than 27 years before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States , Bruce Nobles , then the president of the Trump Shuttle airline , assessed with some befuddlement the business and managerial practices of his boss . Nobles had climbed a conventional corporate ladder at American , Continental and Pan Am , companies with org charts any MBA would recognize . The Trump Organization , on the other hand , was smaller , looser and much more freewheeling , and working for Trump , Nobles discovered , was a markedly different experience .\n\u201c It surprised me how much of a family-type operation it was , instead of a business kind of orientation where there is a structure and there is a chain of command and there is delegation of authority and responsibility , \u201d Nobles told a reporter from Newsday in the fall of 1989 . \u201c As the organization gets bigger , and it seems to be getting bigger all the time , he \u2019 ll have to do a better job of actually managing the place as opposed to making deals . \u201d\nMere months into Trump \u2019 s time as the owner of an airline\u2014the purchase was finalized that June\u2014Nobles already had concerns . Trump had overpaid with more than $ 400 million of borrowed money , he seemed most interested in cosmetic touches like the size of the \u201c T \u201d on the tails of the planes , and the debt service quickly became crippling . Once , Trump suggested cutting costs by flying with two pilots , not three , and Nobles had to tell him that would be illegal .\nTrump \u2019 s appetite was greater than his ability to manage what he had acquired . Last week on the phone , as Trump passed the one-month mark in the White House and prepared for tonight \u2019 s speech before a joint session of Congress , Nobles told me that what he sees now is what he saw then . \u201c His behavior to date , \u201d he said , \u201c is consistent with the behavior I saw 30 years ago . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s company , despite his grandiose portrayals of a sprawling empire , always at base was a mom-and-pop entity , and what Trump managed throughout his lengthy professional career was principally a core group of barely more than a dozen executives housed on the 26th floor of Trump Tower . Until now . As president , Trump sits at the top of a massive bureaucracy not of his own making , a complex hierarchy designed to help him handle the most information-intensive , crisis-driven job in the world . He appears to be struggling to adapt . Hundreds of positions remain vacant , key posts have been declined by wary nominees , poorly vetted picks have withdrawn or been rejected , and the day-to-day functioning of the West Wing has become its own running news story . Trump has dismissed the accounts of turmoil as \u201c fake news , \u201d insisting his administration is running like a fine-tuned machine . But for those who have known him , studied him and worked with him the longest , the more pressing question is whether Trump will be able to scale up . Is his well-established idiosyncratic style as a manager suited for this monumental task ?\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anything of scale that he \u2019 s had his hands on that he hasn \u2019 t made a hash of , \u201d biographer Tim O \u2019 Brien said in an interview last week .\n\u201c Ramping up , \u201d fellow biographer Gwenda Blair added , her tone dry , \u201c is something he \u2019 s maybe not so good at . \u201d\n\u201c When we worked together , \u201d Nobles said , \u201c he had three casinos in Atlantic City and he had the shuttle , and all four companies had their own operating systems , and I went to him and said , \u2018 Why don \u2019 t we combine these things ? \u2019 And he said , \u2018 No . I want those guys competing against each other . I think it will make all of them stronger. \u2019 Any normal businessman I know would have said , \u2018 Let \u2019 s take advantage of the economies of scale here. \u2019 He didn \u2019 t think like that . \u201d\nAnd as the \u2019 80s flipped to the \u2019 90s , the consequences of Trump \u2019 s unorthodox decisions were clear . \u201c All those businesses are gone , of course , \u201d Nobles said , \u201c because they weren \u2019 t as successful as they could have been\u2014and should have been . \u201d\nSo while smart , experienced political professionals have called the start to the Trump presidency unprecedented in the annals of the office , it is not unprecedented in the annals of Trump . Trump has managed in the Oval Office in Washington pretty much exactly the way he managed on Fifth Avenue in New York , say people who worked for him at different points over the past 45 years as well as writers of the best , most thoroughly reported Trump biographies . In recent interviews , they recounted a shrewd , slipshod , charming , vengeful , thin-skinned , belligerent , hard-charging manager who was an impulsive hirer and a reluctant firer and surrounded himself with a small cadre of ardent loyalists ; who solicited their advice but almost always ultimately went with his gut and did what he wanted ; who kept his door open and expected others to do the same not because of a desire for transparency but due to his own insecurities and distrusting disposition ; and who fostered a frenetic , internally competitive , around-the-clock , stressful , wearying work environment in which he was a demanding , disorienting mixture of hands-on and hands-off\u2014a hesitant delegator and an intermittent micromanager who favored fast-twitch wins over long-term follow-through , promotion over process and intuition over deliberation .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s the same Donald Trump as the Donald Trump I knew when I was working with him , \u201d said former Trump Organization executive vice president Louise Sunshine , who worked for Trump for 15 years starting in 1972 . \u201c Same management style . He \u2019 s always created competition and chaos . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he manages , \u201d said Artie Nusbaum , one of the heads of the construction company that built Trump Tower . \u201c I think he just lets it all happen . \u201d\n\u201c He gets an idea in his head and just says , \u2018 Do it , \u2019 \u201d said Barbara Res , a Trump Organization executive vice president in the \u2019 80s and \u2019 90s . \u201c There \u2019 s no direction . The idea isn \u2019 t built up or fleshed out . He just says , \u2018 Let \u2019 s do this. \u2019 It \u2019 s like a stream-of-consciousness thing with him . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s not a great manager , \u201d O \u2019 Brien said . \u201c He \u2019 s a performance artist pretending to be a great manager . \u201d\nTrump was at his best as an actual manager , as opposed to as an expert brander or as an effective reality TV star , according to O \u2019 Brien , Res and others , more than 30 years ago\u2014when he appeared to know what he didn \u2019 t know and hired people who could help him , and then let them do just that . This , they say , was the managerial style that enabled him to erect Trump Tower , which opened in 1983 . But some five years later , when Trump \u2019 s fame spiked in the wake of the publishing of The Art of the Deal and he tried to branch out and scale up by buying with billions of dollars of borrowed money a third casino in Atlantic City , the Plaza Hotel in New York and the aging fleet of planes so he could own an airline with his name on it , the result was an all-but-fatal business failure . If not for family money , the fact that the banks were as beholden to him as he was to them and the canny wizardry of a lender-mandated chief financial officer\u2014a position he had never had as part of his own staff\u2014Trump almost certainly would have had to declare personal bankruptcy . He might have become \u2019 80s-era trivia instead of the 45th president .\nTrump \u2019 s abilities as a manager have been a fixation for decades\u2014for him and for others . The appraisals haven \u2019 t always been in agreement .\n\u201c Although there is a board room , there is no board , \u201d Bill Geist wrote in a cover story in the New York Times Magazine in 1984 .\nThe Trump Organization , longtime Trump attorney George Ross told the New York Daily News in 2004 , \u201c is a dictatorship , not a democracy . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s assertive , aggressive and very in your face at the same time , \u201d Trump \u2019 s namesake son , Donald Trump Jr. , told biographer Robert Slater for his book that came out in 2005 . \u201c He can be very scatterbrained when he talks to someone , but it \u2019 s all for a purpose . He can get people confused . But he ultimately gets what he wants . \u201d\nThat hasn \u2019 t always been what his company needs . \u201c Donald \u2019 s erratic temperament distracted everyone from business objectives , \u201d Jack O \u2019 Donnell wrote in his book after he quit working as a casino executive for Trump , adding that Trump \u201c did business almost entirely in the moment. \u201d The Trump Organization , O \u2019 Brien wrote in his biography , \u201c catered to Donald \u2019 s zealousness and preference for quick decisions. \u201d Wrote Blair : \u201c There was no formal business plan , no development strategy . Instead Donald would come up with ideas , do the preliminary calculations in his head , then tell someone to get moving on it . \u201d\nTrump , too , of course , has said many things about Trump , and about this .\n\u201c Trump does well with management , \u201d Trump said in 1990 to a reporter from the New York Times for an article about his pending financial collapse .\n\u201c People rule in many ways , \u201d he wrote in 1997 in The Art of the Comeback , opting for an interesting verb . \u201c But whether through fear or respect , your opponents and even your friends must know they can \u2019 t push you around . If they can , you \u2019 re not the boss . They are . \u201d\nIn 2004 , in Think Like a Billionaire , he cited a book about narcissism . \u201c A narcissist does not hear the naysayers , \u201d he wrote , practically identifying himself as such . \u201c At the Trump Organization , I listen to people , but my vision is my vision . \u201d\nAll of this , of course , was said about Trump and by Trump in the context of Trump as a celebrity , pop-culture provocateur and private businessman . When he started running for president , though , and when he used as one of his main pitches his business and financial success , his managerial track record took on exponentially greater significance . If he wanted to be America \u2019 s first CEO president , what kind of CEO had he been ? If he wanted to manage the country , how had he managed his company ?\nEarly in the campaign , in the first week of September 2015 , when his candidacy was garnering undeniable support but still was considered primarily a through-the-roof-ratings curiosity , Max Abelson of Bloomberg Businessweek took it seriously . \u201c Trump is selling himself to America as the king of builders , a flawless dealmaker , and masterful manager . But he isn \u2019 t really any of those things , \u201d Abelson wrote , describing not so much a builder and a buyer\u2014at least not for a long time\u2014but rather a landlord , a licenser , a marketer and \u201c a golf bigwig \u201d who \u201c controls the teensiest details , rejects hierarchy , and picks top deputies by following his own recipe for promotion. \u201d Trump \u2019 s \u201c corporate leadership , \u201d he concluded , \u201c is a kind of teenager \u2019 s fantasy of adult office power . \u201d\nThroughout the rest of the campaign , the subsequent litany of stories in the major mainstream press scrutinized Trump \u2019 s array of less sterling business ventures , ranging from his late \u2019 80s mania to his more recent flops and duds and worse , like his \u201c university , \u201d his mortgage company and his impossibly leveraged casinos\u2014the only public company he had ever run , and a rolling , unmitigated failure for everybody but himself . \u201c The money I took out of there was incredible , \u201d he said last summer , while those who had invested in him were left losers . Trump has built with ballyhoo and hocus-pocus more than he has with concrete and glass , according to the reports , especially since his initial efforts to expand caused the Trump Organization to teeter toward ruin . He consistently has managed his image more effectively than he has managed his interests . Trump as a business boss was a show long before Mark Burnett gave it a name and put it on the air .\n\u201c Management is an art that is very important to me , \u201d Trump told \u2588\u2588\u2588 last summer , and loyal former and current employees said then in interviews with me that his management style would work wonderfully in the White House .\n\u201c It would transfer beautifully , \u201d said Ross , the attorney and a longtime executive vice president .\n\u201c He \u2019 s going to pick great people and let them do their job , \u201d former Trump Organization vice president Billy Procida said . \u201c He \u2019 s going to do what he does\u2014crisis management and strategic direction and then negotiations at a high level . Him and Putin will become best friends . He will disarm people . He \u2019 s disarming . I have seen him walk into rooms where people were ready to kill him , community groups , politicians , contractors\u2014and within five minutes , he has people eating out of his hand . He \u2019 s a charming son of a bitch , he \u2019 s a tough son of a bitch , he \u2019 s a smart son of a bitch . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Trump \u2019 s energy and remarkable work ethic , \u201d said Matthew Calamari , who started working for Trump in 1981 as a bodyguard and is now the Trump Organization \u2019 s chief operating officer , \u201c will make for an easy transition . \u201d\nHe has filled a fraction of the hundreds of important Senate-confirmed jobs necessary to make the federal government work . He has signed in staged ceremonies a flurry of executive orders that have felt at times raced-out and slapdash , including the immigration travel ban that has sparked nationwide protests and panic\u2014the revised version of which has yet to be released but will assuage , he assures , the objections of \u201c so-called \u201d judges . He has ousted his first national security adviser in the midst of the ongoing flaring of the Russia scandal , and he has watched a potential replacement for the job beg off for personal reasons , which most likely means he didn \u2019 t want to be personally subjected to the evident chaos inside the White House . In early-morning and late-night Twitter posts since his inauguration , he has attacked Nordstrom , the city of Chicago , Chuck Schumer , \u201c low-life leakers \u201d and \u201c so-called angry crowds \u201d of unsettled constituents . He has declared the press not only his \u201c enemy \u201d but \u201c the enemy of the American people , \u201d dismissing coverage he doesn \u2019 t like as \u201c Fake \u201d the way he labeled previous obstacles \u201c Little , \u201d \u201c Lyin \u2019 \u201d and \u201c Crooked. \u201d He has held a news conference in which he ranted and raved while insisting he wasn \u2019 t \u201c ranting and raving. \u201d He has had his press secretary do the same .\nThat tense Sean Spicer news conference , in fact , on the first full day of the Trump presidency , is what convinced one veteran former Trump Organization employee that there would be no new White House Trump .\nThe fact-free pushback , the picture props of the inauguration crowds on the Mall , \u201c denying the obvious \u201d \u2014for this person who knows Trump well , it was a telltale collection of Trump trademarks , a through-line from the 26th floor to the West Wing . \u201c And that set the tone for what this administration will be , \u201d he said .\nNobles , the former Trump Shuttle president , said the cross tweets littered with capital letters and exclamation points transport him to Trump Tower and the late \u2019 80s .\n\u201c None of us like to be criticized . I \u2019 ve never met anybody who does , but some of us handle it better than others\u2014and Donald doesn \u2019 t handle criticism at all , \u201d he said . \u201c He just has to fight back when he \u2019 s criticized . \u201d\nBiographer Michael D \u2019 Antonio concurred . \u201c The combativeness is a constant , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And the way he \u2019 s running people ragged\u2014that , I think , is classic Trump , \u201d he added . \u201c When you look at the people around him , when you see how exhausted they seem to be , that is something he \u2019 s always done . \u201d\nD \u2019 Antonio is far from a Trump booster\u2014he said last year he thinks Trump has attention-deficit disorder\u2014but he said last week he actually has been \u201c favorably impressed \u201d with some of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy hires , mentioning Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis and Lt. Gen. H.R . McMaster , the new national security adviser .\n\u201c To me , \u201d D \u2019 Antonio continued , \u201c it looks like he \u2019 s actually recognizing that there \u2019 s stuff that he doesn \u2019 t know , and that \u2019 s where he should find some well-qualified help\u2014and he \u2019 s actually doing it . They seem to be more experts than loyalists , and that \u2019 s a little fresh twist on his usual way of doing things . \u201d\nFor Sunshine , that much is reminiscent of how Trump was before the early \u2019 90s crackup , before The Art of the Deal , going back to his more focused , more disciplined years building Trump Tower . \u201c He used to have very competent , very capable , intelligent , positive voices around him , \u201d Sunshine said .\nThese days , though , watching from her home in Florida , she pinned the blame for Trump \u2019 s topsy-turvy first month as president on a few of his closest aides . \u201c Just listen to Kellyanne Conway . Just listen to her . You want to put a grapefruit in her mouth , \u201d Sunshine said . \u201c And Steve Bannon\u2014he \u2019 s living in another world . And look how many people who are around Donald are Bannon people . Like Steve Miller . \u201d\nProcida , meanwhile , last week raged into the phone about the first month of his former boss \u2019 first term .\n\u201c He \u2019 s trying to pick the right people and let \u2018 em do their job\u2014that was always his No . 1 thing\u2014and the problem is he hasn \u2019 t been able to get his people in . He \u2019 s really getting sabotaged at every turn , \u201d Procida said , lashing out at what he views as obstructionist Democrats and meddlesome media . \u201c I want him to be able to do his f -- -ing job . You want him to be able to do his f -- -ing job , whether you like him or not , right ? And if you hire me to be the point guard of your basketball team , are you really going to shout at me all the f -- -ing time while I \u2019 m dribbling the ball up the court ? \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s just it , according to many people who have worked for him over the years . Trump so seldom can .\n\u201c I remember one day we were trying to save the company , \u201d one longtime former inner-circle employee told me , recalling the Trump Organization \u2019 s struggle in the early \u2019 90s to stay afloat , \u201c and he walks into a meeting and says , \u2018 Let \u2019 s buy the New Jersey Nets . \u2019 \u201d\nBuying a professional basketball team would have been a stock Trump tactic , the person pointed out , a big , splashy story , a way to get reporters to write about something other than his financial travails , a conscious distraction meant for public consumption\u2014a surface-level \u201c fix \u201d to a deep , systemic problem .\nSome question whether the real victim of the distractions isn \u2019 t Trump himself and what he says he wants to accomplish .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s some serious managerial work to be done for him to fulfill his campaign promises , \u201d said O \u2019 Brien , the biographer . \u201c I think in order to scale up in anything , you have to have a strategic vision , a creative perspective about what you want to accomplish , and then you have to wed that to intellectual and managerial discipline , and that requires patience and perspective and an ability to delegate . And everything I \u2019 ve said in the preceding sentence are not attributes of Donald J. Trump . \u201d\nDifferent management styles have worked , and not worked , in the White House . And nobody ever has been fully prepared to be president . Presidents have said that . Presidential historians have said that . But according to O \u2019 Brien , who \u2019 s been reporting on Trump since the early \u2019 90s , the challenge for him is particularly steep : \u201c He now needs to build a global network that is completely unlike anything he \u2019 s built or relied on before . This isn \u2019 t just about a modest course correction . This is about getting an entire personality transplant . \u201d\nWill the weight of the job lead to an altered , more sober , more regimented approach to management\u2014a different Trump ?\nAnother former employee answered it . \u201c I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s ever going to evolve on managerial style , \u201d he said . \u201c On policy and strategy , he may change , but he \u2019 s never going to evolve in how he does things and runs things . Because that \u2019 s what got him to the Oval Office . \u201d",

Until now. As president, Trump sits at the top of a massive bureaucracy not of his own making, a complex hierarchy designed to help him handle the most information-intensive, crisis-driven job in the world. He appears to be struggling to adapt. Hundreds of positions remain vacant, key posts have been declined by wary nominees, poorly vetted picks have withdrawn or been rejected, and the day-to-day functioning of the West Wing has become its own running news story.

Trump has managed in the Oval Office in Washington pretty much exactly the way he managed on Fifth Avenue in New York, say people who worked for him at different points over the past 45 years as well as writers of the best, most thoroughly reported Trump biographies. In recent interviews, they recounted a shrewd, slipshod, charming, vengeful, thin-skinned, belligerent, hard-charging manager who was an impulsive hirer and a reluctant firer and surrounded himself with a small cadre of ardent loyalists; who solicited their advice but almost always ultimately went with his gut and did what he wanted; who kept his door open and expected others to do the same not because of a desire for transparency but due to his own insecurities and distrusting disposition; and who fostered a frenetic, internally competitive, around-the-clock, stressful, wearying work environment in which he was a demanding, disorienting mixture of hands-on and hands-off\u2014a hesitant delegator and an intermittent micromanager who favored fast-twitch wins over long-term follow-through, promotion over process and intuition over deliberation.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the same Donald Trump as the Donald Trump I knew when I was working with him,\u201d said former Trump Organization executive vice president Louise Sunshine, who worked for Trump for 15 years starting in 1972. \u201cSame management style.

The idea isn\u2019t built up or fleshed out. He just says, \u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019 It\u2019s like a stream-of-consciousness thing with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a great manager,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s a performance artist pretending to be a great manager.\u201d\n\nTrump was at his best as an actual manager, as opposed to as an expert brander or as an effective reality TV star, according to O\u2019Brien, Res and others, more than 30 years ago\u2014when he appeared to know what he didn\u2019t know and hired people who could help him, and then let them do just that. This, they say, was the managerial style that enabled him to erect Trump Tower, which opened in 1983. But some five years later, when Trump\u2019s fame spiked in the wake of the publishing of The Art of the Deal and he tried to branch out and scale up by buying with billions of dollars of borrowed money a third casino in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in New York and the aging fleet of planes so he could own an airline with his name on it, the result was an all-but-fatal business failure. If not for family money, the fact that the banks were as beholden to him as he was to them and the canny wizardry of a lender-mandated chief financial officer\u2014a position he had never had as part of his own staff\u2014Trump almost certainly would have had to declare personal bankruptcy. He might have become \u201980s-era trivia instead of the 45th president.\n\n***\n\nTrump\u2019s abilities as a manager have been a fixation for decades\u2014for him and for others. The appraisals haven\u2019t always been in agreement.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is a board room, there is no board,\u201d Bill Geist wrote in a cover story in the New York Times Magazine in 1984.\n\nThe Trump Organization, longtime Trump attorney George Ross told the New York Daily News in 2004, \u201cis a dictatorship, not a democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s assertive, aggressive and very in your face at the same time,\u201d Trump\u2019s namesake son, Donald Trump Jr., told biographer Robert Slater for his book that came out in 2005. \u201cHe can be very scatterbrained when he talks to someone, but it\u2019s all for a purpose. He can get people confused. But he ultimately gets what he wants.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t always been what his company needs. \u201cDonald\u2019s erratic temperament distracted everyone from business objectives,\u201d Jack O\u2019Donnell wrote in his book after he quit working as a casino executive for Trump, adding that Trump \u201cdid business almost entirely in the moment.\u201d The Trump Organization, O\u2019Brien wrote in his biography, \u201ccatered to Donald\u2019s zealousness and preference for quick decisions.\u201d Wrote Blair: \u201cThere was no formal business plan, no development strategy. Instead Donald would come up with ideas, do the preliminary calculations in his head, then tell someone to get moving on it.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, of course, has said many things about Trump, and about this.\n\n\u201cTrump does well with management,\u201d Trump said in 1990 to a reporter from the New York Times for an article about his pending financial collapse.\n\n\u201cPeople rule in many ways,\u201d he wrote in 1997 in The Art of the Comeback, opting for an interesting verb. \u201cBut whether through fear or respect, your opponents and even your friends must know they can\u2019t push you around. If they can, you\u2019re not the boss. They are.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, in Think Like a Billionaire, he cited a book about narcissism. \u201cA narcissist does not hear the naysayers,\u201d he wrote, practically identifying himself as such. \u201cAt the Trump Organization, I listen to people, but my vision is my vision.\u201d\n\nAll of this, of course, was said about Trump and by Trump in the context of Trump as a celebrity, pop-culture provocateur and private businessman. When he started running for president, though, and when he used as one of his main pitches his business and financial success, his managerial track record took on exponentially greater significance. If he wanted to be America\u2019s first CEO president, what kind of CEO had he been? If he wanted to manage the country, how had he managed his company?\n\nEarly in the campaign, in the first week of September 2015, when his candidacy was garnering undeniable support but still was considered primarily a through-the-roof-ratings curiosity, Max Abelson of Bloomberg Businessweek took it seriously. \u201cTrump is selling himself to America as the king of builders, a flawless dealmaker, and masterful manager. But he isn\u2019t really any of those things,\u201d Abelson wrote, describing not so much a builder and a buyer\u2014at least not for a long time\u2014but rather a landlord, a licenser, a marketer and \u201ca golf bigwig\u201d who \u201ccontrols the teensiest details, rejects hierarchy, and picks top deputies by following his own recipe for promotion.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201ccorporate leadership,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis a kind of teenager\u2019s fantasy of adult office power.\u201d\n\nThroughout the rest of the campaign, the subsequent litany of stories in the major mainstream press scrutinized Trump\u2019s array of less sterling business ventures, ranging from his late \u201980s mania to his more recent flops and duds and worse, like his \u201cuniversity,\u201d his mortgage company and his impossibly leveraged casinos\u2014the only public company he had ever run, and a rolling, unmitigated failure for everybody but himself. \u201cThe money I took out of there was incredible,\u201d he said last summer, while those who had invested in him were left losers. Trump has built with ballyhoo and hocus-pocus more than he has with concrete and glass, according to the reports, especially since his initial efforts to expand caused the Trump Organization to teeter toward ruin. He consistently has managed his image more effectively than he has managed his interests. Trump as a business boss was a show long before Mark Burnett gave it a name and put it on the air.\n\n\u201cManagement is an art that is very important to me,\u201d Trump told POLITICO last summer, and loyal former and current employees said then in interviews with me that his management style would work wonderfully in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt would transfer beautifully,\u201d said Ross, the attorney and a longtime executive vice president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to pick great people and let them do their job,\u201d former Trump Organization vice president Billy Procida said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what he does\u2014crisis management and strategic direction and then negotiations at a high level. Him and Putin will become best friends. He will disarm people. He\u2019s disarming. I have seen him walk into rooms where people were ready to kill him, community groups, politicians, contractors\u2014and within five minutes, he has people eating out of his hand. He\u2019s a charming son of a bitch, he\u2019s a tough son of a bitch, he\u2019s a smart son of a bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s energy and remarkable work ethic,\u201d said Matthew Calamari, who started working for Trump in 1981 as a bodyguard and is now the Trump Organization\u2019s chief operating officer, \u201cwill make for an easy transition.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHe has filled a fraction of the hundreds of important Senate-confirmed jobs necessary to make the federal government work. He has signed in staged ceremonies a flurry of executive orders that have felt at times raced-out and slapdash, including the immigration travel ban that has sparked nationwide protests and panic\u2014the revised version of which has yet to be released but will assuage, he assures, the objections of \u201cso-called\u201d judges. He has ousted his first national security adviser in the midst of the ongoing flaring of the Russia scandal, and he has watched a potential replacement for the job beg off for personal reasons, which most likely means he didn\u2019t want to be personally subjected to the evident chaos inside the White House. In early-morning and late-night Twitter posts since his inauguration, he has attacked Nordstrom, the city of Chicago, Chuck Schumer, \u201clow-life leakers\u201d and \u201cso-called angry crowds\u201d of unsettled constituents. He has declared the press not only his \u201cenemy\u201d but \u201cthe enemy of the American people,\u201d dismissing coverage he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cFake\u201d the way he labeled previous obstacles \u201cLittle,\u201d \u201cLyin\u2019\u201d and \u201cCrooked.\u201d He has held a news conference in which he ranted and raved while insisting he wasn\u2019t \u201cranting and raving.\u201d He has had his press secretary do the same.\n\nThat tense Sean Spicer news conference, in fact, on the first full day of the Trump presidency, is what convinced one veteran former Trump Organization employee that there would be no new White House Trump.\n\nThe fact-free pushback, the picture props of the inauguration crowds on the Mall, \u201cdenying the obvious\u201d\u2014for this person who knows Trump well, it was a telltale collection of Trump trademarks, a through-line from the 26th floor to the West Wing. \u201cAnd that set the tone for what this administration will be,\u201d he said.\n\nNobles, the former Trump Shuttle president, said the cross tweets littered with capital letters and exclamation points transport him to Trump Tower and the late \u201980s.\n\n\u201cNone of us like to be criticized. I\u2019ve never met anybody who does, but some of us handle it better than others\u2014and Donald doesn\u2019t handle criticism at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just has to fight back when he\u2019s criticized.\u201d\n\nBiographer Michael D\u2019Antonio concurred. \u201cThe combativeness is a constant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd the way he\u2019s running people ragged\u2014that, I think, is classic Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you look at the people around him, when you see how exhausted they seem to be, that is something he\u2019s always done.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Antonio is far from a Trump booster\u2014he said last year he thinks Trump has attention-deficit disorder\u2014but he said last week he actually has been \u201cfavorably impressed\u201d with some of Trump\u2019s foreign policy hires, mentioning Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the new national security adviser.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d D\u2019Antonio continued, \u201cit looks like he\u2019s actually recognizing that there\u2019s stuff that he doesn\u2019t know, and that\u2019s where he should find some well-qualified help\u2014and he\u2019s actually doing it. They seem to be more experts than loyalists, and that\u2019s a little fresh twist on his usual way of doing things.\u201d\n\nFor Sunshine, that much is reminiscent of how Trump was before the early \u201990s crackup, before The Art of the Deal, going back to his more focused, more disciplined years building Trump Tower. \u201cHe used to have very competent, very capable, intelligent, positive voices around him,\u201d Sunshine said.\n\nThese days, though, watching from her home in Florida, she pinned the blame for Trump\u2019s topsy-turvy first month as president on a few of his closest aides. \u201cJust listen to Kellyanne Conway. Just listen to her. You want to put a grapefruit in her mouth,\u201d Sunshine said. \u201cAnd Steve Bannon\u2014he\u2019s living in another world. And look how many people who are around Donald are Bannon people. Like Steve Miller.\u201d\n\nProcida, meanwhile, last week raged into the phone about the first month of his former boss\u2019 first term.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to pick the right people and let \u2018em do their job\u2014that was always his No. 1 thing\u2014and the problem is he hasn\u2019t been able to get his people in. He\u2019s really getting sabotaged at every turn,\u201d Procida said, lashing out at what he views as obstructionist Democrats and meddlesome media. \u201cI want him to be able to do his f---ing job. You want him to be able to do his f---ing job, whether you like him or not, right? And if you hire me to be the point guard of your basketball team, are you really going to shout at me all the f---ing time while I\u2019m dribbling the ball up the court?\u201d\n\nProcida stopped to catch his breath.\n\n\u201cIf he could just put f---ing blinders on \u2026\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s just it, according to many people who have worked for him over the years. Trump so seldom can.\n\n\u201cI remember one day we were trying to save the company,\u201d one longtime former inner-circle employee told me, recalling the Trump Organization\u2019s struggle in the early \u201990s to stay afloat, \u201cand he walks into a meeting and says, \u2018Let\u2019s buy the New Jersey Nets.\u2019\u201d\n\nBuying a professional basketball team would have been a stock Trump tactic, the person pointed out, a big, splashy story, a way to get reporters to write about something other than his financial travails, a conscious distraction meant for public consumption\u2014a surface-level \u201cfix\u201d to a deep, systemic problem.\n\n\u201cI just said, \u2018Uh, Donald \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nSome question whether the real victim of the distractions isn\u2019t Trump himself and what he says he wants to accomplish.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some serious managerial work to be done for him to fulfill his campaign promises,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, the biographer. \u201cI think in order to scale up in anything, you have to have a strategic vision, a creative perspective about what you want to accomplish, and then you have to wed that to intellectual and managerial discipline, and that requires patience and perspective and an ability to delegate. And everything I\u2019ve said in the preceding sentence are not attributes of Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nDifferent management styles have worked, and not worked, in the White House. And nobody ever has been fully prepared to be president. Presidents have said that. Presidential historians have said that. But according to O\u2019Brien, who\u2019s been reporting on Trump since the early \u201990s, the challenge for him is particularly steep: \u201cHe now needs to build a global network that is completely unlike anything he\u2019s built or relied on before. This isn\u2019t just about a modest course correction. This is about getting an entire personality transplant.\u201d\n\nWill the weight of the job lead to an altered, more sober, more regimented approach to management\u2014a different Trump?\n\n\u201cWill he evolve?\u201d Nobles said. \u201cGood question.\u201d\n\nAnother former employee answered it. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to evolve on managerial style,\u201d he said. \u201cOn policy and strategy, he may change, but he\u2019s never going to evolve in how he does things and runs things. Because that\u2019s what got him to the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n",
