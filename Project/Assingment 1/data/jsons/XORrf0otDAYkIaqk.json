    "content": "One of the things that greatly frustrates me is that so many Americans allow other people to do their thinking for them .\nWe have become a nation of sheeple , and the vast majority of the shepherds that we are relying on for guidance are frauds and imposters . The blind are leading the blind , and we are slowly but surely committing national suicide . If a lot more of us don \u2019 t start to learn to think for ourselves , I fear that the vast majority of the population will never wake up until it is far too late .\nIf you are not preoccupied with work or with family matters , then you are probably thinking about something that you have been fed through the mainstream media . Just think about this for a few moments . When you are sitting around the dinner table or you are chatting with someone at work , what do you tend to talk about ? If you are like most people , many of your conversations will be about something that you saw on the news , a new movie that you just watched , or a sporting event that has just happened .\nMost of the time , we believe that certain things are important because someone else has told us that they are important .\nAnd the most prominent voices of all are the six gigantic media corporations that control about 90 percent of the news , information and entertainment that we get through our televisions . I know that statistic is a bit hard to believe , so let me share a little excerpt from a fact checking website called truthorfiction.com\u2026\nSummary of eRumor : Six corporations own 90 % of news media companies in America . The Truth : This claim is true . News Corp , Disney , Viacom , Time Warner , CBS and Comcast own 90 % of the TV stations , radio stations , movies , magazines and newspapers that 277 million Americans rely on for news and entertainment .\nOf course those six corporate behemoths are owned by the elite of the world , and that is why \u201c the news \u201d never seems to change very much no matter where you get it .\nIt is imperative that we understand that everyone has an agenda . Every single movie , television show , documentary and news program is trying to shape how you think . Sadly , many people completely disengage their mental filters once they sit down in front of the television , and they just passively consume whatever \u201c programming \u201d that is offered to them without even thinking twice about where it is coming from .\nEarlier today , I discovered that the following story was trending online : \u201c This Calf Looks Suspiciously Like Gene Simmons And People Want Answers \u201d .\nWell , the truth is that at some point a big media gatekeeper somewhere decided that this is something that we should all be focusing on .\nBut of course there are thousands of pressing issues that would be far more worthy of our attention . The key is to keep us all confused and distracted so that we can never focus on what is truly important .\nOne of the biggest reasons why we are so easily controlled as a society is because our system of public education does not teach critical thinking skills to our young people .

No wonder our young people are rapidly falling behind the rest of the industrialized world .\nDid you ever see the big Hollywood film that was entitled \u201c Idiocracy \u201c ? Sometimes I feel like I am permanently trapped inside that movie . If you ask people why they do the things that they do on a daily basis , most of them can not give you a coherent answer .\nI am even discovering that this is true in the world of politics .
