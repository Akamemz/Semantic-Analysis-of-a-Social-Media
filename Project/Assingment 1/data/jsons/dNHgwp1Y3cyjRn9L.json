    "content": "Days after calling for an overhaul of gun control in New York following the Connecticut school shooting , Gov . Andrew Cuomo worked out a tough proposal on gun control with legislative leaders who promised to pass the most restrictive gun law in the nation .\nThe measure passed the Senate 43-18 on the strength of support from Democrats , many of whom previously sponsored the bills that were once blocked by Republicans .\nThe Democrat-led Assembly gaveled out before midnight and planned to take the issue up at 10 a.m. Tuesday . It is expected to pass easily .\n`` This is a scourge on society , '' Cuomo said Monday night , one month after the Newtown , Conn. , shooting that took the lives of 20 first graders and six educators . `` At what point do you say , ` No more innocent loss of life . '' '\n`` It is well-balanced , it protects the Second Amendment , '' said Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos of Long Island . `` And there is no confiscation of weapons , which was at one time being considered .\n`` This is going to go after those who are bringing illegal guns into the state , who are slaughtering people in New York City , '' Skelos said . `` This is going to put people in jail and keep people in jail who should n't be out on the street in the first place .

Jeffrey Klein , leader of the Independent Democrat Conference that shares majority control with Republican senators . `` All in all , it is a comprehensive , balanced approach that will save lives , '' Klein said in an interview .\nCuomo said he wanted quick action to avoid a run on assault rifles and ammunition as he tries to address what he estimates is about 1 million assault rifles in New York state .
