    "content": "On Monday , the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country . Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , it \u2019 s based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks \u2019 gestation can feel pain .\n\u201c The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless , the vulnerable , and the marginalized , '' said Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R-CA ) , the House majority leader , in a statement in September ( the House passed the bill in early October ) . `` It will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain. \u201d While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required , President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes ; during the campaign , he said such a bill \u201c would end painful late-term abortions nationwide . \u201d\nIn fact , the best available science shows that fetuses probably can not feel pain until well after 20 weeks . Advocates of abortion rights say 20-week bans at the state level have harmed women , forcing them to travel to another state , often at great expense , to get the care they seek . And opponents of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act fear that , even if it never passes , it will ultimately spread dangerous misinformation .\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not based on accepted science\nThe bill , sponsored by Sen.

Women seeking abortions would not be penalized under the bill .\nThe text of the bill includes a section on the science of fetal pain , which states that \u201c there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization , if not earlier . \u201d\nHowever , the general scientific consensus is that no such evidence exists . \u201c There \u2019 s actually conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren \u2019 t completely laid down and working yet until much further along in pregnancy , we think even the third trimester , \u201d said Jennifer Conti , a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health . Twenty weeks , she said , \u201c is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing . \u201d\nThe most comprehensive look at fetal pain to date was a literature review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005 . According to the review , the structures needed for fetuses to feel pain begin to develop between 23 and 30 weeks \u2019 gestation , and studies of premature babies suggest they can \u2019 t feel pain until 29 or 30 weeks . While this review is now 12 years old , it still holds true \u2014 \u201c no research since its publication has contradicted its findings , \u201d wrote Mark S.
