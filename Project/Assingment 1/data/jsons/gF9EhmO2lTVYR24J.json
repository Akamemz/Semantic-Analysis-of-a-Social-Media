    "content": "In retrospect , Pew \u2019 s 2016 survey on party ID should have been a wake-up call for a lot of people . It wasn \u2019 t , because almost all pollsters ( including Pew themselves ) were seeing large leads for Democrats in the national vote for the presidential race and people were feeling content about that . It turns out , of course , that pollsters weren \u2019 t really measuring the right thing : they were n't contacting enough non-college white voters and weren \u2019 t correctly weighting the ones they did contact , which screwed things up in state-level polls in states where non-college whites make up a disproportionately large part of the electorate . Pew \u2019 s 2016 party ID found Democratic identification falling off nationally ( down to 48 D-44 R , way off from the heady days of 2008 ) \u2014which , by itself , isn \u2019 t that unusual , as it happens to any party in power regardless of how well they perform in office ( it \u2019 s what we call \u201c thermostatic public opinion \u201d ) \u2014but with the vast bulk of that erosion happening among white males , white senior citizens , and whites without college degrees . Knowing that , and weighting for that , could have saved a lot of pollsters a lot of grief in 2016 .\nSo , today , let \u2019 s look at the flip side of who moved away from the Democrats in 2016 , and who is currently leading the flight away from the Republicans in 2018 : women , young people , and people with college degrees . ( Race , interestingly , is n't as much of a factor , simply because non-white voters didn \u2019 t move at all toward the Republicans in 2016 , and remain maxed out enough that there isn \u2019 t the same level of even-more movement to the Democrats now . There \u2019 s one sort-of exception for Asians , who were close to a swingy demographic in the 1990s but are now voting Democratic at nearly the same rate as Latinos , breaking 65 D and 27 R in Pew \u2019 s 2018 study . )\nThe gender gap , for instance , is larger than ever , with women identifying 56 percent Democratic and 37 percent Republican , a 19-point gap ( though it \u2019 s on a similar level with where we were in 2008 ) . That \u2019 s a significant improvement from 1994 , when the Dems had only a 6-point lead among women . Note , also , some significant improvement among men , not just from 1994 ( pretty much the Dems \u2019 low water mark in every category ) but even from 2016 .\nAnd , again , the \u201c leaner \u201d numbers show the importance of not just looking at independents but asking how they break . If you just looked at the raw data , you \u2019 d assume that things were flat for the Democrats among women ; it was 37 D in 1994 and 39 D now , though with independents moving ahead of the GOP recently . But by pushing independents who lean , you can see that \u201c independent \u201d women actually break for the Democrats by an almost 2-to-1 margin .\nOne of the major story lines of the 2016 election was the sudden and looming presence of an education gap , one that was nearly as significant as the long-understood gender gap . You could certainly see it when you looked at county-level results , where the Democrats collapsed in longtime strongholds in blue-collar parts of the upper Midwest while picking up iconic , historically Republican suburban counties across the Sun Belt .\nPew \u2019 s 2018 numbers show even further acceleration of that trend , especially when you narrow the view down to just white voters . Non-white voters vote heavily Democratic enough that you don \u2019 t see a lot of difference regardless of education level . Also , looking at , for instance , the \u201c high school or less \u201d numbers across all races would n't really tell you that there \u2019 s a huge problem for Democrats among white voters there ; there are enough black and Latino voters in the \u201c high school or less \u201d pool that , overall , the Democrats nearly draw even , at 47 R , 45 D .\nWhen you zoom in on just white voters , though , the education gap looks huge . There \u2019 s been a bit of snap-back , relative to 2016 , among white voters without college degrees ( and that \u2019 s something that we \u2019 ve seen in special elections this cycle , where there \u2019 s been even stronger movement in the Dem direction in more rural , Midwestern districts than in suburban areas ) ; the overall gap , though , in favor of Republicans among white voters with \u201c high school or less \u201d is still large , relative to the pre-2016 period . ( If you go back to the Bill Clinton era , you can see that the Dems actually had a brief , small edge among non-high school whites ! ) With leaners included , it \u2019 s currently 58 R , 35 D .\nMeanwhile , the Dems hit new heights of performance with college-educated whites in 2016 , and that trend has only accelerated since then . Among whites with college degrees , the current advantage when leaners are included in 49 D , 46 R ( the first Democratic lead in that category in , well , ever ) . Among those with \u201c postgrad experience , \u201d there \u2019 s now actually a gap bigger than the gender gap ; the Dem lead is 59 D , 37 R. By comparison , back in the bad old days of 1994 , the GOP was the de facto home of whites with college degrees , at 59 R , 34 D , and drew even among post-grads , at 47 R , 46 D. ( If you don \u2019 t believe me , go back and take a look at county-level maps of elections in the 1980s and 1990s . Guys like Michael Dukakis lost northeastern suburban counties that we \u2019 ve taken for granted since then . )\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that turnout , especially in midterms , is much higher among people at higher education levels . One caveat ( and rightly so ) that many people have had when looking at large Democratic advantages on the generic House ballot this year , is that Democrats have traditionally had a harder time turning out their base for midterm elections . What \u2019 s changed this year is that their base is increasingly consisting of demographics that tend to turn out regularly and , conversely , the Republicans find themselves increasingly reliant on a base that \u2019 s less inclined to turn out in off years . ( This graphic , by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Elections \u2019 Daniel Donner , is based on Census post-election surveys on turnout from 2014 , and , when paired with Pew \u2019 s latest party ID data , illustrates the GOP \u2019 s sudden problem . )\nFinally , let \u2019 s take a look at the growing generation gap . Pew attracted a lot of attention recently when they finally declared the \u201c Millennial \u201d generation over . ( The fuddy-duddys at the Census Bureau don \u2019 t name generations , leaving folks like Pew as the main arbiters of how to put people in cleverly-named buckets by age . ) Well , the millennials aren \u2019 t all dead . What they meant is that all of the millennials have now aged into the electorate \u2014 they draw the cutoff at the birth year of 1996 , meaning that the youngest millennial is now 21 . This also means that Pew is going to need to start surveying respondents from the generation that comes after that , which they admit they haven \u2019 t come up with a name for\u2014yet .\nAnd it turns out that the millennials are , by far , the most Democratic-leaning generation . They \u2019 ve held that status as long as Pew has been measuring them separately ; even in 2004 , they were 53 D , 38 R with leaners included . But now they \u2019 re at 59 D , 32 R\u2014meaning that the \u201c millennial gap \u201d is even bigger than the gender gap or the education gap .\nThere starts to be a multiplier effect when you zoom in specifically on millennial women : the gap there is an eye-popping 70 D , 23 R , which is a big gain from 2004 , when the gap among millennial women was 54 D , 36 R. ( By contrast , millennial men have a gap of merely 49 D , 41 R. That \u2019 s significantly better than any other generation , though ; Republicans have a significant lead among men from the other three generations . )\nPart of the millennial gap , compared with other generations , is based on racial composition . The millennial generation , after all , is much more racially diverse than previous generations ( though it \u2019 s got nothing on the current up-and-coming generation of current K-12 students , which is already plurality non-white ) . But even among white millennials alone , there \u2019 s a Democratic edge of 52 D , 41 R with leaners included . No other generation has a Democratic gap when you pare it down to just its white members . And when you look at non-white millennials , the gap shoots up to 72 D , 18 R .\nIt is worth noting that the millennial generation has the biggest share , by far , of people who identify as independents ( without leaners included , millennials are 44 I , 35 D , 17 R ) . Many of those independents , however , lean Democratic . Interestingly , though , more than half of the \u201c independents , \u201d when you push leaners , identify as Republican , suggesting that there \u2019 s a large pool of 20-somethings who aren \u2019 t on board with the Democrats but who are ashamed to publicly identify as Republican .\nFinally , the generational data points to a major problem for the Republicans in coming years : they \u2019 re more reliant than ever on a group of people who , increasingly , are permanently leaving the electorate ( through death , rather than by choice ) : the Silent Generation , i.e . people born 1928-1945 . This is the only one of the four generations that has moved substantially in the GOP \u2019 s direction in the last two decades , going from an actual Dem advantage in 1994 ( 46 D , 45 R with leaners included ) to a big gap in the GOP \u2019 s favor today ( 52 R , 43 D ) . By contrast , both the Boomers and Generation X have moved from narrow GOP advantages in the 1990s to narrow Dem advantages now .\nWhen you add up all the data , the swing toward the Democrats jibes very well with what we \u2019 ve been seeing on the ground , not just with special election results , but also with scholarly investigations of who \u2019 s most heavily involved in new pop-up activist groups like Indivisible and Swing Left : it \u2019 s disproportionately college-educated women in the suburbs , who weren \u2019 t that active in politics but were strongly motivated by the dismaying results of the 2016 election . It also reflects where we \u2019 re seeing some of our best pickup opportunities evolving in 2018 , in suburban locales like Orange County , California ; exurban New Jersey ; and suburbs of cities like Dallas , Houston , and Atlanta .",
