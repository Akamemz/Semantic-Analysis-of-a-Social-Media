    "content": "In a stinging rebuke of President Donald Trump \u2019 s controversial decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel earlier this month , 128 countries , including some of the US \u2019 s most trusted and reliable allies , voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of his position . Only nine countries voted against it .\nThough the resolution doesn \u2019 t explicitly refer to the US , it \u2019 s clearly directed at the White House . The measure declares that any changes to the status of Jerusalem \u201c have no legal effect , are null and void and must be rescinded . \u201d\nIt also \u201c calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem \u201d \u2014 another shot at the administration , which announced plans to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .\nThe closest thing the US got to support from allies was 35 abstentions . Friends of the US like Canada , Mexico , and Australia refrained from voting on the resolution \u2014 which means that while they didn \u2019 t support the US with a vote against it , they didn \u2019 t criticize the US either with a vote in favor of it .\nWhile the passage of the resolution isn \u2019 t binding \u2014 meaning the US doesn \u2019 t actually have to reverse its position \u2014 it \u2019 s a stark illustration of just how isolated the United States is in its stance toward Israel .\nThursday \u2019 s vote took place at a rare emergency session of the 193-member UN General Assembly . Turkey and Yemen , on behalf of two international organizations of Arab and Muslim countries , called for the emergency session after the US vetoed a similar resolution at the UN Security Council on Monday . Unlike at the Security Council , the US does not have veto power at the broader General Assembly .\nThe administration made a concerted effort to swing countries to its side before the UN vote . Earlier in the week , US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley promised the US would be \u201c taking names \u201d of those who voted against the US . She also sent a letter to the UN ambassadors of more than 180 member countries warning that any vote in favor of the resolution would be taken \u201c personally \u201d by the president himself .\nPresident Trump suggested during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that he would withhold billions of dollars in aid for countries that voted against the US .\n\u201c Let them vote against us ; we \u2019 ll save a lot , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We don \u2019 t care . \u201d\nAnd in a speech before the General Assembly right before the vote on Thursday , Haley escalated things even further , threatening to cut off US funding to the UN over the vote .\n\u201c When we make generous contributions to the UN , we also have a legitimate expectation that our good will is recognized and respected , \u201d Haley said . \u201c When a nation is singled out for attack in this organization , that nation is disrespected . \u201d\n\u201c We have an obligation to demand more for our investment , \u201d she said .\nBut the pressure campaign didn \u2019 t work very well . Even close US allies like the UK and Egypt were unmoved by America \u2019 s dark warnings . And the fact that the vote stacked so heavily against the US after an unusually aggressive campaign from the Trump administration against it only exacerbated the optics of isolation .\nRichard Gowan , a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations , told me Haley \u2019 s abrasive politicking was a bit surprising . \u201c While diplomats expect Trump to be crude , they may have expected a bit better from Haley . She is normally more pragmatic . \u201d\nThere are even signs that the heavy-handed threats backfired . Barak Ravid , a correspondent for Israel \u2019 s Channel 10 news , reported that Canada switched from voting against the resolution to abstaining in order to avoid looking like a puppet of the US .\nThat Haley had to resort to such measures to try to convince even a few countries to side with the US highlights the extraordinary sensitivity surrounding Jerusalem , which has sites holy to Jews , Christians , and Muslims , and which both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim as their capital .\nJerusalem has always been polarizing .
