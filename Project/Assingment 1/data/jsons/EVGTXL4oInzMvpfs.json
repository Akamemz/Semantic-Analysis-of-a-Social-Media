    "content": "From the very beginning , NR has stood against the \u2018 irresponsible Right . \u2019\nThis weekend marks the one-year anniversary of the Nazi troll armies \u2019 march on Charlottesville , Va. To commemorate it , there will even be a march in Washington . No doubt many a parent \u2019 s fridge will be drained of provisions for the arduous journey to the nation \u2019 s capital .\nWhile all attention will surely be on these sad events , it \u2019 s worth noting that we missed the 60th anniversary of another Washington protest just two weeks ago : The above-referenced \u201c Save Ike from the Kikes \u201d rally outside the White House on July 29 , 1958 .\nIt was led by George Lincoln Rockwell , the head of the National Committee to Free America from Jewish Domination .\nThe rally cost Rockwell some of his financial backers and hurt him with his own family too . But Rockwell , while shaken by the failure of the event , had his confidence restored when he was , in his telling , visited by Adolf Hitler in a series of dreams . He went on to found the American Nazi Party ( and for a time tried to form a popular front against the Jooooz with the Nation of Islam . He called Elijah Muhammed the black Adolf Hitler . History is fun . ) .\n\u201c A vigorous and incorruptible journal of conservative opinion is \u2014 dare we say it ? \u2014 as necessary to better living as Chemistry , \u201d wrote William F. Buckley in the mission statement in the first issue . Buckley also noted , \u201c We begin publishing , then , with a considerable stock of experience with the irresponsible Right . \u201d\nThat experience would only get more extensive over the years to come .\nOne of the first challenges came from the venerable magazine The American Mercury \u2014 of H. L. Mencken and Albert Jay Nock fame \u2014 which had been bought in 1952 by Russell Maguire , a thoroughly anti-Semitic crank , in the tradition of Henry Ford and other tycoons who thought that the perfidious Jews were behind all that was wrong with the world . ( I \u2019 m sorry to tell Charlie Cooke that Maguire also counted the Thompson Machine Gun business among his holdings . ) At first , Buckley would later recall , Maguire kept his Judeophobia out of his magazine . But as Maguire grew more confident , the once-admirable Mercury sank deeper into the swampy muck .\n\u201c In the first three years of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Buckley and the editors had expressed their antipathy to the \u2018 irresponsible right \u2019 by ignoring rather than criticizing it , \u201d John Judis writes in his useful biography of WFB . But by the spring of 1959 , \u201c he was forced to go further . \u201d\nIn January of 1959 , The Mercury had run an editorial \u201c revealing \u201d a Jewish conspiracy of world conquest along the lines of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion .\nBuckley was under pressure from backers of NR and others to publicly rebuke and denounce The Mercury . But some on the NR board worried that it would cost the fledgling magazine many of its subscribers . One board member , Mrs. A. E. Bonbrake , whom Judis describes as \u201c a Forest Hills housewife whom Buckley had promoted to the board as a representative grass-roots activist , \u201d asked , \u201c Since when is it the job of \u2588\u2588\u2588 to attack supposedly anti-Semitic publications ? \u201d\n\u201c But Buckley felt hypocritical at remaining silent , \u201d Judis recounts . \u201c He wrote Bonbrake , \u201c I do not feel comfortable criticizing Liberals . . . for not disavowing objectionable Liberals , when I do not myself [ disavow objectionable conservatives ] . \u201d\nBuckley first settled for a compromise : \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s editors would not write for The Mercury nor would \u2588\u2588\u2588 publish anyone associated with it . If you were on their masthead , you couldn \u2019 t be on ours . Remember , The Mercury had long been a respected publication on the right , and many of the writers at \u2588\u2588\u2588 had cut their teeth writing for it . Many were on both mastheads , in one capacity or another . No longer . You can be with us or with them , but not both . All but one writer sided with \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nJames Burnham and Whittaker Chambers enthusiastically agreed with Buckley . Chambers welcomed the memo as a \u201c liberation. \u201d \u201c How good , and how strong , it is to take a principled position , \u201d Chambers wrote to Buckley . \u201c It defines , and defining , frees . Now what is good and strong outside us can draw to us , about whom there is , in this connection , no longer question , equivocation . The dregs will be drawn to the dregs , and sink where they belong . \u201d\nA few subscriptions were canceled , but not many . Quickly , other leading conservatives followed NR \u2019 s example and repudiated The Mercury .\nMaguire was furious that Buckley had broken the popular-front orthodoxy of the Right . Maguire soon shriveled up to a footnote in obscure books ; Buckley went the other direction , to understate it dramatically .\nNow , I am not trying to whitewash \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s history . NR would go on to make some morally grievous editorial errors , particularly on civil rights . It would also rally to the defense of cranks , anti-Semites , and demagogues on too many occasions , albeit on free-speech grounds or in the name of the noble cause of anti-Communism .\nAnd with the advantage of hindsight , one can argue that NR dawdled in excommunicating other elements of the irresponsible Right . That is always an issue with conservatives , who , by nature and design , prefer to measure at least twice before cutting even once . ( \u201c I must bear with infirmities until they fester into crimes , \u201d as Edmund Burke said . )\nBut the principle that \u2588\u2588\u2588 should see itself as a steward of the responsible Right was not only established , it was tested , often . For example , see Al Felzenberg \u2019 s excellent account of Buckley \u2019 s decision to defenestrate the John Birch Society or Buckley \u2019 s famous essay \u201c In Search of Anti-Semitism . \u201d\nIn other words , if you want to argue that NR imperfectly lived up to its ideals , I can offer no categorical refutation . But I am unaware of any human or human institution that can be exonerated from such a charge . Indeed , no realistic moral principle is wounded by the charge that humans fail to execute it perfectly .\nI bring all of this up because I am fairly disgusted by the current state of affairs .\nAs I recount in my latest column , the debate over whether or not social-media platforms should ban or shun Alex Jones is a sweeping indictment of the collective failure of countless institutions and individuals in our present age .\nI am not referring to specific arguments , pro or con , on the question of what Facebook or Twitter should be doing . I find merit on all sides of that debate . I find myself in the darkly shaded portion of the Venn diagram between Jonathan Last \u2019 s camp and David French \u2019 s .\nWhat bothers me is how high these bucks had to go before anyone thought , \u201c Maybe it should stop with me ? \u201d\nI \u2019 ve been writing a lot about how entertainment values have corrupted our politics . As I write in my book , \u201c When we suspend disbelief , we also suspend adherence to the conventions and legalisms of the outside world . Instead , we use the more primitive parts of our brains , which understand right and wrong as questions of \u2018 us \u2019 and \u2018 them . \u2019 \u201d\nThis helps explain so much of the kayfabe nature of the Trump presidency , including the \u201c I \u2019 d rather be a Russian than a Democrat \u201d swag among supposed \u201c America First \u201d \u201c nationalists , \u201d Laura Ingraham \u2019 s nativist remarks the other night , and this sort of nonsense from Jeanine Pirro .\nThis isn \u2019 t purely a literary or metaphysical argument . The world that the Internet and cable television created flattened the landscape . \u2588\u2588\u2588 may still see itself as a gatekeeper , but the high walls that housed the gate , and gave the gate purpose , have been toppled . Tribalism isn \u2019 t just about us-vs.-them , it \u2019 s also about deferring to fame and status , investing in personalities rather than principles . As institutions lose their hold on us , we put our faith in celebrities .\nFame becomes its own defense , and instead of invoking principles to stigmatize and shun the irresponsible famous , we yoke convenient principles to the cause of rationalizing our feelings . The round peg of the First Amendment is crammed into square holes . Populist and anti-elitist boilerplate is slapped together to protect the indefensible from criticism . So-and-so has an \u201c authentic constituency , \u201d \u201c Who are you to say what is a legitimate point of view ? \u201d \u201c Who put you in charge of policing speech ? \u201d\nOr as Mrs. Bonbrake once put it , \u201c Since when is it the job of \u2588\u2588\u2588 to attack supposedly anti-Semitic publications ? \u201d\nUnder the right conditions , swamps grow . Like water seeking its level , bogs claim whatever they are allowed to claim until stopped by nature or man . That \u201c supposedly \u201d is the rhetorical device that says , \u201c Let the swamp grass grow , it \u2019 s not my responsibility to prune it. \u201d There was no legitimate defense of The Mercury against the charge of anti-Semitism . But by saying it was only \u201c supposedly \u201d anti-Semitic , Mrs. Bonbrake was really saying , \u201c I choose not to care about the true or the good ; instead I will let evil thrive , sheltered by a benefit of the doubt both unearned and unwanted by the rightly accused . \u201d\nI am not a huge fan of the argument that says , \u201c The only cure for bad speech is more speech. \u201d But if that argument is to mean anything at all , it must be applied seriously . In other words , if you want to defend the speech of Alex Jones or the bigots swarming out of the swamps , you can not then denounce , belittle , or mock the exercise of anyone \u2019 s right to condemn that speech .\nWhen it falls to a bunch of giant corporations \u2014 or the federal government \u2014 to decide what speech is permissible , it is usually a sign that the rest of civil society has failed to do its job . It is axiomatic that in a free society with a limited government , customs and norms should be strong and robust . Authoritarian and totalitarian regimes require that all the rules be set from the top . The people have no right to organize institutions around values of their own choosing .\nBack when Steve Bannon was still ginning up the alt-right and trying to turn Breitbart into a platform for it , the response from many on the right was to adopt a popular-front mentality and genuflect to the popularity and fame of performance artists such as Milo Yiannopoulos . Some of this was motivated by simple ignorance of the truth \u2014 an ignorance people such as Bannon and Yiannopoulos were all too eager to fuel . My view then , and now , is that everyone should not only be forced to choose between traditional conservatism and the alt-right but that they should force that choice on others . The correct response to the question , \u201c Who am I to call out supposed bigots ? \u201d is \u201c You \u2019 re a human being , an American , a Christian , Jew , conservative , liberal , or citizen . \u201d\nThe same goes for cynical psychopaths such as Alex Jones . It was outrageous for Donald Trump to go on his show and praise him . It is outrageous and irresponsible that mainstream outlets blithely give airtime to clickbait hucksters and racist rabble-rousers .\nThe other day , I saw Candace Owens on several Fox News shows . I am not a fan of Owens , but my objection is not that she appeared on Fox or that Fox invited her to appear . My objection is that she has been a guest on Alex Jones \u2019 s Infowars .\nNow , it is unfair to say that Owens should be banned for violating a rule that did not exist in the past . After all , lots of people have been getting the message that celebrity is its own reward and that anything done in service to your \u201c personal brand \u201d is justified if it \u201c works \u201d \u2014 in the form of getting you more clicks , ratings , or YouTube subscribers . But there would be nothing wrong and much that is right if Fox simply said , going forward , \u201c If you exercise your free-speech rights by appearing on Alex Jones \u2019 s show , we will exercise our free-speech rights and bar you from ours . \u201d\nOh , and if you think such niceties are unnecessary today because \u201c winning \u201d is the highest principle in an existential war with \u201c the libs , \u201d bear in mind that Buckley , Chambers , Burnham , and the other happy few conservatives at NR were far more outnumbered in 1955 , and that the institutional forces arrayed against them were far more daunting , than anything conservatives face today . And yet Buckley understood , as he put it in Up from Liberalism , that \u201c conservatism must be wiped clean of the parasitic cant that defaces it . \u201d\nCultures are shaped by incentives . The GOP has been grievously wounded and deformed by the refusal of conservatives , in and out of elective office , to lay down the correct incentives . By refusing to defend conservative dogma against \u201c supposedly \u201d racist and nativist forces , our dogma is being erased like the battlements of a sand castle when the tide comes in .\nAbout Rockwell : I did not mention it above because it was irrelevant to the point I was making . But I know that some will play Gotcha ! and point out that George Lincoln Rockwell briefly ( less than six months ) worked for \u2588\u2588\u2588 around the time of its founding . He had nothing to do with the editorial side of things \u2014 he was hired as a contractor to sell subscriptions on college campuses . When Rockwell \u2019 s anti-Semitism and Hitlerphilia manifested itself , Buckley condemned him . Years later , when the Liberty Lobby accused Buckley of having a close working relationship with Rockwell , Buckley sued and won .\nAnimal Update : Because I am here at my mom \u2019 s pad , I am hanging out with her very , very fancy cats .

And tending to an emotionally and physically exhausted 15-year-old took precedence. She went to bed at her grandma\u2019s house last night at 5:30. As of this writing (10:30 a.m.), she is still asleep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnimal Update: Because I am here at my mom\u2019s pad, I am hanging out with her very, very fancy cats. This is Fafoon, and she will not be trifled with. Paddington, meanwhile, is actually a very cheery and fun feline, but he has very strong views about selfies. I\u2019d show you a picture of Winston, the Scottish Fold, but he despises paparazzi. Meanwhile, Zo\u00eb and Pippa are doing great. Kirsten has taken them on some wonderful adventures this week. Would that we could all enjoy the simple pleasures of being a well-tended spaniel. I particularly love this picture. There was only moment of drama this week, when Pippa, frightened by a thunderstorm, got herself stuck under our enormous and enormously heavy bed frame. I will be home tomorrow to resume normal protocols.\n\nICYMI . . .\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nDude, where\u2019s my God?\n\nSarah Jeong, Schumpeter\u2019s child\n\nDavid French is right about Alex Jones\n\nStephen Colbert is (was) wrong about Trump and me\n\nTrump\u2019s kayfabe\n\nThe latest Ricochet GLoP Culture podcast\n\nMy magazine essay about They Live (paywall)\n\nIs Alex Jones our fault?\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nDebby\u2019s Friday links\n\nGoat Simulator IRL\n\nA low-speed chase\n\nDouble twin marriage\n\nFlorida Man achievement unlocked\n\nNew Ernest Hemingway short story being published\n\nRabid wolves attack helpless child\n\nChina\u2019s bikeshare graveyards\n\nHow 2,000-year-old roads predict modern prosperity\n\nD.
