    "content": "There will be a new House election in North Carolina \u2019 s Ninth Congressional District , after the state elections board ruled Thursday that a bizarre ballot tampering scheme had tainted the basic fairness of the November vote .\nThe new election would start with a new primary election , under a recently passed state law , to determine the Democratic and Republican candidates . On Election Day , Republican Mark Harris led Democrat Dan McCready by fewer than 1,000 votes , but his win was never certified by the state after allegations of electoral misconduct became public . The timing for the new elections will be announced soon .\nOver the past four days , state investigators laid out in detail an \u201c unlawful , \u201d \u201c coordinated , \u201d and well-funded plot to tamper with absentee ballots in a US House election that remained uncalled more than three months after Election Day \u2014 finally bringing some clarity to one of the strangest election scandals in recent memory .\nState investigators established their theory of the case \u2014 that a Republican operative , Leslie McCrae Dowless , directed a coordinated scheme to unlawfully collect , falsely witness , and otherwise tamper with absentee ballots \u2014 and workers who say they had assisted him in the scheme delivered damning testimony describing their activities . Dowless himself refused to testify , on the advice of his lawyer .\nOn Thursday afternoon , after four days of evidence indicating fraud and an attempt to conceal the scheme from state investigators , Harris himself told the state election board that he believed a new election should be called . The board voted to do so soon afterward .\nA top political consultant for Harris \u2019 s campaign and the candidate \u2019 s own son had given their own remarkable testimony about the decision to hire Dowless . The consultant , Andy Yates , and John Harris both insisted Harris did not know what Dowless was doing and proved too trusting about the operative \u2019 s claims . Yet John Harris did say that he had warned his father that Dowless \u2019 s prior work on absentee ballots seemed like it could be illegal , a warning that went unheeded by the candidate . His testimony left Mark Harris in tears .\nThe board \u2014 made up of three Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 had reconvened after Democratic Gov . Roy Cooper named new members amid an unrelated legal dispute . They reviewed the evidence in the case over two days and then voted to call for a new election at the hearing \u2019 s conclusion .\nUnder state law , the board is able to call a new election if the basic fairness of the election was tainted . It doesn \u2019 t matter whether the number of votes in dispute would have been enough to swing the outcome .\nFor the House , the question is whether the Democratic majority will grow by one more seat or not . But the voters in the Ninth District will get the chance at a clean election after the state \u2019 s investigation brought to light a convoluted scheme to collect , witness , and tamper with absentee ballots in this district along the state \u2019 s southern border .\nIt \u2019 s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina : Anybody can request one , and at the end of every day before the election , state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted .\nA campaign could check that file every morning to know how many registered Republican , Democratic , and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot .\n\u201c From a mechanics point of view , this is a gold mine of information for candidates and their campaign , \u201d Bitzer told me previously .\nThat treasure trove of data would have given Dowless and the people he worked with a detailed picture of how many absentee ballots were coming in every day from Republican , Democratic , and unaffiliated voters \u2014 and , by extension , how many absentee ballots they needed from their voters to keep pace with the Democrats . Indeed , some of the workers who testified before the board Monday described Dowless discussing with other operatives how many votes were needed to match the Democratic turnout and informing Harris that the early vote totals looked promising for the Republican .\nInvestigators working on behalf of the North Carolina election board started Monday \u2019 s hearing by laying out the contours of the ballot tampering scheme , which they say was led by Dowless , and then questioned Lisa Britt and several other women who worked for him . Britt , who was Dowless \u2019 s stepdaughter for a time and said she remained close to him , said she believed that she and Dowless had done something wrong . But she insisted more than once that the GOP candidate , Harris , had not been privy to the plot .\nBetween the opening statement from investigators , Britt \u2019 s testimony and corroborating testimony from other witnesses , here is what we learned about the alleged ballot tampering scheme :\nState investigators said Dowless had used absentee ballot request forms for prior elections to \u201c pre-fill \u201d forms for the 2018 election and sent out workers to find the voters so they could sign the forms and request a ballot \u2014 they described this as \u201c Phase One . \u201d\nThe workers allegedly presented the forms to Dowless and received a payment from him , based on how many they brought in , and then sent the forms to the board of elections .\nAt least 780 absentee request forms were allegedly submitted by Dowless or one of his workers .\nFor \u201c Phase Two \u201d of the operation , investigators said , Dowless sent out workers to collect the absentee ballots from voters .\nSome of the ballots the workers collected had not been signed by witnesses or had not been sealed and the workers again took those ballots to Dowless and received payment in return .\nDowless held on to the returned ballots and instructed workers to falsely sign as witnesses for some of the ballots he collected , according to investigators .\nTo avoid raising the suspicions of state officials , the ballots were mailed in small batches , from post offices near the voters \u2019 homes , and the workers made sure that the dates of their signatures and even the ink they used matched that of the voters .\nBritt affirmed much of the investigators \u2019 case in her testimony , testifying that she had collected ballots , that Dowless had instructed people to sign ballots they had actually not been there to witness , and that she had signed her mother \u2019 s name on some ballots so they would not raise suspicion from the state board .\nBritt testified that if the ballots were left unsealed and there were elections left blank , she would fill in some of the empty offices \u2014 again , this was done to avoid arousing suspicion from state election officials .
