    "content": "The first televised presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a bonanza for fact checkers . Here are some of the candidates ' statements and how they compare with the facts .\nClaim : Donald Trump repeated his insistence that he was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq , claiming Clinton 's assertions to the contrary were `` mainstream media nonsense put out by her '' .\nReality Check verdict : Trump did not publicly speak out against the war before it started . On 11 September 2002 , radio host Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported a potential invasion of Iraq . He replied : `` Yeah , I guess so '' . During the debate , he tried to explain that away by saying the comment had been made `` lightly '' . He said he had been arguing in private , to Fox News 's Sean Hannity , that war would destabilise the Middle East , but we have no evidence to support that so far . He did start to express doubts after the invasion .\nClaim : Clinton attacked Trump over his boasts about his business acumen . `` You know , Donald was very fortunate in his life and that 's all to his benefit , '' Clinton said . `` He started his business with $ 14m , borrowed from his father . ''\nReality Check verdict : Trump says he received a $ 1m loan from his real estate mogul father . He also got loan guarantees and money from his future inheritance and inherited a share of his father 's property holdings .\nClaim : Trump alleged that Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the `` gold standard '' of trade agreements . Clinton denied this but added : `` I did say I hoped it would be a good deal . ''\nReality Check verdict : We give this one to Trump . Clinton did more than express hope that the deal would turn out well and in a 2012 trip to Australia said it would be the `` gold standard '' : `` This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free , transparent , fair trade , the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field . ''\nClaim : Clinton said : `` People have looked at both of our plans , have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs . ''\nReality Check verdict : Clinton has made this claim before . It is based on an optimistic reading of a report by Moody 's Analytics , which says that most of the 10 million new jobs would be created anyway by an expanding economy . If all of Clinton 's economic policies became law - which the report says is unlikely - they would account for 3.2 million of the 10 million jobs . The same company analysed Trump 's plans and suggested they would tip the US into recession and lead to 3.5 million job losses - something strongly disputed by the Trump campaign .\nBut the two reports cover different time frames . The author Mark Zandi told CNN Money a more accurate comparison to the 10 million jobs created under Clinton would be 400,000 jobs lost under Trump , not 3.4 million .\nClaim : Trump has frequently tried to blame the rise of Islamic State militants on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . This is his latest attempt .\nReality Check verdict : Possibly the strangest claim of the night . Clinton is 68 years old . The so-called Islamic State can trace its roots back to 1999 , although it did not start referring to itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) until 2013 . Read more here .\nClaim : Clinton accused Trump of calling calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese . He insisted `` I did not say that '' .\nReality Check verdict : This claim relates to a 2012 tweet which Trump later said was a joke . He said : `` The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive . ''\nClaim : Clinton said race determines how people are treated in the criminal justice system .\nReality Check verdict : This is a tough one to prove as there are no figures on the percentage of crimes that result in arrest . What we do know is that black people are locked up five times more frequently than white people . African-American people make up about 13 % of the United States population . White people make up 64 % . But black people make up 40 % of the prison population , and white people 39 % . It does not mean that black people , who tend to live more in urban , heavily policed areas , are five times as likely to commit crime however .\nClinton also claimed that African American men are more likely to be killed by guns than other demographics , something that is largely borne out by the statistics .\nReality Check verdict : As so often with crime statistics it depends how you slice it . The murder rate in New York city is close to record lows but did increase slightly between 2014 and 2015 , according to FBI figures . But the very latest figures from the New York Police Department show murder rates are down 4 % on 2015 .\nMurder rates across the US as a whole went up 10.8 % in 2015 , the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971 , with a big spike in a handful of cities including Chicago , Washington DC and Baltimore .\nTrump also claimed that `` stop and frisk '' tactics `` worked very well in New York '' and brought crime rates down . This is hotly disputed by researchers and commentators . Violent crime rates have continued to decline in New York , as part of a long term trend , even though the number of `` stop and frisk '' searches has gone down dramatically in recent years . Research by Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University found indiscriminate searches had little effect on crime , although his research also found crime was reduced when police stopped and frisked civilians after observing someone acting violently , selling drugs or `` casing a joint '' .\nClaim : Trump says he ca n't release his tax returns because he is in the middle of a tax audit . He also says publishing them would not reveal much .\nClinton suggests he will never publish them as they might reveal he is not as rich as he says he is , does not pay Federal tax and does not give as much to charity as claimed .\nReality Check verdict : Being audited by the Internal Revenue Service does not prohibit the release of tax returns . They would reveal Trump 's annual income , how much he pays in tax and how much he gives to charity . Trump claims he has given $ 102m to charity in the past five years , but a Washington Post investigation could not find any cash donated by Trump 's businesses after 2008 . Trump 's actual wealth has been assessed by Forbes at $ 4.5bn , compared with the $ 10bn he claims .\nInterestingly , Trump has never provided evidence that he is actually under audit by the tax authorities . According to Associated Press , a letter released by his tax lawyers never used the word , merely describing his tax returns as under continuous review .",
