    "content": "The recent kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Nigeria is a dramatic and potentially tragic example of the fanaticism of Boko Haram and other Islamic militants operating along the seam between Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa .\nThe Boko Haram terrorists have developed paramilitary capabilities , and their conduct of operations not just in Nigeria \u2019 s Muslim north , but throughout the country , is steadily increasing .\nThe current hostage-taking is the largest and most violent example of their growing strength , though , sadly , far from the first . Since Nigeria is perhaps sub-Saharan Africa \u2019 s most important country , this is a matter of pressing interest for the United States . Nigeria \u2019 s population is approximately 174 million , almost two-thirds the size of the United States , and about one-fifth of Africa \u2019 s total .\nNonetheless , the growing terrorist threat across North Africa has received precious little attention in the United States .\nIn January 2013 , terrorists in Algeria affiliated with Al Qaeda struck a natural gas production facility near the town of In Amenas , holding over 800 people hostage . The terrorists executed some 40 foreigners before Algerian authorities re-established control , killing nearly 30 terrorists as the rest escaped . Because the incident occurred at the time of President Obama \u2019 s second inauguration , American press coverage was minimal .\nShortly thereafter , in Mali , terrorists \u2013 many formerly employed by Muammar Qaddafi in Libya \u2013 nearly took over the entire country . Only repeated military interventions by France in its former colony prevented an Islamist victory . The situation in Mali remains far from secure even today .\nAnd , of course , we still have not seen any retaliation against the growing terrorist threat in Libya to avenge the assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11 , 2012 . For anyone who wants to know \u201c what difference it makes \u201d to find and punish the Benghazi murderers , the lengthening list of terrorist attacks across North Africa , embodied in the current Boko Haram hostage-taking in Nigeria , is a more than sufficient answer .\nSimply put , the United States needs an effective counterterrorism strategy in North Africa , and we do not have one . Despite having created a separate African Command at the Pentagon , separating it from the European Command , inadequate attention has been given to the North African terrorist threat .\nThis lack of focus is not surprising , since the Obama administration itself has for five years insisted that the global war on terrorism was essentially over and won . Nothing could be further from reality .\nThe Nigerian government has not dealt effectively with Boko Haram , and other governments in the region also face severe constraints on their operational capabilities . Yet , the Nigeria \u2019 s failure has enormous political implications throughout northern Africa .\nIf Boko Haram \u2019 s reach and strength continue to grow , it is not impossible that Nigeria \u2019 s ethnically and religiously diverse population could face massive internal strife , and perhaps even split apart . The 1967 Biafra secession and subsequent civil war and humanitarian tragedy should remind us just how fragile Nigeria actually is .\nIf there is instability in Nigeria , and the Nigerian national government loses control over northern Nigeria because of it , it could become a haven for terrorist groups operating worldwide .
