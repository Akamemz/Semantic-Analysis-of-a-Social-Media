    "content": "A shockingly positive May jobs report has raised hopes of a faster recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession .\nEconomists had expected the unemployment rate to rise from a post-World War II record of 14.7 percent in April to Great Depression-era levels of 20 percent or higher . Instead , the economy added 2.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent .\n\u201c It indicates the recession is over and the recovery has begun , \u201d said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody \u2019 s Analytics .\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpMcBath , Handel to face off in Georgia House rematch Trump thanks George P. Bush for his support : 'Great honor ' Trump Jr. 's Mongolia hunting trip cost K in Secret Service protection MORE , who has built his case for reelection around the economy , was ecstatic over the news , giving a hastily scheduled Rose Garden speech in which he touted the numbers as \u201c a big step in our comeback . \u201d\nThe stunning gains were mainly due to the return of 2.7 million workers from temporary layoffs or furloughs , half of them reporting back to restaurants , bars and other businesses in the leisure and hospitality industry . The survey period for the May report came shortly after more than half of states began relaxing business restrictions , catching the first wave of reopenings .\nKeeping workers connected to their employers is crucial to a quick recovery , and experts see the swift end of some temporary layoffs as a strong start .\nEven so , 15.3 million workers haven \u2019 t returned from layoffs they believe will be temporary and it remains unclear how many of those temporary job losses will become permanent .\nThe number of permanent job losses in the U.S. also increased by 295,000 in May , raising questions about the durability of the rebound . And the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the unemployment rate would have been roughly 3 percentage points higher if not for an error in how some furloughed workers were classified .\nStill , the swift move in the right direction spurred hope among experts , investors and politicians seeking reelection .\n\u201c This is better than a \u2018 V , \u2019 this is a rocket ship , \u201d Trump said , referring to a speedy , V-shaped recovery that quickly erases the losses of a recession .\nStock markets skyrocketed following the news , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking 27,000 , the S & P 500 hovering at just 5 percent below its February peak , and the Nasdaq composite completely erasing the losses from the pandemic , hitting a new record high .\n\u201c I had expected that the job losses would continue and that the unemployment rate would be higher , so I was surprised , \u201d said Erica Groshen of Cornell University 's School of Industrial and Labor Relations , a former commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nFor weeks , data on initial unemployment claims has shown millions of new people applying for benefits , adding to the sense of growing joblessness .\n\u201c I think one way to understand this is that we \u2019 re going to have a lot of people who are on Unemployment Insurance for a fairly short time . So maybe we had a kind of churning , where people who got on it early on the process are already off it , \u201d Groshen said .\nThe data point to a quicker bounce back in states that began opening up their economies by early May , when the survey was taken . The report shows stark drops in people who were temporarily laid off and those who had dropped out of the labor force altogether , though the number of people working part-time didn \u2019 t see much of a change .\nBut Groshen said another important factor should not be overlooked .\n\u201c For me the main takeaway is actually that the policy steps that were taken were quite effective , \u201d she said .\nCongress has passed some $ 3.6 trillion in emergency relief to combat the coronavirus , including hundreds of billions in expanded unemployment insurance , stimulus checks , forgivable loans to small businesses that kept workers on the books , money to support potential loss-lending from the Federal Reserve , and some aid to state and local government\nDemocrats , who have passed another $ 3 trillion package in the House , fretted that the early turnaround would relieve pressure to pass further emergency funding at a critical moment .\n`` My worry is that these numbers will make the president , the Republican Senate , complacent , '' said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerSchumer on Trump 's tweet about 75-year-old protester : He 'should go back to hiding in the bunker ' Democrats unveil sweeping legislation in response to protests of police brutality Pelosi , Schumer kneel in silence for almost 9 minutes to honor George Floyd MORE ( D-N.Y. ) .\n\u201c The stimulus helped get the economy going . But we need a lot more or we could go right back into the ditch with unemployment expiring , \u201d he added .\nBenefits such as expanded unemployment are set to expire , and state and local governments , reeling from the pandemic response , are preparing to publish their annual budgets without additional federal aid .\n\u201c With more than 100,000 Americans tragically dead , 21 million still out of work and state and local budgets collapsing , now is the worst possible moment to take our foot off the gas , \u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSanders endorses Engel challenger in New York primary \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Morning Report - Dems , GOP already headed in different directions on policing reforms Biden , Democrats seek to shut down calls to defund police MORE ( D-Calif. ) said in response to the report .\nSome conservative groups have already begun calling for a halt to further spending plans .\n\u201c While the crisis is not over , Americans need employment opportunities , not unemployment incentives , \u201d said Rachel Greszler , a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation .\n\u201c Congress should slow down , learn from past stimulus failures , and fix policy mistakes that discourage work and economic recovery , \u201d she said .\nThe issue of $ 600 in additional weekly unemployment insurance is a particular sticking point , because it pushes unemployment pay higher than salaries for many low-income workers , which conservatives fear makes a return to work during the pandemic less attractive .\nBut economists have warned that the surprisingly good jobs report should not give people the false impression that the economy is on a fast road to recovery .\nFor one , some groups are far worse off .
