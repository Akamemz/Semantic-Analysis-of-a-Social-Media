It allowed tax incentives for scholarships to private schools , including religious ones . But the state court said that ran afoul of a state constitution provision forbidding public funds from going to religious institutions .\nIn what advocates called a landmark ruling , Roberts said the religious protections of the U.S. Constitution prevail . It holds implications for public funding of religious institutions in other areas and continues a recent pattern of the Supreme Court erasing stark lines in the separation of church and state .\nNelson Tebbe , a religious law expert at Cornell , said the ruling moves beyond previous constitutional questions . The court \u201c held not only that the Constitution does not prohibit a state from supporting religious schools , but also that it requires a state to include religious schools in any school choice program , \u201d he said .\nAnother pattern continued : the prominence of the chief justice in the most important decisions of the Supreme Court \u2019 s term . While he has formed a majority with liberals in previous cases striking down a Louisiana abortion law and stopping the Trump administration from dismantling a program protecting undocumented immigrants , he was joined in Tuesday \u2019 s opinion by the court \u2019 s four most consistent conservatives .\nThe decision was a big win for school choice advocates such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , who favor government support for students seeking faith-based education and called the ruling a \u201c turning point in the sad and static history of American education . \u201d\nPublic school advocates said such programs take away resources that should be used to improve those systems . National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said it will have a \u201c shameful and unacceptable \u201d impact on public education .\nThe Trump administration supported the challenge to the Montana court \u2019 s decision and hailed the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling .\nIt \u201c removes one of the biggest obstacles to better educational opportunities for all children , \u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement .\n\u201c The Trump Administration believes that school choice is a civil rights issue , and that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing school . \u201d\nRoberts was joined in the opinion by Justices Clarence Thomas , Samuel A. Alito Jr. , Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh .\nThe court \u2019 s liberals said that the Montana Supreme Court had eliminated any discrimination problems by ending the program and that their conservative colleagues were too anxious to fix a problem that no longer existed .\nThe parents who brought the case \u201c argue that the Free Exercise Clause requires a state to treat institutions and people neutrally when doling out a benefit \u2014 and neutrally is how Montana treats them in the wake of the state court \u2019 s decision , \u201d wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , joined by Justice Elena Kagan . \u201c Accordingly , the Montana Supreme Court \u2019 s decision does not place a burden on petitioners \u2019 religious exercise . \u201d\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said the court \u2019 s decision increases the risk of government entanglement in religion , with objecting taxpayers having to fund religious instruction .\n\u201c If , for 250 years , we have drawn a line at forcing taxpayers to pay the salaries of those who teach their faith from the pulpit , I do not see how we can today require Montana to adopt a different view respecting those who teach it in the classroom , \u201d Breyer wrote .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote separately that the ruling \u201c weakens this country \u2019 s longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both . \u201d\nRoberts responded that the Montana legislature did not want the program to end .\n\u201c The Montana Legislature created the scholarship program ; the Legislature never chose to end it , for policy or other reasons , \u201d he wrote . \u201c The program was eliminated by a court , and not based on some innocuous principle of state law . Rather , the Montana Supreme Court invalidated the program pursuant to a state law provision that expressly discriminates on the basis of religious status . \u201d\nAt issue was an initiative passed by the Montana legislature in 2015 that provided dollar-for-dollar tax credits up to $ 150 to those who donated to scholarship programs for low-income parents to send their children to private schools .\nThe program made no distinction as to whether parents could use the scholarships at religious or secular schools .
