The more general knowledge a student has , the better her chances .\nThe old tests , which varied from state to state , were generally easier to game \u2014 for example , by eliminating obviously wrong multiple choice answers . The new tests ask students to read more sophisticated passages and then cite evidence from them in their answers . That \u2019 s hard to do if you don \u2019 t have enough knowledge to understand the passages in the first place .\nThe advantages of a knowledge-rich curriculum aren \u2019 t just a matter of speculation . A foundation started by Mr. Hirsch in 1986 has developed just such a curriculum , Core Knowledge Language Arts , that is used in elementary schools across the country . A recent pilot program in New York City public schools showed that elementary students in schools that used C.K.L.A . outperformed their peers in reading , science and social studies .\nMore recently , we \u2019 ve seen evidence that a knowledge-focused curriculum can lead to better results on Common Core-aligned tests , which New York began using two years ago .
