Any move to remove U.S. troops from potential harm \u2019 s way fits with his end goal .\nMoreover , he has also displayed a readiness to make foreign policy decisions off-the-cuff and based on his own gut instincts \u2013 even if against the advice of his national security circle , as seems to be the case here .\nBut the withdrawal \u2013 oddly announced in a late Sunday White House statement , after an earlier call Mr. Trump had with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 also raises questions about U.S. commitments to a longtime military ally and about the formulation and reliability of U.S. national security policy .\nThe U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were instrumental in defeating the Islamic State in northern Syria . But the Kurds \u2019 aspirations for regional autonomy have complicated the relations between the U.S. and its NATO ally Turkey , which sees the Kurds \u2019 presence on its border as a threat and labels their fighters terrorists .\nConcerned that the Kurds face an imminent Turkish onslaught with U.S. forces out of the way , both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders expressed alarm Monday over the president \u2019 s decision and what looked like the abandonment of longtime U.S. goals in Syria .\nThe uproar prompted a White House phone briefing with reporters late Monday afternoon , in which a senior administration official insisted the president \u2019 s decision was neither abandonment of the Kurds nor the U.S. withdrawal of its last troops from Syria \u2013 something the president himself alluded to in tweets Monday .\nAccording to the official , President Erdo\u011fan made it clear in Sunday \u2019 s phone call that Turkey \u2019 s military operation into northern Syria was imminent \u2013 and as a result , the president decided to reassign U.S. special forces there to other areas away from potential fighting . Pentagon sources said about 100 U.S. personnel were relocated .\n\u201c For anyone to characterize [ the president \u2019 s decision to move those troops ] as somehow being a green light for a massacre is irresponsible and doesn \u2019 t comport with the reality , \u201d the senior official said .\nSome U.S. policy analysts were quick to defend the essence of Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision , if not the manner in which it was made .\n\u201c The U.S. military should be quickly withdrawn from Syria \u2013 in fact , it should have entirely left already , \u201d says Benjamin Friedman , policy director for Defense Priorities , a Washington group that argues for a strong defense posture that avoids U.S. entanglement in foreign conflicts .\nAs for the Kurds , Mr. Friedman adds that \u201c the U.S. can not guarantee the safety of the Kurds short of war with Turkey . The interests of the Kurds should not take precedence over U.S. interests ... nor be used as a pretext to keep troops in Syria forever . \u201d\nBut others \u2013 among them some of the most faithful advocates for Mr. Trump \u2019 s foreign policy \u2013 warn that the Syria decision will weaken the U.S. image as a reliable ally and only buoy its adversaries in the region \u2013 from Iran to the remnants of ISIS that remain in the region and which have recently shown renewed signs of life .\n\u201c President Trump \u2019 s decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria \u2019 s border with Turkey and abandon the Kurds is a betrayal of a key partner in our fight against ISIS , \u201d Sen.
