Sullivan had ordered the State Department to talk with the FBI and see what sort of information could be recovered from Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email server , which her lawyer has said she turned over to the Justice Department over the summer .\n\u201c At this time , consistent with long-standing Department of Justice and FBI policy , we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation , nor are we in a position to provide additional information at this time , \u201d FBI General Counsel James A. Baker wrote in a letter dated Monday \u2014 a week after the deadline the Justice Department had set for the FBI to reply .\nJudicial Watch , a conservative public interest law firm that is pursuing at least 16 open records cases seeking emails from Mrs. Clinton and her top aides , said at this point it \u2019 s not even clear what Mrs. Clinton provided , since all that \u2019 s been made public at this point are the former secretary of state \u2019 s public comments and some assertions , made through her lawyer , to the State Department .\nJudicial Watch is prodding the courts to try to delve more deeply into Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails , and the group said a number of questions persevere about both Mrs. Clinton and top aides such as Huma Abedin , who did public business on an account tied to the server Mrs. Clinton maintained .\n\u201c We still do not know whether the FBI \u2014 or any other government agency for that matter \u2014 has possession of the email server that was used by Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin to conduct official government business during their four years of employment at the State Department , \u201d Judicial Watch said .\n\u201c We also do not know whether the server purportedly in the possession of the FBI \u2014 an assumption based on unsworn statements by third parties \u2014 is the actual email server that was used by Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin to conduct official government business during their four years of employment at the State Department or whether it is a copy of such an email server . Nor do we know whether any copies of the email server or copies of the records from the email server exist , \u201d the group said in its own court filing Monday afternoon .\nJudicial Watch did release more than 50 pages Monday of emails it obtained from Ms. Abedin \u2019 s account on Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s server , and said it was clear she was talking about \u201c sensitive \u201d topics that shouldn \u2019 t have been discussed on an insecure account .\nMany of those were details of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s movements overseas , such as hotels she was staying at .\n\u201c These emails Judicial Watch forced out through a federal lawsuit show that Huma Abedin used her separate clintonemail.com account to conduct the most sensitive government business , endangering not only her safety but the safety of Hillary Clinton and countless others , \u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .\nHe questioned what reason Ms. Abedin \u2014 who did maintain an account , [ email protected ] , on State.gov servers \u2014 would have for using the other account for important business . Mrs. Clinton said she kept only one account , the one on the clintonemail.com server , because it was more convenient , but that reasoning does not appear to apply to Ms. Abedin .\nThe State Department is making all of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails public under order of Judge Rudolph Contreras . But the department has said it won \u2019 t make all of the emails public from Ms. Abedin or other top Clinton aides Cheryl Mills or Philippe Reines . Instead the department only plans to release those messages specifically requested in open records demands .\nMrs. Clinton turned over about 30,000 email messages in December , while her aides turned over more than 100,000 pages between them , with the final set only being returned , by Ms. Abedin , earlier this month , the department said in court filings .\nWithout those documents in hand , the State Department has been unable to do full and complete searches in response to subpoenas , congressional inquiries or Freedom of Information Act requests .\nThe State Department has asked for dozens of cases to be put on hold while it tries to get a single judge to coordinate all of its searches in more than two dozen cases .
