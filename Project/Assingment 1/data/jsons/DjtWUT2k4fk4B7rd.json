It was very different from any other campaign in that it required almost none of the one-on-one outreach that usually goes on for months in the small early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire with town halls and visits to diners and living rooms . Trump believed he was above that sort of thing when he said at a rally , as captured on a Twitter post :\nDon \u2019 t forget that when I ran in the primaries , when I was in the primaries , everyone said you can \u2019 t do that in New Hampshire , you can \u2019 t do that . You have to go and meet little groups , you have to see \u2014 cause I did big rallies , 3-4-5K people would come . . . and they said , `` Wait a minute , Trump can never make it , because that \u2019 s not the way you deal with New Hampshire , you have to go to people \u2019 s living rooms , have dinner , have tea , have a good time . '' I think if they ever saw me sitting in their living room they \u2019 d lose total respect for me . They \u2019 d say , I \u2019 ve got Trump in my living room , this is weird .\nIn Trump 's view , people do n't respect real leaders if they `` have tea '' with them . They need to see them speaking behind a podium or perhaps from above on a royal balcony . It 's uncomfortable for the plebes to be on his level , you see .\nLikewise , Trump held very few town halls during the primaries and those he did were generally moderated by friendly supporters and he was only asked questions by fans . The few that were n't were rather disastrous . For instance , in a CNN town hall forum with Anderson Cooper last March , Trump made a statement that sent chills down the spines of millions of people all over the world . Cooper asked him about nuclear proliferation and after vamping in his usual disjointed fashion , Trump came out with this startling comment :\nCooper : So if you said , Japan , yes , it 's fine , you get nuclear weapons , South Korea , you as well , and Saudi Arabia says we want them , too ? Trump : Can I be honest with you ? It 's going to happen , anyway . It 's going to happen anyway . It 's only a question of time . They 're going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely . But you have so many countries already , China , Pakistan , you have so many countries , Russia , you have so many countries right now that have them . Now , would n't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons ?\nAnd when Cooper pressed him further by asking if he did n't think there was a benefit to the United States ' guaranteeing a secure world with as few nuclear weapons as possible Trump replied , `` There 's a benefit but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States because that 's what 's happening . We ca n't afford it . It 's very simple . ''\nTrump had made many shocking remarks before about committing war crimes and torturing and killing families of terrorist suspects among other things . But this exchange may have been the moment when it finally sank in just how dangerous his ideas really are . It 's nearly impossible to believe that anyone , much less an American presidential candidate , would think that there is any higher priority than preventing nuclear war , but there you have it . He says it 's simple : `` We ca n't afford '' it .\nAt another town hall forum with MSNBC 's Chris Matthews a few days later , Trump once again revealed the disturbing way his mind works . Matthews pushed him on abortion rights , which Trump had clearly not fully considered until that moment :\nMatthews : `` Do you believe in punishment for abortion , yes or no as a principle ? '' Trump : `` The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment . '' Matthews : `` For the woman ? '' Trump : `` Yes , there has to be some form . ''\nTrump had not been schooled in anti-abortion obfuscation on that topic so he blurted out the logical conclusion of the argument . In his debate this week , his zealous anti-choice running mate Mike Pence denied that he or Trump would ever punish a woman for making the `` heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy '' even though Pence 's Indiana is a state that famously jailed a woman for a self-induced abortion . ( Just last month the Indiana Court of Appeals overturned her 20-year prison sentence for `` feticide , '' ruling that state law does n't actually allow a woman to be convicted for her abortion . ) Any woman who trusts either one of these men on this issue is being willfully naive .\nOn Thursday night , Trump held a short town hall forum in New Hampshire , which had been billed as a trial run for Sunday 's meeting in St. Louis . He adamantly denied that he was practicing , claiming that his rival Hillary Clinton is n't preparing either and is actually resting up so she 'll have enough energy for the debate on Sunday . In fact , he indicated that he thinks preparing for the debate is demeaning in some way :\nIt 's so disconcerting when you hear \u2014 even tonight they said , `` Donald Trump is going to New Hampshire to practice for Sunday . This has nothing to do with Sunday . It 's like they make you into , like a child . . . . Forget debate prep .\nTrump does n't like to take direction , apparently . After the disaster of his last debate , that 's a foolish decision . He 's going to be sadly disappointed if he expects the questions from the audience to be the kind of softballs he got from his ecstatic followers last night such as `` What is one of your earliest memories as a child and why do you think it stands out ? '' and `` What would you say to convince Hispanics who were deceived by Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and the biased media to vote for you ? '' ( Answering that second one , he informed the crowd that in Nevada the Hispanics prefer to be called Latinos . Seriously . )\nThese general election town halls involve a whole other level of performance , requiring the candidates to listen and show empathy to average people in the audience , respond to the moderators and volley back and forth with their opponent . Even a self-described genius and practiced TV celebrity like Trump may not have a natural talent for it .
