It passed the state 's Senate a day earlier .\n`` A measure that restores confidence in our election process and ensures voters are who they say they are is a no-brainer -- and nearly three-quarters of North Carolinians agree , '' said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger . `` This bill will bring North Carolina in line with the majority of other states that already require voter ID . ''\nIn the past two years , at least 11 states have approved laws requiring voters to show identification at voting booths .\nBut critics slammed it as an effort to disenfranchise poor , minority and disabled voters\nIt `` attacks democracy at its core '' by making it harder for eligible voters , the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina said .\n`` Many of these restrictions , such as eliminating pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds , and disallowing use of college IDs at the polls , will severely discourage young people from participating in elections , '' the group said in a statement .\n`` Others , such as shortening early voting and making it more difficult to set up satellite polling stations will be extremely burdensome for elderly and disabled voters who rely on such methods to cast their votes . ''\nIt listed what it described as `` harsh provisions '' in the measure , including eliminating same-day voter registration , shortening early voting and eliminating state-mandated voter registration drives .\nProponents of the bill say it will stop voter fraud , asserting that having a valid , government-issued photo identification is a reasonable , modern-day necessity .\nA poll this year showed that more than 72 % of North Carolina residents support requiring voters to show photo ID before being casting their ballot , according to Berger .\nLast month , the Supreme Court voted to halt the enforcement requirements of the Voting Rights Act . Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required some states with a history of voter discrimination to get `` precleared '' by the federal government before making any changes to voting laws .
