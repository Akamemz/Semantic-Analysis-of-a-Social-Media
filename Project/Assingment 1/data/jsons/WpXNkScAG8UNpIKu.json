    "content": "Cleveland ( CNN ) Open discord and revolt broke out on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday as GOP officials crushed an attempt to change party rules , a maneuver that could have embarrassed presumptive nominee Donald Trump .\nIn a highly unusual show of disunity and anger on the floor of a modern party convention , a group of states tried to force a state-by-state roll call vote on the rules of the convention . The rebellion apparently caught Trump 's campaign team by surprise , and his lieutenants were seen frantically whipping votes on the floor to squelch the effort amid scenes of deepening disarray .\nThe dramatic scenes that unfolded around a normally routine procedure in passing the convention rules effectively turned into the last stand of party forces who had opposed the billionaire in the contentious Republican primary . Those holdouts were not trying to deprive Trump of the nomination -- in the knowledge they did n't have the votes .\nBut their protest , which highlighted antipathy toward Trump in some parts of the party , may also turn out to have been one of the opening salvos of the Ted Cruz 2020 campaign , as it was driven by several of the Texas senator 's most prominent supporters who were keen to make the battlefield more favorable for conservatives in future Republican primaries .\nBackers of the effort said they would continue to protest Tuesday , when delegates are expected to formally make Trump their nominee .\n`` This race is n't over and I 'm running to the finish line , '' Kendal Unruh , a Colorado delegate who is leading the Free the Delegates effort , told reporters on the floor Monday night .\nThe tumult of the afternoon receded by the evening as delegates heard from a prime-time lineup of speakers who addressed national security issues . Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani gave an especially impassioned speech that brought many Republicans in the arena to their feet .\nThe afternoon furor erupted when Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack , who was serving as convention chair , put the rules for the convention to a voice vote , and amid a chorus of boos and cheers from anti-Trump supporters declared those in favor of the motion had prevailed , while apparently ignoring objections from several state delegations on the cacophonous floor of the convention .\nWomack then walked off the stage , amid chants of `` roll call , roll call '' by protesters , a chorus that was quickly met by loud counter chants of `` Trump , '' `` Trump '' from the presumptive nominee 's supporters .\n`` I have never seen the floor abandoned like that , '' said Utah Sen. Mike Lee , a key Cruz supporter as delegates on both sides of the row tried to work out of happen , amid roughly 10 minutes of uncertainty in which a jazz band played on stage , amid scenes of seething anger and confusion on the convention floor .\nIn one show of anger , Virginia 's Ken Cuccinelli threw his credentials on the floor , frustrated that the chair was not allowing a full roll call vote .\nAt one stage , the Colorado delegation walked out of the convention hall .\nWhen , Womack returned to the stage and ran the voice vote for a second time -- and again declared `` In the opinion of the chair the aye 's have it '' hyphen several delegates did manage to lodge objections .\nWomack explained that seven states were required to demonstrate a majority of their delegates wanted a roll call vote . While those backing a vote believed they had achieved that number by filing nine petitions , Womack told the convention that three states had subsequently withdrawn their petitions for a roll call vote , meaning there were not sufficient votes to force such a roll call vote .\nEven had there been a roll call vote , the Trump forces would likely have prevailed since the billionaire managed to win a majority of delegates in the GOP primary . The Trump forces were also backed by Republican National Committee officials in a sign of new coordination between the insurgent candidate and the institutional party establishment .\nTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the roll call push `` was not about Trump . ''\n`` It would have been a meaningless gesture , '' Manafort said . `` We knew the result , everybody knew the result and it would have affected the schedule for tonight so it was n't something that was a wise choice .
