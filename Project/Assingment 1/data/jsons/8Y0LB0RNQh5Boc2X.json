''\nOnce a political adversary , Bill Clinton tonight went to bat for the president , playing the dual parts of professor and preacher , firing up the crowd and explaining just how Obama has succeeded in working to fix a flailing economy .\nClinton strode to the podium to the strains of his old presidential campaign theme song `` Do n't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow , '' and a roar of applause from Democrats who remember the boom times of his two administrations .\n`` I want to nominate a man cool on the outside but burning for America on the inside .... I want Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States and I proudly nominate him as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party , '' Clinton told the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte , N.C .\nHe complimented Obama for his ability to work with those who ran against him , saying Obama appointed several people to top jobs who had supported Clinton 's wife Hillary Clinton during their bitter battle for the Democratic presidential nomination four years ago .\n`` Heck , he even appointed Hillary , '' Clinton said . Hillary Clinton is Obama 's secretary of state .\nArticulating the successes of the Obama administration in 30 minutes more concisely and energetically than the Obama campaign has in six months , Clinton said President Obama 's policies were working to fix the economy .\n`` I understand the challenge we face . I know many Americans are still angry and frustrated with the economy . Though employment is growing , banks are beginning to lend and even housing prices are picking up a bit , too many people do n't feel it , '' he said .\n`` No president \u2013 not me or any of my predecessors -- could have repaired all the damage in just four years . But conditions are improving and if you 'll renew the president 's contract you will feel it , '' he said .\nThe Romney campaign has made a point to ask voters if they are better off today than they were four years ago . Clinton twice answered Romney 's question head on and in the affirmative .\n`` Are we better off than we were when he took office , with an economy in free fall , losing 750,000 jobs a month ? The answer is yes , '' he roared .\nClinton celebrated Obama 's signature healthcare law , pointing out that more 3 million young people are now insured and that health care spending has grown under 4 percent for first time in 50 years .\nClick here for continuous live streaming coverage of the democratic national convention\n`` So are we all better off because President Obama fought for [ health care reform ] and passed it , '' Clinton asked . `` You bet we are , '' he answered to applause .\nClinton attacked GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan , architect of the Republican budget plan , for being disingenuous last week at the Republican National Convention .\n`` When Congressman Ryan looked into the TV camera and attacked President Obama 's 'biggest coldest power play ' in raiding Medicare , I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . You see , that $ 716 billion is exactly the same amount of Medicare savings Congressman Ryan had in his own budget , '' he said .\n`` It takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did , '' Clinton said to laughs and cheers .\nClinton headlined the second night of the Democratic National Convention and he officially nominated Obama , a job typically performed by the nominee 's running mate .\nObama traveled to Charlotte to hear Clinton praise and nominate him . The president stayed in the White House with his two daughters on Tuesday night to watch his wife Michelle give an emotional speech backing his character and his presidency .\nThough Clinton and Obama have sparred in the past , especially during the 2008 Democratic primaries that pitted Obama against Hillary Clinton , the Obama campaign bet that the former president , a Democrat who oversaw nearly a decade of economic prosperity , will remind voters of what having a Democrat in the White House can mean for their wallets .\n`` In Tampa the Republican argument against the president 's re-election was pretty simple : We left him a total mess , he has n't finished cleaning it up yet , so fire him and put us back in , '' he said .\n`` I like the argument for President Obama 's re-election a lot better . He inherited a deeply damaged economy , put a floor under the crash , began the long hard road to recovery , and laid the foundation for a more modern , more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs , vibrant new businesses , and lots of new wealth for the innovators , '' he said .\nClinton also said that a vote for Obama represents a vote for doing what is best for the country , not just for oneself .\n`` The most important question is , what kind of country do you want to live in ? If you want a you're-on-your-own , winner-take-all society , you should support the Republican ticket . If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility -- a we're-all-in-this-together society -- you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden , '' he said .\nClinton 's speech marks the apex of a previously rocky relationship with Obama . When Obama ran against his wife Hillary Clinton in 2008 for the Democratic nomination , Bill Clinton often jabbed Obama on the stump , even calling his campaign a `` fairy tale .

''\nGOP vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan , campaigning today in Iowa , said Clinton would do little more than deliver `` a great rendition of how good things were in the 1990s . But we 're not going to hear much about how things have been in the last four years . ''\nLoyalists defended the campaign 's decision to parade out Clinton tonight .\n`` A former president who is very popular who can explain about the policies and the parallel tracks the two presidents have had in the sense of investing in education , investing in research and development , alternative energy and green energy and a responsible way of balancing the budget , '' Rahm Emanuel , the mayor of Chicago who served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations said today on `` Good Morning America . ''\n`` I think he can do nothing but help and the notion that Newt is going to give our party strategic advice , no thank you , '' he said .\nClinton , whose administration was marred by a sex scandal and impeachment trial , is more popular today than most public officials .\nDemocrats hope that popularity will rub off on Obama , who according to a new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll , has the lowest favorability rating of any incumbent president entering a convention .\nThroughout the evening , party loyalists and leaders addressed the convention in support of President Obama .\n`` To those like Mitt Romney who want to take us backwards , let 's send a strong message in November : as we say in Brooklyn , `` Fuhgeddaboutit , '' said New York Sen.

Are you ready to fight for good jobs and a strong middle class ? Are you ready to work for a level playing field ? Are you ready to prove to another generation of Americans that we can build a better country and a newer world , '' she asked .\nThe convention met with brief controversy this afternoon .
