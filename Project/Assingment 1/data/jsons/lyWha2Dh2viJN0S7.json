White House officials do not deny that the intelligence reached the Oval Office , but say it was not confirmed and so was not discussed directly with the president .\nIn early May a classified CIA update for officers across U.S. intelligence agencies and others with security clearance reportedly cited evidence of a Russian program suspected of paying Taliban-linked militias to kill American and coalition troops in Afghanistan .\nThe military and intelligence agencies were investigating whether the bounty program might have played a part in an April 2019 roadside bombing near Bagram Air Base in which three Marine reservists were killed . The United States had evidence \u2013 in the form of a half-million dollars in cash found in a Seal Team 6 raid of a Taliban hideout \u2013 that bounties had already been paid .\nAnd intelligence from captured Taliban fighters spurred the U.S. to investigate a funding channel connecting money handlers in Afghanistan with sources in Russia .\nInformation on the alleged Russian bounty program had already been included in a President \u2019 s Daily Brief , or PDB , in late February , according to reporting this week in The New York Times .\nBut the inclusion of Russia \u2019 s bounty plan more than two months later in the CIA update , called the Wire , is raising questions among some former intelligence officers and national security experts : Was it just bureaucratic issues that caused the delay ? Did new and better sourcing materialize over those two months to warrant the broader dissemination ?\nAnd why was the CIA , which compiles the Wire , acting at that point to disseminate something of such gravity to a broader audience ?\nMoreover , the wider dissemination of information on the bounty program along with the hints of sharp differences over it between the Trump administration and parts of the intelligence community reflect what some say is a debilitating lack of consensus in the U.S. government on Russia .\nAs the U.S. squabbles over how to handle relations with America \u2019 s longtime ideological and geopolitical adversary , these voices caution , Vladimir Putin is cannily exploiting the divisions to further his goals vis-a-vis the U.S. Those include weakening America \u2019 s democratic system and exacerbating social divisions . For Mr. Putin , who aims to reassert Russia as a global power , damaging U.S. standing in and commitment to regions where American and Russian interests collide \u2013 Eastern Europe , Central Asia , the Middle East , and Afghanistan \u2013 remains a top priority .\nBut others say that a broad consensus on Russia that goes back to the Cold War is , in fact , still in place \u2013 everywhere but at the very top .\n\u201c There is actually a fairly large consensus about the challenge Russia poses and the way the U.S. should respond , and I would say that consensus stretches from the intelligence community and many national security officials to much of Congress , \u201d says Andrea Kendall-Taylor , a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in the National Intelligence Council .\n\u201c And then there \u2019 s a huge gap , \u201d she adds , \u201c between that consensus and the person at the very top . \u201d\nTom Brenner/Reuters/File President Donald Trump delivers remarks to U.S. troops during an unannounced visit to Bagram Air Base , Afghanistan , November 28 , 2019 .\nIt is that gap , a feature of President Donald Trump \u2019 s tenure from the beginning \u2013 the intelligence community finding substantial evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 elections , and the president dismissing such conclusions as a \u201c hoax \u201d \u2013 that appears to be on display once again in the uproar over the suspected Russian bounty program .\nMr. Trump has had very little to say about the Russian plan , other than that he was never briefed on the issue .
