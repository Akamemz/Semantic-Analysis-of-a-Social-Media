    "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Supreme Court 's liberal wing on Thursday in temporarily blocking a Louisiana law that would have placed restrictions on abortion clinics , in the high court 's first major ruling on abortion since the confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh .\nThe ruling comes as Roberts , who was appointed by President George W. Bush , has increasingly and deliberately sought to present the federal judiciary as nonpartisan , amid a flurry of attacks from progressive groups arguing that the Supreme Court 's new conservative majority imperils the country . Last year , in a highly unusual statement , Roberts rebuked President Trump for criticizing partisanship in the federal judiciary .\nThe Louisiana law is virtually identical to a Texas measure the justices struck down three years ago by a 5-3 vote , shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia . Roberts dissented in that case , when he was not the deciding vote , and sided with the conservative minority that wanted to uphold the anti-abortion law -- making his decision on Thursday a significant reversal .\nThe justices decided in a 5-4 vote on Thursday , with Roberts as the swing vote , that they will not allow Louisiana to put into effect a law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals . The Supreme Court is set to issue a final ruling on the merits of the case later , and Thursday 's majority ruling did not spell out a rationale .\nIn the 2016 Texas case , the Supreme Court held that the admitting-privileges requirement \u201c provides few , if any , health benefits for women , poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions , and constitutes an \u2018 undue burden \u2019 on their constitutional right to do so .
