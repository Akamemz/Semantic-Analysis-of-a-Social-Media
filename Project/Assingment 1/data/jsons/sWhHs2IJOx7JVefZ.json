Ted Cruz , attempting to dismiss his disappointing finish as the result of dirty tricks but instead earning accusations that he \u2019 s \u201c whining . \u201d\nMr. Trump and his advisers said Mr. Cruz illegally colluded with a political action committee and is a \u201c Trojan horse \u201d for the GOP establishment \u2014 a comment the Texas senator waved aside , saying it was more proof that Mr. Trump is struggling and voters are tiring of his brash approach to politics .\n\u201c Donald has no solutions to the problems we \u2019 re facing , \u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters Wednesday . \u201c He likes to yell and scream and insult and curse , and his statement last night was consistent with that . \u201d\nHis post-Wisconsin accusations are just the latest instance of Mr. Trump excusing a poor performance by saying he was done in by dirty deeds . After losing the Iowa caucuses , Mr. Trump accused the Cruz campaign of frightening voters and spreading false rumors that fellow candidate Ben Carson was quitting the race .\nThe combative approach to a loss is yet another departure from standard political practice , said Rick Hasen , a political scientist at the University of California , Irvine School of Law .\n\u201c I think Trump is a terrible whiner , \u201d Mr. Hasen said . \u201c He \u2019 s always making excuses when he loses as opposed to being a gracious loser , which I think we \u2019 ve seen [ from ] Cruz and Clinton and Sanders and Rubio . Usually they [ say ] \u2018 I congratulate my opponent on a hard-fought race \u2019 \u2014 that \u2019 s a more typical thing that you hear . Not \u2018 they cheated , it \u2019 s not fair , there are too many people running against me \u2019 or anything like that , \u201d Mr. Hasen said .\nThe less-than-gracious approach to losing has so far worked for Mr. Trump , but he might have reached its limit , said Darrell West , vice president and director of Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution .\n\u201c He is entering a new phase of the campaign , and so there \u2019 s a question as to whether all the whining is catching up with him , \u201d Mr. West said .\nWhile still leading in the overall delegate race and in national polling , Mr. Trump has stumbled in recent weeks , suffering losses in contests in Utah and now Wisconsin , and watching as unfriendly delegates were chosen in Louisiana , North Dakota and Colorado .\nAt the same time , his campaign manager was charged with simple battery after an altercation with a reporter , and the candidate himself seemed to buck conservative orthodoxy on abortion and the role of the federal government in education and health care .\nAfter Mr. Cruz won Wisconsin with 48 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump \u2019 s 35 percent , the Trump campaign lashed out in a statement late Tuesday saying he was \u201c a Trojan horse \u201d being used by the GOP establishment to stop the Trump train .\nThe Trump campaign also accused Mr. Cruz of collusion with a political action committee \u2014 a move that , if true , would be illegal .\nBarry Bennett , a senior adviser to the Trump campaign , elaborated on Wednesday , saying that the violation stemmed from Mr. Cruz attending an event hosted by a pro-Cruz super PAC .\n\u201c They set up an event , paid for by the super PAC , and he comes and gives a speech . It \u2019 s total coordination , \u201d Mr. Bennett said on MSNBC . \u201c They then film it and turn it into commercials . I mean , it \u2019 s too cute by half . \u201d\nThe Trusted Leadership PAC , however , said it followed all laws , and said Mr. Trump \u2019 s accusations were baseless .\n\u201c It is unbecoming for a presidential candidate and his surrogates to continue to make ridiculous accusations , \u201d said Chip Roy , executive director of the group .\nMr. Roy \u2019 s PAC isn \u2019 t the only one to work closely with a candidate this election \u2014 though what exactly constitutes \u201c coordination \u201d under Federal Election Commission guidelines is a subject that \u2019 s been hotly debated .\nThe FEC has issued guidance that candidates can attend such super PAC events but only solicit funds of up to $ 5,000 at them , said Paul S.
