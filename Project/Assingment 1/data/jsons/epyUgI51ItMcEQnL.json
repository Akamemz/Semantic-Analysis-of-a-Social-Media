There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nMany note that \u201c Biden \u2019 s opposition to [ marijuana ] legalization\u2026 puts him at odds with the great majority of Democrats , 75-plus percent of whom back legalization . Biden \u2019 s opposition even puts him at odds with the median Republican , with polls showing that even a majority of Republicans support legalization . Politically , then , legalization should be low-hanging fruit \u2026 Yet Biden is not quite there\u2026 It \u2019 s an especially bad look for Biden . He has a long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies \u2014 not just supporting but actually writing many of the laws in the 1980s and \u2019 90s that helped shape America \u2019 s modern war on drugs . For Biden to hang on to marijuana prohibition , then , just reinforces one of the major concerns that criminal justice reformers like Booker have about him. \u201d German Lopez , Vox\nOthers note that \u201c [ Warren ] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has . She has also provided more overall policy detail , including on the taxes she would raise , than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg . And her Medicare plan comes much , much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts . I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas\u2026 The biggest weakness of Warren \u2019 s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system . Warren would not let people opt into Medicare , a wildly popular idea . She would force them to join\u2026 she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon. \u201d David Leonhardt , New York Times\nDated but relevant : \u201c Food stamps are now the only form of public assistance available to many struggling families during hard times : when their jobs don \u2019 t pay enough , when they face eviction , or when they experience health problems and other emergencies . These hardships can strike anyone : 1 in 5 Americans uses SNAP at some point in their lives\u2026 \u201c If the government wants to make food-assistance programs like SNAP obsolete , it needs to address the real problems in our economy that make it difficult for families to afford food : things like miserly wages , expensive housing , exorbitant health care costs and inadequate support for the unemployed . Until those changes are made , the least we can do is expand and bolster our existing food-assistance programs . Otherwise , more children and adults in our affluent country will go hungry. \u201d Sarah Bowen , Sinikka Elliott , and Joslyn Brenton , Politico\n\u201c Certain tweaks could boost the workforce . Cutting food stamps is not one of them\u2026 what \u2019 s striking is that the Trump proposal comes despite the absence of a glaring mismatch between the number of people in poverty and the number receiving SNAP . In fact , there appears to be a pretty close correspondence between the two : Roughly 38 million people live in poverty and roughly 38 million get SNAP , according to government data. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c Though helping or encouraging people to experience the \u2018 dignity of work \u2019 is a laudable goal\u2026 experts I spoke to say there is little evidence that food stamp receipt discourages work . Most food-stamp beneficiaries already have jobs ; among those who don \u2019 t , or who don \u2019 t work sufficient hours , it is difficult to believe that the only thing keeping them from meeting this requirement is that it doesn \u2019 t suck enough to be poor\u2026 \u201c The population affected by this new rule , after all , involves the neediest \u2014 on average , they make just 18 percent of the poverty line \u2014 so it \u2019 s not as though food stamps enable them to live a life of comfort and convenience . Especially when you consider that their average monthly SNAP benefits are $ 165 , or about $ 1.83 per meal\u2026 the Trump administration is pushing people off the rolls and making it more difficult for state policymakers to respond the next time there is a sudden spike in unemployment . Which means Trump officials aren \u2019 t just exporting anti-poor antipathy to the states ; they \u2019 re exporting Washington \u2019 s policy gridlock , too. \u201d Catherine Rampell , Washington Post\n\u201c Supporters of the requirements often claim to be helping poor people access \u2018 the dignity of work , \u2019 meaning that it \u2019 s inherently more satisfying to get paid for work than to depend on public support . That may well be true , provided your boss isn \u2019 t abusive and your work conditions are safe and , at the end of the month , your paycheck covers your expenses and maybe even leaves a bit left to save for the future . But you won \u2019 t hear those people talking about the \u2018 dignity of work \u2019 when it comes to organizing workers into unions that protect them from abusive management or unsafe conditions . Nor do they pipe up in favor of the \u2018 the dignity of a living wage. \u2019 In fact , the people who favor work requirements near universally oppose unions and minimum wage hikes\u2026 \u201c Some , probably very small fraction of the people who would lose food stamps probably don \u2019 t need need them . Instead , they are getting small payments that help them get enough to eat in the richest country on earth while also paying rent and maybe even ( horrors ! ) buying some stuff that wasn \u2019 t absolutely necessary . But some of the people \u2014 likely a far greater number of people \u2014 who \u2019 d lose food stamp payments really do need those benefits to get themselves and their families enough to eat\u2026 When it came to tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy , Trump and Republicans felt the nation \u2019 s finances were firm enough to give up more than $ 1,500,000,000,000 . When it \u2019 s time to spend a fraction of that to help poor people eat , that \u2019 s when the well has supposedly run dry. \u201d Patrick Reis , Rolling Stone\nThe right supports the rule limiting waivers , arguing that it is necessary to return to the original intentions of the law and prevent states from gaming the system .\nThe right supports the rule limiting waivers , arguing that it is necessary to return to the original intentions of the law and prevent states from gaming the system .\nSen. Mike Lee ( R-UT ) writes , \u201c When welfare reform first inserted work requirements into our welfare system in 1996 , some on the Left predicted doom for America \u2019 s most vulnerable families\u2026 [ but ] Between 1996 and 2000 , single-mother welfare caseloads fell by 53 % , their employment rate increased by 10 percentage points , and their poverty rate fell by 10 % \u2026 The number of SNAP recipients used to rise during recessions and then quickly fall as the economy recovered . But due to eligibility loopholes instituted under President Barack Obama , that didn \u2019 t happen after the most recent recession . A full ten years after the recession ended in 2009 , the share of the U.S. population receiving SNAP is 40 % higher now than when the recession began in 2007 . \u201d\n\u201c The 1996 welfare reform proved the effectiveness of [ work requirements ] . And if Congress disagrees , it \u2019 s welcome to write some new rules into the law rather than leaving these decisions to the executive branch\u2026\n\u201c Many on the left complain about the rule simply because it will reduce the number of people on food stamps \u2014 by about 700,000 , roughly 2 percent of total food-stamp enrollment , by the administration \u2019 s own estimate . But increasing benefit receipt is not an end in itself , especially when it comes at the expense of an incentive for childless , able-bodied adults to find work ; and given the massive growth the program has seen these past two decades , there is clearly room for cuts\u2026 Perhaps more to the point , whatever one \u2019 s ideal level of food-stamp enrollment , there is no good reason to gut work requirements for entire areas with low unemployment while enforcing those requirements elsewhere \u2014 or to let states play games with their maps to boost eligibility . \u201d\n\u201c The rule applies to a group called \u2018 able-bodied adults without dependents \u2019 or ABAWDs\u2026 In recognition of the difficult job market during the Great Recession , ABAWD [ work ] requirements were waived in all states as part of the federal stimulus legislation in 2009 . But after the economy recovered and unemployment fell to historic lows , some states still found ways to maintain their ABAWD waivers , using tactics such as combining distant jurisdictions while excluding low unemployment areas\u2026\n\u201c Illinois is a good example of how states have gerrymandered the waiver process to exempt ABAWDs , even during good economic times . For a previously approved waiver application , Illinois grouped all counties in the state together as an \u2018 economic area \u2019 \u2014 with the exception of low-unemployment DuPage County \u2014 in order to expand the total area that qualified for a waiver . Most Illinois counties would not qualify for a waiver on their own due to favorable economic conditions\u2026 California , with its current 3.9 percent unemployment rate , did the same , combining all but six low-unemployment counties in their waiver request . As a result , ABAWDs in 90 percent of California counties are exempt from the work requirement . \u201d\n\u201c With the U.S. unemployment rate now at 50-year lows , there are seven million job openings for only six million job seekers . Yet as of last year 2.1 million potential hires\u2014specifically , adults age 18 to 49 , able-bodied , without dependents\u2014were receiving food stamps despite not working\u2026\n\u201c The Foundation for Government Accountability calculated in August that the average jobless rate in waived areas\u2014more than 1,100 jurisdictions across 33 states\u2014was 4.5 % . \u2018 Nearly half , \u2019 the report said , \u2018 have unemployment rates at or below four percent \u2019 \u2026 There are [ always ] difficult and sympathetic cases . But if Democrats oppose even this modest step\u2014a part-time work requirement , applied to childless , able-bodied adults , in an economy with unemployment at 3.6 % \u2014then they might as well say that getting food stamps is a permanent way of life . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
