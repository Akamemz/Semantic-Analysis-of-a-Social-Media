Joni Ernst ( R ) has gone \u2018 AWOL \u2019 for missing votes in the legislature . Ernst has been accusing him of attacking her military experience with the term , and Sen.

American Heartland \u2019 s new ad attacks Jacobs , a former Texas energy company executive , as being \u2018 in the wrong state and the wrong party \u2019 because he backed a controversial environmental policy and made campaign contributions to two Democratic U.S. senators . \u2018 When nobody was looking , Texas millionaire Mark Jacobs spent his time advocating for Barack Obama \u2019 s liberal cap-and-trade scheme \u2026 , \u2019 the GOP super PAC \u2019 s ad says . \u2018 Now Mark Jacobs is running here as a Republican , spending millions to buy himself a brand new set of Iowa values . No matter how hard he tries , Mark Jacobs \u2019 millions can \u2019 t hide the fact he \u2019 s in the wrong state and the wrong party. \u2019 \u2026 Five Republicans are elbowing for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination , in hopes of replacing retiring Democrat Tom Harkin .

Al Franken hits the airwaves with the first TV ad of his re-election campaign . Franken 's 30-second spot begins running statewide Tuesday . It promotes Franken 's efforts to help train workers for skilled jobs . It features the owner of Top Tool , a small manufacturing company in Blaine , who talks about her struggle to find qualified people to fill job openings . The Democratic senator introduced a bill last year that invests in public-private partnerships between manufacturers and community and technical colleges . Federal Communications Commission filings show Franken 's campaign is spending nearly $ 146,000 on the ads , which run through Monday . \u201d\nRepublicans have their sights set on six seats to win back control of the Senate from Democrats .

But those who undergo expensive procedures such as organ transplants are a burden to the company as well . Since most big corporations are self-insured , shifting even one high-cost member out of the company plan could save the employer hundreds of thousands of dollars a year\u2014while increasing the cost of claims absorbed by the marketplace policy by a similar amount . And the health law might not prohibit it , opening a door to potential erosion of employer-based coverage\u2026.It \u2019 s unclear how many companies , if any , have moved sicker workers to exchange coverage , which became available only in January . But even a few high-risk patients could add millions of dollars in costs to those plans . The costs could be passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums and to taxpayers in the form of higher subsidy expense\u2026 . Moving high-cost workers to a marketplace plan would not trigger penalties under the health law as long as an employer offered an affordable companywide plan with minimum coverage , experts said . \u201d\n[ A new forecast from the nation \u2019 s leading small-business group , the National Federation of Independent Business , shows that ObamaCare will cost between 152,000 and 286,000 private-sector jobs over the next decade . ]\nSebelius a no-show - Although many subordinates are set to testify at a Senate appropriations hearing today , outgoing Secretary Kathleen Sebelius isn \u2019 t coming .

Bloomberg has a preview of their testimony . ]\nDaily Caller : \u201c The House rules committee convened Tuesday on Capitol Hill to prepare the contempt of Congress resolution for ex-IRS official Lois Lerner , which the full House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday . Tensions ran high as Democratic Ranking Member Rep. Louise Slaughter and other Democrats grilled Republican House oversight Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa , who represented his committee in recommending contempt . The committee considered resolutions both to hold Lerner in contempt and also to call Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor in the case . Democrats in the hearing consistently expressed certainty that the contempt citation against Lerner will pass Wednesday . \u201d\n[ New in \u2588\u2588\u2588 Opinion : American Center for Law and Justice \u2019 s Jay Sekulow asks \u201c Will Congress mark IRS targeting anniversary with contempt vote ? \u201d ]\nCalling President Obama \u2019 s meek approach \u201c painful \u201d to watch , long-time defender of administration foreign policy David Ignatius tells the president to \u201c suck it up \u201d : \u201c Everything he says is measured , and most of it is correct . But he acts as if he \u2019 s talking to a rational world , as opposed to one inhabited by leaders such as Russia \u2019 s Vladimir Putin . In the realm of power politics , U.S. presidents get points not for being right but for being ( or appearing ) strong . Presidents either say they \u2019 re going to knock the ball out of the park , or they say nothing . The intangible factors of strength and credibility ( so easy to mock ) are , in fact , the glue of a rules-based international system . Under Obama , the United States has suffered some real reputational damage . I say that as someone who sympathizes with many of Obama \u2019 s foreign policy goals . This damage , unfortunately , has largely been self-inflicted by an administration that focuses too much on short-term messaging . At key turning points \u2014 in Egypt and Libya during the Arab Spring , in Syria , in Ukraine and , yes , in Benghazi \u2014 the administration was driven by messaging priorities rather than sound , interests-based policy . That \u2019 s why the Benghazi \u2018 talking points \u2019 fiasco still has legs . \u201d\nHouse vote on Select Benghazi Committee as early as Thursday - Washington Examiner : \u201c The House will vote as early as Thursday on a resolution to create a select committee to investigate the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya . House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , citing \u2018 evasion \u2019 from the White House , introduced the resolution Tuesday night , a day after appointing Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , to head the panel , which will be made up of seven Republicans and five Democrats . Boehner said the panel will have special investigatory tools and will have the singular purpose \u2018 of getting the unvarnished truth about what took place leading up to , during , and following the terrorist attack on our consulate in Libya , \u2019 adding , \u2018 The American people will accept no less . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Another partisan review that serves only to politicize these attacks is disrespectful and unworthy of the American people. \u201d \u2013 House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi , who had sought equal representation of Democrats and Republicans on the panel , in a letter to Boehner Tuesday .\nWhite House tries to head off confirmation fight over drone policy - AP : \u201c Hoping to head off another confirmation battle , the White House said Tuesday that it will allow senators to review a secret paper justifying the drone strike on an American citizen written by one of President Barack Obama 's appellate court nominees . The White House is hoping the memo 's disclosure will lead to confirmation of David Barron for the 1st U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston . \u201d\nChild physiologist Richard A. Warshak examines the origins of the character Batman and whether the Caped Crusader \u2019 s creator developed the dark hero because of a childhood trauma of his own . Why do you care if you \u2019 re not Comic Book Guy ? Because Warshak is making a larger point about how what we endure as children makes us who we are : \u201c Early psychologists who studied trauma were concerned about its negative effects , and not surprisingly that is what they learned about . But more recent studies have searched for positive outcomes of trauma and have learned what novelists and historians have known for generations : Many people draw strength from adversity . They take inspiration from their suffering .

Clinton waded into the polarizing issue of gun politics during an appearance at the National Council for Behavioral Health conference in Oxon Hill , Maryland , pointing to recent shootings that involved teens who had been playing loud music and chewing gum and a separate incident involving the typing of text messages in a movie theater . \u201d\nBlames sexism for failure of her health initiative - CBS : \u201c Hillary Clinton spoke about her own political battles , including her struggle to lead health care reform efforts as first lady in the early 1990s .

However , she said the fight over health care reform was coarser . \u2018 Who knew Washington was so much more conservative when it came to women doing things like this ... than Arkansas , \u2019 she said . \u201d\nSought and destroyed - \u201c Sure , my boss took advantage of me , but I will always remain firm on this point : it was a consensual relationship .

It likely will be viewed as a way for Bush to make his Iowa debut for the 2016 presidential cycle - without coming to Iowa . Whether Bush will commit to running for the White House remains a question mark .

Joni Ernst (R) has gone \u2018AWOL\u2019 for missing votes in the legislature. Ernst has been accusing him of attacking her military experience with the term, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) weighed in Tuesday morning to agree. \u2018Mark respects Joni Ernst\u2019s military service and all of those who serve our country,\u2019 Jacobs spokeswoman Alissa Ohl told The Hill in an email\u2026 Jacobs, a self-funding businessman, has dominated the airwaves in the race. But Ernst has the backing of much of the GOP establishment, including former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R), as well as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and the Senate Conservatives Fund.\u201d\n\nPAC ad says Jacobs is \u2018wrong state, wrong party\u2019 - Des Moines Register: \u201cA second outside group will run negative TV ads in Iowa against Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark Jacobs. American Heartland\u2019s new ad attacks Jacobs, a former Texas energy company executive, as being \u2018in the wrong state and the wrong party\u2019 because he backed a controversial environmental policy and made campaign contributions to two Democratic U.S. senators. \u2018When nobody was looking, Texas millionaire Mark Jacobs spent his time advocating for Barack Obama\u2019s liberal cap-and-trade scheme \u2026,\u2019 the GOP super PAC\u2019s ad says. \u2018Now Mark Jacobs is running here as a Republican, spending millions to buy himself a brand new set of Iowa values. No matter how hard he tries, Mark Jacobs\u2019 millions can\u2019t hide the fact he\u2019s in the wrong state and the wrong party.\u2019\u2026 Five Republicans are elbowing for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination, in hopes of replacing retiring Democrat Tom Harkin. The presumptive Democratic nominee is Bruce Braley, whom Harkin has endorsed.\u201d\n\nFRANKEN TOUTS JOB CREATION IN FIRST AD\n\nTwin Cities Pioneer Press: \u201cU.S. Sen. Al Franken hits the airwaves with the first TV ad of his re-election campaign. Franken's 30-second spot begins running statewide Tuesday. It promotes Franken's efforts to help train workers for skilled jobs. It features the owner of Top Tool, a small manufacturing company in Blaine, who talks about her struggle to find qualified people to fill job openings. The Democratic senator introduced a bill last year that invests in public-private partnerships between manufacturers and community and technical colleges. Federal Communications Commission filings show Franken's campaign is spending nearly $146,000 on the ads, which run through Monday.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: KING OF THE SENATE\n\nRepublicans have their sights set on six seats to win back control of the Senate from Democrats. So which seats are most likely to flip from blue to red? The current consensus among Fox News First readers: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia. Fox News First reader Howard Miller says \u201cThe critical \u2018handwriting on the wall\u2019 in this election is the decision by Sen. Angus King (who has built a respected reputation among Maine Democrats to do what's best for state) that he will caucus with the Republicans if they take over the Senate.\u201d\n\nShare your top six picks.

Steve Daines, R-Mont., dedication to the working class and to ending ObamaCare in a new ad. \u201cWhen ObamaCare kicked in, our plan didn\u2019t qualify,\u201d said Wing \u201cWe lost our insurance\u2026I\u2019ve worked hard all my life and its seems like the working person isn\u2019t getting ahead again.\u201d Daines faces Montana Republican state Rep. Champ Edmunds in June 3 primary. The winner will go on to challenge incumbent Sen. John Walsh, D-Mont. in November.\n\nBIG BUSINESS READIES OBAMACARE INSURANCE DUMP\n\nDaily Beast: \u201c\u2026Patients with preexisting medical conditions like diabetes drive health spending. But those who undergo expensive procedures such as organ transplants are a burden to the company as well. Since most big corporations are self-insured, shifting even one high-cost member out of the company plan could save the employer hundreds of thousands of dollars a year\u2014while increasing the cost of claims absorbed by the marketplace policy by a similar amount. And the health law might not prohibit it, opening a door to potential erosion of employer-based coverage\u2026.It\u2019s unclear how many companies, if any, have moved sicker workers to exchange coverage, which became available only in January. But even a few high-risk patients could add millions of dollars in costs to those plans. The costs could be passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums and to taxpayers in the form of higher subsidy expense\u2026. Moving high-cost workers to a marketplace plan would not trigger penalties under the health law as long as an employer offered an affordable companywide plan with minimum coverage, experts said.\u201d\n\n[A new forecast from the nation\u2019s leading small-business group, the National Federation of Independent Business, shows that ObamaCare will cost between 152,000 and 286,000 private-sector jobs over the next decade.]\n\nSebelius a no-show - Although many subordinates are set to testify at a Senate appropriations hearing today, outgoing Secretary Kathleen Sebelius isn\u2019t coming. Previous reports suggest Sebelius is resisting Republican efforts to put her under oath again before she leaves office.\n\n[Top execs from big health insurance companies head to Capitol Hill today to testify at a House hearing on ObamaCare enrollment. Bloomberg has a preview of their testimony.]\n\nLERNER VOTES LOOM\n\nDaily Caller: \u201cThe House rules committee convened Tuesday on Capitol Hill to prepare the contempt of Congress resolution for ex-IRS official Lois Lerner, which the full House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday. Tensions ran high as Democratic Ranking Member Rep. Louise Slaughter and other Democrats grilled Republican House oversight Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, who represented his committee in recommending contempt. The committee considered resolutions both to hold Lerner in contempt and also to call Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor in the case. Democrats in the hearing consistently expressed certainty that the contempt citation against Lerner will pass Wednesday.\u201d\n\n[New in Fox News Opinion: American Center for Law and Justice\u2019s Jay Sekulow asks \u201cWill Congress mark IRS targeting anniversary with contempt vote?\u201d]\n\n\n\nOBAMA FOREIGN POLICY COALITION LOOKS THREADBARE\n\nCalling President Obama\u2019s meek approach \u201cpainful\u201d to watch, long-time defender of administration foreign policy David Ignatius tells the president to \u201csuck it up\u201d: \u201cEverything he says is measured, and most of it is correct. But he acts as if he\u2019s talking to a rational world, as opposed to one inhabited by leaders such as Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. In the realm of power politics, U.S. presidents get points not for being right but for being (or appearing) strong. Presidents either say they\u2019re going to knock the ball out of the park, or they say nothing. The intangible factors of strength and credibility (so easy to mock) are, in fact, the glue of a rules-based international system. Under Obama, the United States has suffered some real reputational damage. I say that as someone who sympathizes with many of Obama\u2019s foreign policy goals. This damage, unfortunately, has largely been self-inflicted by an administration that focuses too much on short-term messaging. At key turning points \u2014 in Egypt and Libya during the Arab Spring, in Syria, in Ukraine and, yes, in Benghazi \u2014 the administration was driven by messaging priorities rather than sound, interests-based policy. That\u2019s why the Benghazi \u2018talking points\u2019 fiasco still has legs.\u201d\n\nHouse vote on Select Benghazi Committee as early as Thursday - Washington Examiner: \u201cThe House will vote as early as Thursday on a resolution to create a select committee to investigate the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, citing \u2018evasion\u2019 from the White House, introduced the resolution Tuesday night, a day after appointing Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., to head the panel, which will be made up of seven Republicans and five Democrats. Boehner said the panel will have special investigatory tools and will have the singular purpose \u2018of getting the unvarnished truth about what took place leading up to, during, and following the terrorist attack on our consulate in Libya,\u2019 adding, \u2018The American people will accept no less.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother partisan review that serves only to politicize these attacks is disrespectful and unworthy of the American people.\u201d \u2013 House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who had sought equal representation of Democrats and Republicans on the panel, in a letter to Boehner Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWhite House tries to head off confirmation fight over drone policy - AP: \u201cHoping to head off another confirmation battle, the White House said Tuesday that it will allow senators to review a secret paper justifying the drone strike on an American citizen written by one of President Barack Obama's appellate court nominees. The White House is hoping the memo's disclosure will lead to confirmation of David Barron for the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nChild physiologist Richard A. Warshak examines the origins of the character Batman and whether the Caped Crusader\u2019s creator developed the dark hero because of a childhood trauma of his own. Why do you care if you\u2019re not Comic Book Guy? Because Warshak is making a larger point about how what we endure as children makes us who we are: \u201cEarly psychologists who studied trauma were concerned about its negative effects, and not surprisingly that is what they learned about. But more recent studies have searched for positive outcomes of trauma and have learned what novelists and historians have known for generations: Many people draw strength from adversity. They take inspiration from their suffering. They transcend their traumas and become better people.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Clinton waded into the polarizing issue of gun politics during an appearance at the National Council for Behavioral Health conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland, pointing to recent shootings that involved teens who had been playing loud music and chewing gum and a separate incident involving the typing of text messages in a movie theater.\u201d\n\nBlames sexism for failure of her health initiative - CBS: \u201cHillary Clinton spoke about her own political battles, including her struggle to lead health care reform efforts as first lady in the early 1990s. She noted that before she took on health care at the White House, she had led education reform efforts as first lady of Arkansas. However, she said the fight over health care reform was coarser. \u2018Who knew Washington was so much more conservative when it came to women doing things like this... than Arkansas,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nSought and destroyed - \u201cSure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any \u2018abuse\u2019 came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position. . . . The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor\u2019s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me.

The former Florida governor will host a fundraiser in Coral Gables [Fla.] for Gov. Terry Branstad on May 22, the Iowan\u2019s campaign aides confirmed to The Des Moines Register. It likely will be viewed as a way for Bush to make his Iowa debut for the 2016 presidential cycle - without coming to Iowa. Whether Bush will commit to running for the White House remains a question mark. But any brushes with the influential residents of Iowa, the state that has the front row seat in the presidential nominating process, tends to whip speculation into a frenzy.\u201d\n\n[A new CNN poll shows former Florida Gov.

Charlie Crist (D) said Tuesday that a \u2018big reason\u2019 why he left the Republican Party was because many in the GOP were hostile to President Obama due to his race. Crist, who is running for his old office against Gov. Rick Scott (R), said in an interview with Fusion\u2019s Jorge Ramos that he felt uncomfortable with his previous party affiliation. Republicans are perceived as \u2018anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-minority, [and] anti-gay,\u2019 he said, and they refuse to compromise with Obama. The ex-governor said he feels, \u2018liberated as a Democrat.\u2019\u2026 He holds a double-digit lead in at least one poll over Scott, who suffers from poor approval ratings.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen.

At least for now. \u201cIn a monumental victory for targeted conservatives in the secret investigation, Judge Rudolph Randa on Tuesday granted a preliminary injunction to stop the politically charged probe, ruling in favor of conservative activist Eric O\u2019Keefe, his Wisconsin Club for growth and \u2018others.\u2019 The probe had been looking into possible illegal coordination between conservative groups and Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s, [R-Wis.,] recall election campaign, but came under fire for the opaque way it was conducted.\u201d Watchdog.org has the details.\n\n\n\nSURVEY SAYS: D\u2019OH!\n\nTo win big on \u201cFamily Feud\u201d two members of a family have to combine to get 200 points, so when Tim Sass scored an epic 182 points in the final round of his family\u2019s appearance on the long-running game show, he must have felt pretty confident that his team would walk away with $20,000. But he didn\u2019t remember the political adage, \u201cYou are never as far up as you think you are.\u201d When his relative Anna stepped up to the plate, she got exactly zero points. (For example: No one in the survey though that \u201cthrow up\u201d was a good answer for \u201csomething a stomach did.\u201d) The Sass family did walk away with $5 per point and $910 ain\u2019t too shabby.\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the oldest superstition around.
