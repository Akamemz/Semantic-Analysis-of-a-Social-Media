    "content": "The generation gap in American politics is dividing two younger age groups , Millennials and Generation X , from the two older groups , Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation .\nIn 2016 , as in recent years , Millennials and Gen Xers were the most Democratic generations . And both groups had relatively large \u2013 and growing \u2013 shares of liberal Democrats : 27 % of Millennials and 21 % of Gen Xers identified as liberal Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents .\nBy contrast , Boomers and Silents were the most Republican groups \u2013 largely because of the higher shares of conservative Republicans in these generations . Nearly a third of Boomers ( 31 % ) and 36 % of Silents described themselves as conservative Republicans or Republican leaners , which also is higher than in the past .\nThe differences in partisan identification across generations are most apparent in the shares of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in each . All four groups have comparable numbers when it comes to groups in the middle : conservative and moderate Democrats and moderate and liberal Republicans .\nThe public \u2019 s overall partisan and ideological balance changes little from year to year . But there have been some long-term shifts among the public and within generational groups , according to a new analysis based on more than 15,000 interviews conducted in 2016 as well as earlier survey data . ( For a look at trends among registered voters , see \u201c The Parties on the Eve of the 2016 Election : Two Coalitions , Moving Further Apart . \u201d )\nThe share of liberal Democrats in the public has grown . In 2016 , 21 % of Americans identified as Democrats or Democratic leaners and also as liberal . While that is only somewhat higher than a year earlier ( 19 % ) , it is the highest share dating back to 2000 . At that time , just 12 % of the public described themselves as both liberal and as Democrats or Democratic leaners .\nThere has been little change since 2000 in other partisan and ideological categories , although the share saying they do not lean to either party is smaller today ( 11 % ) than in the early 2000s ( 17 % in 2000 ) .\nMillennials were most likely to identify as liberal Democrats . In 2016 , a majority of Millennials ( 55 % ) identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic ; 27 % described themselves as liberal Democrats \u2013 the highest share of any generation . For much of the past decade , conservative and moderate Democrats outnumbered liberal Democrats among Millennials . But in the past few years , there were about as many liberal Democrats as conservative and moderate Democrats among this youngest adult age group ( those who were 18 to 35 in 2016 ) .\nThe share of liberal Democrats in Gen X ticked up . As in recent years , conservative and moderate Democrats made up the largest partisan and ideological group among Gen Xers ( 27 % ) , who were ages 36 to 51 last year . However , the share of Gen Xers who identified as liberal Democrats ( 21 % ) stood at its highest point since 2000 . About as many Gen Xers ( 23 % ) described themselves as conservative Republicans , a figure that has not changed much in recent years .\nBoomers have turned more conservative . In both 2015 and 2016 , about three-in-ten Boomers ( 30 % in 2015 , 31 % in 2016 ) identified as conservative Republicans \u2013 the highest percentages dating back to 2000 . In both years , conservative Republicans made up the largest single partisan and ideological group among Boomers .\nMembers of the Silent Generation continued to be most likely to identify as conservative Republicans . The GOP has made large gains among Silents in recent years . Eight years ago , Democrats and Democratic leaners outnumbered Republicans and GOP leaners among Silents by 48 % to 40 % ; in 2016 , 49 % of Silents identified as Republicans or leaned Republican , while 43 % leaned Democratic . The share of Silents who describe themselves as conservative Republicans increased by 9 percentage points over this period , from 27 % to 36 % .",
