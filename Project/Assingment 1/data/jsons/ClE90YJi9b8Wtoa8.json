    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The House adopted a budget Thursday that sets the stage for a rewrite of the tax system , as Republicans overcame internal divisions and began a six-day countdown for releasing closely guarded details of their tax plan .\nThe vote on the budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 was 216-212 , a slim margin that is an early indication of the difficulty Republican leaders will face in cobbling together the votes for a tax bill packed with trade-offs .\nEleven of the 20 Republican no votes came from representatives of the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey , who opposed the budget because of the party \u2019 s plan to limit or repeal the federal deduction for state and local taxes .\nSatisfying their demands presents a hurdle . A compromise could force GOP leaders to kill other tax breaks to make up for the hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue a deal could add to the bill . But failing to gain an agreement with some or all of the 11 representatives would send Republicans into a floor vote in November with very little room to maneuver .\nHouse Republicans now turn to the even tougher work of writing , amending and passing a tax bill on an incredibly ambitious schedule . House and Senate leaders each want to pass tax legislation before Thanksgiving , which means going from having no publicly available bill to consequential votes in 22 days .\nThe goal is to lower tax rates sharply for individuals , corporations and other businesses , while at the same time repealing or limiting enough tax breaks so that the measure doesn \u2019 t raise the projected federal deficit by more than $ 1.5 trillion over the next decade .\n\u201c This budget that we just passed in the House today brings us one step closer to historic tax reform , \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) said . \u201c That means more jobs , fairer taxes , bigger paychecks for Americans . \u201d\nThe sacred cows of the tax code\u2014including breaks for home mortgage interest and state and local taxes\u2014are being challenged .

The Senate will be about a week behind that pace , said Sen. John Cornyn ( R. , Texas ) .\nThe outlines of the plan have been clear for months . Republicans want to drop the corporate tax rate to 20 % from 35 % , set a 25 % rate on businesses that pay through their owners \u2019 individual tax returns , repeal the estate tax and make tax filing simpler .\nRepublicans are willing to accept higher short-run budget deficits driven by tax cuts to spur what they promise will be much faster economic growth , though many economists dispute that link .\nWhat Republicans haven \u2019 t done isshow how it all adds up , give details on which tax breaks would vanish or offer enough information for families to calculate their future tax bills .\nWhat is left to decide , said Mr. Cornyn , is \u201c the spinach , as they call it . Not the dessert , but the spinach . That \u2019 s the [ tax-cut ] offsets . \u201d\nObstacles loom in every direction . In the House , where Republicans have a 239-194 edge , opposition by members from high-local-tax states narrows the party \u2019 s margins significantly , though that won \u2019 t be the only issue .\nSo far , party leaders haven \u2019 t been able to reach a compromise that would continue some federal tax break for local property taxes .
