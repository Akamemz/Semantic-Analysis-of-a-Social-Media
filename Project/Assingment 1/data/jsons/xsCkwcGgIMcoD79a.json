Roberts , Comcast \u2019 s chief executive , has said .\nStill , the combination of the two companies , creating a cable and broadband behemoth serving 30 million customers across 42 states , is expected to come under intense scrutiny from the Obama administration , which has toughened its enforcement of federal antitrust laws .\nBut much of the focus on Thursday over how the proposed deal would affect competition in cable TV overshadowed what could be a more important consideration for regulators : the merger \u2019 s effect on broadband Internet service , which is rapidly becoming the most important pipe running into the homes of most American consumers .\nA merged Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have nearly twice as many high-speed Internet subscribers as the next largest company and would control roughly 38 percent of the high-speed Internet market , according to figures compiled by the Leichtman Research Group , an independent firm in Durham , N.H . The combined companies would account for nearly 32 million broadband customers , compared with 16 million for AT & T and nine million for Verizon .\nThe effect on cable TV and Internet service prompted many consumer advocacy organizations to immediately express hostility toward the deal .\n\u201c This industry is notoriously unpopular with consumers due to poor customer service , not to mention ever-increasing bills , and a deal this size doesn \u2019 t exactly convince us that things will get better , \u201d said Delara Derakhshani , policy counsel for Consumers Union .\nWashington lawmakers also said they would give it close scrutiny . Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , chairwoman of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee , said that because the proposed merger \u201c could have a significant impact on the cable industry and affect consumers across the country , \u201d she planned to convene a hearing to examine the deal .\nThe transaction also has raised concerns among some of the cable networks , whose channels reach consumers through providers like Comcast . Randel Falco , chief executive of Univision Communications , said the company would monitor the government review .\n\u201c When the No . 1 and the No . 2 cable operators merge it is a cause of concern that requires significant scrutiny , \u201d Mr. Falco said .\nBut Comcast officials dismissed much of the criticism of the deal as \u201c hysteria \u201d and noted that the new company \u2019 s market share of cable subscribers would be no higher than it was after completing a similar transaction with Adelphia in 2006 .\nIn addition , Comcast said that it and Time Warner Cable did not compete in a single ZIP code anywhere in the United States . Nor is the deal likely to have an effect on other providers of television programming \u2014 including Verizon , AT & T , DirecTV and Dish \u2014 which in recent years have performed better than the cable companies . Since 2005 , Comcast said , telecommunications companies and satellite providers gained 18 million customers while traditional cable companies lost 10 million subscribers .\n\u201c Previous antitrust concerns are truly antiquated in light of today \u2019 s marketplace realities , \u201d David L. Cohen , a Comcast executive and its chief lobbyist , said on Thursday .\nThere are also \u201c cord cutters \u201d who have jettisoned their cable providers and watch television on the Internet via fast-growing services like Netflix and YouTube .\nComcast already has plenty of experience dealing with antitrust and other regulatory officials in Washington . In 2011 , the company spent a year persuading officials at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to approve its takeover of the entertainment giant NBCUniversal . It gained the approval in part by agreeing to certain conditions , among them a promise not to use NBC \u2019 s clout as a provider of programming to deny access to its customers by competing producers of television and films .\nBut many in Washington say that Mr. Cohen , a veteran of Philadelphia politics , is Comcast \u2019 s secret weapon in trying to persuade government regulators to sign off on the deal .\nMr. Cohen has close ties to President Obama , perhaps even closer than Comcast \u2019 s chief executive , Mr. Roberts , who has golfed with the president on Martha \u2019 s Vineyard .\nA major Democratic fund-raiser , Mr. Cohen and his wife hosted Mr. Obama at their Philadelphia home in 2011 , raising $ 1.2 million at an event where the president called the couple \u201c great friends . \u201d\nMr. Cohen also was a guest at the White House on Tuesday for the state dinner in honor of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France .\nOther Comcast officials have the ability to reach deep into the regulatory agencies that will review the merger , while officials at those agencies also are very familiar with Comcast and the cable business .
