He reportedly met with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- who was foreign minister of Germany when the deal was negotiated . He has also met with French President Emmanuel Macron twice and spoken by phone with European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini .\nThe Globe reported that Kerry was quiet in his campaign as he believes that a high-profile defense of the deal by prominent Democrats would only make Trump more likely to pull the U.S. out of the deal .\nKerry \u2019 s reported actions immediately sparked criticism and raised claims that such dealings with Iranian and European officials could violate the Logan Act -- which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorization\nWhile no one has ever been successfully prosecuted under the law , the Logan Act was raised last year over former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2019 s negotiations at the United Nations over a resolution with Israel during the Trump transition .\n\u201c John Kerry helped craft a flaccid deal that granted the terror regime in Tehran vast monetary and geopolitical concessions , even as it put them on the glide path to nuclear weapons by its own terms , \u201d Sohrab Ahmari , senior writer at Commentary magazine , told Fox News . \u201c The biggest public service he can render now is to go away . \u201d\nFlorida Sen.
