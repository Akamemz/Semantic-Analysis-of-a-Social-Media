    "content": "Right around the time Donald Trump was boarding Air Force One en route to Saudi Arabia , soon to escape a capital city obsessed with investigations into his campaign \u2019 s ties with Russia and the firing of FBI Director James Comey , his vice president was receiving a booming ovation inside a fifth-floor Ritz-Carlton ballroom in the nearby Virginia suburbs . It was the afternoon of May 19 , and Mike Pence stood before several hundred members of the Council for National Policy\u2014a secretive group of conservative movement activists , donors and intellectuals that meets under off-the-record rules\u2014and downplayed the perception of a presidency in crisis . \u201c The truth is , you elected a man who never quits . He never backs down . He \u2019 s a fighter . He \u2019 s a winner , \u201d Pence said , according to an audio recording obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine . \u201c And I \u2019 ll make you a promise : No matter what Washington , D.C. , might be focused on at any given moment , President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the American people and for advancing an agenda that will make America great again ! \u201d\nHis audience roared . For those who feared the GOP \u2019 s once-in-a-generation opportunity for a policy renaissance was being squandered by infighting and incompetence and the creeping scent of scandal , the vice president \u2019 s words , as they so often have during the early days of the Trump administration , provided temporary relief . The performance was vintage Pence . He was grandiose but grounded , hailing a host of early victories but cautioning that the biggest were yet to come ; he was authoritative but deferential , speaking for the party and the government while carrying greetings from his boss . Above all , Pence was upbeat , befitting the \u201c happy warrior \u201d persona he has long labored to promote . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to get through all these accomplishments\u2014unless you \u2019 re watching cable news , \u201d he said , chuckling . \u201c They never come up , except on one network ! \u201d Had Pence not nodded twice to the Beltway media \u2019 s preoccupations , one would have had no inkling that Trump was enduring the most perilous stretch of his young presidency\u2014or that Pence appeared at risk of becoming collateral damage .\nThe night before , on the eve of Trump \u2019 s first foreign trip\u2014and Pence \u2019 s private speech\u2014two news outlets published a pair of eyebrow-raising stories that reflected mounting anxiety within the vice president \u2019 s inner circle . The sourcing and strategy seemed clearly choreographed . First , both articles aimed to distance Pence from the chaos engulfing Trump \u2019 s White House ; CNN quoted \u201c a senior administration adviser \u201d who said Pence \u201c looks tired \u201d and never expected such mayhem on the job , while NBC cited \u201c a source close to the administration \u201d who complained of a \u201c pattern \u201d of Pence being kept in the dark on matters relating to the scandal-plagued former national security adviser , Mike Flynn . Second , both stories were authored by former Pence \u201c embeds , \u201d reporters who had spent months traveling with him and are expertly sourced among the vice president \u2019 s tight-knit team . And third , the news accounts cast Pence in a sympathetic light at the very moment when the D.C. media was , for the first time , beginning to hammer him . The New York Times had reported the day earlier that Flynn informed the Pence-run transition team before Inauguration Day that he was under federal investigation ; the implications for Pence were staggering , and the White House categorically denied the story . But Pence had also courted trouble the week earlier by insisting that Trump \u2019 s decision to fire Comey was based on the deputy attorney general \u2019 s recommendation\u2014a claim Trump promptly contradicted in an interview with NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt , embarrassing the vice president and sending an awkward question echoing around Washington : Is Pence being kept out of the loop , or is he being deceitful ?\nThe answer , in conversations with more than a dozen people familiar with the vice president \u2019 s role in the administration and his relationship with Trump , is actually neither . They concede he has on several occasions been the victim of an uncommunicative White House\u2014and an unpredictable president\u2014that regularly leaves top officials hanging out to dry . They also reject the suggestion that he looks \u201c tired , \u201d though several friends acknowledge that his patience with the West Wing \u2019 s dysfunction has worn thin . But whether that pro-Pence leaker told CNN and NBC News the truth is less relevant than the fact there was a pro-Pence leaker at all .\nFrom the moment last July when Trump picked Pence as his running mate , through the first five months of this administration , the vice president has been all but invisible in the parade of palace intrigue stories detailing the rivalries , alliances , backstabbing , self-promoting and stock-watching inside Trump \u2019 s reality-TV style presidency . That is no accident : Pence made clear to everyone around him when he was picked , and again at the outset of the administration , that the spotlight belongs to Trump . Leaking , speaking out of turn or doing anything that could be perceived as upstaging the president would not be tolerated . \u201c He laid down the law , \u201d one Pence associate recalls . \u201c This was going to be about Trump , not him. \u201d Unsurprisingly , the vice president declined to comment for this story .\nHis inconspicuousness is engineered to keep all eyes on the president . But it \u2019 s also necessary to guard against whispers that he , not Trump , is running the show\u2014a narrative fueled both by Pence \u2019 s standing in the party and by the fact that he has been empowered like no vice president before him to establish , sell and execute the administration \u2019 s agenda . Five months into the Trump era\u2014and less than a year since he was plucked from a thorny situation in Indiana\u2014Pence , once an endangered small-state governor , has become the most popular Republican in the country and accumulated an astonishing amount of power . He is deeply involved with nearly every major decision coming from the White House , whether it be the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord or the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . He is the administration \u2019 s most effective and reassuring messenger , often because of his license to clarify or even correct things said by his boss . And he is widely viewed by Republicans on Capitol Hill as the de facto leader of the GOP\u2014not just the safety parachute for a free-falling presidency , but a polished , respected statesman from whom members can take their cues .\nMike Pence has a very full and complex portfolio in his briefcase . And he has to carry it like there \u2019 s a bottle of nitroglycerin inside. \u201d Ken Blackwell\nThis outsized stature , however , also threatens the harmony between Pence and his famously fickle superior . Trump has come to trust his second in command above everyone else in the White House , people close to both men say , prizing Pence \u2019 s unwavering loyalty and discretion . And yet the vice president \u2019 s camp operates in a continual state of apprehension , having been handed massive responsibilities by a president known for his insecurities and acute sensitivity to being overshadowed . Ken Blackwell , the former Ohio secretary of state and longtime conservative activist who ran the domestic policy wing of Pence \u2019 s transition team , put it this way : \u201c Mike Pence has a very full and complex portfolio in his briefcase . And he has to carry it like there \u2019 s a bottle of nitroglycerin inside . \u201d\nRiding on his campaign plane last October , shortly before a botched landing at La Guardia sent us skidding off the rain-slicked runway , Pence described his first conversation with Trump about joining the ticket . The Indiana governor said he \u201c wanted to know what the job description was , because there \u2019 s only one person who writes it , and that \u2019 s the president. \u201d Pence declined to share Trump \u2019 s answer\u2014I would find out after Election Day\u2014but he did tell me the Republican nominee liked the fact that he had been a governor . \u201c I also think he was impressed with my 12 years in Congress , and [ by ] the relationships that I enjoy not only with members of the House , \u201d Pence said , \u201c but also with former members of the House who are now in the Senate . \u201d\nThere is no trace of buyer \u2019 s remorse . Trump boasts often about his selection of Pence , administration officials say , and feels validated by his performance and the praise it has elicited . Trump has gotten more than just a veteran lawmaker with D.C. connections . In a White House governed by amateurism , if not anarchy , Pence has come to be seen as an island of efficacy and discipline . He has soothed nerves at home and abroad with private chats and public speeches ; he has made an art form of normalizing Trump . But nothing has come easily\u2014not for someone riding shotgun during the wildest presidency in modern American history . It \u2019 s unclear for now whether those CNN and NBC stories resulted from one overzealous ally freelancing on Pence \u2019 s behalf , or from a dam of pent-up frustration among many others beginning to burst . Whatever the case , one thing is obvious to the vice president \u2019 s friends : He is getting more than he bargained for . \u201c The job has been even more challenging than I had thought it might be , \u201d says Jeb Hensarling , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and one of Pence \u2019 s closest confidants . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure I \u2019 ve seen a political figure in my lifetime take as many body blows as President Trump has . And admittedly , his tweets have probably brought a few upon himself. \u201d ( Pence often sees Trump \u2019 s tweets for the first time when reading them in the daily news summary put together by his staff . )\nGROWING UP PENCE | 1 : As a schoolboy , he participated in speech competitions ; he is pictured here with a trophy from one . 2 : After attending Hanover College in Indiana , Pence , pictured with his father , Ed , earned a law degree from Indiana University in 1986 . 3 : Mike and Karen Pence were married on June 8 , 1985 . 4 : The Pences would have three children , Michael , Charlotte and Audrey . 5 : The Pences , pictured here before they were married , met while Mike was attending law school . 6 : The couple at the Indianapolis 500 . 7 : The Pences \u2019 son , Michael , is a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps . | Chris Dickson\nThese are challenges for which Pence \u2019 s disposition , personal worldview and political experience make him uniquely well suited . He is a steady , unemotional influence on the president , friends say , having lost his cool only once\u2014when Flynn lied to him about his contacts with the Russians\u2014and taking care otherwise to always keep a poker face . He preaches and prides himself on loyalty , be it in politics , business or anything else . ( Pence \u2019 s marriage has made an impression on his boss ; people who have spent time with them say Trump has commented approvingly , if quizzically , on how the vice president and second lady are always holding hands . ) And Pence has been unfaltering in his belief that Trump is meant to be a transformative character in American political history ; even when things looked grim early on election night , Pence texted a \u201c Dewey Defeats Truman \u201d cover to some of his pessimistic allies .\nPerhaps most important , Pence feels a sincere affection for Trump . He told me last fall that a turning point in their relationship was when the Republican nominee began asking him for periodic prayer sessions , and said he was especially moved when Trump called him the night of the vice presidential debate and left a voicemail saying he had just said a prayer for Pence . Today , White House aides say Trump \u2019 s increasingly frequent references to God are unquestionably the product of his spending so much time with his vice president . Their kinship might seem forced , or even phony , but the two men have become closer personally and professionally than anyone in either camp could have imagined a year ago . They speak multiple times a day by phone when physically apart and are often inseparable around the White House ; some joke that Pence will become jealous now that Melania Trump has moved in . The bond between them , however unlikely it once seemed , keeps Pence content to forgo accolades even though he \u2019 s the one person in Trump \u2019 s close orbit whose performance merits them .\nUnlike other West Wingers who nurture narratives of their own indispensability\u2014Steve Bannon , Jared Kushner , Kellyanne Conway , among others\u2014it is Pence , to many Republicans in town , who has unassumingly emerged as the most valuable player in Trump \u2019 s White House . If it \u2019 s easy to miss , that \u2019 s the point . The vice president \u2019 s persona\u2014the wholesome , aw-shucks , milk-drinking Midwesterner\u2014masks the skill set of a savvy political operator who grasps the nuances of government in a way that Trump \u2019 s team of outsiders can not hope to , and who understands better than anyone how to survive and thrive in this White House : Get the job done , and avoid all acclaim in the process . In April , for example , when Pence brokered the compromise between conservatives and moderates that allowed the House to improbably pass the American Health Care Act , his office pleaded with lawmakers and outside groups to stop crediting the \u201c Pence amendment , \u201d preferring that Trump and Representatives Mark Meadows and Tom MacArthur get the accolades . ( The idea for state-based waivers became known as the \u201c MacArthur amendment. \u201d ) Pence worked to ensure that evangelical leaders were brought into the fold in the first days of the administration and then nudged Trump to deliver on their pet issues of abortion and religious liberty , all while privately touting the president to those audiences as an unrelenting champion for traditional values . And given tremendous latitude as head of the transition , Pence helped stock the administration with like-minded allies , including many of his own loyalists\u2014giving the vice president eyes and ears and influence across the federal government\u2014only to lavish praise on Trump as the visionary who assembled the most conservative Cabinet ever .\nThe president likes people who don \u2019 t showboat ... And the president loves killers\u2014he loves people who get things done. \u201d Senior Trump administration aide\nIt is Pence whom Trump calls on first during almost every meeting . It is Pence whose opinion Trump solicits before every big decision . It is Pence who has emerged as the essential supporting actor in Trump \u2019 s presidency . And it is Pence who says the very least about it .\n\u201c Think about this , \u201d a senior administration aide tells me . \u201c The president likes people who don \u2019 t showboat , who don \u2019 t call attention to themselves . And the president loves killers\u2014he loves people who get things done. \u201d A long pause . \u201c Mike Pence is the quiet killer in this White House . And Trump loves him for it . \u201d\nIf doing that job for a boss like Trump is the equivalent of walking a tightrope , it could get narrower in a hurry . Nobody expects Pence , who just turned 58 , to suddenly usurp the president in any way ; that \u2019 s just not who he is . But people close to him understand that with each new layer of legal jeopardy Trump encounters , be it in relation to Russia , Comey , Flynn , any combination of the three or something else entirely , the murmurs of \u201c President Pence \u201d will only grow louder . ( After weeks of deliberation , Pence in mid-June followed Trump \u2019 s lead in hiring an outside counsel to deal with the expanding Russia-related inquiries . ) The president \u2019 s precarious situation , coupled with Pence \u2019 s recent burst of political activity\u2014in May he formed a new PAC , the Great America Committee ; his summer calendar is littered with campaign swings on behalf of prominent lawmakers ; he has been hosting intimate dinners with key activists and donors ; and there are discussions underway about reengaging with his old friends Charles and David Koch\u2014might produce a perception that becomes unmanageable for the vice president \u2019 s team . Republicans on Capitol Hill already operate as though Pence sits atop the party , and some have recently begun gossiping with a surprising lack of discretion about their expectation that the 71-year-old Trump will decline to seek reelection in 2020 . What little buzz about President Pence exists in the GOP has less to do with impeachment than it does with speculation that Trump might simply tire of the White House and hand the reins to his deputy .\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine \u2019 s email of the week \u2019 s best , delivered to your inbox every Friday morning .

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply .\nThe vice president , in a previous political life , made little secret of his aspirations for the top job . His aides now insist it \u2019 s the furthest thing from his mind , that his sole focus is promoting the president \u2019 s agenda . That is probably true . But with every new investigative drip that damages Trump , with every utterance of the I-word , with every self-immolating tweet and , at the very least , with every passing day of this presidency , the GOP will more and more look to Pence as next in line\u2014a reality that his friends privately acknowledge they have begun to reckon with , and one that the vice president can \u2019 t afford to ignore .\n\u201c He doesn \u2019 t know when his time will be\u2014it could be seven-and-a-half years , it could be seven-and-a-half months , \u201d another West Wing official says of Pence . \u201c But he had better be ready . \u201d\nNobody seems to know how Pence discovered where the House Freedom Caucus was meeting . It was March 24 , the day of the House GOP \u2019 s failed first attempt at repealing Obamacare , and as Speaker Paul Ryan met with Trump at the White House to explain that their bill didn \u2019 t have enough votes to pass , the Freedom Caucus \u2019 roughly three dozen members filed into a private room at the Capitol Hill Club . They wanted to plot their next move in secret ; to avoid leaks , no aides , other lawmakers or White House officials were told of their location . Not long after they had gathered , however , the door was flung open and in marched Pence . He was accompanied by Trump \u2019 s chief of staff , Reince Priebus , and neither man was smiling .\nWith the American Health Care Act breathing its last\u2014that is , until Pence resuscitated it over the ensuing weeks\u2014the vice president pleaded with his fellow tea partiers to reconsider their opposition . When they held their ground , the vice president let loose an uncharacteristic flash of anger . \u201c I was the Freedom Caucus before the Freedom Caucus existed , \u201d Pence told them , his voice rising , according to multiple people who were in the room . \u201c Don \u2019 t try to tell me this bill isn \u2019 t conservative enough . \u201d\nIt was the most animated they had ever seen him . And it worked : After Pence abruptly exited the meeting , and several grown men had broken into tears because of the tension present in the room , a chorus of Freedom Caucus members informed Chairman Meadows that they would now support the legislation if a vote were held . It turned out to be too late\u2014Ryan \u2019 s team had already hemorrhaged a huge number of moderates , and the AHCA never saw the floor that day\u2014but Pence \u2019 s power play was not lost on a group of lawmakers who pride themselves on defying their party \u2019 s leadership . \u201c There were a number of our people who would have voted with the vice president based on that meeting , \u201d Meadows tells me . \u201c There were House Freedom Caucus members willing to support the bill , despite great reservations , because of Vice President Pence . \u201d\n\u201c Even when you disagree with him , you want to agree with him , because it \u2019 s Mike Pence , \u201d says Jim Jordan , the founding chairman of the Freedom Caucus . He was a Pence pupil upon coming to Congress in 2007 and eventually joined him in the fraternity of lawmakers who chaired the Republican Study Committee , a group that housed the conservative rebellion before the Freedom Caucus spun off as a smaller coterie of hard-liners . Jordan wasn \u2019 t moved by Pence \u2019 s final plea , but he could tell other members were . \u201c The fact that the vice president was encouraging us to support it made it that much harder to be against it , \u201d he says . \u201c And it made us want to work that much harder to get it done . That \u2019 s what happened : The waiver idea started with Mike . \u201d\nIndeed , the proposal to allow states to opt out of certain Obamacare requirements\u2014a key modification after the first Republican bill flopped\u2014originated not with MacArthur , who then chaired the moderate Tuesday Group caucus , but with Pence . The vice president had begun lobbying Trump immediately after the March 24 debacle to let him keep pursuing a health care deal . With the president \u2019 s blessing , Pence \u2019 s office drafted the language , and he shared it separately with the conservatives and centrists before calling a joint meeting to iron out details that were lost in translation ( or , as some suspected , that were presented somewhat differently just to get the two factions talking ) .\nYou could see the discomfort on his face when he was playing the mediator when in his heart he wanted to side with the conservatives. \u201d A longtime Pence friend on Capitol Hill\nThis , to many Pence allies , has been the trickiest part of his new job : shedding his ideological bias as a deeply rooted movement conservative so that he can carry Trump \u2019 s message to , and build trust with , other elements of the GOP . \u201c There was a lot of conservative angst with Pence during the first AHCA fight\u2014we knew he wouldn \u2019 t have voted for it if he were still in Congress , \u201d says one longtime friend on Capitol Hill . \u201c And you could see the discomfort on his face when he was playing the mediator when in his heart he wanted to side with the conservatives. \u201d At the same time , though , moderates appreciated how Pence gave them space , knowing their districts were different from the sort he used to represent . \u201c He \u2019 s tried to help without going too far , \u201d MacArthur told the Indianapolis Star shortly before the revised bill passed .\nOf course , abject neutrality from the vice president would be of little use to this White House . With little margin for error in a polarized Congress , Pence enjoys singular leverage as a liaison between Trump World\u2014which is heavily populated by social liberals and establishment Republicans\u2014and the conservatives who can vote as a bloc to derail the president 's agenda . \u201c Bannon tried to bark orders at us . Priebus is a nervous nelly who doesn \u2019 t want to lose proximity to the president because he thinks he \u2019 s going to lose his job . His family members have no street cred with conservatives . And none of us trusts Gary Cohn , \u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me . \u201c So we look around for someone we can trust , and Mike is the go-to guy . \u201d\nAlthough he would not enter Congress until 2001 , Pence first ran for a House seat in 1988 , and met with President Ronald Reagan during the campaign . \u201c I felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore ! \u201d Pence later said . | Newscom\nThis dynamic has occasionally made things uncomfortable for Pence , such as when conservative outside groups bludgeoned the first health care bill , prompting him to vent to allies about their motivations . Or when Trump , on the heels of that health care defeat , sent several tweets targeting individual Freedom Caucus members and calling for their defeat in 2018 . Pence met with the group several days later , and lawmakers voiced their displeasure with the White House . They hoped the vice president would sympathize\u2014having once been in their shoes , a conservative congressman voting against his party \u2019 s president\u2014but were surprised when , after Meadows pressed him for an informal agreement to end the administration \u2019 s broadsides against the Freedom Caucus , a stone-faced Pence answered simply , \u201c I \u2019 ll pass that along to the president . \u201d\nIt was a no-win situation for Pence : Fox Business published an account of the meeting saying he had apologized to the Freedom Caucus for the president \u2019 s tweets , which he had not , and the vice president \u2019 s office sprang into damage-control mode to refute the suggestion\u2014internally dangerous for Pence\u2014that the vice president had undermined Trump by apologizing for his actions . At the same time , an apology was precisely what some members wanted , and they left upset that Pence hadn \u2019 t offered one .\nNot coincidentally , Trump \u2019 s menacing tweets aimed at Capitol Hill ceased thereafter . Pence \u2019 s role in squashing the president \u2019 s feud with Freedom Caucus members\u2014and then helping to pass the bill whose initial failure had sparked it\u2014validates Trump \u2019 s choice of running mate . But in puzzling out their relationship , that was only one part of the equation : It explained why Pence was attractive to Trump , but not why Trump \u2019 s vice presidency was appealing to Pence . It wasn \u2019 t until months after our brush with disaster at LaGuardia that a senior campaign official told me what Trump \u2019 s job description of the vice presidency had been . \u201c He told Pence he wanted \u2018 the most consequential vice president ever , \u2019 \u201d the source recalled of their meeting . \u201c Those were his words . \u201d\nPence , of course , had other reasons to join the ticket : His governorship in Indiana was derailed by the mishandling of religious freedom legislation , and although he was more likely than not to win reelection in 2016 , his approval rating was underwater statewide . His deputies were preparing for a nasty , negative slog of a campaign . The chance for a fresh start , on the national stage no less , would seem more than enough for someone in Pence \u2019 s position\u2014even without Trump promising to make him chief operating officer and arguably the shadow president of his administration .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s highly unusual , \u201d David McIntosh , president of the Club for Growth and a former Indiana congressman who has known Pence for decades , says of his working relationship with the president . \u201c During the campaign , Trump put Pence in a unique position for any vice presidential candidate I \u2019 ve seen in my lifetime \u2026 and that continued when they were sworn in to office : Trump trusted Pence to be loyal [ because ] he was willing to give him a lot of authority . \u201d\nThis is essential to understanding their relationship : Trump has given his vice president an astounding degree of autonomy to execute his vision and pursue the core goals of his presidency , asking only for dutiful subservience in return . Their understanding has created an intriguing dynamic in the White House , according to administration officials : Pence switches into alpha-dog mode when Trump leaves the room , commanding meetings with presidential verve . When Trump is in the room , he calls on Pence first to leave no doubt in the minds of Cabinet officials and senior White House staffers who has the keys to the president \u2019 s car when he \u2019 s not driving .\nThe arrangement might prove too tempting for any other ambitious politician . And make no mistake : Pence is ambitious . But he is also humble and self-controlled and devoutly religious , drawing from his faith\u2014and the military tradition that runs in his family\u2014a belief in submission . Notably , Pence emphasized \u201c orientation to authority \u201d as a key component of leadership when addressing the U.S . Naval Academy commencement in May , telling graduates , \u201c Follow the chain of command without exception . Submit yourselves , as the saying goes , to the authorities that have been placed above you . Trust your superiors , trust your orders , and you \u2019 ll serve and lead well. \u201d These sentiments shouldn \u2019 t surprise anyone who has followed Pence \u2019 s career\u2014especially since July of last year . \u201c If you watched him during the campaign , when all that craziness was going on , he was the loyal soldier . And he \u2019 s still the loyal soldier , \u201d former House Speaker John Boehner tells me . \u201c He and his team , they \u2019 ve got their eyes wide open . But he \u2019 s doing a very good job of playing that role . \u201d\nIn fact , this isn \u2019 t unlike how Pence approached his position as conference chairman on Boehner \u2019 s leadership team . There were plenty of times Pence \u201c didn \u2019 t necessarily see eye to eye \u201d with the minority leader , Hensarling recalls , yet Pence maintained the affection of his superiors by keeping those disagreements private . ( Boehner fondly remembers Pence for \u201c always pissing inside the Republican tent , never outside the Republican tent. \u201d ) There was no leaking , no showing up the higher-ranking Republicans . Somehow , Pence emerged from his two years in the GOP leadership\u2014President Barack Obama \u2019 s first two in the White House\u2014equally popular with the party establishment and the insurgency knocking at its door .\nBut Donald Trump is not John Boehner . Pence has expertly navigated the first five months without any reprimands or visits to the president \u2019 s doghouse\u2014which is more than can be said for just about anyone else in the West Wing . But it has been a trying five months , and there are 43 to go in Trump \u2019 s first term . Based on the jittery reactions and hushed tones of the Pence associates I spoke with for this story , they are often walking on eggshells , worrying that something might be perceived as a slight to his mercurial boss . It is unsustainable , they concede , and much of the situation is beyond their control . Ryan has already been asked once\u2014by a respected Fox News reporter , at a televised news conference\u2014whether Republicans would be better off with Pence as president . \u201c Oh , good grief , \u201d the speaker responded . \u201c There \u2019 s not even a point in making a comment on that. \u201d What happens if and when the question is posed to a larger number of GOP lawmakers ? And what happens if and when they answer in the affirmative ?\nIf you watched him during the campaign , when all that craziness was going on , he was the loyal soldier . And he \u2019 s still the loyal soldier. \u201d Former House Speaker John Boehner\nThese fears were fermenting in the vice president \u2019 s inner circle even before he scheduled a summer series of campaign-style rallies in Iowa and other battleground states where talk of future presidential ambitions is never far from the lips of the political class .

    "content_original": "Tim Alberta is national political reporter at Politico Magazine.\n\nRight around the time Donald Trump was boarding Air Force One en route to Saudi Arabia, soon to escape a capital city obsessed with investigations into his campaign\u2019s ties with Russia and the firing of FBI Director James Comey, his vice president was receiving a booming ovation inside a fifth-floor Ritz-Carlton ballroom in the nearby Virginia suburbs. It was the afternoon of May 19, and Mike Pence stood before several hundred members of the Council for National Policy\u2014a secretive group of conservative movement activists, donors and intellectuals that meets under off-the-record rules\u2014and downplayed the perception of a presidency in crisis. \u201cThe truth is, you elected a man who never quits. He never backs down. He\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s a winner,\u201d Pence said, according to an audio recording obtained by Politico Magazine. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make you a promise: No matter what Washington, D.C., might be focused on at any given moment, President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the American people and for advancing an agenda that will make America great again!\u201d\n\nHis audience roared. For those who feared the GOP\u2019s once-in-a-generation opportunity for a policy renaissance was being squandered by infighting and incompetence and the creeping scent of scandal, the vice president\u2019s words, as they so often have during the early days of the Trump administration, provided temporary relief. The performance was vintage Pence. He was grandiose but grounded, hailing a host of early victories but cautioning that the biggest were yet to come; he was authoritative but deferential, speaking for the party and the government while carrying greetings from his boss. Above all, Pence was upbeat, befitting the \u201chappy warrior\u201d persona he has long labored to promote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get through all these accomplishments\u2014unless you\u2019re watching cable news,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cThey never come up, except on one network!\u201d Had Pence not nodded twice to the Beltway media\u2019s preoccupations, one would have had no inkling that Trump was enduring the most perilous stretch of his young presidency\u2014or that Pence appeared at risk of becoming collateral damage.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe night before, on the eve of Trump\u2019s first foreign trip\u2014and Pence\u2019s private speech\u2014two news outlets published a pair of eyebrow-raising stories that reflected mounting anxiety within the vice president\u2019s inner circle. The sourcing and strategy seemed clearly choreographed. First, both articles aimed to distance Pence from the chaos engulfing Trump\u2019s White House; CNN quoted \u201ca senior administration adviser\u201d who said Pence \u201clooks tired\u201d and never expected such mayhem on the job, while NBC cited \u201ca source close to the administration\u201d who complained of a \u201cpattern\u201d of Pence being kept in the dark on matters relating to the scandal-plagued former national security adviser, Mike Flynn. Second, both stories were authored by former Pence \u201cembeds,\u201d reporters who had spent months traveling with him and are expertly sourced among the vice president\u2019s tight-knit team. And third, the news accounts cast Pence in a sympathetic light at the very moment when the D.C. media was, for the first time, beginning to hammer him. The New York Times had reported the day earlier that Flynn informed the Pence-run transition team before Inauguration Day that he was under federal investigation; the implications for Pence were staggering, and the White House categorically denied the story. But Pence had also courted trouble the week earlier by insisting that Trump\u2019s decision to fire Comey was based on the deputy attorney general\u2019s recommendation\u2014a claim Trump promptly contradicted in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, embarrassing the vice president and sending an awkward question echoing around Washington: Is Pence being kept out of the loop, or is he being deceitful?\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence, attached at the hip ... | Getty Images\n\nThe answer, in conversations with more than a dozen people familiar with the vice president\u2019s role in the administration and his relationship with Trump, is actually neither. They concede he has on several occasions been the victim of an uncommunicative White House\u2014and an unpredictable president\u2014that regularly leaves top officials hanging out to dry. They also reject the suggestion that he looks \u201ctired,\u201d though several friends acknowledge that his patience with the West Wing\u2019s dysfunction has worn thin. But whether that pro-Pence leaker told CNN and NBC News the truth is less relevant than the fact there was a pro-Pence leaker at all.\n\nFrom the moment last July when Trump picked Pence as his running mate, through the first five months of this administration, the vice president has been all but invisible in the parade of palace intrigue stories detailing the rivalries, alliances, backstabbing, self-promoting and stock-watching inside Trump\u2019s reality-TV style presidency. That is no accident: Pence made clear to everyone around him when he was picked, and again at the outset of the administration, that the spotlight belongs to Trump. Leaking, speaking out of turn or doing anything that could be perceived as upstaging the president would not be tolerated. \u201cHe laid down the law,\u201d one Pence associate recalls. \u201cThis was going to be about Trump, not him.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the vice president declined to comment for this story.\n\nHis inconspicuousness is engineered to keep all eyes on the president. But it\u2019s also necessary to guard against whispers that he, not Trump, is running the show\u2014a narrative fueled both by Pence\u2019s standing in the party and by the fact that he has been empowered like no vice president before him to establish, sell and execute the administration\u2019s agenda. Five months into the Trump era\u2014and less than a year since he was plucked from a thorny situation in Indiana\u2014Pence, once an endangered small-state governor, has become the most popular Republican in the country and accumulated an astonishing amount of power. He is deeply involved with nearly every major decision coming from the White House, whether it be the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord or the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He is the administration\u2019s most effective and reassuring messenger, often because of his license to clarify or even correct things said by his boss. And he is widely viewed by Republicans on Capitol Hill as the de facto leader of the GOP\u2014not just the safety parachute for a free-falling presidency, but a polished, respected statesman from whom members can take their cues.\n\nMike Pence has a very full and complex portfolio in his briefcase. And he has to carry it like there\u2019s a bottle of nitroglycerin inside.\u201d Ken Blackwell\n\nThis outsized stature, however, also threatens the harmony between Pence and his famously fickle superior. Trump has come to trust his second in command above everyone else in the White House, people close to both men say, prizing Pence\u2019s unwavering loyalty and discretion. And yet the vice president\u2019s camp operates in a continual state of apprehension, having been handed massive responsibilities by a president known for his insecurities and acute sensitivity to being overshadowed. Ken Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state and longtime conservative activist who ran the domestic policy wing of Pence\u2019s transition team, put it this way: \u201cMike Pence has a very full and complex portfolio in his briefcase. And he has to carry it like there\u2019s a bottle of nitroglycerin inside.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nRiding on his campaign plane last October, shortly before a botched landing at La Guardia sent us skidding off the rain-slicked runway, Pence described his first conversation with Trump about joining the ticket. The Indiana governor said he \u201cwanted to know what the job description was, because there\u2019s only one person who writes it, and that\u2019s the president.\u201d Pence declined to share Trump\u2019s answer\u2014I would find out after Election Day\u2014but he did tell me the Republican nominee liked the fact that he had been a governor. \u201cI also think he was impressed with my 12 years in Congress, and [by] the relationships that I enjoy not only with members of the House,\u201d Pence said, \u201cbut also with former members of the House who are now in the Senate.\u201d\n\nThere is no trace of buyer\u2019s remorse. Trump boasts often about his selection of Pence, administration officials say, and feels validated by his performance and the praise it has elicited. Trump has gotten more than just a veteran lawmaker with D.C. connections. In a White House governed by amateurism, if not anarchy, Pence has come to be seen as an island of efficacy and discipline. He has soothed nerves at home and abroad with private chats and public speeches; he has made an art form of normalizing Trump. But nothing has come easily\u2014not for someone riding shotgun during the wildest presidency in modern American history. It\u2019s unclear for now whether those CNN and NBC stories resulted from one overzealous ally freelancing on Pence\u2019s behalf, or from a dam of pent-up frustration among many others beginning to burst. Whatever the case, one thing is obvious to the vice president\u2019s friends: He is getting more than he bargained for. \u201cThe job has been even more challenging than I had thought it might be,\u201d says Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and one of Pence\u2019s closest confidants. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen a political figure in my lifetime take as many body blows as President Trump has. And admittedly, his tweets have probably brought a few upon himself.\u201d (Pence often sees Trump\u2019s tweets for the first time when reading them in the daily news summary put together by his staff.)\n\nGROWING UP PENCE | 1: As a schoolboy, he participated in speech competitions; he is pictured here with a trophy from one. 2: After attending Hanover College in Indiana, Pence, pictured with his father, Ed, earned a law degree from Indiana University in 1986. 3: Mike and Karen Pence were married on June 8, 1985. 4: The Pences would have three children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey. 5: The Pences, pictured here before they were married, met while Mike was attending law school. 6: The couple at the Indianapolis 500. 7: The Pences\u2019 son, Michael, is a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. | Chris Dickson\n\nThese are challenges for which Pence\u2019s disposition, personal worldview and political experience make him uniquely well suited. He is a steady, unemotional influence on the president, friends say, having lost his cool only once\u2014when Flynn lied to him about his contacts with the Russians\u2014and taking care otherwise to always keep a poker face. He preaches and prides himself on loyalty, be it in politics, business or anything else. (Pence\u2019s marriage has made an impression on his boss; people who have spent time with them say Trump has commented approvingly, if quizzically, on how the vice president and second lady are always holding hands.) And Pence has been unfaltering in his belief that Trump is meant to be a transformative character in American political history; even when things looked grim early on election night, Pence texted a \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d cover to some of his pessimistic allies.\n\nPerhaps most important, Pence feels a sincere affection for Trump. He told me last fall that a turning point in their relationship was when the Republican nominee began asking him for periodic prayer sessions, and said he was especially moved when Trump called him the night of the vice presidential debate and left a voicemail saying he had just said a prayer for Pence. Today, White House aides say Trump\u2019s increasingly frequent references to God are unquestionably the product of his spending so much time with his vice president. Their kinship might seem forced, or even phony, but the two men have become closer personally and professionally than anyone in either camp could have imagined a year ago. They speak multiple times a day by phone when physically apart and are often inseparable around the White House; some joke that Pence will become jealous now that Melania Trump has moved in. The bond between them, however unlikely it once seemed, keeps Pence content to forgo accolades even though he\u2019s the one person in Trump\u2019s close orbit whose performance merits them.\n\nUnlike other West Wingers who nurture narratives of their own indispensability\u2014Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Kellyanne Conway, among others\u2014it is Pence, to many Republicans in town, who has unassumingly emerged as the most valuable player in Trump\u2019s White House. If it\u2019s easy to miss, that\u2019s the point. The vice president\u2019s persona\u2014the wholesome, aw-shucks, milk-drinking Midwesterner\u2014masks the skill set of a savvy political operator who grasps the nuances of government in a way that Trump\u2019s team of outsiders cannot hope to, and who understands better than anyone how to survive and thrive in this White House: Get the job done, and avoid all acclaim in the process. In April, for example, when Pence brokered the compromise between conservatives and moderates that allowed the House to improbably pass the American Health Care Act, his office pleaded with lawmakers and outside groups to stop crediting the \u201cPence amendment,\u201d preferring that Trump and Representatives Mark Meadows and Tom MacArthur get the accolades. (The idea for state-based waivers became known as the \u201cMacArthur amendment.\u201d) Pence worked to ensure that evangelical leaders were brought into the fold in the first days of the administration and then nudged Trump to deliver on their pet issues of abortion and religious liberty, all while privately touting the president to those audiences as an unrelenting champion for traditional values. And given tremendous latitude as head of the transition, Pence helped stock the administration with like-minded allies, including many of his own loyalists\u2014giving the vice president eyes and ears and influence across the federal government\u2014only to lavish praise on Trump as the visionary who assembled the most conservative Cabinet ever.\n\nThe president likes people who don\u2019t showboat ... And the president loves killers\u2014he loves people who get things done.\u201d Senior Trump administration aide\n\nIt is Pence whom Trump calls on first during almost every meeting. It is Pence whose opinion Trump solicits before every big decision. It is Pence who has emerged as the essential supporting actor in Trump\u2019s presidency. And it is Pence who says the very least about it.\n\n\u201cThink about this,\u201d a senior administration aide tells me. \u201cThe president likes people who don\u2019t showboat, who don\u2019t call attention to themselves. And the president loves killers\u2014he loves people who get things done.\u201d A long pause. \u201cMike Pence is the quiet killer in this White House. And Trump loves him for it.\u201d\n\nIf doing that job for a boss like Trump is the equivalent of walking a tightrope, it could get narrower in a hurry. Nobody expects Pence, who just turned 58, to suddenly usurp the president in any way; that\u2019s just not who he is. But people close to him understand that with each new layer of legal jeopardy Trump encounters, be it in relation to Russia, Comey, Flynn, any combination of the three or something else entirely, the murmurs of \u201cPresident Pence\u201d will only grow louder. (After weeks of deliberation, Pence in mid-June followed Trump\u2019s lead in hiring an outside counsel to deal with the expanding Russia-related inquiries.) The president\u2019s precarious situation, coupled with Pence\u2019s recent burst of political activity\u2014in May he formed a new PAC, the Great America Committee; his summer calendar is littered with campaign swings on behalf of prominent lawmakers; he has been hosting intimate dinners with key activists and donors; and there are discussions underway about reengaging with his old friends Charles and David Koch\u2014might produce a perception that becomes unmanageable for the vice president\u2019s team. Republicans on Capitol Hill already operate as though Pence sits atop the party, and some have recently begun gossiping with a surprising lack of discretion about their expectation that the 71-year-old Trump will decline to seek reelection in 2020. What little buzz about President Pence exists in the GOP has less to do with impeachment than it does with speculation that Trump might simply tire of the White House and hand the reins to his deputy.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

His aides now insist it\u2019s the furthest thing from his mind, that his sole focus is promoting the president\u2019s agenda. That is probably true. But with every new investigative drip that damages Trump, with every utterance of the I-word, with every self-immolating tweet and, at the very least, with every passing day of this presidency, the GOP will more and more look to Pence as next in line\u2014a reality that his friends privately acknowledge they have begun to reckon with, and one that the vice president can\u2019t afford to ignore.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know when his time will be\u2014it could be seven-and-a-half years, it could be seven-and-a-half months,\u201d another West Wing official says of Pence. \u201cBut he had better be ready.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nNobody seems to know how Pence discovered where the House Freedom Caucus was meeting. It was March 24, the day of the House GOP\u2019s failed first attempt at repealing Obamacare, and as Speaker Paul Ryan met with Trump at the White House to explain that their bill didn\u2019t have enough votes to pass, the Freedom Caucus\u2019 roughly three dozen members filed into a private room at the Capitol Hill Club. They wanted to plot their next move in secret; to avoid leaks, no aides, other lawmakers or White House officials were told of their location. Not long after they had gathered, however, the door was flung open and in marched Pence. He was accompanied by Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and neither man was smiling.\n\nThere was a reason Vice President Pence, along with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, was sent to Capitol Hill in April to broker a deal with House Republicans over their bill to repeal Obamacare: Pence has a long history in the conservative wing of the GOP. | Getty Images\n\nWith the American Health Care Act breathing its last\u2014that is, until Pence resuscitated it over the ensuing weeks\u2014the vice president pleaded with his fellow tea partiers to reconsider their opposition. When they held their ground, the vice president let loose an uncharacteristic flash of anger. \u201cI was the Freedom Caucus before the Freedom Caucus existed,\u201d Pence told them, his voice rising, according to multiple people who were in the room. \u201cDon\u2019t try to tell me this bill isn\u2019t conservative enough.\u201d\n\nIt was the most animated they had ever seen him. And it worked: After Pence abruptly exited the meeting, and several grown men had broken into tears because of the tension present in the room, a chorus of Freedom Caucus members informed Chairman Meadows that they would now support the legislation if a vote were held. It turned out to be too late\u2014Ryan\u2019s team had already hemorrhaged a huge number of moderates, and the AHCA never saw the floor that day\u2014but Pence\u2019s power play was not lost on a group of lawmakers who pride themselves on defying their party\u2019s leadership. \u201cThere were a number of our people who would have voted with the vice president based on that meeting,\u201d Meadows tells me. \u201cThere were House Freedom Caucus members willing to support the bill, despite great reservations, because of Vice President Pence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when you disagree with him, you want to agree with him, because it\u2019s Mike Pence,\u201d says Jim Jordan, the founding chairman of the Freedom Caucus. He was a Pence pupil upon coming to Congress in 2007 and eventually joined him in the fraternity of lawmakers who chaired the Republican Study Committee, a group that housed the conservative rebellion before the Freedom Caucus spun off as a smaller coterie of hard-liners. Jordan wasn\u2019t moved by Pence\u2019s final plea, but he could tell other members were. \u201cThe fact that the vice president was encouraging us to support it made it that much harder to be against it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it made us want to work that much harder to get it done. That\u2019s what happened: The waiver idea started with Mike.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the proposal to allow states to opt out of certain Obamacare requirements\u2014a key modification after the first Republican bill flopped\u2014originated not with MacArthur, who then chaired the moderate Tuesday Group caucus, but with Pence. The vice president had begun lobbying Trump immediately after the March 24 debacle to let him keep pursuing a health care deal. With the president\u2019s blessing, Pence\u2019s office drafted the language, and he shared it separately with the conservatives and centrists before calling a joint meeting to iron out details that were lost in translation (or, as some suspected, that were presented somewhat differently just to get the two factions talking).\n\nYou could see the discomfort on his face when he was playing the mediator when in his heart he wanted to side with the conservatives.\u201d A longtime Pence friend on Capitol Hill\n\nThis, to many Pence allies, has been the trickiest part of his new job: shedding his ideological bias as a deeply rooted movement conservative so that he can carry Trump\u2019s message to, and build trust with, other elements of the GOP. \u201cThere was a lot of conservative angst with Pence during the first AHCA fight\u2014we knew he wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if he were still in Congress,\u201d says one longtime friend on Capitol Hill. \u201cAnd you could see the discomfort on his face when he was playing the mediator when in his heart he wanted to side with the conservatives.\u201d At the same time, though, moderates appreciated how Pence gave them space, knowing their districts were different from the sort he used to represent. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to help without going too far,\u201d MacArthur told the Indianapolis Star shortly before the revised bill passed.\n\nOf course, abject neutrality from the vice president would be of little use to this White House. With little margin for error in a polarized Congress, Pence enjoys singular leverage as a liaison between Trump World\u2014which is heavily populated by social liberals and establishment Republicans\u2014and the conservatives who can vote as a bloc to derail the president's agenda. \u201cBannon tried to bark orders at us. Priebus is a nervous nelly who doesn\u2019t want to lose proximity to the president because he thinks he\u2019s going to lose his job. His family members have no street cred with conservatives. And none of us trusts Gary Cohn,\u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me. \u201cSo we look around for someone we can trust, and Mike is the go-to guy.\u201d\n\nAlthough he would not enter Congress until 2001, Pence first ran for a House seat in 1988, and met with President Ronald Reagan during the campaign. \u201cI felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore!\u201d Pence later said. | Newscom\n\nThis dynamic has occasionally made things uncomfortable for Pence, such as when conservative outside groups bludgeoned the first health care bill, prompting him to vent to allies about their motivations. Or when Trump, on the heels of that health care defeat, sent several tweets targeting individual Freedom Caucus members and calling for their defeat in 2018. Pence met with the group several days later, and lawmakers voiced their displeasure with the White House. They hoped the vice president would sympathize\u2014having once been in their shoes, a conservative congressman voting against his party\u2019s president\u2014but were surprised when, after Meadows pressed him for an informal agreement to end the administration\u2019s broadsides against the Freedom Caucus, a stone-faced Pence answered simply, \u201cI\u2019ll pass that along to the president.\u201d\n\nIt was a no-win situation for Pence: Fox Business published an account of the meeting saying he had apologized to the Freedom Caucus for the president\u2019s tweets, which he had not, and the vice president\u2019s office sprang into damage-control mode to refute the suggestion\u2014internally dangerous for Pence\u2014that the vice president had undermined Trump by apologizing for his actions. At the same time, an apology was precisely what some members wanted, and they left upset that Pence hadn\u2019t offered one.\n\n\n\n***\n\nNot coincidentally, Trump\u2019s menacing tweets aimed at Capitol Hill ceased thereafter. Pence\u2019s role in squashing the president\u2019s feud with Freedom Caucus members\u2014and then helping to pass the bill whose initial failure had sparked it\u2014validates Trump\u2019s choice of running mate. But in puzzling out their relationship, that was only one part of the equation: It explained why Pence was attractive to Trump, but not why Trump\u2019s vice presidency was appealing to Pence. It wasn\u2019t until months after our brush with disaster at LaGuardia that a senior campaign official told me what Trump\u2019s job description of the vice presidency had been. \u201cHe told Pence he wanted \u2018the most consequential vice president ever,\u2019\u201d the source recalled of their meeting. \u201cThose were his words.\u201d\n\nPence, of course, had other reasons to join the ticket: His governorship in Indiana was derailed by the mishandling of religious freedom legislation, and although he was more likely than not to win reelection in 2016, his approval rating was underwater statewide. His deputies were preparing for a nasty, negative slog of a campaign. The chance for a fresh start, on the national stage no less, would seem more than enough for someone in Pence\u2019s position\u2014even without Trump promising to make him chief operating officer and arguably the shadow president of his administration.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth and a former Indiana congressman who has known Pence for decades, says of his working relationship with the president. \u201cDuring the campaign, Trump put Pence in a unique position for any vice presidential candidate I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime \u2026 and that continued when they were sworn in to office: Trump trusted Pence to be loyal [because] he was willing to give him a lot of authority.\u201d\n\nThis is essential to understanding their relationship: Trump has given his vice president an astounding degree of autonomy to execute his vision and pursue the core goals of his presidency, asking only for dutiful subservience in return. Their understanding has created an intriguing dynamic in the White House, according to administration officials: Pence switches into alpha-dog mode when Trump leaves the room, commanding meetings with presidential verve. When Trump is in the room, he calls on Pence first to leave no doubt in the minds of Cabinet officials and senior White House staffers who has the keys to the president\u2019s car when he\u2019s not driving.\n\nBuddy act | Donald Trump and Mike Pence arrive in Indianapolis before visiting the Carrier Corporation in December. | Getty Images\n\nThe arrangement might prove too tempting for any other ambitious politician. And make no mistake: Pence is ambitious. But he is also humble and self-controlled and devoutly religious, drawing from his faith\u2014and the military tradition that runs in his family\u2014a belief in submission. Notably, Pence emphasized \u201corientation to authority\u201d as a key component of leadership when addressing the U.S. Naval Academy commencement in May, telling graduates, \u201cFollow the chain of command without exception. Submit yourselves, as the saying goes, to the authorities that have been placed above you. Trust your superiors, trust your orders, and you\u2019ll serve and lead well.\u201d These sentiments shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has followed Pence\u2019s career\u2014especially since July of last year. \u201cIf you watched him during the campaign, when all that craziness was going on, he was the loyal soldier. And he\u2019s still the loyal soldier,\u201d former House Speaker John Boehner tells me. \u201cHe and his team, they\u2019ve got their eyes wide open. But he\u2019s doing a very good job of playing that role.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this isn\u2019t unlike how Pence approached his position as conference chairman on Boehner\u2019s leadership team. There were plenty of times Pence \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily see eye to eye\u201d with the minority leader, Hensarling recalls, yet Pence maintained the affection of his superiors by keeping those disagreements private. (Boehner fondly remembers Pence for \u201calways pissing inside the Republican tent, never outside the Republican tent.\u201d) There was no leaking, no showing up the higher-ranking Republicans. Somehow, Pence emerged from his two years in the GOP leadership\u2014President Barack Obama\u2019s first two in the White House\u2014equally popular with the party establishment and the insurgency knocking at its door.\n\nBut Donald Trump is not John Boehner. Pence has expertly navigated the first five months without any reprimands or visits to the president\u2019s doghouse\u2014which is more than can be said for just about anyone else in the West Wing. But it has been a trying five months, and there are 43 to go in Trump\u2019s first term. Based on the jittery reactions and hushed tones of the Pence associates I spoke with for this story, they are often walking on eggshells, worrying that something might be perceived as a slight to his mercurial boss. It is unsustainable, they concede, and much of the situation is beyond their control. Ryan has already been asked once\u2014by a respected Fox News reporter, at a televised news conference\u2014whether Republicans would be better off with Pence as president. \u201cOh, good grief,\u201d the speaker responded. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a point in making a comment on that.\u201d What happens if and when the question is posed to a larger number of GOP lawmakers? And what happens if and when they answer in the affirmative?\n\nIf you watched him during the campaign, when all that craziness was going on, he was the loyal soldier. And he\u2019s still the loyal soldier.\u201d Former House Speaker John Boehner\n\nThese fears were fermenting in the vice president\u2019s inner circle even before he scheduled a summer series of campaign-style rallies in Iowa and other battleground states where talk of future presidential ambitions is never far from the lips of the political class. Before he formed the Great America Committee, which was on the advice of lawyers looking to make efficient use of cash but nonetheless reeked of political positioning. (Pence aides have emphasized that the PAC\u2019s first donation was to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.) Before treacherous headlines appeared in the Washington Post (\u201c\u2018President Pence\u2019 is sounding better and better\u201d), USA Today (\u201cPoll: President Trump is his own worst spokesman, Pence does better job\u201d), Axios (\u201cFamed short-seller believes markets have priced in President Pence\u201d). And certainly before one of the vice president\u2019s allies attempted to distance him from the administration in CNN and NBC News.\n\nFriends of Pence remind me that, before assuming the vice presidency, he looked to George H.W. Bush\u2014not Dick Cheney or Dan Quayle, two men Pence knows personally\u2014as the model for his approach to the job. They say the point he was making is about the man Bush 41 served, Ronald Reagan, and the parallels Pence sees with his own boss. But there\u2019s another point worth considering: Neither Cheney nor Quayle ever became president. George H.W. Bush did.\n\nIn reality, Pence\u2019s role is more like Cheney\u2019s than any recent vice president, Republicans say, given the considerable influence he wielded under George W. Bush. \u201cBut remember,\u201d Blackwell adds, \u201cCheney\u2019s relationship with W. became fragile when people started to project Cheney as being in charge.\u201d",
