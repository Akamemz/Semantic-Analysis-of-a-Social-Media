The plan , which has yet to be submitted to and approved by President Obama , comes amid growing pressure on the US and other Western nations to intervene directly in Iraq to prevent a massacre of the Yazidi minority and to help Kurdish forces repel IS .\nA US rescue mission would risk putting American forces into direct conflict with IS fighters , but US officials warn such a move might become necessary if supply drops by Western powers to the Yazidis , currently under siege on Mt .
