    "content": "Why are libertarians so overwhelmingly white and male ? This is a question that Jeet Heer of The New Republic explored last Friday , after a new CNN poll found that presidential hopeful Rand Paul , who happens to be the favorite among libertarians , is very competitive in the primaries amongst male voters , but almost completely rejected by females . This is a problem that has long haunted conservatism , but it is even more drastic for ultra-right wing libertarianism . In a 2014 Pew poll , it was found that about one in ten Americans describe themselves as libertarian , and men were more than twice as likely to be libertarians . In a 2013 Pew poll that Heer states in his article , it was found about two-thirds ( 68 percent ) of American \u2019 s who identify as libertarians are men , and 94 percent are non-hispanic whites . Compare this to `` steadfast conservatives , '' who were found to be 59 percent male and 87 percent white , or `` business conservatives , '' found to be 62 percent male and 85 percent white , according to another survey done by Pew . Clearly , the entire conservative movement is dominated by white males , but libertarians are the most male-dominated . Obviously this is a major problem for anyone who is hoping for libertarianism to take off in American politics . So why are libertarians mostly white guys ? Heer points out a few different possibilities that some libertarian writers have offered . One of them being that libertarianism has attracted many male-dominated subcultures , like computer programming ( think Silicon Valley ) , gaming , mens-rights activists , and organized humanism/Atheism , and another , argued by Katherine Mangu-Ward , that libertarianism has long been a fringe movement , and fringe movements tend to be dominated by men . Okay , so libertarianism attracts nerdy white males , but surely these are not the only ones making up the dedicated crowd ? While looking at the larger conservative movement , it becomes a bit more clear that the hostility towards government and collective movements in general tends to attract white males who want to preserve their dominance in a society where they are quickly becoming minorities .\nTake the following passage written by a young libertarian activist :\n\u201c [ E ] very piece of anti-discrimination legislation passed over the past few decades , ignores one of the basic , inalienable rights of man \u2014 the right to discriminate . [ Though ] eliminating racial and sexual prejudice [ had ] noble aspiration , [ anti-discrimination laws ] necessarily utilize the ignoble means of coercive force . \u201d\nThat young activist ? Rand Paul in 1982 . Sure , that was more than three decades ago , and its not fair to go after someone for something they wrote back in those naive college days . But has Paul \u2019 s outlook changed at all ? Not really . In his now infamous interview with Rachel Maddow , he admitted that he had a major problem with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , particularly the provisions that \u201c harbor in on private businesses and their policies. \u201d In other words , he didn \u2019 t like the government telling businesses that they had to serve black people . According to libertarians , this is a clear violation of one 's freedom to discriminate ; that if a business owner does not want to serve a black person , that is their right . Of course this kind of philosophy is going to be very attractive to those racist business owners .\nLibertarianism is inherently opposed to collective movements , and collective movements have long fought to achieve equal rights for women , minorities , workers , etc . Is it any surprise that libertarianism attracts white ( and generally privileged ) men ? If we take a look at the larger conservative movement , a similar story presents itself .\nLast year , a study at Northwestern University found that white , independent-minded American \u2019 s tended to shift towards conservatism when they found out that demographic changes would be making them minorities . \u201c Perceived group-status threat , triggered by exposure to majority-minority shift , increases Whites \u2019 endorsement of conservative political ideology and policy positions , \u201d wrote the researchers , Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson .

You may remember hearing about Rockwell because of his association with Ron Paul .
