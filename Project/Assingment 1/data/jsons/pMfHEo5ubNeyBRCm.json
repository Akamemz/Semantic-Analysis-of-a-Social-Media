    "content": "Maine voters will participate in the largest , most consequential primary day of the 2020 presidential elections on Tuesday and also decide whether to keep or reject a law on mandatory childhood vaccinations .\nThis will be the first presidential primary election since Maine dropped the more complicated and time-consuming caucus system . And while the state hasn \u2019 t received much in-person attention from the candidates , Maine \u2019 s participation in the Super Tuesday primaries means registered Democrats will be casting their ballots at at time when their party \u2019 s nomination contest is still wide open .\nPolling times Most polls for Tuesday \u2019 s Maine presidential primary open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. statewide . Vaccine Referendum A \u201c yes \u201d vote on Question 1 would overturn the new vaccine law and allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for religious or philosophical reasons . A \u201c no \u201d vote would keep the law on the books , thereby requiring vaccinations before children can attend school except when a doctor grants a medical exemption .\n\u201c I think people are excited to go out and vote , \u201d said Maine Senate President Troy Jackson , D-Allagash , who is a state co-chairman of the Bernie Sanders campaign . \u201c I don \u2019 t think they like the way the country is going right now . \u201d\nRegistered Democrats will have their choice of six candidates on Tuesday \u2019 s ballot who are still actively campaigning for the party \u2019 s nomination : Joe Biden , Michael Bloomberg , Tulsi Gabbard , Amy Klobuchar , Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg dropped out over the weekend following the primary in South Carolina . Biden \u2019 s campaign appeared to be re-energized after his landslide win there , giving his supporters more hope headed into Super Tuesday .\nRepublicans will also technically hold a presidential primary but with only one contender in Maine : President Trump .\nFourteen states along with American Samoa and Democrats living abroad will participate in Super Tuesday . Those states account for roughly one-third of the Democratic delegates up for grabs in the nominating process thanks , in large part , to the involvement of such populous states as California , Texas and North Carolina .\nMaine is running \u201c closed primaries \u201d this year , meaning that only individuals registered as a Democrat or Republican can cast ballots in those respective party contests . Unenrolled voters can join a party at the polls , as can individuals registering to vote for the first time on Election Day . But registered Democrats , Republicans or Green Independent voters can not change their party affiliation at the polls in order to participate in another primary .\nBut there is another issue on the statewide ballot in which all registered voters can participate .\nQuestion 1 on the ballot is a \u201c people \u2019 s veto \u201d effort organized by groups that want to preserve parents \u2019 ability to claim religious or philosophical exemptions to Maine \u2019 s law requiring that children receive a bevy of vaccinations before attending school .\nLast year after a contentious legislative battle , Gov . Janet Mills signed into law a bill that eliminates those religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccinations . Supporters said closing the exemptions was a necessary step to reverse an alarming drop in the number of children who enter schools without receiving vaccinations against pertussis , measles and other preventable diseases . Maintaining the \u201c herd immunity \u201d created by high vaccination rates also helps to protect children with weakened immune systems .\nBut opponents of the law collected enough signatures to send the issue to voters , arguing the mandate violates parental rights .\nAs with other \u201c people \u2019 s veto \u201d campaigns , groups on both sides having been battling voter confusion about the question \u2019 s wording headed into Tuesday .\nA \u201c yes \u201d vote on Question 1 would overturn the law and allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for religious or philosophical reasons . A \u201c no \u201d vote would keep the law on the books , thereby requiring vaccinations before children can attend school except when a doctor grants a medical exemption .\nWith just 24 Democratic delegates up for grabs , Maine is the third-smallest prize for presidential hopefuls on Super Tuesday after Vermont and American Samoa . California , by comparison , has 415 delegates at play while Massachusetts has 91 delegates .\nThat likely helps explain why relatively few presidential candidates have campaigned in Maine this year , although several candidates or their national surrogates were making last-minute trips to the Pine Tree State .\nOn Saturday , Klobuchar addressed a crowd of several hundred people in Portland .\nThe Minnesota senator , who is battling Biden and Bloomberg for the moderate vote , emphasized her rural roots and experience at the local , state and national levels . Throughout her campaign , Klobuchar has also pointed to her election victories in both rural and urban Minnesota as well as her track record of accomplishments in the sharply divided Senate .\n\u201c I think Maine , that practical state that you are , understands that it \u2019 s important to have bold ideas that can actually get done , \u201d Klobuchar said .\nIn 2016 , Sanders easily defeated rival Hillary Clinton during Maine \u2019 s Democratic caucuses , winning 64 percent of the vote on a day when heavy turnout overwhelmed organizers at some caucus locations . The chaotic scene in Portland at several other caucus locations was a driving force behind the push to switch back to a presidential primary .\nThis year , Sanders is competing against five other Democrats who are still in the race .
