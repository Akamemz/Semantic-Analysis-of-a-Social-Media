It was because they played clips showing him attacking ObamaCare , and therefore got his message out to people who don \u2019 t watch \u201c Meet the Press \u201d or Fox News , which he was also on yesterday .\nCruz , who has done more than anyone else in Washington to take us to the brink in this budget impasse , says he doesn \u2019 t want to close down the federal government .

Since the brinkmanship could be settled in five minutes if both parties would compromise, it must be in someone\u2019s interest to close the doors for the first time in 17 years.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\n- The media: Though journalists have covered one fiscal cliff too many, the sharp rhetoric, faux filibuster and countdown clocks make for a good story. If the White House and Congress strike a last-minute deal, the story is over -- well, until the debt ceiling showdown in two weeks.\n\nIf there\u2019s no deal, the media will be awash in pieces about shuttered national parks, anxious seniors, angry tourists, furloughed workers, and frantic negotiations to re-open the doors.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Fourth Estate is pining for a shutdown, just pointing out that ratings go up during disasters.\n\n- President Obama: It\u2019s not exactly the worst outcome for the Democrats if the government shuts down, especially if it\u2019s only for a few days.
