The FBI interviewed Tsarnaev , his parents , and the people he went to school with , Graham said Monday .\n`` They put his name through the system and they sent back this information to the Russians and said , 'Do you have anything else ? ' And they never got a reply back , '' he said .\nGraham was also fuming Sunday that a red flag was n't placed on Tsarnaev when he left the country the following a year . But on Monday , he said that was apparently because of a misspelling reported by the Russian airline , Aeroflot .\n`` It did n't get into the system because of a misspelling , '' he told CNN . `` Now whether or not he intentionally changed his name or Aeroflot just got the spelling wrong , I do n't know .
