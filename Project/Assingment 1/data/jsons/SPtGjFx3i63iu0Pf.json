    "content": "The Justice Department 's internal watchdog has concluded that James Comey defied authority at times during his tenure as FBI director , according to sources familiar with a draft report on the matter .\nInterested in James Comey ? Add James Comey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest James Comey news , video , and analysis from \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Add Interest\nOne source told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the draft report explicitly used the word `` insubordinate '' to describe Comey 's behavior . Another source agreed with that characterization but could not confirm the use of the term .\nIn the draft report , Inspector General Michael Horowitz also rebuked former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for her handling of the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton 's personal email server , the sources said .\nOn Tuesday morning , President Donald Trump complained of `` numerous delays '' in the release of Horowitz 's final report , which is expected to run several hundred pages long and be released in the coming days . The sources who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 were willing or able to address only a portion of the draft report 's complete findings .\n`` What is taking so long with the Inspector General 's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey , '' Trump said on Twitter . `` Hope report is not being changed and made weaker ! ''\nThere is no indication the president has seen \u2013 or will see \u2013 a draft of the report before its release . Horowitz , however , could revise the draft report now that current and former officials mentioned in it have offered their responses to the inspector general 's conclusions , according to the sources .\nAlmost from the start , the long-awaited report was expected to chastise Comey for his handling of the Clinton-related probe . But in apparently describing Comey 's defiance of authority , the draft report was criticizing a man who prided himself on his leadership style at the FBI and has since dedicated his post-government life to promoting a new generation of effective leaders .\nThe draft of Horowitz 's wide-ranging report specifically called out Comey for ignoring objections from the Justice Department when he disclosed in a letter to Congress just days before the 2016 presidential election that FBI agents had reopened the Clinton probe , according to sources . Clinton has said that letter doomed her campaign .\nBefore Comey sent the letter to Congress , at least one senior Justice Department official told the FBI that publicizing the bombshell move so close to an election would violate longstanding department policy , and it would ignore federal guidelines prohibiting the disclosure of information related to an ongoing investigation , \u2588\u2588\u2588 was told .\nIn an interview in April , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Comey : `` If Attorney General Lynch had ordered you not to send the letter , would you have sent it ? ''\n`` No , '' Comey responded . `` I believe in the chain of command . ''\nBut in backing Trump 's ultimate decision to fire Comey last year , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein slammed Comey 's letter to Congress and said it `` was wrong '' for Comey `` to usurp the Attorney General 's authority '' when he announced in July 2016 that the FBI would not be filing charges against Clinton or her aides .\n`` It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement , '' Rosenstein said in a letter to Trump recommending Comey be fired . `` At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ''\nHorowitz 's draft report cited Comey for failing to consult with Lynch and other senior Justice Department officials before making his announcement on national TV . While saying there was no `` clear evidence '' that Clinton `` intended to violate '' the law , Comey insisted the former secretary of state was `` extremely careless '' in her `` handling of very sensitive , highly classified information . ''\n`` I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government . They do not know what I am about to say , '' Comey said before cameras on July 5 , 2016 .\nBy then , Lynch had taken the unusual step of publicly declaring she would accept the FBI 's recommendations in the case , after an impromptu meeting with former president Bill Clinton sparked questions about her impartiality .\nComey has defended his decisions as director , insisting he was trying to protect the FBI from even further criticism and `` did n't see that I had a choice . ''\n`` The honest answer is I screwed up a couple of things , but ... I think given what I knew at the time , these were the decisions that were best calculated to preserve the values of the institutions , '' Comey told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` I still think it was the right thing to do . ''\nMore than a year ago , as lawmakers increasingly voiced concern over how the FBI and Justice Department handled matters surrounding the 2016 election , the inspector general 's office announced that it had launched an investigation into an array of allegations , including an allegation `` that Department or FBI policies or procedures were not followed in connection with , or in actions leading up to or related to , the FBI Director 's public announcement on July 5 , 2016 . ''\nA week before the announcement , while the investigation into Hillary Clinton was still underway , a political firestorm erupted in Washington after Lynch happened to run into Bill Clinton in Arizona and briefly met with him inside a plane sitting on a tarmac there . Days later , with questions swirling over whether Bill Clinton tried to improperly influence the investigation into his wife , Lynch haphazardly announced that she would not recuse herself from the matter but would `` fully expect to accept '' whatever recommendation the FBI made .\nComey later called it a `` tortured half-out , half-in approach . '' And after such a `` strange '' announcement , `` I decided I have to step away from her and show the American people the FBI 's work separately , '' Comey told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe inspector general 's office seemed to similarly view Lynch 's announcement as strange , with the draft report criticizing her for how she handled the impromptu tarmac meeting and its aftermath , according to sources familiar with the findings .\nIn April , when Comey was promoting his new book `` A Higher Loyalty , '' Lynch issued a statement saying that during the Clinton email investigation she `` trusted '' the `` non-partisan career prosecutors '' handling the case `` to assess the facts and make a recommendation -- one that I ultimately accepted because I thought the evidence and law warranted it . ''\nNevertheless , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has confirmed that Horowitz 's draft report went on to criticize senior FBI officials , including Comey and fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe , for their response to the late discovery of a laptop containing evidence that may have related to the Clinton investigation .\nThat discovery prompted the FBI 's letter to Congress announcing the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email probe . Hundreds of thousands of emails had been found on the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner , whose wife , Huma Abedin , was a top aide to the secretary of state .\nIt took weeks for the FBI to start analyzing the laptop 's contents , and Horowitz 's draft report criticized senior FBI officials for how long the laptop languished inside the bureau , sources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe Associated Press first reported that the draft report criticized senior FBI officials for their handling of the laptop .\nMcCabe was fired from the FBI in March , after Horowitz concluded in a separate report that McCabe `` lacked candor '' when speaking to internal investigators about his role in a disclosure to the media . The matter has since been referred to the U.S. attorney in Washington for possible prosecution , and McCabe 's legal team is now seeking a grant of immunity from lawmakers who want him to testify before a Senate panel about Horowitz 's findings .\nTalking with \u2588\u2588\u2588 about his own firing , Comey said he decided to write a book afterward because , `` It occurred to me maybe I can be useful by offering a view to people , especially to young people , of what leadership should look like and how it should be centered on values .
