    "content": "Orrin Hatch , one of the senior Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee , is on a one-man mission to save the American judiciary . As Hatch sees it , this branch of government is under terrible and imminent threat from a malign force that threatens to undermine its legitimacy and corrode the foundations of American democracy . What evil power could produce such menacing terror ? What fantastical horror can possibly align itself against the institutions of American justice ?\nIn a Bloomberg Op-Ed this week , Hatch writes about a harrowing experience he went through at the \u201c monthly lunch meeting \u201d of \u201c a well-respected legal organization. \u201d He had been invited there to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy left by the late Antonin Scalia , when , without warning , a group of protesters \u201c holding professionally printed signs \u201d began chanting \u201c do your job \u201d at the senator . They were protesting the decision by Hatch and other Republican leaders to deny President Obama \u2019 s nominee to replace Scalia , appeals court Judge Merrick Garland , a confirmation hearing .\nAs Hatch writes , those protesters and their suspiciously well-printed signs were all the confirmation he needed that obstructing Garland \u2019 s nomination is the right thing to do :\nNow that a majority of states have held presidential primaries , and as this hostile election cycle turns from those contests to general election , organized disruptions of any thoughtful discussion about the Supreme Court will only intensify . Make no mistake : These protesters are not interested in seeing the Senate take seriously its constitutional duty to provide advice about , and determine whether to give or withhold consent to , a consequential Supreme Court nomination . They care little about the Senate operating as a check and balance to the executive branch and instead simply insist that the Republican-led Senate do what progressive activists want and rubber-stamp a presidential appointment .\nAh , the beauty of motivated reasoning . Hatch and his buddies shut down the nominating process because they claims they \u2019 re concerned about politicization , and when Hatch is protested for adopting this controversial stance , he claims justification by pointing to the political reaction he provoked . \u201c The liberal left is seeking to bully the Republican-led Senate into ignoring its constitutional responsibilities and further destroying our nation 's delicate system of checks and balances , \u201d Hatch concludes . \u201c I am more resolved than ever to move forward with the confirmation process only after this toxic election season is over . \u201d\nThis is a variation of the argument Judiciary Committee chairman Sen.

Both Hatch and Grassley want to obstruct the nominating process and make it seem like the reaction to their obstruction \u2013 protests and the routine business of governing \u2013 is the real abuse of power . It \u2019 s too clever by half : if they \u2019 d allow hearings to go forward , the \u201c politicization \u201d they \u2019 re complaining about from Democrats and liberals wouldn \u2019 t be happening .\nJust as significant as the weakness of their arguments is the fact that they keep having to go back to the well to defend their position . Blocking a Supreme Court nomination for the length of time Republicans have in mind was never going to be an easy sell politically , but they determined that it would be worth a little political trouble to prevent Obama from getting another court pick . But they \u2019 re already absorbing a ton of damage over this , and cracks are forming in the obstructionist wall .\nVulnerable blue-state Republican senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are running into angry constituents and are being forced to break with the Republican leadership . Toomey said this week that he \u2019 ll agree to a meeting with Garland \u201c out of courtesy and respect for both the president and the judge. \u201d Others , like Sen.
