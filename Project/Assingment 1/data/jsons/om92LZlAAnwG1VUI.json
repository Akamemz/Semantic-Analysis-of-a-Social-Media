Keystone foes pin hopes on Obama\nGreen activists aren \u2019 t resigned to losing the Keystone battle . But Friday \u2019 s latest blow was yet another disappointment in their often strained relationship with President Barack Obama .\nThe new State Department report that discounted most of the environmental community \u2019 s warnings about the Keystone XL oil pipeline puts the final decision on the project closer to Obama \u2019 s desk , after years in which he \u2019 s been able to dodge rendering a verdict .\nIt all may come down to which Obama makes the final call : the president who declared in Tuesday \u2019 s State of the Union that \u201c climate change is a fact \u201d or the one who , in the same speech , touted an \u201c all of the above \u201d approach to energy policy \u2014 a phrase that environmentalists had specifically urged him to stop using .\nThis is also the same White House that picked health care over a giant cap-and-trade bill in 2010 but three years later launched the biggest-ever regulatory attack on carbon pollution from coal-burning power plants .\nAdding to the tension for deep-pocketed , politically connected greens is the fact that Friday \u2019 s unwelcome message on Keystone came from a department led by one of their most passionate champions , Secretary of State John Kerry .\nSome environmentalists fumed , while others looked for silver linings , including some additional language in the sprawling final document that could be used to bolster their arguments .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just a study ; it doesn \u2019 t recommend a course of action , \u201d said Kenny Bruno , a lead spokesman in the campaign against tapping Canadian oil sands . Pipeline critics , he said , have \u201c the winds at our backs \u201d because the decision is \u201c no longer in the hands of lower-level bureaucrats in the State Department . It \u2019 s in the hands of climate champions Barack Obama and John Kerry . \u201d\nSierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the analysis gives Obama and Kerry \u201c everything \u201d they need to reject the pipeline . \u201c We are cautiously confident that he will make the right choice , \u201d Brune said of Obama .\nThe analysis is \u201c just an input , \u201d billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer said . \u201c So we don \u2019 t have an answer yet , and the fight is far from over . \u201d\nBut others denounced the entire review process so far as corrupt and flawed .\n\u201c This document will be seen by the entire environmental community \u2014 in which I certainly include myself \u2014 as a sham , \u201d said Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D-Ariz. ) . He was one of several Keystone opponents who complained about news reports in which oil industry groups or Canadian officials offered previews of what they had heard the study would say .\n\u201c The fact that the Canadian government and the oil industry were reportedly briefed on today \u2019 s news before Congress was given the courtesy of a heads-up speaks volumes , \u201d Grijalva said . \u201c It encourages the already widely held impression that the fix was in from the beginning . If the administration expects to avoid the lasting stink of having ignored every red flag in the book , it needs to explain itself . \u201d\nThe added details in the final version will allow Obama and Kerry to use them as they see fit , said one former Obama administration official closely following the Keystone process .\n\u201c I think it would be wrong to conclude that this is a rubber stamp for the project and right to conclude it provides additional information that the administration will be looking at before a final decision is made , \u201d the former official said . \u201c The administration is looking to keep its options open here . \u201d\nObama has offered some hints that he thinks both sides have overstated the impact of the Alberta-to-Texas oil pipeline , which the State Department study indicates will be neither a major environmental problem nor a powerhouse job creator . But by letting the decision linger for years , Obama has also allowed pipeline opponents to elevate its political significance \u2014 adding it to the holy trinity of green litmus tests alongside drilling in Alaska \u2019 s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and saving the Pacific Northwest \u2019 s spotted owl .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t necessarily think that there \u2019 s a real climate change impact in this decision , \u201d said another former administration official who worked on energy issues . \u201c The oil is there . It \u2019 s going to be extracted . Its going to be sold to someone . By trying to frame this as a big political battle and a test of the president \u2019 s courage , I think it was a strategic miscalculation by the environmental community . \u201d\nPolitically , though , some who follow the issue say Keystone remains a tough call for the administration . It plays green activists and Democratic donors against each other headed into this year \u2019 s midterm elections . And several party activists offered contrasting arguments for whether a pro-Keystone or anti-Keystone decision works more to the Democrats \u2019 benefit .\nThe second former administration official said Obama would have reason to consider making a pro-Keystone decision now to take away a potent Republican talking point . Keystone has become \u201c a dog whistle for their [ GOP ] base , probably because the environmental community made it one , \u201d the ex-official said .\nBut Chris Lehane , a longtime party operative who worked for Al Gore \u2019 s 2000 campaign and is now affiliated with Steyer \u2019 s anti-Keystone super PAC , said Obama would risk dampening midterm turnout among two critical Democratic voting demographics \u2014 Hispanics and under-30s \u2014 by permitting the pipeline . \u201c If you \u2019 re talking about the raw politics of this , if you \u2019 re a Democrat and trying to maximize turnout , you have to look at which cohorts you \u2019 re trying to maximize , \u201d he said .\nLehane also recalled Obama \u2019 s recent comments to The New Yorker \u2019 s David Remnick about a president having a chance to influence only one paragraph in the history books . \u201c This would fall square in the type of paragraph the president was addressing in that conversation , \u201d Lehane said .\n\u201c Is it politically easier for him to approve this thing ? Maybe , \u201d said Roger Ballentine , a former environmental adviser to Kerry and President Bill Clinton . \u201c But I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s politically hard to reject it . \u201d\nHe argued that the need for a new pipeline to send Canadian oil to the Gulf Coast is unwarranted when U.S. oil production levels have topped exports for the first time since 1995 .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m a senator and someone tries to beat me up on this , I say , \u2018 Look , what we should be doing is focusing on the infrastructure we need to responsibly develop , \u2019 \u201d said Ballentine , now president of Green Strategies .\nObama is in a no-win situation as he weighs the appeals from greens , Republicans , industry and Canada , which is both a leading U.S. trading partner and \u201c one of our best friends in the world , \u201d said former State Department spokesman P.J . Crowley .\n\u201c The politics are complicated and to a large extent zero-sum , \u201d Crowley said . \u201c Which is why the administration is taking its time trying to manage a least-bad outcome . \u201d\nOn the pipeline \u2019 s merits , people on both sides said the final State Department report left Obama some room to either kill or reject the project .
