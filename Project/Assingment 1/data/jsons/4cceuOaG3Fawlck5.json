    "content": "Iran 's deal with the United States and other world powers is `` a step in the wrong direction in a very dangerous situation , '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's chief spokesman , Mark Regev , said Friday morning . `` The deal leaves Iran with an enormous and extensive nuclear infrastructure , '' Regev during an interview on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe '' program . `` It does n't close down , not even one uranium nuclear facility , not one . `` The deal will leave Iran with thousands of centrifuges , and will allow it to continue to enrich uranium , while working on research and development to make centrifuges that are even more efficient and quick , all of which are matters of concern , Regev said.But the even bigger area of concern is `` this is a regime that is exporting its version of the Islamic revolution to Iraq , to Syria , to Lebanon , and as you know very well , to Lebanon , to Yemen as well , '' said Regev . `` This is a regime that says my country should be destroyed . Now they want the nuclear power to implement that evil design . We ca n't allow it to happen . `` A nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to the United States as well , Regev said . `` Why is Iran building intercontinental ballistic missiles ? '' he said . `` They 're not building them to attack Israel . They can do that . They are building intercontinental ballistic missiles to hit \u2026 targets in the United States . They 're a threat to you , too . We ca n't in any way , I think , underestimate the danger of an Iranian regime , a regime committed to the export of the Islamic revolution with nuclear weapons . `` Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Friday that any nuclear agreement signed with Iran must endorse Israel 's right to exist , while also insisting pressure be kept up to ensure a sound deal is reached .\nWhile calling the emerging deal a bad one , he said the choice was not only between a bad deal or war .\n`` There is a third alternative - standing firm , increasing the pressure on Iran until a good deal is achieved , '' he said in a statement .\nAnd `` Israel demands that any final agreement with Iran will include a clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel 's right to exist . ''\nWhile Iranians celebrated in the streets over the deal , Netanyahu called a meeting on Friday with top ministers to discuss the deal agreed for Iran 's nuclear program , after voicing `` strong opposition '' to President Obama .\nNetanyahu told the president that a final deal based on the current agreement `` would threaten the survival of Israel , '' while legitimizing Iran 's nuclear program and increasing Iranian `` aggression and terror . ''\nHe also said `` it would not block Iran 's path to the bomb . It would pave it . ''\n`` It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war , '' he added .\nIran and world powers announced on Thursday that they had come to an initial agreement on the main tenets of the deal . It includes a timetable for lifting sanctions and shifting the function of Iranian nuclear facilities .\nThe details of the framework deal need to be finalized by June 30 . A final deal is expected to slash Iran 's bomb-capable technology while giving the country improved access to assets and markets blocked by international sanctions .\nHundreds of Iranians took to the streets in Tehran early Friday to celebrate a breakthrough in talks with the West that may end the country 's 12-year-long nuclear crisis .\nThe capital 's longest street , Val-e-Asr Avenue , was lined with cars as drivers sounded their horns in approval of a framework deal intended to lead to a comprehensive agreement with world powers in June .\n`` Whatever the final result of the negotiations , we are winners , '' 30-year-old Behrang Alavi said on Val-e-Asr at around 1:00 am as the noise reverberated around him .\nAppearing on MSNBC 's Morning Joe , Regev said that the monitoring of Iranian 's activities is `` highly problematic , '' not a benefit for Israel 's security interests .\n`` We have seen , and I think you would probably agree with this , we have seen over the years monitoring is highly problematic when you 're dealing with authoritarian , totalitarian regimes committed to concealment , '' he said . `` There 's a whole question what to inspect , where do you inspect , what do you know , what do you not know ? And to base your defense , the defense of my country , the defense of the region , and the defense of the United States on inspectors when their value is at least questionable , we think is very precarious . ''\nThe alternative to making a deal with Iran , Regev said , is to keep up pressure until a `` good deal '' is reached that `` does significantly roll back Iran 's nuclear infrastructure , a deal that insists on a change of Iranian behavior . ''\nSuch a deal would also call for Iran to stop its aggression in the region , said Regev .\n`` They must stop their aggression in the region , '' he said . `` They must stop their global support for terrorism , and they must stop calling for my country 's destruction . That 's a good deal . ''\nIran `` received an official kosher stamp for its illicit nuclear program , '' said Minister of Economy Naftali Bennett . The deal `` paves the way for Iran to eventually obtain a nuclear weapon , to further destabilize the Middle East and to continue spreading terror across the globe . Deal or no deal , Israel will do what is needed to protect itself and its citizens , '' he said .\nIsraeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said that all options were open .\n`` If we have no choice , we have no choice\u2026the military option is on the table . ''\nBut experts have warned that Netanyahu 's options are limited and military action is unlikely .\n`` After the entire world signed on an agreement with Iran , I do n't see Israel striking Iran nuclear facilities tomorrow morning , '' said Joel Guzansky , the former head of the Iran desk at Israel 's National Security Council .\n`` It will be seen as jeopardizing global security . However , if the Iranians were caught cheating , then it 's a different ball game , then you have the legitimacy to do other things . ''\nAnother expert , Yossi Kuperwasser , former director general of Israel 's strategic affairs ministry , suggested that Netanyahu would continue to keep up pressure until the final accord is agreed but that talk of military action will not necessarily result in action .\n`` As long as you have a credible military option , the Iranians will be very careful to not put you in a position where you will have to use it , '' he said .\nNetanyahu 's rhetoric has been less focused on military action as of late , according to Emily Landau , an expert on nuclear strategy and arms control at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv .\n`` There is definitely a change in the nuance , the rhetoric has changed , '' she said . `` We no longer hear these insinuated threats of a military attack [ on Iran 's nuclear facilities ] from Netanyahu , '' she said .\nRegev said it 's important for Israel to continue to state its case `` because this for us is a matter of the fundamental security of all our citizens [ and ] our country .
