    "content": "Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Ronald Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot . But that victory might never have ever happened without Nancy Reagan .\nThroughout Reagan \u2019 s first term , he was adamant about one thing . He did not want to just coexist with the USSR , as had all of his predecessors , but to defeat it . He said on many occasions that his plan for the Soviet Union was simple , \u201c We Win , They Lose \u201d . He called the Soviet Union an \u201c evil empire. \u201d Critics seized on those remarks to say , \u201c Ah-ha , Reagan is a war monger . He wants war with the Soviet Union . \u201d\nBut that was the furthest thing from his mind . Reagan wanted to us to win the Cold War , but not on the battlefield . He wanted to win it through economic pressure and diplomacy . But when he took office in January 1981 those goals were so ambitious they were laughable . So Reagan \u2019 s first term was devoted to fixing the U.S. economy , rebuilding our military , and restoring relations with our allies .\nOnce he had the United States in a position of strength , Reagan reversed gears , and pursued a policy of peace and arms reduction with the Soviet Union . Critics once again jumped on Reagan , how could he pursue peace with a nation he had just months before called an evil empire ?\nIt took enormous courage for Reagan to ignore those critics , and Mrs. Reagan was responsible -- more than anyone else -- for urging him forward . She not only worked behind the scenes with Reagan \u2019 s inner circle of advisers to urge the change of direction , but played a major diplomatic role in bringing the Soviet Union to the negotiating table .\nIn September 1984 , just two months before Reagan \u2019 s landslide reelection victory , the president took the first step . He invited Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to visit the White House for a small working luncheon . It was the first time a Soviet official was publicly received at the White House , and sent a signal that Reagan would have a different approach to the USSR in his second term .\nMrs. Reagan had been privately urging the president in this direction for some time , and worked behind the scenes with White House Chief of Staff James Baker , National Security Adviser Bud McFarlane and Secretary of State George Shultz to make it happen . They arranged for Mrs. Reagan to have her own , separate role in the landmark event .\nShe welcomed Gromyko to the White House at a reception prior to the lunch . When she greeted Gromyko , he leaned down to her and said , \u201c Does your husband believe in peace ? \u201d\nGromkyo responded , \u201c Then whisper \u2018 peace \u2019 in your husband \u2019 s ear every night . \u201d\nWithout missing a beat , Mrs. Reagan replied , \u201c I will . And I \u2019 ll also whisper it in your ear . \u201d\nGromyko repeated the story many times over the years .
