Vote Now\nPresident Barack Obama should stay off the campaign trail if Democrats are to hold on to their seats in the House in November , a new poll has found.According to a Fox News poll conducted July 20-22 of 1,057 registered voters , 57 percent said that if they were running for office as a Democrat this year they would not want Obama to campaign for them . Just 41 percent of voters would want Obama by their side on the campaign trail.In 2010 , the `` wave election '' when Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House , 48 percent of all voters said they would want the president to campaign for them if they were the Democratic candidate , compared to 50 percent who said they would have preferred he stay in the background.Among Democrats four years ago , a full 82 percent said they would want Obama to campaign on their behalf . Today , 69 percent of Democrats said they would want the president to help their campaign.Meanwhile , the survey also found that 43 percent of voters would support the Democratic candidate in their district , compared to 41 percent who would support the Republican.The results remain virtually unchanged since last month when the parties were tied at 42 percent . In early June , the GOP had a 4 percent advantage but in May , Democrats were ahead by 3 points . `` The Republicans have the upper hand at this point , although it 's a little weaker than in 2010 , '' said Republican pollster Daron Shaw , who jointly conducted the poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson . `` Their main problem is that there are far fewer vulnerable Democratic seats to pick off this time around . `` The survey 's results suggest it 's too soon to tell whether the 2014 midterm elections will be another wave election as numerous pundits have predicted , Fox said.The poll also indicated that Republicans have a significantly higher interest in the upcoming elections than Democrats . Specifically , 70 percent of Republicans say they are extremely or very interested in the election , compared to 56 percent of Democrats.And among those interested in the election , the results show that the GOP candidate would have a seven-point lead over the Democratic contender at 47 percent compared to 40 percent , a 3-point increase since last month.At the same point in the cycle in 2010 , the Republican candidate had an 11-point advantage over the Democratic candidate , a time when Obama 's job approval rating was slightly higher than today's.Fox noted that in the generic ballot before the 2010 midterms , Republican candidates also had a seven-point lead among registered voters.Meanwhile , the job approval for Congress has dipped to a dramatic low with just 13 percent of voters giving lawmakers a positive job approval rating compared to 79 percent who disapprove , the poll found .",
