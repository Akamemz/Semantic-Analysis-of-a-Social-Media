Thank you for giving us this time we have had with him , it was a blessing . ''\nOn June 11 , a frail Alvarez made his way to Washington with other first responders to testify in a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing for an extension of the fund for police officers , firefighters and other emergency workers who became ill after laboring at the site of the 2001 World Trade Center terrorist attacks . He received a standing ovation that day .\n`` I 'm now in hospice , because ( there ) is nothing else the doctors can do to fight the cancer , '' Alvarez wrote in a Facebook post the following week . `` Still here , still breathing , Still fighting .

''\nHe added , `` Now that the 9/11 illnesses have taken many of us , we are all worried about our children and spouses and our families if we are not here . ''\nLast week , Alvarez posted on Facebook that a nurse noticed he was disoriented when he went for chemo treatment .
