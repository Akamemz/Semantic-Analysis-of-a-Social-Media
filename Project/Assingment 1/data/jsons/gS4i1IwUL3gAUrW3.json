They have ramped up activity this summer , raising $ 16 million between July 1 and the end of September , and spending $ 5.4 million collecting data on donors , voters and grass-roots supporters .\nNot long ago , that level of campaign finance activity would have been expected during the campaign itself , but the breakneck pace before the 2014 midterms hints at just how expensive it will be to build a top-tier presidential campaign operation in 2016 .\nAnyone hoping to be competitive most likely will have to bring in between $ 100 million and $ 150 million next year before the first voters even go to the polls , said Michael Toner , a former FEC Commissioner who served as a top lawyer on the presidential campaigns of Republicans George W.
