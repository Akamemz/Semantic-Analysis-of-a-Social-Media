'' Since the early 20th century , agencies like the Federal Communications Commission have asked the public for comments before making big decisions . But in the past few months , the Commission received a deluge for one particular proceeding that could change the Internet as we know it .\nThe decision in question is on the fate of network neutrality - the idea that Internet Service Providers and the government should treat all data and traffic on the Internet the same .\ncitizens largely failed to sway the three Republican commissioners who wanted to relax ownership rules\nThe question is \u2014 will the FCC tally but otherwise ignore citizens ' concerns ? Or will it engage with the public and address those worries head on ?\nIf history is any indication , everyday citizens will likely continue to have weak influence at the agency . But understanding why citizens continue to have a weak influence points to a much larger tension between federal agencies and the public \u2014 and one that we must address if we want our agencies to help restore trust in government and strengthen their civic purpose .\nDuring the ten months of the proceeding , and in a pre-social media era of email campaigns , citizens submitted more than half a million comments . Public interest organizations , like Free Press and Prometheus Radio Project , mobilized citizens to contribute comments to the rulemaking record . Together with Democratic Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein , these groups organized nearly a dozen town hall meetings in which ordinary people could voice their concerns . Meanwhile , other groups like the National Rifle Association and MoveOn ( strange bedfellows if there ever were any ) galvanized their membership in separate letter-writing campaigns , generating a couple million postcards , letters , and emails to Commission staff opposing the rules .\nWhile public participation galvanized the public interest community and helped to turn Democrat Commissioners Adelstein and Copps into populist heroes , citizens largely failed to sway the three Republican commissioners who wanted to relax ownership rules . The Commission voted 3-2 to increase the number of television stations a single company could own , both locally and nationally ; revised regulations governing common ownership of radio stations in local markets ; and replaced two existing rules limiting common ownership ( e.g. , the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and the radio/television cross-ownership rule ) with a single set of cross-media limits . The changes marked a radical re-rendering of the broadcast media marketplace , and paved the way for media conglomerates to expand their gatekeeping role when deciding which news to feature and which advertisements to carry , locally and nationally .\n`` I find the whole rulemaking context almost hilarious in many instances , because you know you 're reading something , and you know it 's not true . And you 're guessing , you know , the person is hallucinating . ''\nThe public interest community derided the vote and called the process a sham . Then , the debate moved out of the agency and into the courts , and citizen input began to look even more ineffectual . A year following the FCC 's decision , an appellate court decision in the Third Circuit rejected parts of the Commission 's suite of deregulatory changes and also asked it to revise other parts of its decision . Though Prometheus , the lead complainant on the case , as well as other public interest organizations , credited public participation as a motivating factor , the court made no reference to the hundreds of thousands of citizen comments asking the Commission to preserve or strengthen ownership rules .\nFour years later , and still in the glow of the appellate decision , this community mobilized again for a new proceeding on media ownership rules . Again , citizens flooded the Commission with comments , held town halls , and campaigned against media consolidation . The FCC also hosted a series of six public hearings .\nYet , after more than 165,000 comments in the rulemaking record , and hundreds of hearing statements and testimonies , citizens once again had only a modest impact on the final decision .

But understanding why citizens continue to have a weak influence points to a much larger tension between federal agencies and the public \u2014 and one that we must address if we want our agencies to help restore trust in government and strengthen their civic purpose.\n\nIt's been more than a decade since the last major round of public participation in FCC rulemaking peaked but failed to win over the agency during a five-year debate over media ownership rules. (Note: rulemakings differ from complaints, like the hundreds of thousands of Janet Jackson/Superbowl complaints invoked incorrectly by commentators comparing them to participation in the Open Internet proceeding.) The rules, some of which had been in place since the 1940s, restricted how much a single company could own in local markets and the national market. The idea here was to reduce consolidation, and thus the control that big media magnates could wield over the airwaves and the American public. Then, in 2002, following a court decision that allowed more consolidation in the cable market, the Commission launched the most comprehensive review of ownership rules in the history of the agency to determine whether broadcast markets needed to keep apace with cable.\n\nDuring the ten months of the proceeding, and in a pre-social media era of email campaigns, citizens submitted more than half a million comments. Public interest organizations, like Free Press and Prometheus Radio Project, mobilized citizens to contribute comments to the rulemaking record. Together with Democratic Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, these groups organized nearly a dozen town hall meetings in which ordinary people could voice their concerns.
