    "content": "President Obama will unveil a comprehensive effort to address gun violence as he calls on Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of an aggressive agenda that is drawing resistance from some Republican lawmakers and gun rights advocates .\nThe president , facing criticism over his potential use of executive action to push multiple gun control measures , will be joined by children who wrote him letters about gun violence and school safety at a press conference shortly before noon on Wednesday .\n`` ( Obama ) believes and knows that most all gun owners are highly responsible , they buy their guns legally , and they use them safely , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday . `` He also has seen and believes that most gun owners support the idea of commonsense measures to prevent people who should n't have guns from getting them . ''\nCarney , without getting into specifics , vowed a `` comprehensive approach . '' Two Democratic aides later confirmed that the legislative plank would include a push for universal background checks , a ban on high-capacity magazines and renewal of the assault weapons ban .\nThe announcement -- the product of a task force led by Vice President Biden -- is cloaked in controversy . That the announcement would include children as a backdrop added another level .\nRoger Pilon , with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute , criticized the staging as `` tacky , '' saying Obama has `` carved up the population on a very emotional issue . ''\nYet in the wake of a school massacre last month in Connecticut that left 20 first-graders dead , as well as six educators , the president has stressed that children 's lives could be on the line . Obama , like prior presidents , often invites members of the public to act as a backdrop for certain policy announcements . They are always carefully selected -- over the summer , he invited college students for a speech about student loan rates and middle-class taxpayers to another talk on extending tax rates . The White House has also invited doctors for speeches on the health care overhaul .\nThe substance of Obama 's announcement Wednesday , though , is likely to cause the biggest stir .\nSources say he 's weighing as many as 19 possible actions he could take through executive order . Those options could include more aggressively enforcing existing gun laws , beefing up national research on guns and ordering stricter action against people who lie on gun sale background checks . They could include ordering tougher penalties for gun-trafficking offenses and ordering federal agencies to make data on gun crimes more readily available .\nCarney on Tuesday declined to specify what actions the president might take via executive order .\nThe president , though , has already voiced support for separate legislative measures in Congress , like the renewal of the assault weapons ban . That is expected to face the toughest opposition in Congress . But Biden , who led the gun violence task force and met with the president Monday , indicated the group is also pressing for limits on high-capacity magazines -- as well as background checks for anyone seeking to purchase a gun . Carney reiterated Tuesday that Obama still wants those measures pursued .\nSuch changes `` make sense , '' Obama said . He said lawmakers will have to `` examine their own conscience '' in the debate ahead .\nThe president 's push is drawing resistance from Republicans in Congress . Rep. Steve Stockman , R-Texas , is now vowing to try to impeach Obama if he takes any action via executive order .\nHe called the plan to implement some controls administratively `` an unconstitutional and unconscionable attack on the very founding principles of this republic . ''\n`` I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary , including , but not limited to , eliminating funding for implementation , defunding the White House , and even filing articles of impeachment , '' Stockman said .\nThe White House also has been at odds with the National Rifle Association , as it tries to keep focus on gun control measures in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre . The NRA , by contrast , has called for an increase in school security and a closer look at the entertainment and video game industries .\nDuring his press conference Monday , Obama accused critics of his approach of `` ginning up fear on the part of gun owners .
