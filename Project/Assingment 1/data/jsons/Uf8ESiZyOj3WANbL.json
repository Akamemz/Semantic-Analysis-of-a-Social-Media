    "content": "The Trump administration \u2019 s decision to begin taking migrant children from their parents at the border is an especially cruel policy . It can also be seen as part of a broader anti-immigrant backlash across the Western world , with countries as diverse as Britain , Italy , and Poland pushing for harsh new crackdowns on the rights of foreigners to enter .\nThe government whose policies most resemble President Trump \u2019 s is Hungary , where right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has made controlling migration the raison d \u2019 etre of his political career . Orb\u00e1n , who has been in power since 2010 , just won \u201c reelection \u201d on the strength of his pledge to fight what he describes as a foreign plot to infiltrate and destroy Hungary through mass migration .\nOne of the hallmarks of Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s response to the migrant crisis has been its sheer cruelty , to a degree that gives even Trump a run for his money . Hungary has built not one but two fences on its southern border with Serbia \u2014 with the express aim to cut off a common route refugees use to enter Europe . In one 2015 incident , when several asylum seekers tried to get through the fence , Hungarian riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at the crowd , which included children .\nAsylum seekers of all ages who actually make it across the border are detained in camps policed by armed guards and ringed with barbed wire . Human Rights Watch has documented instances of guards beating asylum seekers and then posing for selfies with their victims .\nThe goal of the Hungarian government \u2019 s cruelty , much like Trump \u2019 s , is to make migration as unpleasant as possible \u2014 to deter non-Hungarians , and particularly nonwhite and Muslim immigrants , from entering . Orb\u00e1n is quite clear about this in his speeches : Migrants from Africa and the Middle East pose an existential threat to Europe \u2019 s white Christian identity and must be kept out .\n\u201c Europe is now under invasion , \u201d Orb\u00e1n said in a March speech . \u201c Those who don \u2019 t block migration at their borders will be lost . Slowly but surely they are consumed . \u201d\nIn a series of tweets on Monday morning , Trump made arguments that were strikingly similar to Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s . He blasted European leaders for admitting \u201c millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture , \u201d arguing ( falsely ) that immigration had caused a spike in German crime rates . He cited this ( made-up ) crisis as explicit justification for his own harsh immigration crackdown :\nWe don \u2019 t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 18 , 2018\nThe specifics of the Trump and Orb\u00e1n policies \u2014 family separation versus barbed wire \u2014 are different . But the similarity of the justification , that notion that more immigration must be deterred at all costs , reveals something important about what Trump is currently doing . These harsh measures are an inevitable outgrowth of the way that Trump and other right-wing populists like Orb\u00e1n position migrants as a dire threat to the societies they \u2019 re trying to join .\nCruelty isn \u2019 t ancillary to the Trump approach to immigration . It \u2019 s at the heart of it .\nTrump and Orb\u00e1n are perhaps the two most important leaders in the global anti-immigration movement today . They eschew the kind of politeness heads of state are supposed to use when talking about immigrants , instead attacking them as people . Both men frequently describe immigrants as risks to the safety of their respective nations \u2014 and , sometimes , even their very survival .\nThe exact nature of the threat varies by context . Orb\u00e1n , dealing with large numbers of Muslim migrants , plays up fears of terrorism and the demise of \u201c Christian \u201d culture . \u201c Every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk , \u201d as he put it in a 2016 press conference .\nTrump used the same arguments about terrorism to justify his travel ban . But when dealing with largely Mexican and Central American migrants rather than Muslims , he plays up the threat of crime . The most famous example , of course , is the speech he gave at the opening of his campaign way back in 2015 :\nThe US has become a dumping ground for everybody else \u2019 s problems . ... When Mexico sends its people , they \u2019 re not sending their best . They \u2019 re not sending you . They \u2019 re not sending you . They \u2019 re sending people that have lots of problems , and they \u2019 re bringing those problems with us . They \u2019 re bringing drugs . They \u2019 re bringing crime . They \u2019 re rapists . And some , I assume , are good people .\nLike Orb\u00e1n , Trump has described the stakes here as being existential : that preventing mass migration , particularly undocumented migration , is a matter of life and death for the United States . \u201c If you don \u2019 t have Borders , you don \u2019 t have a Country ! \u201d he tweeted on Tuesday ( capitalization his ) .\nThe default assumption here isn \u2019 t that immigrants are normal people who might unintentionally harm native-born citizens by working for lower wages . It \u2019 s that the bulk of them are dangerous , distinct from native-born citizens in character and in kind .\nThe migrants at issue in the current American and Hungarian debates don \u2019 t resemble this caricature in the slightest . It \u2019 s actually somewhat the opposite : Many of these people are destitute and desperate , fleeing poverty , gang violence , or war .\nNow , intentionally inflicting horrors like family separation on people might seem impossibly cruel . But if you believe the stakes of the immigration fight are so high , that the very identity of the immigrants is so threatening that the country might not survive their influx , then extreme cruelty becomes not only justified but required .\nOrb\u00e1n has been explicit on this point , as has ( more or less ) Attorney General Jeff Sessions . In a Monday speech , he defended the Trump administration \u2019 s \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy as a \u201c terrible choice \u201d justified only by the \u201c lawlessness \u201d on America \u2019 s southern border . Were there fewer immigrants trying to enter , Sessions said , there wouldn \u2019 t be any need to break up families .\n\u201c We can not and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws , \u201d he said . \u201c If we build the wall , if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness , we won \u2019 t face these terrible choices . \u201d\nYou can find similar language \u2014 that migrants are a dire threat who must be met with extreme measures \u2014 in countries across Europe .
