    "content": "WASHINGTON - Testimony has concluded for the day and will resume on Thursday .\nFiona Hill , former White House aide who testified on national security adviser John Bolton \u2019 s concerns about Trump \u2019 s Ukraine policy\nDavid Holmes , State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who overheard Trump ask Sondland about \u201c investigations \u201d on a call\nAfter the hearing , Republicans cast aside the new information offered by Cooper , dismissing it as \u201c some email from some staffer . \u201d\nRep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , pointed out that the email Cooper said her staff got from an official at the Ukrainian embassy on July 25 \u2013 the same day that Trump has his infamous phone call with Ukraine \u2019 s president \u2013 did not include any mention of Ukrainians worried about a hold on military aid , only questioning the status of assistance .\nAsked about the specific timing of the email and that it was the same day as Trump spoke with Zelensky , Jordan said \u201c I find it interesting . At the same time , I do n't find it significant . \u201d\nHouse Intel Chairman Adam Schiff , D-California , ended Wednesday 's marathon hearings with a moment of levity after top Republican Devin Nunes mocked him in his closing remarks . Nunes concluded by saying he was handing over to Schiff for `` story-time hour . ''\n`` I thank the gentleman as always for his remarks , '' Schiff said before the audience broke out into laughter .\nBut the top Democrat used the remaining minutes to reflect on what he said is the difference between corruption and anti-corruption .\n\u201c We \u2019 re supposed to believe that Donald Trump is a great corruption fighter ... let \u2019 s look at his words and deeds , '' he said .\nRemoving former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and allegedly tying U.S. security assistance to Trump 's request for an investigation into the Bidens `` is not anti-corruption . That is corruption , '' he said .\nSchiff then closed out the hearing by recalling what he said was a telling moment in Kurt Volker 's testimony on Tuesday , in which the former special envoy to Ukraine recalled cautioning top Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak against investigating the country 's previous president .\n`` You mean the type of investigations you 're pushing for us to do on Biden and Clinton ? '' Yermak said , according to Volker .\nSchiff pointed out that 's not corruption or anti-corruption , but hypocrisy .\n`` When they see a president of the United States who is not devoted to the rule of law , who is not devoted to anti-corruption , but instead demonstrates in word and deed , corruption , they are forced to ask themselves , what does America stand for anymore ? ''\nDemocrats quash attempts to subpoena the whistleblower , other Republican witnesses\nFollowing the conclusion of Cooper and Hale \u2019 s testimony , Democrats on the Intelligence Committee declined to take up an attempt by Republicans to compel witnesses like the whistleblower and Hunter Biden to testify .\n\u201c I do not concur in these requests for subpoenas , \u201d Schiff said , adding that the committee would not attempt to investigate the whistleblower or debunked conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election .\nThe members voted to table the motions along party lines .\nRep. Denny Heck , D- Wash. , allowed Hale to have the floor and set the record straight on Yovanovitch , the former ambassador to the Ukraine who was ousted after a smear campaign .\nIn a lengthy statement , Heck outlined the smear campaign and said he was allowing Hale \u201c the opportunity to demonstrate leadership . \u201d\n\u201c Ambassador Hale , I want to give you an opportunity to now do what Secretary Pompeo did not do , \u201d Heck said . \u201c I \u2019 m offering you the opportunity to reaffirm to this committee and the millions of Americans hopefully who are watching , that Marie Yovanovitch is a dedicated and courageous patriot and that she served with grace and dig even in the face of that orchestrated and unsubstantiated smear attack against her . \u201d\nOver several minutes , Hale offered praise for Yovanovitch , saying he only met her when he took this job and knew \u201c immediately \u201d that she was an \u201c exceptional officer doing exceptional work \u201d in a critical area .\nHe said he supports the institutional officers working at the State Department and said they consist of the \u201c best groups of diplomats in the world. \u201d Hale noted he wished that Yovanovitch could have stayed in her post .\nRep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , went through particular arguments Republicans have lodged in defending the president , using holds on aid in other countries and that Ukraine did not know about a hold on money when the president made a request for investigations in his July 25 call with Zelensky .\nSwalwell outlined how a hold on military aid on Lebanon was different , something Hale said was legitimate due to concerns in the country .\nHe ended his questioning with noting how Cooper \u2019 s testimony about emails from Ukrainians that showed there was concern in July over military aid , including a July 25 email where a Ukrainian embassy official asked what was going on with military assistance . The emails raise questions over whether Ukrainians knew about a hold on $ 400 million in aid before a key phone call between Trump and Zelensky , which also happened on July 25 .\n\u201c Ms . Cooper . Your testimony today demonstrates the power of coming forward and defying lawless orders from the president , \u201d Swalwell said . \u201c Because you came forward and testified , we learned this new information , which destroys a central defense that the Republicans have put forward . \u201d\nCooper revises previous testimony , says Ukrainians worried about aid in July\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper gave information about additional relevant emails to lawmakers regarding Ukraine \u2019 s concerns about security assistance , an addition to her previous closed-door testimony .\nThe same day as the call between Trump and Zelensky , there were emails from the State Department saying both Congress and the Ukrainians were asking about security assistance .\n\u201c My staff showed me two unclassified emails that they received from the State Department . One was received on July 25th at 2:31 pm . That email said that the Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking about security assistance , \u201d Cooper said . \u201c The second one was received on July 25th at 4:25 pm . That email said that the Hill knows about the FMF [ Foreign Military Financing ] situation to an extent , and so does the Ukrainian Embassy . ''\nShe did not know , however , what specifically the Ukrainians asked about in their July messages , and she said she was not informed of the July 25 emails at the time .\nRepublicans have said the Ukrainians did not know about the hold on security assistance at the time of the call , which happened on the morning of July 25 .\nCooper did not discuss the hold on aid with President Donald Trump .\n`` I have never discussed this or any other matter with the President , and never heard directly from him about this matter , '' she said .\nSchiff opened the hearing by outlining what role Cooper and Hale have in this story\nDemocrats have outlined before Americans throughout the public hearings , with Cooper providing insight on the freeze on Ukraine military aid and Hale witnessing the smear campaign against former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch .\n\u201c Hale pushed to get the State Department to put out a robust full-page statement of defense and praise for Ambassador Yovanovitch , sadly to no avail , \u201d Schiff said . \u201c That silence continues today . \u201d\nNunes used his time at the start of the hearing to depict the inquiry as partisan and unfair , listing the witnesses who they would like to have testify before the committee .\n\u201c This is impeachment in search of a crime , \u201d Nunes said .\nCooper and Hale arrive for the second impeachment inquiry hearing\nDefense Department official Laura Cooper and State Department official David Hale arrived on Capitol Hill for the second hearing today in House Democrats \u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump .\nCooper , who oversees Ukraine policy at the Pentagon , previously testified behind closed doors about the withholding of security assistance to Ukraine .\nHale , a senior State Department official , told lawmakers and staff behind closed doors about the ouster of U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch .\nThe evening hearing is likely to be shorter than this morning \u2019 s lengthy hearing with U.S . Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland .\nSchiff : Sondland testimony is a 'seminal moment in our investigation '\nRep. Devin Nunes of California , the top Republican on the committee , said Democrats continued to change what they sought in their investigation . The hearing failed to answer fundamental questions such as who was the whistleblower , Nunes said .\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , said Sondland provided crucial information .\n\u201c This is a seminal moment in our investigation , \u201d Schiff said . \u201c The evidence you have brought forward is deeply significant and troubling . \u201d\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney , D-N.Y. , walked Sondland through a series of questions about his July 26 call with Trump about Ukraine investigations , with the ultimate question about who would benefit from the investigation of the president \u2019 s political opponents .\nSondland said he preferred not to characterize who would benefit . Sondland also parried by saying he didn \u2019 t realize at the time that investigations of Burisma Holdings meant an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son , Hunter . Ultimately , he surrendered .\n\u201c I assume President Trump , \u201d Sondland said , to applause in the audience . After a pause , Sondland added : \u201c I \u2019 ve been very forthright . I really resent what you \u2019 re trying to do . \u201d\nMaloney thanked him for being forthright , but said it took three tries to get there . Sondland gave a closed-door deposition and then modified it before the transcript was released , before his testimony Wednesday .\n\u201c We appreciate your candor , \u201d Maloney said . \u201c But let \u2019 s be really clear about what it took to get it out of you . \u201d\nSondland said he had talked with the president many times in response to a question from Rep. Jackie Speier about the number of times he had talked with the president .\n\u201c It 's probably in that range , '' he told Speier when she asked if the number of conversations he had with the president was `` less than 20 . ''\nEarlier today , Trump said he did not know Sondland well .\n`` I don \u2019 t know him very well . I have not spoken to him much , '' Trump told reporters .\nAccording to Sondland , he and Trump \u201c are not close friends \u201d but \u201c have a professional , cordial working relationship . \u201d\nWhen asked if Trump knew who Sondland was , he said , \u201c Yes . \u201d\nRep. Jackie Speier , D-Calif. , asked about retaliation against a whistleblower who files a complaint , when she was interrupted by Rep. Michael Conaway , R-Texas , asking if she would respond to a question .\nShe refused to yield because she had only three minutes for questions . Conaway said the article based on her allegation got three Pinocchios , a measure of accuracy used by The Washington Post .\n\u201c The president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis , so let \u2019 s not go there , \u201d Speier said to sustained applause in the audience .\nSondland said he , Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker worked with `` Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States . ''\n`` We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani , `` he said . `` Simply put , we played the hand we were dealt . We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani , we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine . So we followed the President \u2019 s orders . ''\n`` We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the President directed us to do so , '' he said again .\nThe testimony from Sondland , a wealthy Portland , Oregon , hotelier and Trump donor , is being closely watched because of his ability to offer a first hand account of his discussions with Trump on Ukraine .\nSondland described raising worries about a `` quid pro quo '' with Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wisc. , a close Trump ally who served on a congressional task force on Ukraine .\n`` I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson , '' Sondland said , adding that he also raised concerns with Ukrainian officials .\nSondland said he became aware in July and August that the White House suspended security aid , a move he opposed . He said he wasn \u2019 t told why the aid was held up , but that he understood it \u2019 s release would depend on Ukraine beginning investigations .\n\u201c I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid , as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression , \u201d Sondland said . \u201c I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended , but I never received a clear answer . In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid , I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma , as Mr. Giuliani had demanded . \u201d\nTrump has attempted to put distance between himself and Sondland , telling reporters on Nov. 8 , `` I hardly know the gentleman . ''\n-- Bart Jansen , William Cummings , Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu\nSondland 's opening statement : Read the full text of his opening statement in the impeachment hearing\nWitness testimonies : Who are the 17 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said ?\nPresident Donald Trump zeroed in Wednesday on one portion of the bombshell impeachment testimony on Capitol Hill : Gordon Sondland 's testimony that the president did not directly tie Ukraine aid to investigations into his rival .\nReading from hand-written notes on the South Lawn of the White House as he departed for Texas , Trump focused on the portion of Sondland \u2019 s testimony in which he says the president told him there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine .\n`` That means it \u2019 s all over , '' Trump told reporters . `` This is the final word from the president of the United States . I want nothing . ''\nTrump then walked off to Marine One without taking questions . He ignored other , more damaging testimony , such as Sondland 's understanding that a large number of officials understood that Ukraine would not receive nearly $ 400 million in military aid until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his government would cooperate with the investigations .\nRep. John Ratcliffe , R-Texas , reinforced that Trump said , \u201c I want nothing \u201d and \u201c no quid pro quo , \u201d in a Sept. 9 call with Sondland .\n\u201c Anything sinister or nefarious about any of that ? \u201d Ratcliffe asked , which Sondland denied . \u201c That is the truth , as you have presented it , correct . None of that is hearsay . None of that is speculation . That is direct evidence . \u201d\nThe president 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani defended himself against Sondland 's allegations , in which the U.S. ambassador to the E.U . said Trump directed Giuliani to push for a quid pro quo in Ukraine on his behalf .\n`` I came into this at Volker \u2019 s request . Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact . I never met him and had very few calls with him , mostly with Volker , '' Giuliani tweeted , referring to Kurt Volker , a former envoy to Ukraine who testified on Tuesday .\n`` Volker testified I answered their questions and described them as my opinions , NOT demands . I.E. , no quid pro quo ! '' Giuliani said .\nVolker testified that he never considered Giuliani to be speaking on behalf of the president .\nDuring his closed-door deposition , Sondland testified that he did not recall meeting Giuliani in person during his time as ambassador . He said he `` only spoke with him a few times '' and Volker had introduced him electronically . He said he believes he spoke to Giuliani no more than two or three times by phone , with the first time in early August of 2019 .\nUnder Republican questioning , Sondland said Trump never ordered him to work with Giuliani , but that if he and other U.S. officials such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Volker wanted to improve the relationship with Ukraine , Giuliani was key .\n\u201c Rudy was the guy , \u201d Sondland said . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t an order . It was if you want to work on this , this is the guy you got ta talk to . \u201d\nIn a tweet , Giulani accused House Republican lawyer Steve Castor of \u201c picking up Democrat lies \u201d by asking Sondland why he trusted Giuliani \u201c given his business dealings in the region . \u201d\n\u201c I have NO financial interests in Ukraine , NONE ! I would appreciate his apology , \u201d Giuliani wrote .\nRep. Michael Turner , R-Ohio , said Sondland testified that Trump never told him that military aid depended on an announcement of investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election .\nSondland said it was his presumption that aid was tied to the investigations .\n\u201c No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to the investigations . Yes or no ? \u201d Turner said .\n\u201c You really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations , \u201d Turner said .\nSondland said he was presuming . Turner said the evidence wasn \u2019 t even hearsay , it was made up .\n\u201c Made up testimony is when I just presume it , \u201d Turner said . \u201c You \u2019 re just assuming all of these things . \u201d\nRep. Lee Zeldin , R-N.Y. , said Sondland \u2019 s credibility was an issue because he said he presumed that the administration was withholding military aid from Ukraine on condition of investigations , rather than being told that directly by President Donald Trump .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a problem , when you \u2019 re using words like speculation , presumption , guessing , \u201d Zeldin said . \u201c You have additional information that I think would be helpful for these questions and answers . \u201d\nRepublicans have noted that Mark Sandy , an official from the Office of Management and Budget , gave a closed-door deposition on Saturday to three committees investigating Ukraine , but that the transcript hasn \u2019 t been released yet . Zeldin said Sandy explained why the aid was withheld .\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , said Sandy was reviewing his transcript Wednesday before it is released . Sandy is not a top official at the Office of Management and Budget responsible for the release of foreign aid , Schiff said . The acting OMB director and deputy director each defied subpoenas for their testimony .\nRick Perry \u2019 s office says Sondland misrepresented his contacts with Giuliani .\nThe office of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Sondland \u201c misrepresented both Secretary Perry 's interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump . \u201d\nAccording to Perry \u2019 s office , Perry only spoke to Giuliani once , at Trump \u2019 s request .\n\u201c At no point before , during or after that phone call did the words 'Biden ' or 'Burisma ' ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry , \u201d said DOE press secretary Shaylyn Hynes .\nSondland disputes reports he was part of irregular diplomacy channel\nSondland disputed the description by other diplomats that he and others were running an irregular channel of diplomacy with Ukraine because he was dealing directly with President Donald Trump , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former National Security Adviser John Bolton .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure how someone can characterize something as an irregular channel when you \u2019 re counting the president of the United States , the secretary of State , the national security adviser , the chief of staff at the White House , secretary of Energy , \u201d Sondland said . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how that \u2019 s irregular . A bunch of folks that are not in that channel are aggrieved for some reason for not being included . I don \u2019 t know how they can consider us being the irregular channel , and they being the regular channel , when it \u2019 s the leadership making the decisions . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t remember anyone sounding any alarm , \u201d Sondland said . \u201c Everyone \u2019 s hair was on fire , but nobody decided to talk to us . \u201d\nSondland said he was surprised to hear other U.S. officials were upset about a July 10 meeting at the White House where he discussed investigations with Ukraine officials as a condition of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky .\nOther witnesses , including Fiona Hill , a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia , have testified that former National Security Adviser John Bolton abruptly ended the meeting when investigations were mentioned . Hill said Bolton told her to report the incident to council lawyers and that he wasn \u2019 t part of whatever \u201c drug deal \u201d that Sondland and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were `` cooking up . ''\nUnder Republican questioning , Sondland said he was surprised to hear the complaints because he thought the meeting ended well , with pictures on the White House lawn on a sunny day .\nRep. Devin Nunes of California , the top Republican on the committee , highlighted Trump \u2019 s reason for skepticism about Ukraine \u2019 s anti-corruption efforts in requesting investigations . Nunes said Democratic operatives tried to discredit the 2016 Trump campaign with Ukrainian sources .\n\u201c Who were these Democratic operatives who were dirtying up the Trump campaign in 2016 ? \u201d Nunes asked .\nSondland confirmed that he had told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition that Trump was skeptical about Ukraine during a May 23 meeting at the White House .\n\u201c I think he said : 'they tried to take me down . ' He kept saying that over and over , \u201d Sondland said in the deposition .\nDuring a break in the hearing , House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Gordon Sondland \u2019 s testimony \u201c goes right to the heart \u201d of the investigation on Ukraine that House Democrats are pursuing .\nSchiff said the ambassador 's testimony was \u201c among the most significant evidence to date . \u201d\nGordon Sondland said Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were kept informed of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to open investigations into Trump \u2019 s political rivals .\n\u201c I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations , \u201d Sondland said Sept. 1 before a meeting between Pence and Zelensky .\nSondland submitted to lawmakers emails he had written to Pompeo and other Trump administration officials .\nA July 19 email from Sondland to Pompeo , White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney , Energy Secretary Rick Perry , and other officials carried the subject line \u201c Re : I Talked to Zelensky just now. \u201d It said Zelensky was prepared to receive a call from Trump\n\u201c He is prepared to receive Potus ' call . Will assure him [ Trump ] that he [ Zelensky ] intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018 turn over every stone , \u2019 \u201d Sondland wrote .\nSondland on Pence and Pompeo : 'Everyone was in the loop , ' ambassador says about high-level efforts to pressure Ukraine\nOn Aug. 11 , Sondland sent an email to State Department officials and addressed to Pompeo .\n\u201c Mike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Ze [ lensky ] to be delivered for our review in a day or two , \u201d Sondland wrote \u201c The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation . Ze plans to have a big presser on the openness subject ( including specifics ) next week . \u201d\nSondland said a top State Department official , Lisa Kenna , responded that she would pass the note to Pompeo .\nMarc Short , Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s chief of staff , disputed Sondland \u2019 s testimony about speaking with Pence in Warsaw on Sept. 1 about investigations , saying it never happened .\n\u201c The Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens , Burisma , or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations , \u201d Short said . \u201c Ambassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland . This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened . \u201d\nShort also noted that multiple witnesses had said Pence never mentioned Hunter Biden , former Vice President Joe Biden or Burisma before or after the Sept. 1 meeting .\nGordon Sondland confirmed he spoke with Trump on his cell phone on July 26 , a day after the president had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\nDavid Holmes , a State Department official at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv , told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition last week that he overheard Sondland 's July 26 call with Trump and said the president asked whether Zelensky was going to open the investigation he sought .\nSondland said he was at a Kyiv restaurant , as Holmes also said , and the call lasted five minutes .\n`` Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call . For the most part , I have no reason to doubt their accounts . It is true that the President speaks loudly at times , '' he said Wednesday .\n`` It is true that the President likes to use colorful language , '' he added , referring to the expletives mentioned in Holmes ' recall of the conversation .\nSondland added though he did not remember the precise details of the conversation , noting the White House prohibited him from seeing any readouts of the call . He said that at the time , he did not think the conversation was significant .\n`` Actually , I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations , particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president 's concerns , '' he said .\nBut he said he had no recollection of discussing Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter on the call or after it ended . Holmes told House investigators Sondland told him after the call that Trump only cared about `` big things '' that benefited him , like `` this Biden investigation that Giuliani is pushing . ''\nAsked by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff if he had anything to dispute in Holmes ' recollection of the call , Sondland said he did n't , though he did not recall mentioning Biden .\n\u201c I do not recall mentioning the Bidens . It was Burisma and the 2016 election , '' he said .\nAsked about the July 26 call with Sondland , Trump said : `` I know nothing about that . First time I 've heard it . The one thing I 've seen that Sondland said was that he did speak to me with for a brief moment and I said 'no quid pro quo under any circumstances . ' ''\n`` And that 's true . But I 've never heard this . In any event , it is more secondhand information , but I 've never heard it , '' Trump told reporters last week .\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Sondland \u2019 s testimony , highlighting how Trump told the ambassador there was \u201c no quid pro quo . \u201d\n\u201c No quid pro quo ever occurred , \u201d she said , denying the conditioning of security assistance on the opening of investigations .\nIn response to a question from Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , Gordon Sondland said Rudy Giuliani had conveyed to him that what mattered most to Donald Trump was the public announcement of the investigations , not the investigations themselves .\n\u201c He had to announce the investigations . He did n't actually have to do them , '' Sondland said of the president \u2019 s demands as expressed through Giuliani .\nRep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee , compared the Ukraine outreach to George Washington \u2019 s diplomacy with Great Britain in his opening statement .\n\u201c I would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president , George Washington , directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with Great Britain . If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794 , they \u2019 d probably want to impeach him , too , \u201d Nunes said .\nHe also lashed out at \u201c partisan extremists \u201d who transformed the Intelligence Committee into an \u201c Impeachment Committee . \u201d\n\u201c The Democrats have exploited the Intelligence Committee for political purposes for three years , culminating in these impeachment hearings , \u201d he said .\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-California , began his opening remarks by laying out the Democratic case of impeachment against President Donald Trump .\n`` Trump \u2019 s scheme undermined military and diplomatic support for a key ally and undercut U.S. anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine , '' he said .\nSchiff recounted Sondland 's role in the Ukrainian saga , placing him in key moments in the timeline and underscoring his importance as a witness to whether Trump abused his power . The top Democrat described Sondland as a `` skilled dealmaker '' who `` found himself increasingly embroiled in an effort to press the new Ukrainian President that deviated sharply from the norm , in terms of both policy and process . ''\n`` Now , it is up to Congress , as the people \u2019 s representatives to determine what response is appropriate , '' he said after recalling the events in Ukraine .\n`` If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections , if he sought to condition , coerce , extort , or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2013 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2013 it will be up to us to decide , whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency , '' Schiff said .\nIn an addendum to his original testimony , Sondland said he communicated a quid pro quo to a top Ukrainian presidential adviser , Andriy Yermak .\n`` I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak , where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks , '' Sondland said .\nDavid Holmes , a State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv , testified that he overheard a call between Sondland and Trump in which Trump asked Sondland about `` investigations . ''\nAccording to Holmes , Sondland assured Trump that Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201c loves your a -- \u201d and would do \u201c anything you ask him to \u201d about investigations .\nHolmes said , `` I then heard President Trump ask , 'So , he 's gon na do the investigation ? ' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he 's gon na do it , ' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to .

    "content_original": "USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON - Testimony has concluded for the day and will resume on Thursday.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTwo other witnesses will testify this week:\n\nFiona Hill, former White House aide who testified on national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy\n\nDavid Holmes, State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who overheard Trump ask Sondland about \u201cinvestigations\u201d on a call\n\nAfter the hearing, Republicans cast aside the new information offered by Cooper, dismissing it as \u201csome email from some staffer.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed out that the email Cooper said her staff got from an official at the Ukrainian embassy on July 25 \u2013 the same day that Trump has his infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u2013 did not include any mention of Ukrainians worried about a hold on military aid, only questioning the status of assistance.\n\nAsked about the specific timing of the email and that it was the same day as Trump spoke with Zelensky, Jordan said \u201cI find it interesting. At the same time, I don't find it significant.\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Christal Hayes\n\nSchiff closes out marathon hearings\n\nHouse Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, ended Wednesday's marathon hearings with a moment of levity after top Republican Devin Nunes mocked him in his closing remarks. Nunes concluded by saying he was handing over to Schiff for \"story-time hour.\"\n\n\"I thank the gentleman as always for his remarks,\" Schiff said before the audience broke out into laughter.\n\nBut the top Democrat used the remaining minutes to reflect on what he said is the difference between corruption and anti-corruption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to believe that Donald Trump is a great corruption fighter...let\u2019s look at his words and deeds,\" he said.\n\nRemoving former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and allegedly tying U.S. security assistance to Trump's request for an investigation into the Bidens \"is not anti-corruption. That is corruption,\" he said.\n\nSchiff then closed out the hearing by recalling what he said was a telling moment in Kurt Volker's testimony on Tuesday, in which the former special envoy to Ukraine recalled cautioning top Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak against investigating the country's previous president.\n\n\"You mean the type of investigations you're pushing for us to do on Biden and Clinton?\" Yermak said, according to Volker.\n\nSchiff pointed out that's not corruption or anti-corruption, but hypocrisy.\n\n\"When they see a president of the United States who is not devoted to the rule of law, who is not devoted to anti-corruption, but instead demonstrates in word and deed, corruption, they are forced to ask themselves, what does America stand for anymore?\"\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nDemocrats quash attempts to subpoena the whistleblower, other Republican witnesses\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Cooper and Hale\u2019s testimony, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee declined to take up an attempt by Republicans to compel witnesses like the whistleblower and Hunter Biden to testify.\n\n\u201cI do not concur in these requests for subpoenas,\u201d Schiff said, adding that the committee would not attempt to investigate the whistleblower or debunked conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe members voted to table the motions along party lines.\n\nHale: Yovanovitch was an 'exceptional officer doing exceptional work'\n\nRep. Denny Heck, D- Wash., allowed Hale to have the floor and set the record straight on Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to the Ukraine who was ousted after a smear campaign.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Heck outlined the smear campaign and said he was allowing Hale \u201cthe opportunity to demonstrate leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbassador Hale, I want to give you an opportunity to now do what Secretary Pompeo did not do,\u201d Heck said. \u201cI\u2019m offering you the opportunity to reaffirm to this committee and the millions of Americans hopefully who are watching, that Marie Yovanovitch is a dedicated and courageous patriot and that she served with grace and dig even in the face of that orchestrated and unsubstantiated smear attack against her.\u201d\n\nOver several minutes, Hale offered praise for Yovanovitch, saying he only met her when he took this job and knew \u201cimmediately\u201d that she was an \u201cexceptional officer doing exceptional work\u201d in a critical area.\n\nHe said he supports the institutional officers working at the State Department and said they consist of the \u201cbest groups of diplomats in the world.\u201d Hale noted he wished that Yovanovitch could have stayed in her post.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nCooper testimony \u2018destroys\u2019 central GOP defense, Swalwell says\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., went through particular arguments Republicans have lodged in defending the president, using holds on aid in other countries and that Ukraine did not know about a hold on money when the president made a request for investigations in his July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nSwalwell outlined how a hold on military aid on Lebanon was different, something Hale said was legitimate due to concerns in the country.\n\nHe ended his questioning with noting how Cooper\u2019s testimony about emails from Ukrainians that showed there was concern in July over military aid, including a July 25 email where a Ukrainian embassy official asked what was going on with military assistance. The emails raise questions over whether Ukrainians knew about a hold on $400 million in aid before a key phone call between Trump and Zelensky, which also happened on July 25.\n\n\u201cMs. Cooper. Your testimony today demonstrates the power of coming forward and defying lawless orders from the president,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cBecause you came forward and testified, we learned this new information, which destroys a central defense that the Republicans have put forward.\u201d\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nCooper revises previous testimony, says Ukrainians worried about aid in July\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper gave information about additional relevant emails to lawmakers regarding Ukraine\u2019s concerns about security assistance, an addition to her previous closed-door testimony.\n\nThe same day as the call between Trump and Zelensky, there were emails from the State Department saying both Congress and the Ukrainians were asking about security assistance.\n\n\u201cMy staff showed me two unclassified emails that they received from the State Department. One was received on July 25th at 2:31 pm. That email said that the Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking about security assistance,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe second one was received on July 25th at 4:25 pm. That email said that the Hill knows about the FMF [Foreign Military Financing] situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian Embassy.\"\n\nShe did not know, however, what specifically the Ukrainians asked about in their July messages, and she said she was not informed of the July 25 emails at the time.\n\nRepublicans have said the Ukrainians did not know about the hold on security assistance at the time of the call, which happened on the morning of July 25.\n\nCooper did not discuss the hold on aid with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I have never discussed this or any other matter with the President, and never heard directly from him about this matter,\" she said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff opened the hearing by outlining what role Cooper and Hale have in this story\n\nDemocrats have outlined before Americans throughout the public hearings, with Cooper providing insight on the freeze on Ukraine military aid and Hale witnessing the smear campaign against former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cHale pushed to get the State Department to put out a robust full-page statement of defense and praise for Ambassador Yovanovitch, sadly to no avail,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat silence continues today.\u201d\n\nNunes used his time at the start of the hearing to depict the inquiry as partisan and unfair, listing the witnesses who they would like to have testify before the committee.\n\n\u201cThis is impeachment in search of a crime,\u201d Nunes said.\n\nCooper and Hale arrive for the second impeachment inquiry hearing\n\nDefense Department official Laura Cooper and State Department official David Hale arrived on Capitol Hill for the second hearing today in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nCooper, who oversees Ukraine policy at the Pentagon, previously testified behind closed doors about the withholding of security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nHale, a senior State Department official, told lawmakers and staff behind closed doors about the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe evening hearing is likely to be shorter than this morning\u2019s lengthy hearing with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff: Sondland testimony is a 'seminal moment in our investigation'\n\nRep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, said Democrats continued to change what they sought in their investigation. The hearing failed to answer fundamental questions such as who was the whistleblower, Nunes said.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sondland provided crucial information.\n\n\u201cThis is a seminal moment in our investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe evidence you have brought forward is deeply significant and troubling.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nStay updated:Follow USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\n\nSondland: Trump would benefit from the opening of investigations\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., walked Sondland through a series of questions about his July 26 call with Trump about Ukraine investigations, with the ultimate question about who would benefit from the investigation of the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\nSondland said he preferred not to characterize who would benefit. Sondland also parried by saying he didn\u2019t realize at the time that investigations of Burisma Holdings meant an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Ultimately, he surrendered.\n\n\u201cI assume President Trump,\u201d Sondland said, to applause in the audience. After a pause, Sondland added: \u201cI\u2019ve been very forthright. I really resent what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nMaloney thanked him for being forthright, but said it took three tries to get there. Sondland gave a closed-door deposition and then modified it before the transcript was released, before his testimony Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your candor,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be really clear about what it took to get it out of you.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSondland says he\u2019s talked with the president many times\n\nSondland said he had talked with the president many times in response to a question from Rep. Jackie Speier about the number of times he had talked with the president.\n\n\u201cIt's probably in that range,\" he told Speier when she asked if the number of conversations he had with the president was \"less than 20.\"\n\nEarlier today, Trump said he did not know Sondland well.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nAccording to Sondland, he and Trump \u201care not close friends\u201d but \u201chave a professional, cordial working relationship.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Trump knew who Sondland was, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nRep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., asked about retaliation against a whistleblower who files a complaint, when she was interrupted by Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, asking if she would respond to a question.\n\nShe refused to yield because she had only three minutes for questions. Conaway said the article based on her allegation got three Pinocchios, a measure of accuracy used by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let\u2019s not go there,\u201d Speier said to sustained applause in the audience.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSondland: We worked with Giuliani at Trump's behest\n\nSondland said he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker worked with \"Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani, \" he said. \"Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the President\u2019s orders.\"\n\n\"We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the President directed us to do so,\" he said again.\n\nThe testimony from Sondland, a wealthy Portland, Oregon, hotelier and Trump donor, is being closely watched because of his ability to offer a first hand account of his discussions with Trump on Ukraine.\n\nSondland described raising worries about a \"quid pro quo\" with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., a close Trump ally who served on a congressional task force on Ukraine.\n\n\"I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson,\" Sondland said, adding that he also raised concerns with Ukrainian officials.\n\nSondland said he became aware in July and August that the White House suspended security aid, a move he opposed. He said he wasn\u2019t told why the aid was held up, but that he understood it\u2019s release would depend on Ukraine beginning investigations.\n\n\u201cI was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid, as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cI tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.\u201d\n\nTrump has attempted to put distance between himself and Sondland, telling reporters on Nov. 8, \"I hardly know the gentleman.\"\n\n-- Bart Jansen, William Cummings, Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu\n\nSondland's opening statement:Read the full text of his opening statement in the impeachment hearing\n\nWitness testimonies:Who are the 17 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said?\n\nTrump on Sondland testimony: 'It's all over'\n\nPresident Donald Trump zeroed in Wednesday on one portion of the bombshell impeachment testimony on Capitol Hill: Gordon Sondland's testimony that the president did not directly tie Ukraine aid to investigations into his rival.\n\nReading from hand-written notes on the South Lawn of the White House as he departed for Texas, Trump focused on the portion of Sondland\u2019s testimony in which he says the president told him there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"That means it\u2019s all over,\" Trump told reporters. \"This is the final word from the president of the United States. I want nothing.\"\n\nTrump then walked off to Marine One without taking questions. He ignored other, more damaging testimony, such as Sondland's understanding that a large number of officials understood that Ukraine would not receive nearly $400 million in military aid until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his government would cooperate with the investigations.\n\nRep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, reinforced that Trump said, \u201cI want nothing\u201d and \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d in a Sept. 9 call with Sondland.\n\n\u201cAnything sinister or nefarious about any of that?\u201d Ratcliffe asked, which Sondland denied. \u201cThat is the truth, as you have presented it, correct. None of that is hearsay. None of that is speculation. That is direct evidence.\u201d\n\n- John Fritze\n\nGiuliani defends himself amid Sondland testimony\n\nThe president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani defended himself against Sondland's allegations, in which the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. said Trump directed Giuliani to push for a quid pro quo in Ukraine on his behalf.\n\n\"I came into this at Volker\u2019s request. Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact. I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker,\" Giuliani tweeted, referring to Kurt Volker, a former envoy to Ukraine who testified on Tuesday.\n\n\"Volker testified I answered their questions and described them as my opinions, NOT demands. I.E., no quid pro quo!\" Giuliani said.\n\nVolker testified that he never considered Giuliani to be speaking on behalf of the president.\n\nDuring his closed-door deposition, Sondland testified that he did not recall meeting Giuliani in person during his time as ambassador. He said he \"only spoke with him a few times\" and Volker had introduced him electronically. He said he believes he spoke to Giuliani no more than two or three times by phone, with the first time in early August of 2019.\n\nUnder Republican questioning, Sondland said Trump never ordered him to work with Giuliani, but that if he and other U.S. officials such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Volker wanted to improve the relationship with Ukraine, Giuliani was key.\n\n\u201cRudy was the guy,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an order. It was if you want to work on this, this is the guy you gotta talk to.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Giulani accused House Republican lawyer Steve Castor of \u201cpicking up Democrat lies\u201d by asking Sondland why he trusted Giuliani \u201cgiven his business dealings in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have NO financial interests in Ukraine, NONE! I would appreciate his apology,\u201d Giuliani wrote.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian and Bart Jansen\n\nTurner criticizes Sondland's presumption on Ukraine aid\n\nRep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said Sondland testified that Trump never told him that military aid depended on an announcement of investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.\n\nSondland said it was his presumption that aid was tied to the investigations.\n\n\u201cNo one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to the investigations. Yes or no?\u201d Turner said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n\u201cYou really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations,\u201d Turner said.\n\nSondland said he was presuming. Turner said the evidence wasn\u2019t even hearsay, it was made up.\n\n\u201cMade up testimony is when I just presume it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cYou\u2019re just assuming all of these things.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nGOP lawmaker challenges Sondland's credibility\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said Sondland\u2019s credibility was an issue because he said he presumed that the administration was withholding military aid from Ukraine on condition of investigations, rather than being told that directly by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem, when you\u2019re using words like speculation, presumption, guessing,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cYou have additional information that I think would be helpful for these questions and answers.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have noted that Mark Sandy, an official from the Office of Management and Budget, gave a closed-door deposition on Saturday to three committees investigating Ukraine, but that the transcript hasn\u2019t been released yet. Zeldin said Sandy explained why the aid was withheld.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sandy was reviewing his transcript Wednesday before it is released. Sandy is not a top official at the Office of Management and Budget responsible for the release of foreign aid, Schiff said. The acting OMB director and deputy director each defied subpoenas for their testimony.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRick Perry hits back on Sondland testimony\n\nRick Perry\u2019s office says Sondland misrepresented his contacts with Giuliani.\n\nThe office of Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Sondland \u201cmisrepresented both Secretary Perry's interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump.\u201d\n\nAccording to Perry\u2019s office, Perry only spoke to Giuliani once, at Trump\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cAt no point before, during or after that phone call did the words 'Biden' or 'Burisma' ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry,\u201d said DOE press secretary Shaylyn Hynes.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSondland disputes reports he was part of irregular diplomacy channel\n\nSondland disputed the description by other diplomats that he and others were running an irregular channel of diplomacy with Ukraine because he was dealing directly with President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how someone can characterize something as an irregular channel when you\u2019re counting the president of the United States, the secretary of State, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, secretary of Energy,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s irregular. A bunch of folks that are not in that channel are aggrieved for some reason for not being included. I don\u2019t know how they can consider us being the irregular channel, and they being the regular channel, when it\u2019s the leadership making the decisions.\u201d\n\nThe others never complained to him, Sondland said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone sounding any alarm,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s hair was on fire, but nobody decided to talk to us.\u201d\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSondland: \u2018Shocked\u2019 by response to meeting\n\nSondland said he was surprised to hear other U.S. officials were upset about a July 10 meeting at the White House where he discussed investigations with Ukraine officials as a condition of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOther witnesses, including Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, have testified that former National Security Adviser John Bolton abruptly ended the meeting when investigations were mentioned. Hill said Bolton told her to report the incident to council lawyers and that he wasn\u2019t part of whatever \u201cdrug deal\u201d that Sondland and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney were \"cooking up.\"\n\nUnder Republican questioning, Sondland said he was surprised to hear the complaints because he thought the meeting ended well, with pictures on the White House lawn on a sunny day.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's skepticism toward Ukraine\n\nRep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, highlighted Trump\u2019s reason for skepticism about Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption efforts in requesting investigations. Nunes said Democratic operatives tried to discredit the 2016 Trump campaign with Ukrainian sources.\n\n\u201cWho were these Democratic operatives who were dirtying up the Trump campaign in 2016?\u201d Nunes asked.\n\nSondland confirmed that he had told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition that Trump was skeptical about Ukraine during a May 23 meeting at the White House.\n\n\u201cI think he said: 'they tried to take me down.' He kept saying that over and over,\u201d Sondland said in the deposition.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff: Sondland\u2019s testimony goes to heart of matter\n\nDuring a break in the hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201cgoes right to the heart\u201d of the investigation on Ukraine that House Democrats are pursuing.\n\nSchiff said the ambassador's testimony was \u201camong the most significant evidence to date.\u201d\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nPence, Pompeo were \u2018in the loop\u2019\n\nGordon Sondland said Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were kept informed of the pressure campaign on Ukraine to open investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cI mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,\u201d Sondland said Sept. 1 before a meeting between Pence and Zelensky.\n\nSondland submitted to lawmakers emails he had written to Pompeo and other Trump administration officials.\n\nA July 19 email from Sondland to Pompeo, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and other officials carried the subject line \u201cRe: I Talked to Zelensky just now.\u201d It said Zelensky was prepared to receive a call from Trump\n\n\u201cHe is prepared to receive Potus' call. Will assure him [Trump] that he [Zelensky] intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone,\u2019\u201d Sondland wrote.\n\nSondland on Pence and Pompeo:'Everyone was in the loop,' ambassador says about high-level efforts to pressure Ukraine\n\nBoth Perry and Mulvaney responded to Sondland\u2019s email.\n\nOn Aug. 11, Sondland sent an email to State Department officials and addressed to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cMike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Ze[lensky] to be delivered for our review in a day or two,\u201d Sondland wrote \u201cThe contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Ze plans to have a big presser on the openness subject (including specifics) next week.\u201d\n\nSondland said a top State Department official, Lisa Kenna, responded that she would pass the note to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nPence's office denies Sondland testimony\n\nMarc Short, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, disputed Sondland\u2019s testimony about speaking with Pence in Warsaw on Sept. 1 about investigations, saying it never happened.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,\u201d Short said. \u201cAmbassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland. This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.\u201d\n\nShort also noted that multiple witnesses had said Pence never mentioned Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden or Burisma before or after the Sept. 1 meeting.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSondland's key statements:Gordon Sondland's impeachment inquiry testimony\n\nCall to Trump from Ukraine restaurant\n\nGordon Sondland confirmed he spoke with Trump on his cell phone on July 26, a day after the president had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDavid Holmes, a State Department official at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, told lawmakers in a closed-door deposition last week that he overheard Sondland's July 26 call with Trump and said the president asked whether Zelensky was going to open the investigation he sought.\n\nSondland said he was at a Kyiv restaurant, as Holmes also said, and the call lasted five minutes.\n\n\"Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It is true that the President speaks loudly at times,\" he said Wednesday.\n\n\"It is true that the President likes to use colorful language,\" he added, referring to the expletives mentioned in Holmes' recall of the conversation.\n\nSondland added though he did not remember the precise details of the conversation, noting the White House prohibited him from seeing any readouts of the call. He said that at the time, he did not think the conversation was significant.\n\n\"Actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president's concerns,\" he said.\n\nBut he said he had no recollection of discussing Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter on the call or after it ended. Holmes told House investigators Sondland told him after the call that Trump only cared about \"big things\" that benefited him, like \"this Biden investigation that Giuliani is pushing.\"\n\nAsked by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff if he had anything to dispute in Holmes' recollection of the call, Sondland said he didn't, though he did not recall mentioning Biden.\n\n\u201cI do not recall mentioning the Bidens. It was Burisma and the 2016 election,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the July 26 call with Sondland, Trump said: \"I know nothing about that. First time I've heard it. The one thing I've seen that Sondland said was that he did speak to me with for a brief moment and I said 'no quid pro quo under any circumstances.'\"\n\n\"And that's true. But I've never heard this. In any event, it is more secondhand information, but I've never heard it,\" Trump told reporters last week.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian and Nicholas Wu\n\nGrisham: \u2018Democrats keep chasing ghosts\u2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement on Sondland\u2019s testimony, highlighting how Trump told the ambassador there was \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo quid pro quo ever occurred,\u201d she said, denying the conditioning of security assistance on the opening of investigations.\n\n\u201cDemocrats keep chasing ghosts,\u201d she concluded.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSondland: Trump cared about announcement, not actual investigation\n\nIn response to a question from Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Gordon Sondland said Rudy Giuliani had conveyed to him that what mattered most to Donald Trump was the public announcement of the investigations, not the investigations themselves.\n\n\u201cHe had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them,\" Sondland said of the president\u2019s demands as expressed through Giuliani.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nNunes compares Ukraine outreach to George Washington\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, compared the Ukraine outreach to George Washington\u2019s diplomacy with Great Britain in his opening statement.\n\n\u201cI would remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president, George Washington, directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with Great Britain. If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794, they\u2019d probably want to impeach him, too,\u201d Nunes said.\n\nHe also lashed out at \u201cpartisan extremists\u201d who transformed the Intelligence Committee into an \u201cImpeachment Committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have exploited the Intelligence Committee for political purposes for three years, culminating in these impeachment hearings,\u201d he said.\n\n-- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff lays out Sondland's role in Ukraine saga\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, began his opening remarks by laying out the Democratic case of impeachment against President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Trump\u2019s scheme undermined military and diplomatic support for a key ally and undercut U.S. anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nSchiff recounted Sondland's role in the Ukrainian saga, placing him in key moments in the timeline and underscoring his importance as a witness to whether Trump abused his power. The top Democrat described Sondland as a \"skilled dealmaker\" who \"found himself increasingly embroiled in an effort to press the new Ukrainian President that deviated sharply from the norm, in terms of both policy and process.\"\n\n\"Now, it is up to Congress, as the people\u2019s representatives to determine what response is appropriate,\" he said after recalling the events in Ukraine.\n\n\"If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts \u2013 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2013 it will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency,\" Schiff said.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nWhy Sondland's testimony matters\n\nIn an addendum to his original testimony, Sondland said he communicated a quid pro quo to a top Ukrainian presidential adviser, Andriy Yermak.\n\n\"I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak, where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland said.\n\nDavid Holmes, a State Department official in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that he overheard a call between Sondland and Trump in which Trump asked Sondland about \"investigations.\"\n\nAccording to Holmes, Sondland assured Trump that Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cloves your a--\u201d and would do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d about investigations.\n\nHolmes said, \"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'\"\n\nHow to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage\n\nMore:Aide testifies Sondland told Trump that Zelensky would 'do anything you ask him to'\n\nHolmes also told lawmakers that when he asked Sondland \"if it was true that the President did not 'give a s--- about Ukraine,\" Sondland replied that Trump only cared about \"big stuff\" that worked to Trump's personal benefit like investigations into his political adversaries.\n\nOther testimony has indicated that Sondland was in contact with Trump as he waged a \"parallel\" campaign of diplomacy that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said was like a \"drug deal.\"\n\nNational Security Council official Tim Morrison told members of Congress and staff behind closed doors that Sondland told him \"the President was giving him instruction\" related to the \"parallel\" campaign to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Trump's political adversaries.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the President was giving him instruction,\u201d Morrison said of a conversation with Sondland.\n\nAnd before the July 25 call, Sondland emailed Morrison and other White House staff to say \u201che had spoken to the President that morning to brief him on the call.\u201d\n\nRecounting a later conversation between Morrison and Sondland, Morrison said Trump told Sondland \u201cthere was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to do it and he should want to do it.\u201d\n\nWhat Hale and Cooper have said\n\nThe officials testifying in the afternoon are expected to shed further light on the campaign to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and the withholding of aid.\n\nCooper oversees Ukrainian policy at the Pentagon and previously told lawmakers and staff in her closed-door testimony how it became clear after Trump's call with Zelensky how the nearly $400 million of security aid was being withheld as \u201cit relates to the President's concerns about corruption.\u201d\n\nHale testified behind closed doors about Yovanovitch's ouster.\n\nWhen asked who would decide against releasing a statement in support of Yovanovitch in light of the \"smear\" campaign against her, he said it would have been \"someone more senior than me.\"\n\n\"Given my position in the State Department, it could only have been someone more senior to me. The Secretary most likely would have been the person.\"",
