    "content": "The Mueller report \u2014 at least the redacted version \u2014 was publicly released Thursday morning and will immediately become the most scrutinized US government document in recent memory .\nMembers of Congress , administration officials , journalists , and members of the public are all poring over the redacted report \u2019 s several hundred pages , seeking to understand what special counsel Robert Mueller found out about Russian interference with the 2016 investigation , and whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice .\nAs someone who has covered the Mueller investigation since it started , there are several broad questions on what it all means that I \u2019 ve had since Attorney General William Barr announced the probe \u2019 s \u201c principal conclusions . \u201d\nFirst , on potential Trump campaign collusion with Russia , is the report \u2019 s takeaway that there was nothing there , or just nothing criminally prosecutable ? Second , why did Mueller punt on obstruction of justice ? Third , what did Mueller actually find on obstruction \u2014 and why do some of his team members reportedly think it \u2019 s \u201c alarming and significant \u201d ?\nThe answers to all these will do much to shape our understanding of the investigation that \u2019 s loomed larger over Trump \u2019 s presidency than any other \u2014 assuming we \u2019 ll get satisfying answers at all . The fourth , and perhaps most critical question is how much of the report we \u2019 ll be able to read , versus how much will be redacted . That could determine just how conclusive the Mueller report \u2019 s release will feel .\n1 ) Did Mueller conclude there was no collusion \u2014 or just that he couldn \u2019 t bring a charge ?\nThe FBI began investigating whether any Trump campaign associates were involved in Russian interference with the election all the way back in July 2016 . Barr \u2019 s letter , though , made clear that Mueller wouldn \u2019 t charge any American with criminally conspiring with the Russian government for such a purpose .\nSo President Trump and his allies have claimed vindication . They \u2019 ve argued that , just as Trump long said , this proves there was \u201c no collusion. \u201d Longtime left-leaning skeptics of the Russia probe have made similar claims , claiming Mueller \u2019 s findings \u201c debunked \u201d the \u201c completely false and baseless conspiracy theories \u201d about a Trump-Russia conspiracy .\nBut some commentators have cautioned against jumping to such a conclusion based only on Mueller \u2019 s decision not to file charges on the matter . \u201c Without seeing Mueller \u2019 s full report , we don \u2019 t know whether this is a firm conclusion about lack of coordination or a frank admission of insufficient evidence , \u201d defense attorney Ken White wrote at the Atlantic .\nIndeed , it \u2019 s certainly going too far to claim there was \u201c nothing \u201d going on between Trump \u2019 s team and Russia . Mueller has extensively documented that the Trump Organization was secretly in talks for a potentially very lucrative Moscow real estate deal during the campaign , and that Russian government officials got involved . Meanwhile , Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort handed over Trump polling data to a Russian intelligence-tied associate . Two Trump associates appear to have had some advance knowledge about Democratic emails that had been hacked by Russians . And , of course , there was the infamous meeting Don Jr. took at Trump Tower .\nIt \u2019 s entirely possible that despite all this , no actual conspiracy between Trump \u2019 s team and the Russian government to interfere with the election ended up happening . Mueller \u2019 s decision not to file charges could reflect that straightforward judgment : that he flat-out found no collusion . But it could also reflect a murkier situation , involving conflicting evidence , legal gray areas , or misconduct that doesn \u2019 t fit neatly into the category of \u201c collusion. \u201d The report should tell us more .\n2 ) Why didn \u2019 t Mueller make a traditional prosecutorial recommendation on obstruction of justice ?\nThe second question I \u2019 ll be looking to the report to answer relates to a surprising bit of information in Barr \u2019 s letter .\nAfter making a \u201c thorough factual investigation \u201d into whether Trump obstructed justice , Barr wrote , Mueller \u201c ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment , \u201d neither asserting Trump broke the law nor exonerating him .\nBarr then stepped up to do that exonerating , saying that in his view , the evidence wasn \u2019 t sufficient to establish Trump committed an obstruction of justice offense . But what Barr did not explain is why Mueller decided not to come to a conclusion one way or the other here .\nThe attorney general \u2019 s letter says that Mueller evaluated \u201c \u2018 difficult issues \u2019 of law and fact concerning whether the President \u2019 s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction , \u201d and laid out evidence on \u201c both sides of the question . \u201d\nSo some have floated the theory that Mueller may have intended to leave this topic to Congress , not Barr , to evaluate , because it \u2019 s the legislative branch \u2019 s job to decide whether the president committed an impeachable offense . There \u2019 s no actual evidence for this right now , but the report may shed more light on what Mueller \u2019 s team expected here .\n3 ) What did Mueller find out about obstruction of justice \u2014 and why do some on his team think it \u2019 s worse for Trump than Barr let on ?\nThen , of course , there \u2019 s the question of what exactly Mueller did find about Trump and obstruction .\nMueller team members have told associates their evidence here is \u201c alarming and significant , \u201d per the Washington Post . And some of them feel Barr \u2019 s letter to Congress didn \u2019 t properly describe \u201c derogatory information , \u201d according to CNN .\nI recently wrote a longer piece summing up what we know about the obstruction case already \u2014 a lengthy pattern of apparent interference with the Russia investigation , encompassing Trump \u2019 s pressures on government officials , his firing of FBI Director James Comey , and his interactions with Russia probe witnesses and defendants .\nBarr \u2019 s letter also says that \u201c most \u201d of the presidential actions Mueller analyzed in the obstruction report have \u201c been the subject of public reporting. \u201d But most is not all . And the Mueller report does include new material on this topic that \u2019 s not publicly known , one official told NBC News .\nSo I \u2019 ll be looking for any new information or evidence on this topic in the report that will help answer the question of why some Mueller team members seem so alarmed \u2014 and why Barr seems unperturbed .\n4 ) How much will Barr redact , and will he explain each redaction ?\nFinally , hanging over all the above is the question of just how much of Mueller \u2019 s report we \u2019 ll even get to see .\nBarr isn \u2019 t releasing the full Mueller report . He \u2019 s releasing a version that the Justice Department has redacted , to hide four main categories of information : grand jury material , information relating to ongoing investigations , disclosures that could compromise sources and methods , and material that compromises peripheral figures \u2019 privacy rights .\nDuring a congressional subcommittee hearing Tuesday , Barr testified that each redaction in the report would be accompanied by \u201c explanatory notes \u201d on the reason for the redaction ( that is , which of the four categories it falls into ) .\nBarr also reiterated that there are currently no plans to assert executive privilege to redact other information in the report . And he stressed that it wasn \u2019 t him personally deciding what to redact , but rather Justice Department officials , Mueller team members , and intelligence officials .\nDespite all this , we don \u2019 t yet know whether redactions will be applied in a reasonable and limited way \u2014 or whether they \u2019 ll be overused to hide an excessive amount of information , with pages and pages blacked out . Liberally applied black bars can be cover for a whole lot of mischief .\nOne encouraging sign is that Mueller \u2019 s team reportedly prepared summaries of their findings that they expected could be made public quickly . If these are made public as part of the full report , they could remove any further ambiguity about what Mueller and his team believe they \u2019 ve found ( even if the actual body of the report remains full of redactions ) .\nDemocrats and media outlets will likely try , through legal challenges , to see more of what \u2019 s under any redactions . But the sheer number of redactions will likely be key in determining whether the report \u2019 s release definitively provides closure to the Trump-Russia investigation \u2014 or whether it will only stoke further questions about what information is being held back .\nFor more on the investigations into the president , follow Andrew Prokop on Twitter and check out \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s guide to the Trump-Russia investigation .",
