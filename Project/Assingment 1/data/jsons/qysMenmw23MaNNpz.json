DeMille Award for her contributions to the entertainment industry . Her call to arms for lifting up and empowering the voices of everyday women in America was a perfect crescendo for the evening \u2019 s Time \u2019 s Up initiative . But as with every rousing speech from a celebrity these days , social-media sentiment soon turned to wishing\u2014nay , demanding\u2014that Winfrey run for president .\nIt was mildly amusing when people suggested America \u2019 s most beloved actor , Dwayne \u201c The Rock \u201d Johnson , run for president , but then people began to seriously ask him whether or not he would run . Then he told Variety he would \u201c 100 percent run for president \u201d with the caveat , \u201c Realistically , as we go into 2018 , when you look at my slate as we \u2019 re developing and shooting into 2019 and 2020 , the slate goes deep into 2021 , so it feels like the realistic consideration would be 2024 . \u201d\nI \u2019 d rather see The Rock as a fictional president at the movies than see him having to decide whether or not to push the \u201c button \u201d and start a war with North Korea . I \u2019 d also rather see a presidential candidate who doesn \u2019 t have to decide which Jumanji sequel they need to reorder before they run for the highest office in the land . I \u2019 d like to think a presidential candidate should be compelled to right the course of our nation . To entertain the idea that you can decide to become president after you shuffle a few projects for convenience belies the misogynistic attacks we lobby at politicians like Hillary Clinton and Kirsten Gillibrand for perceived transparent opportunism .\nThe same goes for Oprah . It \u2019 s easy to understand why people want her to run . Donald Trump rode a wave of celebrity into the White House , having been ingrained in the American consciousness as a wealthy businessman and via weekly television appearances on The Apprentice . In the mind of his voters , their Pavlovian connection to Trump superseded his complete lack of experience at running a country . Trump was previously a liberal-leaning public figure and friendly with Hillary Clinton . He now despises her . He was previously pro-choice and now is pro-life . He previously supported assault-weapons bans and now has a hard-on for the Second Amendment . Which isn \u2019 t to say that Oprah would suddenly start brandishing guns like Proud Mary , but the very nature of being a politician means changing positions you \u2019 ve previously held in order to either win , appease your constituents or get the fucking job done .\nWhen we think of Oprah \u2019 s story about surviving sexual abuse as a child and becoming the most powerful black woman in America , it \u2019 s not only inspirational\u2014it \u2019 s aspirational . Oprah serves as a motivating force for Americans who see in themselves the untapped potential to achieve the same goals . Which is exactly what a celebrity should be . She \u2019 s a former talk-show host , an actress , and an entrepreneur . If Oprah weren \u2019 t completely mesmerizing and charismatic , she wouldn \u2019 t be a damn celebrity . But we \u2019 ve managed to have countless politicians throughout American history who aren \u2019 t celebrities and should continue to do so , because being a celebrity shouldn \u2019 t be a prerequisite for running our country .\nI recognize that Oprah doesn \u2019 t just reverberate emotionally in Hollywood but in America as a whole , but do you understand why that is ? It \u2019 s because Oprah doesn \u2019 t decide how much you pay in taxes . Oprah doesn \u2019 t send drone strikes . Oprah doesn \u2019 t have to be friendly with racist , homophobic or misogynist politicians in order to pass legislature .\nFurthermore , what do we really know about Oprah \u2019 s politics ? She supported Barack Obama , understandably as our first black president . She also supported Hillary Clinton , though not as fervently ( also understandable ) . But speeches like Oprah \u2019 s tonight are meant to be inspiring by drawing upon our history and juxtaposing it with America \u2019 s present . It \u2019 s fiercely political without being political at all . It \u2019 s a call to arms but also an entreaty for compassion . It may remind you of some of Obama \u2019 s more rousing speeches , but if you parse it closer , it will instead remind you of Michelle Obama \u2019 s\u2014another black woman who many Americans have called upon to run for office . But those speeches don \u2019 t do the heavy political lifting that Barack \u2019 s often had to do . When Oprah addresses police brutality , she can speak from her experiences as a black woman in America ; when the president speaks about police brutality , they have to also make sure not to piss off police officers as a whole . Being president comes with compromises that we don \u2019 t require in our celebrities and public figures , and I \u2019 m not sure the Americans who want her to run for president completely comprehend that .\nOprah would probably win . The question is , should she ? For one , is it in America \u2019 s best interest for another billionaire to run for president ? Oprah is a generous queen for sure , but let \u2019 s not pretend that her stepping into the White House would magically mean a new Pontiac arrives on the doorstep of every American who voted for her . Many may believe that Trump \u2019 s rise to power means that the race for the presidency has been irrevocably changed : The flashiest , the most charismatic , the most-liked candidate will always win . Forgoing the traditional route of a politician , the real way to become president now is to be a celebrity\u2014to energize America with your words , your music , your art , and then sway votes .\nThis strikes me as a depressingly nihilistic approach to America \u2019 s future . Trump , for instance , didn \u2019 t win the popular vote and his approval ratings are sinking faster than the chance of anyone beating Three Billboards at the Oscars . One anomaly doesn \u2019 t make a pattern . If Oprah were to run and win , perhaps then we \u2019 d be in a new dystopian era where only celebrities can win presidential elections . But until then , to assume that Trump has altered the very nature of American politics to the point that it can not be course-corrected is pessimism I won \u2019 t subscribe to .\nThe conversation about whether or not Oprah should run for president has always left a sour taste in my mouth . Yes , Oprah electrifies America but that is what we expect her to do as an artist . The idea that this vigor must translate into a political career seems as shortsighted as it does selfish .
