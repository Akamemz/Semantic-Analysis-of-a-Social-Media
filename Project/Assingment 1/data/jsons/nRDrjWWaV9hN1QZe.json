With increased embeddedness of SJA values in institutions and corporations , expect a right-wing countervailing response . Also watch for a fight to define leftism against class-first analysis .\nThis tribe has made a large impact on the cultural landscape , but has not yet made an impact on government policy . Watch for potential conflicts with masculinist black nationalists and the \u201c leaving the plantation \u201d narrative of Candace Owens . Also , keep a look-out for BLM to distance themselves from white allies capitalizing on wokeness .\nPerhaps the fastest growing tribe in recent times , it has moved quickly to redefine the social consensus . Watch for further revelations concerning men in power , followed by more conservative and reactionary backlash .\nThe feminists left behind by trans-inclusive feminists are fighting an uphill battle inside the left . Watch for future mixing with non-left tribes , and more offline culture war .\nNeo-Marxists , while still alive and well in a critical capacity on college campuses , have lost significance since the fall of the Soviet Union . Communism is seen across the political spectrum as discredited . However , given the rising popularity of Democratic Socialists , the memes that Marx birthed could see a revival . If Neo-Marxists can offer a compelling narrative and escape the capitulation and nihilism of Accelerationist thought , they might be able to piggy-back on the DSA \u2019 s popularity . Watch for Douglas Lain \u2019 s Zero Books imprint to capitalize on this opportunity .\nEven without identifiable chieftains , Antifa has played an important part in the culture war and continues to benefit from people \u2019 s fear of Trump and dissatisfaction with mainstream responses . Watch for the normalization of a violent offline culture war .\nThe tribe that coalesced around radical leftism , hope , and physical presence has been shattered . Dormant , it lives on in the 99 % meme and in the pages of Adbusters .\nThe drama of the Bernie campaign and dissatisfaction with the lack of leftism in the Democratic Party has led to a surge in a radical wing of the American left . The ironic fringe still rests at the top of the podcasts , and the push for mainstreaming socialism has been growing ever since Trump \u2019 s election . Watch for further infighting with Social Justice Activists .\nIn reaction to the polarization and catastrophizing they see on both the left and right , this nascent tribe has coalesced around the idea that the world is in fact improving , and whatever challenges society faces can be solved through the institutions and values we currently hold . Watch for an increased presence as neoliberalism converts libertarians and shifts to be embraced as a contrarian ideology .\nThe zeitgeist of our times gives the palpable sense that the establishment left and right are dramatically on the decline , especially amongst millennials and Generation Z . Those in power within the establishment are experiencing increased pressure from rapidly rising elements within their parties . Democratic and liberal parties worldwide are contending with socialist and far-left elements . Conservative parties have seen populists and illiberal democrats take over . And everyone , everywhere , has been blindsided by the rise of white identitarian and nationalist elements . Watch for these tribes to make a last grasp at power during the 2020 elections .\nThe atheist tribes are indirect participants in the culture war . Their shared objective is to attack the religious truth-claims and to plant doubt in the epistemic methodology of believers . The New Atheists lost the relevance they had during the Bush Era when the \u201c Four Horsemen \u201d had great popularity , but their impact has been felt in the noosphere . They contributed to the religious right \u2019 s defeat in Culture War 1.0 by weakening it on philosophical grounds . The Street Epistemologists are the New Atheists \u2019 potential successor in Culture War 2.0 .\nIncubated on Overcoming Bias and LessWrong , this is an observer tribe in the culture war . Though similar to the New Atheists in that they prize rationality , they do not define themselves in opposition to religion . Thanks to the strength of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander \u2019 s writing , and the beliefs and epistemic virtues of the diaspora , they command increasing respect in the culture war . Watch for a popularity boost to Effective Altruism , a struggle with the downsides of increased attention , and possible pressure from the SJAs for the Rationalists to commit to progressive values .\nThis is another observer tribe , and possibly the most interesting one . If the rationalist motto is \u201c the map is not the territory , but it is important to create the most accurate map possible , \u201d then the post-rationalist motto is \u201c the canvas is not the territory , but it is important to create the most interesting canvas possible. \u201d This observer tribe has the potential to generate innovative solutions to the seemingly intractable problem of the differend .\nKen Wilber , who lost some momentum in his \u201c Wyatt Earp \u201d incident , is steadily gaining a strong following amongst cultural influencers . Like the Rationalists and Post-Rationalists , Integralists are an observer tribe . Unlike them , they have a teleological narrative that instills existential hope . This will be a tribe to watch if it moves away from its observer capacity and becomes more active in the war .\nJordan Peterson is the common denominator of these two tribes . One of the most important figures in Culture War 2.0 , his central message emphasizes free speech and the importance of truth-speaking . His following of mostly young men , which we dub the Sorters , are attracted to Peterson \u2019 s style and message of personal responsibility . The \u201c Intellectual Dark Web , \u201d coined by Eric Weinstein , consists of thinkers who have experienced what they view as thought-policing by politically correct elements of the left . With the ever-increasing popularity of Peterson \u2019 s brand and related platforms such as Quillette , the Rubin Report , and the Joe Rogan Experience , watch for both of these tribes to gain members and make a strong push for a return to a classically liberal center in our culture .\nWith a religious right increasingly subservient to Trump , it is becoming incumbent for Christians who put faith first to organize collectively . This memetic tribe is aware of its own mortality and is putting survival before the culture war . Watch for a siphoning of disillusioned Christians and rightists .\nThe religious right is quickly transitioning into a nationalist right . The culture war goals of the Moral Majority have largely been set aside in favor of punishing the left via Trump . Unless there is a public evangelist revival , watch for this tribe to dissolve into Trumpists and Benedictines over the next few years .\nSince its decline following the 2013 government shutdown , this tribe has largely been subsumed by the Trumpists . Watch for a continued decline in libertarian activism as believers drift towards Trump or neoliberalism .\nThis new tribe makes up for a lack of experience and policy through power and \u201c high energy. \u201d They are engaged in a fight for control over the mainstream perception of conservatism with a blindsided establishment right . Watch for a push for votes from racial minorities and a scramble to stay in line with Trump \u2019 s thought .\nThese are the conspiracy theory tribes of the culture war . Alex Jones and Infowars represent \u201c established \u201d conspiracies such as the New World Order and Illuminati . With his manic energy , Jones has successfully turned conspiracy into a profitable business . QAnon is a grassroots emergence of conspiracy theories originating on /pol/ . Given the intense passion their reality tunnel engenders , we speculate that QAnon will grow amongst Trumpists and will be censored on social media platforms , which will only further fuel its growth .\nThese three tribes are concerned with issues surrounding white people and are often lumped together by the mainstream media , but they are actively fighting amongst themselves ( \u201c punching right \u201d ) in order to create distance and avoid conflation . The Alt-Lite would be quick to point out that they are less defined by white identity and more by western chauvinism , an unapologetic view that western culture is the best . Watch for massive fluctuations and changes in the composition of all three , and a continued fight amongst themselves to gain adherents .\nThis semi-dormant tribe has partly been subsumed into the Alt-Right . Lack of public direction from its key figures has led to a decline in influence . Watch for Nick Land \u2019 s return to the blogosphere and keep an eye on Social Matter and the Hestia Society for a potential revival .\nLike the dissident right tribes , these masculine tribes are usually lumped together . Like the far-right tribes , these masculinist tribes also signal to create distance from each other . The Manosphere , the largest of the three tribes , reached its peak around Gamergate and has lost momentum due to its lack of a non-hedonistic strategy , and due to men \u2019 s attention being divided by the competing message of Jordan Peterson . See a continued declined with these three groups , unless new voices emerge .\nThese self-described involuntary celibates could be placed in the masculinist cluster if not for their view of themselves as having been \u201c black-pilled \u201d instead of \u201c red-pilled. \u201d They agree with most of the descriptive views of the masculinist tribes , but see their situation as radically hopeless and unfair . The more extreme adherents have a belief space that shares more with terrorist groups like ISIS than any of the memetic tribes listed above . Copycat attacks mimicking Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian might grow in number unless a memeplex emerges that can inspire and provide meaning to sexually unsuccessful males in society .\nWe conclude this white paper by offering speculative proposals that are not meant to treat the culture war as a solvable problem , but as an opportunity for personal and collective growth .\nWe view the noosphere as an emergent phenomenon , a consequence of globalization and digitalization . When Pierre Teilhard de Chardin introduced the term , he adopted a teleological perspective and saw the collective consciousness of humanity developing towards an \u201c Omega Point. \u201d While we are agnostic about whether there is an endpoint , we do think that looking at the noosphere as being in the process of evolution can help with regards to making speculative proposals . In this section we shift our focus from seeing memetic tribes as individual entities to viewing them as fragments of the larger noosphere .\nBruce Tuckman , a psychology researcher in group dynamics , established his famous \u201c stages of group development \u201d model in 1965 . He believed that there were four necessary stages that newly formed groups need to progress through in order to tackle their shared challenges . The first stage is forming , when a team first comes together and individuals , mainly focused on themselves , operate with a degree of politeness . The second stage is storming , when comfort within the group allows for conflicting opinions to be voiced . Team members may wrestle for control of the group \u2019 s values and goals . The third stage is norming , when \u201c resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy , and a spirit of cooperation emerges. \u201d The fourth stage is performing , where , with \u201c group norms and roles established , group members focus on achieving common goals , often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success . \u201d\nNot all groups are successful . Some abort during the storming phase \u2014 and if we apply this model to the noosphere , we see that all the memetic tribes are in the midst of it . The emergent collective consciousness of the internet began as the relatively innocent forming stage of Web 1.0 . Now that we are in the storming phase , we are plagued by mobs , trolls , and doxxing .\nIf we are to survive as a species , we must address our collective challenges and existential risks \u2014 from rogue A.I . to environmental disaster . To do so , we \u2019 re going to have to build the bridge from storming to norming . This norming phase may not involve feel-good utopianism , but it must involve deep negotiations and compromises between tribes , or alternatively , a peaceful geopolitical instantiation of the growing memetic divides .\nThese eight speculative proposals are meant as a launching pad for discussion . They are not proposals for government or corporate policy . Rather , they are ideas for readers to explore , small but meaningful steps to push against the overwhelming whirlwind of the culture war . It is our hope that interested minds and entrepreneurial spirits will take these proposals and advance them further .\nThe Hippocratic Oath was an oath that physicians were required to take before they began practicing medicine . Its modern iteration is a rite of passage for graduates of some medical schools . While today the oath is not a binding contract , there is a degree of ritualistic magic in formally committing to ideals . Could there be a Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath ? One that chieftains of the memetic tribes could affirm ? It would prove beneficial if journalists , authors , bloggers , and professors alike took this oath , but any social media user could take the oath , by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e-badge . Promises can be broken , but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback .\nWhat would this Oath consist of ? At the bare minimum : a commitment to good faith dialogue , the principle of charity , and intellectual humility . The last virtue is critical . A caveat of \u201c I could be wrong \u201d underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult conversations , a shared commitment to that caveat helps even more . If enough culture warriors take such an Oath , it could pave the way for a Geneva Convention of the Culture War .\nIt is increasingly hard for media outlets to approximate \u201c performative neutrality , \u201d thanks to the perverse incentives of outrage porn and the need to appease dwindling subscribers for survival . Is there a way to satisfy the collective hunger for \u201c unbiased news \u201d ? While we try to figure that out , cynicism spreads , as rightists increasingly find traditional media \u2019 s claims of neutrality laughable . Is there an alternative ?\nWe could all start by putting our skin in the game , by being honest about our biases and tribal affiliations . We could abandon the pretense to neutrality and more honestly engage with each other , knowing where we stand . Arguments could go to our philosophical foundations more quickly , instead of expending themselves on object-level disagreement .\nWe call this \u201c clean bias , \u201d an admission of an epistemic framework and value structure . It is in contrast to \u201c dirty bias , \u201d unspoken and denied framework and values while purporting universality . Thanks to the reality crisis , we are shedding our faith in universally imposed and agreed-upon truths . Clean bias is a necessary part of a new peace in our fractured reality . A first step could be for memetic creators , from journalists to bloggers , to commit to including their foundational presumptions in their bios .\nDebate is broken . Nobody actually likes \u201c gotcha interviews \u201d or debates plagued with strawmanning , question-begging , bad faith , and side-stepping . Debate needs to be rebuilt . We suggest that debate currently tries to inhabit two contradictory roles . On the one hand , it is a source of entertainment through combat ; On the other , it is an avenue for improved understanding and wisdom . We propose that these two roles should be formally separated into distinct types of debates : Sport Debates and Sensemaking Debates .\nIn Sport Debates , participants debate for combat and entertainment . This would gamify the desire to engage in verbal combat for its own sake , with truth as a potential byproduct . They could be viewed as the UFC of the mind . While it may seem cynical to sponsor an avenue for the fiery and often toxic form debates can take , we think that diverting those urges away from sensemaking desires is a good harm-reduction strategy .\nIn Sensemaking Debates , participants debate for understanding and exploration . This would allow the purported values of debate to actually flourish . This can also include philosophical sandboxing , the adoption of ideologies as a method actor . Spaces could be made where participants take on ideological roles so as to better understand them , and to develop the skill to take them off .\nDavid Brin \u2019 s idea of \u201c Disputation Arenas \u201d and William MacAskill \u2019 s \u201c Anti-Debates \u201d can map over to the two types of debates , with Bryan Caplan \u2019 s \u201c Ideological Turing Test \u201d as another potential modality that falls somewhere between both types . Peter , the co-author of this white paper , has been experimenting with both of these debate modalities inside his Intellectual Explorers Club . He welcomes suggestions and participants .\nDue to technological innovation , industries are being disrupted the world-over , from the sharing economy to AI developments . We suggest that it is time for philosophy to endure similar disruptions . In Disabling Professions , Ivan Illich argues that professionalization can have a damaging effect on society , as expert culture induces knowledge-distance , blindness , and reliance on experts by non-experts . While Illich \u2019 s focus was the medical establishment , this also applies to philosophy , which has been inaccessible to most non-professionals for decades . This has in turn led to a sense of philosophy \u2019 s irrelevance amongst non-academics .\nBut as practical philosopher Andrew Taggart points out , philosophy is much more than an academic discipline , it is as a way of life : \u201c Philosophy is not theoretical discourse but a way of being . Philosophical discourse , accordingly , appears only when necessary and is always put in the service of leading a certain kind of life. \u201d Indeed , we are seeing the beginnings of a reclaiming of philosophy as a way of life in the new popularity of the longform podcast and of philosophies of virtue , such as Stoicism .\nOur hope is that with these and other disruptions to the philosophical status quo , people will gain the tools to think critically and avoid being drawn into convenient and prepackaged worldviews . Philosophy could be a guard against the pressure to join an existing memetic tribe . R.J. Hollingdale \u2019 s aphorism may come to fruition : \u201c If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones . \u201d\nA new role might be required in the Culture War , that of the Memetic Mediator . This mediator would be a pan-tribalist participant who has the ability to communicate across tribes in a way that seems fair and reasonable to each tribe . They would have the mental agility , empathy , and wisdom needed to shift between a multitude of perspectives .\nMemetic mediators could be called in for memetic battles where both participants prefer peace to continued civil decay , but can not come to an accord without facilitation . These mediators would require a multitude of tools at their disposal . They would need to be fluent in multiple tribal paradigms and give the impression of fairness . And because each tribe has their own method and claims to truth , Memetic Mediators would have to be skilled at finding any common ground and building from it .\nAs we do not have an existing example to point to , we can only speculate that the role will emerge out of necessity in the coming war . They could even emerge as consultants for social media companies .\nVenkatesh Rao has introduced the term \u201c grey pilling , \u201d which he views as the third pill in the blue-red pill dichotomy . Blue pills are unquestioned consensus realities we are socialized into . A red pill , as Venkatesh puts it , is :\na dose of information that awakens you to the existence of a world beyond the one you are unconsciously immersed in , like a fish being taken out of water . Red-pill moments sensitize you to the previously invisible boundaries and structural lies of the world you knew , and make you alive to astounding possibilities beyond it .\nA grey pill , according to Venkatesh , is the process of \u201c relearning the value of questioning and doubt after you \u2019 ve been seduced by answers and certainties ; it \u2019 s leaving comforting \u2018 secret \u2019 societies for continued intellectual growth. \u201d Grey pills can engender an existential crisis , but at the right dose they can provide a confident unknowing and a sexy uncertainty , what Stephen Fry calls \u201c passionate and positive doubt. \u201d In a world of tyrannical certainty , grey pilling may be an ethical act .\nIn 1964 , Ken Kesey , smitten with the experience that LSD provided him , drove around the country with his Merry Band of Pranksters and offered \u201c acid tests \u201d to anyone they could find with the intent to open minds and transform the consciousness of society . Some may argue that they were successful in doing so , as his adventures chronicled in Tom Wolfe \u2019 s book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test are credited with giving birth to the hippie movement . What if we grey-pilled the way Kesey acid-tested ?\nThis would be the return of Socrates , the original gadfly , who grey-pilled anyone who dared to converse with him . The method of the Street Epistemologists are instructive and may be repurposed for this proposal . Their conversational method of innocently starting dialog is well-structured , but instead of atheists inquiring into the epistemic methodology of their \u201c irrational \u201d interlocutors , performative agnostics could inquire with the intention to get mutually , philosophically lost . This may be our most dangerous , and most fun , speculation .\nManagement theorist Robert Katz made a distinction between three critical skills for professional success : technical skills , conceptual skills , and human skills . Technical skills are practical skill-sets that can be mastered . Conceptual skills are effective ways of thinking about complex problems . And human skills can be understood as the ability to connect with what is \u201c human \u201d about another person . While the \u201c marketing mentality \u201d invokes the need for social skills , which are instrumental towards salesmanship or leadership persuasion , \u201c human skills \u201d invokes the framework of authentic relationships with other humans . It has the potential to lend itself to a non-instrumental view of relationships . In Buberian terms , this is a movement from an I-It way of relating to one of I-Thou .\nThe Authentic Relating and Circling Movement aims to cultivate WE Spaces , which are intersubjective I-Thou spaces where collective consciousness can emerge . For individuals concerned by their own culpability in the Culture War , these spaces give an opportunity to develop Human Skills . We speculate that if one becomes skilled at relating to another for its own sake , across tribal affiliation , it may allow people to bypass tribalistic affinities and a Protean Tribalism to emerge . One \u2019 s tribe would be fluid and context-based , in contrast to the increasingly rigid identities we currently find comfort in .\nThe Culture War is a vicious cycle \u2014 those who suffer from it feel they have to perpetuate it . Initiating conversations about alternatives can be the start of a positive feedback loop . Individuals looking to improve the atmosphere in their communities could initiate workshops to that end .\nA promising example to this end is the OpenMind platform . As per its website , \u201c OpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses , companies , organizations , and communities . OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding , while equipping them with the essential cognitive skills to engage constructively across differences. \u201d A combination of online program and workshop , OpenMind is one avenue to develop viewpoint diversity and diffuse political tensions in relationships . Any organized , good faith approach to repairing fraying communities is likely to have a positive effect .",
    "content_original": "Below are some further comments and our speculations on how the tribes will evolve in Culture War 2.0.\n\nSJA\n\nWhile this tribe engages in full-out war with other tribes, they continue to make gains in legacy media, corporate HR and PR departments, and government institutions. With increased embeddedness of SJA values in institutions and corporations, expect a right-wing countervailing response. Also watch for a fight to define leftism against class-first analysis.\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nThis tribe has made a large impact on the cultural landscape, but has not yet made an impact on government policy. Watch for potential conflicts with masculinist black nationalists and the \u201cleaving the plantation\u201d narrative of Candace Owens. Also, keep a look-out for BLM to distance themselves from white allies capitalizing on wokeness.\n\n#MeToo\n\nPerhaps the fastest growing tribe in recent times, it has moved quickly to redefine the social consensus. Watch for further revelations concerning men in power, followed by more conservative and reactionary backlash.\n\nGender-Critical Feminists\n\nThe feminists left behind by trans-inclusive feminists are fighting an uphill battle inside the left. Watch for future mixing with non-left tribes, and more offline culture war.\n\nModern Neo-Marxists\n\nNeo-Marxists, while still alive and well in a critical capacity on college campuses, have lost significance since the fall of the Soviet Union. Communism is seen across the political spectrum as discredited. However, given the rising popularity of Democratic Socialists, the memes that Marx birthed could see a revival. If Neo-Marxists can offer a compelling narrative and escape the capitulation and nihilism of Accelerationist thought, they might be able to piggy-back on the DSA\u2019s popularity. Watch for Douglas Lain\u2019s Zero Books imprint to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nAntifa\n\nEven without identifiable chieftains, Antifa has played an important part in the culture war and continues to benefit from people\u2019s fear of Trump and dissatisfaction with mainstream responses. Watch for the normalization of a violent offline culture war.\n\nOccupy\n\nThe tribe that coalesced around radical leftism, hope, and physical presence has been shattered. Dormant, it lives on in the 99% meme and in the pages of Adbusters.\n\nDSA and Dirtbag Left\n\nThe drama of the Bernie campaign and dissatisfaction with the lack of leftism in the Democratic Party has led to a surge in a radical wing of the American left. The ironic fringe still rests at the top of the podcasts, and the push for mainstreaming socialism has been growing ever since Trump\u2019s election. Watch for further infighting with Social Justice Activists.\n\nOptimists\n\nIn reaction to the polarization and catastrophizing they see on both the left and right, this nascent tribe has coalesced around the idea that the world is in fact improving, and whatever challenges society faces can be solved through the institutions and values we currently hold. Watch for an increased presence as neoliberalism converts libertarians and shifts to be embraced as a contrarian ideology.\n\nEstablishment Left and Right\n\nThe zeitgeist of our times gives the palpable sense that the establishment left and right are dramatically on the decline, especially amongst millennials and Generation Z. Those in power within the establishment are experiencing increased pressure from rapidly rising elements within their parties. Democratic and liberal parties worldwide are contending with socialist and far-left elements. Conservative parties have seen populists and illiberal democrats take over. And everyone, everywhere, has been blindsided by the rise of white identitarian and nationalist elements. Watch for these tribes to make a last grasp at power during the 2020 elections.\n\nNew Atheists and Street Epistemologists\n\nThe atheist tribes are indirect participants in the culture war. Their shared objective is to attack the religious truth-claims and to plant doubt in the epistemic methodology of believers. The New Atheists lost the relevance they had during the Bush Era when the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d had great popularity, but their impact has been felt in the noosphere. They contributed to the religious right\u2019s defeat in Culture War 1.0 by weakening it on philosophical grounds. The Street Epistemologists are the New Atheists\u2019 potential successor in Culture War 2.0.\n\nRationalist Diaspora\n\nIncubated on Overcoming Bias and LessWrong, this is an observer tribe in the culture war. Though similar to the New Atheists in that they prize rationality, they do not define themselves in opposition to religion. Thanks to the strength of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander\u2019s writing, and the beliefs and epistemic virtues of the diaspora, they command increasing respect in the culture war. Watch for a popularity boost to Effective Altruism, a struggle with the downsides of increased attention, and possible pressure from the SJAs for the Rationalists to commit to progressive values.\n\nPost-Rationalists\n\nThis is another observer tribe, and possibly the most interesting one. If the rationalist motto is \u201cthe map is not the territory, but it is important to create the most accurate map possible,\u201d then the post-rationalist motto is \u201cthe canvas is not the territory, but it is important to create the most interesting canvas possible.\u201d This observer tribe has the potential to generate innovative solutions to the seemingly intractable problem of the differend.\n\nIntegral Theorists\n\nKen Wilber, who lost some momentum in his \u201cWyatt Earp\u201d incident, is steadily gaining a strong following amongst cultural influencers. Like the Rationalists and Post-Rationalists, Integralists are an observer tribe. Unlike them, they have a teleological narrative that instills existential hope. This will be a tribe to watch if it moves away from its observer capacity and becomes more active in the war.\n\nSorters and Intellectual Dark Web\n\nJordan Peterson is the common denominator of these two tribes. One of the most important figures in Culture War 2.0, his central message emphasizes free speech and the importance of truth-speaking. His following of mostly young men, which we dub the Sorters, are attracted to Peterson\u2019s style and message of personal responsibility. The \u201cIntellectual Dark Web,\u201d coined by Eric Weinstein, consists of thinkers who have experienced what they view as thought-policing by politically correct elements of the left. With the ever-increasing popularity of Peterson\u2019s brand and related platforms such as Quillette, the Rubin Report, and the Joe Rogan Experience, watch for both of these tribes to gain members and make a strong push for a return to a classically liberal center in our culture.\n\nBenedictines\n\nWith a religious right increasingly subservient to Trump, it is becoming incumbent for Christians who put faith first to organize collectively. This memetic tribe is aware of its own mortality and is putting survival before the culture war. Watch for a siphoning of disillusioned Christians and rightists.\n\nChristian Right\n\nThe religious right is quickly transitioning into a nationalist right. The culture war goals of the Moral Majority have largely been set aside in favor of punishing the left via Trump. Unless there is a public evangelist revival, watch for this tribe to dissolve into Trumpists and Benedictines over the next few years.\n\nTea Party\n\nSince its decline following the 2013 government shutdown, this tribe has largely been subsumed by the Trumpists. Watch for a continued decline in libertarian activism as believers drift towards Trump or neoliberalism.\n\nTrumpists\n\nThis new tribe makes up for a lack of experience and policy through power and \u201chigh energy.\u201d They are engaged in a fight for control over the mainstream perception of conservatism with a blindsided establishment right. Watch for a push for votes from racial minorities and a scramble to stay in line with Trump\u2019s thought.\n\nInfowarriors and QAnoners\n\nThese are the conspiracy theory tribes of the culture war. Alex Jones and Infowars represent \u201cestablished\u201d conspiracies such as the New World Order and Illuminati. With his manic energy, Jones has successfully turned conspiracy into a profitable business. QAnon is a grassroots emergence of conspiracy theories originating on /pol/. Given the intense passion their reality tunnel engenders, we speculate that QAnon will grow amongst Trumpists and will be censored on social media platforms, which will only further fuel its growth.\n\nAlt-Lite, Alt-Right, and Modern Neo-Nazis\n\nThese three tribes are concerned with issues surrounding white people and are often lumped together by the mainstream media, but they are actively fighting amongst themselves (\u201cpunching right\u201d) in order to create distance and avoid conflation. The Alt-Lite would be quick to point out that they are less defined by white identity and more by western chauvinism, an unapologetic view that western culture is the best. Watch for massive fluctuations and changes in the composition of all three, and a continued fight amongst themselves to gain adherents.\n\nNeoreactionaries\n\nThis semi-dormant tribe has partly been subsumed into the Alt-Right. Lack of public direction from its key figures has led to a decline in influence. Watch for Nick Land\u2019s return to the blogosphere and keep an eye on Social Matter and the Hestia Society for a potential revival.\n\nMRA, Manosphere, MGTOW\n\nLike the dissident right tribes, these masculine tribes are usually lumped together. Like the far-right tribes, these masculinist tribes also signal to create distance from each other. The Manosphere, the largest of the three tribes, reached its peak around Gamergate and has lost momentum due to its lack of a non-hedonistic strategy, and due to men\u2019s attention being divided by the competing message of Jordan Peterson. See a continued declined with these three groups, unless new voices emerge.\n\nIncels\n\nThese self-described involuntary celibates could be placed in the masculinist cluster if not for their view of themselves as having been \u201cblack-pilled\u201d instead of \u201cred-pilled.\u201d They agree with most of the descriptive views of the masculinist tribes, but see their situation as radically hopeless and unfair. The more extreme adherents have a belief space that shares more with terrorist groups like ISIS than any of the memetic tribes listed above. Copycat attacks mimicking Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian might grow in number unless a memeplex emerges that can inspire and provide meaning to sexually unsuccessful males in society.\n\nSpeculative Proposals\n\nWe conclude this white paper by offering speculative proposals that are not meant to treat the culture war as a solvable problem, but as an opportunity for personal and collective growth.\n\nWe view the noosphere as an emergent phenomenon, a consequence of globalization and digitalization. When Pierre Teilhard de Chardin introduced the term, he adopted a teleological perspective and saw the collective consciousness of humanity developing towards an \u201cOmega Point.\u201d While we are agnostic about whether there is an endpoint, we do think that looking at the noosphere as being in the process of evolution can help with regards to making speculative proposals. In this section we shift our focus from seeing memetic tribes as individual entities to viewing them as fragments of the larger noosphere.\n\nBruce Tuckman, a psychology researcher in group dynamics, established his famous \u201cstages of group development\u201d model in 1965. He believed that there were four necessary stages that newly formed groups need to progress through in order to tackle their shared challenges. The first stage is forming, when a team first comes together and individuals, mainly focused on themselves, operate with a degree of politeness. The second stage is storming, when comfort within the group allows for conflicting opinions to be voiced. Team members may wrestle for control of the group\u2019s values and goals. The third stage is norming, when \u201cresolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy, and a spirit of cooperation emerges.\u201d The fourth stage is performing, where, with \u201cgroup norms and roles established, group members focus on achieving common goals, often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success.\u201d\n\nNot all groups are successful. Some abort during the storming phase \u2014 and if we apply this model to the noosphere, we see that all the memetic tribes are in the midst of it. The emergent collective consciousness of the internet began as the relatively innocent forming stage of Web 1.0. Now that we are in the storming phase, we are plagued by mobs, trolls, and doxxing.\n\nIf we are to survive as a species, we must address our collective challenges and existential risks \u2014 from rogue A.I. to environmental disaster. To do so, we\u2019re going to have to build the bridge from storming to norming. This norming phase may not involve feel-good utopianism, but it must involve deep negotiations and compromises between tribes, or alternatively, a peaceful geopolitical instantiation of the growing memetic divides.\n\nThese eight speculative proposals are meant as a launching pad for discussion. They are not proposals for government or corporate policy. Rather, they are ideas for readers to explore, small but meaningful steps to push against the overwhelming whirlwind of the culture war. It is our hope that interested minds and entrepreneurial spirits will take these proposals and advance them further.\n\nIllustration courtesy of Peter Limberg and Conor Barnes\n\nHippocratic Oath of the Cultural War\n\nThe Hippocratic Oath was an oath that physicians were required to take before they began practicing medicine. Its modern iteration is a rite of passage for graduates of some medical schools. While today the oath is not a binding contract, there is a degree of ritualistic magic in formally committing to ideals. Could there be a Culture War equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath? One that chieftains of the memetic tribes could affirm? It would prove beneficial if journalists, authors, bloggers, and professors alike took this oath, but any social media user could take the oath, by pledging their name and accepting some sort of e-badge. Promises can be broken, but breaking public promises can generate swift social feedback.\n\nWhat would this Oath consist of? At the bare minimum: a commitment to good faith dialogue, the principle of charity, and intellectual humility. The last virtue is critical. A caveat of \u201cI could be wrong\u201d underlying strongly held beliefs helps even the most difficult conversations, a shared commitment to that caveat helps even more. If enough culture warriors take such an Oath, it could pave the way for a Geneva Convention of the Culture War.\n\nDirty Bias to Clean Bias\n\nIt is increasingly hard for media outlets to approximate \u201cperformative neutrality,\u201d thanks to the perverse incentives of outrage porn and the need to appease dwindling subscribers for survival. Is there a way to satisfy the collective hunger for \u201cunbiased news\u201d? While we try to figure that out, cynicism spreads, as rightists increasingly find traditional media\u2019s claims of neutrality laughable. Is there an alternative?\n\nWe could all start by putting our skin in the game, by being honest about our biases and tribal affiliations. We could abandon the pretense to neutrality and more honestly engage with each other, knowing where we stand. Arguments could go to our philosophical foundations more quickly, instead of expending themselves on object-level disagreement.\n\nWe call this \u201cclean bias,\u201d an admission of an epistemic framework and value structure. It is in contrast to \u201cdirty bias,\u201d unspoken and denied framework and values while purporting universality. Thanks to the reality crisis, we are shedding our faith in universally imposed and agreed-upon truths. Clean bias is a necessary part of a new peace in our fractured reality. A first step could be for memetic creators, from journalists to bloggers, to commit to including their foundational presumptions in their bios.\n\nReinventing Debate\n\nDebate is broken. Nobody actually likes \u201cgotcha interviews\u201d or debates plagued with strawmanning, question-begging, bad faith, and side-stepping. Debate needs to be rebuilt. We suggest that debate currently tries to inhabit two contradictory roles. On the one hand, it is a source of entertainment through combat; On the other, it is an avenue for improved understanding and wisdom. We propose that these two roles should be formally separated into distinct types of debates: Sport Debates and Sensemaking Debates.\n\nIn Sport Debates, participants debate for combat and entertainment. This would gamify the desire to engage in verbal combat for its own sake, with truth as a potential byproduct. They could be viewed as the UFC of the mind. While it may seem cynical to sponsor an avenue for the fiery and often toxic form debates can take, we think that diverting those urges away from sensemaking desires is a good harm-reduction strategy.\n\nIn Sensemaking Debates, participants debate for understanding and exploration. This would allow the purported values of debate to actually flourish. This can also include philosophical sandboxing, the adoption of ideologies as a method actor. Spaces could be made where participants take on ideological roles so as to better understand them, and to develop the skill to take them off.\n\nDavid Brin\u2019s idea of \u201cDisputation Arenas\u201d and William MacAskill\u2019s \u201cAnti-Debates\u201d can map over to the two types of debates, with Bryan Caplan\u2019s \u201cIdeological Turing Test\u201d as another potential modality that falls somewhere between both types. Peter, the co-author of this white paper, has been experimenting with both of these debate modalities inside his Intellectual Explorers Club. He welcomes suggestions and participants.\n\nDisrupting and Emancipating Philosophy\n\nDue to technological innovation, industries are being disrupted the world-over, from the sharing economy to AI developments. We suggest that it is time for philosophy to endure similar disruptions. In Disabling Professions, Ivan Illich argues that professionalization can have a damaging effect on society, as expert culture induces knowledge-distance, blindness, and reliance on experts by non-experts. While Illich\u2019s focus was the medical establishment, this also applies to philosophy, which has been inaccessible to most non-professionals for decades. This has in turn led to a sense of philosophy\u2019s irrelevance amongst non-academics.\n\nBut as practical philosopher Andrew Taggart points out, philosophy is much more than an academic discipline, it is as a way of life: \u201cPhilosophy is not theoretical discourse but a way of being. Philosophical discourse, accordingly, appears only when necessary and is always put in the service of leading a certain kind of life.\u201d Indeed, we are seeing the beginnings of a reclaiming of philosophy as a way of life in the new popularity of the longform podcast and of philosophies of virtue, such as Stoicism.\n\nOur hope is that with these and other disruptions to the philosophical status quo, people will gain the tools to think critically and avoid being drawn into convenient and prepackaged worldviews. Philosophy could be a guard against the pressure to join an existing memetic tribe. R.J. Hollingdale\u2019s aphorism may come to fruition: \u201cIf we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones.\u201d\n\nMemetic Mediators\n\nA new role might be required in the Culture War, that of the Memetic Mediator. This mediator would be a pan-tribalist participant who has the ability to communicate across tribes in a way that seems fair and reasonable to each tribe. They would have the mental agility, empathy, and wisdom needed to shift between a multitude of perspectives.\n\nMemetic mediators could be called in for memetic battles where both participants prefer peace to continued civil decay, but cannot come to an accord without facilitation. These mediators would require a multitude of tools at their disposal. They would need to be fluent in multiple tribal paradigms and give the impression of fairness. And because each tribe has their own method and claims to truth, Memetic Mediators would have to be skilled at finding any common ground and building from it.\n\nAs we do not have an existing example to point to, we can only speculate that the role will emerge out of necessity in the coming war. They could even emerge as consultants for social media companies.\n\nGrey Pills as Acid Tests\n\nVenkatesh Rao has introduced the term \u201cgrey pilling,\u201d which he views as the third pill in the blue-red pill dichotomy. Blue pills are unquestioned consensus realities we are socialized into. A red pill, as Venkatesh puts it, is:\n\na dose of information that awakens you to the existence of a world beyond the one you are unconsciously immersed in, like a fish being taken out of water. Red-pill moments sensitize you to the previously invisible boundaries and structural lies of the world you knew, and make you alive to astounding possibilities beyond it.\n\nA grey pill, according to Venkatesh, is the process of \u201crelearning the value of questioning and doubt after you\u2019ve been seduced by answers and certainties; it\u2019s leaving comforting \u2018secret\u2019 societies for continued intellectual growth.\u201d Grey pills can engender an existential crisis, but at the right dose they can provide a confident unknowing and a sexy uncertainty, what Stephen Fry calls \u201cpassionate and positive doubt.\u201d In a world of tyrannical certainty, grey pilling may be an ethical act.\n\nIn 1964, Ken Kesey, smitten with the experience that LSD provided him, drove around the country with his Merry Band of Pranksters and offered \u201cacid tests\u201d to anyone they could find with the intent to open minds and transform the consciousness of society. Some may argue that they were successful in doing so, as his adventures chronicled in Tom Wolfe\u2019s book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test are credited with giving birth to the hippie movement. What if we grey-pilled the way Kesey acid-tested?\n\nThis would be the return of Socrates, the original gadfly, who grey-pilled anyone who dared to converse with him. The method of the Street Epistemologists are instructive and may be repurposed for this proposal. Their conversational method of innocently starting dialog is well-structured, but instead of atheists inquiring into the epistemic methodology of their \u201cirrational\u201d interlocutors, performative agnostics could inquire with the intention to get mutually, philosophically lost. This may be our most dangerous, and most fun, speculation.\n\nHuman Skills to Protean Tribalism\n\nManagement theorist Robert Katz made a distinction between three critical skills for professional success: technical skills, conceptual skills, and human skills. Technical skills are practical skill-sets that can be mastered. Conceptual skills are effective ways of thinking about complex problems. And human skills can be understood as the ability to connect with what is \u201chuman\u201d about another person. While the \u201cmarketing mentality\u201d invokes the need for social skills, which are instrumental towards salesmanship or leadership persuasion, \u201chuman skills\u201d invokes the framework of authentic relationships with other humans. It has the potential to lend itself to a non-instrumental view of relationships. In Buberian terms, this is a movement from an I-It way of relating to one of I-Thou.\n\nThe Authentic Relating and Circling Movement aims to cultivate WE Spaces, which are intersubjective I-Thou spaces where collective consciousness can emerge. For individuals concerned by their own culpability in the Culture War, these spaces give an opportunity to develop Human Skills. We speculate that if one becomes skilled at relating to another for its own sake, across tribal affiliation, it may allow people to bypass tribalistic affinities and a Protean Tribalism to emerge. One\u2019s tribe would be fluid and context-based, in contrast to the increasingly rigid identities we currently find comfort in.\n\nWorkshops for Depolarization\n\nThe Culture War is a vicious cycle \u2014 those who suffer from it feel they have to perpetuate it. Initiating conversations about alternatives can be the start of a positive feedback loop. Individuals looking to improve the atmosphere in their communities could initiate workshops to that end.\n\nA promising example to this end is the OpenMind platform. As per its website, \u201cOpenMind is a psychology-based educational platform designed to depolarize campuses, companies, organizations, and communities. OpenMind helps people foster intellectual humility and mutual understanding, while equipping them with the essential cognitive skills to engage constructively across differences.\u201d A combination of online program and workshop, OpenMind is one avenue to develop viewpoint diversity and diffuse political tensions in relationships. Any organized, good faith approach to repairing fraying communities is likely to have a positive effect.",
