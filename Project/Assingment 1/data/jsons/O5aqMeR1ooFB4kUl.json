    "content": "A flood of mainstream Republican officials and donors have lined up behind Marco Rubio in the week since former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush suspended his campaign for president .\nAnd yet Rubio 's team concedes that neither the influx of support , nor the conversion of many of Bush 's wealthy donors , is enough to stop Donald Trump .\nInstead of riding the wave of new support alone , Rubio has been forced to speed up plans for an all-out assault on the billionaire businessman 's character .\nRubio had hoped to wait until the chaotic Republican nominating campaign had shrunk to a two-man race . But with a growing sense of urgency among GOP stalwarts to settle on a Trump alternative , the young Florida senator is trying to simultaneously slow Trump and cast himself the savior of the party 's future .\n`` I will never quit . I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement , '' Rubio thundered at a rally with 2,000 people in Oklahoma City on Friday .\nRubio , a 44-year-old first-term U.S. senator , is trying to project leadership in the party while also going after Trump using his own game , marked by mockery and uncanny aim for his opponent 's vulnerabilities .\nBut the hard-nosed strategy is necessary , says Tennessee Gov . Bill Haslam , Rubio 's latest big endorsement .\n`` Rubio looked around and thought , 'Well , I might not like it , but that 's what the media is covering and that 's what people are responding to . ' ''\nBut Rubio is quickly getting a feel for what he began during Thursday 's debate , launching a direct challenge to Trump 's appeal to working class voters .\nIn recent days , Rubio has dished about Trump 's on-stage perspiration and alluded , jokingly , that Trump may have wet his pants . He 's also taken to referring to the billionaire businessman as a `` con artist '' dozens of times a day while campaigning .\n`` It 's amazing to me . A guy with the worst spray tan in America is attacking me for putting on makeup , '' Rubio charged as he campaigned in Georgia on Saturday . `` Donald Trump likes to sue people . He should sue whoever did that to his face . ''\nOver the weekend , Rubio and Cruz attacked Trump for refusing to condemn the endorsement from David Duke , a former Ku Klux Klan leader .\nWe can not be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan . \u2014 Marco Rubio ( @ marcorubio ) February 28 , 2016\nRubio went further in a message to thousands of supporters in Leesburg , Virginia : `` We can not be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan , '' Rubio said . `` Not only is that wrong , it makes him unelectable . How are we going to grow the party if we nominate someone who does n't repudiate the Ku Klux Klan ? ''\nBut make no mistake : Rubio 's new tack is a fight for survival .\nHe trails Trump in virtually all of the 11 states holding nominating contests on March 1 , known as Super Tuesday . The Florida senator has finished in no better than second place in the first four primary contests . Trump has won three out of four . And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz remains a top-tier contender , even after finishing in third place in the last three contests .\nGiven Trump 's momentum , Rubio 's team says publicly the senator 's best chance for the nomination might be a contested national convention in July . That could happen only if Rubio prevents Trump from accumulating the majority of delegates in the months-long primary season that extends through June .\nSome Florida-based donors , as well as top donors and fundraisers in Washington , D.C. , Chicago and elsewhere were ready to join Rubio 's team immediately after Bush left the race .\n`` There are a number of us , now that Gov . Bush is out of the race , who were very impressed with his debate Thursday , and see him as the one to take down Trump , '' said Chicago investor Craig Duchossois , who shifted from Bush to Rubio . `` He showed he 's not going to take any crap from him . ''\nIn the past two weeks , Rubio has also won the backing of four governors and 20 members of Congress , more than all of his Republican rivals combined .\nRubio had hoped to forestall a one-on-one brawl with Trump until there were only two . Cruz , Ohio Gov . John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race , although none have the level of support from as many governors and members of Congress as Rubio .\nIn a year of the outsider , however , it 's unclear how much that will boost his momentum .\nAnd in the meantime , Rubio 's assault on Trump 's character continues .\nAudiences in Super Tuesday states Oklahoma , Georgia and Alabama ate up the tough talk as he whipped through Southern states .\n`` It 's about time he take his gloves off and start fighting , '' said Gary Baker from Okmulgee , Oklahoma . `` I think he should have started punching sooner . ''\nBetter late than never , said Greg Strimple , a Republican pollster and former adviser to the National Republican Senatorial Committee .\n`` The Rubio campaign needs to set-up a contrast on Trump , equate Trump to the culture of corruption Americans hate \u2014 where the rich get richer and middle class pays the price , '' Strimple said .\n`` If you sense a sense of urgency , it 's not just about winning , '' Rubio said . `` It 's about the idea that the party of Reagan and the conservative movement could fall into the hands of a con man , who 's pulling the ultimate con job on the American people .
