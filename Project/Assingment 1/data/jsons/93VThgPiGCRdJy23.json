But all else is n't equal . To balance out the Democrats ' agenda , Republicans would need to cull big , popular , conservative bills from their own agenda and pass them on contemporaneously in the House . But their agenda is n't exactly littered with popular items . It 's littered with things like trying to throw newly insured poor people off Medicaid , `` trying to create a barrier to [ Affordable Care Act ] enrollment , '' and empowering individuals , businesses , and public officials to discriminate against same-sex spouses . If that 's what Republicans are up to at the state level , it 's probably wise , by comparison , for Republicans in Washington to do literally nothing at all .\nBut there 's more than just aimlessness at work here . The electoral map is also probably creating inertia by making the GOP 's strategy unfalsifiable . This year , Senate Democrats are defending the seats they won in 2008 , when Barack Obama won the presidency in a landslide amid the massive economic crisis that capped off George W. Bush 's horrendously unpopular presidency . They 're also defending the House in a midterm three years after they gerrymandered themselves a durable majority . Under the circumstances , even a bad GOP strategy will probably yield significant gains in the Senate and retention of the House . If Republicans manage to flip the Senate it wo n't really matter whether it was a consequence of boring fundamentals rather than a wise political strategy . They 'll treat it as a vindication of anti-ACA absolutism anyhow . And so it 's hard to escape the suspicion that the GOP 's advantages this cycle explain its midterm strategy rather than the other way around .\nStill , it really is unusual for a party to put all their chips in one basket like this , so early in the cycle . And that 's a story unto itself .\nAhead of the 2006 midterms , Congressional Democrats outlined a fairly broad and thorough agenda and vowed to advance them through the House within the first 100 working hours of their majority in the event that they won . When they did win , then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi definitely let Bush be The Story for the next two years . But she also moved a bunch of items that lacked GOP support through the House to establish a Democratic agenda ( including familiar items like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , the Employee Free Choice Act , and two different State Children 's Health Insurance Plan expansions , both of which President Bush decided to veto ) . Moreover she managed to pass some actual laws , including two stimulus bills ( can you imagine if Obama requested a stimulus bill now ? ) and marshaled overwhelming Democratic support ( twice ) for the bill that ultimately authorized TARP when then-minority leader John Boehner could n't muster half his conference to support the bailout President Bush demanded .\nThis year 's Republicans are n't capable of anything similar .
