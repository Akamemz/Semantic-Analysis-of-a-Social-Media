Washington state has two dueling gun measures at the ballot box on Nov. 4. If both win, it likely will tie up the issue in court.\n\nInitiative 594 calls for a comprehensive tightening of the state's background check policies -- requiring background checks for virtually all purchases, including online and gun-show sales.\n\nOpponents, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), have been vastly outspent as the campaign heads into the last week.

Right now, hunters can use a range of tactics to kill their quarry -- from trapping and chasing them down with dogs, to baiting them with sweets, like jelly doughnuts. All three methods would be banned if Question 1 passes. Maine hunters would have to stalk and shoot bears the old-fashioned way, which is more humane, proponents say. Critics say it would balloon Maine's bear population.\n\nBoth sides have spent some $1.6 million on TV ads to persuade the public.\n\nAbortion\n\nThree state measures would challenge some abortions. In Colorado, voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to define the fetus as a person under the criminal code. In North Dakota, voters weigh the question of whether the state constitution should protect the rights of the unborn. In Tennessee, a measure would make it easier for the state to pass restrictions on abortion.\n\nDrug-testing docs and malpractice\n\nIn California, voters will decide whether to require doctors to submit to drug-testing, the first such policy in the country. Proposition 46 also would raise the cap on pain-and-suffering awards. Proponents say it would be a win for patients, while critics say it all amounts to a grab by tort lawyers.\n\nSentencing reform\n\nPrison over-crowded California is weighing Prop 47, which would dramatically change how the state treats certain \"nonserious, nonviolent\" drug and property crimes, by downgrading them from felonies to misdemeanors.\n\nThe measure also would allow those currently serving time for such offenses to apply for a reduced sentence, as long as they have no prior convictions for more serious crimes like murder, attempted murder or sexual offenses.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nSeveral states are asking voters to decide minimum wage increases.

Arkansas and Nebraska also have similar measures on the ballot. Illinois is asking voters about the minimum wage, but the result is non-binding.",
