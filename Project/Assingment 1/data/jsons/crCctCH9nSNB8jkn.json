Mr. Kelly \u2019 s remarks , she said , invoked a sense of pity for those who have not served in the military , but were dangerous because they did not seem to place value on other forms of public service .\n\u201c On the one hand , he spoke with enormous moral clarity about the horrible burden Gold Star families experience and how that burden is very far removed from most Americans when we have such a small volunteer force , \u201d Ms. Schake said . \u201c At the same time , he did widen the civilian-military gap . \u201d",
