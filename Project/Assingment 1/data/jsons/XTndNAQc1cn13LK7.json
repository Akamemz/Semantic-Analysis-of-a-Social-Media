Large metropolitan areas have stronger job growth and contribute more to GDP than small towns and rural areas . Urban residents have better health outcomes and life expectancy . Yet people are more reluctant to move to another town , state , or region . In particular , urban and rural residents are increasingly distrustful of one another . Popular culture is one channel through which Americans might develop negative expectations of other places . Small town residents whose experience of cities is based on Law and Order and The Wire could be forgiven for believing that large cities are crime-ridden drug havens . Sitcoms like Everyone Loves Raymond could give city-dwellers the impression that suburban demographics and lifestyles haven \u2019 t evolved much since Leave it to Beaver .\nIn this blog , I examine how the geography of TV has changed over time . Analyzing a sample of 135 scripted TV shows that aired between 1950 and 2017 , I document shifts across urban-suburban-rural locations and across regions of the country . [ i ]\nTV writers like real cities , fictional small towns , and outer space .\nSlightly under half of scripted TV shows that aired between 1950 and today are set in central city locations ( Table 1 ) . Roughly similar numbers of shows are set in suburban locations ( i.e . within metropolitan areas , but not in central cities ) and in small towns or rural areas . A handful of shows take place in both urban and suburban locations , often with \u201c home \u201d scenes set in the suburbs and \u201c work \u201d scenes set in the city ( i.e . Mad Men , Dick Van Dyke Show , I Love Lucy ) . About 15 percent take place in locations without a clear urban status , include non-U.S. settings ( i.e . M * A * S * H ) , outer space ( i.e . Star Trek ) , unspecified locations ( i.e . Lost , Gilligan \u2019 s Island ) , or shows with no fixed location ( i.e . Alfred Hitchcock Presents , Twilight Zone ) .\nAlmost all urban shows and about 78 percent of suburban shows are set in real , identifiable U.S. metropolitan areas . By contrast , more than half of small town and rural shows are set in fictional locations , including older programs such as the Andy Griffith Show and Petticoat Junction , as well as more contemporary shows like Friday Night Lights and Parks and Recreation . Nearly all small town or rural shows with real settings are Westerns ( Gunsmoke , Deadwood , Bonanza ) . About 45 percent of shows with indeterminate urban status also have fictional locations . This category includes many science fiction or fantasy shows , for which settings often have no real equivalent ( i.e . outer space ) .\nCities have become more popular on TV . The South has not .\nTV shows have become consistently more urban over time , while the popularity of suburban and small town settings has fluctuated ( Figure 1 ) . In the 1950s and 1960s , fewer than 30 percent of shows were set in central cities . These included crime dramas such as Dragnet and Perry Mason , superhero shows like Superman and Batman , and comedies such as the Honeymooners . The urban share increased to about half in the 1970s and 1980s , then to around 60 percent by the 2000s . Suburban shows occupied about one-quarter of TV real estate from the 1960s through the 1990s . Over one-third of shows in 1950 were set in small towns or rural areas , mostly Westerns and comedies . The rural/small town share declined steadily through the 2000s , but made a comeback in the 2010s , with shows such as Justified .\nWhile the urban status has changed substantially , the geographic representation by region has remained fairly consistent over time . In every decade , more shows have been set in the Northeast and West census regions than their overall population shares ( Figure 2 ) . About 15 percent of TV shows have been set in both New York City and Los Angeles , although each city contained on average four percent of the country \u2019 s population over this time period . Slightly fewer shows have been set in the Midwest than its population share , while the South has represented a much smaller share of TV shows ( 15 percent ) than population ( 33 percent ) . The South \u2019 s share of scripted TV shows has grown only slightly since the 1950s , while population share has increased substantially . Moreover , 40 percent of Southern TV shows were set in the Baltimore or Washington , D.C. metropolitan areas , which are part of the South geographically but culturally more aligned with the Northeast .
