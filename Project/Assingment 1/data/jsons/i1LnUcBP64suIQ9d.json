Trump did not define its values in the long term , even if he might temporarily defile them . \u201c We \u2019 re the party of the \u2018 open door , \u2019 \u201d Priebus told me , as he often does . Not big , beautiful walls .\nFor a while this spring , it seemed possible to contain the earthquake . Trump showed flickering signs of \u201c maturing \u201d as a candidate , and Republicans seemed willing to \u201c support the nominee , \u201d if not endorse him . The \u201c normalization \u201d of Donald Trump became a media watchword , the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise . Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio , Lindsey Graham , Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer ( in Rubio \u2019 s case ) deriding him as a \u201c fraud , \u201d \u201c con man \u201d and \u201c lunatic \u201d or ( in Graham \u2019 s ) a \u201c race-baiting , xenophobic , religious bigot \u201d or ( in Jindal \u2019 s ) a \u201c madman who must be stopped \u201d or ( in Perry \u2019 s ) a \u201c barking carnival act. \u201d I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries . Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that . \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians , \u201d he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry . In an interview , I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years . His smirk was audible over the phone . \u201c Well , I \u2019 m not referring to any politicians in particular , but I \u2019 ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Politicians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal . But they are not as tough . \u201d\nPriebus , meanwhile , kept working the phones , trying to coax anti-Trump Republicans back to the party line and persuade \u2014 beg \u2014 Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on . \u201c I have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn \u2019 t think are deserving of grace , \u201d Priebus said . Trump , in turn , calls Priebus \u201c Mr . Switzerland \u201d and speaks well of him . \u201c Reince is a peacemaker , a very good person for getting people together , \u201d he said .
