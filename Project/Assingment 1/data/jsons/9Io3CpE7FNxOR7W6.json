    "content": "In the secretive special operations community , officials are debating whether to tweak tactics for daring and risky missions involving hostage rescue and terrorist targeting that have been compromised by years of detailed news accounts and Hollywood portrayals .\nSome believe Islamic extremists have gone to school on special operations forces . The classroom is the U.S. media .\nSpecial operations forces \u2019 three most recent attempts to rescue American hostages failed . Last year , SEALs attempted a beach insertion to capture a terrorist leader in Somalia but were spotted and repelled . There was also the horrific loss of SEALs in a helicopter shoot-down that some family members believe was an ambush .\nFor years , the basics for rescue and terrorist targeting have remained intact : insertion by silenced helicopter or boat to , or near , a target ; and fast-roping or running to the end point . The objective is complete tactical surprise by the best commandos in the world , enhanced by goggles that let them see through the darkness .\nBut as one veteran of the special operations community said , \u201c We \u2019 ve got one way of doing things , and the enemy is on to it because they \u2019 ve published these news reports and movies and all the rest of it . It \u2019 s time for some new tactics because the old ones are not working anymore . \u201d\nRetired Rear Adm. George Worthington , once the Navy \u2019 s top SEAL , was asked whether members of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have gone to school on special operations tactics .\n\u201c Movies , \u201d he said . \u201c All they need to do is get the movies . \u201d\nIt was a reference to Hollywood \u2019 s realistic depiction of counterterrorism operations , especially the hunt for Osama bin Laden .\nKenneth McGraw , a spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa , Florida , said , \u201c USSOCOM has a robust lessons learned program and SOF units are constantly reviewing the results of operations to determine if changes need to be made to training , doctrine , or tactics , techniques and procedures . \u201d\nThe May 2011 SEAL Team 6 raid that killed bin Laden attracted an unprecedented spotlight to how hostage rescues and targeted insertions are conducted .\nIn the immediate aftermath , the White House leaked copious timelines . The CIA helped Hollywood make a movie . A former SEAL on the raid wrote a detailed book .\nNavy SEALs and the Army \u2019 s crack hostage rescuers , Delta Force , had conducted scores of similar raids against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Iraq , but the details remained \u201c black. \u201d No post-operation leaks or readouts surfaced .\nThe most recent failure happened Dec. 5 in Yemen \u2019 s southern Shabwa region . A mission to rescue American photojournalist Luke Somers failed the previous month . When commandos arrived at an al Qaeda cave hideout , Somers had been moved .\nThe same terrorist modus operandi occurred this summer in Syria . When Delta Force operatives arrived at the Islamic State compound , the hostages had been transferred .\nIslamists clearly have learned the abilities of U.S. intelligence and commandos . Perhaps they also have learned the practice of Hezbollah terrorists in Beirut in the 1980s when prisoners did not stay in one place for long .\nLast year , SEAL Team 6 raiders were forced to retreat after a lookout for the al Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab spotted them around a compound in Somalia holding its military commander \u2014 the mission \u2019 s target .\nOn Dec. 5 , nearly 40 SEAL Team 6 members did not attempt an overhead insertion , as was conducted at bin Laden \u2019 s compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . Instead , they touched down about 6 miles away in two Ospreys , which fly as fixed-wing aircraft and land and take off vertically like a helicopter .\nThen , dumb luck , or an alert guard , intervened . As the special operations team approached 100 yards away , the guard picked that time to go outside .\n\u201c He was just outside the compound , \u201d the special operations community source said . \u201c When they take a piss , they kneel down . They \u2019 re Muslims , and they don \u2019 t stand erect like we do . He was down kind of flat-footed , pissing , behind a bush and saw these guys coming and he yelled . He was unarmed , but he yelled to the guys inside and then ran in . \u201d\nFighters from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula quickly shot and killed Somers and a South African hostage , Pierre Korkie . Minutes later , the SEAL team engaged and killed most of those in the compound . The mission failed , but all SEALs returned to base safely .\nSaid the source , \u201c There \u2019 s no good answer to this issue except we \u2019 ve kind of relied on one technique . That \u2019 s helicopter insertion and then either coming right down on top of target or way off and then walking the last 4 or 5 miles . Millions have been spent on silencing them and keeping them stealthy . And cooling off the exhaust so they don \u2019 t give off a thermal signature . You wouldn \u2019 t believe the programs they spend money on to try to do those things . \u201d\nSEAL Team 6 used specially configured MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to penetrate Pakistani airspace in the bin Laden raid and arrived over the compound undetected .\nAs for changing tactics , Adm. Worthington said he was \u201c not sure how you go about doing that . \u201d\n\u201c You have to get someplace , \u201d he said . \u201c There \u2019 s several ways to do it . Sea . Air . Land , if you will . Every operation is a different one . It \u2019 s an equal-opportunity battlefield . They get to shoot back . They see the \u2018 ops \u2019 go bad on them , they figure out how to fix it . \u201d\nOne person who warned early on that Islamic terrorists would go to school on leaked tactics is former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates . He ran the Pentagon the night bin Laden was killed .\nIn his memoir , \u201c Duty , \u201d Mr. Gates said that on that May 2011 night he warned the White House not to gab about details .\n\u201c I reminded everyone that the techniques , tactics , and procedures the SEALs had used in the Bin Laden operation were used every night in Afghanistan and elsewhere in hunting down terrorists and other enemies , \u201d he wrote . \u201c It was therefore essential that we agree not to release any operational details of the raid . That we killed him , I said , is all we needed to say . Everybody in that room agreed to keep mum on details .\n\u201c That commitment lasted about five hours . The initial leaks came from the White House and CIA . They just couldn \u2019 t wait to brag and to claim credit . \u201d\nMr. Gates became so enraged that he used an expletive to convey to Mr. Obama \u2019 s national security director the need to shut up \u2014 to no avail .\nA tragedy befell SEAL Team 6 later that year . A CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down while on a mission to back up Army Rangers in Afghanistan . All 38 onboard , including 15 SEAL Team 6 members , were killed .\nThe families of some of the dead believe the mission was compromised by Afghan informants . The Taliban fighter who fired the deadly rocket-propelled grenade was stationed on a dwelling \u2019 s turret not far from the landing zone , which the U.S. had not used before .\nA Pentagon official told Congress there was no evidence the shooter was tipped off .\nLarry Johnson , a former CIA hand and counterterrorism official at the State Department , said hostage rescue headquarters is now the White House and no longer an interagency process .\n\u201c We \u2019 re more incompetent , \u201d Mr. Johnson said . \u201c The entire national security apparatus for dealing with hostage incidents and kidnapping has basically been dismantled under Obama . It \u2019 s all being done over at the White House . And instead of bringing in people who have genuine experience in this area , it \u2019 s all being played from the standpoint of domestic politics . \u201d\nMr. Johnson noted that an international aid group said it was close to obtaining Korkie \u2019 s release and had discussed the negotiations with unidentified Americans in Yemen . The White House and State Department said they were unaware .\nThe Pentagon said the Dec. 5 mission was quickly drawn up and approved by President Obama in response to intelligence that al Qaeda planned to kill Somers the next day .",
