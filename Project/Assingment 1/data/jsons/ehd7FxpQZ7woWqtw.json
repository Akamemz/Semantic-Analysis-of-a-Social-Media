The move , however , caused rioting by ethnic Russians and triggered a wave of Russian cyberattacks .\nEstonians are well aware of Moscow \u2019 s attempts to manipulate and deceive them . As Soviet citizens , they were subjected to everything from TV broadcasts full of propaganda to more covert shenanigans : Estonians have a museum in an upscale hotel in Tallinn that shows , among other things , how the KGB famously embedded listening devices in plates at the hotel restaurant .\n\u201c We have 60 years of experience in reading between the lines and speaking between the lines , \u201d says T\u00f5nu Tammer , head of the computer emergency response team at the Estonian Information System Authority . \u201c It \u2019 s actually our dear adversaries that keep those skills honed for the younger generation . \u201d\nSocial media and the internet have opened new ways for Russia to infiltrate networks and disseminate disinformation with vastly more speed and scope . U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed a Russian cyberespionage team for penetrating the computer networks of the Democratic National Committee in the run-up to the 2016 American presidential election . Later , Russian hackers gained access to thousands of private emails of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman , John Podesta . More broadly , U.S. investigators have found evidence of Russian intrusion in election systems in all 50 states , even though voting seemed to be largely unaffected in most areas .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff KGB surveillance artifacts are displayed in the Hotel Viru in Tallinn , Estonia . The Soviet-built hotel , the only place foreigners were allowed to stay during the Soviet era , was heavily bugged by the KGB .\nRussia is also the prime suspect behind one of the costliest cyberattacks , NotPetya , which targeted Ukraine in 2017 and then spread to 64 countries , causing an estimated $ 10 billion in damage .\nEstonia , however , was virtually untouched by this attack . Across society \u2013 from Mr. Padar \u2019 s volunteer Cyber Defense League to grandparents being taught to use more complicated passwords \u2013 the country has honed a robust civilian and government network to protect the young democracy against foreign intrusion .\nIt has also helped bolster its neighbors , in part because of an idea for joint cyber exercises hatched in one of Mr. Priisalu \u2019 s sauna sessions with a couple of Swedes .\nSeveral years after 9/11 , when Estonia joined NATO , it proposed hosting a NATO center of excellence for cyberdefense . The initial response from other members : Cyber ? We \u2019 re in the middle of helping to fight a war in Afghanistan . Plus , there was doubt that tiny Estonia could be of much help . But after the 2007 attacks , NATO agreed to back the initiative .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff \u201c Do we lack people and resources ? Yes . We \u2019 re a country of 1.3 million people . [ But ] 2007 made people realize that it is important and maybe [ Estonians ] know what they \u2019 re doing. \u201d \u2013 Col. Jaak Tarien , who oversees a NATO cyberdefense center in Tallinn\n\u201c Do we lack people and resources ? Yes . We \u2019 re a country of 1.3 million people , \u201d says Col. Jaak Tarien , who today oversees the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence ( CCDCOE ) in Tallinn . But , he says , \u201c 2007 made people realize that it is important and maybe [ Estonians ] know what they \u2019 re doing . \u201d\nToday the CCDCOE hosts the largest live-fire cyberdefense exercise in the world . Known as Locked Shields , the annual drill draws more than 1,200 participants from nearly 30 countries .\nLast April , the scenario involved a coordinated series of cyberattacks during a national election , seeking to manipulate how the public perceived the election results , and also affecting vital services . The exercise provided strategic decision-makers and technical experts the opportunity to learn to work more closely in a time of crisis .\nAlthough Estonia itself hasn \u2019 t faced a major attack on its voting system , it has been vigilant in defending its electoral machinery . The government offers free cybersecurity screenings for political parties and trains candidates how to recognize and avoid breaches . Estonian security specialists try to break into the country \u2019 s voting system about a year ahead of elections . Any vulnerabilities that are discovered are reported to the public , along with what \u2019 s being done to fix them . Thanks in part to the heightened trust such transparency affords , more than 40 % of Estonians now vote online .\nThat \u2019 s made possible by a system created in the 1990s , which gives each citizen a unique digital identification . A smart ID card with a chip , together with personal identification numbers , acts as a double authentication system that has enabled Estonia to offer nearly all government services online . New parents can order birth certificates from their laptops or access their children \u2019 s school system , parties can sign contracts , and patients \u2019 medical prescriptions are issued electronically .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff The Old Town section of Tallinn , Estonia \u2013 parts of which date back to the 13th century \u2013 is one of the best-preserved medieval sites in Europe .\nWhen a security lapse was discovered in the country \u2019 s digital ID card system , the \u201c nerd reserves \u201d were brought in to help , demonstrating the practical assistance that goes along with their efforts to raise awareness among citizens and officials alike . \u201c It \u2019 s very important that we not only don \u2019 t scare them ... we must also offer solutions , \u201d says Mr. Padar .\nTo bolster the country \u2019 s electronic security , the nerd reserves stage exercises similar to the NATO cyberdefense center \u2019 s . In one drill , members of the government \u2019 s Cabinet confronted a Chernobyl-like disaster . They were told that sensors along the eastern border with Russia flashed readings showing a rapid rise in nuclear radiation , ostensibly due to a Russian nuclear plant malfunction . Unknown to the participants , however , there was no radiation . Instead , a cyberattack had relayed the false readings .\n\u201c The purpose was to create ... a mess and the government need to think through what to do , \u201d says Mr. Padar .\nAt one point during the exercise , cameras that were allowing outside observers to watch the Cabinet members \u2019 response were shut off by the government security service . Was that part of the drill or because officials didn \u2019 t want details of the exercise to get out ? \u201c I can \u2019 t tell you more , \u201d says Mr. Priisalu , cryptically .\nIn December 2018 , a story circulated on Russian social media with the hashtag # ESTexitEU . It purported to show someone beating up an ethnic Russian in the Estonian capital . The attack supposedly took place in a district of Tallinn called Lasnam\u00e4e , where ethnic Russians makeup nearly two-thirds of the 118,000 residents .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Soviet-era housing is a common sight in the Tallinn neighborhood of Lasnam\u00e4e . About 26 % of the population of Estonia is ethnic Russian .\nThe implication was clear : The Russian-speaking minority in Estonia isn \u2019 t safe .\nBut a propaganda watchdog group called Propastop found the posts suspicious . One volunteer , who didn \u2019 t want to be named for security reasons , sat on his couch night after night after his children had gone to bed to track down the story \u2019 s origins . Through his and other people \u2019 s efforts , Propastop revealed that there was more snow in the photo than there had been on the ground the day of the alleged beating \u2013 implying the location or the date , or both , were fabricated . Propastop and investigative journalists Holger Roonemaa and Martin Laine also found that the people running the accounts on Facebook and Vkontakte , a popular social media site in Russia , were using fake names and profile photos . Presented with this evidence , Facebook shut down numerous accounts by mid-January . But the Vkontakte groups are still open .\nThis is another way the Russians try to meddle , not only in Estonia but in the U.S. as well : spreading disinformation . In fact , America is likely even more vulnerable to this type of manipulation than cyberattacks , and it \u2019 s an area where Estonians \u2013 who lived for decades under Soviet occupation \u2013 may have the most to teach Americans .\nIn the U.S. , Russia has sought to exploit ideological divisions between Democrats and Republicans , liberals and conservatives , inciting heated conversations on Twitter or Facebook from a troll factory in St. Petersburg . The trolls focus on hot-button issues , such as immigration or racism , the latter of which constituted some two-thirds of fake Russian account activity around the 2016 election . They performed their dark arts not so much through the blunt instrument of propaganda , as in Soviet days , but much more subtly through fake social media accounts that often appeared sympathetic to popular causes , such as Black Lives Matter .\nIn Estonia , by contrast , Russia seeks to exploit ethnic divisions . But the tactics are the same \u2013 trying to divide from within . In 2014 , after Russia annexed Crimea \u2013 an area of Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority \u2013 many outsiders looked at Estonia \u2019 s eastern flank with its high concentration of ethnic Russians and wondered if it would be next .\nCHRISTA CASE BRYANT/THE \u2588\u2588\u2588 Ivan Polynin , a native Russian who moved to the eastern Estonian city of Narva in 2016 , encountered strong support for Russian President Vladimir Putin among the many ethnic Russians who live here . They listen to and are influenced by Russian state TV broadcasts .\nBut Sven Sakkov , director of the International Center for Defense and Security ( ICDS ) in Tallinn , says Estonia is not easy prey for Russian propaganda .\n\u201c For us , Russian information campaigns , information warfare , influence operations , fake news is not something that just happened in 2014 , \u201d he says , noting that because of its long history with such interference , the country is now \u201c quite well inoculated . \u201d\nThere is one possible exception , though : Lasnam\u00e4e . Dmitri Teperik , who studies national resilience in the face of hostile foreign influence activities at ICDS , estimates that while only 7 % to 9 % of Estonian society could be destabilized on ethnic or linguistic grounds , it \u2019 s enough to create trouble .\n\u201c Even small groups can dictate some general or major shifts in society , especially if these minor groups are backed or supported by foreign actors , \u201d says Mr. Teperik , a Russian-speaking Estonian who co-founded a nongovernmental organization designed to increase ethnic Russians \u2019 enlistment in the military . \u201c The gunpowder is definitely here . What we are missing , fortunately , is the spark . \u201d\nIn 2018 , Estonia \u2019 s Government Office started a strategic communications team , which monitors the three main Russian TV channels as well as online media , and last year hosted an inaugural media literacy week . Students in Estonian-speaking high schools all take a required 35-hour media and manipulation class . Strategic communication adviser Siim Kumpas says that efforts are underway to extend the class to Russian-language schools as well .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Merle Maigre of CybExer , an Estonian cybersecurity firm , says Estonian \u2019 s model is not plug-and-play but offers a comprehensive approach to preparing for attacks that others can emulate .\nThe State Electoral Office is also involved , running a working group that meets daily during election campaigns to monitor media and identify any attempts to influence elections through disinformation .\nIn a media climate with several Russian-language outlets that are considered propaganda machines , Estonia has allowed them to continue to operate , but has refused to give their reporters access to certain government events and high-level officials . Estonian authorities would also like to see social media platforms better regulate political ads .\n\u201c If citizens don \u2019 t know who is whispering in their ear , then you don \u2019 t have a genuine political discussion but you have this post-modernist hodgepodge of yelling out loud , \u201d says Ms. Past , the government \u2019 s chief national cyberrisk officer . \u201c Ever since the late 18th century , we have put all our effort into building a society that is better than that , \u201d she says , referring to Western democracies .\nThe question still looms : To what extent are these efforts applicable to the U.S. ? Some , such as implementing a unified education curriculum similar to Estonia \u2019 s , with its media and manipulation class , wouldn \u2019 t be easy . It would require the buy-in of 50 states and thousands of local school boards , says Bret Schafer , social media analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund in Washington , who has visited Estonia twice .\nSimilarly , protecting election machinery against cyberattacks the way Estonians do would be difficult . Estonia has one unified State Electoral Office . The U.S. puts decisions about voting machines and methods in the hands of thousands of state and local officials . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure our country \u2019 s model can immediately be imported , \u201d says Merle Maigre , executive vice president of government relations at CybExer , an Estonian cybersecurity firm .\nYet there is plenty the U.S. can draw from Estonia \u2019 s model . Ms. Kaljurand says Estonia learned three key lessons from 2007 that can be applied to countries of any size : putting the topic high on the political agenda , establishing a clear division of responsibilities , and creating a multistakeholder model of security that involves not only the government but also the private sector , academia , and civil society .\nThe U.S. has taken important steps in this direction , classifying election systems as critical infrastructure , improving coordination between various government agencies , and better supporting state and local election officials . But it has no overarching national strategy to counter foreign influence , despite various agencies tackling different aspects of the issue , according to a 2019 report by the Homeland Security Advisory Council . Mr. Schafer notes that there is no strategic communications group like the one Mr. Kumpas is part of and \u201c that \u2019 s a huge problem . \u201d\nStill , Estonia is proof that such alertness can come from the people themselves . As a youth growing up in Soviet times , Mr. Padar \u2013 like many other young people \u2013 was influenced by the ubiquitous propaganda designed to produce good Soviet citizens . He yearned to become a soldier and defend the great homeland . But in high school , he started thinking more for himself , and found another way to serve \u2013 first as a police officer , and now as commander of the Cyber Defense League .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

The Soviet-built hotel, the only place foreigners were allowed to stay during the Soviet era, was heavily bugged by the KGB.\n\nRussia is also the prime suspect behind one of the costliest cyberattacks, NotPetya, which targeted Ukraine in 2017 and then spread to 64 countries, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage.\n\nEstonia, however, was virtually untouched by this attack. Across society \u2013 from Mr. Padar\u2019s volunteer Cyber Defense League to grandparents being taught to use more complicated passwords \u2013 the country has honed a robust civilian and government network to protect the young democracy against foreign intrusion.\n\nIt has also helped bolster its neighbors, in part because of an idea for joint cyber exercises hatched in one of Mr. Priisalu\u2019s sauna sessions with a couple of Swedes.\n\nSeveral years after 9/11, when Estonia joined NATO, it proposed hosting a NATO center of excellence for cyberdefense. The initial response from other members: Cyber? We\u2019re in the middle of helping to fight a war in Afghanistan. Plus, there was doubt that tiny Estonia could be of much help. But after the 2007 attacks, NATO agreed to back the initiative.\n\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff \u201cDo we lack people and resources? Yes. We\u2019re a country of 1.3 million people. [But] 2007 made people realize that it is important and maybe [Estonians] know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d \u2013 Col. Jaak Tarien, who oversees a NATO cyberdefense center in Tallinn\n\n\u201cDo we lack people and resources? Yes. We\u2019re a country of 1.3 million people,\u201d says Col. Jaak Tarien, who today oversees the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn. But, he says, \u201c2007 made people realize that it is important and maybe [Estonians] know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nToday the CCDCOE hosts the largest live-fire cyberdefense exercise in the world. Known as Locked Shields, the annual drill draws more than 1,200 participants from nearly 30 countries.\n\nLast April, the scenario involved a coordinated series of cyberattacks during a national election, seeking to manipulate how the public perceived the election results, and also affecting vital services. The exercise provided strategic decision-makers and technical experts the opportunity to learn to work more closely in a time of crisis.\n\nAlthough Estonia itself hasn\u2019t faced a major attack on its voting system, it has been vigilant in defending its electoral machinery. The government offers free cybersecurity screenings for political parties and trains candidates how to recognize and avoid breaches. Estonian security specialists try to break into the country\u2019s voting system about a year ahead of elections. Any vulnerabilities that are discovered are reported to the public, along with what\u2019s being done to fix them. Thanks in part to the heightened trust such transparency affords, more than 40% of Estonians now vote online.\n\nThat\u2019s made possible by a system created in the 1990s, which gives each citizen a unique digital identification. A smart ID card with a chip, together with personal identification numbers, acts as a double authentication system that has enabled Estonia to offer nearly all government services online. New parents can order birth certificates from their laptops or access their children\u2019s school system, parties can sign contracts, and patients\u2019 medical prescriptions are issued electronically.\n\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff The Old Town section of Tallinn, Estonia \u2013 parts of which date back to the 13th century \u2013 is one of the best-preserved medieval sites in Europe.\n\nWhen a security lapse was discovered in the country\u2019s digital ID card system, the \u201cnerd reserves\u201d were brought in to help, demonstrating the practical assistance that goes along with their efforts to raise awareness among citizens and officials alike. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we not only don\u2019t scare them ... we must also offer solutions,\u201d says Mr. Padar.\n\nTo bolster the country\u2019s electronic security, the nerd reserves stage exercises similar to the NATO cyberdefense center\u2019s. In one drill, members of the government\u2019s Cabinet confronted a Chernobyl-like disaster. They were told that sensors along the eastern border with Russia flashed readings showing a rapid rise in nuclear radiation, ostensibly due to a Russian nuclear plant malfunction. Unknown to the participants, however, there was no radiation. Instead, a cyberattack had relayed the false readings.\n\n\u201cThe purpose was to create ... a mess and the government need to think through what to do,\u201d says Mr. Padar.\n\nAt one point during the exercise, cameras that were allowing outside observers to watch the Cabinet members\u2019 response were shut off by the government security service. Was that part of the drill or because officials didn\u2019t want details of the exercise to get out? \u201cI can\u2019t tell you more,\u201d says Mr. Priisalu, cryptically.\n\nIn December 2018, a story circulated on Russian social media with the hashtag #ESTexitEU. It purported to show someone beating up an ethnic Russian in the Estonian capital. The attack supposedly took place in a district of Tallinn called Lasnam\u00e4e, where ethnic Russians makeup nearly two-thirds of the 118,000 residents.\n\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Soviet-era housing is a common sight in the Tallinn neighborhood of Lasnam\u00e4e. About 26% of the population of Estonia is ethnic Russian.\n\nThe implication was clear: The Russian-speaking minority in Estonia isn\u2019t safe.\n\nBut a propaganda watchdog group called Propastop found the posts suspicious. One volunteer, who didn\u2019t want to be named for security reasons, sat on his couch night after night after his children had gone to bed to track down the story\u2019s origins. Through his and other people\u2019s efforts, Propastop revealed that there was more snow in the photo than there had been on the ground the day of the alleged beating \u2013 implying the location or the date, or both, were fabricated. Propastop and investigative journalists Holger Roonemaa and Martin Laine also found that the people running the accounts on Facebook and Vkontakte, a popular social media site in Russia, were using fake names and profile photos. Presented with this evidence, Facebook shut down numerous accounts by mid-January. But the Vkontakte groups are still open.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything, just observe,\u201d says the volunteer.\n\nThis is another way the Russians try to meddle, not only in Estonia but in the U.S. as well: spreading disinformation. In fact, America is likely even more vulnerable to this type of manipulation than cyberattacks, and it\u2019s an area where Estonians \u2013 who lived for decades under Soviet occupation \u2013 may have the most to teach Americans.\n\nIn the U.S., Russia has sought to exploit ideological divisions between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, inciting heated conversations on Twitter or Facebook from a troll factory in St. Petersburg. The trolls focus on hot-button issues, such as immigration or racism, the latter of which constituted some two-thirds of fake Russian account activity around the 2016 election. They performed their dark arts not so much through the blunt instrument of propaganda, as in Soviet days, but much more subtly through fake social media accounts that often appeared sympathetic to popular causes, such as Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn Estonia, by contrast, Russia seeks to exploit ethnic divisions. But the tactics are the same \u2013 trying to divide from within. In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea \u2013 an area of Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority \u2013 many outsiders looked at Estonia\u2019s eastern flank with its high concentration of ethnic Russians and wondered if it would be next.\n\nCHRISTA CASE BRYANT/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Ivan Polynin, a native Russian who moved to the eastern Estonian city of Narva in 2016, encountered strong support for Russian President Vladimir Putin among the many ethnic Russians who live here. They listen to and are influenced by Russian state TV broadcasts.\n\nBut Sven Sakkov, director of the International Center for Defense and Security (ICDS) in Tallinn, says Estonia is not easy prey for Russian propaganda.\n\n\u201cFor us, Russian information campaigns, information warfare, influence operations, fake news is not something that just happened in 2014,\u201d he says, noting that because of its long history with such interference, the country is now \u201cquite well inoculated.\u201d\n\nThere is one possible exception, though: Lasnam\u00e4e. Dmitri Teperik, who studies national resilience in the face of hostile foreign influence activities at ICDS, estimates that while only 7% to 9% of Estonian society could be destabilized on ethnic or linguistic grounds, it\u2019s enough to create trouble.\n\n\u201cEven small groups can dictate some general or major shifts in society, especially if these minor groups are backed or supported by foreign actors,\u201d says Mr. Teperik, a Russian-speaking Estonian who co-founded a nongovernmental organization designed to increase ethnic Russians\u2019 enlistment in the military. \u201cThe gunpowder is definitely here. What we are missing, fortunately, is the spark.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Estonia\u2019s Government Office started a strategic communications team, which monitors the three main Russian TV channels as well as online media, and last year hosted an inaugural media literacy week. Students in Estonian-speaking high schools all take a required 35-hour media and manipulation class. Strategic communication adviser Siim Kumpas says that efforts are underway to extend the class to Russian-language schools as well.\n\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff Merle Maigre of CybExer, an Estonian cybersecurity firm, says Estonian\u2019s model is not plug-and-play but offers a comprehensive approach to preparing for attacks that others can emulate.\n\nThe State Electoral Office is also involved, running a working group that meets daily during election campaigns to monitor media and identify any attempts to influence elections through disinformation.\n\nIn a media climate with several Russian-language outlets that are considered propaganda machines, Estonia has allowed them to continue to operate, but has refused to give their reporters access to certain government events and high-level officials. Estonian authorities would also like to see social media platforms better regulate political ads.\n\n\u201cIf citizens don\u2019t know who is whispering in their ear, then you don\u2019t have a genuine political discussion but you have this post-modernist hodgepodge of yelling out loud,\u201d says Ms. Past, the government\u2019s chief national cyberrisk officer. \u201cEver since the late 18th century, we have put all our effort into building a society that is better than that,\u201d she says, referring to Western democracies.\n\nThe question still looms: To what extent are these efforts applicable to the U.S.? Some, such as implementing a unified education curriculum similar to Estonia\u2019s, with its media and manipulation class, wouldn\u2019t be easy. It would require the buy-in of 50 states and thousands of local school boards, says Bret Schafer, social media analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, who has visited Estonia twice.\n\nSimilarly, protecting election machinery against cyberattacks the way Estonians do would be difficult. Estonia has one unified State Electoral Office. The U.S. puts decisions about voting machines and methods in the hands of thousands of state and local officials. \u201cI\u2019m not sure our country\u2019s model can immediately be imported,\u201d says Merle Maigre, executive vice president of government relations at CybExer, an Estonian cybersecurity firm.\n\nYet there is plenty the U.S. can draw from Estonia\u2019s model. Ms. Kaljurand says Estonia learned three key lessons from 2007 that can be applied to countries of any size: putting the topic high on the political agenda, establishing a clear division of responsibilities, and creating a multistakeholder model of security that involves not only the government but also the private sector, academia, and civil society.\n\nThe U.S. has taken important steps in this direction, classifying election systems as critical infrastructure, improving coordination between various government agencies, and better supporting state and local election officials. But it has no overarching national strategy to counter foreign influence, despite various agencies tackling different aspects of the issue, according to a 2019 report by the Homeland Security Advisory Council. Mr. Schafer notes that there is no strategic communications group like the one Mr. Kumpas is part of and \u201cthat\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d\n\nStill, Estonia is proof that such alertness can come from the people themselves. As a youth growing up in Soviet times, Mr. Padar \u2013 like many other young people \u2013 was influenced by the ubiquitous propaganda designed to produce good Soviet citizens. He yearned to become a soldier and defend the great homeland. But in high school, he started thinking more for himself, and found another way to serve \u2013 first as a police officer, and now as commander of the Cyber Defense League.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
