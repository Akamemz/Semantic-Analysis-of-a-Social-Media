And they certainly don \u2019 t trust the Iranians . So the White House is asking them instead to put their faith in science .\nThe White House is rolling more of its science-driven message this week in its ongoing bid to stop Congress from moving to block the deal . The idea is to convince Congress and the public that , hey , the scientists think this is a good deal , so they should too .\nSome hard-liners will never accept the deal , White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in an interview on Friday . \u201c But for every other member of Congress \u2014 presumably including some Republicans \u2014 that is attempting to evaluate this deal on the merits , I would anticipate that scientific data would be persuasive for them . \u201d\nAhead of the data onslaught , the \u201c don \u2019 t just take our word for it \u201d approach was evident in the immediate aftermath of the deal .\n\u201c If you speak to analysts and objective folks who have studied these issues , studied the technical details , the science , the energy , I think that they feel very comfortable with this deal , \u201d said White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz , speaking to reporters on Friday . Obama warned negotiators , Schultz added , that \u201c he would not accept a deal unless he was reassured by the scientists that this would end Iran \u2019 s pathway to a nuclear weapon .

By restricting future research and development , the administration hopes to avoid a situation where Iran suddenly has a much lower breakout time as soon as the provisions lift .\nMoniz said that limits on Iran \u2019 s \u201c R & D program for next-generation centrifuges \u201d would mean the country \u2019 s scientists couldn \u2019 t work behind the scenes to reduce the breakout time .\nBut the pitfalls of the science strategy were evident during Moniz \u2019 s appearance on CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on Sunday : Physics is not exactly a hot-button issue .\nWhen asked why the Iranians are saying sanctions will be lifted immediately while the United States says they \u2019 ll be phased out , Moniz gamely tried to change the subject to centrifuges before addressing the question directly .

He \u2019 s been calling key lawmakers , including Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and sponsor of a bill that would let Congress block the deal .
