    "content": "The 2020 presidential election just got its first notable third-party challenger . Last Tuesday , Michigan Rep. Justin Amash , who left the Republican Party nine months ago and became an independent , announced he would run for president as a Libertarian . And while we won \u2019 t know whether Amash wins his new party \u2019 s nomination until later this month , here \u2019 s what we do know about third-party candidacies more broadly and what that could mean for President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in the general election .\nFirst , it \u2019 s unlikely Amash wins much of the vote in November . Take what happened in 2016 . Third-party candidates won 6 percent of the vote , which was the largest share of the vote since Ross Perot ran for a second time in 1996 , but it was still just 6 percent . As you can see in the chart below , third-party candidates don \u2019 t tend to win that much support . Our system just isn \u2019 t set up for successful third-party presidential bids .\nHowever , that doesn \u2019 t mean Amash ( or other third-party contenders ) won \u2019 t matter in November . In this era of close elections , small shifts in the margins can matter a great deal to the final result , and third-party contenders can play a part in that . Amash \u2019 s candidacy , in particular , could affect the margins in some key battleground states , including his home state of Michigan , which was pivotal to Trump \u2019 s victory four years ago . Consider what happened in 2016 : In 11 states , Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson \u2019 s raw vote total exceeded the vote margin separating Trump and Hillary Clinton . Now , that doesn \u2019 t mean Johnson necessarily changed who won in each of those states , but he and other third-party contenders ( like Jill Stein of the Green Party ) may have helped shape the outcome , especially in the three states that proved decisive in the Electoral College : Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .\nSo who might Amash \u2019 s candidacy hurt more in 2020 \u2014 Biden or Trump ? This is a hard question to answer , but there are some reasons as to why an Amash bid might hurt Trump more than Biden . Estimates vary for how many Americans are \u201c libertarian \u201d \u2014 perhaps anywhere from 4 percent to 22 percent of the public \u2014 though most voters back one of the two major parties , so we \u2019 re not talking about a huge portion of the electorate . That said , there is evidence that more libertarian-minded voters are more likely to vote Republican than Democratic , which could cost Trump at the ballot box .\nWhat \u2019 s more , a relatively high-profile Libertarian nominee like Amash could be more successful in attracting some GOP-leaning voters away from Trump . This group might include the small slice of conservative and/or Republican voters \u2014 including some \u201c Never Trumpers \u201d \u2014 who may be uncomfortable with Trump or even dislike the president . These voters in particular might like Amash because of his conservative record , support for limited government and long-standing opposition to Trump \u2014 for instance , he was the only non-Democrat to vote for Trump \u2019 s impeachment in the House .\nStill , an Amash bid could still present problems for Biden , too . If 2020 is a referendum election on Trump \u2019 s presidency , Biden may not want another well-known candidate in the race to give potential anti-Trump voters a different choice . Polls have long shown that a majority of voters prefer an alternative candidate to Trump , but that doesn \u2019 t mean that alternative has to be Biden . So it \u2019 s possible that Amash could win over some of these voters , lowering Biden \u2019 s ceiling and narrowing the race between the major-party nominees . Trump seems to have adopted this view , responding to Amash \u2019 s announcement by egging on the congressman and comparing him to Stein , who some on the left think spoiled the election for Clinton in 2016 .\nAnd looking at the Electoral College , Amash \u2019 s impact could be most deeply felt in Michigan , where he could actually win enough votes to influence the outcome . We would expect Amash to win a larger share of the vote in his home state , considering Johnson did his best in 2016 in New Mexico , where he \u2019 d been a two-term GOP governor , winning 9 percent of the vote . Amash , unlike Johnson , hasn \u2019 t held a statewide office , but he probably would still have an advantage in the western part of Michigan , which he \u2019 s represented in the House for nearly 10 years . That could get in the way of Democrats \u2019 hopes of making gains in traditionally Republican Kent County \u2014 Amash \u2019 s base and home to Grand Rapids \u2014 because of its sizable share of college-educated voters . While Biden has led most early Michigan polls , Amash could complicate the race there .\nBut it \u2019 s also possible that 2020 might just not be that good of an environment for third-party candidates . One reason for this comes down to a familiar feature of American politics : partisan polarization . Take 2016 . On the one hand , it probably should have been a better year for third-party candidates , as political science research shows that third-party support is often strongest when partisans dislike their parties \u2019 nominees but don \u2019 t want to cross over and vote for the other major party . But as we saw in 2016 , two historically unpopular nominees weren \u2019 t enough to dampen support among partisan voters and create a meaningful movement around an alternative . And some of this may be due to negative partisanship \u2014 or voters staying fully loyal to their party rather than casting a protest vote because they loathe the idea of the other party winning more .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that there just isn \u2019 t enough overlap between the two parties in 2020 . The parties are ideologically distinct and very attuned to their activists on cultural and social issues as well as economic ones , meaning there is less opportunity for a third-party candidate to make a dent in the electorate . For instance , one reason Perot emerged in the 1990s as such a strong alternative is both Republicans and Democrats were still struggling over the role economic and identity issues would play in their respective parties , with Republicans split between traditional ( George H.W . Bush ) and culturally conservative ( Pat Buchanan ) camps . Democrats were also split , searching for their ideological identity after 12 years out of the White House , ultimately turning to the center with the nomination of Bill Clinton . These are the kinds of conditions that often make a third-party bid successful , but they also require some fluidity in the party system that might not be there today .\nUltimately , the evidence is mixed about whether an Amash run on the Libertarian ticket would make much of an impact on the general election outcome . And it remains to be seen whether Amash has the potential to become the next Perot , or whether his candidacy will look more like that of Johnson or Ralph Nader . One thing shared across many of these third-party bids is this , though : They didn \u2019 t go well for the incumbent party in the White House .\nWhy switching to vote-by-mail is tougher than it seems | \u2588\u2588\u2588",
