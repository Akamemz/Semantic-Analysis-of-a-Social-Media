    "content_original": "At 93, Jimmy Carter is cutting loose.\n\nThe former president sat down with The New York Times recently and chatted about all kinds of subjects. The Times decided to play up the fact that Carter \u2014 one of the worst presidents in U.S. history \u2014 would love to go over to North Korea as an envoy.\n\nBut the Times is steadily proving how out of touch it is, and how it no longer seems to actually \u201cget\u201d what real news is.\n\nHere are some major highlights from the interview:\n\n1. The Russians didn\u2019t steal the 2016 election.\n\nCarter was asked \u201cDid the Russians purloin the election from Hillary?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes \u2014 or any votes,\u201d Carter said.\n\nSo the hard-left former president doesn\u2019t think the Russians stole the election? Take note, Capitol Hill Democrats.\n\n2. We didn\u2019t vote for Hillary.\n\nCarter and his wife, Roselyn, disagreed on the Russia question. In the interview, she \u201clooked over archly [and said] \u2018They obviously did'\u201d purloin the election.\n\n\u201cRosie and I have a difference of opinion on that,\u201d Carter said.\n\nRosalynn then said, \u201cThe drip-drip-drip about Hillary.\u201d\n\nWhich prompted Carter to note that during the primary, they didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe voted for Sanders.\u201d\n\n3. Obama fell far short of his promises.\n\nBarack Obama whooshed into office on pledges of delivering \u201chope and change\u201d to the country, spilt by partisan politics.\n\nHe didn\u2019t. In fact, he made it worse.\n\n\u201cHe made some very wonderful statements, in my opinion, when he first got in office, and then he reneged on that,\u201d he said about Obama\u2019s action on the Middle East.\n\n4. Media \u201charder on Trump than any president.\u201d\n\nA recent Harvard study showed that 93% of new coverage about President Trump is negative.\n\nBut here\u2019s another shocker: Carter defended Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I\u2019ve known about,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.\u201d\n\n5. NFL players should \u201cstand during the American anthem.\u201d\n\nCarter, who joined the other four living ex-presidents on Saturday for a hurricane fundraiser, put his hand on his heart when the national anthem played \u2014 and he has a strong opinion about what NFL players should do, too.\n\n\u201cI think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate,\u201d he said. \u201d I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem.\u201d",
