    "content": "Until the 1960s , North Carolina oversaw and funded segregated schools ( and hospital wings , and movie theater sections , and cemeteries ) for its Native population , the funding for the Indian schools coming from the minuscule coffers of the state \u2019 s Department of Negro Education . This included a school for the Lumbee called the Indian Normal School of Robeson County , currently known as the University of North Carolina at Pembroke . These were not quite boarding schools in the vein of the infamous Carlisle Indian School ( which aimed to erase Indigenous identities ) : In many of these schools , the Native kids were allowed to be themselves and to be taught by teachers who came from their communities .\nWhen many of these schools were shut down to comply with the federal diktats of the Civil Rights Era , the Native children were herded into similarly under-funded public school alongside their white counterparts . This was where the real assimilative efforts began . Despite Native kids learning alongside white children , the history books , from the late 1960s to present day , never managed to catch up to the fact that Native people are in fact still alive and present and thriving . And so , for many , the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre ( more often framed as the Battle of Wounded Knee ) was the final piece of Native history imparted by their public school education .\nOne of the defining political aspects of the Lumbee Tribe is the fact that they have not been recognized by the federal government , meaning they are not allowed full access to federal Indian Country programs .
