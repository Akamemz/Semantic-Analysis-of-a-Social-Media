In so doing , Johnson became the 16th woman to accuse the president of groping , kissing , or assaulting her . At least seven additional women have accused Trump of sexual harassment .\nBeyond the slew of accusations , Trump was infamously recorded bragging about groping women on a hot mic .

On Thursday afternoon , Trump tweeted out doctored footage of Joe Biden that \u2019 s meant to mock the former vice president for a video he shared the day before .

And it \u2019 s not just the president . During a Fox News interview last Sunday , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said video of Biden \u2019 s \u201c creepy \u201d behavior would be \u201c a big problem \u201d for him if he ran for president , completely ignoring the fact that her boss has been accused of far worse .\n. @ KellyannePolls on @ JoeBiden : If anybody just types in \u201c Creepy Uncle Joe Videos \u201d you come up with a treasure trove\u2026I think Joe Biden has a big problem here because he calls it affection and handshakes , his party calls it completely inappropriate . pic.twitter.com/MKbbw2mUIC \u2014 FoxNewsSunday ( @ FoxNewsSunday ) March 31 , 2019\nNone of this is meant to defend Biden . The video he posted on Wednesday stops short of apologizing for his behavior , and his line that \u201c [ s ] ocial norms are changing \u201d obfuscates the fact that at least two women \u2014 Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos \u2014 accused him of conduct they say was inappropriate at the time , not just in hindsight .
