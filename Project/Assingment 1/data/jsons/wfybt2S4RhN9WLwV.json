    "content": "President Barack Obama 's decision to cancel a planned Moscow summit with President Vladimir Putin next month was brought on by a wide spectrum of US frustrations with Russia , not least of which was its decision to grant temporary asylum to fugitive ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden .\nBut another issue , one that 's just beginning to come into public focus , may carry the long-term potential to do far more damage to Mr. Putin 's and Russia 's already deteriorating image in the West .\nThat is the widespread impression , based on a new Russian law that bans `` homosexual propaganda , '' that Putin 's Russia is drifting out of the modern world altogether . The new law clearly suggests the Kremlin is trying to engineer a conformist `` majoritarian '' society in which minorities \u2013 especially the country 's beleaguered LGBT community \u2013 may exist only in private and will be severely punished for any attempt to assert their identity in the public square .\nThe law , which is backed by the powerful Russian Orthodox Church , does not explicitly ban homosexuality , but looks more like the US military 's former `` Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell '' rule applied to the whole of Russian society . Supporters say gay people should be allowed to live their own lives out of public sight , but must not be permitted to speak about their `` non-traditional '' orientation or display it in any venue where it might be witnessed by minors which , in the Internet age , is just about any non-private space .\n`` Russia 's public development is taking the right path , '' says Fr . Vsevolod Chaplin , a leading spokesman for the Orthodox Church . `` This law gives us a chance to preserve the purity of childhood , and to oppose the artificial sexualization of children . I hope that other countries will follow Russia 's lead , because the normalization of homosexuality is wrong . ''\nReaction in the US has been gathering steam in recent weeks , including an appeal \u2013 probably misdirected \u2013 to boycott Russian vodka , which has seen many taverns around the world take the iconic Russian beverage off their shelves . Some protesters have demonstratively dumped bottles of the stuff into the streets .\nBut most worrisome by far to the Kremlin is a growing call for the US and Western countries to boycott the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympics , a move that would humiliate and isolate Russia like no other , and could eviscerate the personal prestige of the Games ' chief promoter , Vladimir Putin . Following Mr. Obama 's decision to shun a summit meeting with Putin , the political stage appears to be set for a major effort by global LGBT groups and their supporters to step up efforts to achieve exactly that .\nBoth Western misconceptions about the Russian law , as well as the view that Russia is completely out-of-step with the world on the issue of gay rights , are on full display in the exchange about Russia between Obama and Jay Leno on Tuesday 's edition of NBC 's Tonight Show .\n`` Something that shocked me about Russia , and I 'm surprised that this is not a huge story , homosexuality is against the law , '' Mr. Leno says , comparing the situation to Nazi Germany . `` I mean , it starts with that . You round up people .... Why is not more of the world outraged about this ? ''\nObama responded by saying he has `` no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them .... I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work and I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics , we wouldn \u2019 t tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently .

And a petition posted on the White House website that calls for denying US visas to the Russian law's main authors, Duma deputies Yelena Mizulina and Vitaly Milonov, has aims to gather the 100,000 signatures required to put it on the president's agenda.
