    "content": "It was a fall day in 2014 , and my classroom was full of excitement . My students had transformed themselves into historical figures for a living history project . I was going to broadcast it online so other schools could watch our \u201c Age of Exploration News Conference \u201d live .\nOne half of the class researched and dressed up as European explorers like Christopher Columbus . The other half acted as news reporters from all the major outlets ready with questions . It was my attempt to bring history to life .\nAndy stepped to the mic . Several classes from across America were watching live online . It must have felt like millions of people to a fifth-grader .\nAndy was acting as Ferdinand Magellan , the first person traditionally credited with circumnavigating the globe . He stood up tall and leaned into the mic ready to face the media .\n\u201c Are there any questions ? \u201d Andy , as Ferdinand Magellan , asked the group of energized 10-year-old \u201c reporters. \u201d One quickly got his attention with a loud request .\n\u201c Yes , what are you famous for and when did you do much of your exploration ? \u201d asked one of my student reporters .\n\u201c Well , I am famous for sailing around the world in 1972 . \u201d\nThe class started to laugh . To Andy \u2019 s credit , he bounced back from the laughter and the clear embarrassment he felt and finished his news conference strong .\nI pulled Andy aside later and asked where he had found the information .\nHe had been researching online and felt so confident that his answer was accurate . I felt horrible . I had let him down by not teaching him how to test the reliability of a source .\nThe need to teach students how to vet information is only more urgent now , in the age of `` fake news . '' A recent study showed that on social media , fake news , defined as deliberately falsified news articles created to drive clicks , was shared over 35 million times during our most recent election cycle .\nI \u2019 ve spent 23 years teaching in a Southern California classroom , and we \u2019 re seeing a true bubble of false information online . Here 's how I 've adapted my curriculum and teaching style to make sure my students know which sources to trust \u2014 and which to reject .\nI was determined to change the way I help my students critically analyze the information they were finding on the internet\nTo make sure I wouldn \u2019 t have any student in the same situation as Andy ever again , I started asking my students to examine seven different elements of a news article . If the information checks out on each of these points , it has a high likelihood of being accurate . Still , passing the test is not a guarantee that it \u2019 s fact .\nThe only problem was that I hadn \u2019 t developed a way for them to put their new knowledge to the test . Sure , I could give a traditional test , but knowing the large amount of testing my class already has to do , I wasn \u2019 t willing to add another to their lives .\nI had recently started a grassroots effort with a few other educators focused on infusing play back into the lives of children . The program is called Global School Play Day . As a big believer in the concept of \u201c play to learn , \u201d I wanted to put my students in a situation that allowed them to play with the fake news , and even create some themselves to understand how easy it is to share .\nI shifted again with the most recent election cycle to a classroom game\nI needed my students to understand that \u201c fake news \u201d is news that is being reported as accurate , but lacks reliability and credibility . A good example are the widely shared stories of the pope endorsing one presidential candidate over another . I decided to devise a game , the goal being to tell fake news from real news .\nThe first place I went to is world renowned for their creation of fake news : the Onion . I knew it would be a simple jumping-off point for finding things my students could research to see if it was fake or true .\nWe then used a great site for kids called Newsela.com , which takes articles from multiple sources and makes them accessible to a variety of reading abilities . This would serve as the real news website . From there , I explained the rules of the game we would play . Then the game was on !\nImagine a Simon Says style game where I present an article found on the web on a projector . Students research for two to three minutes , then respond by standing or staying seated to signal if they believe the article is true or fake . My students absolutely loved the game . Some refused to go to recess until I gave them another chance to figure out the next article I had queued .\nSimon Says for fake news seemed to hook the kids in , but I wanted to provide a deeper opportunity for understanding so the concept would really stick . The popular gameshow To Tell The Truth was a bit before my time , but I had seen enough to understand the idea . On the show , three people would speak to a panel of celebrity experts who would try to figure out who was telling the truth about their identity . The panel of experts was given a chance to do their own research by asking questions . I took the main concept of that show , gave it a twist , and have now landed on our own version .\nThe Simon Says-style game has morphed now so that we can challenge other classes . Each class has three students on camera using Skype , then reads three news stories . Only one is fake . Students work in teams to see if they can be the first to prove which of the three is the \u201c fake news. \u201d Classes trade turns between sharing the stories and identifying the fake news .\nWhat started out as an in-class learning game has shifted to an online game with classes from anywhere across the United States .\nFrom \u201c Is this true , Mr. Bedley ? \u201d to \u201c This Is true , Mr. Bedley ! \u201d\nThe kids really enjoyed the fake news stories . It gave them something to laugh , talk , and debate about . But the game has also led to a class discussion on whether we should support sources that share fake news . There were several references to the tabloid magazines sold near the checkout register in the grocery store . Ultimately , my students expressed the importance of being able to identify which news is fake and how this content can be used to manipulate them and their decisions .\nThe challenge for my students comes back to understanding the difference between someone who is sharing their opinion and someone who is creating news that is meant to mislead , either as clickbait or to influence those who don \u2019 t take the time to verify accuracy . We talk about how facts can be verified , whereas opinions typically can be supported with evidence , but are far more debatable and take a position within the debate . Now that my students have a greater understanding of fake news , our new game for the end of the year will be \u201c Fake or Opinion \u201d instead of \u201c Fact or Opinion . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s interesting what you overhear as a teacher . We hear a lot , and this election cycle had more of my 10- and 11-year-old students talking politics with each other than any other year I \u2019 ve taught during a presidential election cycle . Through those conversations , I could hear fear , confusion , and misunderstandings . It was one of the reasons I needed to encourage my students to read and learn more on their own , which turned me back to the question of how they identify misinformation and fake news and ultimately to the learning game I created for them .\nI set out to help my students read news more critically , and I feel that these games have shifted the way my students approach online content every day .

If the information checks out on each of these points, it has a high likelihood of being accurate. Still, passing the test is not a guarantee that it\u2019s fact.\n\nCopyright: I always ask students to check the bottom of the webpage to see if the information has been submitted for ownership. Verification with multiple sources: Students must double check the information on a few different web pages. Like in a trial, the more corroborating witnesses, the more likely the truth will be discovered. Credibility of source, such as between History.com versus a random unknown source: I tell them to check if the source has been recently created. Sources that have been around for a while can show reliability over time and be tested by hindsight, whereas recently created sources don\u2019t carry much of a track record. Date published: I always ask them to check how recently the page was updated to see how current the information is and whether anything has changed. Author's expertise and background with the subject: Students should check if the author is someone who has dedicated time and effort to learning this subject. For example, a university professor typically has increased credibility versus a hobbyist. Does it match your prior knowledge: I ask them if the information matches up with what they have learned before Does it seem realistic: I tell students to use their common sense. Does something seem authentic or probable?\n\nThe only problem was that I hadn\u2019t developed a way for them to put their new knowledge to the test. Sure, I could give a traditional test, but knowing the large amount of testing my class already has to do, I wasn\u2019t willing to add another to their lives.\n\nI had recently started a grassroots effort with a few other educators focused on infusing play back into the lives of children.
