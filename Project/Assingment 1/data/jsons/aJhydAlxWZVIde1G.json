    "content": "HANOI , Vietnam \u2014 This time around , President Trump faces higher expectations .\nEight months after his breakthrough meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un , Mr. Trump this week heads into the second denuclearization summit under greater scrutiny to bring back more tangible results from the high-stakes parley in Vietnam .\nSome analysts expect an agreement that would require North Korea to freeze its production of fissile material at its Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center , used to make nuclear weapons . It \u2019 s not clear what Mr. Trump is willing to give in return .\nTheir first meeting in Singapore produced vague promises from Mr. Kim to abandon his weapons programs , but there has been scant progress on that front since then despite months of follow-up talks between the two sides .\nThe U.S. \u201c didn \u2019 t really get anything out of that Singapore summit , just an aspirational statement , \u201d said Sue Mi Terry , a former CIA analyst and chair of the Korea program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . \u201c You can argue that not much has really changed . \u201d\nBruce Klingner , a specialist on Korea at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said recent North Korean public statements \u201c indicate the two sides are no closer to even having a common definition of denuclearization , let alone a comprehensive detailed agreement . \u201d\nBut former CIA officer Andrew Kim , who helped negotiate last year \u2019 s breakthrough meeting , said he expects more progress from the second summit .\n\u201c The stars kind of have lined up , \u201d he said in a speech Friday . \u201c I have come to believe we have a great opportunity to engage with Pyongyang . \u201d\nWhen the president sits down with Mr. Kim for two days of talks starting Wednesday in Hanoi , he will try to pin down the reclusive communist autocrat on his definition of \u201c denuclearization . \u201d\nTo U.S. officials , it means complete , verifiable and irreversible elimination of Pyongyang \u2019 s weapons programs . But a senior administration official acknowledged that one of the goals sought by the White House at the second summit is \u201c developing a shared understanding of what denuclearization is . \u201d\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union \u201d Sunday that North Korea is still a nuclear threat , although \u201c tensions are reduced . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got work to do on the denuclearization , \u201d Mr. Pompeo said . \u201c There are many things [ Mr. Kim ] could do to demonstrate his commitment to denuclearization . \u201d\nHe said Mr. Trump is focused on \u201c a demonstrable , verifiable step \u201d from North Korea .\nFormer Ambassador Joseph DeTrani , who served as special U.S. envoy to six-party talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006 , said the most important objective is \u201c clarity on the nuclear issue . \u201d\n\u201c I think at this summit , North Korea has to hear that again \u2014 that the U.S. is resolute , \u201d Mr. DeTrani said . \u201c And does North Korea agree with that ? What is their definition of complete denuclearization ? Describe it any way you want , but now you know clearly where we are . There \u2019 s no ambiguity on the U.S. side . \u201d\nSpeaking of the need for clarity , security analysts say the White House has been sending mixed messages about its goals for the summit . Mr. Trump said last week he feels no urgency to make a deal with Mr. Kim , pointing out that sanctions are still in force and that North Korea hasn \u2019 t conducted a nuclear or missile test in well over a year .\n\u201c I \u2019 m in no rush , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c There \u2019 s no [ weapons ] testing . As long as there is no testing , I \u2019 m in no rush . \u201d\nThe administration \u2019 s announcement that it is seeking a \u201c shared understanding \u201d of denuclearization with North Korea seems at odds with comments by U.S. special envoy Stephen Biegun last month .\nIn a speech , Mr. Biegun said North Korea has committed \u201c to the dismantlement and destruction \u201d of all its uranium- and plutonium-enrichment facilities . He said the pledge goes beyond the Yongbyon nuclear plant .\nLowering expectations even more , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that simply sitting down for a second summit is an achievement .\n\u201c The fact [ that the president ] is able to do it again is in itself a big success , \u201d she said .\nBut having broken the ice last year with the first-ever meeting between a U.S. president and North Korean leader , the world now expects more from the relationship .\nWithout mentioning the possible easing of sanctions , the White House is promising unspecified economic benefits if Mr. Kim is willing to commit to a more firm plan for denuclearization .\n\u201c The president has made clear that should North Korea follow through on its commitment to complete denuclearization , we will work to ensure there are economic development options , \u201d the White House said .\nRichard Johnson , senior director for fuel cycle and verification at the Nuclear Threat Initiative , said a freeze on producing enriched uranium and plutonium is \u201c a starting point . \u201d\n\u201c This is not going to happen in a year , this is not going to happen in two years , \u201d Mr. Johnson said . \u201c The essential next step is a fissile material production freeze . \u201d\nA senior administration official expressed frustration that news coverage of the lack of progress with North Korea is \u201c completely divorced from policy . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that the North Koreans are advancing their weapons of mass destruction program despite our diplomacy , \u201d the official said . \u201c Our diplomacy is precisely because of what the North Koreans are doing , and this is why the president has placed such a high priority on convincing the North Koreans to make a different set of choices . \u201d\nWhile the U.S. is approaching the summit with firm expectations , Mr. DeTrani said the North Koreans are looking for room to maneuver around sanctions .
