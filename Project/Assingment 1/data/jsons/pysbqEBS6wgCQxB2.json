It reminds of a time when the nation was truly an of, by and for the people system of governance, when elected officials gave proper respect to the citizens who pay their salaries, when Founding Fathers\u2019 ideals and visions, as encapsulated in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, weren\u2019t so readily placed on the chopping block, moved aside for progressive principles \u2014 diced and chipped for holier-than-thou intellectualism and elitist politicking.\n\nIt shows that Spicer, in the eyes of the political world, could easily have dismissed, denied and blamed outward, but instead, chose humility.
