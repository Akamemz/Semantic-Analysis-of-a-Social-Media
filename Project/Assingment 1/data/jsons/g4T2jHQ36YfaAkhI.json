It \u2019 s also a symbol of how the president thinks about free enterprise . Free enterprise to the president means taking money from the taxpayers and giving it freely to his friends . \u201d\n-- Mitt Romney at a campaign appearance outside of failed California solar-panel maker Solyndra .\nPresident Obama has been preparing supporters for weeks about a couple of serious setbacks to his re-election hopes that may come this month : a slackening economy and a possible defeat for his health law at the Supreme Court .\nJustices could this month deliver a stinging blow to the president if they were to strike down the central tenant of Obama \u2019 s 2010 health law : a requirement that all Americans purchase private health insurance or be enrolled in a government program .\nThis would be particularly bad because without this provision , the law would urgently need to be revisited and reassert itself as a campaign issue . Obama has so far mostly focused on attacking his rival , Mitt Romney , and urging the nation \u201c forward. \u201d Obama has only raised the health law as an issue when looking to solidify his base , and then only on narrow principles , not the history-making entitlement it created .\nJustices later this month will render their decision on the law , and whatever they decide , it will change the trajectory of the race . The health law is the incumbent \u2019 s single-greatest liability . It led to the Democratic disaster of 2010 and still galls many independent voters for its size and the slipshod manner in which it was crafted . Mostly , though , it is so disliked because it represented a distraction from the more urgent work of righting the economy .\nEvery time Obama and his advisers said he was making a hard pivot to jobs in 2010 and 2011 , it was an implicit admission that his attention had been elsewhere . Not good . That the \u201c hard pivot \u201d consisted mostly of campaign speeches denouncing congressional Republicans didn \u2019 t help much either .\nThat \u2019 s why today \u2019 s unemployment numbers are such bad news for the president . The re-litigation of Obama \u2019 s central achievement as president will come just as Americans are buckling up for another dip in the road to recovery .\nThe May jobs numbers are dire . The total unemployment rate jumped to 14.8 percent from 14.5 percent in April . The narrow measure of those unemployed but still looking for work ticked up from 8.1 percent to 8.2 percent . That means that not only did the workforce shrink as discouraged workers dropped out , but that there was a net loss of jobs .\nThat means that even before the really rough stuff began in Europe , the U.S. job market was already in decline . The downward revision of April \u2019 s overall economic measure ( do they ever revise up ? ) shows that the problems in the U.S. economy are very real .\nThe economy only added 115,000 jobs in March , just treading water , but causing the real unemployment rate to rise as folks fled the job market . That number was revised this morning to 77,000 jobs , meaning that the contraction had already begun . We were sinking , not treading water two months ago .\nThe May number of 69,000 jobs added is a sharpening of the trend . The president today will still technically able to say that the economy has added jobs for dozens of months in a row , but it won \u2019 t really be true .\nBoth April and May saw too few jobs added to keep up with population growth , meaning that we have been running a jobs deficit .\nThat brings us to the other history-making act of the Obama era : the 2009 stimulus that ladled out more than $ 787 billion in a bid to revive the economy , then in free-fall . Romney has a tricky time talking about Obama \u2019 s health law , given his own state-level plan in Massachusetts , but he sure loves to talk about the stimulus .\nAmericans largely believe that the stimulus was either bad for the economy or ineffective and with four years of deficits above $ 1 trillion , expensive and ineffective is not a good place to be . As this downturn continues or accelerates , watch for Romney to sharpen his attacks on Obama \u2019 s rescue effort and to let others pick up on the subject of the health law .\nThis is the third June in a row that has brought unhappy economic news for a president hoping to show progress on the economy .
