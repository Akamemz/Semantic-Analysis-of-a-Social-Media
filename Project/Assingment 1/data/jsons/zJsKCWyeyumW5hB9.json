Finally over the weekend , just days before Tuesday \u2019 s New Hampshire primary , Ms. DaSilva got to see the rumpled septuagenarian in the flesh at a raucous rally at her school \u2019 s fieldhouse .\n\u201c Bernie speaks the truth , and everything he says he believes in now he believed in 30 years ago , \u201d says DaSilva , a psychology major wearing a bright blue \u201c Students for Bernie \u201d T-shirt .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure . I \u2019 ve always been , ' I wouldn \u2019 t vote Republican , ' but it depends , \u201d she says . \u201c I have one Republican in mind who I \u2019 d probably vote for : Marco Rubio . He just kind of seems like the most realistic out of them . \u201d\nSuch a response is a dagger to the heart of the Clinton campaign . Not only are they counting on young voters to turn out for them in November \u2013 including those who go for Sanders in the primary \u2013 they are counting in particular on young women to be inspired by the prospect of the first woman president .\nDemocratic voters like DaSilva are the exception . When push comes to shove , most say they \u2019 ll vote for their party \u2019 s nominee come November . But the lack of enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton by many young Democrats could present a profound challenge for the former secretary of State .\nDespite her big loss to Sanders among voters under age 30 in last week \u2019 s Iowa Democratic caucuses \u2013 84 percent to 14 percent \u2013 and an expected loss Tuesday in New Hampshire , Clinton is still favored in national polls to win her party \u2019 s nomination . Where she loses among the young , she wins big among older Democratic voters , especially women . And she \u2019 ll need all the ground troops she can muster to get out the vote in what is expected to be a closely fought general election . Young voters , a key part of the Democratic base , were critical to Barack Obama \u2019 s victories in 2008 and 2012 , both in turnout and in volunteering .\n\u201c Senator Sanders has eroded Hillary Clinton \u2019 s appeal to the idealist , sometimes unrealistic , change-oriented young who want to challenge the established order and with it , politics-as-usual , \u201d writes Kathleen Hall Jamieson , director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , in an e-mail .\n\u201c He 's accomplished this by successfully associating the Clinton campaign 's fundraising from large donors , her speaking fees , and her advocacy of nuanced Wall Street reform with corruptive power arrangements that advantage the \u2018 upper 1 percent . \u2019 \u201d\nHistorically , young voters have been a particularly tricky bunch , not known for being loyal voters . Today , the so-called Millennials , those under age 35 , have little trust in the pillars of society , including the government , Wall Street , and the media , according to a survey released last April by the Harvard Institute of Politics . So for a candidate like Clinton , a Washington \u201c insider \u201d for decades , tapping into youthful idealism has been a stretch \u2013 especially with the idealistic Sanders on the scene .\nThe spread of social media also has been a boon to the top outsiders in the 2016 race , Sanders and Donald Trump .\n\u201c There is a common level of frustration , and anger , and so I think that they have captured the first digital response to political activism , \u201d says Andrew Card , president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge , speaking of the Sanders-Trump phenomenon . \u201c They \u2019 re able to speak with very little filter . \u201d\nIndeed , young Democratic voters talk about Facebook feeds that are \u201c on fire \u201d with the debate over Sanders vs. Clinton . Shawn Bond , a college student from Louisville , Ky. , who is volunteering for Clinton in New Hampshire , says his Facebook feed is mostly Clinton-oriented , though he \u2019 s been \u201c unfriended \u201d by a couple of Sanders supporters .\n\u201c Having an argument on social media is fruitless , but on Facebook it \u2019 s all there , \u201d says Mr . Bond , a student at American University in Washington , taking part in a canvassing event Saturday at Clinton \u2019 s Concord , N.H. , office . \u201c So it \u2019 s very easy for a post to be hijacked by someone who doesn \u2019 t believe the same things I do . \u201d\nBond says in his work for Clinton , he asks his peers to look at who \u2019 s more capable of \u201c getting things done . \u201d\n\u201c That was a big reason why I picked Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders , \u201d he says . \u201c There was a time when I had this existential crisis , and I felt like my friends were supporting Bernie Sanders , and I was supposed to be supporting Bernie Sanders . But once I gave the candidates a real look , it became very clear that one has always been a fighter , one has a record of getting things done . \u201d\nOne challenge for Clinton , which stems from the social media phenomenon , is the challenge in correcting misimpressions . One Franklin Pierce student said she couldn \u2019 t support Clinton because she , Clinton , \u201c was not always pro-choice \u201d on abortion . Clinton , in fact , has a record of supporting abortion rights since she became a public figure .\n\u201c Bernie has always been pro-choice and always favored equal pay for equal work , \u201d says the student . \u201c He almost has more feminist ideals that she does . \u201d\nSome young women bristle at the notion that they should support Clinton because she \u2019 s a woman .\n\u201c I \u2019 m waiting for the day when I can vote for a woman president who I can completely support who \u2019 s not Hillary , \u201d says Emily Brisson , a social work student at Franklin Pierce . \u201c Being a woman is not a reason to cause me to want to vote for her . \u201d\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , a Clinton backer , may not have helped matters over the weekend when she asserted at a Clinton event here that \u201c there \u2019 s a special place in hell for women who don \u2019 t help each other ! \u201d\nStill , the frustration by older women over younger women who shrug at Clinton \u2019 s history-making potential is palpable .\n\u201c Generally , young women grew up with less discrimination , and didn \u2019 t have to go through the abortion battles , \u201d says Barbara Landwehr , a lawyer and Clinton supporter in Concord , N.H. \u201c Bernie is more exciting , and for some , she isn \u2019 t . \u201d\nSome observers also note a double standard in the words and actions a male candidate can take versus a woman candidate . At Franklin Pierce , Sanders at one point theatrically doffs his jacket and hands it to a student sitting behind him .\n\u201c I feel like a rock and roll star ! \u201d Sanders says to cheers . \u201c Nothing more is coming off , that \u2019 s it ! \u201d\nIt \u2019 s probably not something a serious female presidential candidate could say .\nSome Democrats plead for perspective over the hand-wringing at Clinton \u2019 s enthusiasm gap among young voters . Wait for the Republicans to settle on a nominee , and then get the word out on that person \u2019 s policy views .\n\u201c The choice is going to be very stark no matter who the [ Republican ] nominee is , \u201d says Democratic strategist Peter Fenn .\nHe notes , for example , that Senator Rubio does not allow for any exceptions on abortion , including cases of rape and incest .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
