Off to a good start is surely better than the alternative .\nThe question is whether there is any prospect of the new atmosphere having some genuine durability . For once , this observer thinks optimism is also realistic .\nGiven the poisonous climate of our political conversation , it is fair to demand an explanation of that position . Well , here it goes .\nAfter running for Vice President in 2012 , Paul Ryan took a step back . He revisited his assumptions about virtually everything under the sun . Ryan became as much an observer as a participant in the arena .

From that view , he had the chance to reflect carefully on the policies that he champions .\nIn April of 2014 , Ryan advanced \u201c The Path to Prosperity : A Responsible Balanced Budget. \u201d This budget would cut spending by $ 5.1 trillion over the next ten years . Not all pain and suffering , the budget constituted a blueprint to also grow the economy to achieve a balanced budget . Yes , this budget is conservative in nature . No , it is not rigid dogma or unfairly austere .\nThe Ryan budget centers itself on five pillars\u2014protecting the nation , expanding opportunity , strengthening the safety net , securing seniors \u2019 retirement , and restoring fairness . As was the case then , there is little doubt the particulars in that budget will be met with opposition from Democrats . That is to be expected , and it is fine .\nAnother , probably minor in the eyes of others , piece of legislation gives some clarity to how it is that Paul Ryan thinks . That legislation would be the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2015 .\nYes , government is already too big . That does not mean there is no need for government or that it can not be put to useful purposes .\nThe Ryan legislation creates a structure and process to \u201c make recommendations on how best to incorporate outcomes measurement , institutionalize randomized controlled trials , and rigorous impact analysis into program design . \u201d\nIn simple English , what this means is that Paul Ryan wants government to use actual facts and data when it comes to formulating policy rather than just making it up along the way . This careful and deliberative approach will serve him well in the coming days .\nPaul Ryan is a conservative in every respect of the term . His philosophy , his demeanor , and his words all convey a deep and abiding respect for the foundations that have made America great .\nHe has specifically stated to the House that it is his intention to return to \u201c regular order. \u201d This allows for one and all to participate in the lawmaking that is required to move the country forward .
