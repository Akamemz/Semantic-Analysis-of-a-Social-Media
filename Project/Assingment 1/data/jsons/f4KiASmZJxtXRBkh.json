    "content": "Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill are pushing to add climate change provisions to the third aid package for people and industries affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic .\nBut it \u2019 s unclear whether they have the political leverage to make those ideas stick\u2014at least not yet .\nSeveral Senate Democrats want airlines to reduce their carbon emissions in exchange for federal aid that could hit $ 50 billion or more .\nHouse Democrats , meanwhile , are looking at clean-tech tax credits . Those include incentives for electric vehicles , battery storage , offshore wind and solar energy that were left out of a December tax extenders package .\nTheir demands have precedent . In 2009 , when the Obama administration bailed out the auto industry to the tune of $ 80 billion , it conditioned aid on improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency .\nFor one thing , Democrats lack leverage with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House . For another , there \u2019 s broad consensus that Congress must act quickly to provide relief to affected Americans . Democrats don \u2019 t want to be seen as slowing down emergency aid with climate demands .\nThese political realities mean that Congress would be hard pressed to tackle both coronavirus and climate change in any near-term relief effort . But one political economist said that climate hawks should press for concessions in any future long-term economic package .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing discussed right now is phase three . That phase is still an immediate stopgap measure . It \u2019 s not looking at a long-term fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on track once workers can return to their jobs , \u201d said Mark Paul , a senior fellow at Data for Progress .\n\u201c I do think that we need to ensure that climate is front and center , \u201d Paul said . \u201c But I think it appropriately belongs in the longer-term fiscal stimulus package . \u201d\nDan Lashof , director of the World Resources Institute , was more blunt in his assessment .\n\u201c I think in this immediate third package , climate \u2019 s not gon na be the central concern , \u201d he said . \u201c But that doesn \u2019 t mean that it should be ignored . \u201d\nThe airline industry has requested more than $ 50 billion in federal aid\u2014more than three times the amount it received after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to back the airlines 100 % ; it \u2019 s not their fault , \u201d President Trump said at a White House press briefing earlier this week . \u201c We \u2019 re going to be backstopping the airlines ; we \u2019 re going to be helping them very much . \u201d\nBut several Senate Democrats yesterday demanded that any assistance for the airline and cruise ship industries come with strings attached , including requirements to reduce carbon emissions .\n\u201c Given the poor environmental records of some companies in these industries , we believe that any such financial assistance should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion , '' they wrote in a letter to House and Senate leadership .\n\u201c Given the large footprint of commercial aviation , requiring reductions in carbon emissions would represent a major step in curbing our nation \u2019 s greenhouse gas emissions , \u201d they added .\nSigning the missive were Sens . Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , Martin Heinrich of New Mexico , Tina Smith of Minnesota , Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut , Ed Markey of Massachusetts , Cory Booker of New Jersey , Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon .\nAviation currently accounts for around 2.5 % of global greenhouse gas emissions . But that percentage is expected to triple by midcentury as tourism and travel expand .\nThe letter does not specify how airlines should go about curbing their emissions\u2014whether it \u2019 s through investments in alternative fuels , fuel efficiency or carbon offsets . A Whitehouse spokeswoman declined to comment further .\nBut environmentalists are now echoing the senators \u2019 call , and they \u2019 re specifically urging improvements in fuel efficiency and investments in alternative fuels .\n\u201c In the past several years , several airlines have plowed a significant portion of their profits into stock buybacks rather than investments in a climate-friendly future of aviation , \u201d said Annie Petsonk , international counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund .\n\u201c So if they \u2019 re going to get this kind of cash , it \u2019 s important to have some climate strings attached to it , \u201d she said . \u201c They don \u2019 t just need to improve their fuel efficiency\u2014although that \u2019 s important , as well . We also need strong economic incentives for them to reduce emissions and spur innovation . \u201d\nBrad Schallert , deputy director of international climate cooperation at the World Wildlife Fund , said U.S. airlines have lagged behind their European counterparts when it comes to investing in alternative fuels such as biofuels . Democrats , he said , are in a position to help change that .\n\u201c They could condition some of the aid that \u2019 s being received\u2014the grants and the loans\u2014based on some commitment to make investments in alternative fuels , \u201d he said . \u201c So airlines could get more cash if they decided to support the green industries of the future . \u201d\nSchallert acknowledged that Congress faces pressure to act quickly to help American workers affected by the pandemic , and Democrats \u2019 climate demands could slow down negotiations . But he stressed that the two goals aren \u2019 t mutually exclusive .\n\u201c Policymaking can achieve multiple goals at once\u2014the environment doesn \u2019 t need to come at the cost of not supporting workers at the same time , \u201d he said . \u201c There are ways to do both . \u201d\nOn the other side of Capitol Hill , House Democrats are eyeing an assortment of clean energy tax credits that were left out of a year-end tax extenders package following opposition from the White House ( E & E Daily , Dec. 19 , 2019 ) .\nThe co-chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition confirmed their focus on the incentives in a statement to E & E News .\n\u201c We absolutely hope to see clean energy tax credits included in a larger stimulus package . Including these credits will help us address both the economic slow-down we are facing as a result of COVID-19 and the ongoing climate crisis , \u201d said Reps.

Investments in clean energy , clean air and resiliency do just that , \u201d Castor said . \u201c For example , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created jobs in clean energy , transit and weatherization that paid dividends for taxpayers and communities . \u201d\nLashof , of the World Resources Institute , said he supports including the clean energy tax breaks in the third coronavirus stimulus package because the pandemic has affected workers in the sector .\n\u201c There \u2019 s people who are employed in solar and wind and energy efficiency , and those jobs are affected , too , \u201d he said . \u201c So if we \u2019 re going to have things focused on a specific industry , it makes sense to include measures to help the clean energy industry . \u201d\nStill , Lashof acknowledged that the tax breaks may have to wait until a fourth or fifth coronavirus stimulus package materializes .\n\u201c Clearly , climate is not central to what happens right now , \u201d he said . \u201c But whenever there \u2019 s a fourth or fifth package\u2014and we \u2019 re thinking about a longer-term strategy to get the economy moving in the right direction toward decarbonization\u2014there \u2019 s a lot of other things that will need to be done . \u201d\nMeanwhile , groups affiliated with the fossil fuel industry are gearing up to oppose the inclusion of the renewable tax breaks in the coronavirus aid .\n\u201c Some Democrats in Congress are showing their true colors today .
