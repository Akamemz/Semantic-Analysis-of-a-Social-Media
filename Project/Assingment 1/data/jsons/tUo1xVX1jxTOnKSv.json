    "content": "As a presidential candidate in August 2015 , Donald Trump huddled with a longtime friend , media executive David Pecker , in his cluttered 26th floor Trump Tower office and made a request .\nWhat can you do to help my campaign ? he asked , according to people familiar with the meeting .\nMr. Pecker , chief executive of American Media Inc. , offered to use his National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump .\nLess than a year later , Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pecker to quash the story of a former Playboy model who said they \u2019 d had an affair . Mr. Pecker \u2019 s company soon paid $ 150,000 to the model , Karen McDougal , to keep her from speaking publicly about it . Mr. Trump later thanked Mr. Pecker for the assistance .\nThe Trump Tower meeting and its aftermath are among several previously unreported instances in which Mr. Trump intervened directly to suppress stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women , according to interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them , as well as court papers , corporate records and other documents .\nWhile President Trump publicly fought with women leading up to the 2016 election , in private he directed schemes to silence their stories of two alleged affairs . Here \u2019 s a timeline of Trump \u2019 s personal involvement .\nTaken together , the accounts refute a two-year pattern of denials by Mr. Trump , his legal team and his advisers that he was involved in payoffs to Ms. McDougal and a former adult-film star . They also raise the possibility that the president of the United States violated federal campaign-finance laws .\nThe Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the agreements . He directed deals in phone calls and meetings with his self-described fixer , Michael Cohen , and others . The U.S. attorney \u2019 s office in Manhattan has gathered evidence of Mr. Trump \u2019 s participation in the transactions .\nOn Thursday , the White House referred questions about Mr. Trump \u2019 s involvement in the hush deals to the president \u2019 s outside counsel Jay Sekulow , who declined to comment .\nIn an Oct. 23 interview with the Journal , Mr. Trump declined to address whether he had ever discussed the payments with Mr. Cohen during the campaign .\n\u201c Nobody cares about that , \u201d he said . He described Mr. Cohen as a \u201c public-relations person \u201d who \u201c represented me on very small things . \u201d\nMr. Cohen , who left the Trump Organization to serve as the president \u2019 s personal attorney in early 2017 , and other aides denied Mr. Trump played any role in the two hush-money deals when they were first reported in the Journal .\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan came to believe otherwise . In August , they outlined Mr. Trump \u2019 s role\u2014without specifically naming him\u2014in a roughly 80-page draft federal indictment they had been preparing to file against Mr. Cohen .\nWhen Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty that month to campaign-finance violations , prosecutors filed a 22-page charging document asserting that Mr. Cohen \u201c coordinated with one or more members of the campaign , including through meetings and phone calls , about the fact , nature , and timing of the payments . \u201d\nThe unnamed campaign member or members referred to Mr. Trump , according to people familiar with the document .\nThe revelations about Mr. Trump \u2019 s involvement in the hush-money deals come as special counsel Robert Mueller continues his probe into Russian electoral interference , and as a newly elected Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has signaled its intention to investigate the Trump administration when it takes power . Manhattan federal prosecutors who investigated Mr. Cohen are now examining business dealings by the Trump Organization .\nMr. Cohen , who implicated the president in his crimes when he pleaded guilty in August , has met with investigators for Mr. Mueller and with federal prosecutors in New York , seeking to provide information that could mitigate his punishment . His sentencing hearing is set for Dec. 12 .\nHe told federal prosecutors he conferred with Mr. Trump in the weeks before the 2016 election about paying Stephanie Clifford , the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels , to keep quiet about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . He told them that Mr. Trump urged him to \u201c get it done . \u201d\nMr. Cohen has also described to prosecutors his discussions with Mr. Trump and a Trump Organization executive about how to pay Ms. Clifford without leaving the candidate \u2019 s fingerprints on the deal .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s involvement in the payments , by itself , wouldn \u2019 t mean he is guilty of federal crimes , according to Richard Hasen , a law professor at University of California , Irvine , who specializes in election law . A criminal conviction would require proof Mr. Trump willfully skirted legal prohibitions on contributions from companies or from individuals in excess of $ 2,700 , he said .\nWhen the Justice Department accused John Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , of using illegal campaign contributions to conceal an affair during his 2008 presidential run , he argued the money was meant to hide his mistress from his wife , not to influence the election . A jury acquitted him of one charge and deadlocked on the rest .\nMr. Trump was leading in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination in the summer of 2015 after announcing his candidacy for president . His past behavior with women\u2014flings with models and divorces that played out in the New York tabloids\u2014caused concern among his advisers .\nMr. Pecker could help manage bad press . The men \u2019 s relationship dated to the 1990s , when Mr. Pecker \u2019 s former employer , Hachette Filipacchi Magazines , put out \u201c Trump Style , \u201d a quarterly magazine for guests at Trump properties .\nWhen Mr. Pecker took over as chief executive of American Media in the late 1990s , he imposed a moratorium on negative stories about Mr. Trump , who was known among Enquirer staff as an \u201c F.O.P. , \u201d or Friend of Pecker .\nMr. Pecker \u2019 s August 2015 Trump Tower meeting was arranged by Mr. Cohen . The media executive promised Mr. Trump he would flag to Mr. Cohen any negative stories about women that came to the Enquirer \u2019 s attention .\nIn May 2016 , Ms. McDougal , the 1998 Playmate of the year , began to consider telling her story of a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump . She believed the story would come out regardless , after another former Playboy model posted a tweet alluding to a relationship between the two .\nMs. McDougal retained Keith Davidson , a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in representing women who \u2019 d had affairs with celebrities . Mr. Davidson reached out to Dylan Howard , American Media \u2019 s New York-based chief content officer , to gauge the company \u2019 s interest in buying Ms. McDougal \u2019 s story .\nMessrs. Pecker and Howard alerted Mr. Cohen , who in turn warned Mr. Trump , by then the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , who in turn phoned Mr. Pecker for help .\nOn June 20 , 2016 , Mr. Howard flew to Los Angeles to meet Ms. McDougal at her lawyer \u2019 s office .\nMr. Howard spent hours interviewing Ms. McDougal , pressing her for every detail of the alleged affair . Ms. McDougal seemed reluctant to go public with her story .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to be the next Monica Lewinsky , \u201d Ms. McDougal said , referring to the young White House intern who was vilified after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public . Mr. Howard told her that without documents corroborating her story , it wouldn \u2019 t be worth more than $ 15,000 .\nWhen Mr. Howard finished interviewing Ms. McDougal that day , he and Mr. Pecker got on a three-way call with Mr. Cohen to discuss what she had said . They noted she had produced no proof of an affair with Mr. Trump .\nMr. Howard told Mr. Davidson that Ms. McDougal should get back in touch if she found any evidence of the alleged affair .\nAfter the meeting , Messrs. Pecker and Howard learned Ms. McDougal had also been meeting with investigative reporters at ABC News about sharing her story in a televised interview .\nMr. Cohen updated Mr. Trump on developments throughout . The ABC talks prompted American Media to offer to buy Ms. McDougal \u2019 s story for $ 150,000 in early August .\nThe contract gave the publisher the exclusive rights to her story , and guaranteed Ms. McDougal and American Media two magazine covers on which she would appear as a model . As part of the deal , American Media had the option of publishing health and fitness columns under Ms. McDougal \u2019 s name .\nIn a Skype call , Mr. Howard told Ms. McDougal the covers and columns would help resuscitate her modeling career .\nMr. Pecker researched campaign-finance laws before entering into the McDougal deal . The question was : Would American Media \u2019 s payment amount to an illegal campaign contribution to Mr. Trump ? Corporations are barred under federal law from giving directly to candidates , either in cash or in-kind contributions .\nAfter speaking with an election-law specialist , Mr. Pecker concluded the company \u2019 s payment to Ms. McDougal wouldn \u2019 t violate the law , because the magazine covers and health columns gave him a business justification for the deal .\nThe contract had an effective date of Aug. 5 , 2016 . Ms. McDougal signed it the following day .\nMr. Cohen assured Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump would reimburse the publisher , and they began to devise a repayment plan at the end of that month .\nConcerned Mr. Pecker might leave American Media , Mr. Cohen wanted to buy other materials the company had gathered on Mr. Trump over the years , including source files and tips . In a meeting at the Trump Organization offices in early September , Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump of his plan .\nMr. Cohen , who complained to associates about Mr. Trump \u2019 s frugality , was also worried his boss would balk at reimbursing Mr. Pecker . He secretly recorded Mr. Trump discussing the deal .\n\u201c Um , I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend , David , you know , so that\u2014I \u2019 m going to do that right away , \u201d said Mr. Cohen , according to a copy of the audio file .\nAs Mr. Cohen explained his plans , Mr. Trump spoke over him : \u201c So , what are we gon na pay\u2026One-fifty ? \u201d Mr. Trump asked . Mr. Cohen paused and replied , \u201c Yes . \u201d\nMr. Cohen said he would be getting \u201c all the stuff , \u201d meaning the other files on Mr. Trump he had been seeking . They discussed the uncertainty about what might become of the files if Mr. Pecker no longer ran American Media . \u201c Yeah , I was thinking about that , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Maybe he gets hit by a truck . \u201d\nMessrs. Pecker and Cohen signed a contract for the transfer of the McDougal story in late September . Mr. Cohen set up a shell company in Delaware for the transaction on Sept. 30 .\nThe publisher would assign the rights to Ms. McDougal \u2019 s story to Mr. Cohen for $ 125,000\u2014the value they put on Ms. McDougal \u2019 s agreement with American Media minus the magazine covers and fitness columns , the rights to which the publisher would retain .\nMr. Pecker called off the Trump-reimbursement deal in October 2016 on the advice of his lawyer . Accepting reimbursement from Mr. Trump , the executive worried , could undermine any argument that the McDougal payment was made for editorial and business reasons , rather than as an in-kind campaign contribution .\nMr. Pecker told Mr. Cohen to tear up the reimbursement agreement , but Mr. Cohen kept a copy . Federal agents found it in a search of Mr. Cohen \u2019 s office earlier this year .\nAs the McDougal deal came together , another woman was shopping her story of an alleged tryst with Mr. Trump .\nEarlier in 2016 , an agent for Ms. Clifford , the adult-film actress , had approached Mr. Howard about selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . The agent , Gina Rodriguez , was seeking upward of $ 200,000 for the story , but Mr. Howard passed .\nMs. Clifford \u2019 s story\u2014she said she had sex with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe a decade earlier\u2014had already been told in 2011 on a gossip blog , The Dirty . Mr. Howard reminded Ms. Rodriguez that Ms. Clifford had called the report \u201c bulls\u2014 \u201d when contacted five years earlier by entertainment channel E ! .\nMs. Clifford gained more leverage on Oct. 7 , when the Washington Post published previously unaired footage from a 2005 appearance by Mr. Trump on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Access Hollywood. \u201d Mr. Trump could be heard on the video chatting with host Billy Bush about groping women .\nAfter the tape surfaced , nearly upending Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign , Ms. Rodriguez reached out to Mr. Howard and told him Ms. Clifford was prepared to go public . Ms. Clifford , through her agent , was in preliminary talks with ABC \u2019 s \u201c Good Morning America . \u201d\nMr. Howard alerted Mr. Pecker , and they separately spoke to Mr. Cohen about Ms. Clifford . The Trump camp at the time was scrambling to contain fallout from the tape , as women came forward with stories of sexual misconduct by the candidate , all of which he denied .\nMs. Clifford had taken a polygraph test in 2011 , when another celebrity publication , Life & Style , was vetting her claims of a sexual encounter . When asked whether she had unprotected sex with Mr. Trump , she answered \u201c yes , \u201d and the examiner found no signs of deception .\nMr. Cohen had been able to kill that earlier story with a legal threat . Ms. Clifford and Ms. Rodriguez wouldn \u2019 t be intimidated this time .\nMr. Cohen asked American Media to buy Ms. Clifford \u2019 s story . Mr. Pecker refused on the grounds that he didn \u2019 t want his company to pay a porn star .\nMessrs. Cohen and Trump would have to handle the payment themselves . Mr. Cohen told federal prosecutors he relayed the news to Mr. Trump in his Trump Tower office in the second week of October 2016 .\nThat is when Mr. Trump , smarting from the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape , told Mr. Cohen to \u201c get it done , \u201d according to Mr. Cohen \u2019 s account to prosecutors .\nWithin days , Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson had negotiated a nondisclosure agreement for Ms. Clifford .\nThe money was slow in coming because Mr. Trump , Mr. Cohen and the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization , Allen Weisselberg , couldn \u2019 t settle on a plan for getting it to Mr. Davidson without anyone being able to trace it back to Mr. Trump , according to Mr. Cohen \u2019 s account to prosecutors . Among the options they considered : routing the payment through a Trump-owned property , Mr. Cohen told prosecutors .\nMr. Cohen offered a suggestion : Why not have Mr. Weisselberg make the payment ? \u201c You \u2019 re the CFO , \u201d he told the longtime Trump aide , according to Mr. Cohen \u2019 s account to prosecutors . \u201c You pay this. \u201d Mr. Weisselberg said he couldn \u2019 t come up with the money .\nMary Mulligan , a lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg , said he had been \u201c fully cooperative \u201d with the investigation and declined to comment further . A person close to Mr. Weisselberg disputed the account Mr. Cohen gave to prosecutors .\nMr. Cohen had told Mr. Davidson to expect a $ 130,000 wire transfer by Oct. 14 , but missed the deadline , as well as an extension , prompting Ms. Clifford to walk away .\nWhile Mr. Cohen considered a path forward , he offered excuses to Ms. Clifford \u2019 s camp . He told Mr. Davidson banks were closed for the Jewish holidays and he couldn \u2019 t reach Mr. Trump on the campaign trail . \u201c My guy is in five states today , \u201d Mr. Cohen said .\nMr. Davidson told Mr. Howard on Oct. 25 , 2016 , that Ms. Clifford would soon speak publicly . Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen that they needed to coordinate \u201c or it could look awfully bad for everyone . \u201d\nIn a tense three-way call on an encrypted app , Messrs. Pecker and Howard urged Mr. Cohen to complete the deal before Ms. Clifford disclosed the hush-money negotiations .\nOut of options and time , Mr. Cohen decided to cover the payment himself . \u201c F\u2014 it , I \u2019 m just going to do it , \u201d he told Mr. Davidson in a phone call .\nHe drew down his home-equity line and transferred $ 130,000 to Mr. Davidson on Oct. 27 . Ms. Clifford signed a fresh nondisclosure agreement the next day .\nThat month , a news site called \u201c The Smoking Gun \u201d published an account of Ms. Clifford \u2019 s alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . Then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon confronted the candidate . Mr. Trump told them the encounter never happened .\nFour days before the 2016 election , The Wall Street Journal revealed the $ 150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal by American Media . The company said at the time Ms. McDougal had been paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and denied buying her story to protect Mr. Trump .\nThe Trump campaign professed ignorance . \u201c We have no knowledge of any of this , \u201d Hope Hicks , Mr. Trump \u2019 s spokeswoman , said of the McDougal deal . Ms. Hicks , who discussed the matter with Mr. Trump before issuing the comment , was relaying what she had been told , according to people familiar with the conversation . She also denied Mr. Trump had sex with Ms. McDougal .\nAs Mr. Trump headed to victory on Nov. 8 , Mr. Howard joined Mr. Cohen at the candidate \u2019 s election night celebration at the New York Hilton .\nLater that month , after Mr. Trump \u2019 s election win , Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Weisselberg to discuss reimbursement for the payment to Ms. Clifford , Mr. Cohen has told federal prosecutors .\nWhile Mr. Cohen waited , he asked Mr. Pecker to lobby Mr. Trump to pay him more money .\nMr. Pecker visited Trump Tower twice during the presidential transition . When he raised Mr. Cohen \u2019 s request during a meeting in the first week of December 2016 , Mr. Trump demurred , saying Mr. Cohen had plenty of money . During Mr. Pecker \u2019 s second visit , in January 2017 , Mr. Trump thanked him for suppressing the McDougal story .\nIt would turn out to be a costly deal for Mr. Trump .\nHad he just paid the ex-adult film star himself , Mr. Trump would have been out of pocket $ 130,000 . Instead , Mr. Weisselberg authorized a reimbursement of twice that much , characterized in Mr. Trump \u2019 s records as legal fees , to cover the income tax hit Mr. Cohen would take . He also added a $ 60,000 bonus . Mr. Cohen received the money in monthly installments of $ 35,000 .\nIn the first year of Mr. Trump \u2019 s presidency , American Media continued to feature him on the Enquirer cover . In July 2017 , Mr. Trump hosted Messrs. Pecker and Howard at the White House for dinner , an Oval Office visit and a private tour of the Lincoln Bedroom led by the president .\nAfter the Journal reported on the payment to Ms. Clifford in January 2018 , the relationships between Messrs. Trump , Cohen and Pecker began to fracture .\nMs. Clifford , initially willing to keep quiet , began to seek more exposure and threatened to break the agreement after Mr. Cohen acknowledged paying her in a February statement to the news media . Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to coordinate with his son Eric Trump to silence Ms. Clifford in arbitration . It didn \u2019 t work ; Ms. Clifford ignored the arbitrator \u2019 s restraining order .\nMr. Cohen continued to insist he had done the deal with Ms. Clifford on his own , while Mr. Trump said he knew nothing about it when talking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5 .\n\u201c You \u2019 ll have to ask Michael Cohen , \u201d the president said . \u201c Michael is my attorney . \u201d\nDays later , on April 9 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen \u2019 s office , apartment and hotel room . Agents approached Messrs. Pecker and Howard . Federal prosecutors subpoenaed American Media and the Trump Organization , among others .\nAs Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Mr. Cohen and the payment , American Media turned on Mr. Cohen , with a National Enquirer cover featuring the headline , \u201c Trump Fixer \u2019 s Secrets & Lies. \u201d Mr. Cohen learned he had been let go as Mr. Trump \u2019 s personal attorney when he saw it on television .\nBoth Messrs. Cohen and Pecker began seeking to minimize their exposure . Mr. Pecker , granted immunity for his grand jury testimony , told investigators about Mr. Trump \u2019 s involvement in the McDougal deal .\nThree years after Mr. Pecker promised to work with Mr. Cohen to help Mr. Trump , the deals they made have unraveled . Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford have both been let out of their hush agreements after filing lawsuits .",

Ms. McDougal seemed reluctant to go public with her story.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the next Monica Lewinsky,\u201d Ms. McDougal said, referring to the young White House intern who was vilified after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public. Mr. Howard told her that without documents corroborating her story, it wouldn\u2019t be worth more than $15,000.\n\nWhen Mr. Howard finished interviewing Ms. McDougal that day, he and Mr. Pecker got on a three-way call with Mr. Cohen to discuss what she had said. They noted she had produced no proof of an affair with Mr. Trump.\n\nBrendan McDermid/REUTERS Michael Cohen on whether he is loyal to Donald Trump 2017 \u201918 \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.\u201d \u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\u201d Mark Wilson/Getty Images Donald Trump on whether he knew about the payment to Stormy Daniels 2017 \u201918 Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels? \u201cNo.\u201d Do you know where he got the money to make that payment? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties.\u201d Mary Altaffer/AP Photo Michael Cohen on why he paid Stormy Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford 2017 \u201918 \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d \u201c[The payment was made] for the purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s spokespeople on whether he reimbursed Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment 2017 \u201918 \u201cNone of these allegations are true.\u201d \u2014Sarah Sanders \u201c[Trump] paid him back.

He was like a public-relations person.\u201d\n\nMr. Howard told Mr. Davidson that Ms. McDougal should get back in touch if she found any evidence of the alleged affair.\n\nAfter the meeting, Messrs. Pecker and Howard learned Ms. McDougal had also been meeting with investigative reporters at ABC News about sharing her story in a televised interview.\n\nMr. Cohen updated Mr. Trump on developments throughout. The ABC talks prompted American Media to offer to buy Ms. McDougal\u2019s story for $150,000 in early August.\n\nThe contract gave the publisher the exclusive rights to her story, and guaranteed Ms. McDougal and American Media two magazine covers on which she would appear as a model. As part of the deal, American Media had the option of publishing health and fitness columns under Ms. McDougal\u2019s name.\n\nIn a Skype call, Mr. Howard told Ms. McDougal the covers and columns would help resuscitate her modeling career.\n\nMr. Pecker researched campaign-finance laws before entering into the McDougal deal. The question was: Would American Media\u2019s payment amount to an illegal campaign contribution to Mr. Trump? Corporations are barred under federal law from giving directly to candidates, either in cash or in-kind contributions.\n\nAfter speaking with an election-law specialist, Mr. Pecker concluded the company\u2019s payment to Ms. McDougal wouldn\u2019t violate the law, because the magazine covers and health columns gave him a business justification for the deal.\n\nThe contract had an effective date of Aug. 5, 2016. Ms. McDougal signed it the following day.\n\nMr. Cohen assured Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump would reimburse the publisher, and they began to devise a repayment plan at the end of that month.\n\n\u2018All the stuff\u2019\n\nConcerned Mr. Pecker might leave American Media, Mr. Cohen wanted to buy other materials the company had gathered on Mr. Trump over the years, including source files and tips. In a meeting at the Trump Organization offices in early September, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump of his plan.\n\nMr. Cohen, who complained to associates about Mr. Trump\u2019s frugality, was also worried his boss would balk at reimbursing Mr. Pecker. He secretly recorded Mr. Trump discussing the deal.\n\n\u201cUm, I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David, you know, so that\u2014I\u2019m going to do that right away,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, according to a copy of the audio file.\n\nAs Mr. Cohen explained his plans, Mr. Trump spoke over him: \u201cSo, what are we gonna pay\u2026One-fifty?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. Mr. Cohen paused and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMr. Cohen said he would be getting \u201call the stuff,\u201d meaning the other files on Mr. Trump he had been seeking. They discussed the uncertainty about what might become of the files if Mr. Pecker no longer ran American Media. \u201cYeah, I was thinking about that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe he gets hit by a truck.\u201d\n\nMessrs. Pecker and Cohen signed a contract for the transfer of the McDougal story in late September. Mr. Cohen set up a shell company in Delaware for the transaction on Sept. 30.\n\nThe publisher would assign the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story to Mr. Cohen for $125,000\u2014the value they put on Ms. McDougal\u2019s agreement with American Media minus the magazine covers and fitness columns, the rights to which the publisher would retain.\n\nMr. Pecker called off the Trump-reimbursement deal in October 2016 on the advice of his lawyer. Accepting reimbursement from Mr. Trump, the executive worried, could undermine any argument that the McDougal payment was made for editorial and business reasons, rather than as an in-kind campaign contribution.\n\nMr. Pecker told Mr. Cohen to tear up the reimbursement agreement, but Mr. Cohen kept a copy. Federal agents found it in a search of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office earlier this year.\n\nStormy surfaces\n\nAs the McDougal deal came together, another woman was shopping her story of an alleged tryst with Mr. Trump.\n\nEarlier in 2016, an agent for Ms. Clifford, the adult-film actress, had approached Mr. Howard about selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The agent, Gina Rodriguez, was seeking upward of $200,000 for the story, but Mr. Howard passed.\n\nMs. Clifford\u2019s story\u2014she said she had sex with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe a decade earlier\u2014had already been told in 2011 on a gossip blog, The Dirty. Mr. Howard reminded Ms. Rodriguez that Ms. Clifford had called the report \u201cbulls\u2014\u201d when contacted five years earlier by entertainment channel E!.\n\nMs. Clifford gained more leverage on Oct. 7, when the Washington Post published previously unaired footage from a 2005 appearance by Mr. Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d Mr. Trump could be heard on the video chatting with host Billy Bush about groping women.\n\nAfter the tape surfaced, nearly upending Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Ms. Rodriguez reached out to Mr. Howard and told him Ms. Clifford was prepared to go public. Ms. Clifford, through her agent, was in preliminary talks with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBrendan McDermid/REUTERS Michael Cohen on whether he is loyal to Donald Trump 2017 \u201918 \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.\u201d \u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\u201d Mark Wilson/Getty Images Donald Trump on whether he knew about the payment to Stormy Daniels 2017 \u201918 Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels? \u201cNo.\u201d Do you know where he got the money to make that payment? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties.\u201d Mary Altaffer/AP Photo Michael Cohen on why he paid Stormy Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford 2017 \u201918 \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d \u201c[The payment was made] for the purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s spokespeople on whether he reimbursed Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment 2017 \u201918 \u201cNone of these allegations are true.\u201d \u2014Sarah Sanders \u201c[Trump] paid him back.

He was like a public-relations person.\u201d\n\nMr. Howard alerted Mr. Pecker, and they separately spoke to Mr. Cohen about Ms. Clifford. The Trump camp at the time was scrambling to contain fallout from the tape, as women came forward with stories of sexual misconduct by the candidate, all of which he denied.\n\nMs. Clifford had taken a polygraph test in 2011, when another celebrity publication, Life & Style, was vetting her claims of a sexual encounter. When asked whether she had unprotected sex with Mr. Trump, she answered \u201cyes,\u201d and the examiner found no signs of deception.\n\nMr. Cohen had been able to kill that earlier story with a legal threat. Ms. Clifford and Ms. Rodriguez wouldn\u2019t be intimidated this time.\n\nMr. Cohen asked American Media to buy Ms. Clifford\u2019s story. Mr. Pecker refused on the grounds that he didn\u2019t want his company to pay a porn star.\n\nMessrs. Cohen and Trump would have to handle the payment themselves. Mr. Cohen told federal prosecutors he relayed the news to Mr. Trump in his Trump Tower office in the second week of October 2016.\n\nThat is when Mr. Trump, smarting from the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, told Mr. Cohen to \u201cget it done,\u201d according to Mr. Cohen\u2019s account to prosecutors.\n\nWithin days, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson had negotiated a nondisclosure agreement for Ms. Clifford.\n\nThe money was slow in coming because Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, couldn\u2019t settle on a plan for getting it to Mr. Davidson without anyone being able to trace it back to Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Cohen\u2019s account to prosecutors. Among the options they considered: routing the payment through a Trump-owned property, Mr. Cohen told prosecutors.\n\nMr. Cohen offered a suggestion: Why not have Mr. Weisselberg make the payment? \u201cYou\u2019re the CFO,\u201d he told the longtime Trump aide, according to Mr. Cohen\u2019s account to prosecutors. \u201cYou pay this.\u201d Mr. Weisselberg said he couldn\u2019t come up with the money.\n\nMary Mulligan, a lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg, said he had been \u201cfully cooperative\u201d with the investigation and declined to comment further. A person close to Mr. Weisselberg disputed the account Mr. Cohen gave to prosecutors.\n\nMr. Cohen had told Mr. Davidson to expect a $130,000 wire transfer by Oct. 14, but missed the deadline, as well as an extension, prompting Ms. Clifford to walk away.\n\nWhile Mr. Cohen considered a path forward, he offered excuses to Ms. Clifford\u2019s camp. He told Mr. Davidson banks were closed for the Jewish holidays and he couldn\u2019t reach Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. \u201cMy guy is in five states today,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\n\nMr. Davidson told Mr. Howard on Oct. 25, 2016, that Ms. Clifford would soon speak publicly. Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen that they needed to coordinate \u201cor it could look awfully bad for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn a tense three-way call on an encrypted app, Messrs. Pecker and Howard urged Mr. Cohen to complete the deal before Ms. Clifford disclosed the hush-money negotiations.\n\nOut of options and time, Mr. Cohen decided to cover the payment himself. \u201cF\u2014 it, I\u2019m just going to do it,\u201d he told Mr. Davidson in a phone call.\n\nHe drew down his home-equity line and transferred $130,000 to Mr. Davidson on Oct. 27. Ms. Clifford signed a fresh nondisclosure agreement the next day.\n\nThat month, a news site called \u201cThe Smoking Gun\u201d published an account of Ms. Clifford\u2019s alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon confronted the candidate. Mr. Trump told them the encounter never happened.\n\nFour days before the 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal revealed the $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal by American Media. The company said at the time Ms. McDougal had been paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and denied buying her story to protect Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign professed ignorance. \u201cWe have no knowledge of any of this,\u201d Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, said of the McDougal deal. Ms. Hicks, who discussed the matter with Mr. Trump before issuing the comment, was relaying what she had been told, according to people familiar with the conversation. She also denied Mr. Trump had sex with Ms. McDougal.\n\nAs Mr. Trump headed to victory on Nov. 8, Mr. Howard joined Mr. Cohen at the candidate\u2019s election night celebration at the New York Hilton.\n\nRepaying Cohen\n\nLater that month, after Mr. Trump\u2019s election win, Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Weisselberg to discuss reimbursement for the payment to Ms. Clifford, Mr. Cohen has told federal prosecutors.\n\nBrendan McDermid/REUTERS Michael Cohen on whether he is loyal to Donald Trump 2017 \u201918 \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.\u201d \u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\u201d Mark Wilson/Getty Images Donald Trump on whether he knew about the payment to Stormy Daniels 2017 \u201918 Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels? \u201cNo.\u201d Do you know where he got the money to make that payment? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties.\u201d Mary Altaffer/AP Photo Michael Cohen on why he paid Stormy Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford 2017 \u201918 \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d \u201c[The payment was made] for the purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s spokespeople on whether he reimbursed Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment 2017 \u201918 \u201cNone of these allegations are true.\u201d \u2014Sarah Sanders \u201c[Trump] paid him back.

He was like a public-relations person.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Cohen waited, he asked Mr. Pecker to lobby Mr. Trump to pay him more money.\n\nMr. Pecker visited Trump Tower twice during the presidential transition. When he raised Mr. Cohen\u2019s request during a meeting in the first week of December 2016, Mr. Trump demurred, saying Mr. Cohen had plenty of money. During Mr. Pecker\u2019s second visit, in January 2017, Mr. Trump thanked him for suppressing the McDougal story.\n\nMr. Weisselberg soon completed the reimbursement plan.\n\nIt would turn out to be a costly deal for Mr. Trump.\n\nHad he just paid the ex-adult film star himself, Mr. Trump would have been out of pocket $130,000. Instead, Mr. Weisselberg authorized a reimbursement of twice that much, characterized in Mr. Trump\u2019s records as legal fees, to cover the income tax hit Mr. Cohen would take. He also added a $60,000 bonus. Mr. Cohen received the money in monthly installments of $35,000.\n\nIn the first year of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, American Media continued to feature him on the Enquirer cover. In July 2017, Mr. Trump hosted Messrs. Pecker and Howard at the White House for dinner, an Oval Office visit and a private tour of the Lincoln Bedroom led by the president.\n\nAfter the Journal reported on the payment to Ms. Clifford in January 2018, the relationships between Messrs. Trump, Cohen and Pecker began to fracture.\n\nMs. Clifford, initially willing to keep quiet, began to seek more exposure and threatened to break the agreement after Mr. Cohen acknowledged paying her in a February statement to the news media. Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to coordinate with his son Eric Trump to silence Ms. Clifford in arbitration. It didn\u2019t work; Ms. Clifford ignored the arbitrator\u2019s restraining order.\n\nMr. Cohen continued to insist he had done the deal with Ms. Clifford on his own, while Mr. Trump said he knew nothing about it when talking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen,\u201d the president said. \u201cMichael is my attorney.\u201d\n\nDays later, on April 9, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, apartment and hotel room. Agents approached Messrs. Pecker and Howard. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed American Media and the Trump Organization, among others.\n\nBrendan McDermid/REUTERS Michael Cohen on whether he is loyal to Donald Trump 2017 \u201918 \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.\u201d \u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\u201d Mark Wilson/Getty Images Donald Trump on whether he knew about the payment to Stormy Daniels 2017 \u201918 Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels? \u201cNo.\u201d Do you know where he got the money to make that payment? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties.\u201d Mary Altaffer/AP Photo Michael Cohen on why he paid Stormy Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford 2017 \u201918 \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d \u201c[The payment was made] for the purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s spokespeople on whether he reimbursed Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment 2017 \u201918 \u201cNone of these allegations are true.\u201d \u2014Sarah Sanders \u201c[Trump] paid him back.

He was like a public-relations person.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Mr. Cohen and the payment, American Media turned on Mr. Cohen, with a National Enquirer cover featuring the headline, \u201cTrump Fixer\u2019s Secrets & Lies.\u201d Mr. Cohen learned he had been let go as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney when he saw it on television.\n\nBoth Messrs. Cohen and Pecker began seeking to minimize their exposure. Mr. Pecker, granted immunity for his grand jury testimony, told investigators about Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the McDougal deal.\n\nThree years after Mr. Pecker promised to work with Mr. Cohen to help Mr. Trump, the deals they made have unraveled. Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford have both been let out of their hush agreements after filing lawsuits.\n\nThe three men no longer speak to one another.\n\nWrite to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com, Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com, Michael Rothfeld at michael.rothfeld@wsj.com, Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com",
