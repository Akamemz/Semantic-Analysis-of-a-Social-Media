    "content": "The would-be 2016 presidential candidates are increasingly seeing the benefits to waiting longer before declaring their intentions \u2014 including the dominant person in the race , Hillary Clinton , who shows few signs of making a decision before next year .\nDespite a commanding lead among Democrats and the widespread expectation that she \u2019 ll run , Clinton is still uncertain about whether to launch a second run for president , according to several people familiar with her thinking in recent weeks .\nWhile some advisers suggested she should form an exploratory committee this year to send a signal to donors , her allies who argued otherwise have won the debate \u2014 with no committee expected until well after Jan. 1 , the sources said .\n\u201c She should take her time , \u201d said one adviser who believes that the high-profile Clinton would only give license to her critics by becoming a declared candidate too early .\nLast time , Clinton felt pushed into the race earlier than she \u2019 d wanted to be by Barack Obama \u2019 s January 2007 announcement of an exploratory committee . Now she appears comfortable moving at a slower pace . She is still scheduling paid speeches , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 first reported , as late as Feb. 24 \u2013 suggesting she \u2019 s unlikely to be a declared candidate until after that date . What \u2019 s more , the man she is expected to tap for a major role in her campaign , current White House adviser John Podesta , has raised the possibility of remaining in his job until after the State of the Union address in late January .\nRepublican operatives familiar with discussions about how to attack Clinton said at least two outside GOP groups may go up with ads to define her in early 2015 , especially if she waits for several weeks to launch a campaign .\nClinton could , in January , make clear she \u2019 s running but delay an announcement . And if she doesn \u2019 t intend to run , she would be criticized for harming the party \u2019 s chances of holding the White House if she waits much beyond mid-January , several Democratic insiders said .\nClinton is by no means the only candidate waiting until next year . Other than Jim Webb , the long-shot former Virginia senator who recently launched an exploratory committee , the people likeliest to announce intentions now are those who aren \u2019 t running .\nThat was apparent early Tuesday morning , when Ohio Sen . Rob Portman told a local newspaper that he planned to seek reelection to the Senate instead of launching a national campaign .\nPortman \u2019 s decision will have little bearing on what other Republicans decide to do in a field of up to 20 potential candidates . But at a moment when national politics seems relatively quiet , it provided clarity that the invisible primary is taking shape behind the scenes . Anyone considering running is assessing their chances , talking to supporters and debating when to make a move .\nFor the 2008 election , the last time there was an open White House seat , candidates started announcing exploratory committees as early as December 2006 , looking for an edge in a crowded field . In the 2012 race , with an incumbent President Obama , most Republicans waited until well into 2011 before declaring their intentions .\nThe 2016 campaign is poised to look more like 2012 than 2008 , with the majority of the major candidates waiting at least until January to make an announcement \u2013 and some saying they \u2019 ll put off a decision until summer . The debates this cycle are unlikely to start until August , and the Iowa caucuses may happen in February 2016 , instead of January , giving candidates an additional cushion .\n\u201c The benefits of starting early aren \u2019 t what they were eight years ago , \u201d said Republican strategist Chip Saltsman , who managed Mike Huckabee \u2019 s dark-horse campaign in 2008 . \u201c For some of the bigger names out there , they \u2019 re a known quantity and they don \u2019 t feel like they need to get out of the box early . \u201d\nIn 2012 , former Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty was harmed by his early entry into the presidential race , in March 2011 . He faltered and ultimately cratered at the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa over the summer . By contrast , Rick Perry , the outgoing Texas governor , entered the race in August \u2013 giving him no time to recover from serious blunders .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re going to see anybody go out before the end of the year , and I \u2019 m not so sure you \u2019 re going to see anyone officially get in until maybe late first quarter , \u201d said Saltsman , adding that big money super PACs alleviate the fundraising imperative and thus provide potential candidates more time to weigh their options . \u201c And I think the bulk of people will get in during the second quarter . \u201d\nThere is little question , in interviews with more than a dozen operatives and donors , that Clinton is the dominant figure in both primaries . Some Republicans may see a window in early 2015 , if she still hasn \u2019 t declared , to try to position themselves as the strongest \u201c anti-Hillary , \u201d several operatives said .\nThey include Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , a tea party favorite who has the ability to appeal to the party grass roots but has been aggressively courting the New York donor set and begun making a number of hires to broaden his team . He is viewed as already running for president and is likely to declare sooner rather than later , people who \u2019 ve spoken with him say .\nSen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , the libertarian favorite who has attracted attention for his attempts to broaden the party \u2019 s reach among African-American voters , announced Tuesday he will run for reelection . But Paul \u2019 s decision is not just about looking like he wants to defend a seat \u2013 if he runs for president , the time he spends raising money for his seat can also work for a national race down the road .\nOn a conference call with reporters Tuesday , senior advisor Doug Stafford said Paul , who has been the most transparent about his national ambitions , is \u201c still months away \u201d from an official announcement on a White House run .\n\u201c He \u2019 ll make that decision in the early spring , \u201d said Stafford . \u201c We don \u2019 t have an exact hard cut off on that . \u201d\nOne issue for Paul is that legally he can not be on the ballot for president and Senate at the same time , but his team has satisfied itself that there are ways around this .\nJeb Bush appears genuinely torn whether to give it a go . At a Wall Street Journal event on Monday , he said he would decide \u201c in short order , not that far out into the future. \u201d Bush learned earlier this year the dangers of being perceived as a candidate too early : After he described illegal immigration as an \u201c act of love \u201d by families , he was promptly eviscerated by conservatives . He lowered his profile shortly after .\nIf Bush bows out , he \u2019 s expected to say so fairly soon ; no word from him would indicate that he \u2019 s learning toward running . But he doesn \u2019 t have the luxury of waiting until , say , May , given the work involved in launching a campaign operation and soothing Republican donors who are waiting to see what he does before committing to a candidate .\nAnother formidable potential candidate , Republican Scott Walker , seems poised to wait as long as possible before announcing . The Wisconsin governor has kept on a host of aides from his successful reelection campaign for a likely bid , but he said in a recent interview that a formal announcement would not come until after a spring legislative session , and possibly as late as midsummer .\nHis team feels no need to rush because Walker built relationships with the donor class during his successful campaign to beat back an effort to recall him from office .\n\u201c Rick Perry got in too late \u201d in the 2012 election cycle , a senior Walker adviser said recently . \u201c Tim Pawlenty got in too early . So it \u2019 s all about figuring out what \u2019 s just right . \u201d\nMany Republicans have expected that New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie would make a decision shortly after the midterms . But he recently said he plans to wait until after the first of the year .\nSome donors believe Christie will move to form a committee sooner rather than later to be the \u201c first ask \u201d with donors from whom he and Jeb Bush would both seek support .\nThe GOP field has a key advantage this time around that no one other than Mitt Romney had last time \u2013 existing donor networks . Former Romney adviser Kevin Madden said the candidates eying a run seem to be moving at a \u201c a more measured pace \u201d in hiring staff and lining up fundraising commitments .\n\u201c Many like Christie , Paul and Bush , \u201d Madden said , already \u201c have existing core teams or a strong national fundraising base . \u201d\nThere are a handful of other candidates who appear certain to run . Perry is convening donors and seems likely to launch a campaign early next year , given the work he needs to do to restore credibility after his disastrous 2012 run . Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal said in a statement that he \u2019 ll decide \u201c in the first half of next year. \u201d Rick Santorum won the 2012 Iowa caucuses and has made no secret that he \u2019 s running again , but the former Pennsylvania senator is never going to raise huge money , so there \u2019 s little pressure to enter the race early .\nHuckabee , the 2008 caucus winner , would likely draw from Santorum \u2019 s support if he ran . The former Arkansas governor has been speaking with donors and is looking at a possible announcement in April or May if he runs .\nAs for establishment figures , Rep. Paul Ryan , the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee , has said he will wait until 2015 to decide . People close to him believe he is giving it a close look , but would only run if there is a clear path to the nomination .\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio has a book coming out on Jan. 13 , which will be followed by a national book tour that \u2019 s expected to take him into the early presidential nominating states . A formal announcement wouldn \u2019 t likely come until after the tour ends .\nRubio is also up for reelection to the Senate in 2016 and has said he won \u2019 t run for both offices . If Bush runs , Rubio \u2019 s fundraising and path to the nomination would become much more difficult , potentially dissuading him from a White House bid .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich is the only potential candidate who would appear to benefit from Portman \u2019 s decision this week , giving him easier access to the Buckeye State \u2019 s conservative donor network .
