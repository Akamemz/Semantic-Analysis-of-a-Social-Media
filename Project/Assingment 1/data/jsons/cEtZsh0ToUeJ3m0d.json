But it \u2019 s also fair for citizens to worry that the United States is not as safe as it could or should be or to want to see public officials alarmed by the possible uptick in crime that happened last year .\nBut for politicians to make America safer , they would have to actually do something to make America safer . Trump has no idea how to do that , which is why his first two speakers were C-list celebrities complaining that it \u2019 s harder to express open racism these days rather than anyone with anything constructive to say to improve public safety .\nThe rates of murder and violent crime in the United States began to fall in 1991 and then fell steadily through to 2014 , which is the last year for which we have genuinely reliable data .\nThere is some indication that crime may have risen in 2015 , which would be moderately alarming even if it still left crime below the level it was when Barack Obama took office .\nWhat \u2019 s more , despite the generally positive trends , the United States remains an outlier among rich countries in terms of its level of lethal violence :\nGiven the overall trend , Americans should not be alarmist about violent crime .
