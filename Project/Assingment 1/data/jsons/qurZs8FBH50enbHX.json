It 's where I learned that reeling is fun ( though woe betide the toes of anyone with the misfortune to partner me ) ; that if you lead tourists into the tunnels below Edinburgh , one of them will eventually faint ; and that haggis is , if not good exactly , surprisingly okay .\nOn September 18 , Scottish voters will decide whether to become independent from the UK . Because Scotland is such a thoroughly wonderful place , my adoration of it is almost enough for me to get swept up in the romance of its independence campaign , which recent polls suggest may have a chance of succeeding . Almost .\nBut not quite . Because the reality is that independence would expose Scotland to big , unnecessary risks . There are two major categories of risks that Scottish independence would bring : risks associated with becoming independent \u2014 things that Scotland could lose during the process of `` divorce '' from the UK \u2014 and risks associated with being independent once the separation is complete . In both categories , the risks are serious enough that I do n't see how the benefits of independence outweigh them .\nLet 's start with the divorce . There are a lot of ways that could go wrong . Right now , Scotland has relatively few purely `` Scottish '' institutions . Its universities are full of students from the rest of the UK . Its banks relied on London for a bailout when the financial crisis hit . Its research labs rely on UK funding , its wind farms on subsidies administered by Westminster . I could go on , but you get the idea . It 's hardly surprising that Scotland 's economy and institutions act like they 're part of the UK , because , you know , they currently are .\nBut that means that the process of separating out from the UK could be very , very messy . The Royal Bank of Scotland says that it would relocate its headquarters to London in the event of a `` yes '' vote on independence . ( No word yet on whether it would change its name to the Royal Bank of We Sure Are Grateful for that Bailout . ) The green energy sector says that investment in wind power could stagnate for years due to uncertainty over the future of the current subsidy scheme . Scottish universities are worried that they would n't be able to obtain research funding from their current sources and that their best scholars would leave . It 's unclear how much of the UK 's national debt Scotland would be saddled with , or whether independence would lead to costly litigation over the North Sea oil fields . It 's true that all of those things might work out in Scotland 's favor \u2014 but then again , they might not .\nAnd then there are the problems with actually being an independent country . The issue that has gotten the most attention is what currency an independent Scotland would use for its money . The Scottish independence movement has made clear that it wants to keep using the pound , which would mean that Scotland would be at the mercy of the UK 's monetary policy . Even setting aside the lessons of the Eurozone 's recent history on whether it 's a good idea for small countries to rely on a currency union they do n't control ( it 's not ) this is an astonishing plan in the context of the broader arguments for independence . If the pro-independence crowd thinks that the UK is screwing Scotland now , why would it be a good idea for the UK to have control over Scotland 's currency , but no democratic accountability or responsibility for its economy at all whatsoever ?\nThe second option would be for Scotland to join the euro \u2014 as \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Matt Yglesias points out , that may turn out to be mandatory if Scotland joins the EU \u2014 but joining the Eurozone would risk even more severe problems , because the Eurozone has already proven itself to be an economic calamity .\nA newly independent Scotland would also be more vulnerable to economic shocks that arise from circumstances beyond its control , such as if North Sea oil reserves run out sooner than anticipated , or if the price of oil falls . It is of course possible that there 's plenty of oil left and its value will remain high , but it 's still a risk \u2014 and one that Scotland will have greater exposure to as an independent country than as part of the UK .\nMost of the pro-independence arguments rely on claims that those issues will work out in Scotland 's favor \u2014 that they 'll keep the pound and it will go fine , that there 's plenty of oil , that independence will have an invigorating effect on the business sector \u2014 but that still leaves us with the question of why Scotland should expose itself to the risk that those predictions might be wrong .\nThere 's no reason to accept the possibility of great losses unless it 's in exchange for a possibility of great gains .

It 's not as if the Scots are fleeing persecution \u2014 they just have legitimate political differences with the rest of the UK .
