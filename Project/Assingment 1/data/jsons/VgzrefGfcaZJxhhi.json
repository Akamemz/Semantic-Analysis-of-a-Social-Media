    "content": "As the government shutdown continues , it 's worth underscoring that the precipitating factor\u2014President Donald Trump 's insistence that any new spending bill include somewhere around $ 5 billion for the construction of a border wall , barrier , or fence\u2014is built upon a foundation of sand . The president insists that `` there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border , '' but the evidence of that is scant .\nOver the past several years , including two during which the Republican Party controlled the White House and Congress and could have appropriated funds to build the wall that Candidate Trump promised in speech after speech ( usually claiming Mexico would pay the bill ) , there has been no mad rush or spike in people , especially terrorists , or drugs flowing north from Mexico that justify talk of crisis , especially one that can only be addressed by building physical barriers in the middle of nowhere .\nIndeed , the number of illegal immigrants in the country is at a 10-year low and the number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally between checkpoints on the Southern border is one-fourth of what it was in 2000 ( see chart ) . Compared to decades past , the majority of illegals enter the country legally and then overstay tourist , student , or work visas . In 2016 , the Department of Homeland Security said 170,000 people entered the country illegally outside of border checkpoints while 628,000 people who entered the country legally overstayed visas . Whether traveling alone or as a family , asylum seekers from Mexico , Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador offer themselves to authorities in order to start the application process and , even though are overwhelmingly likely to be denied asylum ( more on that in a moment ) , voluntarily show up for court dates between 83 percent and 99 percent of the time , according to government data .\nAs Cato 's Alex Nowratesh has documented , the terrorist risk posed by people crossing the Southern border is vanishingly small . Between 1975 and 2017 , 20 foreign-born terrorists entered the country either illegally or as asylees . `` [ Eleven ] terrorists who entered as asylum seekers murdered 9 people in terrorist attacks\u2026 . Of those 9 terrorists who entered illegally , only 3 did so along the border with Mexico . '' The perpetrators were ethnic Albanians from Macedonia who were brought here as children .\nTo the extent that drugs , especially heroin and fentanyl , flow north , they overwhelmingly enter the country by being smuggled through legal checkpoints . Building walls or fences is n't going to stop that . Nor will lying about the number of terrorists supposedly caught at the border , as White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did recently . She claimed , against all evidence , that the government had caught 4,000 `` known or suspected terrorists '' on the Southern border in 2017 ; in fact , six would-be immigrants were snagged .\nAnd yet respectable leading Republicans ( no , not you , Rep. Steve King ) such as Sens . Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) and Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) insist , like the president , that we are suddenly so deep in crisis nothing short of a wall can fix it . Not long ago , both were Tea Party darlings whose emphasis was on reducing the size , scope , and spending of government across the board . Though both voted for a short-term spending bill in December that did n't include wall funding , they now agree that the government should not reopen until Trump gets his money .\nIn 2010 , I remember hearing Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , give a speech at a Club for Growth event that raised the hair on the back of my neck because it was so emotionally powerful . He explicitly spoke not just to the wealthy grandees in the dinner hall that night but to the mostly Latino wait staff who lined the back of the room . America , he said , was a land of opportunity that has prospered materially and morally to the extent that we have been open to people coming here to work hard and pursue happiness . The future of his Republican Party , I remember him saying , depended on reaching out to newcomer immigrants and making it clear that they , like his parents , were welcome participants in the American experiment .\nEarly on in his Senate career , Rubio was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight , a group of senators who crafted comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to legalization for currently illegal immigrants , streamlined and expanded visas programs for both high-skill and low-skill workers , and various security measures , including increased requirements for employers to verify worker status . The Gang of Eight plan was recognized as moderate and passed the Senate overwhelmingly in 2013 , by a vote of 68 to 32 . The Republican House , led by Speaker John Boehner , refused to vote on the measure and it died , taking with it Rubio 's commitment to immigration reform . Since that defeat\u2014and massive abuse from increasingly nativist Republican voters , commentators , and elected officials\u2014Rubio switched directions and fallen in line with restrictionists . He reversed his position on `` dreamers , '' young immigrants brought here illegally as children by their parents , and has rejected a path to legal status for them . And he is currently joining in the Trump administration 's demand for a wall as a precondition for reopening the government .\nThe new caravan forming in Honduras is proof that what is happening at the border is a crisis . Primarily a humanitarian one . Our porous border is luring more families with children to undertake a dangerous journey . Placing children in danger & overwhelming our asylum system . \u2014 Marco Rubio ( @ marcorubio ) January 12 , 2019\nIt 's nice to see that some humanity remains in Rubio\u2014he says the current `` crisis '' is `` primarily a humanitarian one '' \u2014but he is wrong to imply that something has changed in our border policies or large-scale immigration flows .\nIn fact , about 50 percent of all asylum claims between 2011 through 2016 were denied . The denial rates are far , far higher than average for people from countries that are causing so much anxiety now . Over that time period , 90 percent of asylum claims for applicants from Mexico were denied and similarly long odds were faced by Salvadorans ( 83 percent denied ) , Hondurans ( 80 percent ) , and Guatemalans ( 77 percent ) . To the extent that the number of people , particularly families , applying for asylum has increased , that 's primarily driven by events in home countries , not changes in our immigration policies . Since 2016 , no one inside or outside of the United States is under the impression that we are rolling out the red carpet for the world 's wretched refuse . Indeed , President Trump has tightened up asylum rules so that those presenting themselves at the border are even less likely to be approved . If the recent deaths of migrant children have highlighted problems with Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) , those problems date back to well before Donald Trump took office . They constitute not a crisis to be solved by a border wall or the declaration of a national emergency but better oversight and better use of either existing or increased resources .\nFor his part , Ted Cruz has reintroduced his `` El Chapo Act , '' which\nwould reserve any amounts forfeited to the U.S. Government as a result of the criminal prosecution of `` El Chapo '' ( formally named Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Lorea ) and other drug lords for border security assets and the completion of the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border\u2026 Currently the U.S. Government is seeking the criminal forfeiture of more than $ 14 billion in drug proceeds and illicit profits from El Chapo , the former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel who was extradited to the U.S. to face criminal prosecution for numerous alleged drug-related crimes , including conspiracy to commit murder and money laundering .\nCruz has released a video , complete with animated graphics , to explain how this all would work .\nWhatever else you can say about Cruz 's video , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) is emphatic that virtually all heroin and fentanyl enters the country through legal checkpoints . In its most recent Drug Threat Assessment , the agency says ,\nA small percentage of all heroin seized by [ Customs & Border Patrol ] along the land border was between Ports of Entry ( POEs ) \u2026 . The majority of the flow is through [ privately owned vehicles ] entering the United States at legal ports of entry , followed by tractor-trailers , where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods .\nDonald Trump 's insistence that there is a crisis on the border between the United States and Mexico has won over more than Rubio and Cruz . Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-Tenn. ) , the leader of the so-called Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives , has gone on the record calling for extraordinary measures , including the use of asset forfeiture and a national emergency to build the president 's wall :\nDemocrats continue to refuse to negotiate in good faith or appropriate any money for border barriers . If they wo n't compromise , POTUS should use asset forfeiture money or other discretionary fees to start construction . If not , he should declare a national emergency . It 's time . \u2014 Mark Meadows ( @ RepMarkMeadows ) January 11 , 2019\nThe Freedom Caucus was founded in 2015 and its mission statement reads in part :\nThe House Freedom Caucus gives a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them . We support open , accountable and limited government , the Constitution and the rule of law , and policies that promote the liberty , safety and prosperity of all Americans .\nThere is evidence that Trump 's insistence both on a border crisis and the need for a wall is slowly wearing down opposition , especially given the uncomfortable fact that leading Democrats such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( Calif. ) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer ( N.Y. ) have voted for barriers in recent memory and they continue to speak the language of increasing `` border security . '' Although Trump continues to have historically low approval ratings , support for a wall has actually risen slightly over the past six months or so . Call it the art of the deal or whatever you want , but the guy wears people out until they give him what he wants .\nThis is the peculiar genius of Donald Trump , and it 's not trivial . More so than any other politician on the scene , he is able to set the terms of the national conversation . He may well `` lose '' the shutdown in the sense that he and the Republicans may suffer losses in 2020 or beyond . But there 's every \u2588\u2588\u2588 to believe that by the end of 2019 , some sort of groundbreaking will have begun on a wall ( or fence , or whatever ) designed to address a crisis that does n't exist .",
