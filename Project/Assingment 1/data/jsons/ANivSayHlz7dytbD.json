Here are three questions about this crucial procedural matter.\n\n1. How does impeachment begin?\n\nThe Constitution vests impeachment powers in the House of Representatives. Beyond that, the House votes on its own procedural rules. That leaves lots of room for interpretation and leeway for alternate beginnings.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is very clear about impeachment, but it is also not specific,\u201d says Matt Glassman, an expert on legislative procedure at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, in a recent podcast.\n\nIn the two presidential impeachments of the modern era, the House did have an official kickoff vote on a resolution authorizing the way ahead. That\u2019s important precedent, and could make voters and Republican officials view the process as more serious.\n\nBut House rules don\u2019t appear to require such a step. And it typically has not been used in impeachments of other officials, notably federal judges, which begin in the Judiciary Committee and go to the full House after the panel has completed its investigation.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment process may be initiated as the result of various actions and events, including the receipt and referral of information from an outside source, investigations by congressional committees under their general authority, or the introduction of articles of impeachment in the form of a House resolution,\u201d says a Congressional Research Service overview of current House impeachment rules.\n\n2. Why hasn\u2019t Speaker Pelosi put it to a vote?\n\nThere are both political and procedural reasons why Speaker Pelosi might not want to hold an impeachment-opening vote, or see it as necessary.\n\nDrawing up such a resolution would be both difficult and politically risky. Democrats might find themselves divided over what to include. Should impeachment focus only on President Trump\u2019s actions in regards to Ukraine, or should it refer back to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation or other controversial aspects of his presidency?\n\nWhile moderate Democrats may feel the party has been driven to impeachment by presidential actions, that does not mean they want to take any more votes on it than they have to.\n\nIn addition, House rules have changed.

Why are Republicans pressing the matter?\n\nThe White House has its own procedural and political reasons for demanding a vote \u2013 which mirror those of House Democrats.\n\nRepublicans may want an impeachment vote to provide subpoena power to the House minority. That would allow them to carry out a parallel investigation of the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine, or to call witnesses they feel could debunk charges made against President Trump.\n\nIn the Nixon and Clinton cases, the kickoff vote did provide such authority to minority members.
