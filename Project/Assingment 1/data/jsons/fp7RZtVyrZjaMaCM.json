    "content": "'Does It Have To Be Him ? ' : N.H. Progressives Split By Another Sanders Bid\nIn the spring of 2015 , before Bernie Sanders had a campaign office in New Hampshire , Elizabeth Ropp , an acupuncturist , was making homemade signs for the Vermont senator .\n`` Bernie inspired me because as somebody who 's lived without health insurance for most of my adult life , I want there to be a single-payer health care system , '' she said .\nShe was disappointed Sanders was n't the nominee and is convinced that if he had been , Donald Trump would not be president .\n`` I want to see Bernie run again in 2020 , '' said Ropp . `` We need Bernie to run even if the field is crowded . ''\nThe 77-year-old Vermont senator has not announced his plans , but he has sparked plenty of speculation .\nIn 2016 , Sanders created a powerful progressive movement in a thin primary field . The dilemma for him now is that nearly every other Democratic presidential contender is adopting his positions on issues like health care and minimum wage , which means progressive voters in 2020 have plenty of other choices .\nEarlier this month , when Sanders reintroduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , every Democrat in the Senate who 's rumored to be considering a run for president co-sponsored his legislation : Sherrod Brown , Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand , Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar .\n`` He has made it legitimate to talk about things that a lot of us used to mumble , '' said Arnie Arnesen , a radio show host and former New Hampshire politician who thinks of herself as Sanders ' ideological twin .\nArnesen says she 's grateful that he ran in 2016 because he helped `` expose some of the rot '' in her own party .\nSanders has helped change the Democratic National Committee rules for selecting a nominee , curtailing the role of superdelegates and shaped the current Democratic economic message . But Arnesen wonders whether he 's the right candidate for the White House .\n`` My question is , does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020 ? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages ? '' asked Arnesen , before answering her own question .\n`` Does it have to be him ? I do n't think it does , and I admire him . I admire him to pieces . ''\nThe clearest example of the change is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee so she could endorse Sanders in the 2016 primary . Gabbard recently launched her own presidential bid .\nSanders ' first decisive victory in 2016 came in the New Hampshire primary ; he crushed Hillary Clinton there by 22 percentage points . And activists like Andru Volinsky were part of the reason he did so well .\nVolinsky , Sanders ' New Hampshire campaign lawyer during the 2016 primary , said that if the Vermont senator were to run for president again , he would be his top choice .\nBut it 's unclear whether Volinsky personally wants Sanders to run .\n`` I want a strong advocate for addressing issues like income inequality and health care access and climate action , '' said Volinsky . `` Sen. Sanders could be that strong voice . There are some others that could as well . ''\nMany voters who strongly backed Sanders in 2016 say they realize Sanders is not necessarily the only progressive option in 2020 . For some , that 's confusing , but for others , it 's appealing .\nArnesen is excited by many of the candidates considering a run for the presidency ; many of them , she believes , carry elements of Sanders ' message .\nFor example , Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown , she says , has a lot of the same `` authenticity '' as Sanders `` without being 80 years old '' when he 's elected ( Sanders turns 79 in 2020 ) .\n`` I think it 's time for us to start creating a new bench , '' said Arnesen . `` And the new bench is n't old , it should n't be white , and it probably should n't be male . ''\nSome Sanders supporters also say the political environment has changed since 2016 and they want a candidate who can win .\n`` Electability has leaped to the forefront for me , '' said Ron Abramson , an immigration lawyer who served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC . `` I am prepared to support anyone who can help restore some measure of sanity [ and ] humanity . ''\n`` We 're looking for somebody right now who can stand up to the nasty , nasty campaign that our idiot-in-chief the president is gon na run in 2020 , '' said Bill Stelling , an activist who runs an art gallery in Manchester .\nStelling is not convinced Sanders is the right person for that job .\nEven though he was `` hugely inspired '' by Sanders ' message in 2016 and donated to the Vermont senator 's campaign , these days , he 's impressed with California Sen. Kamala Harris ; he thinks she 's `` fearless . ''\nHe 's also intrigued by Beto O'Rourke , the former Texas congressman who tried to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year . This week , Stelling is going to a `` Draft Beto '' house party . He wanted to spread the word , so he posted a note about the meeting on Facebook but was disheartened by the response .\n`` I immediately got some snarky comments from progressives , '' said Stelling . `` It 's so counterproductive . ''\nBut loyal Sanders supporters are unyielding in their devotion to the Vermont senator , because , they insist , he is the only one pushing the Democratic Party to the left .\n`` The other candidates are trying to posture themselves based on the assumption that Bernie Sanders is going to run , '' said Tim Smith , a four-term state legislator in Manchester and early Sanders supporter in the 2016 primary .\n`` They do n't want to be seen as being members of the conservative wing of the party .
