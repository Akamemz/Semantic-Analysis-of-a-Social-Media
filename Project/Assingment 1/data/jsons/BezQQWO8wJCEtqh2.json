As usual, the outline (which will be used to develop legislation) is full of promises for border security first, with a fix in the immigration system second. Here are the details:\n\nBorder Security and Interior Enforcement Must Come First\n\nIt is the fundamental duty of any government to secure its borders, and the United States is failing in this mission. We must secure our borders now and verify that they are secure. In addition, we must ensure now that when immigration reform is enacted, there will be a zero tolerance policy for those who cross the border illegally or overstay their visas in the future. Faced with a consistent pattern of administrations of both parties only selectively enforcing our nation\u2019s immigration laws, we must enact reform that ensures that a President cannot unilaterally stop immigration enforcement.\n\n\n\nImplement Entry-Exit Visa Tracking System\n\nA fully functioning Entry-Exit system has been mandated by eight separate statutes over the last 17 years. At least three of these laws call for this system to be biometric, using technology to verify identity and prevent fraud. We must implement this system so we can identify and track down visitors who abuse our laws.\n\n\n\nEmployment Verification and Workplace Enforcement\n\nIn the 21st century it is unacceptable that the majority of employees have their work eligibility verified through a paper based system wrought with fraud. It is past time for this country to fully implement a workable electronic employment verification system.\n\n\n\nReforms to the Legal Immigration System\n\nFor far too long, the United States has emphasized extended family members and pure luck over employment-based immigration. This is inconsistent with nearly every other developed country. Every year thousands of foreign nationals pursue degrees at America\u2019s colleges and universities, particularly in high skilled fields. Many of them want to use their expertise in U.S. industries that will spur economic growth and create jobs for Americans.

Of particular concern are the needs of the agricultural industry, among others. It is imperative that these temporary workers are able to meet the economic needs of the country and do not displace or disadvantage American workers.\n\n\n\nYouth\n\nOne of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who know no other place as home. For those who meet certain eligibility standards, and serve honorably in our military or attain a college degree, we will do just that.\n\n\n\nIndividuals Living Outside the Rule of Law\n\nOur national and economic security depend on requiring people who are living and working here illegally to come forward and get right with the law. There will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law.
