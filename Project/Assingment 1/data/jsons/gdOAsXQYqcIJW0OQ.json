For example , at Mar-a-Lago , the Secret Service was reportedly charged $ 650 per night dozens of times in 2017 , but was given a different and cheaper rate of $ 396.15 other times in 2018 .\nAnother staggering bill was reportedly presented to the Secret Service for the privilege of staying at the Trump National Golf Club at Bedminster , where it was charged $ 17,000 a month to use a cottage on the New Jersey property in 2017 . That \u2019 s several times above the standard rent in the area , and Trump was reportedly only there a third of the time during the billed month .\nNBC News previously reported , in June of last year , that the Trump International Hotel in Washington charged the Secret Service more than $ 200,000 in taxpayer money from September 2016 to February 2018 .
