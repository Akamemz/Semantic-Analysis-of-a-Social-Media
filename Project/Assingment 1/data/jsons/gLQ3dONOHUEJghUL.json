It has also claimed a July 2010 bombing of a Japanese oil tanker in the Persian Gulf and a 2005 rocket attack that narrowly missed a U.S. amphibious assault ship docked at Jordan 's Aqaba Red Sea resort .\nThe mid-morning blasts hit the upscale neighborhood of Janah , a Hezbollah stronghold , leaving bodies and pools of blood on the glass-strewn street amid burning cars .\nA Lebanese security official said the first suicide attacker was on a motorcycle that carried 4.4 pounds of explosives . He blew himself up at the large black main gate of the Iranian mission , damaging the three-story facility , the official said .\nLess than two minutes later , a second suicide attacker driving a car rigged with 110 pounds of explosives struck about 10 yards away , the official said . He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in line with regulations .\nThe bombing was one of the deadliest in a string of attacks that have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in recent months in a campaign of retaliation by Sunni radicals over its backing of Assad in Syria 's bloody conflict , now in its third year .\nIn recent weeks , Hezbollah fighters have backed Assad 's troops in a series of victories over rebels , taking back a string of rebel-held towns in Syria .
