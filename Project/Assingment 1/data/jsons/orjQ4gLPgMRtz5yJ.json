A less benign but utterly familiar possible reason is to put critics of the bill on their back foot , cast as defenders of the dismemberment of unborn children . Politicians and advocates of all kinds are adept at framing their side of a debate in terms that guarantee the maximum amount of awkwardness for any expression of dissent . The expression \u201c pro-choice \u201d as a label for supporters of the right to abortion was strategically adopted to counter the rhetorically powerful label \u201c pro-life. \u201d While the term \u201c pro-choice \u201d captured the morally central idea that each of us should be free to decide whether we become parents , it also abetted the gradual but substantial intrusion of state restrictions across the country into Americans \u2019 reproductive lives .
