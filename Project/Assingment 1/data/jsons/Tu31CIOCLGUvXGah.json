The pandemic might show the country that it shouldn \u2019 t be .\nPhotography by Caroline Tompkins Image above : Marielle Brenner , age 25 , in the living room of her parents \u2019 house in Melville , New York , in June . She moved back in with them after the economic fallout from the pandemic made her rent in Chicago unaffordable . For the most part , the pandemic has restricted motion in America . But one exception has been a large-scale nationwide reshuffling of humans between homes . Before the coronavirus came to the United States , many of the country \u2019 s young adults were working , studying , and building lives on their own . Now a great deal of them are back to living with their parents . The number of American adults who have returned to living at home is enormous . A recent analysis of government data by the real-estate website Zillow indicated that about 2.9 million adults moved in with a parent or grandparent in March , April , and May , if college students were included ; most of them were 25 or younger . Their sudden dispersal into their parents \u2019 homes is , for some , the result of the suspension of spring classes on college campuses and , for others , the result of miserable economic conditions . A survey from the Pew Research Center in March found that the younger an American adult is , the more likely that the pandemic has deprived them or someone in their household of work or earnings . Rent and other expenses got harder to cover , or simply to justify , for a large group of young people , so they moved home .\nBut focusing only on these explanations obscures a larger trend line . From the mid-1980s until the late 2000s , the share of 25-to-34-year-olds living at home hovered in the range of 10 to 12 percent , according to Census Bureau data . That figure did start to rise when the Great Recession began , but it continued to climb well after the recession was over . It hit 13 percent in 2010 , 15 percent in 2015 , and nearly 17 percent in 2018 . At the end of the 2010s , roughly 2 million more Americans in the 25-to-34 age group were living with their parents than at the beginning of the decade . That suggests that , independent of the Great Recession , something broader has changed in how people embark on their adult lives . \u201c More people are in education longer , and people marry and have their first child later than ever , \u201d Jeffrey Jensen Arnett , a psychology professor at Clark University , told me . \u201c You put those two things together , and you have more people either remaining home or moving back home than was true 40 or 50 years ago. \u201d Arnett came up with the label emerging adulthood for the open-ended developmental stage lasting roughly from age 18 to 29 , and wrote a book of the same name . ( Arsh Raziuddin / \u2588\u2588\u2588 ; Data : Census Bureau ) The rising median age of marriage can be partly explained by the rise in nonmarital cohabitation among romantic partners , as well as by the fact that for many couples , marriage has become \u201c a trophy \u201d \u2014a rite that marks the completion of the early stages of adulthood , rather than the beginning of them . Meanwhile , the widespread availability of birth control gives couples more agency in electing to postpone parenthood . These trends add up to a longer period in many young people \u2019 s lives when they aren \u2019 t living with a partner or children , and thus might continue living with their parents .\nThe second large-scale shift has to do with education\u2014or really , with the way education prepares people for their working life . As the economy has tilted over the past several decades toward knowledge-based work , people with only a high-school degree have fewer pathways to financial stability . When this is the case , two things happen : Many young people spend more time in college or graduate school , and those who don \u2019 t pursue higher education can have trouble finding work that pays well enough for them to live independently . Both of these trends , Arnett said , steer more people back to their parents . But in general , those with a college degree are less likely to live at home than those without one , as are women , who tend to have more education and get married earlier than men ; meanwhile , Black and Hispanic young adults are more likely to live at home than white ones . Read : The false stereotypes about Millennials who live at home Karen Fingerman , a human-development and family-sciences professor at the University of Texas at Austin , noted an additional factor that might be at play : As the share of parents who are married has declined , more solo parents might opt to live with their own parents , so they can have help raising their kids . Meanwhile , another contributor to living at home doesn \u2019 t directly have to do with considerations like child care or education\u2014some families simply prefer to have multiple generations under the same roof . \u201c They co-reside because they want to , \u201d Fingerman told me .\nThose are the long-term forces that built up the large population of people living at home before the pandemic , and the pandemic has only added more ( as well as , it should be noted , harming young people who no longer can afford rent , but don \u2019 t have parents who can take them in ) . The current surge in young people moving home , Arnett said , is likely to be the largest since the Great Depression . In normal times , when people move in with their parents , their choice is typically planned out at least a little while in advance . But this spring , decisions about where to live were made \u201c in the midst of a crisis , \u201d Fingerman pointed out . \u201c There was no thought\u2014there was no , Gee , I want to live with my parents. \u201d The decision to move back out probably won \u2019 t be made so quickly . The high up-front costs of moving into a new apartment alone or with roommates , Fingerman said , might encourage people to stay put even when the threat of the pandemic wanes , especially if the economy is slow to recover . Read : The pandemic will cleave America in two Public-health crises aside , the rise in the share of young people living at home in the past decade and a half has coincided with an important development in family life . \u201c We were already shifting as a society toward stronger intergenerational bonds , \u201d Fingerman said , pointing to research indicating that today \u2019 s young adults are in more frequent contact with their parents , and receive more guidance from them on emotional and financial matters compared with young adults several decades ago . In general , Fingerman said these strengthened connections represent a rewarding , welcome shift . They bring new closeness , though they can also bring up old tensions .\nAs young people have settled into their parents \u2019 houses during the pandemic , one difficulty has been navigating a shared physical space . \u201c One thing I \u2019 ve been dedicating some time to in quarantine is learning how to play the drums , \u201d Fletcher Lowe , a 22-year-old new college graduate who recently moved back in with his family in Tulsa , Oklahoma , told me . \u201c I bought an electronic drum kit a few weeks ago . I \u2019 m trying to be sensitive to the fact that I \u2019 m inhabiting a house . But the thing is , even with a plastic drum kit , it \u2019 s still going to make a lot of noise because you \u2019 re hitting it quite hard. \u201d In the course of reporting this article , I spoke with a 21-year-old in Colorado who has been sleeping on a futon in the living room of a two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother and grandmother ( \u201c It \u2019 s cramped , to be honest \u201d ) ; a 21-year-old in Virginia who felt constricted by reverting to a twin-size bed ( \u201c It \u2019 s not sustainable \u201d ) ; and an 18-year-old in Missouri who was limiting his daily trips out of the basement for snack retrieval , so as not to disturb his parents while they made work calls near the kitchen ( \u201c I just have to be careful now when I go upstairs \u201d ) .\nParents \u2019 homes do have their charms , though . Eric Rivera , a 30-year-old in Brooklyn who moved in with his parents in New Jersey last weekend , has been looking forward to \u201c weirdly enough , having a dishwasher and laundry\u2014all these things that we don \u2019 t normally have in New York City. \u201d Marielle Brenner , a 25-year-old who recently relocated from Chicago to her parents \u2019 house on Long Island , is pleased to regain access to a backyard . Read : Revenge of the suburbs This mix of inconveniences and luxuries forms the physical backdrop for a bigger drama\u2014the sometimes fraught , sometimes liberating renegotiations of parent-child relationships , now that the child isn \u2019 t actually a child anymore . The pandemic has interrupted many young people \u2019 s sense of progress by forcing them to move home . During emerging adulthood , Arnett told me , young people lay the groundwork for the rest of their adult lives and generally aim to \u201c get liftoff. \u201d \u201c The crisis throws a wrench into whatever you were doing , whether it \u2019 s work or school , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s got to be deflating. \u201d Before the pandemic , Chrissy Walker and her roommates in New York came up with a slogan for the year : \u201c 2020 : Our year for sure. \u201d This motto was intended to guide Walker , 22 years old and less than a year out of college , and her roommates as they scouted out new apartments , plotted career moves , and planned vacations during this exciting new post-college phase of their life . The slogan didn \u2019 t age well : Walker is now living at home with her parents in a suburb of Austin , Texas . \u201c It just feels like you \u2019 re being jerked around , like you didn \u2019 t get a full start at things , \u201d she told me .\nRivera , the 30-year-old who just moved back to New Jersey , is further along in adulthood , but had a similar feeling . His vision for the next few years was to continue advancing his career in tech-industry communications ; move out of his shared apartment and get a place of his own ; and \u201c buy furniture that \u2019 s not from Wayfair\u2014kind of these bigger steps that symbolize being more of an adult. \u201d But he was laid off in March , which led him to leave that shared apartment and move in with his parents for at least the rest of the year . A move home is an interruption for parents too . They \u2019 ve generally entered a phase in which , with their kids out of the house , \u201c they get to turn back to their own lives after a 20-or-so-year hiatus , \u201d Arnett said . Pandemic or not , having a child in the house again upsets their rhythms and impinges on their newly regained freedoms . \u201c Wherever we want to go , we go , \u201d Peter Walker , Chrissy \u2019 s father , who \u2019 s 55 , told me about what life was like after she went off to college . \u201c We work as long as we want to work . We go vacationing without consideration about whether Chrissy would like it or not. \u201d The pandemic has taken him out of a phase of life that was just as independent as the one his daughter was in . Read : It \u2019 s okay to be a different kind of parent during the pandemic Chrissy and her parents \u2019 tastes and habits have occasionally collided since her move back home . For instance , Chrissy would often get hungry at night and , as she \u2019 d been doing regularly while living on her own , cook some food for herself at 10:30 or 11 p.m. , which was a bother to her parents as they were going to bed . ( In Peter \u2019 s telling , it was more like midnight . ) \u201c It became this huge thing , a giant tiff , for two days , about me [ wanting to ] eat after 10:30 and them wanting to go to bed , \u201d Chrissy said . \u201c The sentiment was like , \u2018 You \u2019 re our kid in our house ; these are our rules , \u2019 and it , to me , was like , \u2018 Well , I \u2019 m not a kid , and I didn \u2019 t really ask to be in your house right now . \u2019 \u201d\nThere is a danger , Arnett said , that after a move back home , parents and children will lapse into their old roles . But at the same time , as adults , all parties have an opportunity to rewrite those roles . Indeed , the late-night-snacking conflict was resolved\u2014Chrissy started eating earlier . But some tensions are much less easily dealt with . Jordan , a 23-year-old recent college graduate in rural North Carolina , came out to their parents as nonbinary last year , and recently moved home after being unable to find work because of the pandemic . \u201c My parents have come a long way in loving and supporting the LGBTQ+ community , but they still don \u2019 t use my pronouns all the time , \u201d Jordan told me in an email . They said they were considering , \u201c half as a joke but also half-serious , \u201d putting up a poster on their bedroom door indicating their pronouns . ( They asked that I not publish their last name , in order to avoid harassment . ) To some , the gaps between who they were when they left home and who they are now can feel unbridgeable . \u201c I \u2019 ve used this time away from my family [ to accept ] my sexuality and political and philosophical beliefs , [ most of which are different from theirs ] , \u201d Tiara Primus , a recent graduate of Southern Oregon University , told me when I asked her near the end of her senior year about the prospect of moving back in with her parents . \u201c Going back home would mean dumping all of that in a bag and hiding it in the closet. \u201d ( She \u2019 s currently living in a city not far from campus , in her friend \u2019 s mother \u2019 s home . )\nSome of the regression to old family dynamics can be pleasurable , though . \u201c I watch the news with my mom a lot , \u201d Fletcher Lowe , the aspiring drummer , said . \u201c That \u2019 s something I did in high school . It \u2019 s kind of nice , the little routines that are reentering my life that haven \u2019 t been there for a while. \u201d Indeed , living at home doesn \u2019 t seem to harm most parent-child relationships . A 2011 Pew survey of 25-to-34-year-olds who lived at home found that about half of them said doing so had no effect on their relationship with their parents ; the remaining half was split almost evenly between those who said their relationships had gotten better and those who said their relationships had gotten worse . In emerging adulthood , people \u201c generally get along really well with their parents , much better than they did as adolescents , \u201d Arnett said , referencing hundreds of interviews he \u2019 s done with 18-to-29-year-olds and their parents over the years . \u201c The overwhelming consensus is , Man , we \u2019 re glad adolescence is over , because that was a contentious time. \u201d This opens up the possibility of wider-ranging conversations and deeper connection . Whereas teens are prone to hiding parts of themselves from their parents , Arnett said , emerging adults are usually more forthcoming . \u201c It \u2019 s really gratifying to their parents , because parenting is a lot of work , \u201d he told me . Parents \u2019 attitude , in his experience is : \u201c Now the payoff finally comes . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s been a blessing , \u201d Peter Walker said of having his daughter back home . \u201c We get to connect and chat whenever we \u2019 d like. \u201d Living at home also allows siblings to bond . \u201c My sister was in sixth grade when I left for college , and now she \u2019 s entering 10th grade , \u201d Lowe said . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of growing up that happens between those four years , so getting to see her being a real person is really cool. \u201d When some young people move back home , they are also , like their parents , in the rewarding position of noting how their loved ones have matured . Whatever their family relationships might be like , young people who have moved home can struggle with the symbolism of no longer living independently . \u201c I was already clocking in for the obligatory mid-20s existential crisis right before the pandemic started , \u201d Marielle Brenner told me . She is 25 and , until recently , was living in Chicago , working a job that didn \u2019 t inspire her or pay particularly well . She had student-loan debt and started cat-sitting to supplement her income . Her parents\u2014who live in Melville , New York\u2014raised the possibility of her moving home . \u201c I was very resistant to that , just because of the idea that \u2019 s been ingrained in so many young Millennials that moving home with your parents is a step back , \u201d she told me . \u201c It \u2019 s the ideal to be self-sufficient and live on your own , have your own place , have a successful job . \u201d\nWhen the pandemic forced many businesses to close this spring , Brenner \u2019 s roommate lost his source of income and had to move out . Unable to afford the rent on her own , she reluctantly concluded that returning to Melville made the most sense financially . \u201c I never imagined living at home as a 25-year-old , \u201d she told me the day after she moved in . \u201c That sentence just feels like a failure. \u201d Many of the other young adults I \u2019 ve interviewed recently feel the same way about moving back in with their parents , even though they recognize that the circumstances that led them to do it were entirely beyond their control . Read : The misfortune of graduating in 2020 This feeling of failure is hard to shake , because it \u2019 s the product of cultural programming . According to 2015 data from the Census Bureau , some 82 percent of American adults think that moving out of one \u2019 s parents \u2019 house is a \u201c somewhat , \u201d \u201c quite , \u201d or \u201c extremely \u201d important component of entering adulthood . The median age that survey respondents identified for reaching this turning point was 21 , and yet less than half of 21-year-olds had actually reached it . Young people who don \u2019 t reach this milestone \u201c on time \u201d are often stigmatized . In 2005 , Time magazine ran a feature about \u201c young adults who live off their parents , bounce from job to job and hop from mate to mate , \u201d and put on its cover a picture of a young man in business-casual attire sitting in a child-size sandbox . \u201c What are they waiting for ? Who are these permanent adolescents , these twentysomething Peter Pans ? \u201d the story inside asked . \u201c And why can \u2019 t they grow up ? \u201d The article proposed a nickname for this generation whose exceeding clunkiness thankfully kept it from sticking around : \u201c Twixters , \u201d so named for the state of being \u201c betwixt and between . \u201d\nIn many places around the world , living at home doesn \u2019 t carry some of the associations it does in the U.S. Fingerman , the UT Austin professor , brought up the examples of Spain and Italy , which have high rates of adults living at home ; in Italy , for instance , 66.5 percent of 25-to-29-year-olds were living with their parents in 2018 . She said this may be related to the availability of housing in those countries , but it is also related to cultural values . \u201c They find the arrangement rewarding , they enjoy one another , and it \u2019 s part of their family life , \u201d she said . Plenty of people living in the U.S. find the arrangement rewarding too . Mor\u00e9na Espiritual , an artist and an educator in New York City who uses they/them pronouns and is in their 20s , has been living with their mother and , on and off , their grandmother since before the pandemic . Separately , Espiritual \u2019 s 33-year-old sister is married with two kids , and their 30-year-old brother has a partner ; all of those relatives share a home . \u201c My family is very focused on staying together to support each other , \u201d Espiritual told me . Espiritual feels like living with family expands their world rather than limiting it . \u201c I can still party ; I can still have [ meaningful ] conversations \u201d with peers , they said , \u201c but I \u2019 ll come back to my home , where also I have the perspective of people that are older than me. \u201d Their household and others like it expose the problems with the narrative that living at home is a failure . \u201c For me , specifically , and my family , being Dominican , and coming from a household of mostly Black and Indigenous people , the way we \u2019 ve been raised to relate to each other is more interdependent and communal , especially when most of your family are immigrants that arrive here and aren \u2019 t very aware of how to navigate American society , \u201d Espiritual said . \u201c People just learn how to establish and respect each other \u2019 s boundaries as they age , instead of moving away from each other. \u201d This philosophy of family life , Espiritual told me , is common among their friends in Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic and Colombia , many of whom are in their 20s and live at home .\nRead : The nuclear family was a mistake Espiritual thinks that many people confuse living independently with being mature . \u201c What does being grown mean ? Does living by yourself mean that you \u2019 re grown ? \u201d they said . \u201c Because I think I \u2019 ve learned how to better establish boundaries and communicate while living at home than some people who don \u2019 t. \u201d The conventional story about young people living at home misses that point . One could argue , as Espiritual effectively does , that the virtues of living at home have been swallowed up by popular middle-class American narratives about self-sufficiency and achievement . Discussions of young adults who live with their parents often focus on when they will leave , and what awaits them when they do , rather than what they can gain from life at home while there . Besides , the stigma associated with living at home is more grounded in the past than the present . \u201c Many people still hold the old normative expectations\u2014you \u2019 re \u2018 supposed to \u2019 become an adult by the time you \u2019 re 21 or 22\u2014and haven \u2019 t adjusted to the new reality , \u201d Arnett said . \u201c I think parents and grandparents often look at today \u2019 s emerging adults and think , Now , at their age I was doing X , Y , and Z , and they seem to be nowhere near doing those things . What \u2019 s wrong with them ? They are rather egocentrically applying the norms of their youth to today , when those aren \u2019 t the norms anymore. \u201d Today \u2019 s young people are coming of age in a new era but still being judged by the standards of a previous one . The economic system that has led so many of them to move home in the past 15 years may well deserve criticism , but their response to it is rational .\nIn the 21st century , a better way to think about living at home , Arnett told me , is that it is in many cases involuntary but rarely stunting . Since Arnett started studying this life stage nearly 30 years ago , he \u2019 s seen the stigma around living at home weaken . One cause of this shift , he thinks , is the immigration patterns of the past few decades . In interviewing the families of young adults , Arnett has noticed that many immigrants from Asia , Africa , and Latin America are accustomed to different norms around living at home , and thus hold a more positive view of it . For some parents , he told me , \u201c It \u2019 s more of a worry \u2026 if their kids move out in their 20s : Don \u2019 t they like their parents ? Why are they moving into an apartment half a mile away ? What \u2019 s wrong with that household ? \u201d Another reason is simply that , as living at home becomes more common , people adjust to it . \u201c It becomes more normal , \u201d he said . \u201c We shrug and get used to it. \u201d In fact , the pandemic might produce even more shrugging , and further update notions of what living at home symbolizes . \u201c There \u2019 s a thing that we sometimes call \u2018 cultural lag \u2019 \u2014society begins to change , but our cultural beliefs take a little longer to catch up , \u201d Fingerman told me . \u201c I think that was happening already , but with this big increase in the number of young adults who are going to be residing with their parents , and with a very clear explanation for why that occurred , I think the culture will shift , and people will very much consider this a normal pattern now. \u201d This change in attitude may well be helped along by the fact that this recent wave of people moving home was the result of a truly unforeseeable global catastrophe that affected even those with credentials for and careers in previously healthy industries .\nMarielle Brenner told me about the moment this spring when she let go of her opposition to moving home . She was videochatting with two friends on the West Coast . \u201c I don \u2019 t know why it didn \u2019 t click with me before , but they were like , \u2018 No one will blame you if you \u2019 re moving home right now with your parents , \u2019 \u201d she said . \u201c I guess it was them that made it okay for me to allow myself to consider that decision. \u201d That said , she wonders what people will think of living at home after the pandemic . \u201c If and when things get back to some sort of normal and unemployment goes down , \u201d she said , \u201c I have the fear that I will continue to stay here and it will be perceived as lazy. \u201d She has good reason to fear that . Writing in April in \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the sociologists Victor Tan Chen and Ofer Sharone predicted , based on their two decades of research on unemployed workers , that the initial phase of widespread \u201c solidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs \u201d because of the pandemic will be followed by a resurgence of \u201c the old stigmas against unemployed workers \u2026 as memories of the initial crisis fade and people find new reasons to fault others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. \u201d Public attitudes toward people who moved home during the pandemic could follow the same pattern : sympathy now , judgment later . ( Likewise , Arnett thinks that stereotypes about irresponsible young people are \u201c remarkably sturdy. \u201d ) But maybe , this time , people will really start to embrace the new timelines of emerging adulthood . \u201c More than ever , there \u2019 s no reason to hurry into adult life and set artificial deadlines , \u201d Arnett said . \u201c The norms for when you get married , have children , become fully employed , are a lot more relaxed than they used to be . Now we can use that to our advantage and take some of the pressure off. \u201d Maybe this unhurried and understanding mentality will be the one that guides the people currently living at home when , 20 or 30 years from now , their own children are the ones doing the same .",
    "content_original": "Moving in with your parents is often seen as a mark of irresponsibility. The pandemic might show the country that it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\nPhotography by Caroline Tompkins Image above: Marielle Brenner, age 25, in the living room of her parents\u2019 house in Melville, New York, in June. She moved back in with them after the economic fallout from the pandemic made her rent in Chicago unaffordable. For the most part, the pandemic has restricted motion in America. But one exception has been a large-scale nationwide reshuffling of humans between homes. Before the coronavirus came to the United States, many of the country\u2019s young adults were working, studying, and building lives on their own. Now a great deal of them are back to living with their parents. The number of American adults who have returned to living at home is enormous. A recent analysis of government data by the real-estate website Zillow indicated that about 2.9 million adults moved in with a parent or grandparent in March, April, and May, if college students were included; most of them were 25 or younger. Their sudden dispersal into their parents\u2019 homes is, for some, the result of the suspension of spring classes on college campuses and, for others, the result of miserable economic conditions. A survey from the Pew Research Center in March found that the younger an American adult is, the more likely that the pandemic has deprived them or someone in their household of work or earnings. Rent and other expenses got harder to cover, or simply to justify, for a large group of young people, so they moved home.\n\nBut focusing only on these explanations obscures a larger trend line. From the mid-1980s until the late 2000s, the share of 25-to-34-year-olds living at home hovered in the range of 10 to 12 percent, according to Census Bureau data. That figure did start to rise when the Great Recession began, but it continued to climb well after the recession was over. It hit 13 percent in 2010, 15 percent in 2015, and nearly 17 percent in 2018. At the end of the 2010s, roughly 2 million more Americans in the 25-to-34 age group were living with their parents than at the beginning of the decade. That suggests that, independent of the Great Recession, something broader has changed in how people embark on their adult lives. \u201cMore people are in education longer, and people marry and have their first child later than ever,\u201d Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a psychology professor at Clark University, told me. \u201cYou put those two things together, and you have more people either remaining home or moving back home than was true 40 or 50 years ago.\u201d Arnett came up with the label emerging adulthood for the open-ended developmental stage lasting roughly from age 18 to 29, and wrote a book of the same name. (Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic; Data: Census Bureau) The rising median age of marriage can be partly explained by the rise in nonmarital cohabitation among romantic partners, as well as by the fact that for many couples, marriage has become \u201ca trophy\u201d\u2014a rite that marks the completion of the early stages of adulthood, rather than the beginning of them. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of birth control gives couples more agency in electing to postpone parenthood. These trends add up to a longer period in many young people\u2019s lives when they aren\u2019t living with a partner or children, and thus might continue living with their parents.\n\nThe second large-scale shift has to do with education\u2014or really, with the way education prepares people for their working life. As the economy has tilted over the past several decades toward knowledge-based work, people with only a high-school degree have fewer pathways to financial stability. When this is the case, two things happen: Many young people spend more time in college or graduate school, and those who don\u2019t pursue higher education can have trouble finding work that pays well enough for them to live independently. Both of these trends, Arnett said, steer more people back to their parents. But in general, those with a college degree are less likely to live at home than those without one, as are women, who tend to have more education and get married earlier than men; meanwhile, Black and Hispanic young adults are more likely to live at home than white ones. Read: The false stereotypes about Millennials who live at home Karen Fingerman, a human-development and family-sciences professor at the University of Texas at Austin, noted an additional factor that might be at play: As the share of parents who are married has declined, more solo parents might opt to live with their own parents, so they can have help raising their kids. Meanwhile, another contributor to living at home doesn\u2019t directly have to do with considerations like child care or education\u2014some families simply prefer to have multiple generations under the same roof. \u201cThey co-reside because they want to,\u201d Fingerman told me.\n\nThose are the long-term forces that built up the large population of people living at home before the pandemic, and the pandemic has only added more (as well as, it should be noted, harming young people who no longer can afford rent, but don\u2019t have parents who can take them in). The current surge in young people moving home, Arnett said, is likely to be the largest since the Great Depression. In normal times, when people move in with their parents, their choice is typically planned out at least a little while in advance. But this spring, decisions about where to live were made \u201cin the midst of a crisis,\u201d Fingerman pointed out. \u201cThere was no thought\u2014there was no, Gee, I want to live with my parents.\u201d The decision to move back out probably won\u2019t be made so quickly. The high up-front costs of moving into a new apartment alone or with roommates, Fingerman said, might encourage people to stay put even when the threat of the pandemic wanes, especially if the economy is slow to recover. Read: The pandemic will cleave America in two Public-health crises aside, the rise in the share of young people living at home in the past decade and a half has coincided with an important development in family life. \u201cWe were already shifting as a society toward stronger intergenerational bonds,\u201d Fingerman said, pointing to research indicating that today\u2019s young adults are in more frequent contact with their parents, and receive more guidance from them on emotional and financial matters compared with young adults several decades ago. In general, Fingerman said these strengthened connections represent a rewarding, welcome shift. They bring new closeness, though they can also bring up old tensions.\n\nAs young people have settled into their parents\u2019 houses during the pandemic, one difficulty has been navigating a shared physical space. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been dedicating some time to in quarantine is learning how to play the drums,\u201d Fletcher Lowe, a 22-year-old new college graduate who recently moved back in with his family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told me. \u201cI bought an electronic drum kit a few weeks ago. I\u2019m trying to be sensitive to the fact that I\u2019m inhabiting a house. But the thing is, even with a plastic drum kit, it\u2019s still going to make a lot of noise because you\u2019re hitting it quite hard.\u201d In the course of reporting this article, I spoke with a 21-year-old in Colorado who has been sleeping on a futon in the living room of a two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother and grandmother (\u201cIt\u2019s cramped, to be honest\u201d); a 21-year-old in Virginia who felt constricted by reverting to a twin-size bed (\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable\u201d); and an 18-year-old in Missouri who was limiting his daily trips out of the basement for snack retrieval, so as not to disturb his parents while they made work calls near the kitchen (\u201cI just have to be careful now when I go upstairs\u201d).\n\nParents\u2019 homes do have their charms, though. Eric Rivera, a 30-year-old in Brooklyn who moved in with his parents in New Jersey last weekend, has been looking forward to \u201cweirdly enough, having a dishwasher and laundry\u2014all these things that we don\u2019t normally have in New York City.\u201d Marielle Brenner, a 25-year-old who recently relocated from Chicago to her parents\u2019 house on Long Island, is pleased to regain access to a backyard. Read: Revenge of the suburbs This mix of inconveniences and luxuries forms the physical backdrop for a bigger drama\u2014the sometimes fraught, sometimes liberating renegotiations of parent-child relationships, now that the child isn\u2019t actually a child anymore. The pandemic has interrupted many young people\u2019s sense of progress by forcing them to move home. During emerging adulthood, Arnett told me, young people lay the groundwork for the rest of their adult lives and generally aim to \u201cget liftoff.\u201d \u201cThe crisis throws a wrench into whatever you were doing, whether it\u2019s work or school,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be deflating.\u201d Before the pandemic, Chrissy Walker and her roommates in New York came up with a slogan for the year: \u201c2020: Our year for sure.\u201d This motto was intended to guide Walker, 22 years old and less than a year out of college, and her roommates as they scouted out new apartments, plotted career moves, and planned vacations during this exciting new post-college phase of their life. The slogan didn\u2019t age well: Walker is now living at home with her parents in a suburb of Austin, Texas. \u201cIt just feels like you\u2019re being jerked around, like you didn\u2019t get a full start at things,\u201d she told me.\n\nRivera, the 30-year-old who just moved back to New Jersey, is further along in adulthood, but had a similar feeling. His vision for the next few years was to continue advancing his career in tech-industry communications; move out of his shared apartment and get a place of his own; and \u201cbuy furniture that\u2019s not from Wayfair\u2014kind of these bigger steps that symbolize being more of an adult.\u201d But he was laid off in March, which led him to leave that shared apartment and move in with his parents for at least the rest of the year. A move home is an interruption for parents too. They\u2019ve generally entered a phase in which, with their kids out of the house, \u201cthey get to turn back to their own lives after a 20-or-so-year hiatus,\u201d Arnett said. Pandemic or not, having a child in the house again upsets their rhythms and impinges on their newly regained freedoms. \u201cWherever we want to go, we go,\u201d Peter Walker, Chrissy\u2019s father, who\u2019s 55, told me about what life was like after she went off to college. \u201cWe work as long as we want to work. We go vacationing without consideration about whether Chrissy would like it or not.\u201d The pandemic has taken him out of a phase of life that was just as independent as the one his daughter was in. Read: It\u2019s okay to be a different kind of parent during the pandemic Chrissy and her parents\u2019 tastes and habits have occasionally collided since her move back home. For instance, Chrissy would often get hungry at night and, as she\u2019d been doing regularly while living on her own, cook some food for herself at 10:30 or 11 p.m., which was a bother to her parents as they were going to bed. (In Peter\u2019s telling, it was more like midnight.) \u201cIt became this huge thing, a giant tiff, for two days, about me [wanting to] eat after 10:30 and them wanting to go to bed,\u201d Chrissy said. \u201cThe sentiment was like, \u2018You\u2019re our kid in our house; these are our rules,\u2019 and it, to me, was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not a kid, and I didn\u2019t really ask to be in your house right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is a danger, Arnett said, that after a move back home, parents and children will lapse into their old roles. But at the same time, as adults, all parties have an opportunity to rewrite those roles. Indeed, the late-night-snacking conflict was resolved\u2014Chrissy started eating earlier. But some tensions are much less easily dealt with. Jordan, a 23-year-old recent college graduate in rural North Carolina, came out to their parents as nonbinary last year, and recently moved home after being unable to find work because of the pandemic. \u201cMy parents have come a long way in loving and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, but they still don\u2019t use my pronouns all the time,\u201d Jordan told me in an email. They said they were considering, \u201chalf as a joke but also half-serious,\u201d putting up a poster on their bedroom door indicating their pronouns. (They asked that I not publish their last name, in order to avoid harassment.) To some, the gaps between who they were when they left home and who they are now can feel unbridgeable. \u201cI\u2019ve used this time away from my family [to accept] my sexuality and political and philosophical beliefs, [most of which are different from theirs],\u201d Tiara Primus, a recent graduate of Southern Oregon University, told me when I asked her near the end of her senior year about the prospect of moving back in with her parents. \u201cGoing back home would mean dumping all of that in a bag and hiding it in the closet.\u201d (She\u2019s currently living in a city not far from campus, in her friend\u2019s mother\u2019s home.)\n\nSome of the regression to old family dynamics can be pleasurable, though. \u201cI watch the news with my mom a lot,\u201d Fletcher Lowe, the aspiring drummer, said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I did in high school. It\u2019s kind of nice, the little routines that are reentering my life that haven\u2019t been there for a while.\u201d Indeed, living at home doesn\u2019t seem to harm most parent-child relationships. A 2011 Pew survey of 25-to-34-year-olds who lived at home found that about half of them said doing so had no effect on their relationship with their parents; the remaining half was split almost evenly between those who said their relationships had gotten better and those who said their relationships had gotten worse. In emerging adulthood, people \u201cgenerally get along really well with their parents, much better than they did as adolescents,\u201d Arnett said, referencing hundreds of interviews he\u2019s done with 18-to-29-year-olds and their parents over the years. \u201cThe overwhelming consensus is, Man, we\u2019re glad adolescence is over, because that was a contentious time.\u201d This opens up the possibility of wider-ranging conversations and deeper connection. Whereas teens are prone to hiding parts of themselves from their parents, Arnett said, emerging adults are usually more forthcoming. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to their parents, because parenting is a lot of work,\u201d he told me. Parents\u2019 attitude, in his experience is: \u201cNow the payoff finally comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing,\u201d Peter Walker said of having his daughter back home. \u201cWe get to connect and chat whenever we\u2019d like.\u201d Living at home also allows siblings to bond. \u201cMy sister was in sixth grade when I left for college, and now she\u2019s entering 10th grade,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of growing up that happens between those four years, so getting to see her being a real person is really cool.\u201d When some young people move back home, they are also, like their parents, in the rewarding position of noting how their loved ones have matured. Whatever their family relationships might be like, young people who have moved home can struggle with the symbolism of no longer living independently. \u201cI was already clocking in for the obligatory mid-20s existential crisis right before the pandemic started,\u201d Marielle Brenner told me. She is 25 and, until recently, was living in Chicago, working a job that didn\u2019t inspire her or pay particularly well. She had student-loan debt and started cat-sitting to supplement her income. Her parents\u2014who live in Melville, New York\u2014raised the possibility of her moving home. \u201cI was very resistant to that, just because of the idea that\u2019s been ingrained in so many young Millennials that moving home with your parents is a step back,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the ideal to be self-sufficient and live on your own, have your own place, have a successful job.\u201d\n\nWhen the pandemic forced many businesses to close this spring, Brenner\u2019s roommate lost his source of income and had to move out. Unable to afford the rent on her own, she reluctantly concluded that returning to Melville made the most sense financially. \u201cI never imagined living at home as a 25-year-old,\u201d she told me the day after she moved in. \u201cThat sentence just feels like a failure.\u201d Many of the other young adults I\u2019ve interviewed recently feel the same way about moving back in with their parents, even though they recognize that the circumstances that led them to do it were entirely beyond their control. Read: The misfortune of graduating in 2020 This feeling of failure is hard to shake, because it\u2019s the product of cultural programming. According to 2015 data from the Census Bureau, some 82 percent of American adults think that moving out of one\u2019s parents\u2019 house is a \u201csomewhat,\u201d \u201cquite,\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d important component of entering adulthood. The median age that survey respondents identified for reaching this turning point was 21, and yet less than half of 21-year-olds had actually reached it. Young people who don\u2019t reach this milestone \u201con time\u201d are often stigmatized. In 2005, Time magazine ran a feature about \u201cyoung adults who live off their parents, bounce from job to job and hop from mate to mate,\u201d and put on its cover a picture of a young man in business-casual attire sitting in a child-size sandbox. \u201cWhat are they waiting for? Who are these permanent adolescents, these twentysomething Peter Pans?\u201d the story inside asked. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t they grow up?\u201d The article proposed a nickname for this generation whose exceeding clunkiness thankfully kept it from sticking around: \u201cTwixters,\u201d so named for the state of being \u201cbetwixt and between.\u201d\n\nIn many places around the world, living at home doesn\u2019t carry some of the associations it does in the U.S. Fingerman, the UT Austin professor, brought up the examples of Spain and Italy, which have high rates of adults living at home; in Italy, for instance, 66.5 percent of 25-to-29-year-olds were living with their parents in 2018. She said this may be related to the availability of housing in those countries, but it is also related to cultural values. \u201cThey find the arrangement rewarding, they enjoy one another, and it\u2019s part of their family life,\u201d she said. Plenty of people living in the U.S. find the arrangement rewarding too. Mor\u00e9na Espiritual, an artist and an educator in New York City who uses they/them pronouns and is in their 20s, has been living with their mother and, on and off, their grandmother since before the pandemic. Separately, Espiritual\u2019s 33-year-old sister is married with two kids, and their 30-year-old brother has a partner; all of those relatives share a home. \u201cMy family is very focused on staying together to support each other,\u201d Espiritual told me. Espiritual feels like living with family expands their world rather than limiting it. \u201cI can still party; I can still have [meaningful] conversations\u201d with peers, they said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll come back to my home, where also I have the perspective of people that are older than me.\u201d Their household and others like it expose the problems with the narrative that living at home is a failure. \u201cFor me, specifically, and my family, being Dominican, and coming from a household of mostly Black and Indigenous people, the way we\u2019ve been raised to relate to each other is more interdependent and communal, especially when most of your family are immigrants that arrive here and aren\u2019t very aware of how to navigate American society,\u201d Espiritual said. \u201cPeople just learn how to establish and respect each other\u2019s boundaries as they age, instead of moving away from each other.\u201d This philosophy of family life, Espiritual told me, is common among their friends in Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic and Colombia, many of whom are in their 20s and live at home.\n\nRead: The nuclear family was a mistake Espiritual thinks that many people confuse living independently with being mature. \u201cWhat does being grown mean? Does living by yourself mean that you\u2019re grown?\u201d they said. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ve learned how to better establish boundaries and communicate while living at home than some people who don\u2019t.\u201d The conventional story about young people living at home misses that point. One could argue, as Espiritual effectively does, that the virtues of living at home have been swallowed up by popular middle-class American narratives about self-sufficiency and achievement. Discussions of young adults who live with their parents often focus on when they will leave, and what awaits them when they do, rather than what they can gain from life at home while there. Besides, the stigma associated with living at home is more grounded in the past than the present. \u201cMany people still hold the old normative expectations\u2014you\u2019re \u2018supposed to\u2019 become an adult by the time you\u2019re 21 or 22\u2014and haven\u2019t adjusted to the new reality,\u201d Arnett said. \u201cI think parents and grandparents often look at today\u2019s emerging adults and think, Now, at their age I was doing X, Y, and Z, and they seem to be nowhere near doing those things. What\u2019s wrong with them? They are rather egocentrically applying the norms of their youth to today, when those aren\u2019t the norms anymore.\u201d Today\u2019s young people are coming of age in a new era but still being judged by the standards of a previous one. The economic system that has led so many of them to move home in the past 15 years may well deserve criticism, but their response to it is rational.\n\nIn the 21st century, a better way to think about living at home, Arnett told me, is that it is in many cases involuntary but rarely stunting. Since Arnett started studying this life stage nearly 30 years ago, he\u2019s seen the stigma around living at home weaken. One cause of this shift, he thinks, is the immigration patterns of the past few decades. In interviewing the families of young adults, Arnett has noticed that many immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America are accustomed to different norms around living at home, and thus hold a more positive view of it. For some parents, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s more of a worry \u2026 if their kids move out in their 20s: Don\u2019t they like their parents? Why are they moving into an apartment half a mile away? What\u2019s wrong with that household?\u201d Another reason is simply that, as living at home becomes more common, people adjust to it. \u201cIt becomes more normal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shrug and get used to it.\u201d In fact, the pandemic might produce even more shrugging, and further update notions of what living at home symbolizes. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing that we sometimes call \u2018cultural lag\u2019\u2014society begins to change, but our cultural beliefs take a little longer to catch up,\u201d Fingerman told me. \u201cI think that was happening already, but with this big increase in the number of young adults who are going to be residing with their parents, and with a very clear explanation for why that occurred, I think the culture will shift, and people will very much consider this a normal pattern now.\u201d This change in attitude may well be helped along by the fact that this recent wave of people moving home was the result of a truly unforeseeable global catastrophe that affected even those with credentials for and careers in previously healthy industries.\n\nMarielle Brenner told me about the moment this spring when she let go of her opposition to moving home. She was videochatting with two friends on the West Coast. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t click with me before, but they were like, \u2018No one will blame you if you\u2019re moving home right now with your parents,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI guess it was them that made it okay for me to allow myself to consider that decision.\u201d That said, she wonders what people will think of living at home after the pandemic. \u201cIf and when things get back to some sort of normal and unemployment goes down,\u201d she said, \u201cI have the fear that I will continue to stay here and it will be perceived as lazy.\u201d She has good reason to fear that. Writing in April in The Atlantic, the sociologists Victor Tan Chen and Ofer Sharone predicted, based on their two decades of research on unemployed workers, that the initial phase of widespread \u201csolidarity and compassion for the millions who have lost their jobs\u201d because of the pandemic will be followed by a resurgence of \u201cthe old stigmas against unemployed workers \u2026 as memories of the initial crisis fade and people find new reasons to fault others for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.\u201d Public attitudes toward people who moved home during the pandemic could follow the same pattern: sympathy now, judgment later. (Likewise, Arnett thinks that stereotypes about irresponsible young people are \u201cremarkably sturdy.\u201d) But maybe, this time, people will really start to embrace the new timelines of emerging adulthood. \u201cMore than ever, there\u2019s no reason to hurry into adult life and set artificial deadlines,\u201d Arnett said. \u201cThe norms for when you get married, have children, become fully employed, are a lot more relaxed than they used to be. Now we can use that to our advantage and take some of the pressure off.\u201d Maybe this unhurried and understanding mentality will be the one that guides the people currently living at home when, 20 or 30 years from now, their own children are the ones doing the same.",
