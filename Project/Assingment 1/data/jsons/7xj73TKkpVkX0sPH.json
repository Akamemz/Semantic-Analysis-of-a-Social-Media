Meanwhile , the Senate is debating a bipartisan bill that , busting through gridlock , passed unanimously out of committee in April .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re going to have a law . Nobody \u2019 s gotten this far before , \u201d says Kati Haycock , president of The Education Trust . The group works to close opportunity and achievement gaps for disadvantaged children \u2013 which was the intent of the law to begin with .\nNot everyone shares her degree of optimism , especially considering the fierce lobbying that is pulling and tugging at both Republicans and Democrats . But even skeptics admit that several factors are at play that favor this attempt to reauthorize the law \u2013 which expired in 2007 , but is still in effect \u2013 over previous efforts that failed .\nThe first is the bipartisan Senate bill , carefully crafted by Sens . Lamar Alexander ( R ) of Tennessee and Patty Murray ( D ) of Washington . Earlier this year Senator Alexander , chair of the committee that hatched the bill , abandoned his approach of writing a GOP version \u2013 his prerogative as chairman \u2013 and heeded his Democratic colleague \u2019 s urging to work with her on a draft that could serve as a starting point for the committee .\nThat was \u201c good advice , \u201d Senator Alexander commented back in April .\nThe two reached a consensus . They would continue the law \u2019 s measurements of students \u2019 academic progress through required testing . But they would restore to states and communities the responsibility for deciding what to do about student achievement . That would relieve the anxiety that had generated even more tests to prepare for the required tests .\nThe Senate committee adopted their approach , with the understanding that the bill would be open to amendment once it hit the Senate floor \u2013 which is the process it \u2019 s going through now . It may well be that the Senate bill becomes the basis of whatever is eventually worked out in a conference between the two chambers .\nA second favorable factor is pressure from education leaders in the states . It \u2019 s a \u201c mishmash of a mess \u201d out there , says Ms. Haycock .\nTeachers , parents , and administrators rebelled against the explosion in testing and the accompanying requirement to make \u201c adequate yearly progress. \u201d When lawmakers failed to rewrite the law by 2011 , the Obama administration allowed for \u201c waivers \u201d to get out of it \u2013 but only if states agreed to reforms and found other ways to hold schools accountable . Now 42 states have waivers .\n\u201c So many Americans , they \u2019 re struggling under the situation we have right now , \u201d Rep. John Kline ( R ) of Minnesota , told reporters Wednesday . \u201c You can \u2019 t go to any state in the country and say : \u2018 Boy don \u2019 t you just love that No Child Left Behind ? \u2019 No . No . Everybody understands it \u2019 s a horribly flawed law and it has to be fixed , \u201d said Congressman Kline , who is shepherding the House bill .\nThe players , too , could prove the critical difference this time .\nSenator Alexander \u2013 a former governor , Education secretary , and president of a university \u2013 is a \u201c results \u201d oriented senator , determined to see this through . His partner in this effort , Senator Murray , is a former pre-school teacher and a skilled negotiator , having hammered out a bipartisan budget agreement in 2013 that steered the country away from shutdown threats .\nOn the House side , Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio was there at the birth of No Child Left Behind , midwifing the law with the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts . He has left the repair job in the hands of Kline , chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee . Like Alexander , Kline , too , seems determined to replace No Child Left Behind with something better .\nKline came under fierce criticism from Democrats for not holding a single hearing on the bill ( hearings were held in previous years ) , and for the party-line vote out of committee . Earlier this year , the bill was paused on the House floor when a more urgent matter intervened \u2013 and it also looked like it did not have the votes to pass .\nThe chairman used the pause to correct misconceptions about the bill and to drum up more conservative support . He expressed openness to amendments backed by conservative groups such as Heritage Action and Club for Growth . Several of them were proposed , but only one passed \u2013 a provision to allow parents to have their children opt out of the testing required under the House bill , which is called the Student Success Act .\nThe House plan differs from the Senate version \u2013 it allows more state leeway and provides for federal dollars to \u201c follow \u201d low-income children to charter schools , which Democrats say hollows out the traditional public school system .\nBut a conservative bill was also the fastest and easiest way to simply get a bill through the House \u2013 and to set a GOP marker that will give Kline more leverage in conference negotiations . Still , Kline , who has been meeting regularly with Alexander over breakfast , insists that a conference between the bills \u2019 leaders in both chambers will have to produce a bipartisan product .\n\u201c I told my colleagues , if we expect to really get rid of No Child Left Behind , that means what we pass has to be signed into law .
