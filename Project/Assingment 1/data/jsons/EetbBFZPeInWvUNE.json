You lost your independence once before . With NATO , you will never lose it again .

Every ally must do it , '' he said .\nThe NATO leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant Islamists making gains in Syria and Iraq , and the brutal beheading of a second American by ISIS , also known as ISIL or the `` Islamic State . ''\nAsked about his strategy on the extremist group , Obama said : `` The bottom line is this : Our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it 's no longer a threat not just to Iraq , but also to the region and to the United States .\n`` In order for us to accomplish that , the first phase has been to make sure we 've got an Iraqi government that 's in place , and that we are blunting the momentum that ISIL was carrying out .\n`` And the airstrikes have done that . But now , what we need to do is make sure that we 've got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort , not just in the air , but on the ground , to move that forward . ''\nThe original reason for the summit was to determine how NATO 's mission will proceed in Afghanistan when combat troops depart at the end of the year .\nBut the global unrest , while causing political strife for Obama in the United States , could provide a new purpose for the 65-year-old NATO alliance , which is suffering an `` identity crisis , '' according to one analyst .\nPutin 's actions in Russia have `` required NATO to really adapt and change fairly dramatically , '' said Heather Conley , who directs the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .\n`` In some ways , NATO should thank Vladimir Putin , because it was really searching for its purpose , '' Conley said .\nJUST WATCHED Putin 's power push into Ukraine Replay More Videos ...

Other former Soviet states , like Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , joined NATO in the past decade , hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks .\nAs reassurance to those countries , NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a `` high-readiness '' force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe .\nWhite House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia , though initial reaction from the Kremlin -- which called the move an `` external threat '' -- foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis .\nNATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe , meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia .\nCharles Kupchan , Obama 's top adviser for European affairs , said leaders will describe the new effort as a `` persistent '' force in the easternmost countries , rather than `` permanent .
