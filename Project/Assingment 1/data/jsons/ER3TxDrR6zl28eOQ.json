    "content": "Despite a mountain of historical evidence that the Republican Party does n't seriously stand for smaller government and individual liberty , I maintained some hope that this time would be different . With the GOP 's retaking control of Congress and the White House , I actually thought Obamacare could be repealed and maybe even replaced with free market health care reforms . But though the night is still young in terms of the GOP 's latest return to power , Republicans have quickly demonstrated that I should have trusted my usual pessimism , because it 's clear that they 're not guided by any principled support for limited government .\nThough a few congressional Republicans sincerely believe in markets and freedom , the party is largely dominated by pretenders and outright statists . One need only look back to when Republicans last controlled Washington . Republicans and the George W. Bush administration massively increased spending and the federal debt .\nMilitary spending skyrocketed to pay for dubious wars . Corporate welfare , including farm subsidies , thrived . The federal government became more involved in what should be local matters , such as education . And civil liberties were trampled on under the guise of `` homeland security . '' The GOP not only failed to tackle unsustainable growth in federal entitlement programs but also expanded them by creating Medicare Part D .\nAn amazing thing happened , though , when Barack Obama was elected and the Democrats regained control of Congress . Republicans suddenly remembered the horrors of federal overspending , mounting debt and the endless intrusion by the federal government into every aspect of our lives . Republicans lambasted the notion that Keynesian-style big-government spending would boost the economy . They decried Obamacare and the Democrats ' love for `` socialized medicine . '' They bemoaned continuous growth in federal debt and conveniently laid the problem at Obama 's feet .\nThen another amazing thing happened : Donald Trump was elected , and the GOP was once again in charge . Almost immediately , Republicans began touting increased military and infrastructure spending to create jobs and spur the economy\u2014the very Keynesian-inspired policies they attacked when advocated by Democrats . Even the small number of federal program terminations proposed by the Trump administration were too much for congressional Republicans . Nope\u2014when it comes to the federal budget and yet another looming brush-up against the federal debt ceiling , Republicans reveal that they 're content to maintain an untenable status quo , despite all the lip service paid to the dangers of big government over the years .\nYes , as part of the failed attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare , the GOP did include Medicaid reforms intended to slow the spending growth for the federal/state entitlement program that provides health care for those with lower incomes . There are many problems with the program , which is in dire need of reform . But the same can be said about Medicare and Social Security , which congressional Republicans\u2014and Trump , for that matter\u2014have made clear they wo n't touch . ( Remember then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan 's emotional attack on President Obama for allegedly cutting Medicare during the 2012 campaign ? )\nWhat about the GOP 's supposedly bread-and-butter issue of tax reform ? Regardless of how big or small the positive economic feedback to any tax cuts would be , the bottom line is that serious , permanent spending cuts must be part of the equation . But as we have repeatedly seen , Republicans are so unwilling to shrink the size of government that they already waved the white flag and are actively advocating a new source of revenue to `` pay for '' tax reform . Indeed , I fear that the recent fight over the inclusion of a border adjustment tax to generate revenues is only the beginning . At the rate we 're going , it may not be long until the GOP gets on board with a value-added tax or carbon tax !\nFor all of the GOP 's deriding of Democrats over the years for being `` tax-and-spenders , '' the sad reality is Republicans are on their way to earning the same label . We might only be six months into the return of Republican rule , but it 's already looking as if this second go-round of Republican control in Washington this century could end up being as disastrous\u2014if not more\u2014than the first one .
