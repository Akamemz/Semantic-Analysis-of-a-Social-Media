    "content_original": "LAS VEGAS, NEVADA -- He'd be crazy not to bring up this investigative series, especially since (a) most of the media had to be dragged into covering the story, and tonight is Trump's last big chance to make a direct and unfiltered pitch to tens of millions of voters, and (b) two of the \"stars\" of Project Veritas' show have been fired or resigned. There's blood in the water. Scott Foval got the axe on Monday night, then Bob Creamer fell on his sword the following evening. With both villains felled by their own conduct, Trump has a chance to take this story mainstream, assuming moderator Chris Wallace doesn't beat him to the punch by challenging Clinton about the outrageous actions of operatives who are directly tied to her campaign. Will he? The tea leaves say 'yes:'\n\nAnd Trump is now citing James O'Keefe because #2016 \u2014 Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) October 18, 2016\n\nThat tweet encapsulates the prevailing MSM perspective that O'Keefe's reporting is a weird sideshow that should be ignored by the professionals. But what those videos -- particularly the first one -- depict is pretty explosive stuff, and the subsequent firing and resignation have only fueled the story. Because Trump has been pre-excusing his increasingly likely November loss with cries of \"rigging\" (side note: read this piece on that over-broad charge), he'll probably be tempted to trumpet the second clip, which is being hailed by some as 'proof' of widespread voter fraud by Democrats, who also 'confess' to fixing elections for 50 years. But I'm afraid there's a bit less to that video than meets the eye. Having watched it twice, it's clear that the featured shadowy characters have no compunction whatsoever about spitballing ideas on how to commit voter fraud on a mass scale, but there's no smoking gun that they've done so -- or are actively planning to do so. Foval speaks 'in theory' about one \"if\"-filled scheme, which undercover Project Veritas investigators seem to be at least co-hatching, while Creamer worries that 'our lawyers' may raise reg flags about it (Foval later says Creamer would have to be out of the loop -- wink, wink -- on any follow-through). DREAMer activist Cesar Vargas vaguely mentions the possibility of maybe entertaining a fraud push in 2018 at the end of the video, but even that's hedged. Plus, within its limited context, it's not entirely clear to me that Foval's 'half century' remark referred to bussing in illegal voters, as opposed to astroturf protesters (though he later discusses how one might transport illegal voters to another state without getting caught).\n\n\n\nNone of this is to say that this installment reflects well on any of its targets.
