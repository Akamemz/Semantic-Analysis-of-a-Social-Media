    "content": "Bill O \u2019 Reilly is a phenomenon . He is the host of the top-rated `` The O \u2019 Reilly Factor '' and the co-author of a number of bestselling historical books , notably `` Killing Lincoln '' and `` Killing Kennedy . '' To these he has recently added `` Killing Jesus : A History , '' written with Martin Dugard . I must confess to being a frequent viewer of `` The Factor . '' I enjoy Bill O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s humor , and I usually agree with his social and political opinions ( though on some issues he is not quite conservative enough to suit me ) . I want you to be aware of this at the outset , because I want it to be clear I am not one of the man \u2019 s detractors who look for any opportunity to take him down . This book , a rejoinder to `` Killing Jesus , '' I felt compelled to write by my professional conscience as a New Testament scholar . It is evident to me that Bill O \u2019 Reilly and Martin Dugard are writing way , way out of their fields of expertise and that they simply do not understand either the principles of critical historiography or the difference between a historical and a religious treatment of a topic .\n`` Killing Jesus '' attempts to apply the same principles of journalistic research that worked well enough in O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard \u2019 s books on the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations . But it does not work . I hope to show ( as much as I regret having to ) that the task of reconstructing the events connected with a figure like Jesus Christ , the deity of the Christian faith , and that of writing about modern political figures , is as different as the heavens are from the earth . And `` Killing Jesus '' depends essentially upon ignoring that difference . I should estimate that reporting the historical truth about Jesus falls somewhere between documenting the facts about Robin Hood and Superman . It is just not the same thing at all . Another thing I aim to demonstrate is that to treat Jesus as one treats Abe Lincoln tends to make nonsense of the gospels , our main source concerning Jesus . If one loves the gospel accounts and wants to appreciate them by the standards by which they were written , one does not come out where O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard do . One does not even begin where they begin . If there is any parallel at all between writing about JFK and writing about Jesus , we might have to compare using the gospels for a blow-by-blow account to drawing up `` Killing Kennedy '' from the mass of conspiracy theories entertained by Dale Gribble . In both cases we are dealing with a genre very different from straight history .\nAny biographer of Kennedy or of Lincoln must familiarize himself with the earliest available source material ( though the gospels are not nearly so early or reliable as our authors believe ) and then do a comprehensive study of previous work in the field . One would , for instance , weigh and compare the very different portraits of Honest Abe drawn by Carl Sandburg and C. A. Tripp , who claimed to have \u201c outed \u201d Lincoln as a homosexual . It is important not to disregard the history of scholarship lest one , impatient to reinvent the wheel , wind up producing a wheel greatly inferior to those already available . There is no sign whatsoever that the authors of `` Killing Jesus '' have even begun to do their homework here . In the end notes , true , we find a number of book recommendations , but it is revealing that virtually every one of the New Testament and Jesus books mentioned are the work of evangelical/fundamentalist spin doctors dedicated to defending the proposition that the gospels are entirely accurate , miracles and all . We are not in the No-Spin Zone anymore . And it is not that O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard actually discuss the arguments of these authors . It seems , rather , that O \u2019 Reilly and his collaborator have simply cited these apologists for the faith as a license to treat the gospels as inerrant scripture .\nO \u2019 Reilly has many times contended that `` Killing Jesus '' sticks to the facts and stops short of promoting religious doctrine . Please tell me how a purely historical work time and again asserts as simple fact that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament predictions . It is not enough to refrain from calling Jesus \u201c Christ. \u201d That does not make the book impartial history . The entire treatment of the Bible bears witness that O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard are approaching it as committed religious believers . Both are proud Roman Catholics . So was the late , great New Testament scholar Raymond E. Brown ( whose magisterial work `` The Death of the Messiah , '' thankfully , our authors recommend in the end notes ) , but Father Brown knew the difference between historical research and proof-texting , between writing a scholarly work and writing a narrative novel with a few pedantic digressions thrown in . Raymond E. Brown , Joseph A. Fitzmyer , John Meier , Hans K\u00fcng , Edward Schillebeeckx , Thomas L. Brodie , Herman Hendrickx , Jon Sobrino , all are Roman Catholics \u2014 and not one of them would ever be caught with his name on a book like this one .\n`` Killing Jesus '' has nothing to do with Life of Jesus studies . It is in fact almost a twin to Mel Gibson \u2019 s oh-so-authentic 2004 film `` The Passion of the Christ . '' Both are exhibitions of popular piety aimed at reinforcing believers \u2019 faith and stilling their doubts by providing a real-seeming illusion about the myths and legends of the gospels . Their function is not dissimilar to that of the numerous End Times movies and novels like `` Left Behind , '' `` Image of the Beast '' and `` A Distant Thunder . '' Those fictions , whether on-screen or page ( and `` Killing Jesus '' is already heading for the screen ) , help buttress faith in the ever-receding , always deferred Second Coming of Christ by depicting it in narrative form before the eyes of those who would really like to see the Rapture , the Great Tribulation and so on occurring on the evening news . They don \u2019 t . They can \u2019 t . So End Times fiction is the next best thing , a game of pretend . And that is just the role of `` The Passion of the Christ '' and `` Killing Jesus . '' The familiar Sunday school tales are dressed up in pseudo-documentary form to make the Christian reader feel confident that the legends are historical reports , not legends at all .

'' Like Brown , O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard assure the reader that the fast-paced narrative he is about to read is based on historical fact . And just as Brown \u2019 s \u201c facts \u201d have been gathered from half-cocked \u201c research \u201d like Baigent , Lincoln and Leigh \u2019 s cinderblock of misinformation , Holy Blood , Holy Grail , O \u2019 Reilly and Dugard are too ready to accept the religious apologetics of Craig Evans , Darrell Bock , J. P. Moreland and William Lane Craig as genuine historical scholarship . The reader of either book is sure to be led astray , though admittedly in very different directions .\nO \u2019 Reilly and Dugard are like Ben Bernanke , churning out inflated currency that lacks the value of the amount stamped on it . They are like Jay Carney , bald-facedly handing out the inflexible talking points of an institutional party line , in this case that of conservative Christianity . Bill O \u2019 Reilly has no trouble at all seeing what is really going on in these political cases , but when it comes to religion he can not see it . If he even knows about the great legion of critical scholars who classify most of the gospel story as myth and legend , no doubt he considers them pinheads . If political liberalism is , as David Mamet contends , essentially a fact-proof , dogmatic religious faith , it is a shame that Bill O \u2019 Reilly can see through those illusions but can not penetrate those of Christian apologetics .
