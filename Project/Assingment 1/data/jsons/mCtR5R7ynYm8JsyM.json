Here in New York , Catherine Ruetschlin is a policy analyst at Demos and author of the report , \u201c Fast Food Failure : How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy. \u201d And Terrance Wise joins us from KCPT , Kansas City Public Television . He \u2019 s worked for Burger King for nine years , plans to go on strike today as part of the international push by fast-food and retail workers to demand a living wage . He \u2019 s a member of the Stand Up Kansas City campaign . We last spoke with Terrance in August as the strikes were just beginning here in the U.S .\nWe welcome you both to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! Terrance , let \u2019 s go to you . You have worked at Burger King for nine years . How much do you make an hour , if you don \u2019 t mind me asking ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I \u2019 ve worked in fast food for 17 years and at Burger King for nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour at Burger King .\nAMY GOODMAN : I \u2019 m sorry , I didn \u2019 t catch what you said . Can you say that again ?\nTERRANCE WISE : I \u2019 m sorry . I \u2019 ve been working fast food for 17 years , and Burger King I \u2019 ve worked for the past nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour working there .\nAMY GOODMAN : And why are you going on strike today ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I \u2019 m going on strike for my family . I raise three little girls here in Kansas City , and I need their future not to look anything like the past . We \u2019 ve struggled with homelessness , paying basic utilities\u2014gas , rent , the lights . And that \u2019 s while working every day . The working poor is what we are .\nAMY GOODMAN : Are you concerned about retaliation if you go out today ? What has Burger King said ? Presumably , since this is being organized all over the country , Burger King and McDonald \u2019 s know that workers are going to be walking out .\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , me , I first spoke to you , Amy , in August . That was my first strike . And this is number four for me . So , we know that the federal laws provide us protection when we come together as workers and demand the corporations we work for to pay us a living wage and to give us the right to form a union . So with that knowledge of knowing that the federal government protects our rights to organize and go on strike , it \u2019 s a huge relief for fast-food workers .\nAMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how many hours a week do you work at Burger King ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , it \u2019 s\u2014I make $ 9.40 an hour , so it \u2019 s like 35 , 40 hours a week . It \u2019 s , after taxes , maybe $ 400 every two weeks . And that \u2019 s working double sometimes , going in in the morning and working at night , just not bringing in enough . And we know that these companies make billions in profit . They can afford to pay us better and do better by us and give us a voice on the job . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re demanding .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , Catherine Ruetschlin , you \u2019 ve been studying this , the issue of what these fast-food companies can afford . Your report , \u201c Fast Food Failure : How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy. \u201d What is the disparity between the CEO , say , of Burger King and the workers , or McDonald \u2019 s ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , you know , when I started the study , I didn \u2019 t know that fast food was going to be such an extreme outlier in terms of pay disparity . The study arose kind of in this context that Terrance and other workers like him have created , where there \u2019 s a growing awareness that inequality is undermining the economy at several levels . But when I dug into the data , what I found was that fast food is a catalyst , with inequality that outstrips all the sectors of the economy . The CEO of a fast-food company in 2012 earned 1,200 times what the typical worker earned that year .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Twelve hundred times . And that \u2019 s with a fairly generous assumption that workers in fast food are receiving benefits and work a full-time schedule , which in many cases , you know , isn \u2019 t true .\nAMY GOODMAN : How does that affect the industry and the economy as a whole ? You say it hurts it .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . You know , there \u2019 s a macro-level story that \u2019 s just become a part of the conversation with organizations like the IMF and the World Economic Forum in Davos , pointing to inequality as a threat at the macro level because it generates instability in the economy and undermines growth . But then , at the micro level , firms are starting to wake up to the fact that it undermines their bottom lines , as well . In March , McDonald \u2019 s filed with the SEC and listed income inequality as one of the primary risks facing their own returns over the coming years , not just because workers are striking , but because they \u2019 re having a hard time satisfying their customers because they \u2019 ve underinvested in the front-line services that really build the brand and provide revenues to the firm .\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you respond to the companies saying , \u201c All right , if they increase the workers \u2019 wages , but then consumers have to be willing to pay more for the burgers \u201d ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , firms have a lot of ways that they could pay for a raise . They don \u2019 t necessarily have to pass the cost on to customers . They could do that , but they could also use some of the ways that they \u2019 re redirecting their profits right now . Firms like McDonald \u2019 s spend billions of dollars a year buying back their own shares of company stock on the market in order to consolidate ownership and bump up earnings per share and meet these short-term benchmarks . But that \u2019 s really a short-term understanding of the interest of the firm , right ? If they had a longer-term perspective , they would see that rather than investing in their share price , if they were investing in their labor force , they would generate returns\u2014higher productivity , loyal workers with better knowledge of the company processes , you know , lower turnover rates , so lower costs associated with job search\u2014and it would actually receive benefits through that investment that would pay off in the long run .\nAMY GOODMAN : And the issue of how these companies are subsidized , government-subsidized ?\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . A study came out recently that shows that fast-food employers , like McDonald \u2019 s , Subway , you know , Yum ! Brands , which owns Taco Bell and KFC and Pizza Hut , Domino \u2019 s Pizza , these are some of the highest-ranking employers in terms of working poor . So , if you can\u2014if you look into who \u2019 s receiving healthcare benefits for their families and wage subsidies from the state agencies , from poverty alleviation programs , the highest-ranking firms are Wal-Mart and fast food . So , it \u2019 s the taxpayers who are actually paying the\u2014for the ability for these firms to maintain a labor force at all .\nAMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how does it feel to learn that the CEO makes something like 1,200 times more than what you make ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , I know that workers like myself and my co-workers across the city , we go to work every day , and we \u2019 re the driving force behind his billions in profit he brings in . He \u2019 s buying new yachts and new boats and new cars , and I just want to put my kids through college . So , just to see the disparity that I \u2019 m making $ 9.50 an hour and he makes over $ 9,000 , and just to get that out to the public and that information to be known , it \u2019 s eye-opening . And it calls for change .\nAMY GOODMAN : And , Terrance , the action you \u2019 re going to engage in today in Kansas City , what exactly are you going to do ?\nTERRANCE WISE : Well , like I said earlier , this is my fourth time . And I \u2019 ll band together with the majority of the co-workers at my store and hundreds of workers from around the city , and we \u2019 ll go different parts of the city . We \u2019 ll do chants . We \u2019 ll hold signs . We \u2019 ll give speak-outs . We \u2019 ll try to enter some stores , like I heard them say on New York earlier . In New York City , they \u2019 ve been doing this , and we \u2019 ll be doing this here in Kansas City . It \u2019 s just to get the message out to the public and to our bosses in the companies , that we \u2019 re not afraid . We \u2019 re going to stand together in solidarity , and we demand better . We \u2019 re not asking for a minimum wage increase . It \u2019 s not a minimum wage drive . It \u2019 s for billion-dollar corporations that have the money to pay us better and give us the right to have a union in this industry .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , Terrance Wise , I want to thank you very much for being with us , Burger King worker on strike today , part of Stand Up Kansas City , speaking to us from Kansas City Public Television . And , Catherine Ruetschlin , one more thing , not only the issue of the pay ratio of worker to CEO , 1,200 to one , CEO of course being the 1,200 , but the fast-food CEOs earnings quadrupling .\nCATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That \u2019 s right . What we \u2019 ve seen is that at these firms that have benefited from economic growth , overall , the CEOs and top executives have been able to capture all of those gains . So , while the fast-food CEO pay grew by 470 percent since 2000 , worker earnings only grew by 0.3 percent . Now , that means that their earnings aren \u2019 t even keeping up with the basic cost of living , so they \u2019 re actually losing ground in terms of standard of living year after year .\nAMY GOODMAN : Catherine Ruetschlin , I \u2019 d like you to stay with us , because next up after break we \u2019 re going to talk about Wal-Mart . President Obama spoke at a Wal-Mart recently . Right afterwards , 1,800 warehouse workers in California settled a major wage theft lawsuit against Wal-Mart and one of its largest contractors . This is \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! We \u2019 ll be back in a moment .",
