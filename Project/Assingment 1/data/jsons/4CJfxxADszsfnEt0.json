But the direction the party will take against President Trump remains unsettled .\nDemocrats are seeking to coalesce around a candidate best positioned to defeat the president , the attribute that remains highly valued in surveys of primary voters .\nBut the party is simultaneously going through a soul-searching debate over the role of government and how far federal policies should stretch into the lives of Americans .\nThis Democratic field , the party \u2019 s most diverse ever , will be only the second in nearly three decades that will not feature a Clinton or Obama , and the start of the race has resembled a sorting-out process , with candidates taking contrasting approaches to fundraising , reaching voters and challenging Mr. Trump .\nWho \u2019 s Running in 2020 The 2020 Democratic presidential primary is the party \u2019 s biggest and most diverse in modern history . Meet the candidates .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday became the 20th major candidate to announce a Democratic campaign ; he and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been the two leading contenders in early polling and have formed twin pillars in the party \u2019 s liberal-centrist divide . Mr. Sanders , a self-described democratic socialist who unsuccessfully challenged Hillary Clinton in 2016 , wants to create a Medicare for All single-payer health-care plan , transform the nation \u2019 s energy system to address climate change and establish a federal jobs guarantee to achieve a \u201c full-employment economy . \u201d\nMr. Biden , meanwhile , made clear in his announcement that he intends to campaign as a unifying figure and advance policies put forward by Mr. Obama , who remains widely popular in the party .\n\u201c He actually has the ability to win , first and foremost , \u201d said Harold Schaitberger , the general president of the International Association of Firefighters union , which is weighing an endorsement of Mr. Biden . \u201c This is about a decision about who will be able to compete . You have to compete where the election will be won or lost . \u201d\nMr. Biden \u2019 s biggest selling point will be pointing to his ability to defeat Mr. Trump and challenge the president in battleground states in the Great Lakes region that propelled the president to victory in 2016 .\nBut as the establishment figure in the race , he will need to articulate his views on litmus-test type issues such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal that animate party activists , and defend a record built over more than four decades .\n\u201c For the first time [ in this election ] he will have to explain what he intends to run on . Up to this point , he hasn \u2019 t been held accountable for his record , \u201d said Amanda Litman , the co-founder of Run for Something , a group that recruits young Democrats to run for local office .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden announced his 2020 campaign , in what will be his third run for president . WSJ 's Gerald F.

Much of it would be paid for by an annual tax on the nation \u2019 s wealthiest families .\nThe policy debate raises questions of whether Democratic voters will remain focused on the candidate who is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump or who will deliver on the most liberal aspirations\u2014and whether they can find both in a single candidate .\nCharles Chamberlain , chairman of the progressive group Democracy for America , said many liberals want a nominee who will be less inclined to broker deals with Republicans .\n\u201c We saw them regularly trying to work across the aisle with people who had no interest in working with them , \u201d he said of the Obama years .\nPresidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows , but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous . WSJ \u2019 s Shelby Holliday explains .\nA separate debate is brewing over whether Democrats in the race will push for Mr. Trump \u2019 s impeachment in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report .\nMs. Warren has said Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings and was joined this week by California Sen. Kamala Harris , who said in a CNN forum that Congress should \u201c take the steps toward impeachment. \u201d Other candidates have pushed for Attorney General William Barr \u2019 s testimony and further oversight by Congress , but have stopped short of supporting impeachment proceedings .\nThe campaign has also been marked by different bets on what message will break through with Democratic voters .\nSome candidates like Ms. Warren and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand have cast the race as a brutal fight against Mr. Trump and forces of corruption and corporate influence .\nOthers , such as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep.

They \u2019 re not going to win with the people that I see , and they \u2019 re not going to win against me , \u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday .\nShare Your Thoughts What are the most important qualities Democrats should seek in their nominee ? Join the conversation below .\nThe early months of the race have also shown a transformational change in the way the leading candidates fund their campaigns .\nDuring the first three months , Mr. Sanders raised $ 18.2 million with the help of more than 900,000 individual contributions ; by contrast , at this point in 2007 Mr. Obama led the field with more than 100,000 individual donors .\n\u201c If you can \u2019 t do online fundraising , you can \u2019 t win this race , \u201d said former Vermont Gov . Howard Dean , whose 2004 campaign benefited from early forms of digital fundraising .\nThe sheer size has led the candidates to search for breakout moments that might create attention .\nThe contender who has benefited the most from that dynamic is Pete Buttigieg , the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend , Ind. , whose poll numbers have climbed since a well-received CNN town hall appearance in March .\nMr. Buttigieg , a military veteran who would be the nation \u2019 s first openly gay president , was largely unknown at the start of his campaign .\nFor the rest of the field , the biggest opportunity on the calendar will be the first back-to-back nights of debates planned for Miami in late June .",
