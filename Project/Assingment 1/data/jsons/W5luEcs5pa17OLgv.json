    "content": "The fourth week of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency has been tumultuous , with his top national security official being forced out due to scandal , reports that members of his campaign staff and associates had contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials last year , and various factions of his White House apparently knifing each other in the press . Meanwhile , an initial flurry of new policy actions has slowed to a crawl , his major immigration order remains blocked in the courts , and a significant legislative achievement remains far away .\nSo on Thursday , Trump tried to change the narrative by giving an impromptu press conference \u2014 and what a press conference it was .\nTrump made the case that his administration was \u201c running like a fine-tuned machine , \u201d and that he \u2019 s made \u201c incredible progress \u201d on fixing the nation \u2019 s problems so far . He made a case to \u201c the American people \u201d that he was keeping the promises he made on the campaign trail . He also made a plethora of false claims on matters from the size of his Electoral College win to just what his executive actions actually did .\nBut the larger strategic goal of the presser became clear with one theme Trump repeatedly returned to \u2014 the alleged \u201c dishonesty \u201d of the media , an institution that , it is now clear , Trump has decided to fully elevate as his most important foe .\nIndeed , without Hillary Clinton ( whom Trump was eager to bring up and disparage on Thursday , months after the campaign ended ) or any of his GOP primary rivals as foils to fight back against , the Trump administration has seemed a bit adrift in its first month . Trump seems to feel that he \u2019 s at his best when he \u2019 s fighting , but it wasn \u2019 t clear who his main opponent was now that he \u2019 s the most powerful man in the world .\nWhite House chief strategist Steve Bannon early on suggested that it was now the media that \u2019 s \u201c the opposition party \u201d and therefore Trump \u2019 s most important foe . But it was only on Thursday that Trump truly threw himself into combat with the press on equal footing , by spending an hour or so taking questions from them .\n\u201c Remember , I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech , which was like every day ? \u201d Trump said at one point . \u201c That \u2019 s how I won . I won with news conferences and probably speeches. \u201d He added : \u201c I certainly didn \u2019 t win by people listening to you people , that \u2019 s for sure . \u201d\nYet while Trump seemed to enjoy the freewheeling presser and is clearly experimenting with returning to his unscripted early primary days ( he \u2019 s planned a big rally in Florida this Saturday ) , it \u2019 s hard to see it working .\nHe \u2019 s not in a campaign setting anymore \u2014 he \u2019 s responsible for results . And a combative back and forth will do little to obscure the reality of an administration increasingly beset by scandal that has achieved very little of substance so far .\nPresident Trump wants another enemy to fight and defeat , and he \u2019 s picked the media\nIt was likely no accident that Trump used a lengthy event in which he took questions from the media to ... denounce the media .\nYes , he has been increasingly aggrieved at leaks and critical press coverage of late . But he \u2019 s perfectly capable of making those views clear through prepared statements , friendly interviewed , or tweets .\n\u201c Many of our nation \u2019 s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that we deserve , \u201d he said in his opening statement . \u201c Unfortunately , much of the media in Washington , DC , along with New York , Los Angeles in particular , speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very , very obviously broken system . \u201d\nThen he proceeded to take question after question from those reporters \u2014 even from outlets he says he considers hostile , like CNN , which he complained is full of \u201c anger and hatred . \u201d\nIn doing so , Trump both made the press a scapegoat for anything that \u2019 s gone wrong in his administration so far and elevated the media as an opponent to himself that he could fight back against .\nThe president was rarely at a loss for words in his answers \u2014 even if his train of thought was sometimes difficult to follow . Asked how he could deem leaks of accurate information to be fake news , he responded : \u201c The leaks are real ; you \u2019 re the one that wrote about them and reported them . The leaks are absolutely real . ... The news is fake because so much of the news is fake . \u201d\nWhen it came to the topic dominating news coverage of the administration this week \u2014 the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 Trump bobbed and weaved .\nTo recap : During the transition , Flynn made a series of phone calls with the Russian ambassador around the time President Obama was announcing new sanctions on the country in reprisal for election-related email hacking . Flynn maintained , both publicly and ( the administration claims ) privately , that sanctions were never discussed in the calls , and Vice President Mike Pence made that case in public .\nHowever , it turned out that US intelligence agencies were keeping tabs on the calls and that sanctions were in fact discussed . Trump \u2019 s team was informed of that by acting Attorney General Sally Yates , but they did nothing about it until news leaked out into the Washington Post . Flynn was fired soon afterward .\nMany have wondered whether Flynn was freelancing or whether he was acting on Trump \u2019 s instructions when he talked sanctions with the ambassador . That \u2019 s a potential problem because it could violate an obscure , rarely enforced law called the Logan Act .\nBut the line Trump took in the presser was essentially that even though he didn \u2019 t ask Flynn to talk sanctions , he wasn \u2019 t particularly bothered by the fact that he did so . Flynn , he said , was just \u201c doing his job. \u201d However , he continued , \u201c the thing is he didn \u2019 t tell our vice president properly and then he said he didn \u2019 t remember , so either way it wasn \u2019 t very satisfactory to me . \u201d\nWhat Trump elides here is that he had known that Flynn misled the vice president since last January but did not fire Flynn until the news leaked this week .\nFurthermore , when asked about the recent report that some of his top associates were in contact with senior Russian intelligence officials before the election , Trump said it came from the \u201c failing New York Times . \u201d\nHe insisted his associates had denied that the story was true . \u201c Speaking for myself , I know nothing in Russia , I have no loans in Russia , I don \u2019 t have any deals in Russia. \u201d He insisted again , \u201c I had nothing to do with it ! I have nothing to do with Russia , I told you ! \u201d\n\u201c Russia is fake news , \u201d he added . The \u201c real news , \u201d he said , was the leaking of information from \u201c confidential investigations . \u201d\nAt several points , Trump himself made statements that were , well , fake . The best example , which reporters confronted him over , was his demonstrably false brag about the size of his Electoral College victory .\n\u201c I put it out before the American people , got 306 electoral college votes , \u201d he said . \u201c I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan . \u201d\nThat last part would be true \u2014 except for George H.W . Bush \u2019 s win , Bill Clinton \u2019 s two wins , and Barack Obama \u2019 s two wins . So almost all of them .\nOne reporter called him on this , and Trump clarified he was only talking about Republicans . But even that wasn \u2019 t true , because of George H.W . Bush . Finally , he admitted , \u201c I was given that information , I don \u2019 t know. \u201d He added : \u201c I had a very big margin . \u201d\nTrump wants to paint a picture of success . It \u2019 s not convincing .\nPerhaps the most narrative-defying argument Trump tried to make was that his administration has been extraordinarily successful .\n\u201c I turn on the TV , open the newspapers , and I see stories of chaos , chaos , \u201d he said . \u201c Yet it \u2019 s the exact opposite . The administration is running like a fine-tuned machine . \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t seem to be remotely true , as Matt Yglesias recently wrote . There was much less to Trump \u2019 s initial flurry of executive actions than met the eye . Many simply announced priorities or called on administration officials to draw up plans to solve some problems eventually .\nMeanwhile , Trump \u2019 s most significant executive action \u2014 his immigration order \u2014 is stalled in court . On that topic , Trump insisted that \u201c we had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban . But we had a bad court , a bad decision. \u201d What actually happened was notoriously chaotic , led to hundreds of people being detained , initially applied to up to 500,000 green card holders before being modified , and was so poorly crafted that it was blocked in court . Now , Trump says , he \u2019 s going to pull it and replace it with a new version , which doesn \u2019 t exactly imply a smooth rollout .\nThe bigger picture is that the president has signed no significant new laws and made little progress on what were supposed to be the two biggest Republican priorities \u2014 Obamacare repeal and tax reform . As for the administration itself , its officials have spent much of their time leaking furiously to undermine one another and sometimes even the president himself .\nAnd though Trump mostly stuck to the line that he \u2019 d achieved extraordinary things already , he did at one point acknowledge that his team was being at least somewhat distracted by the many controversies unfolding .\n\u201c Take a look at Reince , \u201d Trump said , referring to his chief of staff , Reince Priebus . \u201c He \u2019 d rather be working on health care . He \u2019 d rather be working on tax reform. \u201d Instead , though , \u201c he \u2019 s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. \u201d He added : \u201c Isn \u2019 t that a shame ? \u201d",
