Lately commentators have heaved a world-weary sigh and pointed at a more existential culprit : human nature . That sounds like a compelling , intuitive -answer\u2014after all , people online do lots of awful and ugly stuff . As a diagnosis , though , it \u2019 s dangerously superficial and lets tech companies off easy . The worst qualities of online space aren \u2019 t inevitable : they \u2019 re a natural result of a lack of human dignity .\nDignity\u2014literally \u201c worthy \u201d in Latin\u2014matters because it \u2019 s an idea that we \u2019 ve returned to again and again over the centuries as a way of understanding how humans can live together decently , respectfully . But it \u2019 s been absent from our recent conversations about technological ills . This history puts in a new light what \u2019 s gone wrong online\u2014and suggests how we might set it right .\nConsider the relationship between dignity and conflict described by Donna Hicks , a Harvard conflict\u2013resolution expert who has worked on the conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians and in Northern Ireland and Colombia . Over decades in the field , Hicks saw a repeating pattern : conflicts came about when people felt they were being disrespected and treated as worthless . \u201c We long to look good in the eyes of others , to feel good about ourselves , to be worthy of others \u2019 care and attention , \u201d Hicks writes . When people are treated as if we don \u2019 t matter or aren \u2019 t due respect , we become vindictive , tribalistic and vengeful . \u201c Research suggests that we are just as programmed to sense a threat to our dignity as we are to a physical threat , \u201d Hicks writes . \u201c Neuroscientists have found that a psychological injury such as being excluded stimulates the same part of the brain as a physical wound . \u201d\nIn Hicks \u2019 model , to be treated with dignity is to be seen and accepted for who we are , to be treated fairly and given the benefit of the doubt and to be offered independence and accountability . Online spaces fail us on these fronts . We \u2019 re encouraged to be something other than what we are . We struggle to be heard and seen . If \u201c love is attention , \u201d as Hicks wrote in her book Dignity , platforms intrude on these relationships , determining who and what gets attended to , on a mass scale , for the sake of ad clicks . To be online , in other words , is to be in a state of chronic , near constant dignity violation . It \u2019 s no surprise that anger , divisiveness , and bad behavior follow .\nThe authors of the UN Declaration of Human Rights \u2014 the key document in modern human rights law \u2014 understood this relationship between dignity and conflict . The Declaration \u2019 s first sentence begins with a recognition of \u201c the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [ that ] is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world. \u201d Without dignity , they understood , peace is impossible .\nGet The Brief .
