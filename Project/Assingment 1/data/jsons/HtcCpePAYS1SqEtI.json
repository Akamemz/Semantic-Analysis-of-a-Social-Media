In that time , those on the left have shifted their sights from expanding big government programs to preserving the legacy left by President Obama \u2014 all while worrying about the possibility of executive overreach during the next administration .\nThis new-found concern for executive power is ironic given that the Obama administration \u2019 s signature move has been aggressively to sidestep the democratic process .\nPresident Obama has been unapologetic about his unprecedented use of executive power , and of course , that robust view of the executive \u2019 s prerogative does not occur in a vacuum but creates an important precedent .\n\u201c The New York Times \u201d acknowledged as much prior to the election noting that Obama \u2019 s pursuit of \u201c executive power without apology \u2026 will shape the presidency for decades to come . \u201d\nAs a candidate , President Obama expressed misgivings about executive power . After the 2010 mid-term elections , however , it became clear that Congress would not go along with the president \u2019 s sweeping regulatory agenda . So he pledged : \u201c Where they won \u2019 t act , I will . \u201d\nHe vowed to pursue \u201c audacious \u201d executive action in his final term . And in his January 2014 State of the Union Address , President Obama promised to \u201c wherever and whenever \u201d possible \u201c take steps without legislation . \u201d\nPresident Obama made good on these promises ; his use of Executive Orders , Executive Agreements , Agency Guidance , and Agency Rulemaking unilaterally to change domestic policy is unparalleled in modern times . Indeed , according to \u201c The New York Times , \u201d President Obama \u2019 s two terms have been characterized by \u201c bureaucratic bulldozing , rather than legislative transparency . \u201d\nAll of this is quite remarkable given that the Constitution vests the power to make law with Congress , not the president , as President Obama , once a lecturer in constitutional law , well knows .\nIn his first term , for example , he told immigration activists who were pressing for unilateral action that he did not have the authority to \u201c waive away the law Congress put in place. \u201d Fast forward a few years , and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) had located the power to confer \u201c lawful status \u201d on at least 4.3 million illegal aliens \u2014 a measure specifically rejected by Congress .\nObama acknowledged that the DHS guidance was intended to \u201c change the law. \u201d In preventing the guidance from going into effect , a federal district court agreed , finding that President Obama \u201c is not just rewriting the laws , he is creating them from scratch . \u201d\nThe Supreme Court was concerned , too . In deciding to review the case , the court took the highly unusual step of adding a question , asking whether the DHS Guidance violated the Take Care Clause of the Constitution , which requires that the president \u201c take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . \u201d\nIn adding this question , the Supreme Court signaled its concern that the president may have gone beyond his duty to execute the law .\nSimilarly , during Obama \u2019 s first term , administration officials indicated that they did not have the power independently to raise the minimum wage or increase benefits for federal contract workers . Then , in Feb. 2014 , President Obama signed Executive Order 13658 , which raised the minimum wage for hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers .\nHis administration subsequently increased workplace benefits and protections for all workers at companies that held federal contracts\u2014roughly 29 million individuals .\nPresident Obama \u2019 s unilateral joining of the Paris Accord is particularly audacious .

That authority must have a constitutional foundation .\nThe secretary of State \u2019 s website describes \u201c three constitutional bases \u201d for international agreements that are not treaties .\nFirst , a prior treaty may authorize the president to act unilaterally .\nSecond , the president may conclude an international agreement based on existing legislation enacted by Congress .\nAnd third , the president may join international agreements based on his foreign affairs power ; authority to receive ambassadors ; authority as commander in chief ; or the president \u2019 s duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed .\nBecause none of these sources of constitutional authority apply here , it \u2019 s not clear President Obama possesses the authority to join the United States to the Paris Accord , even when the administration insists it is merely hortatory .\nMore examples abound .
