Indeed , with less the two months before the parties are scheduled to hold their summer conventions , the only predictable aspect to the 2020 campaign is how far from \u201c normal \u201d this political season is proving to be .\n\u201c So far , this is not unfolding like a traditional campaign , \u201d says Matthew Dickinson , a political scientist at Middlebury College in Vermont . \u201c Like all things in the age of the coronavirus , this is uncharted territory . \u201d\nThe upcoming conventions offer a clear contrast between the candidates \u2019 approaches to COVID-19 precautions , as well as the differing partisan perspectives on the issue even as cases spike in two dozen states .\nEarlier this year , the Democratic National Committee pushed back the date of its convention in Milwaukee from July to August . The party chair currently says he is unsure of attendance size , and many are speculating that at least part of the convention will take place online .\nMr. Trump , on the other hand , recently moved the main events for the Republican National Convention in August from Charlotte , North Carolina , to Jacksonville , Florida , after failing to come to an agreement with North Carolina \u2019 s Democratic governor about how to handle large in-person gatherings .\nIf the rally in Tulsa was any indication , the president \u2019 s goal of a traditional convention may be easier said than done .\nIan Maule/Tulsa World/AP President Donald Trump walks toward the stage while supporters cheer during his campaign rally at the BOK Center in Tulsa , Oklahoma , June 20 , 2020 .\nDespite the president \u2019 s claim that almost 1 million people requested tickets to the Tulsa event , large sections of the 19,000-seat BOK Center remained empty . ( The city \u2019 s fire department estimated that fewer than 6,200 people attended the event , while the Trump campaign said 12,000 attended . ) Before Mr. Trump took the podium Saturday evening for an almost two-hour-long rambling speech , his team broke down an outdoor stage that had been created for an overflow crowd that never materialized .\nSome users of TikTok , a social media app that shares short videos , claimed credit for the lower-than-expected turnout in Tulsa , after videos calling for Trump opponents to register for the event and not attend went viral . The Trump campaign , for its part , blamed protesters \u2013 whose anticipated presence , they said , discouraged many older Trump supporters and those with young children from attending . Media reports suggested the actual number of protestors was relatively low .\nOf course , it \u2019 s still notable that Mr. Trump was able to draw thousands of supporters in person during a pandemic . \u201c There is no comparison between the Darby and Tulsa events . [ Mr. Biden \u2019 s event ] looks like an elementary school cafeteria , compared to the massive arenas that Trump has filled and will continue to fill , \u201d says Tricia Hope , a rally attendee and real estate agent from Houston , who spoke to the Monitor by phone after the rally .\nNevertheless , concerns about a massive indoor rally in a state with rising COVID-19 cases might have kept some supporters away ; the Trump campaign \u2019 s efforts to hype the attendance numbers in advance may have worked against them in that regard . And that \u2019 s a challenge that may well persist , as the virus currently is on the uptick in a number of states where the president is expected to campaign , such as Arizona , Texas , Florida , and North Carolina .\nAfter the Tulsa rally , the campaign revealed that two members of its advance team , who had attended the indoor event , tested positive for the virus . Six other advance team workers had tested positive before the rally .\nStill , Randall Thom , a Trump supporter from Minnesota who has attended 64 rallies including the event in Tulsa , argues that if anything the safety precautions in Tulsa were too strict , complicating the entry process .\n\u201c Having the rallies is not a bad thing \u2013 we have to get back to normal , and not the new normal that is being pushed down our throats as Americans , \u201d writes Mr. Thom in a text message . \u201c I am not afraid of the virus . I am afraid that if Biden gets elected my freedom and liberty will be taken . \u201d\nMr. Trump isn \u2019 t the only one struggling to chart a way back to normal . Mr. Biden has also found himself campaigning under restrictive conditions that are in some ways ill-suited to his strengths .\nCurrent polls , however , suggest Mr. Biden is in a strong position . A Fox News poll from mid-June has Mr. Biden ahead by 12 points nationally , and recent surveys from critical swing states such as Michigan , Florida , and Wisconsin also show Mr. Biden ahead . While the president has a substantial financial advantage over his Democratic opponent , Mr. Biden out-raised Mr. Trump in the month of May , bringing in almost $ 81 million to the president \u2019 s $ 74 million .\n\u201c In this instance , you don \u2019 t have to boil the ocean . It \u2019 s about campaigning in a thoughtful way that activates your voters and persuades independents to consider voting for you , \u201d says Scott Mulhauser , a political communications expert and former deputy chief of staff for Mr. Biden during the 2012 election . \u201c You \u2019 re not competing for a total number of Twitter followers , you \u2019 re competing for electoral votes . \u201d\nWhen campaigning against an unpopular incumbent ( Mr. Trump \u2019 s average approval rating over the past four years of 40 % puts him 13 points below the average president ) , the longstanding political wisdom for a challenger has always been to get out of the way , says Alvin Tillery , director of Northwestern University \u2019 s Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy .\n\u201c Journalists , pundits , and Twitterati want to talk about Biden \u2019 s virtual campaign not being visible enough , \u201d says Mr. Tillery . \u201c But why have the normal rules of politics changed just because it \u2019 s online ? \u201d\nIndeed , the restricted 2020 campaign may actually be benefiting the gaffe-prone Mr. Biden , who often struggles speaking off the cuff \u2013 and who , throughout the Democratic primary season , rarely drew large crowds .\n\u201c At the end of the day , think about the optics of Biden barely being able to fill a small reception hall , \u201d says Rachel Bitcofer , a political scientist at Christopher Newport University . \u201c For Biden , the less visible he is , probably the better . \u201d\nFewer than 2,500 people were watching , for example , when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett introduced Mr. Biden for a virtual Wisconsin \u201c rally \u201d in late May . To close out the event , Mr. Biden passed the proverbial mic to Sen. Tammy Baldwin , who was sitting in front of a white wall with a Biden logo crookedly taped to the left of her head .\n\u201c You have more Trump supporters engaging with campaign staff [ and surrogates ] than you have Biden supporters engaging with the actual candidate , \u201d says Eric Wilson , a Republican digital strategist and director of the Center for Campaign Innovation , referring to virtual events with Mr. Trump \u2019 s family and advisors .\nMr. Biden \u2019 s relative seclusion has seemed to frustrate the Trump campaign .
