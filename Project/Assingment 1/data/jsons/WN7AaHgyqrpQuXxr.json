Leevy Johnson , the Democrats \u2019 search for a challenger to take on President Donald Trump is personal .\n\u201c There is what I call an \u2018 ABT mood \u2019 in the black community : Anybody but Trump , \u201d said the 77-year-old who was the first black graduate of the University of South Carolina \u2019 s law school . \u201c It has people of color very motivated and excited about voting this time because they know how his administration has adversely affected them . \u201d\nNow , as the election calendar turns to Nevada and South Carolina , states with substantial minority populations , that \u201c anybody \u201d moves closer to being identified . But the next stage in the nominating fight will test candidates such as Sens . Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , and Pete Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana . Their success thus far has come in front of overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire .\nIt \u2019 s also a potential last comeback opportunity for former Vice President Joe Biden . He finished poorly in those first two contests but argues he has durable support among the minority voters who will soon make their choices .\nNevada \u2019 s caucuses are this coming Saturday and will feature a growing population of Latinos , African Americans , Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders . Yet no single place in the early going is as important as South Carolina . Up to two-thirds of voters in the Feb. 29 primary could be African American . Biden , more than any other candidate , must show he can win their allegiance .\nOne candidate who will not be tested in Nevada or South Carolina is Mike Bloomberg , the former New York mayor and billionaire owner of a financial services and media empire . Bloomberg has spent heavily from his personal fortune in states with sizable minority populations that will vote in the March 3 primaries . The Super Tuesday contests are the first where his name will appear on the ballot .\nIt adds up to a muddled field that lacks clarity even after Iowa and New Hampshire had their turns. , Moderates have splintered their votes and created space for Sanders , a self-described democratic socialist , to take on the mantle of a front-runner without having reached 30 % in either of the first two voting states .\nThat intensifies the spotlight as minority voters in Nevada and South Carolina in trying to clarify the party \u2019 s search for \u201c anybody \u201d to match against Trump .\n\u201c The system is garbage , \u201d said Jason Johnson , a professor at Morgan State University and a high-profile African American political commentator . He argued that the primary calendar should immediately subject candidates not just to racial and ethnic diversity but also regional and ideological differences , and the full city-to-farm spectrum . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure this process actually can identify the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump , \u201d he said .\nJason Johnson said he doesn \u2019 t blame the candidates because they are merely reacting to a process \u201c that harms everybody. \u201d But I.S . Leevy Johnson , the South Carolina businessman and lawyer , said it too easily makes key constituencies in the party an afterthought . \u201c People of color are tired of these promises that candidates are going to do things , and when they make those promises , when they get elected , they don \u2019 t perform , \u201d he said .\nSanders fell short in 2016 to Hillary Clinton for the nomination in no small part because of his struggles to attract older nonwhite voters . For 2020 , he has hired as a senior adviser one of the top Latino strategists in the party , Chuck Rocha . Sanders \u2019 lead surrogates include Nina Turner , a former Ohio state lawmaker and leading black progressive , and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , the young progressive icon . Sanders \u2019 campaign , buoyed by strong grassroots fundraising , has invested heavily in social media and radio advertising targeting black and Latino audiences , including stations on Spotify and Pandora .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re going to do very well in the African American community , \u201d Sanders said in a brief interview . \u201c I think we \u2019 re going to do well among working people of all races . \u201d\nIn Nevada , Biden campaigned on Saturday in a high school gymnasium covered in signs that read : \u201c Biden Trabajando por Nevada \u201d ( Biden Works for Nevada ) . \u201c The reason why we are here : 99 % of the African American vote hasn \u2019 t spoken yet and 99 % of the Latino vote hasn \u2019 t spoken yet. \u201d He hammered away at Trump \u2019 s immigration policies and rhetoric .\nBut Biden has embraced South Carolina especially , even skipping out on his New Hampshire primary night party last Tuesday for a hastily arranged event in Columbia , the South Carolina capital .\nBiden is banking on voters such as Jean Hopkins , an 88-year-old retired nurse , who came to hear him . \u201c You \u2019 ll lose some but you may gain more , \u201d she said of his losses in Iowa and New Hampshire . \u201c And he \u2019 s not going to stop . ...
