A broken valve on a 12,600-gallon storage tank may have caused the spill , which Noble reported on June 20 . \u2022 On June 30 , a KP Kauffman Co. flowline leak of crude oil , between 42 and 210 gallons , reached an irrigation ditch used to capture flood irrigation water for reuse . Emergency crews used booms to keep oil from flowing into the Lower Boulder irrigation ditch . Kauffman crews were excavating contaminated soil and replaced the leaky flowline . \u2022 About 294 gallons of oil spilled from Bonanza Creek facilities on Colorado State Land Board property that serves as wildlife habitat , 6.7 miles east of Kersey about 900 feet from the South Platte River . `` A separator dumpline '' split open , causing the spill . Bonanza crews used vacuum trucks to suck up 210 gallons . Company officials said none reached the river .
