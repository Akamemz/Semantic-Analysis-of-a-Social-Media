    "content": "Terry Pierce was shocked this month when he found a man pointing a pistol in his face . \u201c All this over a political statement over a hat , \u201d Pierce told WBKO-TV , after a court hearing about the Feb. 16 incident at a Sam \u2019 s Club store in Bowling Green , Kentucky . Police say James Phillips was enraged because Pierce and his wife were wearing red \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d ( MAGA ) hats and , after a verbal exchange , Phillips pulled a .40-caliber Glock on Pierce . This was no idle threat . Phillips has a criminal record , including a 2013 charge of felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , and there was a round in the chamber of his Glock , police say . The man in the MAGA hat was dismayed .\n\u201c Everybody has a right to believe how they believe , \u201d Pierce said Friday of the frightening encounter , \u201c but you don \u2019 t have a right to tell somebody they can \u2019 t believe a certain way . \u201d\nPerhaps the most astonishing thing about that incident is that it happened in Warren County , Kentucky , which President Trump carried by a 30-point margin in 2016 . It \u2019 s such a Republican stronghold that the local GOP congressman , Rep. Brett Guthrie , had no Democrat challenger in 2016 and won re-election in 2018 with 67 % of the vote against Democrat Hank Linderman . If anti-Trump rage can make it dangerous to wear a MAGA cap in deep-red Bowling Green , how much more dangerous must it be to show support for the president in deep-blue Democrat-dominated urban coastal enclaves ?\nThat was the subtext of last month \u2019 s incident at the Lincoln Memorial , where a group of Catholic schoolboys from Covington , Kentucky , found themselves harassed by a group of so-called \u201c Black Hebrew Israelites. \u201d This is a rather notorious cult , and video showed them \u201c yelling the most obscene slurs at these boys , \u201d as Lin Wood , attorney for Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann , told Sean Hannity last week . Sandmann is suing the Washington Post for $ 250 million . Whether or not the Post is ever found guilty of defaming the 16-year-old , it \u2019 s obvious one reason video of Sandmann \u2019 s confrontation with Nathan Phillips went viral is that the Covington boys were wearing red MAGA hats . They \u2019 d bought the hats as souvenirs of their visit to the nation \u2019 s capital , evidently without realizing the pro-Trump hats might make them conspicuous in overwhelmingly liberal D.C. After the Black Hebrew Israelites had spent an hour yelling homophobic and anti-white slurs at the Catholic boys , who had come to Washington for the annual \u201c March for Life , \u201d they were approached by Phillips , who had attended an \u201c Indigenous Peoples March \u201d that day . This was how the video clip of Phillips beating his drum in front of Sandmann came to be , and what enraged liberals was the MAGA hat on Sandmann \u2019 s head and the smile on his face .\n\u201c The red MAGA hat is the new white hood , \u201d left-wing actress Alyssa Milano proclaimed on Twitter . When this remark drew criticism , Ms. Milano doubled down , saying the hats are \u201c synonymous with white nationalism and racism , \u201d and accusing the Catholic teenagers of \u201c flaunting their entitlement and displaying toxic masculinity. \u201d The Covington boys were targeted for all this abuse , you understand , simply because their hats expressed support for the President of the United States , who just happened to win Kentucky by a 30-point margin over Hillary Clinton . ( Covington , across the Ohio River from Cincinnati , is in Kenton County , which Trump won with nearly 60 % of the vote . ) The partisan divide in America is also a geographical divide . Alyssa Milano lives in Bell Canyon , California , which is 84 % white , roughly comparable to Covington ( 87 % white ) , but there the similarity ends . The annual median household income in Ms. Milano \u2019 s community is over $ 200,000 , whereas it \u2019 s less than $ 44,000 in Kenton County , and Bell Canyon is in Ventura County , where Hillary beat Trump by a nearly 18-point margin .\nWhat this shows is the extent to which Democrats have become the party of wealthy elites , including Hollywood celebrities , whereas Republicans represent the Middle American values of people in places like Covington . It \u2019 s easy for someone like Alyssa Milano to hurls insults at Catholic boys from Kentucky , because she \u2019 s never been to Covington and none of her friends in Hollywood wear MAGA hats . She hates everyone who voted for Trump , all 62.9 million of them , and this blind hatred of Republicans defines the current liberal worldview . Anyone who \u2019 s looked at the map of the 2016 election results can see how Democrats are isolated , living in like-minded enclaves . Of the 65.8 million votes Clinton won in 2016 , more than a third of them , about 22.5 million , came from just six states ( California , New York , Illinois , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Virginia ) . The post-election boast that Clinton won the popular vote rests entirely on the lopsided majorities she got in California ( a margin of about 4.3 million ) and New York ( by a margin of 1.7 million ) . It \u2019 s tautological to say that , in the places where most liberals live , most people are liberal , but the geographical concentration of Democrat voters is such that few of them actually know anything about the people who vote Republican . To liberals , therefore , those red hats with the \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d slogan symbolize a distant and alien tribe , and everything the liberal sees on his favorite cable-news outlets , CNN and MSNBC , tells him to hate the MAGA tribe .\nThis tribal division was apparent even before Trump was elected . At the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland , anti-GOP protesters waved signs declaring \u201c American Was NEVER Great ! We Need to OVERTHROW This System ! \u201d Those signs bore the imprimatur of the Revolutionary Communist Party , a radical Maoist splinter group , but expressed a view widely prevalent on the Left , that America \u2019 s history is a tale of genocidal oppression . In this view , it was not until Barack Obama became president that America began to atone for its historical sins , and the Republican Party is the living symbol of this \u201c America the Evil \u201d past that Democrats seek to remedy . This was why Hillary \u2019 s supporters believed they were on \u201c the right side of history , \u201d and why her defeat in 2016 was so traumatic for Democrat voters . In their view , the \u201c greatness \u201d Trump promised to restore was oppressive \u2014 racist , sexist , and homophobic ( not to mention the cause of \u201c climate change \u201d ) . Democrats are against American greatness , which is why wearing a MAGA hat can be dangerous if you \u2019 re near Democrats .\nJust ask Bryton Turner , who was eating in a Mexican restaurant Feb. 15 in Falmouth , Massachusetts , when he was assaulted by a woman enraged by his red MAGA hat . Rosiane Santos , 41 , faces charges of disorderly conduct and assault and battery in the incident . An immigrant from Brazil , Ms. Santos admitted to WFXT-TV that she \u201c had a little bit to drink \u201d before she attacked Turner , but insisted the assault was justified because she had suffered discrimination in the past . \u201c He \u2019 s not a victim . I am the victim . I have been bullied , OK ? \u201d This is a fair summary of what is emerging as the Democrat campaign theme for 2020 , and it \u2019 s unlikely to be a winning message . Trump has driven liberals crazy , and most Americans don \u2019 t want to put these crazy liberals in charge of the country .",
