Ocasio-Cortez represents the young , radically progressive of the Democratic Party . The kind that wants the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency abolished and single payer health care . Instead of welcoming her with open arms , leaders have been trying to sweep her surprise victory under the rug . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi chalked it up as an anomaly .\nRep. Denny Heck ( D-WA ) is the most recent Democrat to cast doubt on Ocasio-Cortez 's win and to urge a more moderate agenda . While Heck does not agree with the Trump administration separating families at the border , he sees the value in having ICE crack down on illegal drugs and bring violent illegal immigrants to justice . He also voted to reauthorize the agency last year , to the chagrin of some progressives .
