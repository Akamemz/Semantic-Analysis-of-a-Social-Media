Earlier Sunday , U.S. Central Command ( CentCom ) said that it had launched 11 airstrikes overnight in the area .\nCentCom said U.S. C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and supplies provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq . It said they were intended to enable continued resistance to Islamic State efforts to take full control of Kobani .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 is told by Kurdish officials in the area that they have received the supplies , dropped in open land held by Kurdish fighters .\nIn a conference call with reporters after CentCom announced the airdrops , senior administration officials said three C-130 planes dropped 27 bundles of small arms , ammunition and medical supplies . The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House .\nOne official said that while the results of the mission are still being assessed , it appeared that `` the vast majority '' of the supplies reached the intended Kurdish fighters .\nThe official also said the C-130s encountered no resistance from the ground in Syria during their flights in and out of Syrian airspace .\nThe airdrops are almost certain to anger the Turkish government , which has said it would oppose any U.S. arms transfers to the Kurdish rebels in Syria . Turkey views the main Kurdish group in Syria as an extension of the Turkish Kurd group known as the PKK , which has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terror group by the U.S. and by NATO .\nPresident Obama called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday to discuss the situation in Syria and notify him of the plan to make airdrops Sunday , one administration official told reporters . He would not describe Erdogan 's reaction , but said U.S. officials are clear about Turkey 's opposition to any moves that help Kurdish forces that Turkey views as an enemy .\nOne of the administration officials said the airdrops should be seen as a humanitarian move . He said U.S. officials believe that if Kobani were to fall , the Islamic State militants would massacre Kurds in the town .\nAnother administration official said `` you might see more '' U.S. re-supply missions to benefit the Kurdish fighters in Kobani in the days ahead .
