    "content": "DURHAM , N.H. \u2013 Ashlyn Giroux and Phoebe Mulry held signs on stage for Bernie Sanders when the U.S. senator from Vermont had a rally here in September .\nBut in between classes at the University of New Hampshire Wednesday , the two freshmen made their way to hear Sen. Elizabeth Warren speak on campus . Both said they 've donated $ 5 to Warren 's presidential campaign , although only Mulry has fully committed to backing the Massachusetts Democrat in the primary . Both plan to get more active ahead of voting .\n`` Elizabeth Warren is my candidate , '' Mulry said , explaining that she donated to the campaign after a discussion in her government class about mobilizing the electorate . `` I wanted to feel like I was a part of her campaign . ''\nOne year out from the 2020 presidential election , and less than 100 days before the first votes are counted in the Iowa caucuses , Democrats are working to energize one of their biggest strengths \u2013 young voters .\nIt 's not just a short game for Democrats seeking the party 's nomination . Democrats , from county organizers to national party leadership , are looking to build on last year 's momentum to defeat President Donald Trump in the general election . In the 2018 midterms , turnout among voters ages 18 to 29 more than doubled from 2014 , and they overwhelmingly backed Democrats .\nLike past cycles , students are coordinating with campaigns and enlisting supporters . College Democrat groups , especially those in early voting states such as Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina , are hosting town halls and meet-and-greets with presidential hopefuls . Democrats are also training students to caucus and register first-time voters .\nBut those efforts also come as political activism among young liberals is already heightened \u2013 on display in 2018 and again this summer , when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across the U.S. demanding action on climate change .\nNeither Murly nor Giroux , both 18 , were old enough to vote in 2016 . Giroux said she 's still split between Sanders and Warren , calling the other Democrats in the field `` very in the middle , and I 'm way more far left . '' Mulry said young progressives are motivated because of the `` severity '' of what 's at stake in 2020 .\nCarolyn DeWitt , president and executive director of Rock the Vote , said young voters have `` incredible power '' to determine the direction of the country , noting nearly 40 % of the electorate in 2020 will be millennial or Generation Z voters . Rock the Vote , a nonpartisan nonprofit , has worked for three decades to register young voters , inform them of the voting process and increase their participation .\n`` If young people , young adults , turn out to vote , it 's kind of a game-over situation , '' DeWitt said . `` They can dominate and determine pretty much everything . The record-breaking numbers we saw last year , I expect that we will continue to see those next year , ( but ) there is a lot of work that we need to do . ''\nMore : Young Iowa Democrats , coming of age in the Trump era , approach 2020 caucuses with new urgency\nWith progressive causes such as gun control and climate change bringing louder battle cries from young voters , and competitive races in traditionally conservative states like Texas and Georgia , 28.2 % of eligible youth voters went to the polls in 2018 . That 's compared with 13 % of eligible young voters who voted in the 2014 midterms , according to research from the nonpartisan Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement ( CIRCLE ) at the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University . Voters 30 and older increased their turnout as well , but only by 10 percentage points .\nDemocratic congressional candidates won 67 % of voters ages 18 to 29 in 2018 \u2013 a greater than 2-to-1 margin than the 32 % of young people who voted for Republicans .\nIt marked the largest share of the youth vote won by Democrats in recent political history , surpassing even the margins under President Barack Obama , when Democratic congressional candidates won 60 % of the youth vote in 2008 and 2012 . Obama won 66 % of young voters in 2008 .\n`` Things have really shifted , and there 's no sign of slowing that down right now that I can tell , '' said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg , director of CIRCLE . She said it 's not simply a backlash against Trump . Rather , issues like racial equity , climate change and gun control have attracted young people , who tend to be more diverse , to Democrats . `` There 's a definite , explicit statement from young people that they need leaders that will support their priorities . ''\nAt a recent Cory Booker meet-and-greet in Washington , D.C. , Madeline Sweitzer , 24 , called 2020 `` probably the most important presidential election of our lifetime . '' The nonprofit worker , who is leaning toward supporting Warren , said her vote is less about partisanship for a Democrat and more about removing a president she believes has pushed policies that hurt working people .\n`` When I vote , I guess I 'm not just voting for a Democrat , I 'm voting for someone that I think would actually help people and make their lives better , '' Sweitzer said .\nYoung voters increase share , but still lag behind older voters\nKawashima-Ginsberg said registration of first-time young voters before 2020 is already one year ahead of a typical cycle , a strong indicator they are already receiving contact from campaigns and advocacy groups .\n`` No question , '' she said , youth turnout will increase from 2016 , when 46 % of eligible voters 18 to 29 voted , according to the U.S. Census .\nIn the 2016 presidential election , voters 18 to 29 years were the only age group to increase their voting rate from 2012 , with a bounce of 1.1 % t , according to Census figures .\nBut Hillary Clinton received a smaller share of the youth vote than Obama . Although she won 55 % of the youth vote , topping Trump 's 40 % , it was a 5-point drop from Obama 's level in 2012 and an 11-point drop from 2008 . To have success against Trump in 2020 , some Democrats say it 's critical to turn that trend around .\nThe caveat : Young people , who historically do n't vote at the same levels as older age groups , remained underrepresented in the 2018 midterms . Despite the gains , young people accounted for just 11 % of the overall vote , even though they accounted for 21 % of all eligible voters and 18 % of registered voters .\nBut young voters made up significant ground . Their share of overall votes cast increased by 4 percentage points from 2014 , while it decreased by 4 percentage points among voters 30 and older .\nIt means young people had greater influence as a voting bloc than past elections , and their influence will expand further in 2020 if that pattern holds .\n`` If we can stay on this trajectory , and use due diligence in supporting young voters and growing voters , I think they will be pivotal , '' Kawashima-Ginsberg said . `` There 's no question about that . I think they will decide the race , starting in the primary . ''\nYouth turnout in 2018 , according to CIRCLE , increased by more than 20 percentage points from 2014 in four states : New Jersey , California , Virginia and Minnesota . The states with the highest youth turnout in 2018 among youth were Minnesota ( 43.7 % ) , Montana ( 42.7 % ) , Colorado ( 40.8 % ) and Oregon ( 39.2 ) .\nMost of these states are considered safe or leaning for Democrats in 2020 . Only Montana voted for Trump in 2016 , although the Trump campaign has targeted Minnesota as a state to pick up .\nErin Perrine , deputy communications director for Trump 's reelection campaign , said the president is `` energizing and engaging voters of all ages , and will do so well past 2020 '' when asked about the surge of young people who voted for Democrats in the midterms .\n`` His common-sense policies coupled with a booming economy has benefited all Americans \u2013 whether you are a college graduate entering the workforce or a retiree whose prescription drug prices have been lowered , this administration has delivered . ''\nShe added : `` We will not only expand on the 2016 electoral map , but we will also increase support across demographics . ''\nCoura Fall , a 19-year-old from American University in Washington , D.C. , who supports Warren , was among the new voters who cast her first ballot in the 2018 midterms . She will be voting absentee next year in Rhode Island . The daughter of undocumented immigrants from Senegal , Fall said Trump 's election was a `` rude awakening '' for young people who thought they were `` living in a post-racial society and everything was going to be great . ''\n`` I just feel like the power to vote is just so important and so massive , '' Fall said , `` and it seems so simple , but like , you literally get to shape your government to what you want it to be , and that 's why I take it so seriously . ''\nMarissa Soltoff , a 22-year-old recent graduate of George Washington University , said she supported Sanders in the 2016 primary and almost cried at Clinton being the nominee but voted for her anyway . This year she 's deciding between Sanders , Warren , Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Kamala Harris .\n\u201c Bernie is the OG , \u201d Soltoff said , adding that she likes candidates who are \u201c not just playing into the establishment that we currently have. \u201d She said each is `` actually fighting for and advocating for real change that \u2019 s actually going to benefit people rather than just the party establishment . ''\nWarren , Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are among campaigns that have national directors devoted solely to the youth vote . Several campaigns have paid staffers in early primary states devoted to student organizers and college outreach . Each touts canvassing efforts aimed at young voters .\nButtigieg , 37 , the youngest candidate in the race , has adopted the tagline a `` new generation of American leadership . '' His campaign credits a CNN town hall performance earlier this year for spawning a `` Students for Pete '' across the country .\nThe Sanders campaign held an online `` summer school '' for more than 1,500 students at 627 colleges and community colleges . It was billed as a two-week crash course on political organizing .\nSimilarly , former Vice President Joe Biden has a Team Joe Organizing Fellowship , an eight-week online program aimed at teaching `` the ins-and-outs of grassroots organizing . ''\nWarren held a conference call with organizers to kick off `` Students With Warren , '' which includes students at high schools , community colleges , universities and graduate schools .\n\u201c This is our moment to dream big , fight hard and win , \u201d Warren told the crowd at last week 's University of New Hampshire town hall .\nShe opened her remarks with a nod to young voters , blasting a new New Hampshire state law , backed by Republican Gov . Chris Sununu , that created tougher voting restrictions . Critics have said it will make it more difficult for out-of-state college students to vote .\n`` I want to say something that I know is very controversial in some places in New Hampshire , like maybe the governor 's office . I believe in the right of every American citizen to vote , including college students . ''\nIn the 2016 Democratic primary , Sanders used a wave of support among youth voters to carry his bid against Clinton . But this time around , support among young voters is more split in the primary , particularly with Warren , polling has shown . Both have pushed socially and economically liberal messages that include eliminating student debt and free college tuition .\nA generational divide dominates Democratic voters , a new New York Times/Siena College poll of Iowa Democrats found , with more than 85 % of voters younger than 30 saying they prefer a candidate promising fundamental change . Seventy percent of voters older than 65 said they want a candidate who will return Washington to normalcy .\nIt helps explain the popularity of Sanders and Warren among young people , whose economic populist messages have also raised questions about their electability in a one-on-one matchup against Trump .\nJoe Calvello , a campaign spokesman for the Sanders campaign , said young people have `` experienced the failures of the current system . '' He said they are `` shackled by student debt , are on track for a lower standard of living than their parents '' and `` know better than anyone how much is at stake in 2020 . ''\n`` We need to nominate a candidate for president that will inspire millions upon millions of young people to be engaged in the political process for the first time , Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that will do that . \u201d\nMarisol Samayoa , Buttigieg 's deputy national press secretary , said `` a real crisis '' faces young people with issues like climate change and voting rights . She said that 's why young people are responding to Buttigieg 's `` platform of structural and generational change . ''\n`` Young voters are done waiting for Washington to act on these issues and Pete \u2019 s the only candidate ready to meet these challenges with the urgency it requires , '' she said .\nA Quinnipiac University national poll in October found that 31 % of Democratic voters ages 18 to 34 support Sanders while 30 % back Warren . Third among young voters in the poll was Buttigieg at 12 % . Biden was at 6 % in the 18-34 category , tied with Harris .\nA recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Suffolk University national poll found Sanders also leading voters ages 18-34 with 23 % , but Biden faring much better , tied with Warren with young voters at 19 % . But the New York Times/Siena College poll painted a troubling picture for Biden in Iowa , including less support among voters 45 or younger than Andrew Yang .\nBiden , who tops his peers significantly in support of people over the age of 65 , pushed back when asked about his lagging support among youth voters during an interview on `` 60 Minutes . '' Some progressive Democrats have warned a Biden nomination would not excite young people like other candidates would .\n`` The fact of the matter is , if you take a look at who votes in these primaries , overwhelmingly people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries , '' Biden said in the interview . He added that he wants people engaged and voting , but criticized proposals such as Medicare for All as relying on `` far-reaching assertions '' that ca n't deliver true change .\nPete Kavanaugh , Biden 's deputy campaign manager , said the campaign is going to compete for every vote and takes youth organizing `` very seriously . ''\n`` Are there going to be some variants in polling across ages and demographics ? '' Kavanaugh said . `` Sure , but I think we are making very concerted efforts to reach out to younger voters and I think we 're beginning to see the fruits of that labor , especially when we 're able to engage with students in a one-on-one setting .
