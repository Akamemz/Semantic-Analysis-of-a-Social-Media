A recently enacted Alabama law has been described as the nation \u2019 s most restrictive , and several other states also have passed new restrictions on abortion with an eye toward giving the Supreme Court a chance to overturn its decision in Roe .\nAs the debate over abortion continues , here are five key facts about Americans \u2019 views on the topic , based on recent \u2588\u2588\u2588 polling :\n1About six-in-ten U.S. adults ( 61 % ) said in a 2019 survey that abortion should be legal in all or most cases , compared with 38 % who said it should be illegal all or most of the time . On both sides of the issue , Americans are more likely than not to leave room for exceptions , with more saying abortion should be legal or illegal most of the time , rather than always . Public support for legal abortion remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling , and there is virtually no difference between the views of men and women .\n2 There is a substantial \u2013 and growing \u2013 partisan divide on abortion , with Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to support legal abortion in all or most cases ( 82 % vs. 36 % ) . There also are large gaps based on religious affiliation . For example , three-quarters of white evangelical Protestants ( 77 % ) say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , while an even larger share of religiously unaffiliated Americans ( 83 % ) take the opposing view , saying that abortion should be mostly or entirely legal .\n3 When it comes to the Supreme Court \u2019 s 1973 landmark abortion ruling , seven-in-ten Americans ( 70 % ) in the 2019 survey said Roe v.
