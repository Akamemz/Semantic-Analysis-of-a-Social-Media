    "content": "Senator Rand Paul is an expert at exploiting controversial public policy issues in order to garner personal publicity . Like his famously opportunistic father , former Texas Congressman Ron Paul , his modus operandi invariably involves parroting the Democrats , disparaging his own party , and pandering to the media . Thus we find the Kentucky senator accusing House Speaker Paul Ryan and other responsible Republicans of secretly conspiring to impose \u201c Obamacare Lite \u201d on the electorate . This is nonsense , but his rhetoric fits the \u201c GOP divided on repeal \u201d narrative peddled by the Democrats and press , so Grandstand Rand is getting a lot of \u201c earned \u201d coverage .\nPaul \u2019 s latest publicity stunt , as Speaker Ryan accurately characterized it , was to hold a news conference outside a Capitol Hill meeting room where work was scheduled to be done on an Obamacare replacement bill by members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . He conflated their deliberations with tactics used by the Democrats to get the law passed : \u201c When Obamacare was passed in 2009 and 2010 , Nancy Pelosi said you \u2019 ll know what \u2019 s in it after you pass it . The Republican Party shouldn \u2019 t act in the same way. \u201d This cynical description of the committee \u2019 s work confirms Paul as a publicity hound and a brazen hypocrite , as well .\nWhen he had a real chance to do something about genuine Obamacare skulduggery , in April of 2015 , Senator Paul actually colluded with the Democrats . One of the most disgraceful episodes in the sorry saga of this health-care \u201c reform \u201d law involves a falsified document submitted to the D.C. Small Business Exchange enabling members of Congress and their staffers to receive subsidies to which they are not legally entitled . The chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee tried to subpoena the exchange for an unredacted copy of that document to see who falsified it . Paul voted with the Democrats to quash the subpoena .\nAnd we now find the very same man who helped keep illegal subsidies in place for himself and his staff , sanctimoniously denouncing Speaker Ryan for merely discussing the inclusion of tax credits in an Obamacare replacement bill : \u201c Obamacare had subsidies \u2014 if we call them refundable tax credits , have we really done anything other than change the name ? \u201d It is little wonder that the members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are reluctant to give him access to the replacement plan .
