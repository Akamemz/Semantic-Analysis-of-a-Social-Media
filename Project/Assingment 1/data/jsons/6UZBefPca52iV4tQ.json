''\nAnd he called other accusations by Ryan `` a bunch of stuff . ''\nBiden went where President Barack Obama would n't last week in his debate with Romney , bringing up Romney 's `` 47 % '' controversy as well as the Republican nominee 's tax rate .\nAnd later , when Ryan discussed President John F. Kennedy 's tax policies , Biden fired back : `` Oh , now you 're Jack Kennedy ? ''\n`` The vice president came and showed fight .

''\nPeople apparently rushed to their computers to find out . `` Malarkey , '' it turns out , was the third-most-searched debate-related term of the night on Google .

But Biden did what he needed to do.\n\n2. Too much Joe?\n\nIf Biden was on a mission to bring the fight to Ryan, then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president.\n\nMoments into the debate, Biden went on the attack.\n\n\"On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake,\" said Biden.\n\nMinutes later the vice president pushed back against criticism by the Wisconsin congressman, saying \"not a single thing he said is accurate.\"\n\nAnd he called other accusations by Ryan \"a bunch of stuff.\"\n\nBiden went where President Barack Obama wouldn't last week in his debate with Romney, bringing up Romney's \"47%\" controversy as well as the Republican nominee's tax rate.\n\nAnd later, when Ryan discussed President John F. Kennedy's tax policies, Biden fired back: \"Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?\"\n\n\"The vice president came and showed fight.

They expect that,\" Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said. \"I think that authenticity is something that people appreciate.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign disagreed.\n\n\"The sighing, the eye-rolling, the grinning.

The Biden dismissive laughs, the interruptions, the sort of shouting, I think that Ryan was calmer and frankly more presidential.\"\n\nWhat did debate watchers think? Seven out of 10 debate watchers in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Biden was the aggressor.\n\n3. Does the debate even matter?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nPeople don't vote for vice presidents at the ballot box. They vote for presidents. Past vice presidential debates, no matter how high the drama, have ultimately done little to move the needle in modern elections.\n\nNot surprisingly, Biden's scenery-chewing performance was viewed differently by both campaigns. The Romney campaign said he looked erratic, rude and unhinged. The Obama campaign said he laid out the facts and made Ryan look, in the spin room words of former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, \"like a lightweight.\"\n\nBut a common refrain from both campaigns after the debate was that it will probably have a minimal effect on the race one way or the other.\n\nThe biggest impact of the night, and the reason Democrats were ebullient after the debate, was the base-rallying impact of Biden's aggressive and blustery stage presence.\n\nIn the wake of Obama's wilting flower routine in last week's debate, the full Biden, exasperated and angry with Romney and Ryan, was just what Democrats needed.\n\nHow happy was team Obama? Campaign surrogates stayed in the spin room with puffed chests for much longer than they did in Denver, when they offered dubious messaging before escaping. The campaign immediately sent out a fundraising plea. President Obama put himself in front of cameras after landing at Andrews Air Force Base to praise Biden's performance.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the Obama camp.\n\nDemocratic state parties, liberal interest groups and down-ballot campaigns rushed to send out fundraising e-mails to capitalize on a fired-up base. You didn't see much of the same on the Republican side.\n\nThe debate launched a fresh news cycle that will put a temporary halt to the \"Chicago in disarray\" storylines. Now the pressure is on President Obama to keep that narrative going next week in New York.\n\n4. Ryan rises to challenge\n\nIt was arguably Ryan's biggest task in the vice presidential debate.\n\nAs the running mate to the Republican challenger, Ryan needed to convey that he's fit to serve should something happen to the commander in chief, that he would be acceptable to Americans as president.\n\nKnown as an expert on economic and budget issues, early in the debate Ryan showed his smarts on foreign policy. During a discussion on troop drawdowns in Afghanistan, he explained how the seasonal changes affect the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down,\" explained Ryan.\n\n\"And so when Adm. Mullen and Gen.

That's the problem.\"\n\n\"I think Ryan proved himself unexpectedly competent on foreign policy,\" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, who worked for Romney's 2008 presidential bid. \"I think Ryan met his test tonight.

Did Ryan pass the competency test?\n\nSix out of 10 debate watchers in the CNN/ORC poll conducted said that Ryan is qualified to be president.\n\n5. Malarkey moves numbers\n\n\"Malarkey\" is one of Biden's favorite Biden-isms.\n\nHe's been saying it for decades, but not usually with the kind of gusto he showed on Thursday before millions of prime time television viewers.\n\nSoon after the debate began, when Ryan criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy, Biden fired back: \"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\"\n\nWhat does malarkey mean?\n\nPeople apparently rushed to their computers to find out. \"Malarkey,\" it turns out, was the third-most-searched debate-related term of the night on Google. It was also trending on Twitter for a good chunk of time.\n\nFor the record: it's basically the Irish-American term for \"nonsense.\"\n\nAccording to Google, the other top searches during the debate were \"Biden,\" \"conflating,\" \"Who is winning the debate\" and \"How old is Paul Ryan.\"",
