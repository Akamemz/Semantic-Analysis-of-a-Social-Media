    "content": "Some conservatives will bristle at Romney 's assertion that `` both President Obama and I care about poor and middle class families . '' Democrats rarely afford Republicans this benefit of the doubt . Indeed , they often say that Republicans hate the poor and want to decimate the middle class -- all for the nefarious purpose of enriching their `` millionaire and billionaire '' buddies . This has been a central thrust of Obamaworld 's attacks on Mitt Romney over the last year . They 've falsely claimed that he outsourced American jobs while bankrupting domestic companies . They 've wrongly alleged that he intends to slam the middle class with tax increases ( something Obama has actually done ) . They 've even baselessly suggested that Romney is a felon , and stood behind an infamous ad that conveys the distinct impression that Romney was complicit in a woman 's death . They 've done all this , mind you , while swearing up and down that they 're all about the facts . But the reality is that Romney does himself no good by slinging mud of his own at this stage . He has to persuade people to support him , which entails convincing undecided voters -- the majority of whom are ripe for the picking , demographically -- to show up and vote .\nThat 's why this ad focuses on outcomes over feelings . By conceding up front that both he and Obama care about people , he is able to shift the discussion to which candidate is best equipped to affect positive change for the groups in question . He points out that poverty and food stamp usage rates have soared to new highs under the current president . He strips away the fanciful and counter-productive liberal conceit that government spending and programs are the definition of `` compassion . '' True compassion , he argues , comes from delivering economic prosperity and growth such that people can break loose from government help or dependency and take control of their own destiny . And he notes that middle income Americans have seen their take home pay fall during this president 's term . In fact , household incomes have fallen faster during the Obama `` recovery '' than during the recession he constantly reminds us he inherited . He closes by making the case that `` we ca n't afford another four years like the last four years . ''\nThis is the first Romney spot I can recall that features the candidate talking directly to home viewers . The Obama campaign deployed this method a few months ago , when the president was trying to convince Americans that his `` you did n't build that '' remarks were taken out of context . The goal of those ads was to stop the bleeding . Does Romney have his own seepage to stanch these days ? A flurry of new polls look rather grim for the Republican ticket . Gallup 's latest daily tracker shows a recent Obama bounce ( I guess weak and dishonest responses to an ongoing international crises plays well with registered voters ) , with the incumbent jumping out to a six-point lead . Less than a week ago , the poll was tied at 47 percent . A trio of new surveys from CBS/NYT/Quinnipiac basically say `` game over '' in Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida . The polls put Obama ahead by ten , twelve , and nine points , respectively . These results suggest that Obama will add to his ten-point Keystone State win in 2008 , more than double his victory margin in Ohio , and triple it in Florida . ( Does anyone believe that ? )\nRasmussen 's national daily tracker has Romney and Obama tied at 46 today , with Romney leading 48-46 when `` leaners '' are included . I suspect we 'll see Gallup trend back toward a virtual tie in the coming days , which is where they 've measured the race for months -- with a few big blips in each direction . It is impossible for the national race to be tied , or even close to tied , if Obama is really leading big in places like Florida and Ohio . For some perspective , two other Florida polls released this week have pointed to a one-point race ; Obama led in one , Romney in the other .

This is why our statewide polls conducted every month since the primaries shows the President failing to hit fifty percent in most key measurements like favorable name ID , job approval and his ballot score .
