And more than seven in 10 say that airstrikes would not achieve significant goals for the U.S .\nAnd while most of those questioned said that how their members of Congress voted on the resolution would n't affect how they voted in future elections , but the remainder by a nearly 3-1 margin said they would be more likely to vote against the lawmakers if they supported the resolution .\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International on September 6-8 , with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .",
