    "content": "Many Democratic strategists and elected officials in Texas have joined their national comrades fretting over the prospect of Bernie Sanders as the Democrats \u2019 standard bearer in their crusade to prevent Donald Trump \u2019 s reelection . The concerns have been particularly acute as anti-Sanders Texas Democrats worry over the party \u2019 s prospects for flipping congressional and state legislative seats . The common denominator in the fretting \u2014 captured in recent Texas Tribune story featuring interviews with Democratic elected officials and consultants \u2014 is that Sanders is too far to the left of the Texas Democratic electorate .\nBut Sanders is as much an expression of changing conditions as he is an agent of change . As Sanders might be quick to paraphrase , he may be making history , but as a group , Texas Democrats have gotten more liberal over the last decade . Data from the most recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll reveals the splash Sanders makes in the ideological currents defining Texas \u2019 Democratic Party , while a larger body of UT/TT Poll data over the last 10 years shows the share of self-identified liberals gradually but steadily increasing as Texas Democrats increasingly reflect the national ideological sorting of voters between the two major parties .\nSupport for the most progressive candidates in the most recent UT/Texas Tribune Poll comes from expected constituencies among Texas Democrats . Among self-identified liberals , 31 % of Democrats preferred Sanders , while 22 % preferred Elizabeth Warren . Among those who identified as \u201c extremely liberal , \u201d most preferred either Sanders ( 45 % ) or Warren ( 30 % ) . Sanders was the top choice of Democratic primary voters under 40 ( 34 % ) , followed at some distance by Warren ( 13 % ) . The top choice of voters over 40 was Joe Biden .\nBiden continues to lead Sanders in Texas among Democrats age 45 and older , while Sanders is by far the most favored candidate among voters under 30 . As Democrats vow yet again to tip the partisan balance by bringing new , young voters to the polls , those voters remain a small share of overall turnout , even as they become a larger part of the electorate . Of course , should Sanders falter or have the nomination wrested from him , the fear that his young followers will turn out for another candidate is real \u2014 as is the expectation that they will turn out in droves if he is in fact the nominee .\nSanders has less than majority support in a crowded field in which the votes for Democratic moderates are divided among several candidates , as his skeptics note . The primacy of the divided moderate vote is the foundation for the argument \u2014now back in vogue after Biden \u2019 s \u201c firewall \u201d win in South Carolina and Pete Buttigieg \u2019 s decision to suspend his campaign \u2014 that consolidation behind Biden will reassert a center-left Democratic majority . In the UT/TT Poll , Biden ran first among moderates ( 27 % ) followed by Michael Bloomberg with 16 % \u2014with Sanders in third with 12 % .\nHowever , trend data over the last 10 years shows the share of moderates in the Texas Democratic Party declining at the same time as the share of liberals increased . Between 2008 and 2016 , the share of Democrats who identified as \u201c liberal \u201d was just under 47 % . In polling from 2017 through 2019 , the average increased 12 percentage points , to 59 % . In the same time frames , the number of moderates declined from an average of 46 % in polls from 2008 to 2016 , to an average of 29 % in polling conducted between 2017 and 2019 . In the most recent UT/TT Poll , 64 % of Democrats identified as liberal , compared with only 27 % who identified as moderate . In October 2012 , right before Barack Obama \u2019 s reelection ( in which he lost Texas by 12 percentage points ) , 43 % of Texas Democrats identified as liberal , 45 % as moderate .\nAs the moderate presence has given way to a larger share of liberals , liberal Democrats have also become more intense in their liberalism . Among Democrats who identified as liberal in the February 2014 UT/TT Poll , 20 % leaned liberal , 17 % described themselves as \u201c somewhat liberal , \u201d and 9 % as \u201c extremely liberal. \u201d Six years later , in February 2020 , 16 % leaned liberal , 29 % were somewhat liberal , and 19 % were \u201c extremely liberal. \u201d The average percentage of Democrats who described themselves as \u201c extremely liberal \u201d in UT/TT polling from 2014 and 2015 was 11.5 % ; in 2018 and 2019 polls , the average increased to 21.5 % .\nA different look at the ideological preferences in the most prominent quarters of the Texas Democratic electorate offers some surprises about where this liberalism resides within the party .\nA recurring question in UT/TT polling channels Goldilocks to ask Democrats whether they think Democratic elected officials in Texas are too liberal , not liberal enough , or liberal enough : 44 % said Democratic elected officials were not liberal enough , only 6 % said they were too liberal , and 30 % said they were just right . While this isn \u2019 t a direct measure of support for the Democratic socialist Sanders , who is definitely not a Texas elected official and is arguably beyond the normal description of \u201c liberal , \u201d it does bear on the broad judgment of Democratic consultants and candidates wringing their hands about Sanders \u2019 potential impact on \u201c their \u201d voters .\nThe biggest gap in Democrats \u2019 assessments of their elected officials \u2019 liberalism is by race : 58 % of white Democrats want them more liberal , compared with 39 % of Latinos and 26 % of African American Democrats . In the suburbs , where professional Democrats seem to most fear Sanders \u2019 destructive impact on their prospects , 46 % of Democratic voters find their elected officials insufficiently liberal \u2014 slightly higher than urban Democrats ( 43 % ) . There is no appreciable difference between older and younger Democrats on this measure . Those with college degrees were somewhat more likely to draw the same conclusion than those without , but not by a wide margin ( 40 % and 49 % , respectively ) .\nThis intersection of racial and generational tensions within the Democratic coalition \u2014 evident in the results and the exit polling in South Carolina , where older black voters fueled Biden \u2019 s victory\u2014 is evident in Texas , too . While sample sizes prevent confident slicing of the UT/TT data by party , age and race , Sanders \u2019 and Biden \u2019 s division of Latino and black primary voters in the UT/TT Poll and most other Texas polling suggests white liberals and younger black and Latino Democrats are inclined to support more aggressively progressive candidates .\nWhite urban liberals \u2019 embrace of Sanders coexists uneasily with the centrality of black and Latino voting blocs , which are demonstrably less enthused about Bernie \u2019 s revolution \u2014 but also , taken together , are historically more likely to show up to vote . A Sanders nomination would test the durability of these voters \u2019 partisan commitments in the general election , much as the nomination of almost any other candidate would test the party loyalties of Sanders \u2019 youthful followers .
