As both offices and schools go remote , working parents \u2019 balancing act has become even more difficult . Employees \u2019 \u201c double lives \u201d as parents are now out in the open \u2013 and testing fault lines around divisions of labor , employer expectations , and gender stereotypes . But this new terrain is also presenting opportunities for people to rethink their ideas about what it means to be a working parent , or employ one , and possibly identify longer-term shifts that could benefit all .\nKids crawling into Zoom calls . Colleagues \u2019 pets barking in the background . Trying to juggle your child \u2019 s algebra questions \u2013 and your budget report due at noon .\nThree years ago , when the now viral video hit the internet of a father in a live television interview interrupted by two stumbling toddlers , professionals with kids around the globe laughed tears of schadenfreude .\nBut today , as schools and day cares are canceled , and governments worldwide encourage \u2013 or require \u2013 citizens to remain home to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus , the risk of their own client calls or video-conferences getting interrupted by crying kids or exasperated teens is exponentially high . So high , in fact , there are photos and videos posted online from late-night comedy hosts , university professors , local news anchors , and even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ( in self-quarantine ) documenting the juggle of their \u201c day jobs \u201d with their now ever-evident roles as parents .\nWorking from home while children are present is extremely challenging . For some families , it \u2019 s near impossible . Already the global lockdowns are testing fault lines around familial divisions of labor , employer expectations , gender stereotypes , and parental patience . But at this unique moment , it \u2019 s largely understood that if you have kids and are able to work remotely , the two worlds will collide . And that presents opportunities for employers and employees to rethink their perceptions about working parents , and possibly identify longer-term shifts that could benefit all .\nOnce we ease out of this crisis , \u201c people are not going to want to work in the same way \u201d they did before , says Deborah Croft , co-founder of Thriving Talent , a European company helping businesses and organizations meet their gender diversity goals . \u201c People are going to be asking for different ways of working because they will have done it \u201d and seen that it can work .\nLauren Romansky from Acton , Massachusetts , regularly works remotely for a research and consulting firm based in Connecticut .\nNow , with day care shuttered , Ms. Romansky and her husband trade off shifts of work and child care for their 2- and 4-year-old daughters , finishing up what remains after the kids are in bed . It makes for incredibly long days .\n\u201c What I \u2019 ve been trying to explain to a bunch of my colleagues who aren \u2019 t used to working remotely is this is not business as usual even just in terms of remote work , \u201d says Ms. Romansky .\nShe thinks it \u2019 s too early to tell what impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on perceptions of working parents . But her daughters have been more visible to her colleagues than they normally are , which she embraces .\nIn part , that visibility is intentional . Her department started a daily optional exercise class that staff \u2013 and their families or roommates or pets \u2013 are invited to join .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c a really great way to authorize everyone to recognize that we \u2019 re all working in different circumstances and it doesn \u2019 t have to be something we \u2019 re ashamed of or is a problem , \u201d she says of the realities and responsibilities each person is juggling .\nFor Jamie Schroeder , a business operations manager for Google in Mountain View , California , kids showing up on team video calls has become something of a norm . \u201c There \u2019 s lots of babies in the background that you hear , but it feels very empowering and [ there \u2019 s ] a supportive dynamic about it , \u201d she says , adding that she doesn \u2019 t rush to mute her computer when her 16-month-old makes a peep .\n\u201c Most organizations are really trying to do something to make it easier \u201d for parents now working from home with the added stresses of child care and schooling , says Ms. Croft . \u201c It is teleworking where you are going to have children popping out and coming through the door . It \u2019 s going to be chaotic and there is an acceptance of the fact that that is the case . \u201d\nDominique Soguel Julia Rous talks with her son as he draws birds of prey during a holiday in the British countryside in 2018 . Today , amid the COVID-19 pandemic , Ms. Rous has found it challenging to convey to her children that `` no school '' does n't mean `` vacation '' in terms of how they spend their days .\nSome 56 % of parents who also work professionally say it \u2019 s difficult to balance the responsibilities of work and family , according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey . Parents often feel pressure to hide their \u201c double lives \u201d as caregivers from their employers , whether due to personal fears or long-established stigmas , experts say . Seventy-four percent of parents with kids under the age of 18 say they sometimes feel too busy to enjoy life , according to a 2018 Pew survey .\nAnd that was all before most parents lost their child care amid the coronavirus crisis \u2013 child care that , even in \u201c normal \u201d times , is often excessively expensive . In every U.S. state , the cost of infant and toddler child care exceeds the federal definition of \u201c affordable , \u201d according to the Center for American Progress . On average , families in high-income countries around the world spend 14.5 % of their income on child care , but those living in New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and the United States can expect to spend closer to one-third .\n\u201c The crisis has made this much clearer that these are universal problems that nearly all families are facing , \u201d says Kathleen Gerson , a sociology professor at New York University who studies gender , work , and families .\n\u201c Now we can see how essential it is , both economically , and for personal well-being \u2013 and for family well-being \u2013 that we address the caregiving crisis in [ our ] society , \u201d she says .\nAlready , the disruptions in some parents \u2019 lives are translating into hopes of more permanent shifts down the line .\n\u201c My view of working from home has changed a lot , \u201d says Karla Martinez de Salas , editor in chief of Vogue Mexico and Latin America , who had never tried it before the pandemic .\nIn \u201c normal \u201d times , she is required to travel frequently for work , and returned from a trip to Italy in early March . That meant two weeks of self-quarantine , which she discovered was a \u201c blessing in disguise \u201d because of the time it allowed her to spend with her twin 4-year-old daughters .\n\u201c As [ the girls ] get older , it \u2019 s harder and harder to be away . So , perhaps working from [ home ] once or twice a week would be the ideal scenario for a mom like me , \u201d she says .\nWith the COVID-19 crisis \u201c we have accelerated that whole question mark of can we or can \u2019 t we do flexible working \u2013 because you have to , \u201d says Ms. Croft from Thriving Talent .\nCarlos Taboada , a human resources consultant in Monterrey , Mexico , and father of two , says he never liked the idea of his team members working remotely .\n\u201c I \u2019 m the worst at home office .
