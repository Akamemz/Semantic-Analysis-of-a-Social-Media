POLITICO Pro GOP avoids showdown over EPA climate change rules\n\nRepublicans\u2019 aggressive energy agenda has so far conspicuously sidestepped one of their biggest campaign-trail targets: the climate change rules from President Barack Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe House GOP plans to steer clear of a showdown over the greenhouse gas rules in a broad energy package that it will unveil this week, raising questions about whether Republicans are grasping for a workable plan to stop the carbon dioxide regulations that EPA will issue later this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the Senate, GOP leaders avoided a fight over Obama\u2019s climate change rules during January\u2019s long debate over Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whose panel is in charge of EPA funding, has vowed to push a new energy bill that\u2019s \u201cnot a messaging\u201d exercise, a comment that suggests she won\u2019t pick a political fight over climate change just yet \u2014 though she also has additional leverage over EPA given her leading role in writing the agency\u2019s spending bill.\n\nOne GOP source with knowledge of the party\u2019s strategy said there is \u201can obvious lack of enthusiasm among Republican staff, and maybe members, too, to do something on\u201d the power-plant emissions rules that EPA is set to finalize this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of \u2018yay, I\u2019m superexcited\u2019 on this.\u201d\n\nIn public, however, Republicans vow that they\u2019re committed to fighting what they have long savaged as Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan, who left the emissions rules out of his massive new bill, wrote via email that \u201cin addition to this energy package, we plan to move forward with an aggressive agenda to address EPA\u2019s overreach.\u201d\n\nThe new EPA rules would set carbon dioxide targets for states, requiring them to submit plans to trim emissions of the gas blamed for changing the planet\u2019s climate. And they would set tight limits on pollution from new power plants that could prevent any new coal-fired generation from being built.\n\nEPA\u2019s timing for releasing their rules may be the biggest reason for Republicans\u2019 go-slow approach.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Environment and Public Works Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma have cited the Congressional Review Act \u2014 which successfully stopped one executive-branch regulation in 2001 \u2014 as a viable method for undercutting EPA. But an attack using CRA would have to wait until the emissions rules are final later this year.\n\nWhether through stand-alone legislation or the CRA, any congressional challenge to EPA is likely to draw a presidential veto. While Republicans have also warned they would use the government funding process to cripple the Obama climate rule, that could trigger a showdown with the White House over who would take the blame for shutting down the agency.\n\nAnd the current impasse over Department of Homeland Security funding that is tied to conservative anger over Obama\u2019s immigration policy holds a lesson for the GOP: Even Senate Democrats who may share their desire to defang EPA and its climate agenda can\u2019t be counted on to support a funding bill that would force policy changes on the president.\n\n\u201cNo matter the issue, if the Republicans threaten to shut down all or part of the government unless they get their way, Democrats and, more importantly, the American people overwhelmingly reject it,\u201d one Senate Democratic leadership aide said.\n\n\u201cTrying to put us in a box only strengthens the resolve of our members, no matter if it\u2019s on Obamacare, immigration, the EPA or anything else. If they try it again on EPA, they\u2019ll find out that the third time isn\u2019t the charm,\u201d the aide added.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, doesn\u2019t appear to be enthusiastic about challenging the EPA power plant rules in her broad energy bill that will address issues from opening new areas to oil and gas exploration to strengthening the nation\u2019s power grid.\n\nThe Alaskan, who is also the top appropriator for EPA and the Interior Department, predicted she would spend \u201ca lot of time\u201d this year trying to navigate attempts \u201cto load this particular bill with a lot of clever ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to be working aggressively every step of the way to put together a bill that\u2019s responsive and is something we can gain support for passage [of] \u2014 not a messaging bill, but support for passage,\u201d Murkowski told reporters on Thursday. The newest member of her EPA spending panel is McConnell, who cruised to reelection in November with a promise to defend the coal industry from the tighter regulations proposed by the Obama administration.\n\nMurkowski spokesman Robert Dillon said the Alaskan would work with McConnell and others on a bill that meaningfully reins in what Republicans slam as across-the-board regulatory overreach by EPA and the Interior Department. \u201cHer goal is not to wind up with a presidential veto, however, as that would only perpetuate the status quo and allow their actions to stand uncontested,\u201d Dillon said by email. \u201cShe is already working to put together a bill that the president will have no choice but to sign \u2014 because enough members of the Senate are convinced of its merits.\u201d\n\nBut rhetoric aside, the path for opponents to challenge the EPA rules is far from clear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the Hill has settled in on a strategy,\u201d said Tom Pyle, president of the industry-backed American Energy Alliance. After EPA finishes its rule, he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure Sen. McConnell will want to move on the CRA, and, notwithstanding Sen. Murkowski\u2019s comments, there is going to be an attempt\u201d to use spending bills to try to halt the power-plant regulations.\n\nThe GOP source with knowledge of the party\u2019s EPA strategy agreed with Pyle on one thing: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s got the right answer yet\u201d on the best way to undercut the EPA regulations.\n\nAt the moment, the source added, House Republicans are \u201cskittering away from anything controversial because they want to get Democrats.\u201d\n\nAside from the DHS funding fight, Republicans\u2019 struggle to unify behind an idea to fulfill the second half of their \u201crepeal and replace\u201d mantra on Obamacare also signals the party\u2019s challenge in taking on EPA.\n\nOne troubling omen for the GOP: Several Republicans voted for measures backing climate change science during last month\u2019s Keystone XL debate, and five agreed with Democrats that humans \u201csignificantly\u201d affect the climate.\n\nThose votes chipped away at the party\u2019s rhetorical wall on the issue, and gave greens hope they can challenge the GOP on industrial pollution.\n\nRepublicans are realizing \u201cthat just being against something starts wearing very thin, but actually figuring out what to do\u201d is another, bigger challenge, Natural Resources Defense Council government affairs director David Goldston said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an alternative, you have to have unity to do it,\u201d Goldston added. \u201cThey\u2019ve got too many hard-liners who don\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d\n\nAlthough Goldston said he had \u201ca feeling that [Republicans] are on the ropes, both procedurally and substantively,\u201d neither he nor fellow environmentalist Tiernan Sittenfeld expect Republicans to end their quest to block Obama\u2019s emissions rules for power plants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think the Republican leadership has finally gotten the message that blocking the EPA\u2019s common-sense proposal to protect public health by cutting carbon pollution from coal-burning power plants is widely out of step with what their constituents want,\u201d said Sittenfeld, senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cBut if past is prologue, it\u2019s probably just a matter of time before they try again.\u201d",
