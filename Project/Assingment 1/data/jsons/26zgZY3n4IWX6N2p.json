REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\n\nTrump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nSince then, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated.\n\n\u201cWe are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance,\u201d said Bryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under Obamacare.\n\nTrump, who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a \u201cdisaster,\u201d has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies.\n\nBy law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.\n\nAnticipating Trump\u2019s move, insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in 2018 to recoup the money. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates \u2013 a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.\n\nLAST WORD ON SUBSIDIES?\n\nThe fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on Thursday. A senior White House aide said that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.\n\nA California court is expected to consider on Monday a request by Democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to Trump\u2019s decision is resolved.\n\nIf the funding is not restored when 2018 enrollment opens on Nov. 1, many consumers will see premium rates that are on average 20 percent higher than they would have been otherwise.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s decision on the subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office said the Republican president\u2019s policies to roll back Obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to 4 million fewer people signing up for insurance in 2018 than previously forecast.

Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.\n\nShould the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cA midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,\u201d said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. \u201cIntermountain Healthcare would pursue this.\u201d\n\nWashington state\u2019s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
