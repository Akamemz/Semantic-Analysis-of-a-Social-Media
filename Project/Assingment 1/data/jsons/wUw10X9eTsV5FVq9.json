It 's believed to be the first autopsy series on African Americans whose cause of death was attributed to COVID-19 , according to the study , which was published Wednesday in monthly scientific journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine .\n`` We found that the small vessels and capillaries in the lungs were obstructed by blood clots and associated hemorrhage that significantly contributed to decompensation and death in these patients , '' Dr. Richard Vander Heide , head of pathology research at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine , said in a statement . `` We also found elevated levels of D-dimers -- fragments of proteins involved in breaking down blood clots . What we did not see was myocarditis , or inflammation of the heart muscle , that early reports suggested significantly contributes to death from COVID-19 . ''\nThe small vessel clotting is a new finding that appears to be specific to COVID-19 , according to the study .\nThe 10 deceased patients were black men and women between the ages of 40 and 70 , many of whom had a history of hypertension , obesity , diabetes and chronic kidney disease . In all cases , the patients had experienced sudden respiratory decompensation or collapse at home approximately three to seven days after developing a mild cough and fever .\nThe new findings come after some U.S. states released mortality data based on race and ethnicity that show the novel coronavirus kills black Americans at a disproportionately high rate .\n`` Our study presents a large series of autopsies within a specific demographic experiencing the highest rate of adverse outcomes within the United States , '' said Dr. Sharon Fox , another co-author of the study .",

However, the overall tally is still considerably lower than many other nations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere were also 8,915 new cases of COVID-19 registered in Russia over the last 24 hours, placing country's count at 379,051.\n\nVehicles spray disinfectant while sanitizing a road amid the novel coronavirus outbreak in Moscow, Russia, on May 28, 2020. Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nThe latest daily caseload is down from a peak of 11,656 new infections reported on May 11, during which Russia registered over 10,000 new cases per day over a 12-day period. Since then, the daily number of new infections has hovered around 9,000 per day.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin began easing the nationwide lockdown earlier this month, despite a rising number of cases at the time.\n\nLast weekend, Brazil surpassed Russia as the country with the second-highest number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the world, behind the United States, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n5:12 a.m.: Brazil's president says Trump is sending hydroxychloroquine tablets\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump is sending over 2 million tablets of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine.\n\nBolsonaro, a close ally of Trump, made the comment while speaking to a small group of supporters as well as members of the press outside the presidential palace in the capital Brasilia.\n\n\"[Trump] is sending us, here, 2 million hydroxychloroquine tablets,\" Bolsonaro said, without offering further details.\n\nA Brazilian source told ABC News that the deal is still being negotiated.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro waves during a demonstration in favor of his government amid the coronavirus pandemic in front of Planalto Palace in the capital, Brasilia, May 24, 2020.

The findings, published last Friday in The Lancet medical journal, prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID0-19.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump suspended travel to the United States from Brazil as the South American country emerged as a new hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic. The new rule does not affect trade between the two nations.\n\nBrazil now has the second-highest number of diagnosed cases of COVID-19, behind the United States.\n\n3:50 a.m.: Blood clots clogged lungs of African American coronavirus victims, study finds\n\nAutopsies on 10 African American patients who died from COVID-19 show their lungs were filled with blood clots, according to a new study.\n\nThe autopsies were performed at University Medical Center in New Orleans by a team of pathologists from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. It's believed to be the first autopsy series on African Americans whose cause of death was attributed to COVID-19, according to the study, which was published Wednesday in monthly scientific journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\n\n\"We found that the small vessels and capillaries in the lungs were obstructed by blood clots and associated hemorrhage that significantly contributed to decompensation and death in these patients,\" Dr. Richard Vander Heide, head of pathology research at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, said in a statement. \"We also found elevated levels of D-dimers -- fragments of proteins involved in breaking down blood clots. What we did not see was myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, that early reports suggested significantly contributes to death from COVID-19.\"\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 21, 2020, a mother and daughter pray as paramedics and firefighters with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department prepare to transport the confirmed COVID-19 patient (left) in Glen Burnie, a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland.

In all cases, the patients had experienced sudden respiratory decompensation or collapse at home approximately three to seven days after developing a mild cough and fever.\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 13, 2020, firefighters and paramedics with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department transport a patient on a stretcher in Glen Burnie, a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland.

Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe new findings come after some U.S. states released mortality data based on race and ethnicity that show the novel coronavirus kills black Americans at a disproportionately high rate.\n\n\"Our study presents a large series of autopsies within a specific demographic experiencing the highest rate of adverse outcomes within the United States,\" said Dr. Sharon Fox, another co-author of the study.\n\nABC News' Matt Claiborne, Anne Flaherty, Aicha El Hammar, Ahmad Hemingway, Alina Lobzina, Bonnie Mclean, Kirit Radia and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",
