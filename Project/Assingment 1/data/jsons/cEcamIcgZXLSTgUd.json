He \u2019 s released inmates early , freeing those with fewer than 30 days left to serve . Deputies are arresting fewer people , with offenders who would see their bail set at $ 50,000 or less given citations .\nFor an incarcerated person , visits from family and friends are \u201c like life support , \u201d says Jeremiah Bourgeois .\nThose visits , he continues , \u201c help you maintain your humanity \u201d \u2013 and he would know , having spent 27 years in prison in Washington state .\nBut when the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic March 11 , those visits were one of the first things to stop . As tough as it is on incarcerated people and their families , it will protect public health , experts say . Mr. Bourgeois admits that , at first , he didn \u2019 t see it that way .\n\u201c I thought it was more a matter of not wanting the virus to come out of the prisons , \u201d rather than protecting those inside , he says . \u201c I \u2019 m so used to people not caring about what happens to prisoners . \u201d\nThe pandemic that has infected more than 400,000 people around the world and brought the global economy to a near standstill is reshaping society in dramatic ways . How Americans think and care about prisoners is one of them .\nThere are 2.3 million people behind bars \u2013 many of them older and infirm , many without access to good medical care \u2013 and they have lived out of sight and out of mind for most Americans . But with the coronavirus crisis , conditions behind bars are now a public health priority .\nAlready , states are taking steps to release certain inmates from jails to lower their risk of exposure .\nNew Jersey is releasing 1,000 prisoners from jails this week , by order of the state Supreme Court chief justice , following similar moves in California . The intake and transfer of inmates and juveniles into California 's correctional facilities has also been temporarily halted , with them staying in county custody for the next 30 days instead . New York City is releasing 300 nonviolent inmates from Rikers Island , after 38 prisoners and employees tested positive at the jail . Iowa , meanwhile , is expediting the release of about 700 people who have already been cleared for parole or work release .\nOn Monday , 14 senators sent a bipartisan letter to the Trump administration , asking it to quickly transfer to home confinement eligible , nonviolent federal inmates who are deemed at high risk for COVID-19 .\nAnd as more police and sheriff departments lower arrest rates and explore lowering inmate populations , more fundamental questions are emerging : Is this how things should have been all along ? Are measures being implemented for the coronavirus era able to endure beyond the outbreak ? And could any of this transformation be permanent ?\nThe coronavirus \u201c has raised awareness that what \u2019 s going on inside matters , and it affects us , \u201d says Michele Deitch , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who specializes in corrections administration .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not another world ; it \u2019 s actually part of our public health system , \u201d she adds . \u201c When we are through this nightmare situation , we may well be willing to make adjustments to our policies that recognize the need to continue some of those new practices . \u201d\nThe decentralized nature of the United States justice system means responses to COVID-19 have varied , as different jurisdictions seek to protect the health of their incarcerated population and the broader community while still fulfilling constitutional duties like the right to a speedy trial .\nLocal , state , and federal courts across the country have closed , from Bexar County , Texas , where justices of the peace have suspended eviction hearings , to the U.S. Supreme Court , which has suspended oral arguments .\nAs of March 20 , some 15 states and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons had suspended all visitation , while 37 states were still allowing legal visits , according to a tracker maintained by The Marshall Project . Corrections administrators and law enforcement , meanwhile , have been taking a three-pronged approach : lowering admissions , speeding up releases , and improving overall hygiene and health screening of inmates and staff .\nLocal jail systems , which saw 10.6 million admissions in 2017 , are a critical front line in the country \u2019 s COVID-19 response .\n\u201c They \u2019 re going to be the first place this starts , \u201d says Professor Deitch . They \u201c need to be turning off the spigot of who \u2019 s coming into the system . \u201d\nIn Los Angeles County , home to the country \u2019 s largest local jail system , that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re trying to do .\nLA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is working the problem from both ends . He \u2019 s released inmates early , freeing those with fewer than 30 days left to serve . Deputies are arresting fewer people \u2013 though still arresting violent suspects . Offenders who would see their bail set at $ 50,000 or less are being given citations , an increase from $ 25,000 .\nThe number of inmates in the jails has decreased by more than 1,000 , and arrests have dropped from an average of 300 a day to 60 .\nLA County Public Defender Ricardo Garc\u00eda is continuing to talk with the sheriff \u2019 s office about more ways to safely reduce the inmate population and the risk of contagion . And on March 24 the Superior Court of Los Angeles ordered the release of an undisclosed number pre-trial inmates from the county jail .\nA significant number of people are being held pretrial , not yet convicted of a crime \u2013 approximately 40 % of the inmate population in 2016 . His greatest concern is an acute outbreak in the jails .\n\u201c We have huge swaths of people in jail who would do fine in the community if steps were taken to help them , \u201d he says .\nSheriff departments in Nashville , Tennessee ; and Cleveland are taking similar actions . More than 200 inmates were released from Cuyahoga County jail in Cleveland earlier this month .\nIn Texas last week , the Fort Worth Police Department stopped making Class C misdemeanor arrests , while in Houston , the Harris County Sheriff \u2019 s Office is seeking compassionate release for some inmates in the county jail , where 540 people were 56 or older as of March 23 .\nThe number of people age 55 or older in state and federal prisons increased by 280 % between 1999 and 2006 . For decades sanitation and health care in prisons have been a low priority , according to Homer Venters , former chief medical officer for New York City Correctional Health Services .\nHealth care behind bars \u201c is poor and inadequate because it has been designed to be that way , \u201d said Dr. Venters on a March 13 conference call organized by The Justice Collaborative .\n\u201c We hear a lot about hand-washing as the most important [ outbreak avoidance ] tool . Most of the jails and prisons I \u2019 ve been to around the country don \u2019 t have enough sinks , \u201d he added . \u201c And if there are enough sinks , there isn \u2019 t enough soap . \u201d\nAnd many prisons , jails , and immigration detention centers are full , if not overcrowded \u2013 an environment that , according to Dr. Venters , makes managing and preventing an outbreak \u201c almost impossible . \u201d\nSome departments have been providing inmates with soap free of charge and waiving fees for inmate health care , but they should be doing more , says Professor Deitch . Prisons should be expanding compassionate release , providing free phone and video calls , ramping up medical checks , and instituting de-escalation measures so public health restrictions within prisons don \u2019 t boil over into violence .\n\u201c Anything we can do to get anyone out of there who doesn \u2019 t absolutely need to be there is smart from a humanitarian perspective , but also to reduce the spread of the virus in the community , \u201d she adds . \u201c What happens in jails and prisons doesn \u2019 t stay in jails and prisons , and when we \u2019 re talking about communicable diseases like this , that \u2019 s especially true . \u201d\nTexas announced on March 24 the first positive case of the coronavirus in a state prison inmate . There were about 9,600 people age 60 or older in Texas prisons in fiscal year 2018 , with just over half of inmates behind bars for violent offenses .\n\u201c There are a lot of people in prison who don \u2019 t need to be there , \u201d says Jennifer Erschabek , executive director of the Texas Inmate Families Association . \u201c But you can \u2019 t just kick them out the door and say , \u2018 See you later . \u2019 \u201d\nStill , for inmates and their families , the thought of a COVID-19 outbreak behind bars is never far from their minds \u2013 and restrictions on visitation , logical as they may be , have not helped .\nFor Jeff Gifford and his wife , visits to their son in the Darrington Unit near Houston have been what they live for . Since they lost visitation on March 13 , their reactions have varied .\n\u201c My first thought was , \u2018 [ Darn ] it , it \u2019 s horrible. \u2019 My second thought was , \u2018 Thank God , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Gifford , a real estate agent in Austin .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a struggle , \u201d he adds . \u201c We \u2019 re just really happy the disease hasn \u2019 t spread inside yet . \u201d\n\u201c You just don \u2019 t know how seriously [ prison staff members ] are taking the edicts set out by management , \u201d he continues . \u201c But you hope for the best ; that \u2019 s all you can do . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re doing every day . \u201d\nSomething else Mr. Gifford , and many others , are hoping for is that , once the coronavirus pandemic has passed , people living and working in prisons and jails aren \u2019 t shunted back to society \u2019 s margins , and that new policies of compassion don \u2019 t disappear with the virus .\n\u201c We all need to be treating each other with more compassion and kindness right now , [ including ] in custodial settings , \u201d says Professor Deitch .\n\u201c If jurisdictions do what I think they need to do \u2013 that \u2019 s reducing the number of people held in their custody , \u201d she adds , \u201c I think we \u2019 re going to learn it \u2019 s possible to do that quickly and safely without putting public safety at risk . \u201d",
