    "content": "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson \u2019 s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain \u2019 s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don \u2019 think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen \u2019 s speech , that \u2019 s what we want to do . More importantly , let \u2019 s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn \u2019 t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . \u2026as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that \u2019 s what we are working on . And I \u2019 ll be honest with you\u2026 it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts . Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we \u2019 ve got to get on and do it . \u2026As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal , and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together , working in the national interest to get this thing done , and that is what we are going to do .\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign , and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations .\nUpdate 1305 : Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament \u201c worst political decision ever \u201d\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson \u2019 s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings \u2014 who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past \u2014 should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered .\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made , Mr Farage said : \u201c We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister ; virtually , that \u2019 s how important the ruling is .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others . \u201d\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government , a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom .
