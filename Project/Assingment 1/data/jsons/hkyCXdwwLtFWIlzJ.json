In the War of 1812 , when Detroit was taken by a remarkably small number of British troops without a shot being fired , Michigan \u2019 s Governor Hull was said to have been panicked into surrender after drinking heavily . Two centuries later , after an almighty 50-year bender , the city surrendered to itself ... the physical decay of Detroit \u2014 the vacant and derelict lots for block after block after block \u2014 is as nothing compared to the decay of the city \u2019 s human capital .
