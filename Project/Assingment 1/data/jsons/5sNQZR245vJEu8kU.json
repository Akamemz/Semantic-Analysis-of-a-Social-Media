    "content": "National Democrats are casting about for ways to affirm their support for Israel while also signaling loyalty to President Obama and his bruised ego . Obama has presided over an unprecedented cold spell in US-Israeli relations , thanks to a toxic combination of his personal dislike of Benjamin Netanyahu ( evidently shared by many within his administration ) and his historically unfriendly posture toward our close ally . Some Senate Democrats sought to offer Netanyahu an opportunity to address their caucus in private , perhaps giving members cover to demonstrate pro-Obama solidarity by skipping the Prime Minister 's controversial address to a joint session of Congress next week . Netanyahu is n't playing along :\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined on Tuesday an invitation to meet with U.S. Senate Democrats during his trip to Washington next week . `` Though I greatly appreciate your kind invitation to meet with Democratic Senators , I believe that doing so at this time could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit , '' Netanyahu wrote in a letter to Senators Richard Durbin and Dianne Feinstein obtained by Reuters . Durbin and Feinstein , two senior Senate Democrats , invited Netanyahu to a closed-door meeting with Democratic senators in a letter on Monday , warning that making U.S.-Israeli relations a partisan political issue could have `` lasting repercussions '' ... In his letter , Netanyahu said he agreed `` wholeheartedly '' that strong ties between the United States and Israel have been built on bipartisan support .... He expressed appreciation for the opportunity to address lawmakers from both parties on Tuesday and said he regretted that the invitation has been perceived by some as partisan . `` I can assure you my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel 's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country , '' Netanyahu wrote .\nAs a liberal Democrat who twice campaigned for President Barack Obama , I am appalled that some Democratic members of Congress are planning to boycott the speech of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 3 to a joint session of Congress . At bottom , this controversy is not mainly about protocol and politics\u2014it is about the constitutional system of checks and balances and the separation of powers . Under the Constitution , the executive and legislative branches share responsibility for making and implementing important foreign-policy decisions . Congress has a critical role to play in scrutinizing the decisions of the president when these decisions involve national security , relationships with allies and the threat of nuclear proliferation . Congress has every right to invite , even over the president \u2019 s strong objection , any world leader or international expert who can assist its members in formulating appropriate responses to the current deal being considered with Iran regarding its nuclear-weapons program . Indeed , it is the responsibility of every member of Congress to listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu , who probably knows more about this issue than any world leader , because it threatens the very existence of the nation state of the Jewish people . Congress has the right to disagree with the prime minister , but the idea that some members of Congress will not give him the courtesy of listening violates protocol and basic decency to a far greater extent than anything Mr. Netanyahu is accused of doing for having accepted an invitation from Congress .\nThe United States and Iran are shaping the contours of a deal that would initially freeze Tehran 's nuclear program but would allow it to slowly ramp up activities that could be used to make nuclear arms over the last years of the agreement 's duration ... The idea would be to reward Iran for good behavior over the last years of any agreement , by gradually lifting constraints on its uranium enrichment program imposed as part of a deal that would also would slowly ease sanctions on the Islamic Republic . Iran says it does not want nuclear arms and needs enrichment only for energy , medical and scientific purposes , but the U.S. fears Tehran could re-engineer the program to its other potential use - producing the fissile core of a nuclear weapon . The U.S. initially sought restrictions lasting for up to 20 years ; Iran had pushed for less than a decade . Iran could be allowed to operate significantly more centrifuges than the U.S. administration first demanded , though at lower capacity than they currently run . Several officials spoke of 6,500 centrifuges as a potential point of compromise . If the sides agree on 15 years , for instance , the strict controls could be in place for 10 years with gradual lifting over five . Possible easing of the controls could see Iran increasing the number of enriching centrifuges back toward the 10,000 or so it now has operating , and increasing the level of enrichment while keeping it well below levels approaching weapons-grade .\nWe 'll return to the rumored Iran deal in a moment , but first , Congressional Democrats must decide whether their loyalties lie with Obama 's partisan sensitivities , or America 's best friend in the Middle East .
