    "content": "His refusal to release his tax returns suggests his net worth is less than the $ 10 billion he claims .\nHe could start a nuclear arms race and equip terrorists with weapons to destroy the United States .\nEven Republicans don \u2019 t want him . He \u2019 s a \u201c loose cannon , \u201d unpredictable and just \u201c too risky \u201d to be president .\nThose are just a few of the opening salvos in the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2019 s initial attempts to define the presumptive Republican nominee .\nIn the early days of the Clinton-Trump showdown , there \u2019 s been no shortage of attack lines , or campaign surrogates eager to deliver them . But a potential obstacle is already emerging , one that 16 Republicans have failed to overcome this year : creating a coherent narrative to define a candidate who seems to blunder from one negative headline to the next with no permanent scars to show for it .\n\u201c Our problem is a target-rich environment , \u201d said one Clinton ally , who noted that every day this week the news cycle was dominated by seemingly damaging headlines about Trump .\n\u201c Right now , they \u2019 re doing a little bit of everything to see what works , \u201d explained President Barack Obama \u2019 s former senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer , noting that the stakes are low because the campaign has yet to put any money behind its attacks .\nBut the central challenge , he said , already has been revealed : maintaining message discipline at the negative headline buffet that is Trump .\n\u201c You can spend all day , every day , going after a hundred different things , and those things can add up to less than one hundred , \u201d Pfeiffer said . \u201c They may not weave into a narrative , or you may not be able to drive any one of them for long enough . You need discipline . \u201d\nFor all his flaws as a candidate , Trump has proved to be incredibly disciplined in branding his rivals . His nickname \u201c Little Marco \u201d skillfully demeaned the presidential qualities of Sen. Marco Rubio . \u201c Low-energy Jeb \u201d planted the idea in Republican primary voters \u2019 minds that Jeb Bush wasn \u2019 t up to the job . And his new focus on \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d plays on one of the Democratic front-runner \u2019 s biggest vulnerabilities as a candidate : trust .\n\u201c He \u2019 s going to hammer \u2018 Crooked Hillary \u2019 the whole time , \u201d Pfeiffer added . \u201c To me , the biggest fear is young people will feel like it doesn \u2019 t really matter . They may not turn out . \u201d\nClinton has been less successful at defining her primary challenger . The underestimated Sanders campaign grew into a nationwide movement before Clinton \u2019 s eyes and drove much of the discourse in the Democratic primary .\nNow , as Clinton seeks to define Trump at an early stage in the general election , her campaign appears to be in a phase of seeing what sticks . Last week , Clinton and her surrogates tried out several disparate lines of attack .\n\u201c What \u2019 s really clear , \u201d Neera Tanden , Clinton \u2019 s former top policy adviser , said on a conference call with reporters , \u201c is Donald Trump has made it entirely clear throughout the entirety of his campaign that he would be a terrible choice for women voters . \u201d\nThat clarion message , however , was not amplified the next day . Instead , the follow-up was a call with Labor Secretary Tom Perez , who urged reporters to \u201c think about what Trump \u2019 s plans mean for Latinos . Middle-class Americans and Latinos would pay the price for his reckless quest to continue enriching the billionaires . \u201d\nClinton herself chose to highlight a third issue while stumping in New Jersey , where she surprised her aides by uncharacteristically engaging with an audience member who yelled out a question about Trump \u2019 s tax returns .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got to ask yourself , \u201d she responded from the stage , \u201c why doesn \u2019 t he want to release them ? Yeah , well , we \u2019 re going to find out . \u201d\nAnd on Monday night , at a speech at the Asia Society in Manhattan , Clinton \u2019 s senior foreign policy adviser , Jake Sullivan , painted a frightening picture of Trump as commander in chief . His comments that more countries should be able to obtain nuclear weapons , Sullivan said , have \u201c the very real risk of sparking a nuclear arms race . \u201d\nClinton campaign officials said the common thread of the attacks so far is that they underscore the idea that Trump is \u201c too risky to be president . \u201d\nBut Clinton allies are not even on the same page yet about that theme .\n\u201c I frankly don \u2019 t think \u2018 risky \u2019 captures it , because \u2018 risk \u2019 implies potential upside , \u201d Priorities USA chief strategist Guy Cecil said Monday while unveiling the PAC \u2019 s first television ads attacking Trump .\nOther Clinton allies said they worry Trump \u2019 s daily distractions will make it difficult for that message to sink in . \u201c I follow closely and couldn \u2019 t tell you what she \u2019 s been talking about , \u201d said one top Democrat with ties to the campaign . \u201c They literally need to consult a psychiatrist about how you unravel a clinical narcissist . \u201d\nClinton surrogate and Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen admitted there has been \u201c some reticence to get the daily Trump assault started . Once it starts , it \u2019 s hard to pull back . I don \u2019 t think anyone has quite settled on the right formula for how much of the Trump pushback is from Hillary , and how much is from surrogates . \u201d\nShe added : \u201c There \u2019 s just so much material and he jumps around on so many issues . Finding the balance between responding to his crazy policy inconsistencies and putting your own anti-Trump message out there is a constant set of choices . There \u2019 s just so much material , it \u2019 s hard to choose . \u201d\nRosen compared the campaign with Bill Clinton \u2019 s 1992 presidential run , when the daily mantra was so simple it was written on the wall at the Little Rock campaign headquarters : \u201c It \u2019 s the economy , stupid . \u201d\nThis time , said Rosen , \u201c The tagline will be , \u2018 Women make the difference . \u2019 \u201d\nIf so , that has not been conveyed yet to Clinton allies who appear on television on behalf of the campaign . \u201c I \u2019 m winging it , \u201d one surrogate said . \u201c They don \u2019 t know yet what narrative they \u2019 re forming against him , and the story needs to be written well before the convention . \u201d\nAnother problem confronting the Clinton campaign is how to stay on offense against a candidate who drives the news cycle simply by calling in to television morning shows , or firing off a provocative tweet .\nOn Tuesday , for example , while campaigning in Puerto Rico , Bill Clinton was asked to respond to Trump \u2019 s tweet calling him the \u201c WORST woman abuser of all time . \u201d\n\u201c No . I won \u2019 t , \u201d he said . \u201c I think people are smart enough to figure this out without my help . \u201d\nHillary Clinton , Democrats said , also needs to make Trump respond to her . \u201c There has to be some tiger team within the Clinton campaign that focuses entirely , all day , every day , on what can we do to make Donald Trump respond to us , \u201d Pfeiffer said . \u201c Is it a video ? Is it something Hillary does herself ? Will Bill Clinton do it ? Your days are so all consuming that if you don \u2019 t dedicate some special team whose job it is , it won \u2019 t happen . \u201d\nHowever , Jeb Bush \u2019 s former communications director and anti-Trump activist , Tim Miller , warned against over-thinking strategy .\n\u201c Hillary has the advantage of being able to fight Trump on turf that benefits her , \u201d said Miller , referring to a general election environment as opposed to a Republican primary . \u201c She can fight him on issues where the electorate is with her . \u201d\nMiller said Bush struggled because \u201c on the big , driving conversations , Trump really had the primary electorate with him .

If I was Hillary, I would really home in on making Trump completely unacceptable to college-educated women, minorities, African-Americans, millennials, and never lose sight of that ball. That is their big advantage in this race.\u201d\n\n",
