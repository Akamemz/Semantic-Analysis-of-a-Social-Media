    "content": "In December 2007 , Venezuela \u2019 s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez suffered his first defeat at the polls . Although still wildly popular among the working class that had propelled him to power nearly a decade earlier , voters rejected a referendum that would have enabled him to run for re-election repeatedly .\nStung , Ch\u00e1vez turned to a close confidant , according to three former advisors : Fidel Castro . The aging Cuban leader had mentored Ch\u00e1vez years before the Venezuelan became president , when he was still best known for leading a failed coup .\nNow , deepening economic ties were making Cuba ever more reliant on oil-rich Venezuela , and Castro was eager to help Ch\u00e1vez stay in power , these advisors say . Castro \u2019 s advice : Ensure absolute control of the military .\nEasier said than done . Venezuela \u2019 s military had a history of uprisings , sometimes leading to coups of the sort that Ch\u00e1vez , when a lieutenant colonel in the army , had staged in 1992 . A decade later , rivals waged a short-lived putsch against Ch\u00e1vez himself . But if Chavez took the right steps , the Cuban instructed , he could hang on as long as Castro himself had , the advisors recalled . Cuba \u2019 s military , with Castro \u2019 s brother at the helm , controlled everything from security to key sectors of the economy .\nWithin months , the countries drew up two agreements , recently reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , that gave Cuba deep access to Venezuela \u2019 s military - and wide latitude to spy on it and revamp it .\nThe agreements , specifics of which are reported here for the first time , led to the imposing of strict surveillance of Venezuelan troops through a Venezuelan intelligence service now known as the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence , or DGCIM . Under Cuban military advisors , Venezuela refashioned the intelligence unit into a service that spies on its own armed forces , instilling fear and paranoia and quashing dissent . Now known for its repressive tactics , the DGCIM is accused by soldiers , opposition lawmakers , human rights groups and many foreign governments of abuses including torture and the recent death of a detained Navy captain .\nAccording to the documents reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the agreements , signed in May 2008 , allowed Cuba \u2019 s armed forces to :\n\u2022 And change the intelligence service \u2019 s mission from spying on foreign rivals to surveilling the country \u2019 s own soldiers , officers , and even senior commanders .\nThe first agreement , according to the documents , would prepare Venezuelan intelligence agents to \u201c discover and confront the subversive work of the enemy. \u201d The second agreement authorized Cuban officials to oversee the \u201c assimilation \u201d and \u201c modernization \u201d of Venezuela \u2019 s military .\nThe presence of Cuban officials within Venezuela \u2019 s military has been known for years . President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro , Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s disciple and increasingly beleaguered successor , said in a 2017 speech : \u201c We are grateful to Cuba \u2019 s revolutionary armed forces . We salute them and will always welcome them . \u201d\nBut neither country has ever acknowledged details of the agreements or the extent of Cuba \u2019 s involvement . In March , after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence denounced Havana \u2019 s \u201c malign influence \u201d on Caracas , Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez downplayed the relationship . \u201c I strongly reject repeated and false accusations , \u201d he tweeted , \u201c of Cuban military \u2018 training , \u2019 \u2018 controlling \u2019 or \u2018 intimidating \u2019 in Venezuela . \u201d\nNeither Venezuela \u2019 s Defense Ministry nor its Information Ministry , responsible for government communications including those of Maduro , responded to emails and phone calls for this article . Cuban officials didn \u2019 t respond to requests from \u2588\u2588\u2588 for comment .\nEleven years after they were forged , the military agreements have proven crucial for Maduro \u2019 s survival as president , according to security experts , people familiar with the administration and opposition politicians . With Cuba \u2019 s help and training , the military has stood by Maduro and helped him weather an economic meltdown , widespread hunger and crime , and the emigration of more than 4 million people \u2013 more than 10 percent of Venezuela \u2019 s population in recent years .\nIn June , \u2588\u2588\u2588 explained how a reshuffling of the armed forces , and proliferation of senior officers , has kept military leadership beholden to Maduro . Now , the documents laying out Venezuela \u2019 s agreements with Cuba \u2013 and interviews with dozens of current and former members of the armed services , government officials and people familiar with the relationship between Caracas and Havana \u2013 show how instrumental Castro \u2019 s help has been as well .\nThe transformation of the DGCIM , these people say , has been particularly effective . \u201c The most important mission for the intelligence service once was to neutralize any threat to democracy , \u201d said Ra\u00fal Salazar , a former defense minister under Ch\u00e1vez who opposes Maduro . \u201c Now , with Cuba in charge , the government uses it to stay in power . \u201d\nOnce Cuba began training DGCIM personnel , the intelligence service embedded agents , often dressed in black fatigues , within barracks . There , they would compile dossiers on perceived troublemakers and report any signs of disloyalty , according to more than 20 former Venezuelan military and intelligence officials . The DGCIM also began tapping the phones of officers , including senior military commanders , to listen for conspiracies .\nThe crackdown has led to hundreds of arrests . At least 200 military officials are currently detained , according to the opposition-led National Assembly . Citizen Control , a Venezuelan organization that studies the armed forces , says the number is over 300 .\nIn a June 2017 report , reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the DGCIM accused a soldier , who enrolled in a university considered to be aligned with the opposition , of \u201c ideological and political subversion. \u201d Speaking out for the first time , the former lieutenant recounted how he was handcuffed to a chair in a continuously lit room and beaten until two vertebrae broke .\n\u201c Those days had no end , \u201d he recalled . He revealed his story to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on the condition that the news agency use only his first name , Daniel , and not disclose his age .\nSince its remaking , the DGCIM \u2019 s ranks have swelled \u2013 from a few hundred agents early in the Ch\u00e1vez administration to at least 1,500 now , according to former military officials . A recent United Nations report accused the DGCIM of torture \u2013 including electric shocks , suffocation , waterboarding , sexual violence , and water and food deprivation . Under Maduro , DGCIM officers have been promoted to senior positions , including the command of his personal security detail .\nThe repression , opposition leaders say , has cowed the armed forces . Juan Guaid\u00f3 , head of the National Assembly , early this year denounced Maduro \u2019 s 2018 re-election as a sham and declared , with the support of most Western democracies , that he was Venezuela \u2019 s rightful leader .\nBut opposition pleas for a military rebellion have gone unheeded . \u201c We have failed , \u201d said a senior opposition official involved in attempts to broker talks with military leaders . \u201c We have nothing to offer to convince them . \u201d\nFor Ch\u00e1vez , the changes foreseen by the two agreements resonated on a personal level .\nCastro , whom he had long admired , was the first international leader to embrace Ch\u00e1vez as a rising politician in the 1990s . Venezuela \u2019 s military intelligence unit , meanwhile , was run by officers allied with the conservative elite and opposed to Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s vision of transforming a country which , despite boasting the world \u2019 s biggest oil reserves , suffered rampant poverty .\nWhen Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s 1992 coup failed , officers from the unit , then known as the Directorate of Military Intelligence , or DIM , were the ones tasked with arresting him . They initially jailed him in one of the same underground cells at the DIM \u2019 s Caracas headquarters where Ch\u00e1vez would later detain some of his own political opponents , according to several former officials .\nMonths after his release from prison because of a presidential pardon , Ch\u00e1vez in 1994 flew to Havana , where Castro , in their first in-person meeting , greeted him at the airport . In Ch\u00e1vez , Castro saw a like-minded leftist leader of the sort that had become rare since the end of the Cold War . In Venezuela \u2019 s vast oil wealth , Castro saw potential nourishment for a Cuban economy starved by the collapse of its former sponsor , the Soviet Union .\nWith Castro looking on , Ch\u00e1vez in a speech at the University of Havana called Cuba , then in its fourth decade of authoritarian rule , \u201c a bastion of Latin American dignity. \u201d He vowed to cure the capitalist \u201c gangrene \u201d afflicting Venezuela .\nAfter the visit , the two men began to speak regularly , former advisors said .\nBy the late 1990s , high inflation , low economic growth and increased poverty made Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s Socialist message attractive to a growing number of Venezuelans . In 1998 , he was elected president . Almost immediately , he deepened formal links with Cuba .\nIn October 2000 , Castro travelled to Caracas to sign a series of economic agreements . Venezuela would give Cuba enough oil to meet half its energy needs . Since then , Venezuela has sent at least 55,000 barrels per day to the island , or more than $ 21 billion worth of oil , according to government figures and average prices over the period . In exchange , Cuba sent thousands of doctors , teachers and agricultural specialists to help diversify Venezuela \u2019 s grass-roots economy .\nBy 2002 , many of Venezuela \u2019 s elite had tired of Ch\u00e1vez . That April , conservative opposition leaders teamed up with military chieftains , including senior DIM officials , and detained him . But the coup , after a massive popular uprising on his behalf , failed within two days .\nBack in power , and with Castro \u2019 s blessing , Ch\u00e1vez placed Cuban advisors within his inner circle to tighten security , according to his former advisors and several former military officials . He began a purge of the intelligence service and other top ranks of the military . He appointed Hugo Carvajal , a lieutenant colonel who had joined Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s 1992 coup effort and later headed the DIM \u2019 s investigations division , to be its subdirector . Within two years , Carvajal became its director general .\nCarvajal began modernizing the DIM . In an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Carvajal said Venezuela \u2019 s central bank provided millions of U.S. dollars in cash to the DIM for new technology , including surveillance equipment and a database to centralize intelligence .\nThe intelligence boss would lead the service for nearly a decade . Now out of office , he has been sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department for allegedly helping Colombian guerrillas . Last April he was arrested in Spain and remains detained in response to a U.S. warrant for alleged drug trafficking . In the email , sent through his lawyer in Spain , Carvajal denied the accusations .\nIn July 2007 , Ch\u00e1vez named Gustavo Rangel , a loyalist who headed the army reserves , as defense minister .\nAt his swearing-in , Rangel spoke of the need for \u201c new Venezuelan military thinking \u201d to counter the \u201c real enemy. \u201d The \u201c empire , \u201d he said , using common Caracas shorthand for the United States , was sponsoring \u201c subversive groups \u201d bent on destroying the revolution .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 was unable to reach Rangel , now retired , for comment .\nThat December , Ch\u00e1vez lost the referendum on term limits . On television , he vowed a \u201c new offensive \u201d to pursue the goal .\nDefense talks with Cuba began . At a meeting in Caracas on May 26 , 2008 , Rangel and General \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez , Cuba \u2019 s vice minister of defense , signed the two agreements .\nUnder the first agreement , Cuba \u2019 s defense ministry would oversee a restructuring of the DIM and advise on creating \u201c new units \u201d inside the service . The DIM would also send groups of as many as 40 officers to Havana for up to three months of espionage training .\nAccording to the documents , Venezuela would send resumes of training candidates for Cuba to vet . Courses included how to handle \u201c secret collaborators , \u201d how to conduct criminal investigations and how to select new intelligence agents .\nMost of the training , according to the documents , took place at the Comandante Arides Est\u00e9vez S\u00e1nchez Military Academy in western Havana . At the academy , a cluster of white four-story buildings and parade grounds , Cuban instructors told DIM agents their mission henceforth would be to infiltrate and control the military , according to five people familiar with the courses .\nThe second agreement created a committee known as the Coordination and Liaison Group of the Republic of Cuba , or GRUCE . The GRUCE , comprising eight Cuban \u201c military experts , \u201d would send Cuban advisors to Venezuela to inspect military units and train soldiers .\nOne former Venezuelan intelligence official recalled training he received by Cuban instructors on a farm in the eastern Venezuelan state of Anzo\u00e1tegui . Instructors , he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , drilled students with questions about their political beliefs . The DIM , they said , must be the \u201c tip of the spear \u201d in the fight against \u201c traitors . \u201d\nCh\u00e1vez , fortified by increases in government spending that boosted his popularity , won a new referendum to end term limits .\nIn 2011 , he changed the DIM \u2019 s name to include the term \u201c counterintelligence , \u201d reflecting its mission to thwart sabotage from within . By then , the new DGCIM was several hundred agents stronger , former officials said .\nFresh from Cuban training , the new agents began infiltrating barracks . \u201c We lived and trained with the troops to monitor them , keeping the bosses informed , \u201d another former DGCIM officer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We had an iron grip . \u201d\nSome agents pretended to be regular soldiers . Others donned their DGCIM uniforms and regularly encouraged soldiers to report on each other . They came to be known as \u201c the men in black , \u201d according to several former soldiers .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll hand you to the DGCIM , \u201d a battalion commander warned would-be rebels , one soldier recalled . Stories of detentions and torture by DGCIM agents , sometimes wearing skeleton masks and balaclavas , spread through the ranks .\nCh\u00e1vez , following four surgeries in Cuba , died in 2013 . Castro in a newspaper column called him \u201c the best friend the Cuban people had in their history. \u201d Voters elected Maduro to succeeded him .\nIn 2014 , oil prices plummeted . Maduro \u2019 s effort to spur the economy failed .\nHunger and shortages hit even the armed forces . A military doctor told \u2588\u2588\u2588 recently that many enlisted soldiers are underweight , subsisting primarily on pasta and lentils .\nAs growing numbers of troops sought to desert , the DGCIM grew more aggressive . It expanded surveillance , wiretapping senior officers .\nOn the top floor of its headquarters , some 40 agents in its Operational Communications Division used a platform called Genesi , according to a former member of the team . The system , designed by Italian telecommunications firm IPS SpA , allows users to \u201c intercept , monitor and analyze every kind of information source , \u201d according to the company \u2019 s web site .\nIPS didn \u2019 t respond to calls , emails or a letter seeking comment at its Rome headquarters . \u2588\u2588\u2588 couldn \u2019 t identify an IPS office or personnel working in Venezuela .\nIn July 2017 , Daniel , the Army lieutenant in Caracas , was summoned to his battalion commander \u2019 s office . Once a Ch\u00e1vez supporter , Daniel had joined the army in 2004 but under Maduro lost enthusiasm and told superiors he planned to leave . He had enrolled in law classes at a local university while still in the military and taken part in some opposition marches .\nDaniel \u2019 s behavior , according to the intelligence report reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , was \u201c counter-revolutionary. \u201d The report described the university , whose name Daniel asked \u2588\u2588\u2588 not to disclose , as a school for the opposition .\nUpon reporting to the commander \u2019 s office , Daniel said , three uniformed counterintelligence agents confiscated his phone and said he was needed for an \u201c interview \u201d at DGCIM headquarters . Daniel said agents transferred him to an underground cell and handcuffed him to a chair . Each day , a man entered and punched him repeatedly . The beatings broke two vertebrae , according to a physician \u2019 s report reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The cell was lit all hours , causing Daniel to lose track of time .\n\u201c We are grateful to Cuba \u2019 s revolutionary armed forces . We salute them and will always welcome them . \u201d\nAfter 20 days , a military court charged him with treason , rebellion and violating military decorum . Pending a trial , he was transferred to another prison . Six months later , after entering a guilty plea , the court released Daniel on condition he remain in the country . He was expelled from the Army .\nDaniel returned to law classes , but regrets pleading guilty . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure it was the right thing to do , \u201d he said , but noted that many who don \u2019 t enter a plea remain detained indefinitely . \u201c You can \u2019 t fight the state . \u201d\nThe surveillance has hurt even senior officers . One case sparked national outrage , forcing the government to recognize DGCIM abuse . Rafael Acosta , a 50-year-old Navy captain , died in DGCIM custody on June 29 , eight days after agents arrested him .\nTarek Saab , Venezuela \u2019 s chief prosecutor , said Acosta was detained for participating in an unspecified \u201c right wing \u201d plot . Acosta \u2019 s wife , Waleswka P\u00e9rez , said the accusations were untrue and accused the DGCIM of torture .\nOn July 1 , Saab said the government had charged two DGCIM agents with homicide . He gave neither a cause of death nor the circumstances in which it occurred . The charges , Saab said in a statement , followed an \u201c impartial \u201d investigation into the \u201c unfortunate event . \u201d\nIn March 2018 , five DGCIM agents summoned Lieutenant Colonel Igbert Mar\u00edn , commander of the 302nd mechanized Army brigade , in Caracas . Mar\u00edn , now 40 and the father of two young children , for most of his career was a rising star who had excelled at Venezuela \u2019 s top military academy .\nHis wife , Yoselyn Carrizales , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the agents took Mar\u00edn to the Defense Ministry , where he was met by officials including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Iv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez , the current head of the DGCIM .\nThe officials accused Mar\u00edn of scheming against the government , said Carrizales , who is acting as one of Mar\u00edn \u2019 s attorneys . They said they had video evidence of Mar\u00edn and eight other officers conspiring , she added , but didn \u2019 t show him the video .\nMar\u00edn denied the allegation , saying that the meeting in question had been merely a gathering of old academy classmates . Indignant , he told the defense minister that such accusations were counterproductive , especially at a time when most of the military was suffering from shortages of food , pay and equipment .\nThe minister should \u201c leave his office , open his eyes and see how soldiers actually feel , \u201d Mar\u00edn told Padrino , according to Carrizales . Another lawyer defending Mar\u00edn , Alonso Medina Roa , confirmed her account .\nThe agents took Mar\u00edn and the eight other officers to DGCIM headquarters . Mar\u00edn later told his attorneys that agents handcuffed him to a chair , placed a bag over his head and filled it with tear gas . His lawyers detailed the alleged abuse to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nA week later , at a hearing Carrizales attended , a military court charged Mar\u00edn with treason , instigating rebellion and violating decorum . Agents then took Mar\u00edn away . He remained incommunicado for 78 days .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t know if he was alive or dead , \u201d said Carrizales . Mar\u00edn remains detained , and his wife continues to work for his release . Venezuelan officials haven \u2019 t publicly commented on the case or shown Mar\u00edn \u2019 s lawyers the alleged video . No trial date has been set .\n\u201c They fear him , \u201d Carrizales said . \u201c He is an obvious leader within the armed forces . That \u2019 s why they arrested him . \u201d\nAdditional reporting by Deisy Buitrago in Caracas ; Tibisay Romero in Valencia , Venezuela ; Julia Symmes Cobb in Bogot\u00e1 ; Marianna Parraga in M\u00e9xico City ; and Angelo Amante in Rome .\nThe Cuba Connection By Angus Berwick Design and photo editing : Pete Hausler Edited by Paulo Prada",

Although still wildly popular among the working class that had propelled him to power nearly a decade earlier, voters rejected a referendum that would have enabled him to run for re-election repeatedly.\n\nStung, Ch\u00e1vez turned to a close confidant, according to three former advisors: Fidel Castro.

A decade later, rivals waged a short-lived putsch against Ch\u00e1vez himself. But if Chavez took the right steps, the Cuban instructed, he could hang on as long as Castro himself had, the advisors recalled. Cuba\u2019s military, with Castro\u2019s brother at the helm, controlled everything from security to key sectors of the economy.\n\nWithin months, the countries drew up two agreements, recently reviewed by Reuters, that gave Cuba deep access to Venezuela\u2019s military - and wide latitude to spy on it and revamp it.\n\nThe agreements, specifics of which are reported here for the first time, led to the imposing of strict surveillance of Venezuelan troops through a Venezuelan intelligence service now known as the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence, or DGCIM. Under Cuban military advisors, Venezuela refashioned the intelligence unit into a service that spies on its own armed forces, instilling fear and paranoia and quashing dissent. Now known for its repressive tactics, the DGCIM is accused by soldiers, opposition lawmakers, human rights groups and many foreign governments of abuses including torture and the recent death of a detained Navy captain.\n\nAccording to the documents reviewed by Reuters, the agreements, signed in May 2008, allowed Cuba\u2019s armed forces to:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Train soldiers in Venezuela\n\n\u2022 Review and restructure parts of the Venezuelan military\n\n\u2022 Train Venezuelan intelligence agents in Havana\n\n\u2022 And change the intelligence service\u2019s mission from spying on foreign rivals to surveilling the country\u2019s own soldiers, officers, and even senior commanders.\n\nThe first agreement, according to the documents, would prepare Venezuelan intelligence agents to \u201cdiscover and confront the subversive work of the enemy.\u201d The second agreement authorized Cuban officials to oversee the \u201cassimilation\u201d and \u201cmodernization\u201d of Venezuela\u2019s military.\n\nThe presence of Cuban officials within Venezuela\u2019s military has been known for years. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s disciple and increasingly beleaguered successor, said in a 2017 speech: \u201cWe are grateful to Cuba\u2019s revolutionary armed forces. We salute them and will always welcome them.\u201d\n\nBut neither country has ever acknowledged details of the agreements or the extent of Cuba\u2019s involvement. In March, after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence denounced Havana\u2019s \u201cmalign influence\u201d on Caracas, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez downplayed the relationship. \u201cI strongly reject repeated and false accusations,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cof Cuban military \u2018training,\u2019 \u2018controlling\u2019 or \u2018intimidating\u2019 in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nNeither Venezuela\u2019s Defense Ministry nor its Information Ministry, responsible for government communications including those of Maduro, responded to emails and phone calls for this article. Cuban officials didn\u2019t respond to requests from Reuters for comment.\n\nEleven years after they were forged, the military agreements have proven crucial for Maduro\u2019s survival as president, according to security experts, people familiar with the administration and opposition politicians. With Cuba\u2019s help and training, the military has stood by Maduro and helped him weather an economic meltdown, widespread hunger and crime, and the emigration of more than 4 million people \u2013 more than 10 percent of Venezuela\u2019s population in recent years.\n\nIn June, Reuters explained how a reshuffling of the armed forces, and proliferation of senior officers, has kept military leadership beholden to Maduro. Now, the documents laying out Venezuela\u2019s agreements with Cuba \u2013 and interviews with dozens of current and former members of the armed services, government officials and people familiar with the relationship between Caracas and Havana \u2013 show how instrumental Castro\u2019s help has been as well.\n\nThe transformation of the DGCIM, these people say, has been particularly effective. \u201cThe most important mission for the intelligence service once was to neutralize any threat to democracy,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Salazar, a former defense minister under Ch\u00e1vez who opposes Maduro. \u201cNow, with Cuba in charge, the government uses it to stay in power.\u201d\n\nOnce Cuba began training DGCIM personnel, the intelligence service embedded agents, often dressed in black fatigues, within barracks. There, they would compile dossiers on perceived troublemakers and report any signs of disloyalty, according to more than 20 former Venezuelan military and intelligence officials. The DGCIM also began tapping the phones of officers, including senior military commanders, to listen for conspiracies.\n\nThe crackdown has led to hundreds of arrests. At least 200 military officials are currently detained, according to the opposition-led National Assembly. Citizen Control, a Venezuelan organization that studies the armed forces, says the number is over 300.\n\nIn a June 2017 report, reviewed by Reuters, the DGCIM accused a soldier, who enrolled in a university considered to be aligned with the opposition, of \u201cideological and political subversion.\u201d Speaking out for the first time, the former lieutenant recounted how he was handcuffed to a chair in a continuously lit room and beaten until two vertebrae broke.\n\n\u201cThose days had no end,\u201d he recalled. He revealed his story to Reuters on the condition that the news agency use only his first name, Daniel, and not disclose his age.\n\nSince its remaking, the DGCIM\u2019s ranks have swelled \u2013 from a few hundred agents early in the Ch\u00e1vez administration to at least 1,500 now, according to former military officials. A recent United Nations report accused the DGCIM of torture \u2013 including electric shocks, suffocation, waterboarding, sexual violence, and water and food deprivation. Under Maduro, DGCIM officers have been promoted to senior positions, including the command of his personal security detail.\n\nThe repression, opposition leaders say, has cowed the armed forces. Juan Guaid\u00f3, head of the National Assembly, early this year denounced Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election as a sham and declared, with the support of most Western democracies, that he was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nBut opposition pleas for a military rebellion have gone unheeded. \u201cWe have failed,\u201d said a senior opposition official involved in attempts to broker talks with military leaders. \u201cWe have nothing to offer to convince them.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bastion of Latin American dignity\u201d\n\nFor Ch\u00e1vez, the changes foreseen by the two agreements resonated on a personal level.\n\nCastro, whom he had long admired, was the first international leader to embrace Ch\u00e1vez as a rising politician in the 1990s. Venezuela\u2019s military intelligence unit, meanwhile, was run by officers allied with the conservative elite and opposed to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s vision of transforming a country which, despite boasting the world\u2019s biggest oil reserves, suffered rampant poverty.\n\nWhen Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1992 coup failed, officers from the unit, then known as the Directorate of Military Intelligence, or DIM, were the ones tasked with arresting him. They initially jailed him in one of the same underground cells at the DIM\u2019s Caracas headquarters where Ch\u00e1vez would later detain some of his own political opponents, according to several former officials.\n\nMonths after his release from prison because of a presidential pardon, Ch\u00e1vez in 1994 flew to Havana, where Castro, in their first in-person meeting, greeted him at the airport. In Ch\u00e1vez, Castro saw a like-minded leftist leader of the sort that had become rare since the end of the Cold War. In Venezuela\u2019s vast oil wealth, Castro saw potential nourishment for a Cuban economy starved by the collapse of its former sponsor, the Soviet Union.\n\nWith Castro looking on, Ch\u00e1vez in a speech at the University of Havana called Cuba, then in its fourth decade of authoritarian rule, \u201ca bastion of Latin American dignity.\u201d He vowed to cure the capitalist \u201cgangrene\u201d afflicting Venezuela.\n\nAfter the visit, the two men began to speak regularly, former advisors said.\n\nBy the late 1990s, high inflation, low economic growth and increased poverty made Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Socialist message attractive to a growing number of Venezuelans. In 1998, he was elected president. Almost immediately, he deepened formal links with Cuba.\n\nIn October 2000, Castro travelled to Caracas to sign a series of economic agreements. Venezuela would give Cuba enough oil to meet half its energy needs. Since then, Venezuela has sent at least 55,000 barrels per day to the island, or more than $21 billion worth of oil, according to government figures and average prices over the period. In exchange, Cuba sent thousands of doctors, teachers and agricultural specialists to help diversify Venezuela\u2019s grass-roots economy.\n\nBy 2002, many of Venezuela\u2019s elite had tired of Ch\u00e1vez. That April, conservative opposition leaders teamed up with military chieftains, including senior DIM officials, and detained him. But the coup, after a massive popular uprising on his behalf, failed within two days.\n\nBack in power, and with Castro\u2019s blessing, Ch\u00e1vez placed Cuban advisors within his inner circle to tighten security, according to his former advisors and several former military officials. He began a purge of the intelligence service and other top ranks of the military. He appointed Hugo Carvajal, a lieutenant colonel who had joined Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1992 coup effort and later headed the DIM\u2019s investigations division, to be its subdirector. Within two years, Carvajal became its director general.\n\nCarvajal began modernizing the DIM. In an email to Reuters, Carvajal said Venezuela\u2019s central bank provided millions of U.S. dollars in cash to the DIM for new technology, including surveillance equipment and a database to centralize intelligence.\n\nThe intelligence boss would lead the service for nearly a decade. Now out of office, he has been sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department for allegedly helping Colombian guerrillas. Last April he was arrested in Spain and remains detained in response to a U.S. warrant for alleged drug trafficking. In the email, sent through his lawyer in Spain, Carvajal denied the accusations.\n\nIn July 2007, Ch\u00e1vez named Gustavo Rangel, a loyalist who headed the army reserves, as defense minister.\n\nAt his swearing-in, Rangel spoke of the need for \u201cnew Venezuelan military thinking\u201d to counter the \u201creal enemy.\u201d The \u201cempire,\u201d he said, using common Caracas shorthand for the United States, was sponsoring \u201csubversive groups\u201d bent on destroying the revolution.\n\nReuters was unable to reach Rangel, now retired, for comment.\n\nThat December, Ch\u00e1vez lost the referendum on term limits. On television, he vowed a \u201cnew offensive\u201d to pursue the goal.\n\nDefense talks with Cuba began. At a meeting in Caracas on May 26, 2008, Rangel and General \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez, Cuba\u2019s vice minister of defense, signed the two agreements.\n\nUnder the first agreement, Cuba\u2019s defense ministry would oversee a restructuring of the DIM and advise on creating \u201cnew units\u201d inside the service. The DIM would also send groups of as many as 40 officers to Havana for up to three months of espionage training.\n\nAccording to the documents, Venezuela would send resumes of training candidates for Cuba to vet. Courses included how to handle \u201csecret collaborators,\u201d how to conduct criminal investigations and how to select new intelligence agents.\n\nMost of the training, according to the documents, took place at the Comandante Arides Est\u00e9vez S\u00e1nchez Military Academy in western Havana. At the academy, a cluster of white four-story buildings and parade grounds, Cuban instructors told DIM agents their mission henceforth would be to infiltrate and control the military, according to five people familiar with the courses.\n\nThe second agreement created a committee known as the Coordination and Liaison Group of the Republic of Cuba, or GRUCE. The GRUCE, comprising eight Cuban \u201cmilitary experts,\u201d would send Cuban advisors to Venezuela to inspect military units and train soldiers.\n\nOne former Venezuelan intelligence official recalled training he received by Cuban instructors on a farm in the eastern Venezuelan state of Anzo\u00e1tegui. Instructors, he told Reuters, drilled students with questions about their political beliefs. The DIM, they said, must be the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d in the fight against \u201ctraitors.\u201d\n\nCh\u00e1vez, fortified by increases in government spending that boosted his popularity, won a new referendum to end term limits.\n\nIn 2011, he changed the DIM\u2019s name to include the term \u201ccounterintelligence,\u201d reflecting its mission to thwart sabotage from within. By then, the new DGCIM was several hundred agents stronger, former officials said.\n\nFresh from Cuban training, the new agents began infiltrating barracks. \u201cWe lived and trained with the troops to monitor them, keeping the bosses informed,\u201d another former DGCIM officer told Reuters. \u201cWe had an iron grip.\u201d\n\nSome agents pretended to be regular soldiers. Others donned their DGCIM uniforms and regularly encouraged soldiers to report on each other. They came to be known as \u201cthe men in black,\u201d according to several former soldiers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hand you to the DGCIM,\u201d a battalion commander warned would-be rebels, one soldier recalled. Stories of detentions and torture by DGCIM agents, sometimes wearing skeleton masks and balaclavas, spread through the ranks.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fight the state\u201d\n\nCh\u00e1vez, following four surgeries in Cuba, died in 2013. Castro in a newspaper column called him \u201cthe best friend the Cuban people had in their history.\u201d Voters elected Maduro to succeeded him.\n\nIn 2014, oil prices plummeted. Maduro\u2019s effort to spur the economy failed.\n\nHunger and shortages hit even the armed forces. A military doctor told Reuters recently that many enlisted soldiers are underweight, subsisting primarily on pasta and lentils.\n\nAs growing numbers of troops sought to desert, the DGCIM grew more aggressive. It expanded surveillance, wiretapping senior officers.\n\nOn the top floor of its headquarters, some 40 agents in its Operational Communications Division used a platform called Genesi, according to a former member of the team. The system, designed by Italian telecommunications firm IPS SpA, allows users to \u201cintercept, monitor and analyze every kind of information source,\u201d according to the company\u2019s web site.\n\nIPS didn\u2019t respond to calls, emails or a letter seeking comment at its Rome headquarters. Reuters couldn\u2019t identify an IPS office or personnel working in Venezuela.\n\nIn July 2017, Daniel, the Army lieutenant in Caracas, was summoned to his battalion commander\u2019s office. Once a Ch\u00e1vez supporter, Daniel had joined the army in 2004 but under Maduro lost enthusiasm and told superiors he planned to leave. He had enrolled in law classes at a local university while still in the military and taken part in some opposition marches.\n\nDaniel\u2019s behavior, according to the intelligence report reviewed by Reuters, was \u201ccounter-revolutionary.\u201d The report described the university, whose name Daniel asked Reuters not to disclose, as a school for the opposition.\n\nUpon reporting to the commander\u2019s office, Daniel said, three uniformed counterintelligence agents confiscated his phone and said he was needed for an \u201cinterview\u201d at DGCIM headquarters. Daniel said agents transferred him to an underground cell and handcuffed him to a chair. Each day, a man entered and punched him repeatedly. The beatings broke two vertebrae, according to a physician\u2019s report reviewed by Reuters. The cell was lit all hours, causing Daniel to lose track of time.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to Cuba\u2019s revolutionary armed forces. We salute them and will always welcome them.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 days, a military court charged him with treason, rebellion and violating military decorum. Pending a trial, he was transferred to another prison. Six months later, after entering a guilty plea, the court released Daniel on condition he remain in the country. He was expelled from the Army.\n\nDaniel returned to law classes, but regrets pleading guilty. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it was the right thing to do,\u201d he said, but noted that many who don\u2019t enter a plea remain detained indefinitely. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight the state.\u201d\n\nThe surveillance has hurt even senior officers. One case sparked national outrage, forcing the government to recognize DGCIM abuse. Rafael Acosta, a 50-year-old Navy captain, died in DGCIM custody on June 29, eight days after agents arrested him.\n\nTarek Saab, Venezuela\u2019s chief prosecutor, said Acosta was detained for participating in an unspecified \u201cright wing\u201d plot. Acosta\u2019s wife, Waleswka P\u00e9rez, said the accusations were untrue and accused the DGCIM of torture.\n\nOn July 1, Saab said the government had charged two DGCIM agents with homicide. He gave neither a cause of death nor the circumstances in which it occurred. The charges, Saab said in a statement, followed an \u201cimpartial\u201d investigation into the \u201cunfortunate event.\u201d\n\nMost DGCIM handiwork never comes to light.\n\nIn March 2018, five DGCIM agents summoned Lieutenant Colonel Igbert Mar\u00edn, commander of the 302nd mechanized Army brigade, in Caracas. Mar\u00edn, now 40 and the father of two young children, for most of his career was a rising star who had excelled at Venezuela\u2019s top military academy.\n\nHis wife, Yoselyn Carrizales, told Reuters the agents took Mar\u00edn to the Defense Ministry, where he was met by officials including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Iv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez, the current head of the DGCIM.\n\nThe officials accused Mar\u00edn of scheming against the government, said Carrizales, who is acting as one of Mar\u00edn\u2019s attorneys. They said they had video evidence of Mar\u00edn and eight other officers conspiring, she added, but didn\u2019t show him the video.\n\nMar\u00edn denied the allegation, saying that the meeting in question had been merely a gathering of old academy classmates. Indignant, he told the defense minister that such accusations were counterproductive, especially at a time when most of the military was suffering from shortages of food, pay and equipment.\n\nThe minister should \u201cleave his office, open his eyes and see how soldiers actually feel,\u201d Mar\u00edn told Padrino, according to Carrizales. Another lawyer defending Mar\u00edn, Alonso Medina Roa, confirmed her account.\n\nNeither Padrino nor Hern\u00e1ndez could be reached for comment.\n\nThe agents took Mar\u00edn and the eight other officers to DGCIM headquarters. Mar\u00edn later told his attorneys that agents handcuffed him to a chair, placed a bag over his head and filled it with tear gas. His lawyers detailed the alleged abuse to Reuters.\n\nA week later, at a hearing Carrizales attended, a military court charged Mar\u00edn with treason, instigating rebellion and violating decorum. Agents then took Mar\u00edn away. He remained incommunicado for 78 days.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was alive or dead,\u201d said Carrizales. Mar\u00edn remains detained, and his wife continues to work for his release. Venezuelan officials haven\u2019t publicly commented on the case or shown Mar\u00edn\u2019s lawyers the alleged video. No trial date has been set.\n\n\u201cThey fear him,\u201d Carrizales said. \u201cHe is an obvious leader within the armed forces. That\u2019s why they arrested him.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Deisy Buitrago in Caracas; Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Venezuela; Julia Symmes Cobb in Bogot\u00e1; Marianna Parraga in M\u00e9xico City; and Angelo Amante in Rome.\n\nThe Cuba Connection By Angus Berwick Design and photo editing: Pete Hausler Edited by Paulo Prada",
