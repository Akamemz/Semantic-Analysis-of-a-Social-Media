( Gretchen Ertl/Reuters )\nThe Democratic Party is quibbling over rhetoric and ignoring the real debate .\nIn recent weeks , several Democratic presidential contenders have been asked whether or not there is room in their party for pro-life Democrats .

In 2012 , the party removed the word \u201c rare \u201d from its platform with regard to abortion , replacing it with a sentence indicating that it now favored \u201c safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay. \u201d During the 2016 campaign , the party platform called for the repeal of the Hyde amendment , which has been added to spending bills on a bipartisan basis since 1976 to prohibit federal funds from directly underwriting or reimbursing abortion procedures .\nThese rhetorical shifts have been mirrored by changes in the policies that Democratic politicians support .
