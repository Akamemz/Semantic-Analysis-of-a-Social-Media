'' The Stafford Act gives access to the funds and the national emergency gives access to authorities , according to a person familiar .\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden , Trump said the action would `` unleash the full power of the federal government .

That includes waivers of some federal licensing requirements , waivers to critical access limits on numbers of beds and lengths of stays , and waivers to rules to bring additional physicians on board at certain hospitals .\nWhen activated , FEMA might also help with logistics , like the transport of residents if needed , and put up temporary medical facilities . Those resources could come from across federal agencies , from stocked warehouses and through contracts .

But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way , but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration , '' he said .\nRequests are generally made by the governor of an affected state . States have been scrambling to sort out what they need to respond to the increasing number of coronavirus cases before they make that request .
