    "content": "Democrats need to talk about Hunter Biden . Sorry , but they do .\nThe fourth Democratic presidential primary debate opened by asking all 12 participants about impeachment . Once the round-robin was finished , CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper turned to Joe Biden and asked this carefully phrased question :\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump \u2019 s attempts to get political dirt on Vice President Biden and his son . President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine . I want to point out there \u2019 s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you . Having said that , on Sunday , you announced if you are president , no one in your family will be involved in any foreign businesses . My question is , if it \u2019 s not okay for a president \u2019 s family to be involved in foreign businesses , why was it okay for your son when you were vice president ?\n\u201c My son did nothing wrong , \u201d Biden replied . \u201c I did nothing wrong . I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine . That \u2019 s what we should be focusing on . \u201d\nChastened , the moderators moved on to ask Elizabeth Warren about whether she \u2019 d raise taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all . But even that , apparently , had been too much . A few minutes later , asked his views on a federal job guarantee , Sen. Cory Booker denounced the moderators for subjecting Biden to such humiliating scrutiny . \u201c I saw this play in 2016 \u2019 s election , \u201d he said . \u201c We are ... elevating a lie and attacking a statesman . That was so offensive . The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump . \u201d\nA few things are true about the Hunter Biden story . One is that there \u2019 s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing : pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation .\nBut another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign , and if Democrats pretend otherwise , they \u2019 re making a mistake .\nMany Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden . Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son ? But no one said politics was fair . And if Democrats avoid the issue , they can be certain Trump will not . Biden \u2019 s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary , when Democrats have other choices , rather than in the general , when they won \u2019 t .\nHunter Biden isn \u2019 t a natural gas expert , and he \u2019 s not a Ukraine expert . But he was son of the then vice president of the United States . And that \u2019 s why he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on Burisma \u2019 s board \u2014 among others . The New Yorker \u2019 s investigation , which predates the revelation of Trump \u2019 s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky , put it well :\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter \u2019 s role at Burisma had no effect on his father \u2019 s policies in Ukraine , but said that , nevertheless , Hunter should not have taken the board seat . As the former senior White House aide put it , there was a perception that \u201c Hunter was on the loose , potentially undermining his father \u2019 s message. \u201d The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted \u201c to be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden. \u201d A former business associate said , \u201c The appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough , at this level of politics , to keep you from doing things like that . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t illegal for Hunter Biden to take that job . But Hunter Biden himself has admitted it was \u201c poor judgment. \u201d It \u2019 s reminiscent of nothing so much as the $ 675,000 Hillary Clinton took for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs : not illegal , but a kind of soft corruption that voters find loathsome .\nClinton and Biden both make the same argument : The money \u2014 in Clinton \u2019 s case direct , in Biden \u2019 s case to his son \u2014 didn \u2019 t affect their decisions . I believe Biden on this . But these are huge sums and represent a kind of DC back-scratching and influence-trading that voters dislike . Getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for doing basically no work is a rare gift , and the cost of accepting that gift or of letting a family member accept it is it can be used against you in a future election .\nNone of this is news to Biden . As the Intercept \u2019 s Ryan Grim documented , Biden has faced attacks for decades over not just Hunter \u2019 s work , but his brother James \u2019 s efforts to cash in on his name , so he knew this was a vulnerability long before Burisma . Biden \u2019 s answer here seems to have been to create a personal firewall about the topics he \u2019 d discuss with Hunter . \u201c I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine , \u201d he said . \u201c No one has indicated I have . We kept everything separate . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s unusual about this case is Hunter Biden appears to have inadvertently done his country a great service : He lured Donald Trump into openly extorting a foreign country to investigate the son of a domestic political rival . It \u2019 s an important revelation that has launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and may help Democrats win back the White House . But is Joe Biden going to be the strongest Democratic contender in this conversation ? Or will his ability to make the case be compromised , as every time he attacks Trump for soliciting foreign assistance , Trump will counter with allegations about why exactly Hunter Biden was being paid so much money by a Ukrainian natural gas giant ?\nHere is a list of people who have criticized Hunter Biden of Nepotism in the last 24 hours :\nHunter Biden \u2019 s exploits also make it hard for Biden to launch what should be a broader , and damning , attack on Trump : that he \u2019 s compromised and corrupted the government through nepotism and self-dealing .

The result was that rather than Democrats realizing how damaging that story was \u2014 and how ineffective Clinton was at putting it to rest \u2014 during the primary , they found that out in the general election . And yes , the media deserves the blame for the coverage decisions , but Democrats can \u2019 t simply assume the media won \u2019 t make the same mistakes in 2020 . The lesson of Clinton \u2019 s emails is that unfair smears can help Donald Trump get elected .\nI \u2019 m not arguing that any of this disqualifies Joe Biden .
