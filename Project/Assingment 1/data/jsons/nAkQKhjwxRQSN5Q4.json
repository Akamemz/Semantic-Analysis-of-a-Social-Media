    "content": "The tenure system in American higher education is a limitless source of debate : Critics say it leaves younger scholars to publish or perish , or decaying professors to cash in on mediocrity ; advocates note its importance in protecting academic freedom , risk-taking and , insofar as professors are workers , job security .\nIn Pennsylvania , it \u2019 s all moot . Now , under the stewardship of Jeb Bush \u2019 s former sidekick , tenured faculty are being laid off in droves . The response has been student sit-ins , faculty mobilization and investigations of Enron-style accounting . It \u2019 s a real-time , rolling image of higher education shock therapy \u2014 and a threatening signal to public universities nationwide .\nEdinboro , an 8,000-student campus in northwestern Pennsylvania , is one of 14 schools in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education , or PASSHE . Last September , in the name of \u201c strategic investment for the future vitality of the University , \u201d president Julie Wollman announced that 42 teaching staff , including 18 tenured faculty , would be laid off , or \u201c retrenched . \u201d\n\u201c At first , the students were outraged , \u201d says Crystal Folmar , a senior communications major \u2014 especially , she says , over the wholesale elimination of the school \u2019 s music program . One hundred and fifty students , faculty and staff rallied outside Cole Auditorium . Later , students delivered a 1,200 signature petition to the president \u2019 s office .\nPresident Wollman wasn \u2019 t available , so they sat in . After a little over an hour , she emerged .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the reputation of Edinboro has to be damaged , \u201d she said . \u201c I think it will be damaged if the word goes out that this is a negative thing. \u201d Because of state cuts , enrollment declines and hiring costs , she added , \u201c we don \u2019 t need all the faculty members that we have . \u201d\nA student replied , \u201c We have freshmen that are calling us , and on the 2018 Facebook that are asking , should we even come to Edinboro ? \u201d\nAnother asked , \u201c Why are we spending so much money on buildings when we can \u2019 t pay the faculty ? \u201d\n\u201c The money has not come out of the general budget , \u201d she said , echoing a common belief . \u201c I think I \u2019 ve explained this a number of times . That \u2019 s incorrect . It \u2019 s true that in many states , there are two separate pots of money . \u201d\nThe situation at Edinboro \u2014 layoffs , uproar , blithe financial entreaties \u2014 repeated itself at four other PASSHE schools . By the deadline for retrenchment notices , Clarion posted nine tenured layoffs , East Stroudsburg seven , Slippery Rock one , and Mansfield 22 . Edinboro \u2019 s figure dropped to six , after the school decided to keep its music program . \u201c It felt like a very political play the entire time , \u201d Folmar says . \u201c It was just a bait-and-switch. \u201d After Mansfield pulled several names off its list , the total is now down to 34 .\nStill , as the plan stands , says Jean Jones , a professor of political science at Edinboro , \u201c I think it \u2019 s going to impact enrollment . It \u2019 s all over the press here. \u201d Moreover , \u201c Exciting new young scholars would think twice about coming here to work . I think that applies to administrators as well. \u201d Overall , she says , \u201c Morale is terrible . People are depressed . The thing that worries me in the long term is that this is the new normal . It \u2019 s really just destroying the academic community . A number of faculty have told me that they \u2019 re just going to punch the clock . \u201d\nWhy put all this \u2014 not just the promise of tenure , but the system \u2019 s culture and reputation \u2014 on the chopping block ?\nPart of it is the recession , which governments and universities have parlayed into austerity and privatization . Nationwide , state funding for higher education dropped 28 percent , or $ 2,353 per student , between 2008 and 2013 , according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . All but two states have cut spending during that time , and some , like California , Arizona and Louisiana , have seen hundreds of program and staff cuts . Some universities have merged ; others have pursued taylorist schemes like shared services to attempt to reduce operational costs . In Pennsylvania , Gov . Tom Corbett , a sort of stealth Tea Partyer who rarely lets his persona overshadow his politics , proposed a 53 percent cut to higher education in 2011-2012 \u2014 which the Republican state Legislature whittled to a still-whopping 18 percent .\nThe academic slant of PASSHE \u2019 s cuts also falls in line with national trends \u2014 and Corbett \u2019 s own K-12 fiddling . In a system that began as a network of teacher training schools in the 1800s , arts , humanities and social sciences have given way to vocational training . The PASSHE retrenchment plans rolled out this fall ax not only professors in non-applied fields , but the majors , minors and certificates that they oversee . Over the last five years , the system phased out 158 academic programs while introducing 56 new ones in fields like software engineering , applied science and allied health . Likewise , the state \u2019 s 2012 Higher Education Modernization Act , unanimously backed by the Legislature and signed by the governor , supports programs in workforce-need areas like nursing and finance .\nThese trends are , in part , a function of tuition hikes \u2014 23 percent in PASSHE schools since 2008-2009 \u2014 which disincentivize students from paying for non-applied coursework . With the additional influence of general enrollment declines , traditional programs are threatened with low demand . Those that remain face a vicious spiral : fewer course options , ballooning class sizes and , in turn , pedagogy that \u2019 s less personalized and degrees that are harder to obtain . And , of course , humanistic education is a right-wing bugaboo . As North Carolina \u2019 s conservative Pope Center put it , \u201c One standard to use is whether a center , program , or institute serves and advocates for a political agenda . This is often the case in diversity or multicultural offices , women \u2019 s and ethnic studies centers and programs , and environmental programs . \u201d\nRetrenchment is another ballgame . Tenured faculty layoffs are rare , says Howard Bunsis , an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University and collective bargaining chairman of the American Association of University Professionals . \u201c Most [ faculty contracts ] have protections that say , before you lay off someone in this department , you have to make sure there \u2019 s no other work you can do. \u201d And then , \u201c Before layoffs happen , there has to be a declaration of financial exigency. \u201d In the past few years , retrenchment has cropped up at the University of Louisiana and , in smaller quantities , within PASSHE . In 1977 , the City University of New York , in addition to instituting tuition for the first time , went through a severe bout of retrenchment .\nIn Pennsylvania , administrators warn , it could become more common . \u201c One of our concerns is that we might see this continue in the future , \u201d says Lauren Gutshall , a spokesperson for the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties , or APSCUF . \u201c Looking towards next year and the next two , three or five years , it \u2019 s likely that we \u2019 re going to see this battle come up again and again . \u201d\nIn most cases , shedding faculty is simply a waiting game . Faculty may retire , or find jobs elsewhere , prompting nonrenewal of their tenure lines or replacement with adjuncts . Under these trends , the tenured or tenure-track professoriate plummeted from 57 percent of all college professors in 1975 to 31 percent in 2007 . Retrenchment is a blunter device \u2014 a quick fix for universities crying exigency . On the flip side , it rolls back job security already in place , and an age-old academic tradition .\nIt \u2019 s also , in Pennsylvania , not the only possible fix . Down the rabbit hole , the system \u2019 s finances are an Enron-esque tangle .\nAs Kutztown University professor Kevin Mahoney details in the Pennsylvania-based Raging Chicken Press , under Democratic Gov . Ed Rendell \u2019 s administration , PASSHE began shifting its revenue model \u2014 and , arguably , its mission \u2014 to raising private funding through capital campaigns . This funding would go to \u201c off-balance-sheet \u201d entities , like campus-based foundations , to support new buildings , ranging from mall-like dorms to Edinboro \u2019 s sky bridge . While Edinboro \u2019 s president is right that capital budgets and operating budgets are usually separate , at PASSHE , universities began funneling money meant for education into these public-private entities to cover interest and principal on capital bonds . The upshot ? Money that could be used to pay tenured faculty is helping fund student dorms .\nLast month , APSCUF released an independent audit of the seven PASSHE schools that are , or at one point were considering , retrenching . The numbers aren \u2019 t pretty . The audit shows widespread discrepancies between universities \u2019 budget projections \u2014 and , in turn , their ability to afford faculty salaries and benefits \u2014 and what their actual budgets turn out to be . At Edinboro , for example , they find an average yearly over-budgeting of $ 1 million in faculty salaries and $ 1 million in benefits between 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 . \u201c There \u2019 s a case to be made about why you do that , \u201d Mahoney says , referring to conservative budgeting for personnel costs . \u201c But what happens to the difference ? \u201d\nWhile there \u2019 s no direct line between the money skimmed from salary and benefit discrepancies and increased revenues for capital projects , the auditors note that with operating costs in the black , \u201c additional cash flow has been used for debt service and capital projects. \u201d The high debt-to-equity ratio of these projects , they add , makes campuses riskier to invest in . Overall , they say , \u201c Without strict oversight of these budgets , University management should be extremely cautious when utilizing these budgets to project faculty and other personnel retrenchment in 2013/14 and forward. \u201d As Jones contends , \u201c They \u2019 re not very good at budgeting . Given that your budgets didn \u2019 t match up with your actuals for the past five years , what are the implications for this year ? \u201d\nAsked what kind of influence off-balance-sheet budgeting has had on university policy , PASSHE spokesperson Kenn Marshall says , \u201c None . We don \u2019 t believe the report accurately reflects the situation on the campuses. \u201d He points to chancellor Frank Brogan \u2019 s response to the audit , which cites \u201c obvious errors \u201d and states , \u201c Tuition dollars and PASSHE \u2019 s annual state appropriation are not used to fund student housing , nor any other auxiliary operation . \u201d\nIn general , the system \u2019 s attitude toward retrenchment is lukewarm . \u201c These were extraordinary circumstances that our universities are dealing with , \u201d Marshall says . \u201c It was unfortunate but necessary. \u201d As Brogan affirmed at a Kutztown meeting last month , \u201c We are not , nor should we ever become , gigantic vocational , technical facilities . That balanced approach is what separates us from so many other educational delivery systems . \u201d\nSo goes the neoliberal university : managers intent on reinventing the system by any means necessary , and rank-and-file stakeholders \u2014 staff , students , prospective students \u2014 catered a \u201c balanced approach \u201d that increasingly slants away from comprehensive education and transparent governance .\nAnd who better than chancellor Brogan to shepherd PASSHE into the new normal ?\nIn August , Brogan came to Harrisburg after two decades of state office in Florida . As commissioner of education , and then as lieutenant governor under Jeb Bush , Mahoney details , Brogan became a leading figure in the marketization of public education \u2014 helping Florida become one of two states earning as high as a B- on Michelle Rhee \u2019 s ledger . Meanwhile , he helmed the Education Leaders Council , founded in 1995 to lobby for privatization-friendly reform . And in 2001 , President George W. Bush appointed him to his 31-person education advisory team . Guido Pichini , the chairman of PASSHE \u2019 s Board of Governors , who selected Brogan , has a record to match : His security company , Security Guards Inc. , has made upward of $ 4.5 million from outsourced PASSHE services ; as a Heritage Foundation Associate , his contributions to right-wing causes top $ 10,000 .\nThis year \u2019 s retrenchment warnings predate Brogan \u2019 s tenure at PASSHE , so it \u2019 s unclear what role , if any , he played in the final calculations . \u201c Each of the universities spent a lot of time developing workforce plans , looking at enrollments , \u201d Marshall says . \u201c They met with various campus groups . They worked on an individual campus-by-campus basis. \u201d Still , as the campus-by-campus saga unfolds , Brogan seems intent on realizing the system \u2019 s makeover . \u201c Make no doubt about it , \u201d he said , at an Oct. 10 media briefing , \u201c retrenchment is here . \u201d\nThe opposition is moving in fits and starts . Last March , PASSHE faculty emerged from a contentious two-year-long contract fight , in which the system sought increases in temporary faculty and a variety of other workforce cuts . ( The fruits of that fight , including retroactive raises , are often cited by administrators as an impetus for further cuts . ) \u201c We just literally signed the contract , \u201d Jones says . \u201c We haven \u2019 t stopped. \u201d And yet , \u201c This is , for the local campus , far worse than the negotiations . This is , we \u2019 re fighting with our local admins \u2014 and it \u2019 s much more real and close and personal. \u201d In November , APSCUF hired three staff organizers to help with the mobilization , as campus-based union heads only get partial release time from teaching . While students and staff have assembled for rallies and speakouts across the state , activists register creeping burnout \u2014 and , for faculty on the retrenchment line , fear .\nBy March 1 of this year , first-year tenure-track faculty could still be targeted for cuts . As the spring approaches , the union will attempt to negotiate the remaining retrenchments off the table , continuing to press alternative pathways for raising revenue and tightening operations . It has also commissioned an additional audit for the remaining seven PASSHE schools . For its part , PASSHE \u2019 s Board of Governors is requesting a 4 percent infusion in base funding from the state and a one-time $ 18 million check to fund new programs .\nAs Mahoney argues , the fight isn \u2019 t just to save jobs , but to stave off no-alternative defeatism . \u201c It \u2019 s the narrative that constantly gets reported again and again that becomes common sense : \u2018 Higher education is facing difficult times . Everybody is struggling back and forth , feeling bad , and there \u2019 s nothing we can do. \u2019 If that \u2019 s as far as you \u2019 re going to dig into the reporting , you \u2019 re going to lose higher ed . \u201d",

This is, we\u2019re fighting with our local admins \u2014 and it\u2019s much more real and close and personal.\u201d In November, APSCUF hired three staff organizers to help with the mobilization, as campus-based union heads only get partial release time from teaching. While students and staff have assembled for rallies and speakouts across the state, activists register creeping burnout \u2014 and, for faculty on the retrenchment line, fear.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBy March 1 of this year, first-year tenure-track faculty could still be targeted for cuts. As the spring approaches, the union will attempt to negotiate the remaining retrenchments off the table, continuing to press alternative pathways for raising revenue and tightening operations. It has also commissioned an additional audit for the remaining seven PASSHE schools. For its part, PASSHE\u2019s Board of Governors is requesting a 4 percent infusion in base funding from the state and a one-time $18 million check to fund new programs.\n\nAs Mahoney argues, the fight isn\u2019t just to save jobs, but to stave off no-alternative defeatism. \u201cIt\u2019s the narrative that constantly gets reported again and again that becomes common sense: \u2018Higher education is facing difficult times. Everybody is struggling back and forth, feeling bad, and there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u2019 If that\u2019s as far as you\u2019re going to dig into the reporting, you\u2019re going to lose higher ed.\u201d",
