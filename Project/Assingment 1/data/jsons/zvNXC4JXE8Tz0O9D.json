The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls ! \u201d\nIn 2004 , that \u2019 s how ex-Daily Show anchor Jon Stewart famously rebutted Crossfire host Tucker Carlson \u2019 s allegation that he had gone too soft on John Kerry . Seven years later , Stewart would tell Chris Wallace that he was \u201c a comedian first \u201d after the Fox News host accused him of making a \u201c political comment \u201d about Sarah Palin .\nOf course , by the time Stewart left the Daily Show , it was clear that he wasn \u2019 t \u201c just a comedian . \u201d\nAs Pew Research Center data showed , 12 percent of Americans got their news , in part , from the Daily Show during Stewart \u2019 s tenure , which put the size of his audience \u201c on par with that of USA Today and The Huffington Post. \u201d And although most Americans told Pew that they primarily watched Stewart for entertainment purposes , at least 10 percent of Daily Show viewers said they turned to the show for the \u201c latest headlines . \u201d\nWhether he liked it or not , Jon Stewart was something of a journalist\u2014at least enough of one that he tied with Anderson Cooper , Tom Brokaw , and Dan Rather in a 2007 survey of most admired journalists .\n\u201c No , we \u2019 re a technology company . We \u2019 re not a media company . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to a question in late August about the role his company plays in the media . And much like Stewart \u2019 s repeated insistence that he was not a journalist , something about Zuckerberg \u2019 s refusal to characterize Facebook as a \u201c media company \u201d seems to have rung hollow .\nMedia outlets including Fortune , Business Insider , Recode , Mashable and the New York Times have all run articles and opinion pieces insisting that yes , Facebook is indeed a media company . And earlier this week , Gizmodo needled the social media giant with the clever headline : \u201c Facebook\u2014Definitely Not a Media Company\u2014Will Broadcast the Presidential Debates . \u201d\nIt has been less than a month since Zuckerberg said that Facebook wasn \u2019 t a media company and already , it \u2019 s about as hard to believe him as it was to buy into Stewart \u2019 s \u201c just a comedian \u201d defense over a decade ago .\nFacebook itself may not be helping Zuckerberg \u2019 s case . In addition to broadcasting the presidential debates , the company will also be \u201c providing data to the moderators in the weeks leading up to the debates on what people are searching and saying about the election , the candidates , and the issues , \u201d the Commission on Presidential Debates announced last week . The social media company will also help \u201c source questions \u201d for the town-hall debate .\nTo be fair , it \u2019 s up to the moderators themselves which questions they ultimately ask Trump and Clinton\u2014The Hill reported that Facebook \u2019 s role would be \u201c advisory , \u201d citing a Facebook spokesperson\u2014but sourcing questions , supplying information , and serving as the \u201c exclusive social media sponsor \u201d for two of the debates is still a remarkably active role for a mere \u201c technology company \u201d to play in an election cycle .\nIn response to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s question about whether or not Facebook still does not consider itself to be a media company given this level of involvement , a spokesperson referred to a comment made by Adam Mosseri , the company \u2019 s VP of Project Management for the News Feed , at a tech conference last week .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to figure out what people are interested in , we \u2019 re trying to figure out how to connect people with the sources of content that they find meaningful , we \u2019 re trying to figure out how to write stories based on how relevant they are to people , \u201d Mosseri said . \u201c These problems are primarily technical in nature , which is why we think of ourselves as a technology company . \u201d\nHe continued : \u201c That said , we know we play a meaningful role in media . A lot of people read their news on Facebook and read other types of media on Facebook and so it \u2019 s important to us that we are good partners with publishers in the media industry . \u201d\nAt what point , though , does a meaningful role become so meaningful that you are part of an industry in which you participate ? And how is connecting people with meaningful sources fundamentally different from what media companies try to do every day ?\nMosseri is right about one thing : A lot of people do read their news on Facebook . A full two-thirds of Facebook users now get news on the social networking site , according to Pew data . That \u2019 s up from 47 percent three years ago . Given that nearly two-thirds of the adult U.S. population uses Facebook , well over 100 million Americans get their news , at least sometimes , through what was once a networking website for college students .\nIf Facebook were not such a massive source of news \u2014or even if it deferred curation to community moderators like Reddit does\u2014it might be easier to argue that it \u2019 s \u201c just a tech company. \u201d But when the very fate of digital publishing is wedded to the company \u2019 s mysterious algorithms , that case gets harder to make .\nIndeed , Mosseri \u2019 s insistence that connecting people with sources is a \u201c primarily technical problem \u201d comes after weeks of controversy over Facebook \u2019 s Trending feature\u2014months that have arguably proven that only an experienced team of humans with editorial experience can forge those connections .\nIn late August , Facebook fired the editorial staff on its Trending team , three months after former employees alleged in a May Gizmodo report that they \u201c suppressed \u201d conservative news outlets in the news-focused sidebar .\nIn some cases , this may have been a matter of ensuring reliable sourcing : Breitbart , for example , has published some truly questionable content and therefore , it might make sense to subject its stories to more scrutiny before placing them in front of millions of eyes .
