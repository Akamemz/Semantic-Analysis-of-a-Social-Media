Bush , who has many admirers in the Republican establishment .\nIt was hard to declare a winner in the debate amid the constant volley of insults , not all of them from Trump . Cruz and fellow Senator Marco Rubio also took pointed jabs at each other over illegal immigration .\nBut Trump dominated the debate conservation on Twitter with 40 percent of the mentions , according to data from the micro-blogging platform .\nTrump 's combative style has set the tone for much of the campaign but in recent days he had pledged to pursue a more measured , positive approach . At the debate , that strategy lasted only through his comments about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , who was found dead on Saturday .\nTrump was quickly goaded when Bush criticized Trump 's past statements that Russia has a role to play in Syria . Russia , Bush said , is not attacking Islamic State militants but instead helping Syrian President Bashir Assad , who Washington wants to leave power .\nTrump blasted Bush 's brother for launching the Iraq war in 2003 over claims , later proven false , that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .\n`` A big , fat mistake , '' said Trump , noting that the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks had also occurred on Bush 's watch .\n`` George Bush made a mistake , '' Trump thundered . `` We all make mistakes .
