    "content": "President Obama and Tim Kaine tag-teamed to deliver a scorching warm-up Wednesday for Hillary Clinton to accept the party \u2019 s nomination for president at the Democratic convention , with the president accusing Republican Donald Trump of only offering \u201c slogans \u201d and \u201c fear \u201d \u2013 and Clinton \u2019 s newly tapped running mate almost upstaging the commander-in-chief with his gusty impression of the billionaire \u2019 s New Yawk bravado .\nFraming the election as a choice between pessimism and optimism , Obama endorsed Clinton as a tough and tenacious leader , saying \u201c she is fit \u201d and \u201c ready \u201d to be the next commander-in-chief \u2013 while rejecting Trump \u2019 s claim that only he can cure the nation \u2019 s ills .\n\u201c America is already great . America is already strong , \u201d Obama said . \u201c And I promise you , our strength , our greatness , does not depend on Donald Trump . \u201d\nOf Clinton , he said : \u201c There has never been a man or a woman \u2013 not me , not Bill , nobody \u2013 more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America . \u201d\nAs the kicker , Clinton surprised the crowd by showing up onstage with Obama at the end of his speech , the two of them hugging and waving to delegates who were holding up `` thank you '' signs .\nThe president \u2019 s convention embrace of his one-time political rival is sure to fuel a central charge of Republicans in the general election \u2013 that Clinton represents a third Obama term , and the status quo . Without question , the sitting president depends on his former secretary of state to help preserve his legacy , and fend off recurring Republican attempts to repeal ObamaCare , upend environmental regulations and more .\nTo that end , Obama and a host of speakers on the convention \u2019 s third night intensified their attacks on Trump , as they talked up Clinton \u2019 s qualifications .\n\u201c The Donald is not really a plans guy .
