    "content": "TOBA , Japan -- There is the soaring rhetoric . And then there 's the messy reality .\nWhen President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe make an historic visit to Hiroshima on Friday -- the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited the site of the first atomic bomb attack -- their words advocating nuclear disarmament will clash with real-world security necessities .\nFar from backing up the vision of a world without nuclear bombs that Obama laid out in a 2009 speech that helped secure a Nobel Peace Prize , his near-finished presidency has seen a multibillion-dollar modernization of the U.S. nuclear force .\nWatching from the audience will be at least three Japanese survivors of the U.S. nuclear attacks , according to the Kyodo news agency .\nJapan 's long postwar commitment to disarmament , meanwhile , is only possible because of its reliance on the so-called American `` nuclear umbrella '' that protects it from antagonistic North Korea and China . Tokyo , should it choose , could probably easily convert its advanced civilian nuclear program into a weapons program , and some conservatives in Abe 's ruling party have argued that the country 's pacifist constitution technically allows nuclear weapons .\nDespite his own mixed record on nukes , Obama likely sees his Hiroshima visit as a worthwhile expenditure of political capital in order to shore up a global nonproliferation effort that seems at times to be crumbling .\nBefore the most recent of a series of nuclear security summits meant to reduce and protect nuclear material , Obama wrote in March that eliminating all nuclear weapons may not happen in his lifetime . `` But we have begun . As the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons , the United States has a moral obligation to continue to lead the way in eliminating them . Still , no one nation can realize this vision alone . It must be the work of the world . ''\nObama 's vision of a world without nuclear weapons was challenged almost immediately .\nHis April 2009 speech in Prague happened within hours of North Korea 's launch of a long-range rocket that outsiders , including the United Nations , called a cover for a test of banned missile technology . Pyongyang is still barreling ahead in its push for nuclear-armed missiles that could reach the U.S. mainland .\nObama secured a deal meant to limit Iran 's nuclear program , if it can be implemented amid mistrust on both sides . But Pakistan and India are still locked in a nuclear standoff . The United States and Russia , which have most of the world 's nuclear weapons , often see their geopolitical jockeying for position interfere with disarmament efforts . And there are growing worries about the security of nuclear fuel sites around the world .\nObama 's trip to Hiroshima also comes amid anxiety that North Korea 's growing nuclear and missile capabilities could lead to the top U.S. allies in Asia , Japan and South Korea , starting their own nuclear weapons programs .\nIt is highly unlikely either country will go nuclear . It could cause huge political and economic damage - crippling sanctions , global condemnation - and jeopardize their alliances with the United States .\nBut a small group in South Korea , including some conservative members of the ruling party , and some in Japan see the North Korean danger as too grave to rely only on the protection of another country . They also question whether , despite rhetoric from U.S. officials about an `` ironclad '' alliance , Washington would really use nuclear weapons and risk the lives of thousands of American troops should a belligerent North Korea attack .\nThe Chosun Ilbo , South Korea 's top newspaper by circulation , said in an editorial weeks after North Korea 's nuclear test in January that discussions in Seoul on acquiring nuclear weapons were inevitable .\nJudging by the level of American involvement in crises in Ukraine and Syria , for example , the newspaper said any U.S. help would come only after Seoul is turned into a `` pile of ashes '' by a North Korean nuclear attack .\nThis fear has been highlighted by Donald Trump , the presumptive presidential nominee for the Republican party in the United States .

The Japanese would certainly be happier if no one had nuclear weapons , but as long as several of its neighbors have them , they welcome being under America 's nuclear umbrella .
