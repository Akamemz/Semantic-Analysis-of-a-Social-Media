The public responses decidedly were not.\n\nFrom his survey results, published recently in the sociological journal Social Currents, here's one response that reflected the majority of opposition to same-sex marriage: \"Because I don't believe God intended them to be that way.\"\n\n\"It's beastly,\" said another. A third: \"Well, they're sinners.\"\n\nPowell acknowledges there is nothing wrong with showing moral disapproval. People have a right to their beliefs and values.\n\nBut, if public opinion \u2014 either through pressure on lawmakers or directly at the ballot box \u2014 drives public policy, Powell's research suggests that the real motivation for banning same-sex marriage is moral disapproval over homosexuality.\n\nAnd that, he says, could present a particular challenge for supporters of traditional marriage: Moral disapproval doesn't make a valid legal case.
