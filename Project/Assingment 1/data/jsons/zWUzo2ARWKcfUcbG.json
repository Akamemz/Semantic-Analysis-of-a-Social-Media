The social distancing guidelines recommend Americans work from home and avoid groups larger than 10 .\nWASHINGTON \u2013 With the number of coronavirus deaths rising , President Donald Trump warned Americans on Tuesday to prepare for what he said would be difficult days ahead .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to go through a very rough two weeks , \u201d he said during a news conference with his coronavirus task force .\nTrump \u2019 s remarks came as the number of coronavirus deaths surged past 3,200 on Tuesday , eclipsing the death total from the 9/11 terror attacks . More than 500 deaths were reported nationwide Monday , the highest daily total since the first American died six weeks ago .\nTrump indicated the worst isn \u2019 t over , warning of a \u201c very , very painful two weeks '' ahead .\n\u201c As a nation , we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that really important day when we \u2019 re going to see things get better , \u201d he said . \u201c Our strength will be tested , and our endurance will be tried . This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part . \u201d\nPelosi says she , Congress are not responsible for slow response\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama appeared to take a swipe at President Donald Trump 's initial skepticism of the coronavirus pandemic , a rare rebuff for a president who tends not to weigh in on the work of other presidents .\n`` We 've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic , '' Obama tweeted Tuesday , without directly naming the president . `` We ca n't afford any more consequences of climate denial . All of us , especially young people , have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall , '' he added , linking to an article announcing the rollback of environmental mileage standards put in place by Obama in 2012 .\nThe Trump administration has faced sharp criticism for its handling of the U.S. outbreak , which has crippled the U.S. economy and claimed more than 3,100 lives as of Tuesday . Trump initially sought to downplay the pandemic and suggested opening up the economy by Easter , or April 12 , as recently as last week . The president has since said strict social distancing guidelines will remain in place through April 30 .\nObama , who has mostly used his Twitter account to praise workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and promote advice from public health experts , seldom weighs in on Trump 's record .\nThe 44th president 's tweet also blasted Trump 's decision to roll back an Obama-era rule designed to push automakers to produce more fuel efficient vehicles to limit pollution in the global fight against climate change . The new mileage standard is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to reverse his predecessor 's policies .\nVirginia GOP suggests politics at play in Northam 's 'stay at home ' order\nThe Republican Party of Virginia suggested Tuesday that Democratic Gov . Ralph Northam set his statewide `` stay at home '' order to expire on June 10 because the GOP primary is going to be held on June 9 .\n\u201c In these challenging times , we want to give the Governor the freedom to make necessary decisions without partisan rancor , but the timeline seems all too convenient , \u201d said party chairman Jack Wilson . \u201c We ask that Governor Northam show us the data that led to his decision . ''\nWilson said while they were not implying Northam was `` purposefully engaging in voter suppression , '' an `` explanation would help to mitigate any concerns . \u201d\nOn Monday , Northam ordered Virginia residents to stay home , except for certain activities like getting groceries or to get medical care , in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus . Virginia has 1,250 confirmed cases of the virus , which has killed at least 27 people in the state , according to the Virginia Department of Health .\nVirginia 's Republican Party canceled its presidential primary this year , citing overwhelming support for President Donald Trump . But GOP voters still have to decide on who will try to unseat incumbent Sen. Mark Warner , as well as races for House members and local representatives .\nAs New York continues its search for much-needed ventilators , Gov . Andrew Cuomo said the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u201c basically bigfooted \u201d individual states and drove up prices , comparing buying ventilators to online auctions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like being on eBay with 50 other states , bidding on a ventilator , \u201d Cuomo said . \u201c You see the bid go up cause California bid . Illinois bid . Florida bid . New York bid . California rebids . That \u2019 s literally what we \u2019 re doing . I mean , how inefficient . And then , FEMA gets involved and FEMA starts bidding . And now FEMA is bidding on top of the 50 , so FEMA is driving up the price . What sense does this make ? \u201d\nCuomo then said he believes FEMA \u201c should \u2019 ve been the purchasing agent \u201d for medical equipment before becoming the sole distributor to states in need .\nCuomo released data indicating New York had more than 75,000 positive cases \u2013 including more than 9,000 new cases \u2013 with a death toll of 1,550 , as of Tuesday morning .\nPompeo : no need to ease sanctions on Iran , other nations affected by coronavirus\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that he saw no need to ease tough U.S. sanctions on Iran or other nations that have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic .\nThe United Nations Secretary-General , Ant\u00f3nio Guterres , has urged world leaders to back off such crippling economic penalties to ensure that people in those targeted countries have access to food , medicine and other vital supplies as they confront the pandemic .\n\u201c This is the time for solidarity not exclusion , \u201d Guterres said last week .\nPompeo has overseen the Trump administration \u2019 s \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign against Iran , implementing a series of escalating sanctions aimed at crippling Tehran \u2019 s economy and weakening its leaders .\nIran is reeling from the coronavirus outbreak , with more than 40,000 reported infections and nearly 3,000 reported deaths . Skeptics say those figures are misleadingly low , fearing a much more widespread crisis .\nPompeo noted that U.S. sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian goods , and he argued that Iran , Venezuela and other countries should be able to get anything they need to address the pandemic .\n\u201c The goods that are needed for each of these countries to resolve that coronavirus problem in their nations are not sanctioned , \u201d Pompeo said during a State Department briefing Tuesday .\nPompeo said the Trump administration has offered humanitarian aid to Iran , North Korea , and Venezuela , among other sanctioned countries , but that assistance has been rejected .\n\u201c Some of these countries continue to build bombs and missiles and nuclear capability , all the while their people are starving , \u201d he said .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that a State Department official has died from COVID-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus .\n\u201c We 've had a State Department official pass away as a result of this virus ... one of our team members , \u201d Pompeo said during a briefing Tuesday . \u201c We now have 3,000 Americans who have been killed . This is tragic . \u201d\nA State Department spokesperson later said two locally employed staff members at U.S. embassies in Jakarta , Indonesia , and Kinshasa , Congo , have died from COVID-19 .\n\u201c We offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families affected by this tragedy , and thank them for their loved ones ' service to the United States , \u201d said the spokesperson , who was not authorized to speak on the record because of State Department policy . \u201c We do not at this time have any reports of COVID-19-related deaths of American staff within the Department of State 's domestic and global workforce . \u201d\nThe State Department \u2019 s 75,000-workforce \u2013 deployed in more than 200 locations across the globe \u2013 has been deeply affected by the pandemic . In January , the agency began evacuating diplomats from the U.S. consulate in Wuhan , China , the outbreak \u2019 s initial epicenter , and authorized departures have continued from other hotspots .\n\u201c Really there aren \u2019 t any posts that are immune to the spread of coronavirus , \u201d Dr. William Walters , the agency \u2019 s deputy chief medical officer for operations , told reporters during a Monday briefing .\nWalters said there are about 75 known cases among State Department employees working abroad and about 30 cases among the agency \u2019 s U.S.-based workforce .\nRep. Max Rose to deploy for National Guard to help NY coronavirus response\nFreshman Rep. Max Rose , D-N.Y. , will deploy Wednesday for the National Guard to help his state 's coronavirus efforts .\nHe will deploy to Staten Island and serve as an operations officer . Rose , a Purple Heart recipient who served in Afghanistan , said he would be able to leave his post to vote on another coronavirus package if needed . Rose represents Staten Island , New York City 's southernmost borough .\n`` My activation and deployment is nothing compared to what our city , state , and country has asked of all them . And it \u2019 s certainly nothing compared to the other men and women serving in uniform both here at home and overseas , '' Rose said . `` I am just trying to do my duty and my small part . \u201d\nNew York has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. and on Monday , a Navy hospital ship arrived in Manhattan 's harbor to help treat the thousands who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak will likely require the country to move toward voting by mail in upcoming elections .\nPelosi said on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe '' she thought the $ 2 trillion CARES Act signed into law last week by President Donald Trump should have had more funding for the states to address `` the reality of life that we are going to have to have more vote by mail . '' The final bill allocated $ 400 million toward helping states vote during the outbreak , while the Democratic version of the legislation included $ 4 billion for that purpose .\nPresident Donald Trump criticized the effort to include funding for elections in the bill during a Fox News interview on Monday .\n`` The things they had in there were crazy . They had things \u2013 levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you \u2019 d never have a Republican elected in this country again , '' the president said on `` Fox & Friends . ''\n`` I feel sad that the President does n't have confidence in his own party , '' Pelosi said Tuesday . She said she did not think vote by mail would negatively affect Republicans ' chances to the polls .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , added his name Tuesday to the list of people who blamed the slow response to the coronavirus on President Donald Trump 's impeachment .\nThe Senate impeachment trial \u2013 which began with the swearing-in of senators on Jan. 16 and ended with Trump 's acquittal on Feb. 5 \u2013 `` diverted the attention of the government , '' McConnell told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt .\nTrump critics have described the impeachment argument \u2013 one employed by many Trump supporters in recent weeks \u2013 as an excuse .\nTrump , they noted , began taking questions about coronavirus in January and downplayed the threat until late February , well after the trial ended .\nTrump supporters like Sean Hannity have long claimed that impeachment diverted the government 's attention from issues like the coronavirus .\nAlso on the Hewitt show Tuesday , Sen. Tom Cotton , R-Ark. , said : `` I have to tell you that in mid-January and late-January , unfortunately , Washington , especially the Congress , was consumed with another matter \u2013 you may recall the partisan impeachment of the President . ''\nOn Feb. 27 , Trump said during a speech at the White House that the virus was `` going to disappear . One day \u2013 it 's like a miracle , it will disappear . '' He then said , `` you know , it could get worse before it gets better . It could maybe go away . We 'll see what happens . ''\nThree weeks before , the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Trump of House impeachment charges that he abused power and obstructed a congressional investigation into his team 's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic political opponent Joe Biden .\nMaryland Gov . Larry Hogan said Tuesday on NPR 's Morning Edition that President Donald Trump was incorrect in saying coronavirus testing problems had been resolved .\n`` Yeah , that 's just not true . I mean I know that they 've taken some steps to create new tests , but they 're not actually produced and distributed out to the states . '' Hogan said , when host Rachel Martin asked him about Trump 's assertions . `` No state has enough testing . ''\nIn a coronavirus task force briefing yesterday , Trump said America 's coronavirus testing was better `` than any country in the world . ''\nThe Maryland Republican said he was listening to the `` smart team '' in the White House like Drs . Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci who were giving accurate information .\nHogan , who issued a statewide stay-at-home order on Monday , had a grim outlook for states ' pandemic preparedness .\nPelosi : she and Congress do not take responsibility for slow coronavirus response\nIn a Tuesday morning interview on MSNBC 's Morning Joe , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Congress do not take responsibility for the country 's slow response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the year .\n`` No , not at all , '' she said Tuesday on MSNBC in response to a question from co-host Willie Geist about whether she or Congress bore responsibility .\nInstead , she said she was `` proud '' of the work Congress did , the `` speed '' with which coronavirus response bills passed , and the `` bipartisanship that was the hallmark of it all . ''\n`` We can only go as fast as the signature , '' she said of the White House 's support for legislation .\nThe House Speaker added that she was `` sad '' there was `` no respect for science '' from the White House in the beginning but President Donald Trump `` will say and do what he does . ''\nPentagon watchdog to oversee $ 2 trillion in coronavirus relief funds\nGlenn Fine , the inspector general for the Defense Department , was appointed to head the committee that will oversee the largest rescue package in U.S. history .\nThe Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act , which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last week , provides more than $ 2 trillion to help stave off the economic IMPACTS caused by the COVID-19 outbreak that has now killed more than 3,000 people in the U.S. and nearly 40,000 people worldwide .\nThe CARES Act calls for the establishment of a Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to oversee the distribution of the funds approved in the massive stimulus bill , as well as the two previous emergency spending bills that were passed to address the outbreak . Fine will head that nine-person committee composed of inspector generals from other departments .\n`` I look forward to working with my fellow Inspectors General on the Committee to provide effective , independent oversight of the funding provided by the pandemic legislation , '' Fine said in a statement on Monday . `` Through our efforts , we will seek to promote transparency and ensure that funds are being used consistently with the law \u2019 s mandate to respond to this public health crises . ''\n'Much of it was junk \u2019 : Trump , Pelosi claim credit for beating back bad ideas in coronavirus stimulus\nDuring the contentious debate ahead of the final bill 's passage , the establishment of an oversight committee to prevent waste and abuse was insisted upon by congressional Democrats who were particularly concerned that the nearly $ 500 billion allocated to help large industries could become a corporate `` slush fund . ''\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , said he was pleased with Fine 's appointment .\n`` The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is critical to holding President Trump and his administration accountable to the letter and spirit of the law , '' Schumer said in a statement . `` Glenn Fine has a good reputation as a tough federal prosecutor and former DOJ Inspector General , and must exercise his full oversight authority to ensure that the Trump administration implements the CARES Act as intended . ''\nPresident Donald Trump 's rocky relationship with the news media was on display again Monday , as he bristled at questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak during a White House news conference .\nCNN 's Jim Acosta \u2013 with whom Trump has clashed on several occasions , including a 2018 exchange that led to a failed White House effort to revoke Acosta 's press credentials \u2013 asked the president , `` What do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months ? ''\nAcosta proceeded to quote several of Trump 's earlier comments in which he said the outbreak `` was very much under control '' and that `` it will go away '' like a `` miracle . ''\n`` It will go away . And we 're going to have a great victory , '' Trump told Acosta . He went on to defend the accuracy of the previous comments while simultaneously explaining he said them because , `` I want to keep the country calm . I do n't want panic in the country . ''\n`` I could cause panic much better than even you . I would make you look like a minor league player , '' Trump told Acosta . `` Instead of asking a nasty , snarky question like that , you should ask a real question . ''\nCoronavirus : Justice Department launches inquiry of senators who sold large chunks of stock before coronavirus market slide\nTrump later turned his ire on PBS NewsHour 's Yamiche Alcindor , whom he told the previous day to `` be nice '' and not ask `` threatening questions '' after she asked about his statement that New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo was requesting more ventilators than needed .\nOn Monday , Alcindor asked Trump why the U.S. trailed South Korea in per capita testing for the virus .\n`` I know South Korea better than anybody , '' Trump replied . `` You know how many people are in Seoul ? You know how big the city of Seoul is ? '' he asked , trying to explain that the difference was due to population density . Trump then claimed Seoul 's population is 38 million when , according to the city 's government , it is actually about 10 million .\n`` You should be saying , congratulations to the men and women who have done this job , who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great , '' Trump said to Alcindor . `` And if you don \u2019 t say it , I \u2019 ll say it . I want to congratulate all of the people , you have done a fantastic job . ''",

The social distancing guidelines recommend Americans work from home and avoid groups larger than 10.\n\n\u2013 John Fritze\n\nTrump: Americans face 'very, very painful two weeks'\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 With the number of coronavirus deaths rising, President Donald Trump warned Americans on Tuesday to prepare for what he said would be difficult days ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through a very rough two weeks,\u201d he said during a news conference with his coronavirus task force.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came as the number of coronavirus deaths surged past 3,200 on Tuesday, eclipsing the death total from the 9/11 terror attacks. More than 500 deaths were reported nationwide Monday, the highest daily total since the first American died six weeks ago.\n\nTrump indicated the worst isn\u2019t over, warning of a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\" ahead.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that really important day when we\u2019re going to see things get better,\u201d he said. \u201cOur strength will be tested, and our endurance will be tried. This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nPelosi says she, Congress are not responsible for slow response\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama appeared to take a swipe at President Donald Trump's initial skepticism of the coronavirus pandemic, a rare rebuff for a president who tends not to weigh in on the work of other presidents.\n\n\"We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,\" Obama tweeted Tuesday, without directly naming the president. \"We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall,\" he added, linking to an article announcing the rollback of environmental mileage standards put in place by Obama in 2012.\n\nThe Trump administration has faced sharp criticism for its handling of the U.S. outbreak, which has crippled the U.S. economy and claimed more than 3,100 lives as of Tuesday. Trump initially sought to downplay the pandemic and suggested opening up the economy by Easter, or April 12, as recently as last week. The president has since said strict social distancing guidelines will remain in place through April 30.\n\nObama, who has mostly used his Twitter account to praise workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and promote advice from public health experts, seldom weighs in on Trump's record.\n\nThe 44th president's tweet also blasted Trump's decision to roll back an Obama-era rule designed to push automakers to produce more fuel efficient vehicles to limit pollution in the global fight against climate change. The new mileage standard is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to reverse his predecessor's policies.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nVirginia GOP suggests politics at play in Northam's 'stay at home' order\n\nThe Republican Party of Virginia suggested Tuesday that Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam set his statewide \"stay at home\" order to expire on June 10 because the GOP primary is going to be held on June 9.\n\n\u201cIn these challenging times, we want to give the Governor the freedom to make necessary decisions without partisan rancor, but the timeline seems all too convenient,\u201d said party chairman Jack Wilson. \u201cWe ask that Governor Northam show us the data that led to his decision.\"\n\nWilson said while they were not implying Northam was \"purposefully engaging in voter suppression,\" an \"explanation would help to mitigate any concerns.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Northam ordered Virginia residents to stay home, except for certain activities like getting groceries or to get medical care, in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Virginia has 1,250 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed at least 27 people in the state, according to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nVirginia's Republican Party canceled its presidential primary this year, citing overwhelming support for President Donald Trump. But GOP voters still have to decide on who will try to unseat incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, as well as races for House members and local representatives.\n\n- William Cummings\n\nCuomo: FEMA 'bigfooted' states, drove up ventilator prices\n\nAs New York continues its search for much-needed ventilators, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u201cbasically bigfooted\u201d individual states and drove up prices, comparing buying ventilators to online auctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou see the bid go up cause California bid. Illinois bid. Florida bid. New York bid. California rebids. That\u2019s literally what we\u2019re doing. I mean, how inefficient. And then, FEMA gets involved and FEMA starts bidding. And now FEMA is bidding on top of the 50, so FEMA is driving up the price. What sense does this make?\u201d\n\nCuomo then said he believes FEMA \u201cshould\u2019ve been the purchasing agent\u201d for medical equipment before becoming the sole distributor to states in need.\n\nCuomo released data indicating New York had more than 75,000 positive cases \u2013 including more than 9,000 new cases \u2013 with a death toll of 1,550, as of Tuesday morning.\n\n- Lorenzo Reyes\n\nPompeo: no need to ease sanctions on Iran, other nations affected by coronavirus\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that he saw no need to ease tough U.S. sanctions on Iran or other nations that have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has urged world leaders to back off such crippling economic penalties to ensure that people in those targeted countries have access to food, medicine and other vital supplies as they confront the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for solidarity not exclusion,\u201d Guterres said last week.\n\nPompeo has overseen the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran, implementing a series of escalating sanctions aimed at crippling Tehran\u2019s economy and weakening its leaders.\n\nIran is reeling from the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 40,000 reported infections and nearly 3,000 reported deaths. Skeptics say those figures are misleadingly low, fearing a much more widespread crisis.\n\nPompeo noted that U.S. sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian goods, and he argued that Iran, Venezuela and other countries should be able to get anything they need to address the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe goods that are needed for each of these countries to resolve that coronavirus problem in their nations are not sanctioned,\u201d Pompeo said during a State Department briefing Tuesday.\n\nPompeo said the Trump administration has offered humanitarian aid to Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, among other sanctioned countries, but that assistance has been rejected.\n\n\u201cSome of these countries continue to build bombs and missiles and nuclear capability, all the while their people are starving,\u201d he said.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nPompeo: State Department official dies from coronavirus\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that a State Department official has died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWe've had a State Department official pass away as a result of this virus ... one of our team members,\u201d Pompeo said during a briefing Tuesday. \u201cWe now have 3,000 Americans who have been killed. This is tragic.\u201d\n\nA State Department spokesperson later said two locally employed staff members at U.S. embassies in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kinshasa, Congo, have died from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families affected by this tragedy, and thank them for their loved ones' service to the United States,\u201d said the spokesperson, who was not authorized to speak on the record because of State Department policy. \u201cWe do not at this time have any reports of COVID-19-related deaths of American staff within the Department of State's domestic and global workforce.\u201d\n\nThe State Department\u2019s 75,000-workforce \u2013 deployed in more than 200 locations across the globe \u2013 has been deeply affected by the pandemic. In January, the agency began evacuating diplomats from the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, China, the outbreak\u2019s initial epicenter, and authorized departures have continued from other hotspots.\n\n\u201cReally there aren\u2019t any posts that are immune to the spread of coronavirus,\u201d Dr. William Walters, the agency\u2019s deputy chief medical officer for operations, told reporters during a Monday briefing.\n\nWalters said there are about 75 known cases among State Department employees working abroad and about 30 cases among the agency\u2019s U.S.-based workforce.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nRep. Max Rose to deploy for National Guard to help NY coronavirus response\n\nFreshman Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., will deploy Wednesday for the National Guard to help his state's coronavirus efforts.\n\nHe will deploy to Staten Island and serve as an operations officer. Rose, a Purple Heart recipient who served in Afghanistan, said he would be able to leave his post to vote on another coronavirus package if needed. Rose represents Staten Island, New York City's southernmost borough.\n\n\"My activation and deployment is nothing compared to what our city, state, and country has asked of all them. And it\u2019s certainly nothing compared to the other men and women serving in uniform both here at home and overseas,\" Rose said. \"I am just trying to do my duty and my small part.\u201d\n\nNew York has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. and on Monday, a Navy hospital ship arrived in Manhattan's harbor to help treat the thousands who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nPelosi says US needs to institute vote-by-mail\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak will likely require the country to move toward voting by mail in upcoming elections.\n\nPelosi said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" she thought the $2 trillion CARES Act signed into law last week by President Donald Trump should have had more funding for the states to address \"the reality of life that we are going to have to have more vote by mail.\" The final bill allocated $400 million toward helping states vote during the outbreak, while the Democratic version of the legislation included $4 billion for that purpose.\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized the effort to include funding for elections in the bill during a Fox News interview on Monday.\n\n\"The things they had in there were crazy. They had things \u2013 levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\" the president said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\n\"I feel sad that the President doesn't have confidence in his own party,\" Pelosi said Tuesday. She said she did not think vote by mail would negatively affect Republicans' chances to the polls.\n\n- William Cummings\n\nMcConnell: impeachment diverted attention away from coronavirus\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added his name Tuesday to the list of people who blamed the slow response to the coronavirus on President Donald Trump's impeachment.\n\nThe Senate impeachment trial \u2013 which began with the swearing-in of senators on Jan. 16 and ended with Trump's acquittal on Feb. 5 \u2013 \"diverted the attention of the government,\" McConnell told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nTrump critics have described the impeachment argument \u2013 one employed by many Trump supporters in recent weeks \u2013 as an excuse.\n\nTrump, they noted, began taking questions about coronavirus in January and downplayed the threat until late February, well after the trial ended.\n\nTrump supporters like Sean Hannity have long claimed that impeachment diverted the government's attention from issues like the coronavirus.\n\nAlso on the Hewitt show Tuesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said: \"I have to tell you that in mid-January and late-January, unfortunately, Washington, especially the Congress, was consumed with another matter \u2013 you may recall the partisan impeachment of the President.\"\n\nOn Feb. 27, Trump said during a speech at the White House that the virus was \"going to disappear. One day \u2013 it's like a miracle, it will disappear.\" He then said, \"you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens.\"\n\nThree weeks before, the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Trump of House impeachment charges that he abused power and obstructed a congressional investigation into his team's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic political opponent Joe Biden.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nGOP Maryland governor: Trump's testing claims 'not true'\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday on NPR's Morning Edition that President Donald Trump was incorrect in saying coronavirus testing problems had been resolved.\n\n\"Yeah, that's just not true. I mean I know that they've taken some steps to create new tests, but they're not actually produced and distributed out to the states.\" Hogan said, when host Rachel Martin asked him about Trump's assertions. \"No state has enough testing.\"\n\nIn a coronavirus task force briefing yesterday, Trump said America's coronavirus testing was better \"than any country in the world.\"\n\nThe Maryland Republican said he was listening to the \"smart team\" in the White House like Drs. Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci who were giving accurate information.\n\nHogan, who issued a statewide stay-at-home order on Monday, had a grim outlook for states' pandemic preparedness.\n\n\"There's nobody in America that's prepared,\" he said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nPelosi: she and Congress do not take responsibility for slow coronavirus response\n\nIn a Tuesday morning interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Congress do not take responsibility for the country's slow response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the year.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" she said Tuesday on MSNBC in response to a question from co-host Willie Geist about whether she or Congress bore responsibility.\n\nInstead, she said she was \"proud\" of the work Congress did, the \"speed\" with which coronavirus response bills passed, and the \"bipartisanship that was the hallmark of it all.\"\n\n\"We can only go as fast as the signature,\" she said of the White House's support for legislation.\n\nThe House Speaker added that she was \"sad\" there was \"no respect for science\" from the White House in the beginning but President Donald Trump \"will say and do what he does.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nPentagon watchdog to oversee $2 trillion in coronavirus relief funds\n\nGlenn Fine, the inspector general for the Defense Department, was appointed to head the committee that will oversee the largest rescue package in U.S. history.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last week, provides more than $2 trillion to help stave off the economic IMPACTS caused by the COVID-19 outbreak that has now killed more than 3,000 people in the U.S. and nearly 40,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe CARES Act calls for the establishment of a Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to oversee the distribution of the funds approved in the massive stimulus bill, as well as the two previous emergency spending bills that were passed to address the outbreak. Fine will head that nine-person committee composed of inspector generals from other departments.\n\n\"I look forward to working with my fellow Inspectors General on the Committee to provide effective, independent oversight of the funding provided by the pandemic legislation,\" Fine said in a statement on Monday. \"Through our efforts, we will seek to promote transparency and ensure that funds are being used consistently with the law\u2019s mandate to respond to this public health crises.\"\n\n'Much of it was junk\u2019:Trump, Pelosi claim credit for beating back bad ideas in coronavirus stimulus\n\nDuring the contentious debate ahead of the final bill's passage, the establishment of an oversight committee to prevent waste and abuse was insisted upon by congressional Democrats who were particularly concerned that the nearly $500 billion allocated to help large industries could become a corporate \"slush fund.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was pleased with Fine's appointment.\n\n\"The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is critical to holding President Trump and his administration accountable to the letter and spirit of the law,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Glenn Fine has a good reputation as a tough federal prosecutor and former DOJ Inspector General, and must exercise his full oversight authority to ensure that the Trump administration implements the CARES Act as intended.\"\n\n- William Cummings\n\nTrump clashes with CNN's Acosta\n\nPresident Donald Trump's rocky relationship with the news media was on display again Monday, as he bristled at questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak during a White House news conference.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta \u2013 with whom Trump has clashed on several occasions, including a 2018 exchange that led to a failed White House effort to revoke Acosta's press credentials \u2013 asked the president, \"What do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months?\"\n\nAcosta proceeded to quote several of Trump's earlier comments in which he said the outbreak \"was very much under control\" and that \"it will go away\" like a \"miracle.\"\n\n\"It will go away. And we're going to have a great victory,\" Trump told Acosta. He went on to defend the accuracy of the previous comments while simultaneously explaining he said them because, \"I want to keep the country calm. I don't want panic in the country.\"\n\n\"I could cause panic much better than even you. I would make you look like a minor league player,\" Trump told Acosta. \"Instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question.\"\n\nCoronavirus:Justice Department launches inquiry of senators who sold large chunks of stock before coronavirus market slide\n\nTrump later turned his ire on PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor, whom he told the previous day to \"be nice\" and not ask \"threatening questions\" after she asked about his statement that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was requesting more ventilators than needed.\n\nOn Monday, Alcindor asked Trump why the U.S. trailed South Korea in per capita testing for the virus.\n\n\"I know South Korea better than anybody,\" Trump replied. \"You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is?\" he asked, trying to explain that the difference was due to population density. Trump then claimed Seoul's population is 38 million when, according to the city's government, it is actually about 10 million.\n\n\"You should be saying, congratulations to the men and women who have done this job, who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great,\" Trump said to Alcindor. \"And if you don\u2019t say it, I\u2019ll say it. I want to congratulate all of the people, you have done a fantastic job.\"\n\n- William Cummings",
