    "content": "What an amazing and weird moment in political history we \u2019 re living through . We all saw something on Thursday night that , in over 200 years of American existence , no one had ever seen before : a woman accept a major-party nomination for the presidency . That \u2019 s an incredible achievement , attained by the nominee through years of struggle , setbacks , and steady forward motion . The magnitude of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s accomplishment guarantees her a spot in the history books , and those of us who witnessed her make that history won \u2019 t soon forget the impression it left .\nThe weird counterpoint to the Democrats \u2019 elevation of a candidate who represents continued social progress is , of course , the Republicans \u2019 nomination of Donald Trump . The Democratic convention was intended to serve both as a response to the fear and disunity offered by Trumpism , and a push to steal from the Republicans all the themes and campaign messages Trumpism eschews : optimism , patriotism , and a sense of shared purpose . Clinton \u2019 s speech accepting the Democratic Party \u2019 s nomination was the capstone of that effort , serving as a call to unity , offering an outstretched hand to those alienated by Trump , and sketching out an optimistic vision of America \u2019 s future .\nHillary \u2019 s provocations of Trump were relentless . She said he \u201c wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other. \u201d She quipped that \u201c he 's taken the Republican Party a long way : from \u2018 Morning in America \u2019 to \u2018 Midnight in America. \u2019 \u201d Trump \u2019 s megalomaniacal declaration that \u201c I alone can fix it \u201d was slung around his neck as Clinton framed it as fundamentally alien to the American tradition . \u201c He 's forgetting every last one of us , \u201d she said . \u201c Americans do n't say : \u2018 I alone can fix it. \u2019 We say : \u2018 We 'll fix it together. \u2019 \u201d In tackling Trump \u2019 s fitness for the office , Clinton made enthusiastic use of The Zinger . \u201c Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis , \u201d she said . \u201c A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. \u201d The obvious intent behind all this was to goad Trump into responding and validating the attack . ( His surrogates tried responding to the speech in real time , and they faceplanted in characteristic fashion . )\nThe Trump flensing also provided the necessary contrast for Hillary to sketch out her bright-and-happy vision for the country . After ticking off a laundry list of intractable problems \u2013 rising inequality , decreased social mobility , stagnant wages , and persistent gridlock \u2013 Hillary went long on optimism :\nBut just look at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges . We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world . We have the most tolerant and generous young people we 've ever had . We have the most powerful military . The most innovative entrepreneurs . The most enduring values . Freedom and equality , justice and opportunity . We should be so proud that these words are associated with us . That when people hear them , they hear America . So do n't let anyone tell you that our country is weak . We 're not . Do n't let anyone tell you we do n't have what it takes . We do .\nNo one heard anything like that at the Republican convention , and voters didn \u2019 t hear much in the way of sustained optimism from any Republican candidate this cycle . So Hillary grabbed that ball and ran with it , making a direct appeal to voters who \u2019 ve been left cold by the GOP \u2019 s embrace of Trump : \u201c Whatever party you belong to , or if you belong to no party at all , if you share these beliefs , this is your campaign . \u201d\nIt was a bold move on Clinton \u2019 s part , not least because there are a lot of voters who don \u2019 t feel especially optimistic right at this moment for all the reasons Hillary laid out in her speech : stuck wages , limited mobility , and exclusion from economic growth . As an answer to these frustrations , Clinton explicitly acknowledged that the Democrats have been kinda terrible at speaking to those concerns . \u201c Some of you are frustrated , even furious . And you know what ? You 're right , \u201d she said . \u201c Democrats are the party of working people , but we have n't done a good enough job showing that we get what you 're going through , and that we 're going to do something about it . \u201d\nAll told , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s speech to the 2016 Democratic National Convention was a singular moment in American politics . We saw the first female presidential nominee from a major party telling voters that things will be better , and that we can all do better , and that the best way to get there is to reject the allure of a would-be strongman and work together . We saw a woman reach an unprecedented height in American politics and offer herself as the alternative to a candidate who busily plumbs new depths . It was quite a thing to see .",
