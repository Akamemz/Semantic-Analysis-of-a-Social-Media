Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker again in 2014 .\nAt a pair of big-money fundraisers at the homes of two billionaires in San Francisco , Mr. Obama called Mrs. Pelosi a \u201c fearless leader \u201d whose return to power would make it easier for him to achieve priorities such as climate-change legislation and clean-energy programs .\n\u201c I am looking to find areas of common ground with Republicans every single day , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c But having said all that , I know Nancy Pelosi . I \u2019 ve seen her courage . I know that she is willing to do the right thing , even when it \u2019 s not politically popular . And I want her once again as a fully empowered partner for us to be able to move our agenda forward . \u201d\nThe president hadn \u2019 t raised money for House Democrats in person in more than two years . Last year , he devoted all of his fundraising energies to his own re-election , frustrating incumbent lawmakers of his party .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s message this week on behalf of Mrs. Pelosi was noticeably different than his last personal pitch for House Democrats in March 2011 . Back then , the president praised Mrs. Pelosi for helping him to pass his health care law , his economic stimulus plan and the auto bailout during the first two years of his administration , before Republicans won the House in 2010 and deposed her as speaker . This week , Mr. Obama focused instead on Mrs. Pelosi \u2019 s potential to help him deliver his environmental agenda over the final two years of his presidency if Democrats win back the House .\n\u201c I think the most important thing is that when you don \u2019 t have another race to run , all you \u2019 re really thinking about is how do I leave a legacy , not simply for the next president but for the next generation that makes America stronger , \u201d Mr. Obama said Thursday .\nSpeaking of his plans to rebuild the economy for the middle class , the president said , \u201c We can do all this without spending massive amounts of money .
