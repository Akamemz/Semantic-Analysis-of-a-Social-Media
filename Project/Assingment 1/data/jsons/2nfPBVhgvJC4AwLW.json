Or liberal Democrats having to defend their homes with guns in Saint Louis , MO . Or the president hiding in the White House bunker as antifa lays waste to Lafayette Park . Or the mayor of Seattle WA , finally shutting down the CHAZ \u201c summer of love \u201d when the mob came to her house .\nThey \u2019 re all \u201c peaceful protesters \u201d \u2014 until they come near you .\nImagine that instead of being a president , mayor or reporter in the vicinity of mentally unbalanced , historically illiterate , thuggishly violent lunatics \u2026 imagine that you , personally , are the window they want to smash .\nNow you know what it \u2019 s like to be a conservative trying to give a speech on a college campus today . ( Thanks for all the help , guys ! )\nNeither the conservative media nor elected Republicans gave a crap about the left-wing paramilitary force that \u2019 s been mobilizing since Trump \u2019 s election .\nThrough it all , conservatives stuck their heads in the sand and rationalized insane liberal violence . It was the path of least resistance \u2014 and also a smart business move . Cowards could pitch themselves as the \u201c reasonable \u201d ones , then sit back and watch as their more popular conservative competitors were deplatformed , shadow-banned and outright canceled .\nOver and over again , conservatives made excuses for doing nothing . They told themselves :\nIt \u2019 s only Milo \u2014 he \u2019 s shocking , not the kind of nuanced conservative thinker I am .\nIt \u2019 s only Gavin McInnes and his \u201c Proud Boys \u201d \u2014 he \u2019 s funny , whereas I am aggressively humorless , so I \u2019 m safe .\nIt \u2019 s only Heather MacDonald and Charles Murray \u2014 they write about crime rates and I.Q . I steer well clear of any topic that might trigger liberals !\nAnd thus were the most interesting and popular personalities on the right scrubbed from the public square by violent , low-I.Q . criminals . How tiny is the circle of speech and behavior you \u2019 ve permitted yourselves , conservatives ?\nNow , hordes of these cretins have taken control of the streets , and the only pushback is the president cowering in the White House , tweeting \u201c LAW & ORDER ! \u201d Yes , Churchill retreated to a basement , too \u2014 in Whitehall , where he planned a war that saved the world . He didn \u2019 t tweet out \u201c HITLER ! BAD ! \u201d\nFor 3 1/2 years , antifa was never punished for anything it did . To the contrary , they were praised . Private citizens who fought back were defamed as \u201c white supremacists \u201d and imprisoned .\nHundreds of masked antifa traveled interstate to riot at Trump \u2019 s inauguration , breaking windows , assaulting Trump supporters , burning stretch limousines and smashing the windows of SUVs \u2014 including Larry King \u2019 s !\nAs a result , more than 200 of the rioters were placed under \u201c arrest , \u201d ( a police technique in use at the time ) . Prosecutors had mounds of evidence , including video , undercover agents and law enforcement witnesses .\nBut D.C. judges Lynn Leibovitz and Robert E. Morin made sure almost all charges were dropped . Only one rioter , facing 70 years for felony rioting and assault on a cop , served any time in prison . Judge Leibovitz suspended all but four months of his sentence .\nNo congressional push to impeach the antifa-friendly judges , no separate federal prosecutions of the out-of-state rioters , no segments about this outrage on Fox News .\nWhen Yiannopoulos was to speak at Berkeley in February 2017 , 1,500 protesters , including more than 100 antifa , set fires , smashed windows and threw rocks . In reaction to this , Berkeley punished Milo and canceled the speech . ( Not to brag , but 2,000 antifa tried to shut down my Berkeley speech last fall but it went off without a hitch ! This was mostly thanks to the Bay Area Proud Boys . Hahaha , antifa ! )\nThere was only one arrest . Soon , Milo was completely deplatformed and disinvited by the toothless , collaborationist CPAC .\nPresident Trump responded to the Berkeley riots by sending in the National Guard to protect free speech at a public university .

Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view \u2014 NO FEDERAL FUNDS ? \u201d \u2026 and then of course did nothing . Positively Churchillian !\nThat was at least better than Sens . Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio , who praised antifa for raining violence on protesters in Charlottesville , Virginia , in August 2017 .

Oh yes , the tearing down of a Confederate statue .\nIn 2018 , the night before Vice magazine founder McInnes gave a speech at the Metropolitan Republican Club on the Upper East Side , antifa smashed the club \u2019 s historic windows and spray-painted the anarchist \u201c A \u201d on the front door . Sadly for antifa , when they showed up to shut down the event the next day , they were met by McInnes \u2019 Proud Boys \u2014 a multiracial social club for patriotic men who don \u2019 t mind a good scrap .\nThe speech went off , the attendees were protected , and the Proud Boys walked away .

Cyrus Vance Jr. , the same guy who allowed Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein to wantonly rape women and girls in his jurisdiction , year after year .\nTwo Proud Boys are sitting in prison right now , sentenced to four years for fighting back .
