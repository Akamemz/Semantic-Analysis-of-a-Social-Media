Mr. Trump told him \u201c he needed loyalty and expected loyalty , \u201d Mr. Comey recalled .\nMr. Comey said he \u201c did not reply or even nod or change my facial expression , which [ Mr. Trump ] noted because we came back to it later . \u201d\nMr. Trump also disputed the salacious information contained in the so-called \u201c Steele Dossier , \u201d compiled on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee .\n\u201c There were no prostitutes .
