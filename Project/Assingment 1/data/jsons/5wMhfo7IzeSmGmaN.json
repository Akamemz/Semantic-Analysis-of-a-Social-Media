On Thursday , the Russian president reportedly declared Trump to be the `` absolute leader '' of the race .\nPutin -- a natural if brawny showman who has posed fishing shirtless , shooting shirtless and horseback riding shirtless -- also said of Trump : `` He 's a very lively man , talented without doubt . ''\nThus did the man who embodies the parody of homoeroticism from the 1970s endorse one who embodies the parody of a blow-hard executive from the 1980s .

His darkly comical musical `` The Producers '' features the number `` Heil Myself !

One thing the young Putin would have been taught by his employers at the KGB 's First Chief Directorate , the agency 's center for foreign intelligence collection , is to look for character flaws that can be used to enlist a target as an agent or , short of that , an unwitting helper .

Putin has no doubt observed that flattery works well on The Donald : from his tweets to TV appearances to debate performances , Trump is a lion to those who are critical and a lamb to those who suffer his repetitive imprecisions silently .\nPutin 's giddiness over Trump 's personal flaws shifts to outright desire when the candidate starts talking about U.S. policy toward Russia .
