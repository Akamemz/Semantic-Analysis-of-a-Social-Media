You must stop fighting . And enter into dialogue .\n`` Whatever grievances you may have , this is wrong . Why are you continuing to kill people ? There are many other ways to resolve this issue without killing each other . ''\nThe coordinates of the school in Beit Hanoun , which was serving a shelter for families in Gaza , had been given to the Israeli military , said a U.N. spokesman , Chris Gunness .\nFootage from the school showed pools of blood and images from hospitals showed absolute chaos .

''\nThe IDF said it had told people at the school to evacuate because of the fighting in the area and given a four-hour window to get people out . Israeli officials told CNN they had warned U.N. officials for three days to evacuate .\nShortly after the strike , Gunness tweeted that the coordinates of the shelter had been given to the Israeli military and that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency had twice tried to coordinate with the Israeli military to evacuate the civilians at the shelter .\nThe shelter is in an area that has seen intense fighting recently .\nGunness posted : `` Precise co-ordinates of the UNRWA shelter in Beit Hanoun had been formally given to the Israeli army . ... `` Then minutes later , he tweeted : `` Over the course of the day UNRWA tried 2 coodinate with the Israeli Army a window for civilians 2 leave & it was never granted . ...

The second occurred Wednesday in central Gaza at a shelter were about 1,500 were staying .\nNews of Thursday 's hit on the shelter also comes as the Israeli military said the number of airstrikes it was launching had been lowered .\nIsrael Defense Forces said it hit 35 terror targets overnight . A day earlier , the number was 187 .\nThe Israeli military also reported a sharp fall in the number of rockets fired from Gaza early Thursday , although as the day wore on , more rockets were lofted toward Israel , some in the direction of the international airport in Tel Aviv .\nBut the human cost of the conflict remains clear . It can be seen in the blocks of rubble that line Gaza neighborhoods , where the Israeli military has relentlessly bombed . It 's evident in the frayed nerves of Israeli citizens who dive into bomb shelters as Hamas rockets fly in their direction on a daily basis .\nAt least 797 people have been killed and more than 5100 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation on Gaza , said Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra , a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry .

Hamas said Turkey and Kuwait were also involved .\nMeanwhile , Delta Air Lines joined Air Canada and United Airlines in resuming flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv , airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said . It has been a day and a half since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration imposed the prohibition of flights to the city because of security concerns .\nOn Thursday , Lufthansa Group canceled all Lufthansa , Germanwings , Austrian Airlines , Swiss and Brussels Airlines flights flying to and from Tel Aviv through Friday . Lufthansa said in a statement that it `` acknowledges the considerable efforts '' Israel has made to protect the airport using its `` Iron Dome '' -- system that targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in the air .\nWhen Lufthansa is assured that protection can be `` verifiably guaranteed '' it will resume flights .\nPassengers who were booked on canceled flights can rebook free of charge or have their ticket price refunded , the carrier added .\nThe canceling of flights has caused some controversy which continued Thursday with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer asking Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid about it .\nThe FAA 's ban was `` a major setback to Israel , '' Blitzer said .\nYair responded by saying that Los Angeles International Airport was `` ten times '' more dangerous that Ben Gurion International though he acknowledges that a rocket had landed about a mile from the airport .\n`` It 's totally safe to fly to Israel , '' he said , `` and I recommend it by the way to everyone who wants to come in .

The second occurred Wednesday in central Gaza at a shelter were about 1,500 were staying.\n\nNews of Thursday's hit on the shelter also comes as the Israeli military said the number of airstrikes it was launching had been lowered.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces said it hit 35 terror targets overnight. A day earlier, the number was 187.\n\nThe Israeli military also reported a sharp fall in the number of rockets fired from Gaza early Thursday, although as the day wore on, more rockets were lofted toward Israel, some in the direction of the international airport in Tel Aviv.\n\nBut the human cost of the conflict remains clear. It can be seen in the blocks of rubble that line Gaza neighborhoods, where the Israeli military has relentlessly bombed. It's evident in the frayed nerves of Israeli citizens who dive into bomb shelters as Hamas rockets fly in their direction on a daily basis.\n\nAt least 797 people have been killed and more than 5100 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation on Gaza, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry. On Thursday, 107 people were killed, he said.\n\nAn Israeli military representative said Thursday that the violence has killed 32 soldiers and three civilians.\n\nTwo killed at West Bank protest\n\nTwo Palestinian men were shot and killed during a demonstration in the West Bank in support of residents of Gaza, Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti said.\n\nHe said more than 15,000 people were marching when Israeli soldiers fired. More than 100 people were wounded, he said. The health minister in Ramallah said 185 of the wounded were brought there for treatment.\n\nMosques using loudspeakers called for people to donate blood at hospitals, Palestinian television reported.\n\nProtesters were \"throwing rocks, firebombs and fireworks\" at Israeli security forces, the Jerusalem Post reported. The newspaper, which put the size of the demonstration at 10,000 people, said 13 Israeli police officers were injured.\n\nDiplomatic efforts, some flights to Israel resume\n\nKerry was back in Cairo, continuing his shuttle diplomacy to forge a truce a day after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as well Secretary-General Ban.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN crew turned back by gunfire in Gaza Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH U.N. calls for immediate end to violence 02:11\n\n\"Over the last few days, Secretary Kerry has been engaged with the Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Europeans, the U.N., the Arab League, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) to determine how to achieve an end to the current violence and build a process that can create a sustainable path forward,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said.\n\nThe diplomatic effort wasn't solely limited to the United States, as several Middle Eastern nations worked to try to win Hamas' agreement for an Egyptian-led cease-fire. Hamas said Turkey and Kuwait were also involved.\n\nMeanwhile, Delta Air Lines joined Air Canada and United Airlines in resuming flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said. It has been a day and a half since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration imposed the prohibition of flights to the city because of security concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, Lufthansa Group canceled all Lufthansa, Germanwings, Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Brussels Airlines flights flying to and from Tel Aviv through Friday. Lufthansa said in a statement that it \"acknowledges the considerable efforts\" Israel has made to protect the airport using its \"Iron Dome\" -- system that targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in the air.\n\nWhen Lufthansa is assured that protection can be \"verifiably guaranteed\" it will resume flights.\n\nPassengers who were booked on canceled flights can rebook free of charge or have their ticket price refunded, the carrier added.\n\nThe canceling of flights has caused some controversy which continued Thursday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer asking Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid about it.\n\nThe FAA's ban was \"a major setback to Israel,\" Blitzer said.\n\n\"Yes, it was and it was wrong,\" Lapid answered.\n\n\"It was a win for Hamas, right?\" Blitzer said.\n\nYair responded by saying that Los Angeles International Airport was \"ten times\" more dangerous that Ben Gurion International though he acknowledges that a rocket had landed about a mile from the airport.\n\n\"It's totally safe to fly to Israel,\" he said, \"and I recommend it by the way to everyone who wants to come in.\"",
