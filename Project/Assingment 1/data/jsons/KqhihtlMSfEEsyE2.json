But looks can be deceiving because Mark Meadows is a major power player in Washington .\nMeadows leads the Freedom Caucus , a group of more than 30 conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives who can make or break a president 's agenda . Last month , Meadows and his merry men stood firm against GOP leadership and The White House , demanding a better health care bill .\nPresident Donald Trump was n't happy . He tweeted that if Meadows `` would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform . ''\n`` I do n't take his tweets as personal , '' Meadows told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . `` They 're part of the negotiation , part of getting people to move , to get people to a 'yes .

''\nThe narrative on Meadows and the House Freedom Caucus has been that they 're too rigid and demanding .\n`` There 's been talk about us moving the goalposts , '' says Meadows . `` Well , we have .
