    "content": "Michael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine .\nAs we enter 2016 , Americans are still feeling grouchy . Only one-fourth of the public believes the United States is heading in the right direction . The Republican presidential debates have been malaise-a-thons , competitions to portray American decline in the most apocalyptic terms possible , while Bernie Sanders is pursuing the Democratic nomination with a message so depressing that professional curmudgeon Larry David has basically played him straight . A year after I wrote an article only somewhat ironically titled Everything Is Awesome , cable news is an endless Debbie Downer loop of terrorism fears and market jitters , periodically interrupted by a weirdly coifed nativist blowhard promising to Make America Great Again .\nIgnore that guy . Ignore cable , too . America is already great , and it \u2019 s getting greater . Not everything is awesome , but in general , things are even more awesome than they were a year ago . The rest of the world can only wish it had our problems .\nStart with the economy , which , if you listen to Sanders or the Republicans , is a garbage dump of existential despair . Actually , it \u2019 s doing quite well . Unemployment has dropped from 10 percent during the worst of the Great Recession to 5 percent today , thanks to a record 69 consecutive months of private-sector employment growth that has produced 13.7 million new jobs . The past two years have been the best two years for job creation in the 21st century . After a near-death experience during the financial meltdown of 2008 , the U.S. auto industry enjoyed record sales in 2015 . The housing market has also rebounded from the crisis , and after-tax corporate profits are at an all-time high . It can sound partisan to mention those facts when a Democrat is in the White House , but they \u2019 re facts ; it ought to be possible to acknowledge them without necessarily giving President Obama too much credit for them .\nIn any case , the oft-predicted doomsday scenarios of the post-crisis era\u2014double-dip recession , runaway inflation , runaway interest rates , out-of-control energy prices , a health insurance death spiral , a Greek-style debt crisis , a run on the dollar\u2014are still stubbornly refusing to materialize . Growth is modest but steady . Inflation is low . Interest rates are very low , although the Fed felt confident enough about the recovery to raise them last month for the first time since the global financial meltdown . Gas is barely $ 2 a gallon . About 17 million uninsured Americans have gotten coverage in the past few years . The federal deficit has plunged from $ 1.4 trillion in 2009 to under $ 500 billion , while the dollar has gained strength against foreign currencies . That \u2019 s a reflection of the relative strength of the U.S. economy\u2014European unemployment is still in double digits , while Latin America and Asia are reeling\u2014but it \u2019 s also an obstacle to even better growth , making our exports more expensive . In that sense , we \u2019 re victims of our own success , although it \u2019 s way better to be us than them .\nSkeptics often portray the U.S. economy as weaker than the data suggest\u2014because underemployment and long-term unemployment rates are still somewhat high , although they \u2019 re now falling even faster than the regular unemployment rate ; because the \u201c labor participation rate \u201d is actually getting worse , although that 's mostly a result of baby-boomer retirements and increased college attendance ; or because too many of the newly created jobs are part time , which is simply untrue . The most widespread criticism is that wages have been stagnant for decades , a legitimate problem , but wages actually grew 2 percent faster than inflation over the past year .\nMeanwhile , other recent developments\u2014cheaper gas , free birth control and preventive care , the elimination of annual and lifetime caps on health insurance , expanded tax credits for the working poor , increased efficiency measures that lower energy bills , and much more\u2014have put more money in the pockets of American families , even though their incomes have grown slowly . Health care prices have risen at their lowest rate in half a century since the passage of Obamacare , increasing just 1.3 percent over the past year . Tuition costs are still soaring and Americans now hold more than $ 1.2 trillion in student debt , but the Obama administration has quietly changed the rules to let borrowers cut their payments to 10 percent of their discretionary income and get their loans forgiven after 20 years . Savings rates have almost doubled since the crisis , and family debt burdens have dropped to 2002 levels .\nIn non-economic news , despite a year of furor over mass shootings and urban unrest , crime in big cities dropped about 5 percent in 2015 , and has been cut in half since 1990 . The teen birth rate is down more than 60 percent since 1990 , and that \u2019 s not because of increasing abortions , because they \u2019 ve fallen by more than a third . U.S. oil imports are at their lowest level in nearly three decades , while wind generation is up more than threefold and solar generation is up 25-fold since 2008 . Carbon emissions have dropped 10 percent from 2005 levels . High school graduation rates are at an all-time high , with the most striking gains for minorities and the poor . The financial sector is much safer , with much more capital to absorb banking losses , much less of the risky overnight funding that fuels panics , and much broader regulation of Wall Street institutions that once operated in the shadows . And despite all the rhetoric about border crises and wall-building , America \u2019 s population of undocumented immigrants has remained stable for the past five years .\nIn an era of legislative gridlock in Washington , those are pretty cool developments . And guess what ? Legislative gridlock in Washington eased significantly in 2015 . After four years of divided-government paralysis , President Obama signed a slew of major bipartisan laws last year , including a bizarrely responsible reform of a long-standing Medicare funding problem and a sensible overhaul of the unpopular No Child Left Behind education law . Republicans and Democrats also came together to pass some more dubious laws , like a long-term highway bill that will use budget gimmicks to finance America \u2019 s unsustainable addiction to asphalt . The point is , for better or for worse , Congress is doing stuff again .\nGlass-half-empty types , especially Republican glass-half-empty types , argue that none of this really matters when Americans don \u2019 t feel safe from jihadists . And yes , the attack in San Bernardino was horrible . But only 45 Americans have been killed by jihadists since 2001 , fewer than the death count from lightning or toddlers with guns or just about any disease you can imagine . If Americans are freaking out anyway , well , maybe they shouldn \u2019 t . And incidentally , American soldiers are dramatically safer now that so many of them have come home from war zones . Last year , only eight were killed in Iraq and 27 in Afghanistan , after more than 8,000 casualties in the previous 12 years .\nIn general , this is an exciting time to be a human being . We \u2019 re living longer . There \u2019 s less war , less infant mortality , less abject poverty .
