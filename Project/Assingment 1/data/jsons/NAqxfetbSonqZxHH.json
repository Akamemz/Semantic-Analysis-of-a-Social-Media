But the Democratic presidential nominee , speaking on her economic agenda Thursday in Michigan , clearly channeled her vanquished rival as she pushed for policies to help working Americans , promote \u201c fairness \u201d in taxation , and address inequality .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s pitch to the middle class aimed to contrast with the agenda unveiled in Detroit on Monday by Donald Trump , a plan , she said \u2013 using Sanders-esque language \u2013 that `` would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations , millionaires , and Wall Street money managers . ''\nClinton also coined a new term : the \u201c Trump loophole , \u201d referring to his proposed changes to the tax code that she said would allow the businessman-turned-politician to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies .\nAnd Clinton repeated her vow to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , a free-trade arrangement among Pacific Rim nations , including the United States , that she supported as secretary of State and is still backed by President Obama . Many Americans blame international trade for stagnant wages and the long-term decline in American manufacturing .\n\u201c I oppose it now , I \u2019 ll oppose it after the election , and I \u2019 ll oppose it as president , \u201d Clinton said .\nIn reinforcing her recent leftward shift , Clinton seemed to be trying to energize the significant segment of the Democratic electorate that backed Senator Sanders in the primaries . Polls show Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters largely unified behind her \u2013 certainly more so than Republicans around Trump \u2013 but it \u2019 s unclear how motivated they are .\nThen there \u2019 s the challenge of attracting Republicans who reject Trump and who may be available to Clinton if she doesn \u2019 t go too far to the left . It is a needle she has three months to thread .\nBut energizing , or even holding on to , young Sanders supporters could also be challenging . Among young Sanders supporters , \u201c much of that backing [ for Clinton ] is grudging , with turnout an open question and support for third-party candidates posing a potential risk to Clinton , \u201d writes Sofi Sinozich of ABC News , which released a poll on young voters Thursday .\nOn TPP , \u201c I think she \u2019 s feeling the pressure on that \u201d because of the Sanders campaign , says Dean Baker , co-founder of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington . \u201c This is a much stronger statement .
