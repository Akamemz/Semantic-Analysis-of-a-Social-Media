Obama picks Tom Perez for Labor\n\nPresident Barack Obama called Tom Perez a man \u201cwho reminds us of this country\u2019s promise\u201d as he nominated him to be his next labor secretary Monday.\n\nPerez, 51, is the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division.
