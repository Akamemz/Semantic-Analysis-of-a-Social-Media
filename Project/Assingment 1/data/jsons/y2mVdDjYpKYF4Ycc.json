That is putting it mildly . The express-delivery giant announced that it was slashing its delivery capacity and , for the first time ever , refused to give earnings guidance . While economists debate whether this recession will be short-lived or sustained ( see Briefing ) , bosses the world over already see mayhem . The virus has destroyed $ 23trn in global market value since mid-February .\nAs governments curb citizens \u2019 activities\u2014including much of commerce\u2014in an effort to save lives , the ranks of corporate casualties are swelling . Fewer people are taking planes ( see article ) , hailing rides , eating out , staying in hotels , going to cinemas or gathering just about anywhere . Most American and European sports leagues have been suspended . Formula 1 motor-racing has ground to a standstill . Apple and Nike have closed most of their stores outside of China . Carmakers including Ford , Toyota and Volkswagen are shutting factories in Europe and America .\nThe bloodletting will continue . Scott Stringer , New York \u2019 s finance chief , predicts that the city \u2019 s hotels will be two-thirds empty until the end of June . Its restaurants and bars , ordered shut , could see sales drop by 80 % . The American Hotel and Lodging Association fears a blow exceeding the impact of September 11th 2001 and the \u201c Great Recession \u201d of 2008 combined . Morgan Stanley , a bank , reckons retail foot traffic may plunge by 60 % in coming weeks , as more American cities follow many European ones into lockdown .\nMany companies will pull through . Governments are rushing in to ensure as many as possible do . Britain this week unveiled a \u00a3330bn ( $ 382bn ) package of loan guarantees and other support for businesses . America \u2019 s Federal Reserve earlier said it would create a new funding facility to provide liquidity to American issuers of commercial paper . President Donald Trump has called for $ 1trn in economic stimulus .\nEven so , some firms will not make it . It is too early to say for sure who the corporate fatalities will be . To get a sense of which are most at risk , liquidity and business model are a good place to start .\nTake liquidity first . American firms account for 55 % of global non-financial debt maturing until the end of 2024 , and 62 % of debt rated junk , according to S & P Global , a rating agency . Non-financial firms in America will see $ 394bn in investment-grade debt and $ 87bn in junk debt fall due this year ; the figures for next year are $ 461bn and $ 195bn . Potential trouble spots include construction ( with nearly $ 30bn in junk debt due by the end of 2021 ) , media and entertainment ( $ 35bn ) , and energy and utilities ( $ 56bn ) .\nOil companies in particular have been clobbered by the steep fall in the price of crude , which sank to $ 25 a barrel on March 18th , the lowest level in nearly two decades . Morgan Stanley calculates that the median exploration and production firm needs an oil price of $ 51 a barrel to break even . Saudi Aramco , the world \u2019 s mightiest oil colossus , said it might cut capital spending by up to a quarter this year . America \u2019 s ExxonMobil echoed that it will make \u201c significant \u201d cuts .\nOilmen are not the only ones trying to preserve cash . Many companies are sending workers on leave or worse . Norwegian Air Shuttle , an airline , is temporarily laying off 90 % of its 10,000 employees . Marriott International , the world \u2019 s largest hotel chain , said on March 17th that it will have to let go of tens of thousands of workers .\nCompanies are rushing to tap credit lines secured with their bankers . AB InBev , the world \u2019 s biggest brewer , is drawing down its $ 9bn revolving credit . Boeing , a troubled aerospace giant , has accessed $ 13.8bn . Carnival Cruise Line hopes to stay afloat thanks to a $ 3bn lifeline . Bloomberg , a financial-data firm , reckons that if firms in five big sectors ( health care , energy , transport , leisure and mining ) drew down 70 % of their credit lines , and the rest tapped 30 % of theirs , America \u2019 s biggest banks would be on the hook for $ 700bn .\nCompanies \u2019 second vulnerability besides a liquidity crunch arises from their business models . Some tried and tested ones suddenly look rather fragile in the age of pandemic . If Apple does not sell a new iPhone it may still convince consumers to buy one later . Revenues from a restaurant meal not eaten or a forgone trip to the cinema are lost for ever .\nThat is bad news for industries like the arts , which depend on a few big , one-off events\u2014at least in countries like Britain , where state-funding of the arts is less lavish than in France , Germany or Gulf sheikhdoms . Art Basel Hong Kong was cancelled last month . The main Art Basel fair in Switzerland , which is due to open on June 18th , may also not go ahead . Galleries that depend on such fairs , as many do , could see as much as 80 % of their sales evaporate .\nNo surprise , then , that the coronavirus is provoking some soul-searching , especially in conservative industries . On March 20th Art Basel Hong Kong will launch online \u201c viewing rooms \u201d with more than 231 galleries\u2014over 90 % of the original exhibitor line-up .
