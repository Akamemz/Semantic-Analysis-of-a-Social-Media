    "content": "Bill Weld , the former Massachusetts governor and 2016 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee , is facing some brutal odds this Super Tuesday in his Quixotic quest to wrest the GOP presidential nomination from incumbent Donald Trump .\nWeld , who lost to Trump by nearly 96 percentage points in Iowa and nearly 77 in New Hampshire , then watched helplessly as Nevada and South Carolina ceded all delegates to the president rather than hold elections , has not as an official candidate polled higher than 14 percent in any of the 13 states ( worth a combined 785 delegates ) voting Tuesday . Trump 's margin in national polls has not dipped below 80 percentage points since October , and his approval rating among Republicans rests at 93 percent . The president 's combined campaign-finance juggernaut is outraising Weld by a ratio of 300 to 1 .\nAnd yet the perpetually chipper redhead still sees some upside to his long shot bid . More than half of Super Tuesday states , including Trump-averse Utah , have not been polled . In his home state of Massachusetts , Weld was endorsed by the Boston Globe , in an effort `` to salvage time-honored conservative principles and to change the shabby tone of the Trump era . ''\nAnd though he no longer dreams of being 1992 Pat Buchanan or 1968 Eugene McCarthy , Robert Mueller 's old boss does hold out hope that his minor electoral contribution might yet be enough to derail the 2020 Trump train .\n`` Steve Bannon said that if the president loses four percent of the traditional Republican vote , he can not be re-elected , '' Weld told me in a phone interview Monday afternoon . `` If that 's true , that 's a marker I can meet . And it would not pain me to think that I had some responsibility for bringing it about that Donald J. Trump was not re-elected president . ''\nWeld , who has campaigned consistently on reducing debt/deficits , updating 1990s-flavored moderate-conservative reform for the 21st century , and railing against Trump 's unfitness , also told me that he still thinks the Republican Party might go the way of the Whigs , and that a `` strong third party '' including `` centrist Democrats '' and `` centrist libertarians '' might rise from the ashes in 2021 or 2022 . He also said he would back Joe Biden or Michael Bloomberg if they became the Democratic presidential nominee , though not Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I\u2013Vt . ) at this time .\nThe following is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation :\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : What results do you need to see tomorrow to stick in until Wednesday ?\nWeld : Well , I 'll be sticking in anyway . I mean , we 've got Michigan coming up on the 10th . We 've got Florida coming up on the 17th . So I do n't want to miss those .\nIn terms of tonight , I would say my top three states are probably Vermont , Massachusetts , and Utah . I 've been endorsed by Evan McMullin , who got 20 percent-plus in Utah last time . Had some very nice visits out there with the [ Latter Day Saints ] folks , who I get along with very well . So that 's why that 's in the top three . [ \u2026 ]\nColorado is an open primary , and I think unpredictable\u2014I 'm not predicting victory there , but that could be an interesting state . California , likewise , not predicting victory , because it 's a closed primary , but Trump has really declared open war on California , so that could be of interest . Otherwise , I 'd like to see what happens in Texas and North Carolina , Tennessee . It should be an enjoyable evening .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : What have you learned in this process since you jumped in ?\nWeld : I 've learned that the duopoly in Washington , D.C. , is every bit as bad as Gary Johnson and I thought it was four years ago . It 's really paralyzing the country and preventing forward motion . When you have a president of the United States who shares that poisonous view and is vengeful into the bargain , that makes it even worse . So that 's what I 've learned !\nIt 's all about Washington , D.C. , the bad stuff\u2014it 's not about the state capitals and states , it 's not about the Trump voters . I think it 's about Donald Trump , the increased negativity .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : What have you observed on a state-by-state level , including even in Massachusetts to the extent that it 's relevant , about the way that Trump and the national GOP has muscled in on state GOPs , or that just state GOPs know that in order to be popular you need to stay in good with the president ?\nWeld : Well , no , it 's not that they 're inferring anything , it 's that they 're told things . Because once the Republican National Committee merged its operations with the Trump campaign , then from that point forward the Republican state committee in every single state was , is , and remains the Trump organization . So it does n't pay me to try to bark up that tree .\nMy strategy needs to be , and has been , to try to increase the number of people voting in the Republican primary\u2014more women , more younger voters , more minorities , et cetera , et cetera . Just voters who are perhaps marginally more likely to rally to my flag than a classical Republican voter who 's voted in the last five Republican primaries .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : You mentioned that the duopoly is every bit as strong , if not stronger . And yet we 're on the verge of having Trump , who was an outsider , take over the Republican Party and mold it in his image , largely . And Bernie Sanders is on the verge of being a democratic socialist independent who might do the same with the Democratic Party . What do you make of that paradox ? So , the duopoly is super strong and yet vulnerable to takeover by kind of anti-establishment figures ?\nWeld : Well , I 'm not sure Sanders is going to get there , frankly . Most people seem to think that he will .\nI think Donald Trump essentially cemented his takeover of what I 'll call the Trump faction of the Republican Party\u2026when 52 Republican senators not only said , `` We do n't want to hear any evidence , '' they also said , `` We really do n't want to consider whether you should be removed from office , although the Constitution requires us to do so . '' That was not a good showing .\nAnd I know that a number of them have said to the press on background since their vote , `` I did it because of fear . I did it because I was fearful the president would run somebody against me to my right in the primary , and I would lose my seat . '' I 'll tell you , if that was the case with me , I would never have admitted that to anybody on or off the record ! That 's a shameful admission .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : You and I talked a lot in 2017 and 2018 when you were still doing a lot of activities within the Libertarian Party ; you had an analysis of the Republican Party facing a future in which maybe they go the way of the Whigs , maybe they kind of split apart and get reborn anew into something else , or explode . I want you to re-evaluate that analysis . And then also , might that be happening on the Democratic side as well ?\nWeld : Well , victory is a wonderful salve . And if the Democrats win the election , I do n't think that 'll happen , Democratic side .\nOn our side , yeah , no , I think the same thing I did last time . And this time , because of their votes to acquit without hearing any evidence , I think the Republican senators are vulnerable this year .\nI saw this happen with the Nixon impeachment when people who had gone through the draining exercise of defending President [ Richard ] Nixon all summer long and saying , `` There 's insufficient evidence that he knew about the Watergate conspiracy to tank the Jaworski investigation '' \u2014they lost their seats . Including people like Rep. Wiley Mayne from Iowa , who had won handsomely [ before ] but was voted out . I mean , they looked kind of ridiculous .\nI 'm not sure that a number of the Republican senators this time around do n't look ridiculous . So I think there 's a decent chance that the Republicans will lose the Senate .\nThen you could see some finger-pointing and forces at play that could cause a split-up of the party , similar to the split-up of the Whigs in the 1850s with the Know-Nothing faction , which was founded on anti-immigrant prejudice . It was all the Catholics from Germany and Italy and Ireland that they hated , and they had violent rallies and they had conspiracy theories . It 's a carbon copy of the Trump faction now . But they did pinwheel out into outer space and were never heard from again . Except for Speaker Nathaniel Banks of the Massachusetts House , who also became speaker of the U.S. House , I think . But he was an outlier . So I think that could happen again , and I 'm not sure it 'd be a bad thing .\nYou might see a third party\u2014a strong third party , not a single-issue third party\u2014emerge out of the remnants of traditional Republicans . Some centrist Democrats , some centrist libertarians . That could be an interesting party . I 'll just call it the Unity Party for the time being . That 's something that could happen . But it 's not going to happen in 2020 . It would be 2021 , 2022 .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : It 's not hard to look at your situation and see some pretty bad math\u2026So what are some glass-half-full analyses of the numbers going into tomorrow , even if there are some lopsided defeats ?\nWeld : Well , although you 'd always like to win any contest you get into , and I 'm no stranger to long odds\u2014my first governor 's race , I won , even though I started at sub-asterisk levels and everyone laughed and said , `` You got to get out of this race '' \u2014however , I do think that of the reasons that I 'm running , number one is I think I could start Monday on the job , and I have half a dozen things that I think desperately need doing . But number two is\u2014and the \u2588\u2588\u2588 I ran as a Republican this time as opposed to a Libertarian\u2014one of the reasons is that every vote for me , even a write-in vote for me , is not a vote for Trump .\nSteve Bannon said that if the president loses 4 percent of the traditional Republican vote , he can not be re-elected . I do n't know whether Bannon was being serious or not , but he 's usually serious . And if that 's true , that 's a marker I can meet . And it would not pain me to think that I had some responsibility for bringing it about that Donald J. Trump was not re-elected president .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : I know you do n't spend a lot of time commenting on the Democratic race , for obvious reasons , but is it safe to assume that if it 's candidate Biden or Bloomberg , you would vote or encourage people to vote Democrat ? And if it 's candidate Sanders , you 're going to wait and see who the Libertarians nominate ?",
