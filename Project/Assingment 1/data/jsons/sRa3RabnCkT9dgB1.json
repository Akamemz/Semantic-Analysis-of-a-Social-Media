    "content": "Molly K. McKew is an expert on information warfare and the narrative architect at New Media Frontier . She advised Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili \u2019 s government from 2009-13 , and former Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat in 2014-15 .\nOn Tuesday morning\u2014the day after the House Intelligence Committee voted along partisan lines to send Rep. Devin Nunes \u2019 memo , alleging abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , to President Donald Trump for declassification\u2014presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway was confronted with the idea that Russian trolls were promoting the # releasethememo hashtag online . She was offended . Russian trolls , she told a television interviewer , \u201c have nothing to do with releasing the memo\u2014that was a vote of the intelligence committee. \u201d But her assertion is incorrect . The vote marked the culmination of a targeted , 11-day information operation that was amplified by computational propaganda techniques and aimed to change both public perceptions and the behavior of American lawmakers .\nAnd it worked . By the time the memo got to the president , its release was a forgone conclusion\u2014even before he had read it .\nThis bears repeating : Computational propaganda\u2014defined as \u201c the use of information and communication technologies to manipulate perceptions , affect cognition , and influence behavior \u201d \u2014has been used , successfully , to manipulate the perceptions of the American public and the actions of elected officials .\nThe analysis below , conducted by our team from the social media intelligence group New Media Frontier , shows that the # releasethememo campaign was fueled by , and likely originated from , computational propaganda . It is critical that we understand how this was done and what it means for the future of American democracy .\nIn the space of a few hours on January 18 , # releasethememo exploded on Twitter , evolving over the next few days from being a marker for discussion on Nunes \u2019 memo through multiple iterations of an expanding conspiracy theory about missing FBI text messages and imaginary secret societies plotting internal coups against the president . # releasethememo provided an organizational framework for this comprehensive conspiracy theory , which , in its underpinnings , is meant to minimize and muddle concerns about Russian interference in American politics .\nThe rapid appearance and amplification of this messaging campaign , flagged by the German Marshall Fund \u2019 s Hamilton68 dashboard as being promoted by accounts previously linked to Russian disinformation efforts , sparked the leading Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to write a letter to Twitter and Facebook asking for information on whether or not this campaign was driven by Russian accounts . Another report , sourced to analysis said to be from Twitter itself , identified the hashtag as an \u201c organic \u201d \u201c American \u201d campaign linked to \u201c Republican \u201d accounts . Promoters of # releasethememo rapidly began mocking the idea that they are Russian bots . ( There are even entirely new accounts set up to tweet that they are not Russian bots promoting # releasethememo , even though their only content is about releasing the supposed memo . )\nBut this back and forth masks the real point . Whether it is Republican or Russian or \u201c Macedonian teenagers \u201d \u2014it does n't really matter . It is computational propaganda\u2014meaning artificially amplified and targeted for a specific purpose\u2014and it dominated political discussions in the United States for days . The # releasethememo campaign came out of nowhere . Its movement from social media to fringe/far-right media to mainstream media so swift that both the speed and the story itself became impossible to ignore . The frenzy of activity spurred lawmakers and the White House to release the Nunes memo , which critics say is a purposeful misrepresentation of classified intelligence meant to discredit the Russia probe and protect the president .\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine \u2019 s email of the week \u2019 s best , delivered to your inbox every Friday morning .

You can unsubscribe at any time .\nAnd this , ultimately , is what everyone has been missing in the past 14 months about the use of social media to spread disinformation . Information and psychological operations being conducted on social media\u2014often mischaracterized by the dismissive label \u201c fake news \u201d \u2014are not just about information , but about changing behavior . And they can be surprisingly effective .\nOn the afternoon of January 18 , a group of congressmen started tweeting about the Nunes FISA abuse memo . At 3:47 p.m. , Rep. Matt Gaetz ( R-Fla. ) went on FoxBusiness and gave an interview about the supposed memo . None of them , to this point , were talking about # releasethememo\u2014the hashtag , that is .\nThe hashtag originated with Twitter user @ underthemoraine at 3:52 p.m. on January 18 . The tweet tags the president , @ realDonaldTrump . The account for @ underthemoraine , most recently named \u201c Lois Lerner Testimony \u201d and whose bio references the Lerner testimony and # MAGA , is currently marked as restricted by Twitter for \u201c unusual activity . \u201d\nJudging from weather reports that are occasionally posted , pictures of the woods , and tweets to friends , @ underthemoraine appears to be a real guy in Michigan , a battleground state ( we believe we have confirmed his real name/identity , but will not use it since he does not ) . He has a history of tweeting about trending conservative media topics\u2014Antifa , # BlueLivesMatter , boycotting the NFL , social media filtering out conservative views , the climate change `` hoax , '' special counsel Robert Mueller . He engages with far-right media\u2014Breitbart , InfoWars , Alex Jones , Drudge\u2014and occasionally posts on astronomy and UFOs . Moraine has few followers ( 74 at last count ) and is not particularly influential . However , his account is followed by several accounts that are probable bots as well as by the verified account of the Michigan Republican Party ( @ MIGOP , which first used # releasethememo at 5:41 a.m. on January 19 ) , an account that likely auto-follows other accounts that engage with it .\nAt 4 p.m. , one of Moraine \u2019 s followers , @ KARYN19138585\u2014an account that has the 8-digit fingerprint associated with some Russian bot accounts\u2014responds to @ underthemoraine \u2019 s tweet , saying Moraine is the first one tweeting about this breaking news topic .\nThe KARYN account is an interesting example of how bots lay a groundwork of information architecture within social media . It was registered in 2012 , tweeting only a handful of times between July 2012 and November 2013 ( mostly against President Barack Obama and in favor of the GOP ) . Then the account goes dormant until June 2016\u2014the period that was identified by former FBI Director James Comey as the beginning of the most intense phase of Russian operations to interfere in the U.S. elections . The frequency of tweets builds from a few a week to a few a day . By October 11 , there are dozens of posts a day , including YouTube videos , tweets to political officials and influencers and media personalities , and lots of replies to posts by the Trump team and related journalists . The content is almost entirely political , occasionally mentioning Florida , another battleground state , and sometimes posting what appear to be personal photos ( which , if checked , come from many different phones and sources and appear \u201c borrowed \u201d ) . In October 2016 , KARYN is tweeting a lot about Muslims/radical Islam attacking democracy and America ; how Bill Clinton had lots of affairs ; alleged financial wrongdoing on Clinton \u2019 s part ; and , of course , WikiLeaks .\nAll of these topics were promoted by Russian disinformation campaigns . There is little content promoting Trump ; it is almost entirely attacking Clinton . On November 1 , for example , KARYN posted a YouTube video showing \u201c the video Hillary Clinton doesn \u2019 t want you to see \u201d \u2014 \u201c documenting \u201d alleged health concerns ( it got almost half a million views on YouTube ) . After November 9 , the day after the election , KARYN \u2019 s tweet volume drops back to a couple a day . Since the revival of the account , there are more than 32,000 tweets and replies\u2014about 66 tweets per day , plus a similar amount of likes . Based on this pattern and and the digital forensics , it \u2019 s clear KARYN is a bot\u2014a bot that follows a random Republican guy in Michigan with 70-some followers . Why ?\nBots both gather and disseminate information\u2014the \u201c gathering \u201d part is important , and rarely discussed . So , let \u2019 s say KARYN was created , abandoned ( as many fake accounts often are ) , and then reactivated and \u201c slaved \u201d to an effort to smear Clinton online . Why would a bot account follow some nobody in Michigan ? It would be fair to say that if you were setting up accounts to track views representative of a Trump-supporter , @ underthemoraine would be a pulse to keep a finger on\u2014the virtual Michigan \u201c man in the diner \u201d or \u201c taxi driver \u201d that journalists are forever citing as proof of conversations with real , nonpolitical humans in swing states . KARYN follows hundreds of such accounts , plus conservative media , and a lot of other bots .\nBack to the afternoon of January 18 : KARYN retweets Moraine \u2019 s post , becoming the third account to use the hashtag ; around this time , automation networks\u2014groups of accounts that automatically retweet , reply to or repost identical content , sometimes using software platforms and sometimes using lists\u2014start weighing in on the hashtag .\nThe second account to tweet # releasethememo is @ well_in_usa\u2014an account opened in July 2014 , now largely deleted . The account , which in 2016 was tweeting a steady stream of anti-Clinton , pro-Trump content , weighing in on topics like \u201c Clinton enabling sexual predators \u201d and # ArrestSoros , has been deleting its tweets since people started watching # releasethememo ( as of January 25 , everything after December 19 , 2017 , was deleted ; as of January 29 , only a handful of replies from 2017 remained ; on February 2 , retweeted content from 2016 is visible again ) \u2014but we have some of them from an archived version .\nIn addition to tweeting # releasethememo to @ realdonaldtrump , Well tags @ RepMattGaetz and @ LizClaman of Fox News , quote-tweeting a post on the Nunes memo from the fanatically pro-Trump media personality Bill Mitchell . This was , primarily , what the Well account did\u2014retweet and reply to accounts with hashtags included , marking them into messaging campaigns . Well is engaging and directing traffic to a specific group of accounts on specific discussions . These accounts often have short shelf lives , appearing as needed and disappearing when their usefulness has passed ( or once flagged by Twitter ) .\nThe fourth account to enter this mix is \u201c Queen Covfefe \u201d @ clasimpmv , which tweeted # releasethememo at 4 p.m. and also retweeted the original Moraine tweet around 6:18 p.m . Though we have confirmed her identity , we will not use it here , as she does not . The twitter ID is the same as an email listed on a linked-in account for a woman in South Carolina , an early primary state , who is a nutritionist and hemp-oil promoter . The profile photo was changed from an anonymous meme to a picture of the woman with Trump at a political rally after she was accused of being a bot for promoting the hashtag . A woman with the same name was recently interviewed by a German newspaper for a profile on Trump supporters . So , this seems to be the account of a real person voluntarily and quite deliberately participating in the effort to amplify the reach of # releasethememo .\nIn the 24 months since the account was established , Queen has tweeted 47,000 times\u2014about 65 times per day , so about the same rate as the active bot . She has tweeted # releasethememo hundreds of times in a few days . She often retweets lists of other twitter handles ( sometimes hundreds of names per list ) \u2014 \u201c people \u201d that you are supposed to follow and retweet to build your own following and influence . They are often labeled with \u201c Follow/retweet/comment for a follow back ! \u201d Two such lists , for example , were retweeted by Queen on January 19 and February 2 . Each list includes at least a few bots . Some bots are amplifiers\u2014in the simplest form , they automatically follow accounts that follow them , and retweet tweets from those accounts ( sometimes , other parameters such as keywords are factored in ) . It is an element of automation . The rest is about network , echo chamber , fake influence and amplification .\nPopping up a little further down the line , around 6 p.m. , is \u201c Stonewall Jackson \u201d @ 1776Stonewall , an anonymous account of a supposed \u201c American history buff \u201d who has around 50,000 followers , far more than early accounts that had been engaging in # releasethememo . It was launched in November 2016 ( tweeting around 57 times/day ) , and some personal-seeming tweets reference New York . It is a \u201c follow-back \u201d account , so partially automated and positioned within an amplification network ; it is followed by and follows many likely Russian bots , plus accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers that automatically retweet Stonewall \u2019 s content . It tweets once or twice a day about history\u2014baseball , the Cold War , the Civil War , astronauts , The Dukes of Hazzard , etc.\u2014but primarily , it is far-right U.S. political content .\nFor the first few hours , only fringe accounts promote # releasethememo . But accounts like Queen ( who had just under 5,000 followers ) and Stonewall begin to retweet each other and push the hashtag to their followers with explicit instructions to \u201c make it trend . \u201d\nThese accounts are organizers and amplifiers . Technically , they both probably qualify as \u201c cyborgs \u201d \u2014accounts with \u201c human conductors \u201d that are partly automated and linked to networks that automatically amplify content .\nBut in Queen \u2019 s case , she is something interesting : essentially , a willing human bot . The organization of conservative accounts like these using \u201c Twitter rooms \u201d to coordinate their efforts was previously reported on by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Her account automatically reposts hashtags and memes and contributes to campaigns that she and the other promoters understand are purposeful attempts to game the algorithms and \u201c make things trend. \u201d She and others simultaneously understand who needs to be targeted with this information\u2014in this case , the president , right-influencers and specific members of Congress . She may be a real person with real beliefs in Trump and what he represents , but when she tweets hundreds of times over the course of a week using # releasethememo , while artificially enhancing her followers ( using the \u201c follow-back \u201d lists , etc . ) and exhorting others to amplify the hashtag , she is just as much an element of computational propaganda against the American public as a Russian bot .\nUse any basic analytical software to scroll through the early promoters of # releasethememo , and you \u2019 ll see most of the accounts meet basic criteria for bot/troll/cyborg suspicion\u2014what the Atlantic Council \u2019 s open-source intelligence research group DFRLab describes as \u201c activity , amplification , and anonymity. \u201d There is also a consistent theme in the list of identities\u2014the repetition of certain words ( deplorable , Texas , mom , veteran ) and certain first names ; use of an American flag emoji at the end of the name ; specific numbers or patterns of numerical sequences associated with bots ; names changed to hashtags , or frequently shifted between trending right-media topics ( Benghazi , NFL boycott , the memo , the emails ) ; photos that aren \u2019 t faces , or not unobscured faces , or certainly not of them if they are .\nThere is little chance an organic or incidental community , even of friends or acquaintances , would look this way online so holistically , tweeting together in such tight intervals . Several of the accounts involved in the initial promotion of this hashtag have subsequently been restricted or suspended by Twitter . Online data analysts said many accounts used to promote the hashtag were recently created , with more being created and disappearing after the hashtag appeared . Thousands still had the default profile photos . CNN \u2019 s analysis found that hundreds of accounts created after the hashtag first appeared were fueling the viral trend .\nCross-reference this analysis and inputs from things like the Hamilton68 dashboard , and you can see # releasethememo is carried forward by automated accounts overnight after it begins to trend . It continued to do so from its appearance until the memo was released . The volume and noise matter\u2014and so does the targeting .\nA key function of the accounts discussed above is that they tweet at key influencers with these messaging campaigns\u2014media personalities , far-right brand names , and elected officials who might pick up the info or hashtag and legitimize it by repeating it . The accounts tweeting # releasethememo immediately began to target the president ( not an unusual occurrence ) , but also the Trumpiest of congressmen\u2014Republicans Steve King of Iowa , Gaetz , Lee Zeldin of New York , Trey Gowdy of South Carolina , Mark Meadows of North Carolina , Jim Jordan of Ohio , etc.\u2014as well as alt- and far-right influencers and media personalities . A few active verified accounts , including @ KamVTV\u2014an account that often appears as the first verified amplifier of bot and far-right content\u2014and @ scottpresler , picked up the hashtag , and others retweeted tweets sent to them from sketchy accounts . ( @ saracarterDC of Fox News , for example , RTed an account that is a month old and has already tweeted 1,200 times , including posting content from ( other ) bots and fake profiles . )\nThis is a basic social media information operation : Any one of these targets could see the hashtag in their mentions , replies and quoted-tweets . That \u2019 s the goal of the coordination and amplification , at least some of which is automated\u2014and the purpose of which is to game the algorithms and \u201c trend \u201d a topic .\nThe hashtag # releasethememo wasn \u2019 t the only attempt to dominate online discussion . Before being targeted by amplification campaigns , there were other hashtags being put around by conservative social media mobilizers that either didn \u2019 t take off\u2014 # FISAgate , # FISAmemo , # releasethedocument , # releasethefile\u2014and others that were previously used as catch-alls for conspiracies\u2014 # DeepState , # Transparency , etc . For example , Zeldin tweeted at 4:27 p.m. on January 18 that he had just read the FISA memo and called for its public release .\nHe used the hashtag # transparency . In the 4 hours after that tweet , there were more than 500 tweets targeting him with the hashtag # releasethememo . At 8:28 p.m. , Zeldin tweeted # releasethememo from his verified congressional account .\nVerified alt- or far-right personalities\u2014 @ gatewaypundit , @ jacobawohl , @ scottpresler , among others\u2014began using the hashtag , in particular tagging Gaetz . At 9:53 p.m. , WikiLeaks tweeted # releasethememo . Before midnight , King , Meadows and Gaetz had all tweeted # releasethememo ; so had Laura Ingraham , a massively influential conservative media personality with 2 million followers . Each time an influential verified account used the hashtag , it was rapidly promoted by a vast network of accounts . From its appearance until midnight , # releasethememo was used more than 670,000 times .\nBy midnight , the hashtag was being used 250,000 times per hour . At 2:53 a.m. on January 19 , the pro-Trump conservative personality Bill Mitchell was posting an article from Breitbart about how # releasethememo was trending online . The hashtag had become the organizing framework for multiple stories and lanes of activity , focusing them into one column , which got a big boost from right-stream media and twitter personalities .\nSome , like Breitbart , would argue this volume is representative of the outpouring of grass-roots support for the topic . But compare this time period to other recent significant events . During a similar duration of time covering the Women \u2019 s March on January 20\u2014when more than a million marchers were estimated to be involved in demonstrations across the country\u2014there was a total volume of about 606,000 tweets using the # womensmarch2018 hashtag during its peak ( being used at a pace of 87,000 times per hour ) . During the NFL playoff game the next day ( # jaxvsNE ) , there was a volume of 253,000 tweets , with a top speed of about 75,000 tweets/hour .\nThe pace and scale of the appearance and amplification of # releasethememo is barely even comparable . This is because the hashtag benefited from computational promotion already built into the system . It was used to target lawmakers who would play a role in releasing the memo\u2014lawmakers who argued that there was public pressure to release the memo . Up until the time of the vote , Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee were collectively targeted with # releasethememo messages over 217,000 times . Ra\u00fal Labrador , Zeldin , King , Meadows , Jordan and Gaetz\u2014all of whom promoted # releasethememo to the public and their colleagues\u2014were targeted more than 550,000 times in 11 days . By the time Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke in favor of releasing the memo , he had been targeted with more than 225,000 messages about it .\nTrump , whom the Washington Post reported was swayed by the opinions of some of the congressmen listed above , was targeted more than a million times . Fox News personality Sean Hannity , said to speak daily with Trump , was targeted 245,000 times and became a significant promoter of the hashtag . Hannity , of course , knows exactly what he is doing , and was recently showered with praise for his propaganda skills by colleague Geraldo Rivera , who argued \u201c Nixon never would have been forced to resign if [ Hannity ] existed \u201d back in the \u2019 70s .\nA year after it should have become an indisputable fact that Russia launched a sophisticated , lucky , daring , aggressive campaign against the American public , we \u2019 re as exposed and vulnerable as we ever were\u2014if not more so , because now so many tools we might have sharpened to aid us in this fight seem blunted and discarded by the very people who should be honing their edge . There is no leadership . No one is building awareness of how these automated influence campaigns are being used against us . Maybe everyone still thinks if they are the one to control it , then they win , and they \u2019 ll do it better , more ethically . For example , by using it to achieve a political goal like releasing the Nunes memo .\nSocial media platforms have worked diligently to make us believe they had no idea this was happening , or that they are working to expose and correct the problem . But the algorithms work exactly as they are supposed to\u2014in one aspect , by reinforcing your own beliefs without challenging them , and in another , by creating perceptions of popularity that are intentionally false and coercive . If the Twitter analysis referred to by the Daily Beast has been accurately conveyed by the source , there should be many questions . How are they determining influence ? Did Twitter know the origins of the # releasethememo campaign when it suspended some ( apparently many ) of the accounts involved ? In which case , did they do so to hide some of the aspects of computational propaganda at play , choosing to say it was an issue of free speech\u2014an \u201c organic \u201d \u201c Republican \u201d campaign flourishing on a healthy platform\u2014rather than one of national security\u2014the infestation of their platform with the deep machinery of manipulation , a portion of which is foreign ?\nA recent analysis from DFRLab mapped out how modern Russian propaganda is highly effective because so many diverse messaging elements are so highly integrated . Far-right elements in the United States have learned to emulate this strategy , and have used it effectively with their own computational propaganda tactics\u2014as demonstrated by the \u201c Twitter rooms \u201d and documented alt-right bot-nets pushing a pro-Trump narrative .\nThis gets at a deeper issue : The problem with the term \u201c fake news \u201d is that it is completely wrong , denoting a passive intention . What is happening on social media is very real ; it is not passive ; and it is information warfare . There is very little argument among analytical academics about the overall impact of \u201c political bots \u201d that seek to influence how we think , evaluate and make decisions about the direction of our countries and who can best lead us\u2014even if there is still difficulty in distinguishing whose disinformation is whose . Samantha Bradshaw , a researcher with Oxford University \u2019 s Computational Propaganda Research Project who has helped to document the impact of `` polbot '' activity , told me : \u201c Often , it \u2019 s hard to tell where a particular story comes from . Alt-right groups and Russian disinformation campaigns are often indistinguishable since their goals often overlap . But what really matters is the tools that these groups use to achieve their goals : Computational propaganda serves to distort the political process and amplify fringe views in ways that no previous communication technology could . \u201d\nThis machinery of information warfare remains within social media \u2019 s architecture . The challenge we still have in unraveling what happened in 2016 is how hard it is to pry the Russian components apart from those built by the far- and alt-right\u2014they flex and fight together , and that alone should tell us something . As should the fact that there is a lesser far-left architecture that is coming into its own as part of this machine . And they all play into the same destructive narrative against the American mind .\nSo what are the lessons of # releasethememo ? Regardless of how much of the campaign was American and how much was Russian , it \u2019 s clear there was a massive effort to game social media and put the Nunes memo squarely on the national agenda\u2014and it worked to an astonishing degree . The bottom line is that the goals of the two overlapped , so the origin\u2014human , machine or otherwise\u2014doesn \u2019 t actually matter . What matters is that someone is trying to manipulate us , tech companies are proving hopelessly unable or unwilling to police the bad actors manipulating their platforms , and politicians are either clueless about what to do about computational propaganda or\u2014in the case of # releasethememo\u2014are using it to achieve their goals . Americans are on their own .\nAnd , yes , that also reinforces the narrative the Russians have been pushing since 2015 : You \u2019 re on your own ; be angry , and burn things down . Would that a leader would step into this breech , and challenge the advancing victory of the bots and the cynical people behind them .",

And they can be surprisingly effective.\n\nThe anatomy of the campaign\n\nOn the afternoon of January 18, a group of congressmen started tweeting about the Nunes FISA abuse memo. At 3:47 p.m., Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) went on FoxBusiness and gave an interview about the supposed memo. None of them, to this point, were talking about #releasethememo\u2014the hashtag, that is.\n\nThe hashtag originated with Twitter user @underthemoraine at 3:52 p.m. on January 18. The tweet tags the president, @realDonaldTrump. The account for @underthemoraine, most recently named \u201cLois Lerner Testimony\u201d and whose bio references the Lerner testimony and #MAGA, is currently marked as restricted by Twitter for \u201cunusual activity.\u201d\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nJudging from weather reports that are occasionally posted, pictures of the woods, and tweets to friends, @underthemoraine appears to be a real guy in Michigan, a battleground state (we believe we have confirmed his real name/identity, but will not use it since he does not). He has a history of tweeting about trending conservative media topics\u2014Antifa, #BlueLivesMatter, boycotting the NFL, social media filtering out conservative views, the climate change \"hoax,\" special counsel Robert Mueller. He engages with far-right media\u2014Breitbart, InfoWars, Alex Jones, Drudge\u2014and occasionally posts on astronomy and UFOs. Moraine has few followers (74 at last count) and is not particularly influential. However, his account is followed by several accounts that are probable bots as well as by the verified account of the Michigan Republican Party (@MIGOP, which first used #releasethememo at 5:41 a.m. on January 19), an account that likely auto-follows other accounts that engage with it.\n\nAt 4 p.m., one of Moraine\u2019s followers, @KARYN19138585\u2014an account that has the 8-digit fingerprint associated with some Russian bot accounts\u2014responds to @underthemoraine\u2019s tweet, saying Moraine is the first one tweeting about this breaking news topic.\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nThe KARYN account is an interesting example of how bots lay a groundwork of information architecture within social media. It was registered in 2012, tweeting only a handful of times between July 2012 and November 2013 (mostly against President Barack Obama and in favor of the GOP). Then the account goes dormant until June 2016\u2014the period that was identified by former FBI Director James Comey as the beginning of the most intense phase of Russian operations to interfere in the U.S. elections. The frequency of tweets builds from a few a week to a few a day. By October 11, there are dozens of posts a day, including YouTube videos, tweets to political officials and influencers and media personalities, and lots of replies to posts by the Trump team and related journalists. The content is almost entirely political, occasionally mentioning Florida, another battleground state, and sometimes posting what appear to be personal photos (which, if checked, come from many different phones and sources and appear \u201cborrowed\u201d). In October 2016, KARYN is tweeting a lot about Muslims/radical Islam attacking democracy and America; how Bill Clinton had lots of affairs; alleged financial wrongdoing on Clinton\u2019s part; and, of course, WikiLeaks.\n\nAll of these topics were promoted by Russian disinformation campaigns. There is little content promoting Trump; it is almost entirely attacking Clinton. On November 1, for example, KARYN posted a YouTube video showing \u201cthe video Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want you to see\u201d\u2014\u201cdocumenting\u201d alleged health concerns (it got almost half a million views on YouTube). After November 9, the day after the election, KARYN\u2019s tweet volume drops back to a couple a day. Since the revival of the account, there are more than 32,000 tweets and replies\u2014about 66 tweets per day, plus a similar amount of likes. Based on this pattern and and the digital forensics, it\u2019s clear KARYN is a bot\u2014a bot that follows a random Republican guy in Michigan with 70-some followers. Why?\n\nBots both gather and disseminate information\u2014the \u201cgathering\u201d part is important, and rarely discussed. So, let\u2019s say KARYN was created, abandoned (as many fake accounts often are), and then reactivated and \u201cslaved\u201d to an effort to smear Clinton online. Why would a bot account follow some nobody in Michigan? It would be fair to say that if you were setting up accounts to track views representative of a Trump-supporter, @underthemoraine would be a pulse to keep a finger on\u2014the virtual Michigan \u201cman in the diner\u201d or \u201ctaxi driver\u201d that journalists are forever citing as proof of conversations with real, nonpolitical humans in swing states. KARYN follows hundreds of such accounts, plus conservative media, and a lot of other bots.\n\nBack to the afternoon of January 18: KARYN retweets Moraine\u2019s post, becoming the third account to use the hashtag; around this time, automation networks\u2014groups of accounts that automatically retweet, reply to or repost identical content, sometimes using software platforms and sometimes using lists\u2014start weighing in on the hashtag.\n\nThe second account to tweet #releasethememo is @well_in_usa\u2014an account opened in July 2014, now largely deleted. The account, which in 2016 was tweeting a steady stream of anti-Clinton, pro-Trump content, weighing in on topics like \u201cClinton enabling sexual predators\u201d and #ArrestSoros, has been deleting its tweets since people started watching #releasethememo (as of January 25, everything after December 19, 2017, was deleted; as of January 29, only a handful of replies from 2017 remained; on February 2, retweeted content from 2016 is visible again)\u2014but we have some of them from an archived version.\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nIn addition to tweeting #releasethememo to @realdonaldtrump, Well tags @RepMattGaetz and @LizClaman of Fox News, quote-tweeting a post on the Nunes memo from the fanatically pro-Trump media personality Bill Mitchell. This was, primarily, what the Well account did\u2014retweet and reply to accounts with hashtags included, marking them into messaging campaigns. Well is engaging and directing traffic to a specific group of accounts on specific discussions. These accounts often have short shelf lives, appearing as needed and disappearing when their usefulness has passed (or once flagged by Twitter).\n\nThe fourth account to enter this mix is \u201cQueen Covfefe\u201d @clasimpmv, which tweeted #releasethememo at 4 p.m. and also retweeted the original Moraine tweet around 6:18 p.m. Though we have confirmed her identity, we will not use it here, as she does not. The twitter ID is the same as an email listed on a linked-in account for a woman in South Carolina, an early primary state, who is a nutritionist and hemp-oil promoter. The profile photo was changed from an anonymous meme to a picture of the woman with Trump at a political rally after she was accused of being a bot for promoting the hashtag. A woman with the same name was recently interviewed by a German newspaper for a profile on Trump supporters. So, this seems to be the account of a real person voluntarily and quite deliberately participating in the effort to amplify the reach of #releasethememo.\n\nIn the 24 months since the account was established, Queen has tweeted 47,000 times\u2014about 65 times per day, so about the same rate as the active bot. She has tweeted #releasethememo hundreds of times in a few days. She often retweets lists of other twitter handles (sometimes hundreds of names per list)\u2014\u201cpeople\u201d that you are supposed to follow and retweet to build your own following and influence. They are often labeled with \u201cFollow/retweet/comment for a follow back!\u201d Two such lists, for example, were retweeted by Queen on January 19 and February 2. Each list includes at least a few bots. Some bots are amplifiers\u2014in the simplest form, they automatically follow accounts that follow them, and retweet tweets from those accounts (sometimes, other parameters such as keywords are factored in). It is an element of automation. The rest is about network, echo chamber, fake influence and amplification.\n\nPopping up a little further down the line, around 6 p.m., is \u201cStonewall Jackson\u201d @1776Stonewall, an anonymous account of a supposed \u201cAmerican history buff\u201d who has around 50,000 followers, far more than early accounts that had been engaging in #releasethememo. It was launched in November 2016 (tweeting around 57 times/day), and some personal-seeming tweets reference New York. It is a \u201cfollow-back\u201d account, so partially automated and positioned within an amplification network; it is followed by and follows many likely Russian bots, plus accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers that automatically retweet Stonewall\u2019s content. It tweets once or twice a day about history\u2014baseball, the Cold War, the Civil War, astronauts, The Dukes of Hazzard, etc.\u2014but primarily, it is far-right U.S. political content.\n\nFor the first few hours, only fringe accounts promote #releasethememo. But accounts like Queen (who had just under 5,000 followers) and Stonewall begin to retweet each other and push the hashtag to their followers with explicit instructions to \u201cmake it trend.\u201d\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nThese accounts are organizers and amplifiers. Technically, they both probably qualify as \u201ccyborgs\u201d\u2014accounts with \u201chuman conductors\u201d that are partly automated and linked to networks that automatically amplify content.\n\nBut in Queen\u2019s case, she is something interesting: essentially, a willing human bot. The organization of conservative accounts like these using \u201cTwitter rooms\u201d to coordinate their efforts was previously reported on by Politico. Her account automatically reposts hashtags and memes and contributes to campaigns that she and the other promoters understand are purposeful attempts to game the algorithms and \u201cmake things trend.\u201d She and others simultaneously understand who needs to be targeted with this information\u2014in this case, the president, right-influencers and specific members of Congress. She may be a real person with real beliefs in Trump and what he represents, but when she tweets hundreds of times over the course of a week using #releasethememo, while artificially enhancing her followers (using the \u201cfollow-back\u201d lists, etc.) and exhorting others to amplify the hashtag, she is just as much an element of computational propaganda against the American public as a Russian bot.\n\n\n\n***\n\nUse any basic analytical software to scroll through the early promoters of #releasethememo, and you\u2019ll see most of the accounts meet basic criteria for bot/troll/cyborg suspicion\u2014what the Atlantic Council\u2019s open-source intelligence research group DFRLab describes as \u201cactivity, amplification, and anonymity.\u201d There is also a consistent theme in the list of identities\u2014the repetition of certain words (deplorable, Texas, mom, veteran) and certain first names; use of an American flag emoji at the end of the name; specific numbers or patterns of numerical sequences associated with bots; names changed to hashtags, or frequently shifted between trending right-media topics (Benghazi, NFL boycott, the memo, the emails); photos that aren\u2019t faces, or not unobscured faces, or certainly not of them if they are.\n\nThere is little chance an organic or incidental community, even of friends or acquaintances, would look this way online so holistically, tweeting together in such tight intervals. Several of the accounts involved in the initial promotion of this hashtag have subsequently been restricted or suspended by Twitter. Online data analysts said many accounts used to promote the hashtag were recently created, with more being created and disappearing after the hashtag appeared. Thousands still had the default profile photos. CNN\u2019s analysis found that hundreds of accounts created after the hashtag first appeared were fueling the viral trend.\n\nCross-reference this analysis and inputs from things like the Hamilton68 dashboard, and you can see #releasethememo is carried forward by automated accounts overnight after it begins to trend. It continued to do so from its appearance until the memo was released. The volume and noise matter\u2014and so does the targeting.\n\nA key function of the accounts discussed above is that they tweet at key influencers with these messaging campaigns\u2014media personalities, far-right brand names, and elected officials who might pick up the info or hashtag and legitimize it by repeating it. The accounts tweeting #releasethememo immediately began to target the president (not an unusual occurrence), but also the Trumpiest of congressmen\u2014Republicans Steve King of Iowa, Gaetz, Lee Zeldin of New York, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Jim Jordan of Ohio, etc.\u2014as well as alt- and far-right influencers and media personalities. A few active verified accounts, including @KamVTV\u2014an account that often appears as the first verified amplifier of bot and far-right content\u2014and @scottpresler, picked up the hashtag, and others retweeted tweets sent to them from sketchy accounts. (@saracarterDC of Fox News, for example, RTed an account that is a month old and has already tweeted 1,200 times, including posting content from (other) bots and fake profiles.)\n\n\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\n\n\n\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nThis is a basic social media information operation: Any one of these targets could see the hashtag in their mentions, replies and quoted-tweets. That\u2019s the goal of the coordination and amplification, at least some of which is automated\u2014and the purpose of which is to game the algorithms and \u201ctrend\u201d a topic.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe hashtag #releasethememo wasn\u2019t the only attempt to dominate online discussion. Before being targeted by amplification campaigns, there were other hashtags being put around by conservative social media mobilizers that either didn\u2019t take off\u2014#FISAgate, #FISAmemo, #releasethedocument, #releasethefile\u2014and others that were previously used as catch-alls for conspiracies\u2014#DeepState, #Transparency, etc. For example, Zeldin tweeted at 4:27 p.m. on January 18 that he had just read the FISA memo and called for its public release.\n\nHe used the hashtag #transparency. In the 4 hours after that tweet, there were more than 500 tweets targeting him with the hashtag #releasethememo. At 8:28 p.m., Zeldin tweeted #releasethememo from his verified congressional account.\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nVerified alt- or far-right personalities\u2014@gatewaypundit, @jacobawohl, @scottpresler, among others\u2014began using the hashtag, in particular tagging Gaetz. At 9:53 p.m., WikiLeaks tweeted #releasethememo. Before midnight, King, Meadows and Gaetz had all tweeted #releasethememo; so had Laura Ingraham, a massively influential conservative media personality with 2 million followers. Each time an influential verified account used the hashtag, it was rapidly promoted by a vast network of accounts. From its appearance until midnight, #releasethememo was used more than 670,000 times.\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nBy midnight, the hashtag was being used 250,000 times per hour. At 2:53 a.m. on January 19, the pro-Trump conservative personality Bill Mitchell was posting an article from Breitbart about how #releasethememo was trending online. The hashtag had become the organizing framework for multiple stories and lanes of activity, focusing them into one column, which got a big boost from right-stream media and twitter personalities.\n\nSome, like Breitbart, would argue this volume is representative of the outpouring of grass-roots support for the topic. But compare this time period to other recent significant events. During a similar duration of time covering the Women\u2019s March on January 20\u2014when more than a million marchers were estimated to be involved in demonstrations across the country\u2014there was a total volume of about 606,000 tweets using the #womensmarch2018 hashtag during its peak (being used at a pace of 87,000 times per hour). During the NFL playoff game the next day (#jaxvsNE), there was a volume of 253,000 tweets, with a top speed of about 75,000 tweets/hour.\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nMolly McKew/Contributed\n\nThe pace and scale of the appearance and amplification of #releasethememo is barely even comparable. This is because the hashtag benefited from computational promotion already built into the system. It was used to target lawmakers who would play a role in releasing the memo\u2014lawmakers who argued that there was public pressure to release the memo. Up until the time of the vote, Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee were collectively targeted with #releasethememo messages over 217,000 times. Ra\u00fal Labrador, Zeldin, King, Meadows, Jordan and Gaetz\u2014all of whom promoted #releasethememo to the public and their colleagues\u2014were targeted more than 550,000 times in 11 days. By the time Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke in favor of releasing the memo, he had been targeted with more than 225,000 messages about it.\n\nTrump, whom the Washington Post reported was swayed by the opinions of some of the congressmen listed above, was targeted more than a million times. Fox News personality Sean Hannity, said to speak daily with Trump, was targeted 245,000 times and became a significant promoter of the hashtag. Hannity, of course, knows exactly what he is doing, and was recently showered with praise for his propaganda skills by colleague Geraldo Rivera, who argued \u201cNixon never would have been forced to resign if [Hannity] existed\u201d back in the \u201970s.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nA year after it should have become an indisputable fact that Russia launched a sophisticated, lucky, daring, aggressive campaign against the American public, we\u2019re as exposed and vulnerable as we ever were\u2014if not more so, because now so many tools we might have sharpened to aid us in this fight seem blunted and discarded by the very people who should be honing their edge. There is no leadership. No one is building awareness of how these automated influence campaigns are being used against us. Maybe everyone still thinks if they are the one to control it, then they win, and they\u2019ll do it better, more ethically. For example, by using it to achieve a political goal like releasing the Nunes memo.\n\nSocial media platforms have worked diligently to make us believe they had no idea this was happening, or that they are working to expose and correct the problem. But the algorithms work exactly as they are supposed to\u2014in one aspect, by reinforcing your own beliefs without challenging them, and in another, by creating perceptions of popularity that are intentionally false and coercive. If the Twitter analysis referred to by the Daily Beast has been accurately conveyed by the source, there should be many questions. How are they determining influence? Did Twitter know the origins of the #releasethememo campaign when it suspended some (apparently many) of the accounts involved? In which case, did they do so to hide some of the aspects of computational propaganda at play, choosing to say it was an issue of free speech\u2014an \u201corganic\u201d \u201cRepublican\u201d campaign flourishing on a healthy platform\u2014rather than one of national security\u2014the infestation of their platform with the deep machinery of manipulation, a portion of which is foreign?\n\nA recent analysis from DFRLab mapped out how modern Russian propaganda is highly effective because so many diverse messaging elements are so highly integrated. Far-right elements in the United States have learned to emulate this strategy, and have used it effectively with their own computational propaganda tactics\u2014as demonstrated by the \u201cTwitter rooms\u201d and documented alt-right bot-nets pushing a pro-Trump narrative.\n\nThis gets at a deeper issue: The problem with the term \u201cfake news\u201d is that it is completely wrong, denoting a passive intention. What is happening on social media is very real; it is not passive; and it is information warfare. There is very little argument among analytical academics about the overall impact of \u201cpolitical bots\u201d that seek to influence how we think, evaluate and make decisions about the direction of our countries and who can best lead us\u2014even if there is still difficulty in distinguishing whose disinformation is whose. Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher with Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Research Project who has helped to document the impact of \"polbot\" activity, told me: \u201cOften, it\u2019s hard to tell where a particular story comes from. Alt-right groups and Russian disinformation campaigns are often indistinguishable since their goals often overlap. But what really matters is the tools that these groups use to achieve their goals: Computational propaganda serves to distort the political process and amplify fringe views in ways that no previous communication technology could.\u201d\n\nThis machinery of information warfare remains within social media\u2019s architecture. The challenge we still have in unraveling what happened in 2016 is how hard it is to pry the Russian components apart from those built by the far- and alt-right\u2014they flex and fight together, and that alone should tell us something. As should the fact that there is a lesser far-left architecture that is coming into its own as part of this machine. And they all play into the same destructive narrative against the American mind.\n\n***\n\nSo what are the lessons of #releasethememo? Regardless of how much of the campaign was American and how much was Russian, it\u2019s clear there was a massive effort to game social media and put the Nunes memo squarely on the national agenda\u2014and it worked to an astonishing degree. The bottom line is that the goals of the two overlapped, so the origin\u2014human, machine or otherwise\u2014doesn\u2019t actually matter. What matters is that someone is trying to manipulate us, tech companies are proving hopelessly unable or unwilling to police the bad actors manipulating their platforms, and politicians are either clueless about what to do about computational propaganda or\u2014in the case of #releasethememo\u2014are using it to achieve their goals. Americans are on their own.\n\nAnd, yes, that also reinforces the narrative the Russians have been pushing since 2015: You\u2019re on your own; be angry, and burn things down. Would that a leader would step into this breech, and challenge the advancing victory of the bots and the cynical people behind them.\n\nThis article tagged under: Russia\n\nNet Effect",
