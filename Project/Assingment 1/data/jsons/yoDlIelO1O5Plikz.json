It has been a frustrating and opaque process for her , to say the least .\n\u201c I have easily called an average of 100 times a day since I began the process , \u201d Bradford told me in an email . \u201c It feels like it \u2019 s the early 2000s and you are calling into a radio station . Most mornings I wake up early so that I can be one of the first people to call in , but apparently a lot of people have had the same idea . \u201d\nBradford is one of an estimated 1.2 million people in New York \u2014 and more than 22 million people nationwide \u2014 who suddenly found themselves out of work in the past several weeks and have been trying to access unemployment insurance as the coronavirus continued spreading across the United States . The staggering fallout of an economic crisis on par with the Great Depression has hit certain sectors of the economy , like restaurants , small businesses , and retail , especially hard .\nThe recently passed CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance eligibility , meaning most people who have been laid off will qualify for an additional $ 600 a week from the federal government . The bill also established a new program \u2014 called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ( PUA ) \u2014 that provides benefits for freelancers , gig economy workers , independent contractors , and self-employed individuals who previously were not eligible . The expanded benefits will continue until July , and members of Congress are already looking at options to extend it .\nBut the rollout of these benefits has been rocky and uneven . Some states , like Ohio , won \u2019 t even start accepting PUA applications until mid-May ( retroactive pay was written into the law , so people who are unable to file until then won \u2019 t lose out on their full benefits ) .\nThe unemployment insurance fiasco is a perfect storm : a massive , crippling recession meeting many state programs that were underfunded and out of date to begin with . Programs in states like Florida \u2014 where former Gov . Rick Scott purposely designed the online system to make it hard for people to access , the Washington Post reported \u2014 have made it even more difficult for people to get help when they need it most .\nCurrent Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that just 4 percent of people who have applied in Florida have so far received unemployment benefits \u2014 that \u2019 s 33,623 people out of more than 850,000 applicants .\n\u201c These benefits are layered on top of a system that works well in some states and works terribly in others , \u201d said Michele Evermore , a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project . \u201c When a recession rolls around , how are people surprised that it \u2019 s hard to get benefits ? \u201d\nWhere you live can determine how soon you get your unemployment insurance benefits\nUnemployment insurance benefits vary by state , but the amount you receive is not the only factor that depends on where you live . The process to get the money is faster in some states than others .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 was contacted by a recently laid-off worker named AJ in Florida , who said he and his wife were trying to access Florida \u2019 s online unemployment system with very little success .\n\u201c My wife and I try to apply for unemployment and the website does not load . The phone system also does not work , \u201d he said . \u201c There is no alternative , we just keep going in circles . We feel abandoned on all levels . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a completely different story in Washington state , where Stevie Hanna got the news she would be laid off from her job at a market research company on April 1 , \u201c which is not the day to fire people , \u201d she added .\nIt was a stressful time ; Hanna had moved to Washington for her job and had lived there only about four months . With some confusion about whether her work history made her eligible for benefits in Washington or in her former state of Michigan , it took about a week for Washington \u2019 s Employment Security Department to process her claim .\n\u201c Today everything is good , but it was touch and go for a week , \u201d Hanna told me in a phone interview . \u201c But at this point I \u2019 m impressed that they were able to get me through the system in a few weeks . ... I have no idea how I got that lucky . I do feel very fortunate that I am in Washington . \u201d\nBrigit Stadler , a self-employed lifestyle and documentary photographer , also lives in Washington state . Her work is seasonal , and when the coronavirus hit , she had to cancel the cherry blossom photo shoots she had planned for this spring in Seattle . Because Stadler owns her own business , she couldn \u2019 t just apply for traditional UI right off the bat ; she had to wait for Washington to set up its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program .\n\u201c I know others in other states are having a lot of difficulties filing , so I \u2019 ve basically just been checking for updates so as to not add to an already overloaded system , \u201d Stadler told me . \u201c I \u2019 ll be applying for benefits on Monday now that they \u2019 ve given us a firm date for when the system will be able to handle those of us who are self-employed . \u201d\nStadler recognizes she \u2019 s one of the lucky ones ; her husband is still employed and able to help support her and their two sons . But she was just starting to turn a profit with her business , and the loss of her photography income has been a blow to her efforts to pay down student loans and have extra income to help pay for the cost of living in Seattle .\n\u201c While we \u2019 re in a very privileged position , the lost income isn \u2019 t insignificant , as Seattle is still a very expensive place , \u201d she said .\nIn more ways than one , Washington seems to be ahead of the curve with its response to the coronavirus . Not only have cases and deaths fallen in a state that was considered an initial hot spot in the US , but Washington also announced that its expanded unemployment insurance benefits \u2014 including the PUA program for freelancers \u2014 was scheduled to be up and running by April 18 . That was a lot sooner than some other states .\nIn New York City , submitting her online application was just the first step for Bradford . Because she worked multiple part-time jobs , she had to call the unemployment office and speak to a representative over the phone to complete the process . Then the hard part began .\nBradford told me that each time she called , she got one of three responses : one telling her that her call couldn \u2019 t be completed as dialed , one automated message that all lines were busy , and finally , another automated reply that asked questions about her claim ( which she answered using her phone \u2019 s keypad ) , collected her Social Security number , and transferred her to a representative . But unless someone is available at that exact moment , callers are disconnected and have to start the process over again , Bradford said .\n\u201c As someone who works in entertainment , I have many , many friends going through this process , and [ I ] can count on one hand the amount of people I know who have been able to get through the phone lines , \u201d she added . Bradford got so frustrated that she called Gov . Andrew Cuomo \u2019 s office directly .\nThe last Bradford had heard , New York had redone its website and was no longer asking applicants to call ; instead , people would be contacted directly . As of April 17 \u2014 a month after she first applied \u2014 she hadn \u2019 t yet received a call .\n\u201c I will be okay for the next month or so , but if this lasts into the summer , that will no longer be the case and my savings will essentially be depleted , \u201d Bradford told me . \u201c It has made me more cautious with my spending , and even when things go back to normal , I and many many others will have to recover from this lost income . \u201d\nMany states had underfunded unemployment insurance systems before the coronavirus hit\nCongress passing expanded unemployment benefits was just the first step . The process of actually getting that money into the bank accounts of people who need it is much harder .\nStates first have to wait for the Trump administration to issue guidance so they know they \u2019 re administering a benefit correctly . Then they have to set up their own policies and interpret them to decide who qualifies , Evermore said . Finally , states have to program the computers in their unemployment systems with the new information \u2014 and some states rely on mainframes and programming that haven \u2019 t been updated since the 1970s .\n\u201c The key aspects of UI were weak going into this , \u201d said Andy Stettner , a senior fellow at the Century Foundation . \u201c The IT infrastructure was weak ; most states hadn \u2019 t gotten off of these ancient mainframes . The concern is , they \u2019 ve never done anything with this type of volume . \u201d\nA recent report by The Verge \u2019 s Makena Kelly found that at least 12 states use a decades-old coding language called COBOL in their UI offices , which means specific programmers who know how to use the language are needed to run it . With so many laid-off workers trying to access benefits at once , the old code on some of these systems is crashing websites and leading to other problems .\n\u201c There is no alternative , we just keep going in circles . We feel abandoned on all levels . \u201d\nThe process is more straightforward for people who have been laid off from an employer and are eligible for regular UI , but it \u2019 s very complicated for freelancers and others who are waiting for PUA programs to be ready for applicants . Washington state , as previously mentioned , is seemingly ahead of the curve , with a goal of getting its PUA program up and running by April 18 . After setting an initial date of April 30 , Massachusetts announced it would start accepting PUA applications this week . Officials in Pennsylvania said freelancers and gig workers could start applying by the end of the month .\nBut other states , including Ohio , are already looking at a May timeline before they can get their PUA programs ready to accept applications , and others haven \u2019 t released timelines . New York and Michigan , for instance , are asking people to submit PUA claims but are holding on to them until their programs are up and running .\nThere \u2019 s consensus in Congress that another relief bill is needed , and Democrats have been talking about either extending the extra $ 600 a week in federal aid or adding more weeks before an individual would be kicked off regular UI benefits ( without the extra $ 600 per week ) , according to a senior Democratic aide .\nBut the problems that currently exist have led unemployment experts like Stettner and Evermore to say that Congress also needs to fund the system itself by helping states add more employees and get better technology to help connect people to the benefits they so badly need .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really not a sexy item to fund UI administration , \u201d Evermore said , noting it \u2019 s an issue that has to compete against other demands , like education funding and cancer research . \u201c The only times any improvements have ever happened with UI has been because a recession exposed holes in the coverage . \u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she recognizes the need , but also admitted it could take weeks before Congress is able to appropriate the money . ( Congress is not set to return to Capitol Hill until May 4 at the earliest . )\n\u201c The states need resources in order to administer the UI , \u201d Pelosi said . \u201c Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable . So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this . \u201d\nIn the meantime , the holes in the system are being blown wide open with a mammoth recession .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives . Our mission has never been more vital than it is in this moment : to empower you through understanding . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s work is reaching more people than ever , but our distinctive brand of explanatory journalism takes resources \u2014 particularly during a pandemic and an economic downturn .
