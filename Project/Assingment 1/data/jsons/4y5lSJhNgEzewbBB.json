    "content": "Rolling Stone 's high-profile story about sexual assault on campus appears to be falling apart in the wake of serious questions raised about a horrifying alleged gang-rape used as its central example .\nIt is a depressing certainty that this story will be used for years to come as a defense by those who do not want to believe rape victims ' allegations . But that is the wrong lesson to draw . Rather , this story should be a reminder of how difficult it is to accurately report on traumatic events \u2014 and the heightened ethical responsibilities that fall on journalists who do so .\n`` A Rape On Campus '' began with a narrative told by a young woman named only as `` Jackie '' about a gang rape that she claimed to have experienced at a fraternity party . Rolling Stone issued an apology for the story today : `` There now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced . ''\nThis story should be a reminder of how difficult it is to accurately report on traumatic events\nRolling Stone 's statement places the blame on Jackie , accusing her of being unworthy of trust . But the fact is that the magazine failed to report this story in a careful and ethical way . The reporter , Sabrina Rubin Erdely , did not fully check the details of Jackie 's story before publishing them \u2014 or contact the alleged perpetrators involved . Today , the Washington Post reported that the fraternity where Jackie said the attack took place did not host a party on the night Jackie said she was raped , and that no member of the house fits Jackie 's description of her assailant .\nErdely claims that she was trying to protect Jackie , who feared that she might suffer retribution if Rolling Stone contacted her attackers . But failing to ensure that the story was accurate before exposing it to public scrutiny did n't protect Jackie . It left her vulnerable .\nI know that from first-hand experience . I was a lawyer before becoming a journalist , and I worked with refugees and other trauma victims . That taught me that it is incredibly difficult for traumatized people to tell an accurate story , even if they are trying to do so . There are many reasons for this . In severe cases , post-traumatic stress disorder can cause memory loss , or make the true details of stories too painful to recount . One client of mine would shut down physically when asked to recount certain events , falling into a narcoleptic sleep mid-sentence . Another time , a woman I was interviewing about her sexual assault suffered a mental break and regressed to childhood , begging me to bring her to her long-dead mother .\nEven in less severe cases , people 's stories often contained errors or omissions . Dates would be wrong . Sometimes people would mistakenly name the wrong group as being responsible for persecuting them . Clients would focus on some facts and leave out others . All of that could easily have been reason to doubt the entire story , but when I checked the fundamental facts involved against other evidence \u2014 medical records , news stories , sometimes even the accounts of the perpetrators themselves \u2014 they would turn out to be true .\npost-traumatic stress disorder can cause memory loss , or make the true details of stories too painful to recount\nThe problem , I came to realize , was not that people were making up stories , but that the details that seemed important to me were not what mattered to them .\nFor instance , when I asked one young woman how she could be unsure which armed group was responsible for the attack that had forced her and her family to flee their home , she told me , `` When someone comes to your house to kill you , you do n't ask them for their ID card . '' And there are some details that are simply difficult for anyone to notice and remember , such as the names of streets in a town with which a person is unfamiliar , the dates of events far in the past , or the faces of strangers they had never met before the trauma in question .\nThat meant that I had a responsibility to protect the people I interviewed by checking the details of their stories before exposing them to the scrutiny of the public or an immigration court .
