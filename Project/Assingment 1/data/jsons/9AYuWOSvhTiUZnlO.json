The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone wear some kind of face covering in public places , especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain . And health workers are donning additional coverings , such as gowns . Yet all such protective gear shares one significant problem : people still risk becoming infected with the novel coronavirus if they accidentally touch areas of the fabric that are contaminated with viral particles . So researchers are working to develop cloth that could inactivate or repel coronaviruses\u2014ideally including the one that causes COVID-19\u2014and other pathogens .\nPeople can transfer infectious particles to their hands if they touch the front of a mask during use or when they remove gowns or other PPE , according to Chandan Sen , director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering at Indiana University . He and his colleagues have been developing a way to render those particles and other infectious agents harmless . The team researches \u201c electroceutical \u201d materials that wirelessly \u201c generate electric fields across the surface of the fabric , \u201d Sen says . Those fields can disrupt the behavior of bacteria or viruses on the cloth .\n\u201c The beauty of this [ technology ] is the inherently simple design , \u201d he says . The polyester material is printed with alternating spots of silver and zinc resembling polka dots . They are one to two millimeters wide and spaced one millimeter apart . When the electroceutical material is dry , it functions as an ordinary fabric . But if it gets dampened\u2014say , with saliva , vapor from a coughed up droplet or other bodily fluids\u2014ions in the liquid trigger an electrochemical reaction . The silver and zinc then generate a weak electric field that zaps pathogens on the surface .\nThe researchers co-developed the material with the biotechnology company Vomaris Innovations in 2012 . Last year they showed that the technology could be used to treat bacterial biofilms in wounds . A clinical trial is underway to further evaluate the fabric \u2019 s effectiveness as a Food and Drug Administration\u2013cleared dressing for wound care , Sen says .\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic , Sen \u2019 s team tested its existing material on a different coronavirus strain that causes a respiratory illness in pigs and on an unrelated type of pathogen called a lentivirus . \u201c We wanted to know how broadly this principle could be applicable , \u201d he says . In a study posted on the preprint server ChemRxiv in May , Sen \u2019 s team reported that its electroceutical fabric destabilized both viruses , leaving them unable to infect cells . The researchers plan to submit the results to a peer-reviewed journal as well .\nTo study the fabric \u2019 s action , they placed a liquid solution containing viral particles onto the electroceutical fabric and a polyester control fabric without the metal dots .
