    "content": "Donald Trump is making the rounds on Capitol Hill Thursday , searching for unity with Republican leaders , including reluctant House Speaker Paul Ryan . But for some GOP lawmakers , backing the brash billionaire \u2013 or rather , not backing him \u2013 is more than a matter of agreeing on tax cuts or trade , immigration or national security .\n\u201c I will not support Mr. Trump , \u201d Rep. Carlos Curbelo ( R ) of Florida has told the CBS affiliate in Miami . \u201c That is not a political decision ; that is a moral decision . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s hard to know how many of his colleagues share this view . Congressman Curbelo , who caucuses with the pragmatic wing of the conference , says \u201c a lot \u201d of Republicans have such concerns , some expressing it publicly and others privately . On Tuesday , Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson , former speechwriter to President George W. Bush , articulated the moral dimension in a commentary :\n\u201c Those who support Trump , no matter how reluctantly , have crossed a moral boundary . They are standing with a leader who encourages prejudice and despises the weak . They are aiding the transformation of a party formed by Lincoln 's blazing vision of equality into a party of white resentment . Those who find this one of the normal , everyday compromises of politics have truly lost their way . \u201d\nThose are stiff words , and interviews with several Republican lawmakers in advance of Trump \u2019 s visit found that some did not agree with them . Some say Hillary Clinton is also an immoral choice , and for that reason , they \u2019 re reluctantly backing Trump . Others feel uncomfortable making a moral judgment at all , or don \u2019 t see this as a moral choice .\nBut \u201c personal and policy morality are always involved in the selection of our leaders , \u201d says the Rev . James Weiss , a professor of ethics at Boston College . Personal morality affects public behavior , and public policy always has a moral dimension \u2013 whether lawmakers are dealing with abortion , criminal justice , welfare , medical care , or even trade and taxes , he adds .\n\u201c The question is never whether morality plays a role , it \u2019 s to what extent it does , \u201d Reverend Weiss says .\nVoters \u2013 and politicians \u2013 will differ on that judgment .\nRep. Tim Huelskamp ( R ) of Kansas also has moral issues with Trump . The Kansan , a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus , questions Trump \u2019 s positions on \u201c life , family , and marriage , \u201d and so do a lot of other Republicans , he says . As a parent , he also worries about Trump \u2019 s language .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t get comfortable with a candidate if I \u2019 m worried about what he \u2019 ll say [ on TV ] in front of my 9-year-old that \u2019 s vulgar and crass . \u201d\nHe says he \u2019 s still sticking with Sen. Ted Cruz , even though the Texas Republican dropped out of the race last week after Trump took must-win Indiana .\nIn a last-ditch effort to rescue his campaign in the Hoosier state , Mr. Cruz lashed into Trump , calling him a \u201c serial philanderer , \u201d among other things . Trump has been open , even bragging , about his sexual exploits . He told reporters back in December that his \u201c indiscretions \u201d would be fair game for reporters , even as he \u2019 s made much of Bill Clinton \u2019 s womanizing .\nBut other Republicans see things differently . Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona , one of the most conservative members in the House , says he understands Curbelo \u2019 s perspective . Curbelo says he views both Trump and Mrs. Clinton as dishonest , and will vote for neither . He points out that there are typically 10 candidates for president on a Florida ballot .\nBut Congressman Franks argues that the choice is \u201c binary. \u201d And when the antiabortion lawmaker compares Trump with Clinton on moral principles , on respect for fellow human beings , on protecting the Constitution , and protecting the republic \u201c to keep it intact for future generations \u201d \u2013 on all those fronts \u201c there is no contest . Clinton will bring destruction to us in all of those areas , whereas Mr. Trump might . \u201d\nFranks was one of Trump \u2019 s most vociferous opponents in the primary . As a conservative , he says , he \u201c can not trust him to do the right thing. \u201d But he knows , he said Wednesday , \u201c that I can deeply trust Hillary Clinton to do the wrong thing every time. \u201d And so if it comes down to a vote between Trump and Clinton , he will choose Trump and urge others to do the same .\nOn the Senate side , another deep skeptic of Trump , moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine , says she wouldn \u2019 t sit in judgment of the presumed nominee . She has repeatedly called on him to stop insulting people , to make amends with the Muslim community and others whom he has alienated . \u201c But I \u2019 m not going to judge him as a human being. \u201d Indeed , she has not foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting him .\nSen.
