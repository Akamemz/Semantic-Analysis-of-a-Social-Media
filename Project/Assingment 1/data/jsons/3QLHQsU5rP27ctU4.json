    "content": "Remember President Trump \u2019 s tax returns ? It seems like a relic from the distant past , but only last December , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a trio of cases on whether the president could block his accounting firm and two of his banks from turning over eight years of tax returns and other financial records to Democratic-led House committees and New York City prosecutors . Trump \u2019 s lawyers have offered an extraordinarily expansive vision of his power as president , arguing that as chief executive he is immune from criminal investigations and congressional subpoenas . The cases were supposed to be heard in late March but were delayed over a month due to the COVID-19 crisis . Now , on Tuesday morning , the justices will finally hear arguments in one of the most momentous disputes over congressional power and presidential immunity in recent memory .\nThe timing could be bad for Trump , as the accounting firm and banks have already indicated that if the Supreme Court deems the requests for his records valid , they would turn over the documents . That would give Trump \u2019 s political opponents a new source to mine for information on how he makes and spends his money right before the 2020 presidential election . On the other hand , a ruling in Trump \u2019 s favor could ensure that his financial documents remain hidden for the foreseeable future .\nBut the outcome might not be that simple . A few weeks ago , the justices asked both sides to weigh in on whether the dispute between Trump and House Democrats is fundamentally political and , therefore , beyond the reach of the courts . A ruling that the courts are powerless to resolve this fight could translate into a loss for Trump since he wouldn \u2019 t have any power to stop his accounting firm or banks from handing over his records . But it \u2019 s not clear exactly what would happen if the Supreme Court stepped aside \u2014 and losing the courts as a referee in fights over subpoenas could also be a longer-term victory for the presidency , as Congress could lose its ability to make high-level executive branch officials actually comply with their subpoenas for documents or testimony .\n\u201c If Congress isn \u2019 t allowed to use the courts to resolve these disputes , we \u2019 d see even more brinksmanship on both sides , \u201d said Steve Vladeck , a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law . \u201c It would remove any incentive for cooperation or accommodation . And it would be a stunning , stunning blow to Congress \u2019 s oversight power over the executive branch . \u201d\nAt the heart of these cases is a question that \u2019 s come up again and again during Trump \u2019 s presidency : Is the president really protected from legal and congressional scrutiny ?\nTrump \u2019 s lawyers argue that even though investigators aren \u2019 t asking him for the records personally \u2014 House Democrats subpoenaed Trump \u2019 s financial documents from his banks and accounting firm , and New York City prosecutors subpoenaed his tax returns as part of a broader criminal investigation into Trump \u2019 s businesses \u2014 the prosecutors \u2019 subpoenas are still invalid because while Trump is in the White House , he is immune from criminal investigations . And they \u2019 ve also contended that the requests for his financial documents are outside of Congress \u2019 s legislative purview .\nAt this point , though , three trial court judges and three federal appeals court panels have all rejected those arguments , ruling that the banks and Trump \u2019 s accounting firm do in fact have to comply with the subpoenas . In the case involving the New York City prosecutors , a district court judge wrote that the idea that a president couldn \u2019 t be touched by a criminal investigation was \u201c repugnant to the nation \u2019 s governmental structure and constitutional values. \u201d Two appeals courts , meanwhile , ruled that the subpoenas did fall squarely under Congress \u2019 s oversight authority .\nThere are ways , however , for the justices to rule in Trump \u2019 s favor without endorsing his lawyers \u2019 argument that the president can \u2019 t be investigated by law enforcement or Congress .
