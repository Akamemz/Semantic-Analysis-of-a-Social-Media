    "content": "Donald Trump is not a candidate the American people would turn to in normal times . He \u2019 s too inexperienced , too eccentric , too volatile , too risky . Voting Trump is burning down the house to collect the insurance money \u2014 you don \u2019 t do it unless things are really , really bad .\nHere is Trump \u2019 s problem : Things are not really , really bad . In fact , things are doing much better than when President Obama came into office .\nUnemployment is 4.9 percent nationally \u2014 a number Trump knows is far from a crisis , because it \u2019 s lower than the unemployment rate Mike Pence is presiding over in Indiana , and Trump keeps bragging about his running mate \u2019 s economic record . The deficit has gone down in recent years , and the stock market has gone up . The end of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars mean fewer Americans are dying abroad .

Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country . ''\nAs Jon Favreau , a former speechwriter for Obama , wrote on Twitter , this was Trump \u2019 s `` Nightmare in America '' speech . The address had one goal , and one goal only : to persuade Americans that their country is a dangerous , besieged hellscape , and only Donald Trump can fix it .\nAnd so Trump spoke of the `` illegal immigrants with criminal records '' who are `` tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens .

Our borders are not swarming with illegal immigrants . Murder rates remain far below what the America of the '70s , '80s , and '90s experienced . Terrorism is a horror , but successful terrorist attacks are a rarity , and one that would be most straightforwardly addressed through gun control . No liberation is necessary .\n`` In this race for the White House , '' Trump said , `` I am the law and order candidate . '' And the law and order candidate can only win if there is a crisis of lawlessness and disorder . But there isn \u2019 t . Trump isn \u2019 t worried about your safety .
