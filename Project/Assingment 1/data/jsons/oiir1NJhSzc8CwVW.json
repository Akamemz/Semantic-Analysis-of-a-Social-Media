The Congressional Budget Office just released its most recent 10-year projections for federal spending and revenues . The picture is not pretty .\nA quick overview : This fiscal year , 2020 , the federal government will collect $ 3.6 trillion in tax revenues . But due to its spending addiction , the government will expend $ 4.6 trillion . This means that the government will have to borrow $ 1 trillion this year alone , in order to cover a deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP . This is the first trillion-dollar deficit not due to a global recession .\nThe money to fund the deficit comes from individual and institutional investors , both domestic and foreign . And for all the anti-China rhetoric out there , it 's worth remembering that China is the second largest foreign investor in our federal debt , right behind Japan . I guess that 's one Chinese import the Trump administration does n't seem to mind .\nAccording to the CBO , this enormous overspending will continue and expand over the next decade , from 21 percent of GDP to 23.4 percent . Revenue as a share of GDP is projected to grow from its current 16.4 percent level to 18 percent in 2030 , or $ 5.75 trillion . But that 's not enough to cover the $ 7.5 trillion the federal government will spend then , hence a projected budget deficit of $ 1.74 trillion .\nBecause deficits accumulate , it 's not surprising that our debt is growing . Debt held by the public will rise from 81 percent of GDP today to above 98 percent by 2030\u2014from $ 17.2 trillion today to $ 31.4 trillion then . When you add in the debt that Uncle Sam owes to other accounts within the government , like Social Security , you get a much bigger number .\nAll of the above , of course , assumes that the law as written today wo n't change . The CBO scores our budget outlook on the assumption that existing legislative provisions persist . However , everyone knows that some things will change . Congress will evade rules meant to limit spending , and\u2014as always\u2014it will indulge in a bipartisan spending binge while refusing to let popular tax cuts expire .\nThis , in part , explains why deficits in this report are $ 160 billion higher though 2029 than in the CBO 's prior estimates . As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains in recent commentary about the CBO report , `` The largest contributor to the projected increase is the appropriations package enacted in December , which included a permanent repeal of taxes enacted to finance the Affordable Care Act and the revival of various zombie extenders . That package added $ 500 billion to deficits through 2029 , with interest . ''\nThis time will be no different . There will be more spending and less revenue than projected . For instance , even if Congress is entirely under the control of Democrats , nobody really believes that they will let all of the middle-class tax cuts expire as planned in 2025 . I would not be surprised if the Democrats even manage to extract some spending increases for low-income Americans from the Republicans in exchange for extending these tax provisions . Also , given an opportunity to adopt another bipartisan spending package that adds hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficits , politicians on both sides of the aisle will shamelessly expose their spending addiction .\nThen , of course , depending on the president 's erratic behavior on trade , the effects of the trade war could have an even worse impact on the budget than currently projected . According to the CBO , the tariffs imposed over the past two years will reduce GDP in 2020 by 0.5 percent ( or more than $ 100 billion ) and `` reduce average real household income by $ 1,277 . '' The administration is happy to brag about the additional revenue collected from the tariffs , but there is a negative side to these import taxes , too .\nThankfully , the economy is doing well for now .
