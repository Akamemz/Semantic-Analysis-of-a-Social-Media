It \u2019 s been in the potential for him to deliver , as President , a different U.S. foreign policy ; one that de-emphasizes the traditional Western alliances and frees Russia to operate in the European theater as it pleases , with lifted sanctions and a few lucrative bilateral oil deals to boot .\nBut Trump as President hasn \u2019 t shown any inkling of the kind of competence or political skill\u2014or the political capital\u2014to do any of that . Even his Secretary of State , Exxon \u2019 s Rex Tillerson , has sounded a dubious note about the extent to which the United States will allow Moscow to flex its muscle around the world , which had to be a great disappointment to his good friend , \u201c V . Putin , \u201d as Trump labels him in tweets , using the common Russian nomenclature .\nThe Trump administration\u2014a claque of former \u201c ironic \u201d California high school racists , Pepe-the-fascist bloggers and neo-Crusader race conspiracists\u2014plus Trump \u2019 s blank-staring son-in-law ( when he \u2019 s not trying to buy the Miami Marlins ) and a couple of beleaguered veterans of the RNC\u2014has proven itself to be as bungling as it is malevolent . None of Team Trump \u2019 s \u201c shock and awe \u201d Big Ideas have been executed without extreme folly ; not the \u201c totally not Muslim \u201d travel ban , not the immigration raids , and not the wall Mexico won \u2019 t pay for . And for Russia , that can \u2019 t be good news , unless what they truly wanted from a President Trump was sheer American chaos , not policy change .\nRussian leaders seemed palpably freaked out when Gen. Michael Flynn , clearly seen as Moscow \u2019 s main man in Washington , was forced out of the Trump administration amid revelations that he conducted secret foreign policy on the phone with the Russian ambassador over Christmas , then lied to the vice president about it . It \u2019 s pretty difficult to imagine that Flynn acted without the direction , or at least the approval , of his boss , the then-incoming president .\nBut more alarming than the phone calls was the fact that Flynn was considered potentially compromised by a foreign power , by the Director of National Intelligence , the acting attorney general of the United States , Sally Yates , and others , and that the White House was told as much and still waited to act . Now , the Kremlin has reportedly ordered Russian media outlets to dial back their glowing Trump coverage , amid uncertainty about what comes next .\nThere are even reports that some Russian Trump enthusiasts are beginning to experience the first pangs of buyer \u2019 s ( well , hacker \u2019 s ) remorse .\nFrom Russia \u2019 s point of view , the rank incompetence of the Trump administration in handling everything from the Flynn situation to the poorly written travel ban executive order to their failure to conduct the kind of rudimentary vetting that keeps embarrassing things from happening\u2014like a half dozen proposed administration appointees failing their FBI background checks or Flynn \u2019 s preferred replacement , former Navy SEAL , Vice Admiral Bob Harward , turning down a job he considered a \u201c shit sandwich\u2014has to give some pause .
