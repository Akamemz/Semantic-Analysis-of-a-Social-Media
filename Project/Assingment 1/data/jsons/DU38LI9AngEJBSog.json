More than half of the 204 students responding trusted Lisa Bloom\u2019s tweet more the one from NPR, noting it had the most information. A sample student response: \u2018The best tweet for information is the first one because it actually shows him resigning in a picture, and it gives a caption saying that he is resigning.\u2019 Photo: Stanford History Education Group\n\nParents can instill early a healthy skepticism about published reports.

Almost 70% of 200 students responding didn't highlight the authorship as a reason for mistrust. A sample response: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t trust it because some millennials do have good money habits.\u2019 Photo: Stanford History Education Group\n\nBy age 18, 88% of young adults regularly get news from Facebook and other social media, according to a 2015 study of 1,045 adults ages 18 to 34 by the Media Insight Project.\n\nThis risks creating an \u201cecho chamber effect,\u201d because social media tends to feed users news items similar to those they\u2019ve read before, says Walter C.

Posts should cite multiple sources, and the information should be verifiable elsewhere, he says.\n\nDistinguishing Between Opinion and News As part of Stanford University\u2019s study of students and online news, it asked middle-school students which of the items above would they read to learn the facts. More than 60% of 200 respondents chose the opinion piece or failed to give clear reasons why they chose the news story. A sample response: \u2018I would not survive if we had year-round schools.
