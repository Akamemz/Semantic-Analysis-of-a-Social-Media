On his hands and knees, he crawls around a bright circle of light created by a streetlamp overhead.\n\nA woman passes, stops, takes in the scene.\n\n\"What are you looking for? Can I help?\"\n\n\"My car keys. Any chance you've seen them?\"\n\n\"You dropped them right around here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I dropped them way over there,\" he says, gesturing vaguely to some faraway spot on the other side of the lot.\n\n\"Then why are you looking here?\"\n\nThe man pauses to consider the question.\n\n\"Because this is where the light is.\"\n\nNew research from the Yale Child Study Center suggests that many preschool teachers look for disruptive behavior in much the same way: in just one place, waiting for it to appear.\n\nThe problem with this strategy (besides it being inefficient), is that, because of implicit bias, teachers are spending too much time watching black boys and expecting the worst.\n\nThe study\n\nLead researcher Walter Gilliam knew that to get an accurate measure of implicit bias among preschool teachers, he couldn't be fully transparent with his subjects about what, exactly, he was trying to study.\n\nImplicit biases are just that \u2014 subtle, often subconscious stereotypes that guide our expectations and interactions with people.\n\n\"We all have them,\" Gilliam says. \"Implicit biases are a natural process by which we take information, and we judge people on the basis of generalizations regarding that information.
