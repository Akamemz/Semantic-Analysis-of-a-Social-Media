Boonstra \u2019 s story , amplified by the conservative media , went national , as did the subsequent debunking of the AFP advertisement .\nBut how many people know who Christopher Schiff is ? Schiff , a Marine veteran , stars in this Americans for Prosperity ad attacking Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , claiming that his \u201c insurance costs are going way up because of Obamacare . \u201d\nThe ad was released last week . In that time Schiff has appeared on Fox News and his story has drawn fleeting attention from the right-wing press , but overall no one has really taken notice of the former Marine allegedly under fire from Obamacare . ( The Washington Post and PolitiFact attempted to verify Schiff \u2019 s claims , but neither was able to confirm his health coverage status ; PolitiFact warned his ad \u201c doesn \u2019 t include some important context and nuances . \u201d )\nAt the same time the political world was generally ignoring Christopher Schiff , it was taking increasing notice of Dean Angstadt , a self-employed logger who , with the coaching of a liberal friend , moved past his hostility to Obamacare and purchased a health plan just in time for heart valve replacement surgery .

Scott Brown , running for Senate in New Hampshire with a \u201c repeal Obamacare \u201d message , caught an earful from a Republican state representative who \u2019 d had his monthly premiums slashed by the ACA .
