He warns that Bush is \u201c losing \u201d the primary , but the truth is that Bush \u2019 s struggles \u2014 like Trump \u2019 s triumphs \u2014 are the product of conservative ideology itself .\nSpecifically , it \u2019 s the fault of Citizens United , and the tidal wave of outsider spending that it \u2019 s unleashed on American politics .

But he \u2019 s still right to think that if Trump-haters added Marco Rubio \u2019 s 7.3 percent , Carly Fiorina \u2019 s 6 percent , John Kasich \u2019 s 4.5 percent and Chris Christie \u2019 s 3.5 percent to Jeb \u2019 s 9.8 percent , they \u2019 d have a real challenger .\nIf the race suddenly became a duel between Bush and Trump , I \u2019 m honestly not sure that Bush would win . Trump could reasonably expect all or most of Ben Carson \u2019 s 10.3 percent , Ted Cruz \u2019 s 7.3 percent , Scott Walker \u2019 s 7.3 percent , Mike Huckabee \u2019 s 4 percent and Rand Paul \u2019 s 3.8 percent to come his way . But at the very least , Bush \u2019 s de facto position as the anti-Trump would make him seem bigger and more formidable than he does right now , stumbling as he is between dullness and inadequacy .\nEither way , it \u2019 s something of a moot point . As things stand , Bush can not distinguish himself from the rest of his \u201c establishment \u201d -friendly competitors , so he ends up looking like just one of the dozen-plus candidates who are not Donald Trump . Worse still , because Bush has already raised such an unfathomable amount of money for his super PAC , his inability to stand toe-to-toe with Trump makes him look in comparison not only drab but also weak . And there \u2019 s no one Republican voters hate more than the weak .\nOf course , that massive war chest is also a consequence of unlimited spending . The great irony , however , is that these new rules are , for Bush , something of a double-edged sword . On the one hand , they helped him make waves with eye-popping fundraisers .
