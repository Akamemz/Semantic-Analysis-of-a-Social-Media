    "content": "Democrats Have Wrapped Their Public Case On Impeachment . What Comes Next ?\nThe marathon of testimony in Democrats ' impeachment inquiry this week confirmed that the Ukraine affair , like so many earlier subplots in the era of President Trump , boils down to two big questions :\nWhat do the president 's words mean ? Can the president do what he did ?\nThe answers to those questions have been a partisan inkblot test since Trump exploded onto the political scene , and now they are burning again as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats decide how they 'll move ahead in a showdown over impeachment .\nThe overall facts of the case now are well established : Trump sought concessions this year from Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy .\nIn exchange for engagement and about $ 391 million in military assistance , Zelenskiy \u2014 and not an aide such as his prosecutor-general \u2014 had to announce investigations that Trump thought might help him in the 2020 election , witnesses said .\nThe White House froze aid for a period of weeks this year and ultimately released it . Zelenskiy never made a public statement about investigations .\nMembers of Congress and the witnesses did not agree about whether they heard Trump make a request of Zelenskiy politely \u2014 or whether Trump twisted the arm of a weaker counterpart with the expectation that his words would be taken as a demand .\nWitnesses and investigators also did not agree whether Trump had explicitly directed the aides \u2014 since dubbed `` the three amigos '' for Ukraine \u2014 that they were required to submit to the tasking of his personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani .\nOr whether what Trump did was , in so many words , shrug and say \u2014 Ukraine ?
