    "content": "Another passenger has boarded the S.S. Winnow : On Thursday , former Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper announced he was dropping out of the race for president .\nMany of the problems we identified with Hickenlooper \u2019 s campaign when he first entered the race ended up coming true . He lacked a geographic or demographic base , and he proved unable to stand out from a flashier field of candidates . Despite hopes that he would make some noise in the debates , he didn \u2019 t make a positive impression in the first and spoke less than any other candidate in the second .\nThe result : Hickenlooper never found his footing among actual voters . When he dropped out of the race , a majority of Democrats ( 56 percent ) still did not have an opinion of him , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 average of August polls . But even if Hickenlooper had more successfully gotten his name out there , he just wasn \u2019 t what voters were looking for . Even in Colorado , where he is well-known and well-liked among Democrats , Hickenlooper received just 7 percent of the vote in a Public Policy Polling survey of the presidential primary . Nationally , he never wound up exceeding 2 percent in any poll :\nHickenlooper \u2019 s campaign had been struggling for months , so this wasn \u2019 t an unexpected announcement . In early July , six of his top staffers left the campaign after urging him to drop out and run for U.S. Senate in Colorado instead . There was so little grassroots appetite for his candidacy that , four months into his campaign , he had reportedly amassed only 13,000 individual donors ( one-tenth of the required number to qualify for the September debate ) . At the time , an anonymous source said staff told Hicklenlooper his campaign was on pace to run out of money by the end of August , so it \u2019 s possible Hickenlooper simply could not afford to continue his campaign .\nHickenlooper \u2019 s failure is notable because , as a two-term governor of a swing state , he had a great traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a presidential candidate ; it \u2019 s fair to think that if he had run in , say , 1992 , he might very well have become the nominee ( or at least made more of a showing ) . But Hickenlooper \u2019 s fate is another data point suggesting we can throw some of those old priors out the window . Nowadays , it appears more important to many Democratic primary voters that a presidential candidate either has revolutionary ideas , better represents the diversity of the party or both . And former Vice President Joe Biden , perhaps the only candidate with better traditional credentials than Hickenlooper , is sucking up all the oxygen among the remainder of the electorate .\nIndeed , it \u2019 s notable that the candidates to qualify for the September debate so far are Biden and then an array of boundary-breaking candidates \u2014 three women ( Sens . Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar ) , three people of color ( Harris , Sen. Cory Booker and Andrew Yang ) and a gay man ( Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Indiana ) . Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke are the exceptions , but even they have the novelty of democratic socialism and youth , respectively , on their side . The race \u2019 s many straight , moderate and/or older white men look likely to be culled from the debate stage , and we expect some to join Hickenlooper in bowing out of the race . ( Of course , we \u2019 ll have to wait and see \u2014 perhaps some will break out of the pack . )\nThe other notable thing about Hickenlooper \u2019 s departure from presidential politics is the question of what he does next . Many hope he \u2019 ll challenge Republican Sen. Cory Gardner back home in Colorado . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly met with Hickenlooper repeatedly to pressure him into running , and Hickenlooper said in his drop-out video that he will give it \u201c some serious thought . \u201d\nBut with about a dozen Democrats already running in that race , others believe his presidential dalliance has cost him a clear shot at a Senate nomination that would otherwise have been his for the taking . I agree to a point \u2014 it is far from certain that they will all drop out in deference to Hickenlooper . In fact , former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff said on Thursday he would not do so . In addition , former state Sen. Mike Johnston has raised more in total contributions for his Senate campaign ( $ 3.4 million ) than Hickenlooper did for his presidential campaign ( $ 3.2 million ) ! And both Johnston and former diplomat Dan Baer had more cash on hand than Hickenlooper at the end of last quarter , so those two can also probably afford to stand and fight if they want to .\nOn the other hand , I still think Hickenlooper would be strongly favored to win the nomination . His fundraising would almost surely pick up ( and his rivals \u2019 would dry up ) if he sets his sights a little lower . And two hypothetical polls of the race have given Hickenlooper huge leads . The same PPP poll that showed Hickenlooper at 7 percent in the presidential primary put him at 44 percent in the Senate primary , followed by Romanoff at 12 percent . ( None of the six other candidates included in the survey received more than 4 percent . ) And a more recent poll from Garin-Hart-Yang put Hickenlooper at 61 percent , Johnston at 10 percent and Romanoff at 8 percent . One caveat : Both polls were sponsored by unknown Democratic organizations , and they may have a vested interest in tempting Hickenlooper to run for Senate .\nThat \u2019 s because Hickenlooper is widely seen as Democrats \u2019 strongest possible general-election candidate , and Colorado is virtually a must-win for Democrats if they want to take back control of the Senate . According to the Garin-Hart-Yang poll , 61 percent of Democrats think Hickenlooper has the best chance of defeating Gardner in the general election . ( Most respondents said electability was more important than ideology in determining their primary vote \u2014 so , ironically , Hickenlooper could end up essentially becoming the Biden of the Colorado Senate field . )\nThere are reasons to think Hickenlooper would present a particularly strong challenge to Gardner . He \u2019 s already won two statewide elections in Colorado \u2014 and in tough years for Democrats ( 2010 and 2014 ) to boot . And another PPP poll , conducted just last weekend , gave Hickenlooper a strong 13-point lead over Gardner .\nBut personally , I \u2019 m not convinced . Just as early polls of the presidential general election can readily be dismissed , I don \u2019 t think that PPP poll shows us much beyond name recognition . Plus , that poll was sponsored by 314 Action , which definitely has a vested interest in tempting Hickenlooper to run for Senate ( 314 Action is a group that promotes scientists running for office ; Hickenlooper is a former geologist ) .\nAdditionally , Hickenlooper is on record saying he doesn \u2019 t want to be a senator . He has said , \u201c I \u2019 m not cut out to be a senator \u201d and \u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s my calling. \u201d There is even video of him saying \u201c the Senate doesn \u2019 t attract me \u201d and \u201c if the Senate \u2019 s so good , how come all those senators are trying to get out ? \u201d I would expect to see those clips show up in an attack ad or two .\nFinally , in a presidential year , I \u2019 m just not sure any Democrat would perform that much better than another . In this era of partisanship \u00fcber alles , Senate races track very closely with the presidential results in their states . Gardner \u2019 s fate probably hinges on how closely associated he is with President Trump , and Trump \u2019 s standing come Election Day , more than on the quality of his opponent .",
