His impartiality is being questioned because one of his likely chief witnesses , the ousted FBI Director James Comey , is a longtime friend . Others have flagged past campaign contributions from some of Mueller \u2019 s newly appointed prosecutors to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama . A few say the whole probe is a sham and that Mueller should be removed as special counsel .\nThe wave of freelance attacks , which gathered steam over the weekend following Comey \u2019 s dramatic testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee , echoes tactics used by Democrats in the 1990s to undercut special prosecutor Kenneth Starr \u2019 s investigation into the Clinton White House .\n\u201c I think the idea of having an enemy when you \u2019 re the object of a special prosecutor is a very important one , \u201d said Dick Morris , who helped pioneer the anti-Starr strategy as a Clinton adviser but is now a Trump fan .\n\u201c Clinton only survived a special prosecutor because he made Ken Starr the enemy , \u201d Morris added .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
