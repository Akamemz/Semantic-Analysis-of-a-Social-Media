    "content": "President Obama will travel to the Midwest this week to give a major speech about economic revival , bypassing bankrupt Detroit , where he has resisted pleas for a federal bailout .\nThe president will fly Wednesday to Galesburg , Ill. , and Warrensburg , Mo. , to promote his domestic agenda , featuring an address at Knox College in Illinois . White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said in an email Sunday night that the president will \u201c kick off a series of speeches that will lay out his vision for rebuilding an economy that puts the middle class and those fighting to join it front and center . \u201d\nThe speech also will serve as Mr. Obama \u2019 s attempt to regain control of his second term , which has been sidetracked by scandals such as Benghazi , secret surveillance and the abuse of Internal Revenue Service powers .\n\u201c The president thinks Washington has largely taken its eye off the ball on the most important issue facing the country , \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said . \u201c Instead of talking about how to help the middle class , too many in Congress are trying to score political points , refight old battles , and trump up phony scandals . \u201d\nMr. Pfeiffer said the president will outline economic steps that he will take on his own , steps that Congress should take and actions that private industry can accomplish to bolster the economy .
