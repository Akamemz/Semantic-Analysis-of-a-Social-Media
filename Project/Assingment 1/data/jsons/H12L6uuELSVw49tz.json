Bush \u2019 s presidency .\nWhile there will be pushback from isolationist voices in the party \u2019 s libertarian wing , it won \u2019 t take center stage , according to senior Republican congressional advisers who say that after years of standing by while the Obama administration has pursued a \u201c lead from behind \u201d foreign policy , the GOP is now poised to push the White House toward a more decisive leadership posture on the world stage .\n\u201c What we saw Tuesday night was the American people moving the Democrats out of the way , because they certainly haven \u2019 t led on national security , \u201d said one adviser who , like several others , requested anonymity in order to speak candidly . The adviser asserted that a \u201c mandate \u201d has now been established for \u201c Republicans to push certain foreign policy initiatives . \u201d\nAuthorizations to send heavy weapons to Ukrainian forces battling pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine and sophisticated arms to moderate opposition rebels in Syria have \u201c languished on the Senate floor \u201d over the past two years because Majority Leader Harry Reid \u201c wouldn \u2019 t let them through , \u201d said one senior adviser to a key Republican lawmaker .\nThose initiatives \u201c will now go for up-or-down votes , \u201d once Sen. Mitch McConnell assumes the majority leadership post and key committee chairmanships are filled by GOP critics of the Obama administration \u2019 s foreign policy \u2014 such as Sen. John McCain helming the Senate Committee on Armed Services , the adviser said .\nIncreasing aid to Syria \u2019 s rebels is likely to be among the first priorities . Mr. McCain essentially said as much Monday when he issued a statement asserting that \u201c the administration \u2019 s current strategy in Syria is a disaster . \u201d\n\u201c Despite vocal support for moderate opposition fighters in Syria , the administration has continuously failed to match its actions with its rhetoric , providing little meaningful support to those fighting and dying in the battle against [ the Islamic State ] , \u201d said Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican .\nThough more moderate than Mr. McCain , Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee , who is set to head the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , has been deeply critical of President Obama \u2019 s policies , particularly toward Russia .\nFollowing Moscow \u2019 s recognition this week of separatist elections held in eastern Ukraine , Mr. Corker issued a statement that Washington \u201c must work with Europe to continue imposing costs against Russia and reassure our support for Ukraine through stepped-up assistance . \u201d\nWhile the White House already has imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian individuals and entities , the Foreign Relations Committee in September unanimously approved legislation that would expand sanctions on Russia \u2019 s defense , financial and energy industries , as well as provide lethal military and nonmilitary assistance for Ukraine . The bill was co-sponsored by Mr. Corker and the committee \u2019 s current chairman , Sen. Robert Menendez , New Jersey Democrat .\nWhat remains to be seen is how the president will respond to such legislation , which is likely to pass the full Senate .\nMr. McConnell may pave the way for Mr. Corker , Mr. McCain and other GOP foreign policy hawks like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to try to play \u201c back-seat driver \u201d to the White House , but at the end of the day , \u201c if the president doesn \u2019 t want to do what they push for , that \u2019 s entirely up to him , \u201d said one senior congressional aide .\nWith that in mind , another senior aide said the Republicans are unlikely to be able to come up with the 67 votes required to override a presidential veto . \u201c The GOP won \u2019 t have it , \u201d the aide said .\nIt \u2019 s a factor that limits Republicans \u2019 ability to play spoiler if the White House accepts an Iranian nuclear deal that they deem deficient .\n\u201c A GOP-controlled Congress will have more flexibility to have up-or-down votes on things like whether or not to keep up sanctions pressure on Iran , \u201d the aide said . \u201c But the president still has the ability to veto things , and he has the ability to waive such sanctions . \u201d\nSome foreign policy analysts point to such factors as proof that what Republicans really gained Tuesday is control of the bully pulpit .\n\u201c The biggest impact will be the ability of Republicans to make noise , \u201d said Gordon Adams , an international relations professor and U.S. foreign policy analyst at American University .\n\u201c They can influence the atmosphere of debate and , to some degree , put the administration under pressure , \u201d Mr. Adams said . \u201c They can jump up and down and wave their arms , but Congress does not make policy . Actually , policy \u2014 deploying troops , ordering bombing sorties , leveling sanctions \u2014 gets made in the White House . \u201d\nSuch logic hung in the backdrop Wednesday , as Mr. Obama said he is \u201c eager to work with the new Congress \u201d but that lawmakers can be trusted to \u201c pass some bills I can not sign . \u201d\nMr. Obama did suggest he is well aware of coming Republican pressure for him to clarify his strategy for defeating the Islamic State , also known as ISIL and ISIS .\nApparently wary of GOP criticism that he reached beyond his executive authority in September by opening a bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and in Syria , the president said he intends to move quickly to engage the new Congress \u201c over a new authorization to use military forces against ISIL . \u201d\nSuch engagement is likely to prove tricky over the coming year . But there is one foreign policy matter on which the White House and a Republican-controlled Senate may see eye to eye quickly .\nCongressional advisers say the GOP-led Senate is poised to move quickly on reinvigorating stalled efforts to achieve a Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) \u2014 two massive free trade deals that Mr. Obama has consistently voiced support for during recent years .\nAt issue is the so-called \u201c trade promotion authority , \u201d which would allow the White House to negotiate the final terms of the two deals without having to allow Congress to debate the terms and add amendments . The president has pushed for Congress to provide such authority \u2014 arguing that it is essential to winning concessions from other nations in order to finalize the trade deals .\nBut Mr. Reid , yielding to labor unions that oppose the deals , opposed the White House on the issue early this year , making it clear that as long as he was Senate majority leader , there would be no up-or-down vote on whether to give such authority to the president .\nSome foreign policy analysts believe Republicans are eager to push such a vote now since it would will be a \u201c win-win \u201d for them , because Democrats are divided on the issue .\nOn the one hand , the White House will be under pressure to accept the new authority as a GOP olive branch on foreign policy ; on the other , Mr. Obama is likely to be lambasted for it by key players in his own Democratic base .\n\u201c The president has found his greatest resistance on free trade is from Democrats , not Republicans , \u201d said Doug Bandow , a senior fellow specializing in foreign policy at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute . At the same time , \u201c this issue presents the GOP with a place to demonstrate they \u2019 re willing to work with the administration on something . \u201d\nSeparately , Mr. Bandow suggested that while \u201c some libertarian sorts like [ Sen. ] Rand Paul will obviously resist , \u201d most Republicans will unite behind the party \u2019 s hawks on other foreign policy initiatives \u2014 particularly because of a sense that the White House will veto anything truly interventionist that arrives from the new Senate .\n\u201c Whether the issue is ISIS or Ukraine , I think they should be considered cheap votes , but Republicans will get behind them because they know they will embarrass the president and Democratic members of Congress , \u201d Mr. Bandow said .\nOthers say there \u2019 s reason to be skeptical about the prospects of Republican unity behind a hawkish foreign policy platform in the Senate in the year ahead .\n\u201c The architecture that existed for Republicans in the previous decade under George W.
