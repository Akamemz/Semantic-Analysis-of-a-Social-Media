But his district , which includes the liberal northern suburbs of San Francisco and the marijuana-growing region of Humboldt County , is likely to back rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) .\n\u201c I really don \u2019 t like the superdelegate system , \u201d Huffman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I \u2019 d just like to let voters vote and decide who wins and loses . I \u2019 m kind of old-fashioned that way . But what I have promised everyone is that I \u2019 m not trying to rig this election as an insider somehow in the Democratic Party in a way that overrides the voters . I \u2019 m not going to do that .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to go to the convention and cook the books , or rig an outcome , \u201d the San Rafael-based Democrat continued . \u201c What I \u2019 m going to do is follow what the voters of this country do in the primaries and the caucuses . There has never been an election where a superdelegate has decided the nominee . I don \u2019 t think this is going to be the first , so I hope everyone kind of calms down a little on the superdelegate issue . \u201d\nIn a fundraising speech to roughly 120 supporters at the rustic Bayside Grange event hall in this unincorporated community in Humboldt County , Huffman appealed to party unity . He ripped Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump and bemoaned what he called a \u201c crass , \u201d \u201c juvenile \u201d and \u201c depressing \u201d election season .\nHuffman also warned that the makeup of the Supreme Court is \u201c hanging in the balance , \u201d along with its attendant decisions on abortion , campaign finance reform and climate change .\n\u201c There are fundamental different directions this country will take depending on the outcome of this election , \u201d Huffman said .\nThink about , for a moment , what a President Donald Trump would look like . I know that \u2019 s kind of painful , but just imagine for a moment the division and the conflict that would come , in addition to all of those policy choices that we would lose out on . Imagine the loss of our credibility all over the world , think about that , and the chaos that would ensue . This is a guy who says his foreign policy strategy is to be \u2018 unpredictable. \u2019 What could go wrong ? He \u2019 s a guy who says , \u2018 Maybe we should give nuclear weapons to Japan and South Korea , then we won \u2019 t have to spend so much money defending them ; \u2019 \u2018 Maybe we should get rid of NATO ; \u2019 \u2018 We definitely ought to bring back torture. \u2019 This is the Donald Trump foreign policy platform . And I think it \u2019 s pretty scary to imagine what would happen to our country if this was our commander-in-chief . So as hard as it is to imagine that , it \u2019 s also important to know that this is kind of a golden opportunity for us in this year \u2019 s election . We have an opportunity to make this an absolute landslide for Democrats . Whether you \u2019 re with Hillary or Bernie , this is the big one . Because Ted Cruz ain \u2019 t much better than Donald Trump . In fact , in some ways , he \u2019 s even worse . We have got to get out there and win this . \u201d\nHuffman also sought to reassure a wary progressive constituency about the Democratic Party \u2019 s superdelegate system , in which members of Congress and party officials are free to vote for whomever they choose in the primary , regardless of the results of the primary in their state . Currently , Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead in delegates chosen by the electorate , but a wide lead in superdelegates .\nEarlier in his speech , Huffman \u2014 a ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources , and a longtime advocate for the state \u2019 s politically powerful but controversial environmental interests\u2014 criticized the Westlands Water District of the Central Valley for what he called \u201c bad ideas that are designed to take away our water . \u201d\nLast week , Huffman and several other California House Democrats called for congressional hearings into the Central Valley water agency \u2019 s recent settlement with the federal government over drainage for its farms .\n\u201c Those Central Valley salmon runs are really the staple of the whole commercial fishing industry when it comes to salmon , and they \u2019 re under continuous attack by folks like the Westlands Water District , \u201d Huffman said .\n\u201c Right now , as we sit here , they \u2019 re suing to try to take away Humboldt County \u2019 s water right on the Trinity River . And it \u2019 s just nonstop . Every year , when we \u2019 ve fought to release cold flow just in time to avoid a massive fish kill on the lower Klamath River , they have gone to court and attempted to stop that water from flowing into the river and keeping these fish alive . So we are constantly fighting against these bad ideas , \u201d he added .\nReached by phone late Saturday night , Westlands Water District deputy general manager Johnny Amaral told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c there is way more to the Trinity River issue than [ Huffman ] is letting on . \u201d\n\u201c We have and will continue to fight the needless waste of water anywhere in the state , \u201d Amaral said . \u201c It \u2019 s ironic and ridiculous that Huffman and his bosses in the environmental movement are always quick to drone on and on about conservation , and that \u2018 farmers need to be more efficient. \u2019 Yet when they demand 90,000 acre-feet of water be released for salmon on the Trinity River , or that the people of the state of California get starved of water for some smelt , all of a sudden they forget what the word \u2018 waste \u2019 means . Billions of gallons flushed to the ocean to protect fish , while kids soccer fields \u2019 go dry up and down the state , and the fish are no better off for it . \u201d\n\u201c What was on the menu tonight [ at the Huffman event ] ? \u201d Amaral added . \u201c Salad ? Vegetables ? Fruit ? Meats ? Nuts ? All of it came from farmers in the Westlands Water District . A thank-you would have been sufficient . \u201d",
