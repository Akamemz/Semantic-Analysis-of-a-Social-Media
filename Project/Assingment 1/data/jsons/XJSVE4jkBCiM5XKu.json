But if you haven\u2019t been following closely, this visual story should help you get a better understanding of how this process works \u2014 and how the Trump administration is justifying it.\n\n1) The initial process for asylum seekers\n\nLet\u2019s say you and your child are from Honduras, among the world\u2019s deadliest nations that aren\u2019t at war.\n\nLike thousands of other families, largely from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, you take the dangerous journey north to the US-Mexico border.\n\nYou could go to a US port of entry \u2014 like a border checkpoint \u2014 and claim asylum, which is legal.

You say yes. An official then interviews you to make sure you have \u201ccredible fear\u201d if sent back. This is to determine whether you are eligible to go in front of a judge and seek asylum.
