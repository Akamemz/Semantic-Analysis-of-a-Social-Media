    "title": "Memo to George Soros and Charles Koch: Fund Campus Debates",
    "date": "",
    "authors": "",
    "content": "At the invitation of Matt Denhart , president of the Coolidge Foundation , I spent an extraordinary day recently speaking to students participating in a Coolidge high school and middle school ( ! ) debate tournament in Raleigh , North Carolina . I watched some students evaluate whether the benefits of attending college exceed the costs . It was a marvelous learning experience for the participants , and led to a civil but spirited discussion of one of the issues of our day . Bob Luddy , the founder of CaptiveAire Systems , a manufacturer of kitchen ventilation systems , largely financed the event , and his North Carolina efforts led me to think that maybe two extremely wealthy entrepreneurs , George Soros and Charles Koch , could fund a large number of debates involving prominent public intellectuals at the national level , both to encourage collegiate debate but , far more importantly , to introduce more diversity of ideas and civility into discussion of those ideas on campuses . Both gentlemen have shown an interest in open discussion of the issues . The Charles Koch Foundation sponsors educational programs at many universities , and the Soros Open Society Foundations likewise promotes debates ( this author himself participated in a debate once in Mr. Soros\u0092 New York apartment ) .\nSuppose Soros and Koch each contributed $ 50 million to fund a new Collegiate Debate Initiative for three years . The Debate Initiative\u0092s board might consist of two members selected by George Soros , two by Charles Koch , and a chair and perhaps others selected by those four , preferably well regarded national figures not extremely partisan or ideological . The initiative would give $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 each year to to fund a series of debates on about 200 campuses ( probably about two each semester ) on issues of the day . Should the U.S. drop out of the Paris climate change accord ? Should we raise tariffs on Chinese goods ? Should we liberalize immigration to the U.S. ? Should we have \u0093free\u0094 college ? Should we have a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution ? Should we ban gasoline-powered automobiles in 10 years ? For each debate , a liberal/progressive/socialist speaker would be invited , along with a conservative/libertarian one . For example , Jordan Peterson or Charles Murray might debate Paul Krugman or Thomas Piketty .\nThese debates would achieve multiple objectives . First , they would provide much needed intellectual diversity on many campuses where most faculty have similar ( typically progressive left ) perspectives . Second , they would demonstrate the utility of civility and orderly discussion in assessing issues of the day . Third , on many campuses , they would expose students and faculty to first-rate minds that normally would not be seen . Fourth , the value of debate as a learning tool might become greater appreciated as they become more common on campuses . Fifth , debates help demonstrate the importance of freedom of expression and the First Amendment in both learning and in strengthening representative democracy .\nIn addition to the campus-wide debates featuring prominent public intellectuals , some funds could be used to fund student debate efforts . Perhaps a debating league could be created between schools , where teams of debaters could compete against other teams debating a variety of issues . Ultimately , the Koch-Soros initiative could fund national debate tournaments . Collegiate debating already exists , of course , but this might expand it and make it part of more student lives .\nI would envision the initiative encompassing perhaps the largest 50 schools in the U.S. by enrollment , perhaps the 50 most prominent schools as determined by reputation and perhaps another 100 schools selected randomly from a list of all accredited institutions with at least 1,000 students . One problem probably arising relates to attempts on some campuses to prohibit public campus presentations on the grounds that outsiders ( in this case Koch-Soros Initiative people ) organized them . There are different ways to overcome this : use off-campus facilities ( as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute did in dealing with Gonzaga University ) , bribe the schools with nice sized \u0093rental\u0094 payments , etc . Perhaps the colleges could be allowed to choose between alternative debate topics . Perhaps local campus individuals could be involved in introducing speakers or moderating the debates . Audiences could be polled before and after the debates to ascertain their positions on the debate question , and evaluate who \u0093won\u0094 the debate . If successful , hopefully , the debates could be put on a permanent , possibly even endowed basis involving financial support from a broader base of contributors .",
