    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump sought the open arms of Twitter and Fox News to creatively explain away inconvenient facts about his legal peril and his promised border wall before GOP senators dragged him back to reality with a rebuke from his own party for ignoring a cold-blooded murder OK 'd by a foreign colleague .\nIn Trump 's universe , Mexico is already paying for the wall . And the crimes for which Michael Cohen is going to jail are n't crimes after all ; they were added to his rap sheet by prosecutors as a dig at Trump\nBut alternative facts , to borrow the phrase coined by White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to reject facts they reject without evidence , only go so far . Trump learned their limits Thursday afternoon when Republican senators lobbed at him a resolution condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi .\nTrump had ignored the clear conclusion of the CIA that bin Salman was involved in the killing when he issued an exclamation point-laden official statementlast month that it was unproven that Saudi Arabia and its crown prince were complicit . It would n't matter anyway , the President said , since Saudi Arabia is buying US military equipment .\nNow senators have slapped him on the wrist with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker 's resolution , passed by voice vote . They more narrowly voted to restricted US support for Saudi Arabia 's war in Yemen .\nMeanwhile , he still has to deal with Congress over the federal budget .\nAnd CNN reported late Thursday that Trump had been in the room when hush payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with him were discussed by Cohen and David Pecker , whose company publishes the National Enquirer .\nA new way for Mexico to pay for the wall\nTrump wo n't have much time to seethe at his allies in the Senate if he wants to keep the government up and running through the holidays .\nAfter a televised chess match in which he had declared he 'd be proud to shut down the government if Congress would n't give him funding for his border wall and border security left him in check , the President opened the door to a change of course Thursday when he argued Mexico was already paying for the wall through the trade agreement he 's pushing to replace NAFTA .\n`` I often stated , 'One way or the other , Mexico is going to pay for the Wall , ' `` Trump said on Twitter . `` This has never changed . Our new deal with Mexico ( and Canada ) , the USMCA , is so much better than the old , very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal , that just by the money we save , MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL !

He ticked through possible revenue from a trade deal -- either directly through higher tariffs or indirectly via tax revenue from increased economic activity . There 's nothing to suggest the USMCA will land the government a windfall on either count .\nEven if Mexico did start pumping money into the USMCA after it passes , Levy said , that does n't mean it would go to the wall .\n`` There 's nothing that earmarks this type of money for a wall , '' he said . `` Your income taxes or corporate taxes -- they go into general revenue .

Now , those people have been abandoned during the spending negotiations .\nInstead , the issue is the $ 5 billion Trump wants to beef up border security and start building his long-promised wall on the Mexico border . His tweet that Mexico would pay through the USMCA was n't an entirely new argument , but -- timed immediately after he promised a shutdown -- it felt like the beginning of an out before parts of the government run out of money December 21 -- the same day Trump could get out of the White House and travel down to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas .\nThe public largely takes the Democratic side on the wall , according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , in which 57 % of Americans said they 're against a wall , compared with 38 % in favor . Those numbers are similar to where they were just after Trump took office in 2017 . Most who favor the wall say they would continue to do so even if all the funding for it came from the US rather than from Mexico , according to Jennifer Agiesta , CNN 's polling director .\nJUST WATCHED Trump : Never told Cohen to do anything wrong Replay More Videos ...
