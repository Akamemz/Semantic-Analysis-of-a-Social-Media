    "content": "( CNN ) The second Dallas health care worker who was found to have the Ebola virus should not have boarded a commercial jet Monday , health officials say .\nBecause she had helped care for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan , and because another health worker who cared for Duncan had been diagnosed with Ebola , the worker was not allowed to travel on a commercial plane with other people , said Dr. Tom Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nThe worker had a temperature of 99.5 Fahrenheit ( 37.5 Celsius ) before she boarded her flight , he added .\nHealth care workers who had been exposed to Duncan were undergoing self-monitoring . They were allowed to travel but not on a commercial plane with other people , Frieden said .\nMoving forward , the CDC will ensure that no one else in such a situation travels outside of a closed environment , he said .\nThe worker is Amber Vinson , 29 , a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas . She was confirmed to have Ebola overnight . Now , she will be transferred from the Dallas hospital to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta , which has successfully treated two other patients . It is now treating a third : a male health care worker who was infected in Sierra Leone .\nThe first Dallas health care worker with Ebola , Nina Pham , is in `` improved condition , '' Frieden said . It has not been determined whether she will be transferred to another facility .\nBoth Dallas health workers had `` extensive contact '' with Duncan on October 28-30 , when he had `` extensive production of body fluids '' such as vomit and diarrhea , Frieden told reporters in a conference call .\nThe risk of exposure to the passengers who were on the plane with Vinson is low , since she did not yet have symptoms , health officials said Wednesday . The Ebola virus is not contagious before symptoms set in .\nStill , the CDC wants to interview all 132 passengers who were on the plane with her .\n`` Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning , CDC is reaching out to passengers who flew on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth Oct. 13 , '' the CDC said in a statement . The flight landed Monday at 8:16 p.m. CT .\nThe woman `` exhibited no symptoms or sign of illness while on Flight 1143 , according to the crew , '' Frontier Airlines said in a statement .\nEarlier , Vinson flew from Dallas-Fort Worth to Cleveland on Frontier Flight 1142 on October 10 .\nThe airline said customers who may have traveled on either flight should contact the CDC at 1-800-CDC-INFO ( 1-800-232-4636 ) . But the CDC statement , contained in the same news release , said the CDC wanted to speak only with passengers of the October 13 flight . The CDC later confirmed to CNN that it is `` only interested '' in the passengers on Flight 1143 .\nThe October 13 flight was cleaned thoroughly after it landed , `` per our normal procedures which is consistent with CDC guidelines , '' the airline said . After the airline was informed of the Ebola patient , the plane was removed from service .\nIn a sign of growing concerns about Ebola , President Obama canceled trips to New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday to convene a meeting at the White House of Cabinet agencies coordinating the government 's response to the outbreak .\nVinson , who lives alone , is in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital .\nThe news that she contracted Ebola cast further doubt on the hospital 's ability to handle the virus and protect employees .\nIt 's the same hospital that initially sent Thomas Eric Duncan home , even though he had a fever and had traveled from West Africa . By the time he returned to the hospital , his symptoms had worsened . He died while being treated by medical staff , including the two women who have now contracted the disease .\n`` I do n't think we have a systematic institutional problem , '' Dr. Daniel Varga , chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources , told reporters Wednesday , facing questions about the hospital 's actions .\nJUST WATCHED Air airport precautions effective ?
