    "content": "The study of logical and rhetorical fallacies dates back to the ancient Greeks , but for all that studying , we 're still overrun by them\u2014and for understandable reasons . Most fallacies derive from valid rules-of-thumb that are deeply ingrained in our thinking , but are hastily applied , or taken to be conclusive , rather than a good starting point . There are cases when there are only two choices to be had\u2014but not always . In that case , it 's the \u201c false dilemma \u201d or \u201c false dichotomy \u201d fallacy . It 's valid to note that cause precedes effect , and to look for causes accordingly , to take another example . But it 's the \u201c rooster fallacy \u201d ( aka post hoc ergo proctor hoc ) to assume that the rooster crowing caused the sun to rise . It 's the very utility of the underlying rules-of-thumb that makes fallacies so hard for us to shake .\nFallacies pop up all the time in the course of specific arguments , but the most broadly damaging ones can shape an entire realm of public discourse . Two such fallacies are at war in American politics today , and they 're making progress extremely hard to come by . They were at work in the recent government shutdown , and they have n't gone anywhere in its aftermath , either .\nFallacy No . 1 is the false balance fallacy\u2014also known as false compromise , argument to moderation ( `` argumentum ad temperantiam '' in Latin ) , and the golden mean fallacy , among others . It is a major feature of our so-called serious politicians and media figures , who routinely position themselves in between \u201c extremists on both sides. \u201d It 's often the case that two people in an argument each miss something valid in each other 's point of view . So there 's a valid rule-of-thumb here in trying to see both sides . But it becomes a fallacy when this starting point becomes the end , particularly when balance or moderation becomes so important that it 's rigidly , even fanatically adhered to , and the clear preponderance of evidence is given no more weight than someone 's uninformed opinion . As Cenk Uygur put it , `` If CNN did sports reporting , every game would be a tie . ''\nFallacy No . 2 is the \u201c no true Scotsman \u201d fallacy . Unlike most fallacies , it does n't derive from a valid rule-of-thumb , though it is connected to some more benign cognitive impulses . Typically , A says , `` No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge . '' B replies , `` I am Scottish , and put sugar on my porridge . '' A responds : `` Ah , then you are not a true Scotsman . '' This fallacy commonly involves attempts to preserve purity\u2014as when Tea Party conservatives denounced those willing to compromise on shutting down the government as not being \u201c true conservatives. \u201d Appeals to purity can arise anywhere on the political spectrum , but for a variety of reasons they tend to be much more common on the right .\nLet 's look a little more closely at each of these fallacies in turn .\nThe false balance fallacy lay at the heart of the media 's deep reluctance to blame conservative Republicans for the recent government shutdown . As I recently wrote for Al Jazeera English , the media had to ignore nine bodies of evidence that clearly showed it was Republicans , not Democrats , who caused the shutdown . Thus , instead of reporting as much context and as many perspectives as possible , the media 's embrace of false balance severely constricts the range of facts and viewpoints it explores\u2014the exact opposite of what it 's supposedly trying to achieve .\nPresident Obama is a walking embodiment of this fallacy . He is so eager to embrace Republican ideas\u2014 Bush 's TARP , tax cuts in his stimulus bill , the Heritage Foundation 's individual mandate , \u201d `` cap and trade , \u201d fiscal austerity , making permanent the vast majority of Bush 's tax cuts , etc.\u2014that he embraces objectively bad ideas , divides his own base , and does n't even get any political benefit from it . For one thing , he does n't give Republicans an opportunity to fight for their own ideas\u2014to demonstrate to their own base that they stand for something that is in dispute . Rather than make them more willing to compromise with him , this increases the pressure on them to fight . We 've seen this over and over again throughout the Obama presidency , but Obama never seems to learn . His very zeal in seeking compromise only makes it that much harder for Republicans who need to fight him . So it 's really not all that surprising when they turn around and accuse him of being \u201c unwilling to negotiate , \u201d however misleading that may be . Whatever else is involved in keeping Obama stuck where he is , the false balance fallacy is part of the equation .\nThe flip side of the false balance fallacy is the false dichotomy mentioned earlier\u2014the assumption that there is no middle ground , and there are only two sides . \u201c You 're either with us or against us , \u201d as George Bush said . In America today , however , these two fallacies work hand-in-hand . Condemning \u201c extremists on both sides \u201d is an integral part of maintaining the \u201c balanced \u201d \u201c moderate \u201d center . But this condemnation in defense of false balance depends on a false dichotomy\u2014extremists vs. moderates .\nOn the other hand , false dichotomy also works together with the \u201c no true Scotsman \u201d fallacy . You need the false dichotomy fallacy to form the \u201c true Scotsman \u201d notion in the first place .\nThe underlying logic here is , in a sense , the exact opposite of the balance fallacy : It 's better not to hear both sides , it 's better not to even think there 's another side . Psychologist Jonathan Haidt cites substantial evidence that conservatives are much more concerned about purity ( aka sanctity ) than liberals are . ( Haidt thinks this is a liberal deficiency , I tend to disagree . ) So it 's not that surprising that purity is a much bigger concern among conservatives than it is among liberals .\nThe fallacy has several major manifestations . The broadest of those is perfectly captured in the title of a 2009 post by John Cole at Balloon Juice : `` Conservatism Can not Fail , Only We Can Fail Conservatism. \u201d In it , he asks :\n[ D ] o you remember all the mass protests organized by Freedom Works and the fiscal conservative teabaggers when Bush and DeLay were jamming through the Prescription Drug bill ? You remember 60-100,000 wingnuts descending on D.C. screaming \u201c I want my country back ? \u201d while wailing about out of control spending ? Me either . \u201d\nAnd he 's hardly alone when he concludes by saying , `` I \u2019 ve said it before , and I \u2019 ll say it again- these 'conservatives ' sound like the excuse makers for the Soviet Union who tell us communism didn \u2019 t fail , it just wasn \u2019 t properly implemented . ''\nWhat Soviet Communism and U.S. conservatism share in common is the \u201c no true Scotsman \u201d logic , which dismisses all their failings , rather than learning from them , treating them as the fault of impurities , outside intrusions , or insufficient commitment by the community of true believers . In both cases , this logic is absolutely deadly . It scarcely matters whether either the Communists or the conservatives originally had any valid insights or ideas or not\u2014their embrace of the \u201c no true Scotsman \u201d fallacy made it impossible for them to improve on what they started with , impossible to learn from their mistakes .\nIn the course of the budget shutdown crisis , there was a layering effect as the media struck a false balance between Democrats and Republicans , while Democrats also adopted a balance-based pose , arguing repeatedly that they were just being reasonable and the Republicans were being extreme . Of course , what the Democrats were saying was n't false at all . But they were so concerned with being \u201c on message \u201d that they did n't want to get into the messy details\u2014the empirical facts that are utterly essential is you want to make a valid argument based on facts , rather than a specious argument based on assertion .\nIt 's not as if there were only two choices here\u2014no false dichotomy ! They could have struck some sort of middle ground balance with a disciplined presentation of facts , such as endlessly repeating , \u201c The budget level in the CR is already a compromise\u2014it gives House Republicans 90 percent of what they want. \u201d One thing they would apparently never consider was bringing their own independent ideas to the fore\u2014such as raising the cap on payroll taxes to secure Social Security indefinitely . The balance ethos was so deeply internalized that only conservative ideas got a hearing , even as conservatives were losing badly . And so those ideas remain dominant , despite everything there is to discredit them .\nCase in point : Now that the shutdown crisis is over , talk of a \u201c grand bargain \u201d has begun again , implicitly including Obama 's willingness to cut Social Security and Medicare ( \u201c in order to save it , \u201d just like George Bush and Paul Ryan ! ) as part of a \u201c balanced approach \u201d \u2014a phrase he uses constantly . \u201c The challenge we have right now are not short-term deficits . It 's the long-term obligations that we have around things like Medicare and Social Security . We want to make sure those are there for future generations , \u201d Obama said , with no mention of raising taxes on the super-wealthy to help do it .\nThus it is that the \u201c center-left \u201d comes out as center-right\u2014but never anywhere near right enough for conservatives to stop yelling \u201c socialist ! \u201d As long as the logic of fallacies dominates , no amount of factual details matter\u2014much less any sophisticated arguments based on them .\nThese two warring fallacies are flip sides of one another . The false balance fallacy assumed it 's better to hear both sides\u2014even if one side is fact free and deceitful . As a purity mechanism , the Scotsman fallacy has the exact opposite underlying logic : it 's better not to hear both sides , it 's better not to even think there 's another side .\nBoth fallacies are wrong , and both are dangerous\u2014but not equally so . The `` no true Scotsman '' fallacy creates a vicious cycle\u2014anything that would argue against it gets rejected as impure . Thus , we have Tea Party true believers denouncing those who failed to fight to the bitter end , as well as that old standby , blaming the \u201c liberal media. \u201d The `` false balance '' has an inkling of a way out\u2014if enough pressure is brought to bear to force another point of view to be balanced .\nThis is what gay rights activists have been able to do over the past few years\u2014both in terms of marriage equality and in ending \u201c do n't ask , do n't tell. \u201d It 's what immigration activists are struggling mightily to do as well . And it 's what progressives need to do now to fight against Obama and the D.C. establishment sliding back into `` grand bargain '' mode . To do that , progressives will have to be willing to come in for a heavy dose of being labeled \u201c extremist \u201d and being compared to the Tea Party . It 's not that they should go out of their way to invite this . They just should n't duck when the knee-jerk false-equivalence attacks begin . They should be prepared to counterpunch . Hard .",
