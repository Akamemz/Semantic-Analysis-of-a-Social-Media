On Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade hosted former health insurance agent C. Edmund Wright , who claimed that the Obama administration was harming individuals by not allowing them to keep their insurance policies indefinitely , and claimed that President Obama 's decision to allow insurance companies to extend current plans an additional year amounted to a \u201c one-year death sentence \u201d :\nKILMEADE : Edmund , first off , the president is going to meet with insurance executives today and urge them to reinstate those who have been canceled for a year . Why is n't this good politics ? Why is n't this a good move ? WRIGHT : Well , as I said in the article Brian , and good morning , you know , what he said was you can keep your policy if you like it for , you know , four years , leading into recently . And , what you can really do now with his fix is just rent it , or borrow it , or lease it . KILMEADE : For a year . WRIGHT : Right , for one year . It 's like , okay , we 're canceling the new coke and you can have coke classic but only for a year . It 's just an absurd fix . It did n't fix his promise . I think he used the word you can keep it , period . Well , keep it period is not one year . Keep it period means as long as you want it . So he did n't fix his promise nor did he fix the underlying insurance problem because a one-year death sentence on an insurance policy , Brian , that just guarantees that insurers and customers are going to go after each other as hard as they can . We all know people who , you know , brag about screwing their insurance company and we all know people who , you know , get that treatment from the insurance company .

[ ... ] Under the change that the administration is announcing this morning , the hypothetical Americans with a policy that ends in June 2014 would have the option to renew that same plan for one more year , if their insurance company decides to provide that option . Keep in mind , this change is not ordering insurers to offer their products for another year ; health plans regularly take their offerings on and off the market . Instead , it 's a very nice ask on the part of the administration , to insurance carriers and regulators , to play ball on this one . Insurers who do take the White House up on this option would have to do two things : notify consumers of the various health law benefits missing from the plan , and let them know about the other options they would have on the health law 's marketplace .
