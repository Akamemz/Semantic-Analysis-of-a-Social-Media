    "content": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com .\n\u201c Everything \u2019 s fine , \u201d smiled Captain Paul Ryan smarmily as he steered the Titanic into an iceberg . \u201c Now , let me get back to shafting our own voting base via my incomprehensible determination to cancel the tax deductions that Republicans use instead of cutting handouts to Democrat-voting freeloaders ! \u201d\nWe are sailing toward disaster in 2018 and no one seems to want to acknowledge it . Let \u2019 s look at the facts and evidence .\nData Point One : We scraped by in a couple of House special elections so far , including Punchy McSlugahack \u2019 s in Montana , but that Daily Kos reader-funded-12-year old non-resident Democrat dork is going to beat the charisma-free Republican in the Georgia 6 race next week . Our enemy is motivated and smells blood .\nData Point Two : Because she is a droning non-performer , Theresa May took a 24 point advantage and turned it into a loss in Britain .\nData Point Three : Our GOP Republican legislators are droning non-performers who have a 10 point disadvantage going into 2018 .\nThe bottom line is that despite the GOP \u2019 s advantages in incumbency , money , and ( to a much smaller extent than the lying liberals say ) redistricting , we have a very real chance of losing the House and maybe even the Senate in 2018 . The Senate would be hard to lose based simply on number of seats in play , but we should have confidence in our party \u2019 s unique ability to screw-up and fail based on its unblemished track record of screwing up and failing .\nMidterms traditionally go badly for the party holding the White House ; it doesn \u2019 t help that Paul Ryan seems to be the Speaker of a House of Representatives on a different planet . He wanders about with this obnoxious , Comey-esque sanctimony vibe that demoralizes the base and ensures that we will stay home in large numbers while the pinkos turn out en masse . Mitch McConnell is a little better ; he \u2019 s at least cunning and does what he can in a job that involves not just herding cats , but herding senile , narcissistic , and stupid cats .\n\u201c But stuff is getting done ! \u201d the GOP leadership insists , which might be true but is definitely irrelevant . It doesn \u2019 t matter if \u201c stuff is getting done \u201d if your voters don \u2019 t know it and support you . Now , when Paul Ryan talks directly to us on Hugh Hewitt 's show or elsewhere , he actually makes sense . He explains his strategy , so we can sigh \u201c Oh , there \u2019 s a reason for all this and a coherent plan . Phew. \u201d But then Ryan says something unbelievably stupid along the lines of , \u201c As Speaker , my job is to pass legislation , not to go out and sell our agenda to voters. \u201d No , that \u2019 s a steaming pile of Harry Reid .\nThe Speaker has multiple jobs , but they all boil down to winning . The Speaker \u2019 s job is not simply to be some goofy legislative super wonk . He needs to lead , which means getting us onboard as well as his caucus . And that means making sure we voters know what \u2019 s happening , why , and how it helps us . Yet the GOP fails to do that .\nStop failing . Start doing what we sent you to do and letting us in on the plan . Let us see you are intent on winning and you \u2019 ll start to rebuild the confidence your incompetence has shattered .\nHere \u2019 s a good idea for a first step \u2013 work as hard as we do . Let \u2019 s see some late-night sessions . Let \u2019 s see some five day work weeks \u2013 and even some working on weekends . We work weekends . I work weekends . I \u2019 m writing this on a weekend . Why not you ?\nAnd let \u2019 s see you cancel the August recess . Work . We keep hearing about how you \u201c don \u2019 t have time \u201d to do your jobs , but then you propose to vanish in August ? Hey , how about staying around that sticky , sweaty swamp of a city through August and getting your job done ? I \u2019 m going to be working in August . Everyone else I know is going to be working in August . You bums need to work during August too .\nAnd no , you don \u2019 t need to \u201c come home to touch base with your voters. \u201d We don \u2019 t want to see you here . We want to see you back in D.C. , enacting the agenda we elected you to enact instead of chillin \u2019 out at your crib and attending town halls filled with paid leftist shills where you tell us that you don \u2019 t have time to do what you \u2019 re being paid to do .\nYou must get the President \u2019 s agenda passed , but , at the same time , you must keep us in the loop . See , we don \u2019 t trust you . You haven \u2019 t earned our trust . We know you hate the idea that we are going to hold you accountable for what you do and fail to do and you don \u2019 t like it . Too bad . Because now we \u2019 re watching , so you better communicate with us to explain what we see and why it \u2019 s not surrender or failure . As the hep kidz say , we \u2019 re woke .\nThe enemy is motivated and energized , but right now , we \u2019 re \u201c Meh. \u201d The only way we will become un-meh is via results , and results aren \u2019 t merely passing legislation . \u201c Results \u201d means \u201c a tangible improvement in our lives. \u201d Because the situation out here is getting worse . Our country faces the terrifyingly real chance of falling apart if you fail \u2013 during the few minutes a day when you are not busy enacting the President \u2019 s agenda you should be reading my new novel about what might happen to our country if you keep failing .\nSo stop wasting time and effort cavorting with the Democrats about their fake Trump/Russia obsession . Those crusty senators with their \u201c We must uncover the truth about these questions \u201d nonsense need to stop . We all know the truth . It \u2019 s all a liberal lie .\nOh , and how about recruiting some decent GOP candidates ? Karen Handel seems like a nice lady , but she 's lousy at politics so she never should have gotten in the race . Her upcoming loss is going to motivate our enemies , and we ca n't have that . We don \u2019 t have the luxury of letting nice people who are crummy candidates be our nominees . We need winners , not losers .\nThe Democrats are out there recruiting military vets \u2013 there \u2019 s one jerky liberal everyone finds annoying in every big unit , and that \u2019 s who they pick . They \u2019 ll preen and pose and get elected and then salute General Pelosi and vote as ordered on every item of Democrat soldier-shafting liberal hackery . That \u2019 s the threat \u2013 are you ready for it ? You need to spend some time and effort on candidate selection and grooming ; you need to make sure that in every district our money is on a winner . Are you doing that ? Who is doing that ? Why do none of us know about how you are doing that ?\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate , which leads to a failure to win .\nAnd we need to stop jamming our own voters in the name of some arbitrary , D.C. think tank g-generated conception of good policy . Good policy is what wins . How about not imposing anything upon us that hurts the GOP base ? You see , you 're there to represent Republicans . Some goofs and wusscons have the idea that you 're there to represent all voters , but that 's nonsense .\nYou are there to represent the people who voted for you , not the liberal whiners and welfare cheats who did n't and who hate you and us . So we 're not going to close off deductions that help Republicans and we 're not going to increase taxes on Republicans and we 're not gon na do other things that hurt Republicans . We 're going to hurt Democrats .\nIf you do , we win . If the economy is cranking in November 2018 and health insurance premiums are under control \u2013 and they will be if you keep your promises \u2013 then you \u2019 re fine . Otherwise , you \u2019 re gone . People here \u2013 like in Britain \u2013 will vote against you just because you are the status quo if they feel the status quo stinks . So stop the stinking .\nStart by announcing that you are staying in session through your ( undeserved ) August vacation , then deliver on your promises . Nothing else matters . Stop procrastinating . Stop chasing Putin squirrels like suckers . Choose to win .\nThe iceberg is right ahead \u2013 don \u2019 t slam into it .",
