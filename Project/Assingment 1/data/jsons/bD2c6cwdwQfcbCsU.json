He said it felt good to be earning $ 11.23 an hour , even if the new job entailed cutting off necks and pulling out guts on a seemingly endless conveyor of carcasses . It was about $ 4 better , he said , than what he used to earn at a Madison County cookie factory . \u2026 \u2026 the opportunity to earn more than $ 11 an hour can still turn heads in this part of Mississippi . Mr. Grant was not the only person to jump at the chance the raids provided .

Carhops at this Sonic make $ 4.25 an hour \u2014 three dollars less than the state \u2019 s minimum wage \u2014 plus tips , she said .\nBut the NYT \u2019 s reporter dismissed the economic gains for working-class Americans , with a quote from a press release issued by the University of Pennsylvania :\nA 2016 study on the effects of immigration on the United States economy found that immigration had \u201c little long run effect \u201d on American wages .\nBut the university group admitted in 2017 that President Donald Trump \u2019 s proposals would raise Americans \u2019 wages .\nAlso , a 2016 blue-ribbon study by the National Academies of Sciences told a very different story .

But panel member George Borjas , a Harvard economist , calculated the value of the tax at $ 500 billion a year . This $ 500 billion immigration tax is not paid to the government \u2014 it is paid by employees to employers and investors who gain whenever wages are lowered by the increased supply of workers jostling and competing for wages .
