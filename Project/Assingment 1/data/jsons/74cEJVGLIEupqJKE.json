For now , he plans to add a subscription to The Wall Street Journal for a more center-right perspective , and to consciously seek a wider range of reporting from other reliable sources . Still , he \u2019 s kind of \u201c feeling a little homeless now , \u201d he admits .\nIndeed , after the election , a number of Americans , particularly those on the left still bewildered by the election of Mr. Trump , have begun to question the mainstream coverage that seemed to confidently assume that Hillary Clinton would emerge as the 45th president .\nAt the same time , too , the proliferation of unreliable information has approached what many consider to be near-crisis proportions . In addition to the frustration many have felt with the mainstream press , there is growing concern social media , designed to entice engagement rather than offer factual information , has spawned the viral spread of deliberately misleading and fake news .\nThe problem of \u201c news bubbles \u201d is in many ways part of a larger social trend that some scholars have called \u201c the big sort \u201d \u2013 a troubling trend in which like-minded citizens , with mostly similar cultural preferences and political world views , cluster together in walled gardens \u2013 including neighborhoods , places of worship , and information sources .\nAnd as over six out of 10 American adults now turn to their algorithm-driven social media feeds to get news , according to Pew Research , conservatives and liberals often have radically conflicting sources of information , as a Wall Street Journal side-by-side graphic analysis of blue feeds and red feeds recently showed .\nIt \u2019 s a trend with troubling implications , scholars say . Long considered a bedrock of democracy , the \u201c free press , \u201d enshrined in the US Constitution and considered an informal \u201c fourth estate \u201d of government , is supposed to cover and provide context for the actions of the three branches of government .\n\u201c Americans are ... likely to get what they do know , or think they know , from an echo chamber , \u201d says Krista Jenkins , professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck , N.J. , via email .\n\u201c What \u2019 s needed in our discourse is a cross-pollination of ideas and viewpoints so that we begin to turn the tide on the alarming trend of seeing the other side as dangerous and misguided , \u201d Professor Jenkins continues , \u201c rather than those whose experiences and perspectives lead them to believe different things about where to go and how to get there . \u201d\nIf social media has contributed to the sorting of Americans into echo chambers , it also may have also enabled the proliferation of fake news sites and fabricated political stories online , especially on the news feeds of those on the right , which often express disdain for the \u201c mainstream media . \u201d\nSince August and leading up to the election , fake news stories with headlines like \u201c Pope Francis Shocks World , Endorses Donald Trump for President , Releases Statement \u201d or \u201c FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide , \u201d garnered over 8.7 million shares , reactions , or comments on Facebook , according to analysis from BuzzFeed News . And of the top 20 most-shared fake news stories , 17 spread information favoring Trump or excoriating Clinton .\nStories from major news sites , including The New York Times , Washington Post , and NBC News , on the other hand , garnered 7.3 million interactions .\nEarlier this week , the top result on Google for the web search \u201c final election vote count 2016 \u201d yielded a link that falsely reported that Trump , who won the Electoral College , also won the popular vote . He 's currently more than 1 million votes behind Clinton in the vote count .\nOn Monday , both companies said they would take action to combat such misinformation . Google said it would ban websites that trafficked in fake news from using its online advertising service . Facebook also said it would stop displaying ads on fake news sites .\nOn Thursday , President Obama became impassioned during a press conference in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel , decrying \u201c an age where there \u2019 s so much active misinformation and it 's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television , \u201d he said . \u201c If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made , then we won \u2019 t know what to protect . \u201d\nSome Americans are ensuring that they get fact-checked information by taking the old-fashioned step of buying a newspaper or magazine subscription .
