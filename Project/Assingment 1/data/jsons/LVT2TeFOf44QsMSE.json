''\nIt would be one thing if the nation 's leading socialist\u2014and perhaps the most popular Democrat in the country\u2014were the only one interested in creating a state-run workforce to `` compete '' with the private sector . A number of other allegedly moderate Democrats and prospective presidential candidates , including Sens . Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker , favor a universal job guarantee as well . It 's rapidly becoming a mainstream idea .\nOne imagines that a quixotic proposal like this polls quite well . I mean , who does n't want everyone to have a job ? You do n't possess a skill set that enables you to find productive work ? You do n't want to learn a new trade ? You do n't want to obtain a better education ? You have no interest in moving to an area where your work might be in demand ? You do n't want to start your career with a lower wage even if the long-term prospects of doing so might be worthwhile ? Do n't worry .

In the rare event that state workers do misbehave , they would be summoned to a Division of Progress Investigation ( a relic of our 1930s stab at socialism ) to `` take disciplinary action if needed . '' If the DPI were to run anything like major public schools systems do , you can imagine it would be a study in meritocracy .\n`` Job guarantee advocates , '' The Washington Post says , make the absurd claim that Sanders ' plan `` would drive up wages by significantly increasing competition for workers , ensuring that corporations have to offer more generous salaries and benefits if they want to keep their employees from working for the government . ''\nCorporations are concerned with profit . If the minimum wage kills jobs , why should we believe businesses ( especially smaller ones ) would compete with government-funded projects that can print money and create salaries ( and benefits ) that are wholly untethered from the real cost of labor ?

If history is any indicator , it would be used to prop up politically useful projects and keep failing industries afloat , undermining creative destruction , innovation , and long-term growth .\nYou do have to wonder , what would happen if local communities that share President Trump 's `` priorities '' were to demand utilizing this state labor ? What if they were to want to build sections of a wall on the southern border rather than make solar panels , or whatever progressive priority Sanders has in mind ?
