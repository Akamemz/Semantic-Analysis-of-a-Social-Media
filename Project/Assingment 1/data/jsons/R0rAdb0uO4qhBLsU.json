    "content": "A Congressional Election In Arizona We All Wish Did n't Have To Take Place\nIf Republicans had their way , there would not have been a gubernatorial recall election in Wisconsin . An unnecessary waste of time , many of them said .\nDemocrats , for the most part , disagree . Scott Walker 's policies , they argued , mandated the recall election .\nAs for today 's special election in Arizona 's 8th Congressional District , both Democrats and Republicans agree that it should n't be taking place at all .\nIt 's happening because Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( D ) , who in 2010 had narrowly survived a tough Tea Party-backed challenge in her bid for a third term , was seriously wounded in a Jan. 8 , 2011 Tucson shooting that left six people , including a member of her staff , dead . Unable to sufficiently recover to fulfill her duties as a member of Congress , she announced her resignation back in January .\nThat has left Democrats turning to Ron Barber , a 66-year old party stalwart who was Giffords ' chief of staff and who was among those injured in the 2011 shooting . Barber , making his first bid for office , says he will follow in her footsteps .\nThe Republican candidate is once again Jesse Kelly , 30 , a retired Marine and Iraq War veteran who came within one percentage point of defeating Giffords in 2010 , losing by just over 4,000 votes . It was a miserable year for the Democrats in Arizona \u2014 two of her House colleagues lost \u2014 but Giffords held on .\nJust as there were many attempts to make the Wisconsin recall more than it really was , there is a similar attempt to portray the Arizona special election as a referendum on President Obama , the Tea Party or 2012 . In reality , it could well just be a referendum on Gabby Giffords .\nAnd that would be just fine for the Democrats , who have not been receiving much good news of late . Last week 's victory by Walker in Wisconsin was seen by many in the party as apocalyptic . Weak job numbers were of no help either . A Barber victory today would lessen that pain , even if only a little bit .\nThe Eighth . The district , as currently comprised , is located in the southeast corner of the state , with its center in parts of Tucson . It has a Republican registration advantage of about 26,000 . From 1985 until his retirement 22 years later , it was represented by Jim Kolbe ( R ) , a moderate conservative . When Kolbe left in 2006 , the GOP nomination went to Randy Graf , a former state rep. whose immigration position was seen as so hard-line that Kolbe refused to support him . That gave Giffords , then a two-term state senator , the opportunity to make inroads with moderate Republicans ; she won the seat with 54 percent of the vote . In 2008 , despite the presence of favorite son John McCain on the presidential ballot , Giffords defeated Timothy Bee , the president of the state Senate , by 12 percentage points . But if 2006 and 2008 were Democratic years nationally , 2010 was a huge Republican year , and Giffords barely won .\nPolitical Updates . I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter . You can follow me at @ kenrudin . Time for some questions from readers .\nQ : I was confused by your numbers [ in last week 's column ] regarding the California recall .
