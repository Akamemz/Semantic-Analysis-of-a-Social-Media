They just don\u2019t understand how things work, or don\u2019t work. While ignorance might allow them to speak with astounding confidence, they are often shocked by the results of their policies. This particularly inexperienced president will go down, politely, as \u201chistorically surprised.\u201d\n\nThe central point made by conservative Republicans, or Democrats who appreciate the free market, is that the private sector, properly directed, is the most effective way to create economic growth and solve complex problems such as heath care cost control, quality and availability.
