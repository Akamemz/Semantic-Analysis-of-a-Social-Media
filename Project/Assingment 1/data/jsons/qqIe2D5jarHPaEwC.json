''\nTo kids at home in Chicago , he admitted he was often in trouble when he was a teenager .\n`` When I screwed up , the consequences were n't as high as when kids on the South Side screw up , '' he told them . `` So I had more of a safety net but these guys are no different than me .

''\nHe told CBS ' Charlie Rose last summer that the biggest mistake of his first term was not communicating his vision with the American people .\n`` When I think about what we 've done well and what we have n't done well , the mistake of my first term -- couple of years -- was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right , '' he said .\n`` And that 's important but the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism , especially during tough times . ''\nThese days he 's hardly touchy-feely , but he 's more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve . And use passion for political effect .\nDuring the fight over forced spending cuts , he 's made a clear effort to put faces on the impending changes . At one White House event , he got emotional as he stood in front of a group of first responders .\n`` And this is not an abstraction . There are people whose livelihoods are at stake . There are communities that are going to be impacted in a negative way , '' he said .\n`` And I know that sometimes all this squabbling in Washington seems very abstract , and in the abstract , people like the idea , there must be some spending we can cut , there must be some waste out there .

Instead of consoling her or expressing her concern , he asked if she got a `` pink slip '' and launched into his views on education policy .\nIn a gun control plea at his recent State of the Union address , the chamber rose to its feet as a fervent Obama reminded the country of recent tragedies .\n`` Gabby Giffords deserves a vote . The families of Newtown deserve a vote , '' Obama said on the House floor .\n`` The families of Aurora deserve a vote . The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence , they deserve a simple vote . ''\nThat 's the kind of emotional rallying cry he once saved for campaign style events outside the Beltway . No longer .\nEven the president admits he has changed , in repeated humble brags .\n`` The fascinating thing about this job is the longer you 're in it , the more humble you get and the more you recognize your own imperfections , '' he told House Democrats at their retreat in Virginia .\n`` The one thing about being president is after four years , you get pretty humble , '' Obama said Tuesday . `` You think maybe you would n't but you become more humble . You realize what you do n't know . You realize , you know , all the mistakes you make .
