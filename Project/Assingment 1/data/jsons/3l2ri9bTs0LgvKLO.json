That 's the conclusion of new research , which links increased political polarization with the painful experience of having one 's cherished assumptions shattered .\n`` Disillusioning experiences motivate a search for meaning , '' write University of Limerick psychologists Paul Maher and Eric Igou . `` People respond by seeking reassurance in political ideologies . ''\nThe researchers argue the seeds of our absolutist attitudes are found in our increasing tendency to live in political and cultural cocoons .\n`` Social media echo chambers intensify impressions that one 's views are popular , '' they write .
