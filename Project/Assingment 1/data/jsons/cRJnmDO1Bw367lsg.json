The worst problem is that no one - not the government , not the insurance companies - can tell which Americans are being left without insurance . It 's a completely broken process where people are just left in the cold .\nThe only way to confirm insurance status is to contact the insurance companies . That means that every single person who has signed up for Obamacare insurance - all 300,000 , or possibly more - should go through a separate confirmation process just to make sure they 've go the insurance they think they have :\nBut unless the 1 million Americans who have so far enrolled for coverage via the new marketplaces make sure their applications have arrived at their new insurance companies without errors , some may find they 're still uninsured when they try to refill a prescription or make a doctor 's appointment . `` The enrollment files have been getting better and more accurate , but there is still work that needs to be done , '' said Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America 's Health Insurance Plans , a trade group that represents the private insurance industry . `` The health plans are still having to go back and fix some of data errors coming through in these files .

That means that as many as 10 % of people who have signed up for Obamacare are not actually enrolled in any health plan , and could find themselves out of luck when they actually have to go to the doctor .\nThe broken health care website has actual consequences . There 's a broad swathe of Americans who , come January 1 , will be living as if they have health insurance and who will only find out when they go to the emergency room that a broken website has left them without coverage .",
