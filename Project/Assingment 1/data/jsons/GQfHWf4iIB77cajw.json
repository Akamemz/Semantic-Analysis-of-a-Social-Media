And the disappearance of Kennedy 's fickle swing vote on some landmark cases on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion .\nTrump made the long-term implications of Kennedy 's decision clear Wednesday .\n`` We have to pick a great one . We have to pick one that 's going to be there for 40 years , 45 years . We need intellect . We need so many things , '' Trump said during a campaign rally in Fargo , North Dakota .\nAssuming his pick is confirmed in the Republican-led Senate , the President can repay his debt -- already partially cleared by the seating of Justice Neil Gorsuch -- to evangelicals who took a leap of faith on his checkered character in 2016 .\nIn North Dakota Wednesday night , Trump said he was `` very honored '' that Kennedy chose to retire during his presidency , `` because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy . ''\nTrump 's next pick could jolt Republican turnout and possibly save GOP majorities in midterm elections . And Trump has a another gift to add to his mammoth tax cuts and regulatory swipes to sell to GOP voters in his 2020 re-election race .\nBut for Trump , there is a greater prize , that comes at a time when he is also tearing down legal , political and geopolitical and trading conventions that have underwritten life in America and the world for much of the period since the end of World War II .\nHe is poised to cement his own influence on American law , life , culture and character for a generation . This beats buildings emblazoned with his name or reality shows that fade into TV history . No one is going to be able to escape the reverberations of the Trump-branded Supreme Court , long after his presidency , and potentially even his life is over .\n`` It is going to be impossible for history to forget Trump , like it did Franklin Pierce or James Garfield , '' said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley .\nJUST WATCHED Congress is already clashing over Kennedy 's replacement Replay More Videos ...
