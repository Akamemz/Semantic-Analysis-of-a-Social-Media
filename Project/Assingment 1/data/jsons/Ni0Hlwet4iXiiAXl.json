At its peak , the invitation-only soirees grew so large that there were two back-to-back events , one for broadcast outlets and one for print organizations .\nJournalists who attended the events , which featured a catered buffet of lamb chops , crab claws and elaborate desserts , got to roam the decorated mansion with a spouse or other family member , a friend or a colleague , adding to the invitation 's allure .\nBut the biggest fringe-benefit was the picture-taking sessions , in which the president and first lady would patiently pose with guests and briefly chat with them in front of a Christmas tree , with the White House sending out the photos \u2014 copies of which were invariably sent home to mom . This would take a couple of hours , with long lines snaking across the building 's first floor . Bill Clinton even posed for pictures with journalists days after he was impeached .\nThe White House made no announcement that it was dropping the press party . The president and first lady threw such a gathering last December but did not pose for pictures . Trump made a brief appearance with his wife and offered a few welcoming remarks .\nTop White House officials , especially the communications staff , routinely circulated at these media parties and often talked shop . Last year , chief of staff John Kelly held forth with reporters for at least 15 minutes , making informal remarks that turned into a mini-press conference .\nThe decision is hardly shocking , given Trump \u2019 s constant attacks on `` fake news '' and the overwhelmingly negative coverage of him and his administration . In recent weeks , the White House pulled the credentials of CNN 's Jim Acosta after he refused to give up the microphone at a news conference and restored his pass only after the network filed a lawsuit .\nTrump has also twice refused to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner , a tony media awards dinner attended by every president since Richard Nixon .\nWhile dropping the media party , the White House is in the midst of a full panoply of other parties this holiday season .
