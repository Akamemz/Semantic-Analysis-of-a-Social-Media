'' complains comedian John Oliver , sneering that those are the only two countries in the world that do not require paid time off .\n`` It 's disingenuous , '' responds Onwuka , pointing out that most American workers already get paid parental leave . `` Seventeen percent , '' she says , and the number `` jumps to 60 , 70 , 80 percent when you consider people have sick time off , overtime or all-encompassing personal time . ''\nIn other words , companies and workers already are working this out -- voluntarily , without government telling them how they must handle it .\n`` Paid leave is spreading , '' says Onwuka , and not just for high-earners . `` Chipotle workers , CVS workers -- Walmart workers started to get paid leave .

''\nArrogant politicians claim they must tell ignorant businesses what 's good for them . President Obama and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand both claim mandated parental would be `` good for business .
