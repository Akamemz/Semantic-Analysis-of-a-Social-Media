    "content": "There was a reason that FDR opposed the unionization of public sector workers . Rather than the natural negotiation tension between a company owner and an employee in which the owner is trying to conserve his capital while the employee across the table tries to get as much as he can , when a politician or bureaucrat is negotiating with a public sector union , they \u2019 re both on the same side of the table , spending taxpayers \u2019 money , usually without a taxpayer representative anywhere nearby . It \u2019 s a recipe for fiscal disaster and perhaps national economic suicide .\nThe same is true , as proved this weekend , when Republicans and Democrats , having colluded to put off legislation needed to \u201c keep the government open \u201d until the waning days of existing federal spending authority , crafted a \u201c deal \u201d in which taxpayers are utterly betrayed . Government by emergency is never good for the taxpayer , and this emergency was , as so many are , a product of bipartisan conspiracy .\nRepublicans ( notwithstanding President Donald \u201c No Entitlement Reform \u201d Trump ) market themselves as the party of fiscal restraint . But once \u201c last-minute \u201d negotiations begin on a spending bill under the guise of \u201c we can \u2019 t have a shutdown , \u201d the Republican walks around from his side of the table , sits next to the Democrat , gives him a big hug , and says \u201c I \u2019 ll vote for yours if you vote for mine . \u201d\n( For those interested in an insider \u2019 s look at how this machine works , I recommend Congressman Ken Buck \u2019 s new book , Drain the Swamp : How Washington Corruption Is Worse Than You Think . )\nThe result ? A trillion-dollar deal to fund government for the remaining five months of this fiscal year in which Democrats and Republicans , or more precisely the big-spending subset of Republicans , each get a few items on their wish lists and taxpayers get shafted .\nThe Trump administration wanted an additional $ 30 billon for the Defense Department . They got a $ 12 billion increase , enough to begin making up for Barack Obama \u2019 s shameful disregard for our national defense .\nTeam Trump also wanted $ 3 billion for additional \u201c border security , \u201d but got half of that amount , again enough for the time being . Importantly , this money is not for a border wall ; that particular Trump desire was abandoned during this \u201c negotiation. \u201d [ UPDATE : During a Tuesday press conference , OMB Director Mick Mulvaney claimed that some of this money will in fact be used for a \u201c 20-foot high steel wall , \u201d just not a brick-and-mortar wall , adding \u201c that \u2019 s what Democrats don \u2019 t want you to know . ]\nWhat else did the GOP give up ?

Algore can \u2019 t believe his luck .\nThe 21 st Century Community Learning Centers program , which the Trump budget zeroed out , gets a $ 25 million increase to roughly $ 1.2 billion for this fiscal year .\nCentury Community Learning Centers program , which the Trump budget zeroed out , gets a $ 25 million increase to roughly $ 1.2 billion for this fiscal year . The bill gives a $ 550 million spending increase for \u201c disadvantaged students \u201d under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( and only a $ 9 million increase for federal charter school initiatives because Democrats hate charter schools ) .\nAnd saving the best for last : The \u201c bipartisan agreement \u201d includes $ 2 billion of increased funding for the National Institutes of Health .

There are only two possible explanations for these results :\nRepublicans were massively outmaneuvered ( again ) by Chuck Schumer . Many Republicans are all talk when it comes to fiscal responsibility .\nOK , it was a trick question ; the answer is , of course :\nLet \u2019 s remember how this game is played : Democrats and Republicans agree to wait until the last minute to make a deal , forcing both of them to abandon their stated priorities in order to \u201c get to yes \u201d quickly . \u201c Please , \u201d the Republican faux-conservative says to the Democrat , \u201c don \u2019 t make me vote for that NIH funding increase. \u201d \u201c Please , \u201d says the Democrat , \u201c don \u2019 t make me vote for your border security in exchange. \u201d It \u2019 s political \u201c Br \u2019 er Rabbit \u201d in the big-spending briar patch .\nBoth sides claim that the risk of a government \u201c shutdown \u201d is unacceptable , allowing Republicans to excuse their sinful burdening of my children and yours , and generations to come , with hundreds of billions of dollars in additional debt with each passing year . ( Democrats don \u2019 t try to excuse themselves for it ; they just claim that they \u2019 re \u201c investing . \u201d )\nBut do the people of the United States really give a rat \u2019 s posterior if the government \u201c shuts down \u201d ?
