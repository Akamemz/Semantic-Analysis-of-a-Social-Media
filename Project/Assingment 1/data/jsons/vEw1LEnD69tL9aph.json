She wrote that the law required not just Mr. McGahn , but also \u201c other current and former senior-level White House officials \u201d who receive a subpoena to appear \u2014 and that it made no difference if they worked on domestic or national security matters .\nStill , she emphasized , her ruling is only about whether Mr. McGahn must show up to be asked questions . It leaves unanswered whether the questions that lawmakers want to ask him \u2014 primarily about conversations with Mr. Trump detailed in the Mueller report \u2014 are subject to executive privilege , suggesting that even if Congress ultimately wins a Supreme Court ruling forcing Mr. McGahn to show up , the litigation process might have to start all over again .\nThe House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Mr. McGahn in May after the release of the report by the special counsel , Robert S.
