A handful of nonprofit groups in the vast political network helmed by allies of the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch have established or expanded permanent ground operations in Reid \u2019 s backyard . Focused on wooing key demographics like Latinos and veterans , they \u2019 ve also paid for ads assailing the Senate Democratic leader .\nReid , meanwhile , is ramping up his home-state political operation , quietly moving to undercut Koch-backed operations here , as well as working to neutralize potential GOP opponents .\nIntensifying and complicating the competition is that allies of Reid and the Koch are assiduously courting the wild-card donor who could dictate the terms of his race , casino mogul Sheldon Adelson . He is a friend and constituent of Reid \u2019 s , but sources say Koch operatives raised more than $ 20 million from him in 2012 , and they \u2019 re working to secure additional funding .\nThe high-level jockeying on both sides is particularly striking given that there is so little top-tier political activity in Nevada this fall . Both camps insist they \u2019 re focused entirely on the policy repercussions of 2014 midterm elections across the country . But it \u2019 s hard not to detect an intensely personal tension underlying the Koch-Reid dynamic .\nWhile there \u2019 s been some speculation that Reid might retire rather than run for reelection if Democrats lose control of the Senate this fall , the 74-year-old , in interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , seemed almost giddy about the prospects of facing down the Kochs in 2016 . So fixated is Reid that for a time this summer he kept on his desk in the Capitol a cartoon clipped from the pages of a July issue of the New Yorker magazine depicting a Scout leader reading from a book to his troop sitting around a campfire . \u201c Run everybody , run for your life , \u201d the leader says . \u201c It \u2019 s them , it \u2019 s the Koch brothers . \u201d\nReid has used the Senate floor as a forum for a months-long anti-Koch campaign , during which he \u2019 s called the brothers everything from \u201c un-American \u201d to \u201c radical \u201d and has worked to turn them into national poster children for a Republican Party that caters to the interests of the very richest while ignoring those of the middle class .\nThe attacks have motivated the very rich conservatives who help fund the Koch political operation . At the brothers \u2019 annual summer donor seminar in June , organizers erected a life-sized cardboard cutout of Reid , his arms spread and his mouth agape as if in midspeech . Emanating from it was a cartoon-like quote bubble with the word \u201c Un-American . \u201d\nCardboard Harry was the object of derision , said attendees . \u201c These donors are competitive , and competitive people like to see the competition , \u201d said one . \u201c They get fired up by competition . \u201d\nWhile Reid \u2019 s attacks don \u2019 t seem to be resonating deeply with the American public as a whole , they may help whip up Democratic donors and activists this fall . And , while Reid can be coy on the subject , he appears intent on using the tactic on his own base headed into 2016 .\nAs Reid last week ambled from an SUV to a side entrance of an MGM Grand here for a speech to the supportive United Steelworkers International Convention , he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he wasn \u2019 t worried about the Koch forces \u2019 buildup in his backyard . \u201c I \u2019 ve always been targeted . \u2026 That \u2019 s not news , \u201d he said , playfully dismissing a question about whether there was a personal element to the Koch effort . \u201c I don \u2019 t see that they have any reason to come after me . Why would they ? \u201d\nBut a few minutes later , after taking the stage to Bob Marley \u2019 s \u201c Get Up , Stand Up , \u201d Reid confided to 2,500 cheering union members that , in fact , he is trying to personally antagonize the Kochs .\n\u201c Ladies and gentlemen , when I was walking in here today , somebody grabbed me from one of the Washington publications and said \u2018 the Koch brothers say they \u2019 re here organizing in Nevada , \u2019 \u201d Reid regaled the crowd . \u201c I said \u2018 why would they be worried about me ?
