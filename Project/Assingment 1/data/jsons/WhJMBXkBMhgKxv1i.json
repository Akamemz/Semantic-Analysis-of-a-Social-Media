But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States , the storm is still brewing .\nWith a new threat of immigration raids on Sunday , immigrant rights advocates and undocumented immigrants told CNN that fear in their communities is growing .\nThey 're calling hotlines , afraid to go outside and unsure of where to turn . Some are staying home from work . Others are posting signs by doors inside their homes telling them what to do if ICE agents show up .\nWhile the uneasy mix of panic and preparation weeks ago felt like a hurricane , there was one notable difference for the housekeeper in Miami . The store in her neighborhood seemed eerily empty . Already , she said , people were afraid to go out .\n`` I said , 'OK , you know what , we 're going to keep the windows down , the blinds down . I do n't want any noise . I want everybody to stay calm and try to turn off the lights in the living room , so if they come , they do n't know that we are in the house , ' '' she said . `` I know my rights .

She said she came to the United States more than two decades ago on a visa , which she overstayed as she sought asylum .\nElena lost her case but stayed in the United States , where she says she 's built a life and grown her family . She 's terrified of being separated from them .\n`` This is a horrible feeling , '' she said Thursday . `` These past two days , I 've been waking up in the middle of the night .
