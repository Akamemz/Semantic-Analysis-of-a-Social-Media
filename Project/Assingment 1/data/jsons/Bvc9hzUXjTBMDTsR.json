    "content": "President Obama will award former President Bill Clinton the Medal of Freedom on Wednesday at the White House , a public display of admiration belied by the enduring tensions between the two men .\nMr. Obama will bestow the nation \u2019 s highest civilian honor on Mr. Clinton for the work during his presidency and , more recently , as head of the Clinton Global Initiative . Fifteen other honorees will attend the ceremony in the East Room , but all eyes will be on the president and his sometime nemesis , the former president .\nIt will be their first face-to-face encounter since Mr. Clinton publicly encouraged a Democratic rebellion last week against a portion of Obamacare and urged Mr. Obama to make good on his promise that Americans could keep their health insurance plans . The comeuppance fueled speculation that the Clintons are starting to distance themselves from the increasingly unpopular Mr. Obama in preparation for a presidential bid by Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 .\n\u201c The White House told me they don \u2019 t have any problem with what [ Mr. Clinton ] said ; I also don \u2019 t believe them , \u201d said a Democrat with ties to the West Wing . \u201c There will always be a suspicion among Democrats that [ the Clintons ] are only in it for themselves . \u201d\nBut an adviser in the Clinton White House , Lanny Davis , predicted that the episode last week will not mar Wednesday \u2019 s ceremony .\n\u201c Not only is it not going to lead to tension , I think President Obama welcomed it , \u201d Mr. Davis said of Mr. Clinton \u2019 s remarks on Obamacare .
