Noah Berger/Associated Press\nMr. Tong \u2019 s faith in the American Dream has been shaken . But that day , he had a ticket to see Mr. Trump speak about making America great again . Despite the sweltering heat , Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally .\nThat same morning , Anthony McBride , who is anti-Trump , woke up in his friend \u2019 s mother \u2019 s apartment , where he has lived for the past three years , ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own .\nHe is 21 , too young to carry the stain of life \u2019 s disappointments . He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company . But art school is too expensive . He works two jobs \u2014 at a car dealership and a clothing store \u2014 to save for it .\nHe hopes they will inspire \u201c a movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be , \u201d he said .\nMr. McBride \u2019 s faith in the American Dream remains intact , but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign . On the morning of the rally , Mr. McBride put on a \u201c BE YRSLF \u201d T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center , eager to see for himself what a Trump event was really like .\n\u201c It was hot that day , \u201d Mr. Tong recalled . \u201c I was still debating whether or not I wanted to go , and I just kind of thought , \u2018 Oh , I got to show my support . \u2019 \u201d\nIn the convention hall , Mr. Tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd .\n\u201c I was really surprised , \u201d he said . A rally he had attended earlier in the spring in Southern California , he said , \u201c was mostly Caucasian and middle-aged. \u201d But in San Jose , a city that is about 30 percent Asian and 30 percent Hispanic , more minorities turned out .\nOutside the hall , beyond the police barricades , protesters waved signs demanding socialism . Young men handed out the Revolutionary Communist Party \u2019 s newspaper .\nLike many Asians in San Jose , Mr. Tong was born in Vietnam . He was 4 when Communists captured Saigon .\nHis family had three strikes against it : His father had worked with the United States military . His grandfather had an import-export business . And they hailed from China , a country that once colonized Vietnam . Officials forced Mr. Tong \u2019 s family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor .\n\u201c The Communist philosophy was , \u2018 If you are a teacher , a professor , an intellectual , wealthy , then we are going to make you suffer , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Tong said .\nWhen he was 9 , his family made it to California . Like others who had fled Vietnam , they embraced the Republican Party \u2019 s strong anticommunism stance .\nMr. Tong considers himself a moderate . During the booming 1990s , he once cast a ballot for Bill Clinton . He says he does not agree with Mr. Trump \u2019 s remarks about immigrants and Mexicans .\nStill , Mr. Tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country . Like many Trump supporters , he blames President Obama .\n\u201c He seems more polarizing , \u201d Mr. Tong said of Mr. Obama . \u201c He stirs people up . \u201d\nMr. Tong once felt boundless optimism about the United States . His parents , who worked entry-level jobs in electronics , had been able to buy a three-bedroom home in a well-off San Jose suburb . But now Mr. Tong can not afford to rent \u2014 let alone buy \u2014 a home of his own . He was drawn to the June rally by Mr. Trump \u2019 s promise to make America as strong as it was when Mr. Tong arrived in the country .\nMr. Trump took the stage and declared , \u201c We have a country that \u2019 s not working anymore . \u201d\n\u201c We have a chance to be greater than ever before , \u201d he told the crowd .\nMr. Tong left the rally clutching a sign : \u201c The silent majority stands with Trump . \u201d\nHe meandered back to his car , chatting with a teenager from Mexico who held a sign opposing Trump . They joked about trading signs . Nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary . But when Mr. Tong reached the parking garage , he witnessed something shocking : protesters trying to steal Trump hats off the heads of an older Hispanic couple .\nHe added : \u201c At that moment , I felt the whole crowd surrounding me . You \u2019 re fearing for your life . \u201d\nMr. Tong ran into the garage . He noticed a tall black man coming behind him .\nIt was Mr. McBride \u2019 s day off , he recalled . \u201c I slept in , watched some TV , \u201d he said .\nWhile checking Twitter , he noticed that Mr. Trump was coming to town .\nMr. McBride hoped to get into the rally \u201c to go experience what he says for myself , \u201d he said . But a wall of police officers blocked the entrance . So he drifted to the \u201c free speech \u201d area , where protesters \u2014 including some friends from Oak Grove , where he had gone to high school \u2014 gathered . Mr. McBride had fond memories of Oak Grove , even though he was asked to leave it .\nMr. McBride was in jail for six days , accused of vandalism , battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong \u2019 s sign . Jim Wilson/The New York Times\nIn his senior year , he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community . Rival fans chanted that Oak Grove students were on welfare . Mr. McBride said he and his friends responded with their own chant , \u201c We drive sober \u201d \u2014 a painful reference to a drunken-driving death the rival school had recently suffered . Afterward , Mr. McBride said , school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study . ( The school \u2019 s principal declined to comment . )\nAt the time , Mr. McBride lived with his aunt , who told him he had to be in school to stay with her . He ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend \u2019 s mother . Three years later , he is still there .\nMr. McBride considers himself a moderate . He opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants . He believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded .\nBut it is racism \u2014 not government regulation of the economy \u2014 that worries him . The son of an African-American father and an Irish mother he has not seen since he was 4 , Mr. McBride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice , not Democratic politicians .\n\u201c People are just frustrated , \u201d he said . \u201c With police brutality . With feeling not equal to white people . \u201d\nTo Mr. McBride \u2019 s generation , the spate of high-profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism . Protests \u2014 not the election of a black president \u2014 have brought a modicum of justice .\nJoining the gathering crowd outside the convention center , Mr. McBride felt he had justice on his side .\nAt first , he said , it felt like a carnival outside the arena . People danced to Mexican music . Street vendors sold watermelon .\nBut then the rally inside ended . Trump supporters poured out . Protesters chanted obscenities at them . They hurled insults back .\nA blonde woman named Rachel Casey , who was wearing a Trump shirt , filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd . Protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the Marriott Hotel next door . Protesters surrounded her in the doorway .\n\u201c I was in the front , just clapping , \u201d Mr. McBride said . \u201c Someone in the back started throwing eggs . One of them hit me .

Afterward, he expected to be allowed to go home. Instead, they handcuffed him and took him to jail, where he remained for six days, accused of vandalism, battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong\u2019s sign.\n\nOn a recent Wednesday, Mr. McBride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and Hispanic men, nearly all of them represented by a single public defender.\n\n\u201cMcBride? You\u2019re our Trump guy, right?\u201d she asked.\n\nShe explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally, prosecutors were adding a new charge: the false imprisonment of Ms. Casey, who had been egged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to get it down to \u2018disturbing the peace,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get there, but that\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nNow Mr. McBride, who cannot afford a lawyer, is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn\u2019t feel he committed, or fight the charges. He thinks about that moment when he grabbed Mr. Tong\u2019s sign, and about what made him let it go.",
