Dan Coats isn \u2019 t sure whether to run for reelection \u2014 but if he does , it \u2019 ll be because he has some degree of confidence the new GOP Congress can get something done .\nThe Department of Homeland Security debacle , he says , has been discouraging in that regard .\n\u201c I thought we were off to a good start with Keystone , but now we \u2019 ve hit a wall , so I \u2019 m trying to weigh where we are going for the next 18 months or so , \u201d Coats said . He added : \u201c We have been at this for two months now , and we are already hung up in terms of not being able to govern . \u201d\nRepublicans on both sides of the Capitol were shaken at the party \u2019 s handling of the DHS funding dispute that led to a monthlong standoff , paralyzed the GOP agenda and prompted serious questions internally about whether their newfound majority can deliver anything significant over the next two years . The fear among House Republicans is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be too quick to heed Democratic demands and push through watered-down bills on education , trade , health care and the budget . And the worry among Senate Republicans is that their House counterparts will scuttle hard-fought compromises that offer the only way to overcome filibusters and get bills to President Barack Obama \u2019 s desk .\nSen. Richard Burr , the North Carolina Republican who faces reelection next year and is close friends with John Boehner , voiced confidence that the House speaker can push through bills . But he asserted that Boehner \u201c just might not be able to do it with all Republicans . \u201d\n\u201c And that \u2019 s something that Republicans need to decide : whether they want to marginalize themselves in that fashion , \u201d Burr said . \u201c The reality is we have to govern . And we have to get legislation to the president \u2019 s desk \u2014 if , in fact , that we want to prove we can govern . Just to kill things in Congress , we \u2019 re pretty good at that . \u201d\nThe comments came after Boehner was forced on Tuesday to swallow a $ 39.7 billion DHS funding bill free of riders that would have blocked Obama \u2019 s efforts to defer deportations for 5 million undocumented immigrants . The bill , which passed the House 257-167 on the support of mostly Democrats , came after a tumultuous month in which conservative immigration hard-liners in the House pushed Boehner \u2019 s team to take an aggressive posture against Obama \u2019 s actions . McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , stymied by repeated filibusters led by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , ultimately stripped out the immigration riders to keep DHS funded , prompting outrage from House conservatives and breeding a new level of antipathy among Republicans in Congress .\nIt also highlighted a stark reality : Senate Republicans need at least six Democratic votes to break a filibuster , meaning they \u2019 ll have to compromise to pass Trade Promotion Authority , a No Child Left Behind rewrite , the 12 annual appropriations bills , a debt limit increase , a cybersecurity plan and a war powers resolution against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . But the House conservative opposition to those compromises could be enough to scuttle a bill if the liberal House Democratic Caucus refuses to lend support .\nBarely two months into the GOP majority , the pessimism is palpable , particularly among the Republican rank and file .\n\u201c Those people who ran around telling Americans that if both houses are in one party that things are going to start happening , with all due respect , probably oversold it , \u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei ( R-Nev. ) . He added : \u201c On just the straight political scorecard , congratulations Sen. Reid , looks like you are still running the Senate . \u201d\nRep. Paul Gosar ( R-Ariz. ) said he \u201c absolutely \u201d was less optimistic that Congress can achieve its objectives after the DHS stalemate .\n\u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a U.S. senator and go home and defend my actions , \u201d Gosar said . \u201c We just started ramping up this fight against our senators , making sure they have an obligation to do their constitutional duty and debate this and not hide behind Robert \u2019 s Rules of Order . \u201d\nGosar \u2019 s senior Arizona senator , John McCain , urged House conservatives to align with their party leadership \u2019 s strategy \u201c so we can go to the American people with a candidate for president in 2016 and say , \u2018 Here \u2019 s what we \u2019 ve accomplished \u2019 \u2014 not a standoff between House and Senate Republicans . \u201d\nWith the DHS fight behind them , McCain said he hopes Republicans \u201c will all learn that we are not really fulfilling the commitment we made to voters last November . I campaigned for all these Senate candidates , and I said , \u2018 Look , we are going to govern . \u2019 \u201d\nSenate Republicans say publicly and privately that Boehner and his leadership team should take on the conservatives and put together a bipartisan coalition that could pass bills with a majority of Republicans and a sizable chunk of centrist Democrats . But House Republicans say most swing Democratic votes have vanished as the GOP expanded its majority in recent elections .\n\u201c Look , it isn \u2019 t the 1980s or 1990s , \u201d said one House Republican leadership aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the challenges facing party leaders . \u201c Blue Dogs are an endangered species because we \u2019 ve beaten most of them . So there \u2019 s not a block of centrist Democrats that we can pick up by moving legislation just slightly to the left . \u201d\nIndeed , House and Senate Republican leaders say the burden of enacting legislation also falls on the shoulders of Senate Democrats and the White House . Democrats in the Senate , they say , need to allow legislation to come up for debate , shape the contours of bills by allowing votes on amendments , and drop dilatory tactics blocking final passage . And the White House , Republicans say , will need to put its political muscle behind measures that will face opposition from Democrats , such as the president \u2019 s trade agenda .\nSen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) , the Senate majority whip , blamed Democrats for the problems of the past several weeks , but acknowledged that his party could have handled the immigration fight more effectively .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s probably a number of lessons to be learned from this experience , \u201d Cornyn said before the DHS vote . \u201c And I \u2019 m sure we \u2019 ll be talking about that for a while . But right now , I \u2019 d like to see us resolve this issue this week and get it behind us . \u201d\nBoehner spokesman Michael Steel said Republicans \u2019 \u201c challenge in the future \u201d will be overcoming Senate Democrats who are trying \u201c to protect President Obama . \u201d\nBut in a brief interview , Reid shot back when asked about the GOP \u2019 s handling of Congress : \u201c Right now , it hasn \u2019 t been too good . \u201d\nAfter making bold promises that they can govern , Republicans are eager to have something to show voters ahead of the 2016 elections . Failure to move legislation \u2014 or more fiscal brinkmanship \u2014 could affect key Senate races , Republicans fear , particularly for the 24 GOP senators who are on the ballot next year , compared with just 10 Democratic seats .\nSome Republicans , like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , believe the upcoming fights will become easier because immigration is an emotional issue , particularly among Republicans . \u201c If it continues , we \u2019 re in trouble , \u201d Graham added .\nSen. Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) , who is vulnerable next year , said battling the president when the GOP believes he \u2019 s overreached is perfectly within bounds . But , he added , the party should avoid high-stakes fights that could prompt a backlash with little to show for them . \u201c I think what this tells us is we have to be very careful and strategic about how we fight back and over what vehicles . \u201d\nOne vehicle coming up is the battle over raising the national debt ceiling , something that the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday would need to occur by October or November . After fiscal brinkmanship over the debt limit led to fears of a default multiple times in recent years , the White House and Reid have insisted they will accept only a \u201c clean \u201d increase free of other provisions .\nBut Toomey said a borrowing limit increase should include provisions taking aim at the debt , a position consistent with most conservatives in Congress .\n\u201c The debt ceiling is a perfectly legitimate occasion to address that , \u201d Toomey said .\nBeyond the debt ceiling , Republicans still have to move funding bills before the end of September , many of which will be ripe for riders aimed at blocking Obama policies on the environment , health care and financial services \u2014 which could again renew fears of a government shutdown .\n\u201c If we grant the Democrats the ability to portray us and demonstrate we are dysfunctional , then I think it makes it more problematic \u201d to keep Congress and win the White House next year , Coats said .\nTo that end , some influential Senate Republicans , like Lamar Alexander , are progressing with their own agendas \u2014 regardless of what the House can do . The Tennessee Republican is aiming to draft a bipartisan No Child Left Behind rewrite that is bound to be more moderate than a version pulled from House consideration last week .\n\u201c I learned a long time ago that a senator should focus on the Senate , but the House should focus on the House , \u201d Alexander said .",
