    "content": "Syrian Democratic Forces fighters enter the former ISIS stronghold of Raqqa , October 17 , 2017 . ( Erik De Castro/Reuters )\nUnlike Trump \u2019 s other boasts , the shift in the war occurred on his watch and after he changed the rules of engagement .\nWhen President Donald Trump boasts , the nation rolls its collective eyes . From his first moments in office , Americans on both sides of the political aisle understood that his claims of triumph usually had little to do with the facts . That was true of the talk about record attendance at his inauguration and continues to also be true about his claims of passing more legislation or getting more done than all of his predecessors . The controversies engendered by Trump \u2019 s bragging or false statements ( such as those he recently made about other presidents consoling the survivors of American combat troops killed in battle ) have become the obsessive concern of his critics as well as of fans who brand the president \u2019 s debunkers as purveyors of \u201c fake news \u201d or merely take delight in his trolling of his liberal opponents .\nBut when it comes to one of Trump \u2019 s boasts , it \u2019 s hard for even his sternest detractors to gainsay him . Try as they might to deny it , even the efforts of the New York Times to discount his assertion rings false . ISIS was still largely undefeated and in control of much of the territory of Iraq and Syria when Trump was sworn in before a non-record setting crowd . But only nine months into his administration , the Islamic State \u2019 s hold on these countries has dwindled , and after the liberation this week of Raqqa , Syria , capital of the Islamists \u2019 caliphate , it \u2019 s fair to say that the group is being routed after years in which it held its own against coalition forces .\nAs with any war and , indeed , a great many other occurrences during any administration , the personal credit or blame that accrues to a president is widely exaggerated . The people winning this war are the U.S. air crews and special operators killing the terrorists as well as the coalition forces \u2014 principally local militias and the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters \u2014 who have paid for the ground won from the terrorists in blood . Trump didn \u2019 t personally beat ISIS anymore than Franklin Roosevelt beat Japan and Germany singlehandedly . Nor , on the other side of the ledger , were Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon solely to blame for the disaster in Vietnam . But that is how history and politics works , and if the current victories lead , as seems highly likely , to the collapse of the caliphate , the only reason to deny Trump his fair share of the credit is partisan politics and the personal animus most of the press harbors toward him .\nRecent political history provides us with a clear example of how this works .\nRepublicans and conservatives winced in 2011 when President Barack Obama took credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden . Their irritation grew as Obama and other Democrats never missed an opportunity during the 2012 election to do a bin Laden touchdown dance , which sought to draw a contrast between this easily understood symbolic American victory and the bloody stalemates produced by the frustrating wars George W. Bush fought in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nBut while Obama may have exploited bin Laden \u2019 s death for partisan purposes , the fact remains that it happened on his watch , not that of Bush , who had done all that he could to achieve the same object , as well as to avenge 9/11 by depriving al-Qaeda of its base in Afghanistan . Dismiss it as mere luck if you like , but if we are prepared to blame presidents for everything else that happens while they are in the White House , it \u2019 s only fair to let them take credit for anything good , especially if they are the ones involved in making the decisions , as Obama was on the bin Laden operation .\nThe facts about the campaign against ISIS are just as clear-cut .\nWhen Trump took office , the U.S. had been mired in a discouraging stalemate in the fight against a group that Obama had initially dismissed as the \u201c JV \u201d terrorist team and therefore unworthy of his attention . Obama had little appetite for another Middle East war after he pulled U.S. forces out of Iraq . Having claimed that he had ended or wound down America \u2019 s wars , it took more than a year for him to admit that his Iraq bugout and refusal to intervene in the Syrian civil war \u2014 even to enforce his \u201c red line \u201d over Bashar al-Assad \u2019 s use of chemical weapons \u2014 had created a vacuum that ISIS filled . That reluctance seemed to carry over into U.S. efforts during the two years following Obama \u2019 s 2014 pledge to \u201c degrade and ultimately destroy \u201d the terrorist group as coalition forces made little headway against the enemy .\nDid Trump entirely reinvent the war against ISIS ? No , he didn \u2019 t , and his liberal detractors have spent the year correctly pointing out that the coalition war plans implemented this year were conceived by Obama \u2019 s Pentagon . But try as they might to deprive Trump of credit , there \u2019 s no way to pretend that the coalition didn \u2019 t have better success with those plans this year than they had in the previous two . In January , ISIS controlled 23,300 square miles . Today it holds onto about 9,300 square miles .\nIt is unfair to U.S. and coalition troops to claim , as Trump does , that they didn \u2019 t \u201c fight to win \u201d until he arrived in the Oval Office . But as the Times admits , there was one significant difference . In the spring , Trump loosened the rules of engagement to allow commanders in the field more authority in day-to-day decisions about fighting the enemy .

But if you are going to link Trump to that statistic , it isn \u2019 t logical to assert that the new rules of engagement had nothing to do with freeing up the coalition to attack the enemy with more aggression .
