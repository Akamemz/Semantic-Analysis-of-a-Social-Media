According to the Pew Research Center , nearly half of nonvoters have a family income of under $ 30,000 per year , compared to 19 percent of likely voters . Nonvoters are also far more likely to be minorities and young .\nThat 's not just a random Election Day fact , either \u2014 it can mean a lot for what sorts of policies politicians end up supporting . For example , likely voters are slightly more likely than nonvoters to think aid programs to the poor are ineffective or even harmful .\nThat 's not a huge majority , but there 's also a more sizable divide in who uses those benefits . Nonvoters are altogether more likely to need those programs . According to Pew 's data , nonvoters are more likely to be on means-tested government assistance and to have all sorts of other financial difficulties .\nThe class divide in voting , in other words , has a systematic impact on policies \u2014 it advantages the preferences of the rich and drains support from the programs that benefit the poor .\nWhy is there this class divide in who votes ? There are all sorts of reasons \u2014 some people ca n't get out of work to vote , for example , and the decline of unionization may have disconnected many Americans from politics .
