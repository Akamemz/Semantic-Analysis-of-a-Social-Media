    "content": "The U.S. labor market in October reached its longest stretch of job creation since at least World War II , a run at odds with a slow pickup in wages and voter discontent with the economy .\nU.S. employers , which added 214,000 jobs to payrolls last month , are on pace to post the best yearly gain in employment since 1999 . The steady job growth has pushed the nation \u2019 s unemployment rate down to 5.8 % last month , closer to a level many economists consider healthy . It also suggests U.S. businesses are largely shrugging off mounting worries about overseas growth that contributed to market tumult in the first half of last month .\nYet while Friday \u2019 s report from the Labor Department showed the 49th straight month of job gains , the current expansion trails several other shorter rebounds in terms of total job growth . The positive reading came just days after voters flipped control of Congress to Republicans , in part due to economic concerns . Exit polls during Tuesday \u2019 s election pointed to unease over the strength and breadth of the economic expansion .\nJob growth has been fueled in part by some workers trading good-paying jobs lost during the recession for lower-paying positions or part-time work . That has been one factor constraining incomes and restraining consumer spending . As a result , the economy grew 2.3 % during the 12 months ending in September , roughly matching the modest gains of the prior three years .\nIn remarks before a Cabinet meeting at the White House , President Barack Obama noted the clouds still hovering over the economy . \u201c Despite this solid growth , despite the drop in unemployment , there are still a lot of folks out there who are anxious about their futures , who are having trouble making ends meet at the end of the month , \u201d he said .\nAfter winning control of the Senate for the first time in eight years , GOP leaders said the economy will be their top priority . \u201c We will honor the voters \u2019 trust by focusing , first , on jobs and the economy , \u201d House Speaker John Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this past week .\nThe long streak of job gains does point to a much improved economy nearly seven years after the deepest recession since the Great Depression . In many ways , consistent U.S. growth is the envy of the world . China \u2019 s economy , still far outpacing U.S. growth , is showing signs of slowing along with other emerging economies , while the eurozone is again flirting with recession .\nThe U.S. \u201c economy is slowly becoming less fragile and less susceptible to shocks , \u201d said BNP Paribas economist Laura Rosner . \u201c Ultimately , more people are at work and that should lead to more spending . \u201d\nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen , shown in August , has been watching the jobs numbers closely for signs of diminishing \u201c slack. \u201d Associated Press\nMany U.S. firms are reporting improving sales and profits . Simmons Machine Tool Corp. , which makes equipment used to repair railway wheels , is expecting sales to grow better than 10 % this year . The Albany , N.Y. , firm added 10 workers to its 100-person staff , and is looking to hire six more .\n\u201c Business has been very good , we \u2019 ve recently signed some major contracts , \u201d said Simmons President David William Davis .

Terex Corp. , a Westport , Conn. , maker of construction equipment , laid off about 500 employees from its aerial-work-platforms division in recent months in response to disappointing profits . The firm , which has multiple facilities and customers in Brazil , cited the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian currency as a particular challenge .\n\u201c We decided to release the temporary workers , \u201d Terex division President Matt Fearon told investors last week , \u201c and to settle into a capacity position that matches the actual demand that we expect to see for the balance of the year . \u201d\nJob growth across the entire economy is the longest on record , with total payrolls climbing every month since October 2010 , putting the current stretch just past the 48-month run in the late 1980s . The current streak for only private-sector employers is seven months longer .\nBut it \u2019 s certainly not the strongest stretch . Recoveries in the 1970s , 80s and 90s included job growth that was larger than the current rebound , despite those expansions being shorter .\nThe latest economic expansion , which started in mid-2009 , has failed so far to produce a significant upturn in wages .
