They \u2019 ll fight because the weaker neighbors combine to pull down the strong one . They \u2019 ll fight because one allies with country A and another allies with its enemy , country B -- and for myriad other reasons .\nThis , of course , is the history of Western Europe almost down to the present day . It is what led many Western political thinkers to advocate and , after World War II , Western politicians to bring about a radical re-ordering of politics on the European continent such that political differentiation would be made inconsequential through the creation of a homogeneous European state . In the newly established European Union , war , victory , and defeat would be made impossible on the continent by binding its nations ever closer together .\nYet as French political philosopher Pierre Manent has argued , since the people of these nations have not been so eager to be homogenized , the process has become increasingly undemocratic -- or , rather , anti-democratic ( \u201c a kratos without a demos \u201d ) , characterized by cynical efforts to delegitimize all moral distinctions in politics : \u201c Since every significant collective difference puts human unity in danger , one must render every difference insignificant .
