    "content": "In 2014 , I was the 35-year-old Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada . The landscape wasn \u2019 t looking good for my party that year . There were no high-profile national races to help boost turnout , and after the top candidate bowed out of the governor \u2019 s race , \u201c None of the Above \u201d ended up winning the Democratic primary .\nSo when my campaign heard from Vice-President Joe Biden \u2019 s office that he was looking to help me and other Democrats in the state , I was grateful and flattered . His team offered to bring him to a campaign rally in an effort to help boost voter turnout . We set the date for November 1 , just three days before election day .\nIn a state as large but sparsely populated as Nevada , it takes nonstop travel to connect with all its residents . You \u2019 re lucky to get properly fed , much less look properly coiffed as female candidates are often required to do . I was exhausted and short on time , so decided to not to wash my hair the morning of the rally . I sprayed some dry shampoo in my hair , raced off to the Reno airport , and flew back to Las Vegas .\nThe event proceeded as most political events do : coordinated chaos with random problems that no one can predict . I found Eva Longoria , co-founder of the Latino Victory Project , roaming the parking lot trying to figure out how to get inside the union hall . My staff was running around town trying to purchase ferns because according to Biden \u2019 s team , no other vegetation was acceptable for the stage .\nThe day of the 2014 rally , speakers gathered and took photos before going on stage . Flores ( right ) is pictured with Longoria and Biden before the uncomfortable encounter .\nI found my way to the holding room for the speakers , where everyone was chatting , taking photos , and getting ready to speak to the hundreds of voters in the audience . Just before the speeches , we were ushered to the side of the stage where we were lined up by order of introduction . As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd , I felt two hands on my shoulders . I froze . \u201c Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me ? \u201d\nI felt him get closer to me from behind . He leaned further in and inhaled my hair . I was mortified . I thought to myself , \u201c I didn \u2019 t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it . And also , what in the actual fuck ? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair ? \u201d He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head . My brain couldn \u2019 t process what was happening . I was embarrassed . I was shocked . I was confused . There is a Spanish saying , \u201c tragame tierra , \u201d it means , \u201c earth , swallow me whole. \u201d I couldn \u2019 t move and I couldn \u2019 t say anything . I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me . My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience .\nBy then , as a young Latina in politics , I had gotten used to feeling like an outsider in rooms dominated by white men . But I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before . Biden was the second-most powerful man in the country and , arguably , one of the most powerful men in the world . He was there to promote me as the right person for the lieutenant governor job . Instead , he made me feel uneasy , gross , and confused . The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends , family , or romantic partners \u2014 and I felt powerless to do anything about it .\nOur strange interaction happened during a pivotal moment in my political career . I \u2019 d spent months raising money , talking to voters , and securing endorsements . Biden came to Nevada to speak to my leadership and my potential to be second-in-command \u2014 an important role he knew firsthand . But he stopped treating me like a peer the moment he touched me . Even if his behavior wasn \u2019 t violent or sexual , it was demeaning and disrespectful . I wasn \u2019 t attending the rally as his mentee or even his friend ; I was there as the most qualified person for the job .\nImagine you \u2019 re at work and a male colleague who you have no personal relationship with approaches you from behind , smells your hair , and kisses you on the head . Now imagine it \u2019 s the CEO of the company . If Biden and I worked together in a traditional office , I would have complained to the HR department , but on the campaign trail , there \u2019 s no clear path for what to do when a powerful man crosses the line . In politics , you shrug it off , smile for the cameras , and get back to the task of trying to win your race .\nAfter the event , I told a few of my staff what happened .

Who do you tell ? What do you say ?
