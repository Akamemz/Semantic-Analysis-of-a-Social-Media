    "content": "Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton at a fundraiser in New York City in 2000 ( William J. Clinton Presidential Library / Handout via Reuters )\nThe Clinton \u2019 90s , the Trump \u2019 10s , friendless Taiwan , savage Saudi Arabia , and more\nIn the Clinton \u2019 90s , a lot of us said the following : There was the lawbreaking , yes \u2014 the perjury , subornation of perjury , etc . But also the \u201c underlying facts \u201d : The president used an intern for sex in the Oval Office . That was no good . The president was unfit to hold the office .\nToday , there are legal questions , as before : campaign-finance violations , for example . But also the underlying facts : a president who pays off porn stars and Playboy bunnies , and lies and lies .\nWhere is a sense of shame ? Where is a sense of honor ? In late 1995 , Colin Powell gave some remarks , explaining why he wasn \u2019 t running for president . In the course of those remarks , he made some points about America \u2014 including a certain lack of shame . Shame needed to be brought back to our society , Powell said .\nDid you see this news article from earlier this week ? \u201c Four Japanese basketball players on Monday apologized for bringing \u2018 disgrace \u2019 to their nation after they were kicked out of the Asian Games for paying prostitutes for sex . \u201d\nOne of the players said , \u201c I deeply apologize for our careless act that has brought disgrace not only on basketball fans but also on all of the Japanese people. \u201d The head of the delegation said , \u201c I just feel a sense of shame . \u201d\n\u2022 Trump gave an interview to Reuters . Asked about Kim Jong-un , he said , \u201c Look , I have a good relationship with him . I like him . A lot of people will say , \u2018 How could you possibly like him ? \u2019 I get along with him very well . We have a good chemistry . I have a good chemistry with Putin , too . \u201d\nI \u2019 m sure of it . Personally , I prefer American presidents who don \u2019 t \u201c like \u201d murderous dictators and who have something unlike chemistry with them . America is a great liberal democracy . In the national interest , we have to have relations with some dictators \u2014 but we don \u2019 t have to like them or have good chemistry with them .\nThis is something that every Republican and every conservative would have said until very recently .\n\u2022 If they retake the House , Democrats will be itching to impeach Trump . I think that would be unwise for them , politically . ( I \u2019 m not in the habit of giving them advice , and they \u2019 re not in the habit of taking it from me . ) Impeachment would cause many Trump-skeptical Americans \u2014 Republicans and independents \u2014 to rally \u2019 round the president . Trump voters would consider themselves cheated out of their rightful choice in 2016 . If they were smart , the Democrats \u2019 watchword would be : Ballot Box or Bust .\n\u2022 My favorite headline of the recent period ? Oh , man , behold this beauty from the Associated Press : \u201c Mooning case against Virginia softball coach \u2019 s wife wanes. \u201d ( Article here . )\n\u2022 A friend of mine lives in that state , Virginia , which has a Senate race this year . My friend is a conservative \u2014 old-school , pre-Trump . He is loath to vote for the Republican , a guy who has flirted with white nationalism , and he is loath to vote for the incumbent Democrat . What can he do ? Not much .\nIf someone wants to give us a new party , I propose a slogan for it : \u201c Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair. \u201d I thought of that all by myself , you see . ( Do you happen to know the second part of Washington \u2019 s statement ? \u201c The rest is in the hands of God . \u201d )\n\u2022 Politico published an article headed \u201c Behind Trump allies \u2019 shifting explanations of 2016 payoffs to women. \u201d In March 2018 , the Wall Street Journal asked Michael Cohen for a comment , and he answered with two words : \u201c Fake News. \u201d What the Journal was reporting was not fake news , of course . Cohen has pleaded guilty to what he said was \u201c fake . \u201d\nMore and more , I think that \u201c fake news \u201d is the most obnoxious phrase in the English language . For many , it does not mean news that is false ; it means \u201c news I don \u2019 t want to hear . \u201d\n\u2022 Last Sunday , the president tweeted , \u201c Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times . They actually called to complain and apologize \u2013 a big step forward. \u201d Angry with a capital A , mind you .\nBut more important : Does anyone believe that journalists called to complain and apologize ? Whom did they call ? Could we have a list of the callers ?\n\u2022 Also on Sunday , the president tweeted , \u201c The failing @ nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel , he must be a John Dean type \u2018 RAT. \u2019 But I allowed him and all others to testify \u2013 I didn \u2019 t have to . \u201d\nEarlier , The Drudge Report affixed a label to Cohen : \u201c RAT . \u201d\nI have a memory . One of the things that turned me off the New York Post , many years ago , was its habit of using the word \u201c rat \u201d to describe FBI informants , in headlines . The paper was adopting mafia lingo and the mafia mentality . I didn \u2019 t like that .\nWhen someone says \u201c rat , \u201d he often means , \u201c He broke the code of omert\u00e0 and is now telling the truth , which is a betrayal . \u201d\nLoyalty is a fine quality , but one fraught with complications , as you know . Loyalty to a lie is especially problematic . . .\n\u2022 For the past many years , the PRC has been buying off Taiwan \u2019 s few remaining allies . El Salvador is the latest to bite the dust . The Salvadoran government is even moving Salvadoran students who are studying in Taiwan to the PRC .\nToo bad , on many counts . From what I understand , the kids will learn a lesser Chinese on the mainland \u2014 choked with ugly Communist abbreviations and such . ( The Soviets debased Russian , too . )\n\u2022 I highly recommend this article by Stephen F. Hayes , \u201c Rand Paul , Russian Stooge. \u201d I understand the sympathy that authoritarian-minded people have for Putin \u2019 s Kremlin . But Libertarians for Putin ? That \u2019 s downright weird . Kind of like Vegetarians for Lamb Chops .\nOr is Rand Paul authentically libertarian ? I \u2019 m not even a libertarian and I feel I have to defend the libertarians against the charge that Paul is one of them . . .\n\u2022 Milo\u0161 Zeman is the president of the Czech Republic . This is a big year for that country : the 50th anniversary of the Prague Spring and the subsequent Soviet invasion , which snuffed out the spring . There are commemorative ceremonies , of course .\nBut the president won \u2019 t be appearing at them . Why ? He is a big Putin man , and he would not want Putin to be offended . ( To read an article on the subject , go here . )\nThere are many things to say , one of which is this : We are constantly told \u2014 and rightly \u2014 that there \u2019 s a big difference between the Soviet Union and Russia , even under Putin . Fine . So . . . why would Putin be offended by a ceremony commemorating the Prague Spring and the Soviet invasion ?\nMaybe Putin & Co. are more Soviet than one would like to think . . .\nSome of my friends on the right are pro-Zeman because they are anti-EU , and they hope that Zeman will lead the Czech Republic out of the EU , which would hasten the demise of the union , which these friends devoutly wish for . I am anti-Zeman because I am anti-Putin , anti-dictatorship , anti-illiberalism \u2014 and Zeman is a Putin man , for sure .\n\u2022 There are also Putin women in power \u2014 and I don \u2019 t mean in Russia . Take Karin Kneissl ( please ) . She is the Austrian foreign minister , recently married . Putin attended her wedding and danced with her . She curtsied fondly . Kneissl was nominated for her post by the ( sickeningly named ) Freedom party , founded by SS men . Needless to say , this party has a friendship-and-cooperation agreement with Putin , back in the homeland . Salvini \u2019 s party in Italy \u2014 the League \u2014 has the same agreement .\n\u2022 The word \u201c evil \u201d is the \u201c strongest of all epithets , \u201d as Norman Podhoretz once wrote , and it certainly applies to the Chinese dictatorship . This piece tells how the dictatorship induces Uyghurs abroad to spy on their own . ( If they refuse to spy , the dictatorship will do bad things to their families , stuck at home . )\nThe piece is by Megha Rajagopalan , an American who is one of the best reporters in all of China . Actually , she had some news the other day : \u201c In May , China \u2019 s Foreign Ministry declined to issue me a new journalist visa . They say this is a process thing , we are not totally clear why . \u201d\nLet me put it this way : If I were a dictatorship , I wouldn \u2019 t want Megha around either . She is invaluable . And she will keep up her work , from elsewhere .\n\u2022 For decades , Canadians have liked to vacation in Cuba \u2014 which is why I particularly appreciated this article by Aedan O \u2019 Connor , saying : Don \u2019 t .\n\u2022 A headline , stomach-turning : \u201c Saudi Arabia seeks its first death penalty against a female human rights activist. \u201d ( Article here . ) The United States and other Saudi allies are not without leverage . They/we should use it .\n\u2022 Did you see this one from President Trump , last Saturday ? \u201c All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction , China . But in the end , if we are smart , tough and well prepared , we will get along with everyone ! \u201d The point is not to get along \u2014 the point is to defend and promote the American interest , period .\nSometimes \u2014 wouldn \u2019 t ya know ? \u2014 the interests of anti-American dictators clash with the interests of America . . .\n\u2022 Another one from Trump , issued Sunday : \u201c Study the late Joseph McCarthy , because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby ! Rigged Witch Hunt ! \u201d Uh-oh . Trump dissing Tailgunner Joe ? This could cause a rupture in The Base . . .\n\u2022 Two years ago , I wrote a piece called \u201c Killing Aida. \u201d It was about the clash \u2014 the fatal clash \u2014 between identity politics and art . Daniel Hannan has written a brilliant piece on essentially the same topic . Here is a nugget from it :\n\u201c Sierra Boggess , who was to have starred as Maria in the BBC Proms production of West Side Story , withdrew from the role after critics complained that the part should be reserved for a singer of Latin American background . \u201d\nOh , gim me a break ( and I \u2019 m being as polite as I can ) . Leonard Bernstein cast Kiri the Kiwi \u2014 Dame Kiri Te Kanawa \u2014 in the part . And he wrote the [ expletive deleted ] thing .\n\u2022 Trending on Twitter in recent days has been \u201c Make a Disney song sexy \u201d \u2014 that is , an invitation to do it . This made me see red . Isn \u2019 t the world sexed up enough ? Is there a blade of grass , or a speck of dust , that has not yet been sexualized ?\nI think of something Bill Buckley once said of Norman Mailer : If only he \u2019 d lift his gaze above the world \u2019 s groin .\n\u2022 An obituary from the New York Times\u2014 of Rita Borsellino , whose brother , a prosecutor , was murdered by the mafia . This made her an anti-mafia crusader . What is so valuable as a person who stands up to bullies ? Especially murderous ones .\n\u2022 Here is an obit of David McReynolds , a Socialist activist , who died at 88 . I thought these paragraphs were fascinating :\nMr. McReynolds resigned from the Socialist Party in 2015 after he was censured for two comments he had made on social media . In one , he expressed concern over Islamist extremism following a terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo , a newspaper in Paris . In the other , he used the word \u201c thuggish \u201d in reference to Michael Brown , the unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . \u201c The failure of the Socialist Party , its tendency to substitute a kind of left rhetoric for serious analysis , is to be regretted because if ever we needed a democratic socialist movement it is today , \u201d Mr. McReynolds wrote after his resignation .\nNo one \u2014 not even the venerably Left \u2014 can escape censure by PC cops .\n\u2022 This is a painful , painful obit of Isamu Shibayama . I had never known about the Peruvian side of Japanese internment , so to speak . A tragic , maddening story .\n\u2022 My old friend from The Weekly Standard , Jonathan V. Last , tweeted , \u201c . . . this is one of the most gracious displays of intellectual honesty you \u2019 ll ever see. \u201d He was linking to this article : \u201c Rod Was Right and I Was Wrong . \u201d\nI was working with Rod Dreher here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 during the period in question . Rod was determined to find the truth , and tell it . A lot of people didn \u2019 t like this very much . He was lion-like , unbullyable . You want that kind of person in journalism , and in life .\nThank you , dearhearts \u2014 this was a long one , wasn \u2019 t it ?
