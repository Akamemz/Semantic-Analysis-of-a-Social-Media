    "content": "Last time I saw former Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell , he was sashaying around Tampa , Fla. , in 2012 as though we 'd see him again , big time , in 2016 . Elected with Chris Christie in that 2009 statehouse rebuke to President Obama , he \u2019 d been a rising star , tapped to make the 2010 GOP State of the Union reply and an opening night convention address in Tampa . He made sure to shake my hand as I replaced him in the shared CNBC/MSNBC makeup cubby off the convention floor . Good times . Now McDonnell \u2019 s only thoughts of 2016 are making sure he doesn \u2019 t spend it in prison , as he fights public corruption charges for taking an estimated $ 165,000 in gifts from a grifting donor .\nMeanwhile his class of 2009 buddy Chris Christie looks at McDonnell and has to worry : the wheels of justice turn slowly , but they turn , and they are inexorably turning now for Christie \u2013 lots of them . Between the genuine George Washington Bridge retribution scandal involving his closest aides , and newer charges that his lieutenant governor threatened to use Sandy aid as payback if Hoboken \u2019 s mayor blocked a Christie donor \u2019 s development deal , the New Jersey governor is vulnerable on more fronts than McDonnell ever was , though to be fair , investigators aren \u2019 t in Christie 's kitchen \u2013 not yet , anyway .\nSo concern-troll Hillary Clinton all you want , Beltway pundits . You \u2019 re missing the only 2016 story that matters , and not surprisingly , it involves a lot of you . The mainstream media fantasy of a remarkably \u201c deep bench \u201d of 2016 contenders for the GOP was never founded in reality \u2013 but such a bench , if it ever existed , is surely in splinters today .\nThat \u201c deep bench \u201d metaphor , by the way , seems to have come directly from Mitt Romney \u2019 s V.P . vetter Beth Myers , although you had to ask , then and now : if the GOP bench was so deep , how did they wind up with Paul Ryan , who couldn \u2019 t even carry his home state of Wisconsin ? ( More on Ryan in a moment . )\nBut for now , let \u2019 s revisit that bench : It \u2019 s not just McDonnell ( No . 3 on the National Journal \u2019 s 2012 \u201c deep bench \u201d list for 2016 ) and Christie ( he was No . 1 ) who are finished . No . 2 contender Sen. Marco Rubio is , too : He made a play for the center with immigration reform , panicked and tacked right , and now he \u2019 s nobody \u2019 s top choice . Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal ( lucky No . 7 ! ) flamed out after telling the GOP to stop being `` the stupid party , '' then acting , well , stupidly , and becoming , by August of 2013 , the most unpopular Republican governor in the country ( and that 's saying a lot ) .\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz is n't even on the list , but he deserves some attention . He came out of nowhere in 2012 , but he \u2019 s already imploded spectacularly , going from a top-tier contender in early polls to far behind because of his self-promoting and nasty ( not to mention extremist ) brand of politics .\nSen. Rand Paul made many lists ( the National Journal 's No . 6 ) , and he still has a few admirers , especially among his father \u2019 s old fans . But Paul has proven to be a lightweight with a plagiarism problem whose one somewhat interesting attribute \u2013 his national security and foreign policy skepticism -- is politically suicidal with the GOP ( and most of the Democratic ) establishment . He will not be the GOP nominee .\nThen there 's Rep. Paul Ryan , last seen reinventing himself as a friend of the poor and a fan of Pope Francis ( even if he couldn \u2019 t resist lecturing the pope for his faulty knowledge of capitalism ) . He plays a wonk on TV , but badly ; his only contribution to the 2012 ticket was to hurt Romney . While the National Journal had Ryan at No . 5 , no defeated V.P . candidate has ever become president except FDR , and no number of loving McKay Coppins profiles will ever make Paul Ryan FDR .\nWhile we \u2019 re in Wisconsin , let \u2019 s look at Gov . Scott Walker , who \u2019 s getting a little play now that Christie is tumbling . Walker is a charisma-free Koch brothers toady who has more in common with Christie than alleged statehouse pragmatism : his own ethically challenged aides , back in Milwaukee . Three Walker associates were convicted in an earlier probe into campaign finance violations ; last October , a new investigation began . Walker was named one of the nation 's `` worst governors '' by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington . He is not ready for the glare of a national campaign .\nThat leaves Jeb Bush ( National Journal 's No . 4 * ) . He and his brother are disliked by the Tea Party , but the former Florida governor is beloved by the GOP establishment ; he could be said to embody it . But is the country ready for another Bush ? His own mother says no , and his wife , Columba , is also said to be against it . And as long as pundits insist Hillary Clinton \u2019 s ties with Wall Street could hurt her in this populist era \u2013 and they could \u2013 Bush \u2019 s will do the same thing , because they \u2019 re even closer . He went to work for doomed Lehman Brothers after leaving the governor \u2019 s mansion , because apparently Bushes are n't wealthy enough .\nThen , sadly , Florida \u2019 s state and local pension funds lost $ 1 billion when the firm went bankrupt . Bush came in for blame , since he was also on the State Board of Administration , which invests public funds , but he insists he played no role in advising public fund administrators to use Lehman . Still , the potential conflict would get new oxygen from a national race .\nSo let Larry Sabato and Ron Fournier concern-troll Hillary Clinton . It 's true , she may not run , and if she runs , she may not win . But if you want to be president in 2016 -- man or woman , black or white , Republican or Democrat -- you 'd rather be Hillary Clinton than anyone else in the world .\n* Just in case you 're curious , South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley , South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Indiana Rep. Mike Pence rounded out the National Journal list .",
