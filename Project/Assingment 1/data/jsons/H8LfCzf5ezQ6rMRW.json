But as U.S. pressure on Iran has intensified , so too has Iran deepened its ties to and reliance on its allied militias . Its goal : to increase its own strategic depth and its deterrence against Israeli and U.S. military action .\nIsrael and Iran are avowed enemies . But despite the often bellicose utterances of their leaders , the consensus among analysts has long been that neither side really wants war . The same has been said of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , one of Iran \u2019 s main allies in the region .\nJust hours after Israel said it had launched airstrikes in Syria to stop an Iranian \u201c killer drone \u201d attack , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the occupied Golan Heights \u00ad\u2013 the supposed target of the foiled Iranian barrage .\nThe premier \u2019 s visit last weekend came amid a two-day whirlwind of strikes that were either claimed by Israel or were attributed to it and were aimed at Iranian forces or their allies in Syria , Iraq , Lebanon , and the Gaza Strip .\nAs Israel and Iran surge past each other \u2019 s red lines , analysts are raising questions about how far such fresh escalations can go , short of all-out war . The region is already buckling under an array of proxy conflicts , the U.S.-Iran standoff in the Persian Gulf , and Washington \u2019 s \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign against Iran .\nMr. Netanyahu explained why Israel is now striking further afield than ever before , to thwart Iran :\n\u201c If someone comes to kill you , rise up and kill him first , \u201d he said , invoking a line from the Talmud long embraced by Israel \u2019 s security services . \u201c Any country that allows its territory to be used for attacks against Israel will bear the consequences . \u201d\nUntil now a strategic balance between Israel and Iran has prevailed \u2013 despite more than 200 Israeli airstrikes against Iranian or Iran-linked targets in Syria in recent years , most with modest or no Iranian response .\nBut as U.S. diplomatic , economic , and military pressure on Iran has intensified , so too has Iran deepened its ties to and reliance on its allied militias . Its goal : to increase its own strategic depth and its deterrence against Israeli and U.S. military action .\nIran \u2019 s moves have given it enhanced freedom of action on Israel \u2019 s doorstep \u2013 despite Russian assurances that it would keep Iranian forces back from the border in southern Syria \u2013 and an improved capacity to upgrade the missile arsenal of Hezbollah , its ally in Lebanon .\nBut if Iran \u2019 s threat perception encompasses both Israel and its superpower ally the U.S. , Israel \u2019 s gaze is focused on regional hegemon Iran and its lesser proxies .\nIts cross-regional strikes \u2013 starting with a July 19 bombing of an Iran-backed Shiite militia base near Baghdad , which reportedly struck guided missiles bound for Syria \u2013 are designed to limit Iran \u2019 s influence , raise the cost of foreign adventures for Tehran , and prevent the growth of what Israeli officials call Iran \u2019 s \u201c war machine \u201d in Syria .\nBesides four strikes in Iraq this summer \u2013 the first Israeli attacks in Iraq since its 1981 destruction of a nuclear reactor \u2013 Israel was behind a drone attack in Beirut last Sunday , which is reported to have destroyed key Iranian-made equipment for upgrading Hezbollah missile guidance systems .\nBilal Hussein/AP People listen to a speech by the Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah at a coffee shop in a southern suburb of Beirut , Lebanon , Aug. 25 , 2019 . Sheikh Nasrallah said Hezbollah will confront and shoot down Israeli drones that fly over Lebanon from now on .\n\u201c The game is relatively clear for both parties , \u201d says Nasser Hadian , a political scientist at Tehran University .\n\u201c Iran is trying to build an effective deterrence against Israelis , in Lebanon and Syria \u2013 this is the main part \u2013 and to a much lesser extent in Iraq , \u201d says Mr. Hadian . \u201c That puts Iran in an advantageous position regarding Israel , because Iranian forces and proxies \u2013 if you want to use the term \u2013 are close to Israel \u2019 s border , but the Israelis are far away from Iranian borders .\n\u201c So naturally , it \u2019 s very clear that what Israel wants is to prevent that , \u201d he says .\nIndeed , from the Israeli perspective it is military pressure against Iran \u2019 s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) in Syria that has prompted Tehran to shift operations inside the country northward and to increasingly use Lebanese and Iraqi territory .\n\u201c Israel has been quite successful in delaying or acting against Iranian attempts to come up with a strategic military infrastructure inside Syria , \u201d says Raz Zimmt , an Iran expert with the Institute for National Security Studies ( INSS ) , a think tank at Tel Aviv University .\n\u201c The Iranians are trying to adapt their strategy to the constraints in Syria and moving more activity to Lebanon and Iraq , [ which ] makes Israel realize that is has to expand its activity as well to [ those ] other fronts , \u201d he says .\n\u201c Iran is not ready to give up Syria .
