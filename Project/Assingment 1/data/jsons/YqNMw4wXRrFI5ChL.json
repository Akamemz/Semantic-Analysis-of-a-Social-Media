Back in the 1950s and '60s there was a gentlemen named Fred Stickman , a prodigious writer of letters to the editor , who railed against such government handouts as cheap electricity because it would make people lazy if they did n't have to chop firewood . In the 1970s , Joe Vogler , a full-fledged secessionist from Fairbanks , started the Alaskan Independence Party , declaring , `` I 'm an Alaskan , not an American '' ( which would have come as something of a surprise to the native Alaskans who were not born in Kansas as he was ) .\nAnd there is , of course , Sarah Palin , one of the heirs to the Alaskan political culture of Stickman and Vogler , a politician whose husband even claimed membership in the Alaskan Independence Party for several years .\nEven the `` establishment '' politicians lean somewhat eccentric , even as they are firmly in the pocket of the energy industry and the military , which dominate the state 's politics . Just recently , Rep. Don Young famously reminisced about hiring what he termed `` wetbacks '' back in the day . And it was the extremely powerful Ted Stevens who embodied the perfect dissonance of Alaskan self-image -- a powerful Washington politician totally dedicated to serving Big Oil and bringing home the federal bacon , all while declaring Alaska to be the perfect example of frontier independence and self-sufficiency .\nIf Alaskan politics is a study in contradictions , there is no greater example than the argument over climate change in the Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and his rivals in August 's Republican primary : Mead Treadwell , Dan Sullivan and the far-right gadfly in the Vogler tradition , Joe Miller of Fairbanks . .\nBegich is the `` hysterical hippie '' of the bunch simply by admitting that climate change exists .
