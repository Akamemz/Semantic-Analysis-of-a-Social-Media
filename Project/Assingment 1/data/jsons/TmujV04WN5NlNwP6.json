    "content": "Obama is focused on holding on to the Senate and picking up House seats . Dems fear Obama may cave in\nDemocrats have something else to fear after the November midterms besides just an all Republican-controlled Congress : President Barack Obama .\nWith Obama \u2019 s political career winding down and poll numbers continuing to languish , his party brethren fret that their own president \u2014 forced to work with GOP majorities \u2014 would give away the store on key policy issues ranging from the budget to energy and trade . It \u2019 s a concern congressional Democrats have voiced every time Obama and Vice President Joe Biden tried to cut big fiscal deals with Republicans \u2014 and the panic is now more palpable with the growing prospect of a Senate GOP majority .\nWashington \u2019 s current gridlock may seem destined to last forever , but divided government has produced strange bedfellows before . President George W. Bush switched teams on some key issues in his final two years after Democrats took the House and Senate , becoming a cap-and-trade convert who bailed out Wall Street . President Bill Clinton partnered with the same Republicans who impeached him to overhaul welfare and balance the budget . And President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O \u2019 Neill found common ground reforming the Tax Code and Social Security .\nWhile tackling anything comprehensive with legislation sounds far-fetched before the next president is sworn in , that doesn \u2019 t mean there won \u2019 t be moments starting after November when Obama would be tempted to negotiate with Republicans following four years of stalemate . After all , the GOP would have greater leverage . And with the White House on the line in 2016 , Republicans will also want to prove they aren \u2019 t just against Obama but actually capable of governing again .\n\u201c Clearly it \u2019 s a concern . It keeps me awake at night , \u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) . \u201c From his standpoint , better to advance the ball and maybe give away some stuff than leave nothing at all . From our standpoint , better to fight another day than give away core principles of contents and conviction . \u201d\nDemocrats on both ends of the Capitol were openly skeptical when asked about Republicans running the legislative agenda , particularly since any Senate GOP majority would still be well short of the 60-vote thresholds needed to overcome filibusters , much less the two-thirds majority to override Obama vetoes . For starters , House Republicans wouldn \u2019 t be flying solo anymore with oversight , meaning subpoena power and testy hearings on the IRS , EPA and Benghazi would be run by the likes of Sens . Chuck Grassley of Iowa on Judiciary , Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma on Environment and Public Works and John McCain of Arizona on Armed Services .\nBut it \u2019 s the prospect of what Obama might bargain on with Republicans that has Democrats really riled up .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to create nightmares where none exist right now . But certainly for the paranoid there \u2019 s plenty to fear , and maybe even just for the fearful there \u2019 s plenty to fear , \u201d Blumenthal said , while adding that he still had a \u201c basic trust in [ Obama \u2019 s ] commitments and his instincts . \u201d\nAlaska Sen. Mark Begich , one of the most endangered 2014 Democrats , has begun to warn voters back home that they may have more to fear than a GOP Senate . He \u2019 s also bluntly telling Alaska seniors that they will lose Social Security benefits , given Obama \u2019 s willingness to lower annual cost-of-living adjustments as part of past attempts at a deficit deal .\n\u201c It should worry Alaskan seniors , \u201d Begich said in an interview . Raising concerns about the consumer price index , the inflation measure used to set benefits , he added , \u201c Alaskan seniors will see a reduction in their Social Security payments because these Republicans will team up with Obama on chained CPI . Am I worried about it ? Yes . Should Alaskan seniors be worried about [ it ] ? Absolutely .\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s an example where someone might be mad at Obama . But if you \u2019 re a senior , and you \u2019 re mad at Obama today , you \u2019 ll be really mad at Obama and the Republicans because they are going to reduce your benefits , \u201d he added .\nDemocrats are mindful of how toxic some of Obama \u2019 s other proposed deals have been with the party \u2019 s base , such as the 2010 law to extend Bush-era tax cuts or his international trade deals . Indeed , Rep. Gary Peters , a Democrat running for Senate in Michigan , is openly campaigning against the president \u2019 s free-trade agenda . Others know full well that if a Republican Congress makes entitlement cuts and free trade a priority , it could put them in a bind .\n\u201c If a Republican Congress establishes a goal of working with the president on trade , it will certainly facilitate \u201d passing fast-track trade authority , said Rep. Jared Polis ( D-Colo. ) . But he also cautioned that Republicans will have some work to do since they \u2019 ve been split on trade issues as well as on issues like reforming entitlement programs .\nObama remains focused on holding on to the Senate , while picking up House seats for Democrats . But Democratic strategists note that Obama \u2019 s strategy , if he \u2019 s forced to work with Republican majorities , will be a juggling act that entails cementing his own legacy and figuring out what \u2019 s best for Hillary Clinton or whoever emerges as the 2016 front-runner .\nStill , with the prospect of Sen.
