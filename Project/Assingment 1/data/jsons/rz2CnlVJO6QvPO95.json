The economy is expected to shrink at a roughly 30 % rate in the current quarter . That would be the worst quarterly contraction , by far , since record-keeping began in 1948 . Economists do expect a snap-back in the second half of the year , though not enough to reverse all the damage .\nLast week , the number of people applying for jobless benefits declined slightly to 1.48 million . It was the 12th straight weekly drop . An additional 700,000 people applied through a program for self-employed and gig workers that made them eligible for aid for the first time . These figures aren \u2019 t adjusted for seasonal variations , so the government doesn \u2019 t include them in the official count .\nCombining those figures , overall applications for jobless aid have edged down just 3 % in the past two weeks \u2014 a much slower pace than in late April and May .\n\u201c There has been no real decline in weekly claims the past two weeks , \u201d said Julia Pollak , a labor economist at ZipRecruiter . \u201c There has also been no real increase in job openings .

Still , the pace of orders and shipments remains far below pre-pandemic levels . And excluding the volatile transportation category , so-called core orders rose only modestly , reflecting still-sluggish business investment .\nThe virus is once again squeezing companies across the economy .\nDisney is postponing the scheduled mid-July reopening of its Southern California theme parks until it receives guidelines from the state . Macy \u2019 s is cutting nearly 4,000 corporate jobs \u2014 roughly 3 % of its workforce \u2014 in response to financial strain caused by the virus .\nApple announced late Wednesday that it would re-close seven of its stores in the Houston area , which is suffering a spike in cases . Last week , it had said would re-close 11 other stores in four states . And the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants will seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , in part because of the restaurants it has been forced to close as a result of the pandemic .\nLarry Kudlow , President Donald Trump \u2019 s top economic adviser , asserted Thursday on Fox Business that the economy is rebounding quickly .\n\u201c I think the strong \u2018 V \u2019 recovery is right still there , \u201d Kudlow said , referring to the shape of a sharp rebound on a chart .\nMost private economists , though , foresee a much more tepid recovery .

On Wednesday , the nation set a high for new confirmed coronavirus cases . Many states are establishing their own new peaks for confirmed daily infections , including Arizona , California , Mississippi , Nevada , Texas and Oklahoma .

And if not , consumers may choose to shop , eat out , and travel less .\nTexas Gov . Greg Abbott said Thursday that that state will suspend its business reopenings amid a surge in coronavirus infections .\nReal time data on small businesses suggests that the job market \u2019 s improvement slowed in June compared with May , when 2.5 million jobs were unexpectedly added . About 78 % of small businesses have reopened as states have lifted shutdown orders , according to data from Homebase , a company that provides scheduling and time-tracking software to small businesses .
