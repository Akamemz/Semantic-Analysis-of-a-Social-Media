Human Rights Council to promote universal respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in a fair and equal manner .\nThe 12-year-old council is deeply flawed , inconsistent , heavily biased against Israel , and plagued by a membership list that includes some of the world \u2019 s worst human rights violators and dictatorships .

Even European governments and human rights groups have opposed the U.S. reform effort out of fear that countries hostile to human rights would seize the opportunity to weaken the Human Rights Council further \u2013 if that was even possible .\nThis is a self-fulfilling prophesy that condemns the Human Rights Council to its gravely disappointing , biased and inefficient status quo .

Watch , as of the end of last month the Human Rights Council had adopted 80 condemnatory resolutions against Israel out of 169 overall against countries deemed human rights abusers \u2013 47 percent of the total .\nThe Human Rights Council also has convened 28 special sessions devoted to human rights and other abuses , with eight ( 29 percent ) focused on Israel .
