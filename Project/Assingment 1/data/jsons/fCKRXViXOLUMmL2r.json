The state has contracted with a private company to move severely ill prisoners -- who are being paroled or released from prison for medical or compassionate reasons -- into a former nursing home that sits right behind their house .\n`` It 's prisoners living next door , and it 's not one or two of them . It 's 95 of them , '' said Josh Egan . `` We 're going to call it what it is . It 's not a nursing home , it 's a prison . They are prisoners , coming from prison . My grandmother is in a nursing home . This is definitely not where I 'd send my grandmother . ''\nThe facility has been vacant for about a year and a half . The state has contracted to funnel what it says are the most debilitated prisoners -- those at the end of life ; suffering from Alzheimer 's disease or dementia ; or otherwise incapable of caring for themselves -- to the nursing home . By doing so , they estimate they will save about $ 6 million of state taxpayer money in prisoner health costs . When inmates who require 24-hour skilled nursing care are incarcerated , the state picks up the whole tab . Yet if the prisoners are moved to a nursing facility , the federal Medicaid program pays 50 percent of the cost , though that still represents money provided by taxpayers .\nBut that is little comfort to the neighbors whose homes surround the property the nursing home sits on .\n`` I 'm really mad , '' said Tony Fabi , whose backyard abuts the nursing home . `` My kid ca n't even play in the back yard , thinking that someone might escape , jump over a stockade fence that they are putting up . Are you kidding me ? ''\nNicole Crawford said she is `` horrified , to put it bluntly . ... I would not let my children play in the yard . I would n't feel safe letting them play in the one place they should feel safe , in their own yard . ''\n`` It is something that is going on in every state , and we are just trying to have an efficient way to make referrals and place these inmates in a nursing home , '' insists Mike Lawlor , Connecticut 's under secretary of criminal justice policy and planning , who is the state 's point man on the issue .\nLawlor said that he understands `` that the neighbors are apprehensive , and they have every right to be apprehensive , '' but he insists that the prisoners will pose no threat to anyone , citing their severe medical conditions .\n`` If there is a danger , they wo n't be placed here or in any other community-based residential program . ... These are very , very sick people . There are plenty of very , very sick people who continue to pose a danger that we would not consider for such a placement , but there are sick people who , by any medical or criminal justice analysis , no longer pose a threat to anybody and those are the ones who would be in the facility . ''\nHe said some of the patients are not mobile , and also notes that there is a locked unit for dementia patients , with security and two parole officers who will be on site .\n`` We release people like this to nursing homes all the time , '' Lawlor noted , saying that last year 20 patients were sent to various homes across the state , while 16 prisoners died waiting for transfer .\nWith the nation 's aging prison population , `` the number in this category is getting bigger and it is a little easier to do it if you have set aside a dedicated nursing home . ''\nHowever the state 's assurances are not enough for the town , and neighbors are not convinced the residents wo n't be a danger .\n`` These are not people who belong in a convalescent home , they belong in a prison , '' said Rocky Hill 's Acting Mayor Timothy Moriarty . `` They say that they are at the end of life , but you know what ? They committed a crime and they should do the time . ''\nThe town has filed suit to challenge the state plan , claiming the facility owners did not get the proper approval from the town in order to operate .\n`` This is something that just came out of nowhere , we were n't warned about it or even approached about it , we just found out about it in the 11th hour , '' Moriarty said of the state 's plan . `` It seems like there was something , you know , swept under the carpet here to try to make this thing happen without us being aware of it . ''\nThe owner of the home has filed a motion to dismiss the town 's lawsuit , and Lawlor insists the operator followed normal procedure to gain approval to open as a nursing home . He notes , though , the owner did not disclose plans to contract with the state to accept patients from prisons and the mental health hospital .\n`` There is nothing about this nursing home that will be different than a regular nursing home , '' Lawlor said .\nMeanwhile , the construction workers are busy preparing the facility for its new patients , who will receive similar nursing care as the former residents . There is a carpeted dining hall , fenced in outdoor space and the expected medical equipment of any nursing home .\nThe nursing home 's license could come from the state Department of Health at any time , and soon after the first patients could arrive .",
