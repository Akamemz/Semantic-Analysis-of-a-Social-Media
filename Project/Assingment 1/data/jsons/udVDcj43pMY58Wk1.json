Some more bizarre . Others seemed ill-informed . However , the most peculiar and frankly hypocritical thing I saw at the march did not happen on stage or even in the audience . The most hypocritical thing happening at the March For Our Lives took place backstage .\nEach celebrity speaker and high school activist who took the stage to give an impassioned speech condemning firearms was themselves protected by a wide arsenal of firearms .\nI personally witnessed multiple celebrities go to and from their limousines under the heavily armed guard of private security members and the Capitol Police . I watched Katie Couric , Cher , George Clooney and the student celebrities of Parkland all get escorted to safety by police officers who were visibly carrying holstered handguns . None of the speakers waived the protections of an armed officer . Every major movie star , singer or student leaving the rally rushed to the protective bubble of well armed security as they traveled from the gated backstage area to idling limousines and private cars .\nParkland student celebrities leave the march under heavily armed police guard pic.twitter.com/E2Dpq9IC0W \u2014 Benny ( @ bennyjohnson ) March 24 , 2018\nI watch this happen again and again , as armed police held back screaming fans and teenagers from harassing some of their favorite advocate-celebrities .
