Many questions on law enforcement reforms remain but one sticks out, how do we hold officers accountable for their actions?\n\nOne of the more technical concepts that has come up is \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d Some leaders in the House and Senate are recommending that this long standing doctrine either be abolished or reformed; while others want it to remain.\n\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about it. Qualified immunity protects certain government officials, including police officers, from being held personally liable for violating other people\u2019s constitutional rights in the course of their duties, and makes them immune from civil suits unless they violate \u201cclearly established law.\u201d The goal is to protect public officials from the expense and distraction of litigation, and from the danger that they will not be able to appropriately perform their duties out of fear of being sued.\n\n\n\nA QUICK NOTE: Qualified immunity is a legal concept that is highly technical in its application. This newsletter is meant to give a brief overview of the topic and controversy, and therefore purposely avoids many of the legal intricacies of qualified immunity. To better understand qualified immunity, we recommend leveraging the source links for more detailed legal explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Qualified Immunity?\n\nQualified immunity is a type of legal immunity that shields government officials from lawsuits that state that the defendant violated the plaintiffs rights. It does not apply in cases where a defendant's \u201cclearly established\u201d rights are violated. The law is in place to protect officials from \u201charassment, destraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\u201d The defendant is judged on whether an action was reasonable given the specific situation and whether the defendant could have reasonably known that they were violating a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional right. (Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute )\n\nA Bit of Historical Context:\n\n42 U.S.C. Section 1983 was enacted in 1871 to combat civil rights violations occurring in the South. It subjects state and local government officials to lawsuits for money damages for violating federal constitutional and statutory rights. But the Supreme Court has held qualified immunity applies if the law violated isn\u2019t \u201cclearly established.\u201d The qualified immunity doctrine is very favorable to state and local government officials. The law is rarely clear because most cases involve different facts. The Supreme Court has gone so far as to say that qualified immunity protects all but the \u201cplainly incompetent.\u201d NCSL\n\nThe Ku Klux act of 1871, the Third Enforcement Act, or the Second Ku Klux Klan act was intended \u201cto enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d (Federal Judicial Center)\n\n\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d(USLegal)\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nPolice actions and decisions in the field have been the focus of substantial research.

Body\u2010worn cameras (BWCs) are one organizationally based measure that has been strongly advocated to address these concerns.\n\nBillions of dollars are being spent worldwide on the roll-out of body-worn cameras for police officers.
