In a time when people feel they ca n't keep up or are falling behind , it 's hard to have faith in the idea that everyone can achieve a base level of security and provide for their kids to do better than they did . That was always the deal for working-class Americans , immigrants and middle-class alike .\nGenerally , people agree that the lack of social and economic mobility we see today -- necessities for the achievement of the American dream -- is a result of the dramatic income inequality that 's grown dramatically over the last couple of decades .

People who never thought of going to college had all their children graduate from university .
