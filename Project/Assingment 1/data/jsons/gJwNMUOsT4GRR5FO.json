    "content": "Republicans were unfazed by the deficit impact of their $ 1.5 trillion tax cut when they passed it . Now they are trying to make deficits unconstitutional .\nThe House is scheduled to vote on a balanced budget amendment Thursday . Though several states require their legislatures to pass a balanced budget every year , the federal government does not have the same requirement . In fact , many economists argue it \u2019 s necessary for the federal government to go into debt for the greater good of the economy . Nevertheless , balanced budget amendments are something of a white whale on the right . And many conservatives believe it is the only way to actually enact spending cuts .\nThere \u2019 s no question the United States is in a lot of debt , but Democrats are quick to point out the irony of Republicans pushing a balanced budget amendment now : On Monday , the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 the independent official body that measures the impact of legislation \u2014 reported that deficit spending will increase by $ 11.7 trillion over the next 10 years , $ 1.58 trillion of which is because of the Republican tax cuts and the omnibus spending bill .\nFor decades , Republicans have campaigned on cutting federal spending and reducing the national debt . And while there \u2019 s an ongoing debate among economists over how big an actual threat the deficit is , Republicans , now in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House , have done just the opposite .\nThe bill the House plans to vote on this Thursday would be one of the first steps in amending the US Constitution to bar the government from spending more than it brings in in federal revenue . Changing the Constitution requires approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate and then it must be passed by three-fourth of state legislatures . Republicans currently hold 32 of 50 state legislatures .\nThis is all very unlikely to happen . But Republicans are pushing it anyway . It reveals a deeply unpopular partisan agenda to make deep cuts to everything from food stamps to health care .\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have used the idea of a balanced budget amendment as a political tool for a long time .\nThe movement really started in the late 1970s , when Republicans brought up a balanced budget amendment to rein in spending under Jimmy Carter \u2019 s administration . Over time , its popularity has grown and waned on both sides of the aisle . Even California Gov . Jerry Brown , who was running against Carter for the Democratic nomination , supported it at the time . He \u2019 s since had a change of heart .\nThere was another push for a balanced budget amendment after Ronald Reagan-era tax cuts ballooned the deficit . Activist groups like the National Taxpayers Union began to push for a constitutional convention on the balanced budget amendment to achieve this goal . These groups have continued to fight for the cause . But the amendment has failed every time \u2014 in 1982 , and again in 1986 , and in 1995 , and so on . The last time Congress voted on a balanced budget amendment was in 2011 .\nNow , Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R-VA ) gets a vote on a version of this amendment . The amendment would ban deficit spending , require that spending not exceed 20 percent of gross domestic product , and require a majority to increase taxes and three-fifths majorities to raise the debt limit .\nThe basic idea is that the government won \u2019 t rein in its spending ( or raise taxes ) on its own , and only a constitutional amendment can force Congress to do it .\nBut as Slate \u2019 s Jim Newell points out , even Goodlatte \u2019 s bill gives Congress an out :\nJust after requiring that \u201c total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that year , \u201d we get a provision allowing Congress to override that \u201c unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote . \u201d\nIn other words , lawmakers can add a waiver for any extra spending they want to \u2014 something that would likely happen given the nature and history of spending negotiations .
