He has precisely zero evidence to back up that claim. But he has a remarkably receptive audience.\n\nAround 30 percent of Americans have \"little or no confidence\" that votes will be counted accurately \u2014 and Trump's voters are far less confident about that than Clinton's.\n\nThat means that potentially millions of Americans will turn out to vote on Nov. 8, despite apparently believing their votes may not count at all. But to believe the election will be \"rigged\" is to believe that any number of improbable things will happen.\n\nHere's a handful of reasons not to worry about any \"rigging\":\n\n1. The election is decentralized\n\nYes, election-rigging worked on Scandal, when a super-secret cabal of five people (including the first lady AND the White House chief of staff) flipped the election by fiddling with a single voting machine in Ohio.\n\nBut then, Campaign 2016 is not a Shonda Rhimes production. Which is to say: Rigging the election would be much, much harder than this. For one, there are a few options of where to try doing that voting-machine fiddling. Where would you begin? Ohio? Florida?

States run them themselves. Trying to twist the results in a bunch of different precincts run by different authorities would be monstrously difficult. And even if one could somehow pull it off, then there's the problem of people's big mouths.\n\n\"So, say, 400 precincts in a big conspiracy, and no one will know?\" Mebane added. \"That's not gonna happen.\"\n\n2. State officials are on guard\n\nSecretaries of state are charged with administering elections in each state. And on Monday, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, insisted that rigging won't happen.\n\n\"First of all, I can reassure Donald Trump: I am in charge of elections in Ohio, and they're not going to be rigged. I'll make sure of that,\" he told CNN. \"Our institutions, like our election system, is one of the bedrocks of American democracy. We should not question it or the legitimacy of it.

That means the rigging would have to take place under Republican administrations \u2014 people who would, theoretically, have more reason to want Trump rather than Clinton to win.\n\n3. Clinton is already leading by a lot\n\nWith a really close race, there could potentially be more of an argument that \"rigging\" the election would be possible (with irregularities in particular counties or precincts, which would be challenged and subject to recounts and oversight and courts weighing in).\n\nBut the way things look right now, that doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\n\"If the polls in November look like they do now, then I don't see much of an issue,\" Vanderbilt University political science professor Marc Hetherington told NPR in August. \"No one will find credible charges of election fraud if it looks like a blowout in advance.\"\n\nAt the time, Clinton was far ahead of Trump \u2014 she had an 83 percent chance of winning to his 17, according to FiveThirtyEight.
