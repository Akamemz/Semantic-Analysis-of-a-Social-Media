    "content": "President Trump struck back at the news media and mounted a defense of his still-young administration Thursday , saying the press was \u201c out of control \u201d with attacks on him , and that the White House was running like a \u201c fine-tuned machine . \u201d\nAt a hastily arranged press conference , Mr. Trump accused news organizations of ignoring his successes and attempting to undermine him with \u201c fake news , \u201d saying that much of the news media was working to protect the special interests and status quo in Washington that he was elected to destroy .\n\u201c The media \u2019 s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made , and they \u2019 re not happy about it , \u201d he said at the freewheeling press conference , where he answered questions from a variety of new outlets for more than an hour .\n\u201c I see [ news ] stories of chaos , chaos , yet it is the exact opposite , \u201d said Mr. Trump . \u201c This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine despite the fact that I can \u2019 t get my Cabinet approved . \u201d\nHe rattled off early successes , including the record highs in the stock market , major companies such as Ford opting to keep factories in the U.S. , the cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and ordering the Pentagon to devise new plans to destroy the Islamic State .\nMr. Trump said he called the press conference to \u201c take my message straight to the people . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Chris Collins : Donald Trump \u2018 relaxed , \u2019 \u2018 focused , \u2019 but frustrated with the news media\nThe president chose to put himself in front of the White House press corps amid a tumultuous week .\nHis nominee for labor secretary , fast-food executive Andrew Puzder , withdrew his nomination Wednesday due to dwindling support from Senate Republicans .\nMr. Trump forced his national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , to resign Monday because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition .\nMr. Trump had previously blamed Mr. Flynn \u2019 s downfall on the news media and illegal leaks from the intelligence community that exposed his erroneous statements denying he talked to the ambassador about U.S. sanctions against Russia .\nHe said the relentless news stories about his alleged connections with Russia were a \u201c ruse . \u201d\nStill , the rough week and the confusion that followed the rollout of his executive order for an extreme vetting program bellied his claims of the administration performing like a \u201c fine-tuned machine . \u201d\nHe also claimed the rollout of extreme vetting to temporarily halt visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries , which was suspended by federal court rulings , was \u201c very smooth . \u201d\n\u201c Let me tell you about the travel ban . We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban . But we had a bad court . Got a bad decision , \u201d he said .\nMr. Trump opened the press conference by announcing his new pick to run the Labor Department , former National Labor Relations Board member R. Alexander Acosta . But he quickly launched into his rebuke of the news media .\nMaking a case for his early successes , the president said the news media had underreported the \u201c mess \u201d he inherited from President Obama .\n\u201c As you know , our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy , \u201d he said . \u201c To be honest , I inherited a mess . It \u2019 s a mess . At home and abroad , a mess . \u201d\nListing problems that include jobs leaving the U.S. , threats of North Korea and the \u201c disaster \u201d in the Middle East , the president vowed to fix all of it . \u201c We \u2019 re going to take care of it all . I just want to let you know , I inherited a mess , \u201d he said .\nPredicting that the news media would distort his actions during the press conference , Mr. Trump said he could imagine headlines declaring : \u201c Donald Trump rants and raves at the press . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not ranting and raving . I \u2019 m just telling you . You know , you \u2019 re dishonest people , \u201d he told reporters gathered in the East Room of the White House . \u201c But I \u2019 m not ranting and raving . I love this . I \u2019 m having a good time doing it . \u201d\nIndeed , Mr. Trump relished sparring with reporters at the unconventional White House event that harked back to his face-offs with the press on the campaign trail .\nIn another nod to his wild run for presidency , Mr. Trump will hold a campaign-style rally Saturday at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport in Melbourne , Florida .\n\u201c I just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the press conference .\nRichard Benedetto , a scholar on the relationships between the White House and the press , said that he was not surprised by Mr. Trump \u2019 s aggressive push back against the new media .\n\u201c President Trump feels , with some credibility , that he is under siege by the news media , \u201d said Mr. Benedetto , a journalism professor at American University . \u201c Just check the headlines . And he knows that if he doesn \u2019 t fight back , no one else will come to his defense .\n\u201c It might not win many converts , but it appeals to his base , which is all he has right now . When a president \u2019 s job approval falls below 40 percent , it signals that his base is eroding . He is at 40 percent , \u201d said the professor .\nThe White House press corps bristled at the criticism and pounced when Mr. Trump made an erroneous claim that his Electoral College victory was the largest since Ronald Reagan .\nIn fact , Mr. Trump \u2019 s 304 electoral votes were surpassed by the winner in five of the seven other post-Reagan elections .\nHowever , Mr. Trump has regularly made the claim that his Electoral College victory was the largest for a Republican since Reagan , with is closer to the truth . The last Republican with a larger win was President George H.W . Bush , with 426 electoral votes in 1988 .\n\u201c Why should Americans trust you ? \u201d asked a TV news reporter after noting the discrepancies .\n\u201c Well , I don \u2019 t know , I was given that information , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c I actually , I \u2019 ve seen that information around . But it was a very substantial victory . Do you agree with that ? \u201d\nThe president singled out several news organizations for ridicule , including The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and CNN .\nIn an exchange with a CNN reporter , Mr. Trump said the network \u2019 s evening anchor had \u201c hatred and venom coming from his mouth . \u201d\nMr. Trump also clashed with a reporter from the Jewish news magazine Ami who asked about the increase of anti-Semitic incidents in recent weeks .\nAngered by the perceived insinuation that he was anti-Semitic , Mr. Trump said that was \u201c not a fair question . \u201d\n\u201c So here \u2019 s the story , folks . Number one , I am the least anti-Semitic person that you \u2019 ve ever seen in your entire life . Number two , racism , the least racist person , \u201d said Mr. Trump , who shouted down the reporter when he attempted to interject .\n\u201c Quiet , quiet , quiet , \u201d said Mr. Trump . \u201c See , he lied about [ that ] . He was gon na get up and ask a very straight , simple question . So you know , welcome to the world of the media . But let me just tell you something \u2014 that I hate the charge . I find it repulsive . \u201d\nHe also appeared to offend a black reporter who asked about Mr. Trump \u2019 s plans to help inner cities and whether he would seek input from the Congressional Black Caucus .\n\u201c I tell you what , do you want to set up the meeting ? \u201d he asked April Ryan , a reporter from American Urban Radio Networks .\nWhen Ms. Ryan said no , Mr. Trump asked , \u201c Are they friends of yours ? \u201d\nThe exchange was characterized as racist across Twitter and the news reports .\nIn an earlier response to the same reporter , Mr. Trump said that he would soon sign an executive order in support of Historically Black Colleges and Universities .\nHe also pledged to make good on his campaign promise to improve education , reduce crime and expand job opportunities in American \u2019 s urban communities .\n\u201c I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c I think it \u2019 s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African-American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get .
