    "content": "President Obama is being accused of selectively quoting Usama bin Laden , by using a snippet of an anti-America screed to make it sound like Al Qaeda was breaking under the weight of the U.S. drone program .\nObama quoted the Al Qaeda leader during his wide-ranging speech on counterterrorism policy last Thursday in Washington . As part of his argument in defense of the lethal drone program , Obama suggested bin Laden himself deemed the strikes to be effective .\n`` Do n't take my word for it , '' Obama said . `` In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden 's compound , we found that he wrote , 'We could lose the reserves to enemy 's airstrikes . We can not fight airstrikes with explosives . ' ''\nIt is without question that the strikes have killed key terror leaders , and have changed the way Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate . The bin Laden document Obama referenced said as much .\nBut the document -- one of several bin Laden writings published by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center -- showed bin Laden discussing how drones strikes have changed his organization 's tactics , not necessarily how they have Al Qaeda on the run .\nThe document , which refers repeatedly to the `` ummah , '' or Muslim population , says : `` The Ummah should put forward some , but enough , forces to fight America . The Ummah must keep some of its forces on reserve . This will be in the Ummah 's best interests . The Ummah will use the reserve in the future , but during the appropriate time .\n`` In the meanwhile , we do not want to send the reserves to the front line , especially in areas where the enemy only uses airstrikes to attack our forces . So , the reserves will not , for the most part , be effective in such conflicts . Basically , we could lose the reserves to enemy 's airstrikes . We can not fight air strikes with explosives ! ''\nThe document goes on to say that `` we still have a powerful force which we can organize and prepare for deployment . ''\nThomas Joscelyn , a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , argued that bin Laden 's full quote has a far different meaning than that conveyed by the excerpt Obama cited last week .\n`` When you look at the context of the whole statement , it does n't support their story , '' he told FoxNews.com .\nHe acknowledged that the drones have killed senior terrorists , but said `` it 's just more complicated than that . ''\nJoscelyn wrote in The Weekly Standard : `` The full quote actually supports a different argument -- that al Qaeda 's 'reserves ' have been removed from the drones ' kill box . It is quite obvious that improvised explosive devices , car bombs , small arms and the like can not take out unmanned drones . So , Al Qaeda has simply moved some of its forces elsewhere . ''\nJoscelyn said the `` selective citation '' speaks to a broader problem -- `` the president and his administration only see what they want to see in the fight against Al Qaeda and affiliates groups . ''\nIn his counterterrorism speech , Obama said the `` core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat , '' while at the same time acknowledging Al Qaeda affiliates continue to threaten U.S. interests .\nObama vowed to put new limits on the U.S. drone program , while defending the need for it in an unconventional war .\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham , speaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' accused Obama of `` sounding retreat '' in the address .\n`` At the end of the day , this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine , '' he said .\nOther lawmakers praised Obama for taking new steps to disclose details about the U.S. drone program .\n`` I am also encouraged that the administration is taking steps to improve transparency as it pertains to the use of lethal force , particularly when it comes to the possible targeting of U.S. citizens , '' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , said last week .",
