But even if his behavior were diagnosed as an illness , what would that tell us that we don \u2019 t already know ? Plenty of people with mental disorders or disabilities function at high levels of society . Conversely , if Mr. Trump were found to have no diagnosable illness , he would be no more fit for the office he holds than he is today .\nThe problem lies in trying to locate the essence of Mr. Trump \u2019 s unfitness in the unknowable reaches of his mind , as opposed to where we can all openly see it and address it in political terms . As the psychiatrist Allen Frances told The Times : \u201c You can \u2019 t say enough about how incompetent and unqualified he is to be leader of the free world . But that does not make him mentally ill . \u201d\nUnfortunately , a number of psychiatrists , politicians and others who should know better have increasingly taken up the Trump-is-crazy line . In \u201c The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump , \u201d released last October , more than two dozen contributors , most mental-health professionals , concluded that Mr. Trump presents a grave and immediate danger to the safety of America and the world . No argument there , but why do we need to hear it from psychiatrists relying on their professional credentials ?
