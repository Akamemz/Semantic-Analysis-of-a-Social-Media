The British embassy described the conversation between Darroch and Spicer as \u201c private \u201d .\nThe flurry of transatlantic damage-limitation is the latest wave of fallout from the president \u2019 s early morning tweet on 4 March , claiming Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones .\nDonald J.

This is McCarthyism !\nThe claim has been rejected by the Obama administration \u2019 s intelligence chief , James Clapper , and by leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress . But Trump , and his spokesman , have persevered with the allegation .\nOn Thursday , Spicer read from a series of press reports that he claimed supported the wiretapping allegation .

He is due to appear before the House intelligence committee on Monday .\nSir Malcolm Rifkind , the former chair of parliament \u2019 s intelligence and security committee , demanded the White House withdraw the allegations and not merely say they would not be repeated . He said Spicer never had evidence for the allegations and made them only because he was desperate to justify Trump \u2019 s claim .\nHe told BBC radio : \u201c That \u2019 s just foolish and very dangerous stuff and President Trump better get a grip not only on his own press officer but on the kind of encouragement being given in the White House that makes a press officer make these stupid allegations in the first place .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t just quote from a Fox News report if you are the president \u2019 s official spokesman unless you have taken the trouble to find out if that report is justified . \u201d\nDonald Trump and the \u2018 rise \u2019 of scare \u2018 quotes \u2019 Read more\nTim Farron , leader of the Liberal Democrats , described Spicer \u2019 s repetition of the claims as \u201c shameful \u201d and said Trump was \u201c compromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment \u201d .\nSpicer had quoted Napolitano \u2019 s allegations in an effort to validate Trump \u2019 s unfounded claim that Obama tapped his phones last year .
