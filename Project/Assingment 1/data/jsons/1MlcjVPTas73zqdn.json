That official \u201c was not a subject of the investigation , \u201d the report noted .\nThe report also said that the inspector found no \u201c documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation \u201d influenced FBI decisions to open investigations of Trump campaign associates , to use confidential sources interact with them , and to seek authority to surveil Page .\nStill , Horowitz \u2019 s findings about the Carter Page surveillance authorization will likely cheer Trump and his allies , who have long argued that the FBI abused its power in investigating people linked to his 2016 presidential campaign . Attorney General Bill Barr praised the investigation but appeared to dispute one of its conclusions .\n\u201c The Inspector General \u2019 s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that , in my view , were insufficient to justify the steps taken , \u201d the attorney general said in a statement . \u201c It is also clear that , from its inception , the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory . Nevertheless , the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump \u2019 s administration . \u201d\nAn attorney for former FBI Director Andrew McCabe said his client was unaware of the problems cited by Horowitz in the report .\n\u201c Mr . McCabe did not know about any of these issues and the report makes clear that there is no way he could have known unless someone specifically brought them to his attention , \u201d lawyer Michael Bromwich said . \u201c The report makes clear that no one did . \u201d\nHorowitz announced on March 28 , 2018 , that he was launching a review to scrutinize DOJ and FBI compliance with legal and procedural requirements when seeking authorization to surveil \u201c a certain U.S. person. \u201d His announcement also said he would scrutinize the FBI \u2019 s relationship with an \u201c alleged source . \u201d\nThe U.S. person is known to be Page , who served as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign for a brief period . The surveillance began after he parted ways with the campaign . And the alleged source is Christopher Steele , a former British intelligence officer who wrote a series of memos during the 2016 campaign about relationships between denizens of Trump World and Russian nationals . The Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign paid for Steele \u2019 s work through the research firm Fusion GPS .\nThe review generated fervid speculation from the president \u2019 s allies over the last 18 months , many of whom predicted the final report would show gross wrongdoing by the bureau .\nEarlier this year , Barr told a congressional committee that he believed the Intelligence Community may have spied on the Trump campaign .\n\u201c I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s a big deal . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not suggesting that those rules were violated , \u201d he continued , \u201c but I think it \u2019 s important to look at that . I \u2019 m not talking about the FBI necessarily but intelligence agencies more broadly . \u201d\nThe comments left American intelligence officials distressed , as Barr appeared to be co-signing Trump \u2019 s claims that he was the victim of gross wrongdoing during the 2016 campaign .\nThe FBI began a counterintelligence investigation that included Trump World figures after an Australian diplomat alerted the FBI to a conversation he had with George Papadopoulos .
