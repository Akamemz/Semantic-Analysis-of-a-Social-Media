    "content": "As a $ 15 minimum wage becomes a rallying cry for presidential candidates and popular movements across the nation , House Democrats have yet to pass the minimum wage hike they campaigned on .\nWhile the majority is unified in believing the federal minimum wage should be higher , they don \u2019 t yet agree on the magic numbers . A $ 15 minimum wage bill that was on the fast track to the House floor just a couple of weeks ago now looks stuck . A dozen Democrats have signed on to an alternative plan that would raise the minimum wage more gradually in some areas of the country than the version endorsed by top Democrats , which would increase the federal minimum wage to $ 15 everywhere by 2024 .\nThe backdrop to all of this is a longstanding debate among economists about the merits of hiking the wage floor in America . It used to be taken for granted that raising the minimum wage would lead to a reduction in low-wage jobs . Employment among teenagers especially would go down . Landmark research undertaken in the 1970s had proven it .\nBut progressive economists have challenged these assumptions with new data . Dozens of Democratic-held cities and states went have increased the minimum wage floor over the years anyway , well above the long-obsolete current federal minimum of $ 7.25 an hour . A new highly anticipated study suggests the worst-feared consequences of minimum wage hikes did not come to pass . Employment did not decrease in places where wages went up , and there was actually a residually positive effect on wages for other lower-income workers .\nThe academic debate isn \u2019 t over , obviously . Some economists wonder whether there are other , possibly temporary factors in the labor market that are keeping employment afloat even with these minimum wage hikes . Maybe the economy in some places is hot enough to withstand the negative effects .\nIn the meantime , House Democrats are working to put aside those wonky differences and push through a plan they consider to be a pillar of their economic agenda .\nThe idea that minimum wage hikes lead to job losses for less skilled workers became mainstream with a 1981 report by the Labor Department . The general rule has been that for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage , there would be a 1 to 2 percent reduction in low-skill jobs .\nDavid Neumark , writing at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , summarized the longstanding consensus like this , while also citing more recent studies , in 2015 :\nThe overall body of recent evidence suggests that the most credible conclusion is a higher minimum wage results in some job loss for the least-skilled workers\u2014with possibly larger adverse effects than earlier research suggested .\nBut since the 1990s , a competing strand of thinking has gained a foothold , using its own studies to argue minimum wage hikes did not have the adverse effects that had been feared . It started with David Card and Alan Krueger , who studied worker pay at fast-food joints in New Jersey , in 1994 . The new research from UMass Amherst \u2019 s Doruk Cengiz and Arindrajit Dube , the Economic Policy Institute \u2019 s Ben Zipperer , and the University College London \u2019 s Atilla Lindner is the latest volley from that latter school of thought .\nThey looked at 138 times a state had raised its minimum wage and studied for employment effects \u2014 and they didn \u2019 t really find any . Sectors in which jobs can be more easily moved overseas , like manufacturing , did experience a drop . But the general trend was negligible . The two-sentence summary :\nWe find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over five years following the increase . At the same time , the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution .\n( It \u2019 s worth noting there is a very technical methodological debate among economists that we won \u2019 t delve into , except to say those researchers who have found no employment effects use a study design of which other economists are skeptical . )\nLeft-leaning economists have an explanation for why this could be : Companies with real market-setting capability had been paying their workers below-value wages . Think of a one-company town . Workers don \u2019 t have other options ( except to move ) , so the company has a ton of leverage in setting pay and can negotiate pretty low wages and make more money for the business . When the minimum wage is raised , they have to increase their workers \u2019 pay , but they don \u2019 t suddenly become insolvent .\n\u201c In those cases , the reason minimum wage won \u2019 t have large employment effects is it \u2019 s just eating into economic profit , \u201d Ernie Tedeschi , an analyst at Evercore ISI who worked in the Treasury Department under President Obama , explained . \u201c Employers are skimming less off the top . \u201d\nThis would be a boon for people advocating for a higher minimum wage . States have managed to increase people \u2019 s pay without costing people jobs . House Democrats consider raising the minimum wage a foundation of their economic platform . The bill increasing the federal minimum wage to $ 15 by 2024 passed out of a House committee in March , on its way to the floor , a top priority for the new majority .\nBut not everybody is sold yet on a nationwide $ 15 minimum wage \u2014 including those dozen House Democrats .\nWhy some people are still wary about raising the minimum wage\nIt \u2019 s not as if politicians like Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell , the author of the alternative Democratic House bill that sets a minimum wage on a more regional basis , oppose higher minimum wages . But they see reason for caution in the research that had previously found employment losses .\n\u201c Any statement other than \u2018 this is a contested area of academic research and we don \u2019 t know the answer yet \u2019 is highly misleading , \u201d Neumark told me . \u201c And $ 15 is really unknown territory . \u201d\nEconomists who are skeptical of the new research showing no job losses question whether the methodology being used is tuned to pick up the right signals in the economy . Or , they posit , there is something else happening in the labor market to offset whatever negative effect the minimum wage hikes have had . A strong local economy , for example , could prove resistant to the labor market pressures of a higher minimum wage .\nTedeschi gave an example of what motivates this kind of thinking . \u201c Seattle has a really good economy . If you raise the minimum wage in a really hot labor market , companies can take it . \u201d\nBut there are concerns about leaving certain places behind with a more piecemeal approach . Tedeschi noted that 21 states default to the federal minimum wage , which is currently stuck at $ 7.25 and has barely budged for years . The risk of regional variance is that the disparities that already exist just get locked in .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s being driven by state and local policy , lots of people are left behind , \u201d he said .\nThe tension is real here : The areas that most need a strong federal minimum wage , where local political leaders aren \u2019 t likely to increase it on their own , could also end up the most vulnerable to adverse effects . Because it \u2019 s not as if there is no limit to how much you can raise the minimum wage .\nTedeschi noted that some researchers believe there is a kind of magic threshold for a minimum wage : As long as it \u2019 s no more than 60 percent of the median wage in a given area , then there will be negligible harm to the job market . But if it \u2019 s higher than 60 percent , it could become too much of a burden . A notable study in Seattle found that an initial wage hike from $ 9.47 to $ 11 didn \u2019 t reduce jobs , but employment for the lowest-skilled jobs did start to drop after a subsequent increase to $ 13 .\nDemocrats agree on goals , but they \u2019 re still learning to legislate\nHouse Democrats had been coalescing behind a $ 15 minimum wage plan , with a bill passing out of committee in early March .

It has more than 200 co-sponsors .\nBut there is now a competing bill , introduced by Sewell , vice chair of the moderate and \u201c pro-growth \u201d New Democrat Coalition , and sponsored by a dozen of the more moderate House Democrats . ( Sewell is also , notably , from Alabama , where the cost of living lags far behind places like New York and San Francisco , which have hiked their minimum wages to $ 15 . ) Sewell \u2019 s bill would eventually raise the minimum wage everywhere to $ 15 \u2014 but not nearly as quickly as the bill that had been moving through the House .\nHalf of the 12 co-sponsors on Sewell \u2019 s bill are new members from competitive districts .
