But Clinton \u2019 s own refusal to give up in 2008 , even after she had no real path forward , remains an obstacle to ramping up that pressure .\nIndeed , some veterans of Clinton \u2019 s 2008 campaign are urging empathy and space for Sanders , emphasizing that the decision to slog on is not about having a viable path forward \u2014 it \u2019 s about feeling that you \u2019 ve gone as far as you can go .\nAt rallies , \u201c women would literally grab her hand say , \u2018 don \u2019 t you dare drop out , don \u2019 t you quit , \u2019 \u201d recalled Howard Wolfson , Clinton \u2019 s former communications director , of the 2008 end game . \u201c Your head told you the math didn \u2019 t add up , but your heart said , we \u2019 re continuing to win states , we \u2019 re continuing to draw big crowds , and it \u2019 s very hard to walk away from a contest when you have millions of supporters who are clearly still determined to help you get elected . \u201d\nLike others in Clinton \u2019 s 2008 brain trust , Wolfson said he understands why Sanders wants to keep fighting . \u201c You begin to conclude this is a cause that \u2019 s bigger than yourself , \u201d he explained of the campaign \u2019 s mindset in the spring of 2008 . \u201c I \u2019 m sure there are the same sets of pressure on the Sanders camp today . \u201d\nBut for current Clinton officials in the trenches in Brooklyn , there has been growing frustration with the tone of Sanders \u2019 campaign and , in particular , his bullish campaign manager Jeff Weaver , who seems to double-down on the attacks with each setback .\nRather than make any overt calls for Sanders to get out , Clinton 's top campaign officials tried a subtler approach , stressing that after Tuesday night \u2019 s losses , it will be \u201c virtually impossible \u201d for Sanders to catch up . And her army of surrogates have been told not to call on Sanders to drop out , but to change his tone and drop the attacks .\nFor now , though , he 's still fighting even as Clinton appears to have wrapped up the nomination \u2014 but hinting at a new approach . On Tuesday night , Sanders put out a statement congratulating Clinton on her wins and hinting that he would stay in through the convention to promote his driving issues : a $ 15 minimum wage , ending \u201c disastrous \u201d trade policies , and breaking up the big banks , among other bullet points .\nThe Clintons themselves have a philosophy of fighting on , as Bill Clinton likes to say , \u201c until the last dog dies. \u201d And in 2008 , Hillary kept kicking through the final primaries on June 3 , where she won South Dakota and Barack Obama won Montana .

Back then , Bill Clinton was phoning superdelegates , reportedly trying to convince them that the country wasn \u2019 t ready to elect an African-American President . Hillary Clinton refused to make such calls , out of what allies say was a mixture of fear of rejection and sense of entitlement . This time , Sanders ' campaign is pointing to national polls where he still beats Clinton .\nBut just like eight years ago , Democrats said it is hard to see a scenario where superdelegates would go against the candidate leading in pledged delegates as well as the popular vote .\nSome Democrats said they wonder if in the same way Clinton \u2019 s campaign hoped for a bombshell that would undermine Obama \u2019 s nomination \u2014 the potential existence of an alleged tape ( which never materialized ) showing Michelle Obama using the word \u201c whitey \u201d animated the Clintons in the final months of the campaign \u2014 Sanders is holding out for an outside blow to Clinton .\nMused one Clinton ally : \u201c Is Sanders secretly banking on an FBI report ? \u201d\nLike Clinton in 2008 , Sanders also appears to be making a last-ditch racial argument tucked into a demographic one .
