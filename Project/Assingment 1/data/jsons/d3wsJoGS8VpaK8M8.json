But this particular toy is a doll , and it \u2019 s rare for parents to bring boys into these research groups to play with dolls . It \u2019 s rarer still for a boy to immediately attach himself to one the way Shi \u2019 a just did .\nAn 8-year-old who considers himself gender fluid and whose favorite color is black one week , pink the next , Shi \u2019 a sometimes plays with his younger sister \u2019 s dolls at home , but they \u2019 re \u201c girly , princess stuff , \u201d he says dismissively . This doll , with its prepubescent body and childish features , looks more like him , right down to the wave of bleached blond bangs . \u201c The hair is just like mine , \u201d Shi \u2019 a says , swinging his head in tandem with the doll \u2019 s . Then he turns to the playmate in the toy-testing room , a 7-year-old girl named Jhase , and asks , \u201c Should I put on the girl hair ? \u201d Shi \u2019 a fits a long , blond wig on the doll \u2019 s head , and suddenly it is no longer an avatar for him but for his sister .\nThe doll can be a boy , a girl , neither or both , and Mattel , which calls this the world \u2019 s first gender-neutral doll , is hoping its launch on Sept. 25 redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world \u2019 s kids . Carefully manicured features betray no obvious gender : the lips are not too full , the eyelashes not too long and fluttery , the jaw not too wide . There are no Barbie-like breasts or broad , Ken-like shoulders . Each doll in the Creatable World series looks like a slender 7-year-old with short hair , but each comes with a wig of long , lustrous locks and a wardrobe befitting any fashion-conscious kid : hoodies , sneakers , graphic T-shirts in soothing greens and yellows , along with tutus and camo pants .\nMattel \u2019 s first promotional spot for the $ 29.99 product features a series of kids who go by various pronouns\u2014him , her , them , xem\u2014and the slogan \u201c A doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in. \u201d With this overt nod to trans and nonbinary identities , the company is betting on where it thinks the country is going , even if it means alienating a substantial portion of the population . A Pew Research survey conducted in 2017 showed that while 76 % of the public supports parents \u2019 steering girls to toys and activities traditionally associated with boys , only 64 % endorse steering boys toward toys and activities associated with girls .\nFor years , millennial parents have pushed back against \u201c pink aisles \u201d and \u201c blue aisles \u201d in toy stores in favor of gender-neutral sections , often in the name of exposing girls to the building blocks and chemistry kits that foster interest in science and math but are usually categorized as boys \u2019 toys . Major toy sellers have listened , thanks to the millennial generation \u2019 s unrivaled size , trend-setting ability and buying power . Target eliminated gender-specific sections in 2015 . The same year , Disney banished \u201c boys \u201d and \u201c girls \u201d labels from its children \u2019 s costumes , inviting girls to dress as Captain America and boys as Belle . Last year , Mattel did away with \u201c boys \u201d and \u201c girls \u201d toy divisions in favor of nongendered sections : dolls or cars , for instance .\nBut the Creatable World doll is something else entirely . Unlike model airplanes or volcano kits , dolls have faces like ours , upon which we can project our own self-image and anxieties . Mattel tested the doll with 250 families across seven states , including 15 children who identify as trans , gender-nonbinary or gender-fluid and rarely see themselves reflected in the media , let alone their playthings . \u201c There were a couple of gender-creative kids who told us that they dreaded Christmas Day because they knew whatever they got under the Christmas tree , it wasn \u2019 t made for them , \u201d says Monica Dreger , head of consumer insights at Mattel . \u201c This is the first doll that you can find under the tree and see is for them because it can be for anyone . \u201d\nThe population of young people who identify as gender-nonbinary is growing . Though no large surveys have been done of kids younger than 10 , a recent study by the Williams Institute at the University of California , Los Angeles , found that 27 % of California teens identify as gender-nonconforming . And a 2018 Pew study found 35 % of Gen Z-ers ( born 1995 to 2015 ) say they personally know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns like they and them , compared with just 16 % of Gen X-ers ( born 1965 to 1980 ) . The patterns are projected to continue with Generation Alpha , born in 2010 and later . Those kids , along with boys who want to play with dolls and girls who identify as \u201c tomboys \u201d and don \u2019 t gravitate toward fashion doll play , are an untapped demographic . Mattel currently has 19 % market share in the $ 8 billion doll industry ; gaining just 1 more point could translate into $ 80 million in revenue for the company .\nMattel sees an even broader potential for Creatable World beyond gender-creative kids . In testing , the company found that Generation Alpha children chafed at labels and mandates no matter their gender identity : They didn \u2019 t want to be told whom a toy was designed for or how to play with it . They were delighted with a doll that had no name and could transform and adapt according to their whims .\nShi \u2019 a , left , and Jhase play with Mattel \u2019 s gender-neutral doll Photograph by Angie Smith for TIME .\nBut it \u2019 s parents who are making the purchasing decisions , and no adult is going to have a neutral reaction to this doll . In testing groups , several parents felt the \u201c gender-neutral \u201d branding of the toy pushed a political agenda , and some adults objected to the notion of their sons ever playing with dolls . Mattel \u2019 s President Richard Dickson insists the doll isn \u2019 t intended as a statement . \u201c We \u2019 re not in the business of politics , \u201d he says , \u201c and we respect the decision any parent makes around how they raise their kids . Our job is to stimulate imaginations . Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation , but it \u2019 s your conversation , not ours ; your opinion , not ours . \u201d\nYet even offering customers that blank canvas will be seen as political in a country where gender-neutral bathrooms still stir protests . Mattel joins a cohort of other companies that have chosen a side in a divisive political climate . Just in the past two years , Nike launched a campaign starring Colin Kaepernick after the NFL dropped him from the league for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism . Airbnb offered free housing to people displaced in the face of President Trump \u2019 s travel ban . Dick \u2019 s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons after the Parkland shooting . All these companies have reported eventual sales bumps after staking their claim in the culture wars .\nWhen pressed with these examples , Dickson admits that staying neutral is not an option if you want to be perceived as an innovator . \u201c I think being a company today , you have to have a combination of social justice along with commerce , and that balance can be tricky , \u201d Dickson says . \u201c Not everyone will appreciate you or agree with you . \u201d\nIn fact , dissent among boomers , Gen X-ers and even millennials may be a positive sign , according to Mattel \u2019 s own researchers . \u201c If all the parents who saw the dolls said , \u2018 This is what we \u2019 ve been waiting for , \u2019 we wouldn \u2019 t be doing our jobs , \u201d says Dreger . \u201c That would mean this should have already been in the market . So we \u2019 re maybe a little behind where kids are , ahead of where parents are , and that \u2019 s exactly where we need to be . \u201d\nWalking into Mattel \u2019 s headquarters , it \u2019 s difficult to imagine a gender-neutral world of play . A huge mural depicts some of the company \u2019 s most recognizable toys . A classic bouffanted version of Barbie in a black-and-white bathing suit and heels squints down at visitors . In another picture close by , a little boy puffs out his chest and rips open his shirt , Superman style , to reveal a red Mattel logo that reads \u201c Strength and Excellence. \u201d Even a toddler would be able to discern the messaging on how a woman and a man are expected to look from these images .\nBut the evolution within Mattel is obvious once visitors make their way past the entryway and into the designers \u2019 cubicles . Inspiration boards are covered with pictures of boys in skirts and girls in athletic gear . The most striking images are mashups of popular teen stars : the features of Camila Mendes and Cole Sprouse , who play Veronica and Jughead on Riverdale , combine to create one androgynous face , and Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard , who play the main characters on Stranger Things , blend into a single floppy-haired , genderless person with sharp cheekbones .\nIn the past decade , toy companies have begun to tear down gender barriers . Smaller businesses like GoldieBlox , which launched in 2012 and builds engineering toys targeting girls , and large companies like Lego , which created the female-focused Lego Friends line the same year , have made STEM toys for girls more mainstream . Small independent toymakers have pushed things further with dollhouses painted green and yellow instead of purple and pink , or cooking kits that are entirely white instead of decorated with flowers or butterflies .\nPerhaps it \u2019 s surprising , then , that nobody has beaten Mattel to creating a gender-neutral doll . A deep Google search for such a toy turns up baby dolls or strange-looking plush creatures that don \u2019 t resemble any human who ever walked this earth . Nothing comes close to the Creatable World doll that Mattel has conjured up over the past two years .\nScientists have debunked the idea that boys are simply born wanting to play with trucks and girls wanting to nurture dolls . A study by psychologists Lisa Dinella and Erica Weisgram , co-editors of Gender Typing of Children \u2019 s Toys : How Early Play Experiences Impact Development , found that when wheeled toys were painted white \u2014 and thus deprived of all color signaling whether they were \u201c boys \u2019 toys \u201d or \u201c girls \u2019 toys \u201d \u2014 girls and boys chose to play with the wheeled toys equally often . Dinella points out that removing gendered cues from toys facilitates play between boys and girls , crucial practice for when men and women must interact in the workplace and home as adults . She adds that millennials ( born 1981 to 1996 ) have pushed to share child-care responsibilities , and that battle ought to begin in the playroom . \u201c If boys , like girls , are encouraged to learn parental skills with doll play at a young age , you wind up with more nurturing and empathetic fathers , \u201d she says .\nAnd yet creating a doll to appeal to all kids , regardless of gender , remains risky . \u201c There are children who are willing to cross those gender boundaries that society places on toys , but there \u2019 s often a cost that comes with crossing those boundaries , \u201d Dinella says . \u201c That cost seems to be bigger for boys than it is for girls. \u201d Some of those social repercussions no doubt can be traced to parental attitudes . In Los Angeles , the majority of the seven parents in an early testing group for Creatable World complained the doll \u201c feels political , \u201d as one mom put it .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think my son should be playing with dolls , \u201d she continued . \u201c There \u2019 s a difference between a girl with a truck and a boy with a Barbie , and a boy with a Barbie is a no-no . \u201d\nThe only dad in the group shrugged . \u201c I don \u2019 t know , \u201d he said . \u201c My daughter is friends with a boy who wears dresses . I used to be against that type of thing , but now I \u2019 m O.K . with it . \u201d\nIn videos of those testing groups , many parents fumbled with the language to describe the dolls , confusing gender ( how a person identifies ) with sexuality ( whom a person is attracted to ) , mixing up gender-neutral ( without gender ) and trans ( a person who has transitioned from one gender to another ) and fretting about the mere idea of a boy playing with a doll . A second mom in Los Angeles asked before seeing the doll , \u201c Is it transgender ? How am I supposed to have a conversation with my kid about that ? \u201d After examining the toy and discussing gender-fluidity with the other parents , she declared , \u201c It \u2019 s just too much . Can \u2019 t we go back to 1970 ? \u201d\nAfter the session , Dreger analyzed the parental response . \u201c Adults get so tied up in the descriptions and definitions , \u201d she said . \u201c They jump to this idea of sexuality . They make themselves more anxious about it . For kids it \u2019 s much more intuitive . \u201d\nWhy , exactly , a new generation is rejecting categorizations that society has been using for millennia is up for debate . Eighty-one percent of Gen Z-ers believe that a person shouldn \u2019 t be defined by gender , according to a poll by the J. Walter Thompson marketing group . But it \u2019 s not just about gender \u2014 it \u2019 s about authenticity , whether real or perceived . Macho male actors and glam , ultra-feminine actresses have less cultural cachet than they used to . Gen Z , with its well-honed radar for anything overly polished or fake-seeming , prefers YouTube confessionals about battling everything from zits to depression . When the New York Times recently asked Generation Z to pick a name for itself , the most-liked response was \u201c Don \u2019 t call us anything . \u201d\nPerhaps their ideas of gender have expanded under the influence of parents who are beginning to reject practices like gender-reveal parties that box kids in even before they are born . Jenna Karvunidis , who popularized the gender-reveal party , recently revealed on Facebook that her now 10-year-old child is gender-nonconforming and that she regrets holding the party . \u201c She \u2019 s telling me , \u2018 Mom , there are many genders . Mom , there \u2019 s many different sexualities and all different types , \u2019 and I take her lead on that , \u201d Karvunidis said in an interview with NPR .\nPerhaps it \u2019 s that a generation of kids raised on video games where they could create their own avatars , with whatever styling and gender they please , has helped open up the way kids think about identity . Perhaps the simple fact that more celebrities like Amandla Stenberg and Sam Smith are coming out as gender-nonbinary has made it easier for other young people to do the same . Generation Alpha , the most diverse generation in America in all senses of the term , is likely to grow up with even more liberal views on gender .\n\u201c This is a rallying cry of this generation , \u201d says Jess Weiner , a cultural consultant for large companies looking to tap into modern-day markets and navigate issues of gender . \u201c Companies in this day and age have to evolve or else they die , they go away \u2026 And part of that evolving is trying to understand things they didn \u2019 t prior . \u201d\nMattel , which calls this the world \u2019 s first gender-neutral doll , is hoping its launch redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world \u2019 s kids . Photograph by JUCO for TIME\nMattel isn \u2019 t the first company to notice the trend of young shoppers moving away from gender-specific products . Rob Smith\u2014the founder of the Phluid Project , a gender-free clothing store that caters to the LGBTQ+ community in New York City\u2014says several large corporations , including Mattel , have approached him for advice on how to market to the young masses . \u201c I work with a lot of companies who are figuring out that the separation between male and female is less important to young consumers who don \u2019 t want to be boxed into anything , \u201d he says . \u201c There \u2019 s men \u2019 s shampoo and women \u2019 s shampoo , but it \u2019 s just all shampoo . Companies are starting to investigate that in-between space in order to win over Gen Z . \u201d\nStill , Mattel enters a politically charged debate at a precarious moment for corporations in America , where companies that want to gain customer loyalty are being pushed to one aisle or the other . A study from the PR agency Weber Shandwick found 47 % of millennials think CEOs should take stances on social issues . Some 51 % of millennials surveyed said they are more likely to buy products from companies run by activist CEOs . Now , if you walk into a Patagonia store , you \u2019 ll see a sign that reads , \u201c The President stole your land . Take action now . \u201d\nSuch activism is often born of self-interest : companies want to appeal to liberal customers and retain young employees and their allies . They face little risk by speaking up but major consequences by sitting on the sidelines . In August , customers boycotted Equinox and SoulCycle\u2014two companies that have aggressively courted the LGBTQ+ community\u2014when reports emerged that their key investor was holding a fundraiser for Trump with ticket prices as high as $ 250,000 . According to data analyses by Second Measure , in August , customer purchases were down almost 13 % compared to a month earlier .\nWeiner says SoulCycle \u2019 s experience should serve as a cautionary tale . \u201c I think businesses of any size now recognize that their consumer base values transparency over any other attribute . They want to know that your board is reflective of your choices , and that \u2019 s caught a lot of businesses off-guard , \u201d Weiner says . \u201c You can \u2019 t talk about gender equity in your commercial and then have no women on your board . They have to be savvy . \u201d\nNow , a toy company has chosen to make a product specifically to appeal to the progressive part of the country . Lisa McKnight , the senior vice president of the global doll portfolio at Mattel , says major retailers have been enthusiastic about Creatable World . \u201c They \u2019 re excited about the message of inclusivity , \u201d she says . \u201c The world is becoming a more diverse and inclusive place , and some people want to do more to support that. \u201d When pressed on the risks , she lays out the alternative . \u201c Candidly , we ask ourselves if another company were to launch a product line like this , how would we feel ? And after that gut check , we are proceeding . \u201d\nThe dolls faces betray no obvious gender : the lips are not too full , the eyelashes not too long and fluttery , the jaw not too wide . Here , the dolls faces are painted at Mattel 's headquarters on September 5 . Photograph by Angie Smith for TIME\nMattel will launch Creatable World exclusively online first , in part to better control the message . That includes giving sneak previews to select influencers and leaders in the LGBTQ+ community . Selling the doll in retail stores will be more complicated . For one thing , there \u2019 s the question of where to place it in stores to attract the attention of shoppers who might not venture into a doll section . Store clerks will have to be trained in what pronouns to use when talking about the doll and how to handle anxious parents \u2019 questions about it . And then there are practical concerns . Dickson admits the company is ready for the possibility that protests against Creatable World dolls could hurt other Mattel brands , namely Barbie .\nMattel has taken risks before . Most recently , in 2016 , it added three new body types to the Barbie doll : tall , petite and , most radically , curvy . It was the first time the company had made a major change to one of the most recognizable brands\u2014and bodies\u2014in the world in the doll \u2019 s almost-60-year history . The change helped propel Barbie from a retrograde doll lambasted by feminists for her impossible shape to a modern toy . She is now on the rise . Her sales have been up for the past eight quarters , and she saw a 14 % sales bump in the past year alone , according to Mattel .\nBut Mattel felt late to the game when it changed Barbie \u2019 s body : For years the Mindy Kalings and Ashley Grahams of the world had been championing fuller body types . Parents had been demanding change with boycotts and letter campaigns . By contrast , Creatable World feels like uncharted territory . Consider children \u2019 s media : Disney hasn \u2019 t introduced a major gay character in any of its movies , let alone a gender-nonconforming one . There are no trans superheroes on the big screen . Even characters whose creators say they are queer\u2014like Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series\u2014haven \u2019 t actually come out on the page or the screen . In that pop-culture space , a gender-neutral doll seems radical .\nEven though there is no scientific evidence to prove that this is the case , there will be customers who say that even exposing their children to a gender-nonbinary doll through commercials or in a play group would threaten to change their child \u2019 s identity . This debate will spin out into sociopolitical questions about whether the types of toys children play with affect their sense of identity and gender .\nThat conversation , if it comes , is worth it , according to Dickson . \u201c I think if we could have a hand in creating the idea that a boy can play with a perceived girl toy and a girl can play with a perceived boy toy , we would have contributed to a better , more sensitive place of perception in the world today , \u201d he says . \u201c And even more so for the kids that find themselves in that challenging place , if we can make that moment in their life a bit more comfortable , and knowing we created something that makes them feel recognized , that \u2019 s a beautiful thing . \u201d\nThe original version of this story misstated the SoulCycle metric tracked by Second Measure . It is customer purchases , not attendance .",

Mattel tested the doll with 250 families across seven states, including 15 children who identify as trans, gender-nonbinary or gender-fluid and rarely see themselves reflected in the media, let alone their playthings. \u201cThere were a couple of gender-creative kids who told us that they dreaded Christmas Day because they knew whatever they got under the Christmas tree, it wasn\u2019t made for them,\u201d says Monica Dreger, head of consumer insights at Mattel. \u201cThis is the first doll that you can find under the tree and see is for them because it can be for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe population of young people who identify as gender-nonbinary is growing.

Our job is to stimulate imaginations. Our toys are ultimately canvases for cultural conversation, but it\u2019s your conversation, not ours; your opinion, not ours.\u201d\n\nYet even offering customers that blank canvas will be seen as political in a country where gender-neutral bathrooms still stir protests. Mattel joins a cohort of other companies that have chosen a side in a divisive political climate. Just in the past two years, Nike launched a campaign starring Colin Kaepernick after the NFL dropped him from the league for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism. Airbnb offered free housing to people displaced in the face of President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons after the Parkland shooting. All these companies have reported eventual sales bumps after staking their claim in the culture wars.\n\nWhen pressed with these examples, Dickson admits that staying neutral is not an option if you want to be perceived as an innovator. \u201cI think being a company today, you have to have a combination of social justice along with commerce, and that balance can be tricky,\u201d Dickson says. \u201cNot everyone will appreciate you or agree with you.\u201d\n\nIn fact, dissent among boomers, Gen X-ers and even millennials may be a positive sign, according to Mattel\u2019s own researchers. \u201cIf all the parents who saw the dolls said, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u2019 we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs,\u201d says Dreger. \u201cThat would mean this should have already been in the market. So we\u2019re maybe a little behind where kids are, ahead of where parents are, and that\u2019s exactly where we need to be.\u201d\n\nWalking into Mattel\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a gender-neutral world of play.

In another picture close by, a little boy puffs out his chest and rips open his shirt, Superman style, to reveal a red Mattel logo that reads \u201cStrength and Excellence.\u201d Even a toddler would be able to discern the messaging on how a woman and a man are expected to look from these images.\n\nBut the evolution within Mattel is obvious once visitors make their way past the entryway and into the designers\u2019 cubicles. Inspiration boards are covered with pictures of boys in skirts and girls in athletic gear. The most striking images are mashups of popular teen stars: the features of Camila Mendes and Cole Sprouse, who play Veronica and Jughead on Riverdale, combine to create one androgynous face, and Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard, who play the main characters on Stranger Things, blend into a single floppy-haired, genderless person with sharp cheekbones.\n\nIn the past decade, toy companies have begun to tear down gender barriers. Smaller businesses like GoldieBlox, which launched in 2012 and builds engineering toys targeting girls, and large companies like Lego, which created the female-focused Lego Friends line the same year, have made STEM toys for girls more mainstream. Small independent toymakers have pushed things further with dollhouses painted green and yellow instead of purple and pink, or cooking kits that are entirely white instead of decorated with flowers or butterflies.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s surprising, then, that nobody has beaten Mattel to creating a gender-neutral doll. A deep Google search for such a toy turns up baby dolls or strange-looking plush creatures that don\u2019t resemble any human who ever walked this earth. Nothing comes close to the Creatable World doll that Mattel has conjured up over the past two years.\n\nScientists have debunked the idea that boys are simply born wanting to play with trucks and girls wanting to nurture dolls. A study by psychologists Lisa Dinella and Erica Weisgram, co-editors of Gender Typing of Children\u2019s Toys: How Early Play Experiences Impact Development, found that when wheeled toys were painted white \u2014 and thus deprived of all color signaling whether they were \u201cboys\u2019 toys\u201d or \u201cgirls\u2019 toys\u201d \u2014 girls and boys chose to play with the wheeled toys equally often. Dinella points out that removing gendered cues from toys facilitates play between boys and girls, crucial practice for when men and women must interact in the workplace and home as adults. She adds that millennials (born 1981 to 1996) have pushed to share child-care responsibilities, and that battle ought to begin in the playroom. \u201cIf boys, like girls, are encouraged to learn parental skills with doll play at a young age, you wind up with more nurturing and empathetic fathers,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd yet creating a doll to appeal to all kids, regardless of gender, remains risky. \u201cThere are children who are willing to cross those gender boundaries that society places on toys, but there\u2019s often a cost that comes with crossing those boundaries,\u201d Dinella says. \u201cThat cost seems to be bigger for boys than it is for girls.\u201d Some of those social repercussions no doubt can be traced to parental attitudes. In Los Angeles, the majority of the seven parents in an early testing group for Creatable World complained the doll \u201cfeels political,\u201d as one mom put it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my son should be playing with dolls,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a girl with a truck and a boy with a Barbie, and a boy with a Barbie is a no-no.\u201d\n\nThe only dad in the group shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter is friends with a boy who wears dresses. I used to be against that type of thing, but now I\u2019m O.K. with it.\u201d\n\nIn videos of those testing groups, many parents fumbled with the language to describe the dolls, confusing gender (how a person identifies) with sexuality (whom a person is attracted to), mixing up gender-neutral (without gender) and trans (a person who has transitioned from one gender to another) and fretting about the mere idea of a boy playing with a doll. A second mom in Los Angeles asked before seeing the doll, \u201cIs it transgender? How am I supposed to have a conversation with my kid about that?\u201d After examining the toy and discussing gender-fluidity with the other parents, she declared, \u201cIt\u2019s just too much. Can\u2019t we go back to 1970?\u201d\n\nAfter the session, Dreger analyzed the parental response. \u201cAdults get so tied up in the descriptions and definitions,\u201d she said. \u201cThey jump to this idea of sexuality. They make themselves more anxious about it. For kids it\u2019s much more intuitive.\u201d\n\nWhy, exactly, a new generation is rejecting categorizations that society has been using for millennia is up for debate. Eighty-one percent of Gen Z-ers believe that a person shouldn\u2019t be defined by gender, according to a poll by the J. Walter Thompson marketing group. But it\u2019s not just about gender \u2014 it\u2019s about authenticity, whether real or perceived. Macho male actors and glam, ultra-feminine actresses have less cultural cachet than they used to. Gen Z, with its well-honed radar for anything overly polished or fake-seeming, prefers YouTube confessionals about battling everything from zits to depression. When the New York Times recently asked Generation Z to pick a name for itself, the most-liked response was \u201cDon\u2019t call us anything.\u201d\n\nPerhaps their ideas of gender have expanded under the influence of parents who are beginning to reject practices like gender-reveal parties that box kids in even before they are born. Jenna Karvunidis, who popularized the gender-reveal party, recently revealed on Facebook that her now 10-year-old child is gender-nonconforming and that she regrets holding the party. \u201cShe\u2019s telling me, \u2018Mom, there are many genders. Mom, there\u2019s many different sexualities and all different types,\u2019 and I take her lead on that,\u201d Karvunidis said in an interview with NPR.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s that a generation of kids raised on video games where they could create their own avatars, with whatever styling and gender they please, has helped open up the way kids think about identity. Perhaps the simple fact that more celebrities like Amandla Stenberg and Sam Smith are coming out as gender-nonbinary has made it easier for other young people to do the same. Generation Alpha, the most diverse generation in America in all senses of the term, is likely to grow up with even more liberal views on gender.\n\n\u201cThis is a rallying cry of this generation,\u201d says Jess Weiner, a cultural consultant for large companies looking to tap into modern-day markets and navigate issues of gender. \u201cCompanies in this day and age have to evolve or else they die, they go away \u2026 And part of that evolving is trying to understand things they didn\u2019t prior.\u201d\n\nMattel, which calls this the world\u2019s first gender-neutral doll, is hoping its launch redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world\u2019s kids. Photograph by JUCO for TIME\n\nMattel isn\u2019t the first company to notice the trend of young shoppers moving away from gender-specific products. Rob Smith\u2014the founder of the Phluid Project, a gender-free clothing store that caters to the LGBTQ+ community in New York City\u2014says several large corporations, including Mattel, have approached him for advice on how to market to the young masses. \u201cI work with a lot of companies who are figuring out that the separation between male and female is less important to young consumers who don\u2019t want to be boxed into anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s men\u2019s shampoo and women\u2019s shampoo, but it\u2019s just all shampoo. Companies are starting to investigate that in-between space in order to win over Gen Z.\u201d\n\nStill, Mattel enters a politically charged debate at a precarious moment for corporations in America, where companies that want to gain customer loyalty are being pushed to one aisle or the other. A study from the PR agency Weber Shandwick found 47% of millennials think CEOs should take stances on social issues. Some 51% of millennials surveyed said they are more likely to buy products from companies run by activist CEOs. Now, if you walk into a Patagonia store, you\u2019ll see a sign that reads, \u201cThe President stole your land. Take action now.\u201d\n\nSuch activism is often born of self-interest: companies want to appeal to liberal customers and retain young employees and their allies. They face little risk by speaking up but major consequences by sitting on the sidelines. In August, customers boycotted Equinox and SoulCycle\u2014two companies that have aggressively courted the LGBTQ+ community\u2014when reports emerged that their key investor was holding a fundraiser for Trump with ticket prices as high as $250,000. According to data analyses by Second Measure, in August, customer purchases were down almost 13% compared to a month earlier.\n\nWeiner says SoulCycle\u2019s experience should serve as a cautionary tale. \u201cI think businesses of any size now recognize that their consumer base values transparency over any other attribute. They want to know that your board is reflective of your choices, and that\u2019s caught a lot of businesses off-guard,\u201d Weiner says. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about gender equity in your commercial and then have no women on your board. They have to be savvy.\u201d\n\nNow, a toy company has chosen to make a product specifically to appeal to the progressive part of the country. Lisa McKnight, the senior vice president of the global doll portfolio at Mattel, says major retailers have been enthusiastic about Creatable World. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about the message of inclusivity,\u201d she says. \u201cThe world is becoming a more diverse and inclusive place, and some people want to do more to support that.\u201d When pressed on the risks, she lays out the alternative. \u201cCandidly, we ask ourselves if another company were to launch a product line like this, how would we feel? And after that gut check, we are proceeding.\u201d\n\nThe dolls faces betray no obvious gender: the lips are not too full, the eyelashes not too long and fluttery, the jaw not too wide. Here, the dolls faces are painted at Mattel's headquarters on September 5. Photograph by Angie Smith for TIME\n\nMattel will launch Creatable World exclusively online first, in part to better control the message. That includes giving sneak previews to select influencers and leaders in the LGBTQ+ community. Selling the doll in retail stores will be more complicated. For one thing, there\u2019s the question of where to place it in stores to attract the attention of shoppers who might not venture into a doll section. Store clerks will have to be trained in what pronouns to use when talking about the doll and how to handle anxious parents\u2019 questions about it. And then there are practical concerns. Dickson admits the company is ready for the possibility that protests against Creatable World dolls could hurt other Mattel brands, namely Barbie.\n\nMattel has taken risks before. Most recently, in 2016, it added three new body types to the Barbie doll: tall, petite and, most radically, curvy. It was the first time the company had made a major change to one of the most recognizable brands\u2014and bodies\u2014in the world in the doll\u2019s almost-60-year history. The change helped propel Barbie from a retrograde doll lambasted by feminists for her impossible shape to a modern toy. She is now on the rise. Her sales have been up for the past eight quarters, and she saw a 14% sales bump in the past year alone, according to Mattel.\n\nBut Mattel felt late to the game when it changed Barbie\u2019s body: For years the Mindy Kalings and Ashley Grahams of the world had been championing fuller body types. Parents had been demanding change with boycotts and letter campaigns. By contrast, Creatable World feels like uncharted territory. Consider children\u2019s media: Disney hasn\u2019t introduced a major gay character in any of its movies, let alone a gender-nonconforming one. There are no trans superheroes on the big screen. Even characters whose creators say they are queer\u2014like Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series\u2014haven\u2019t actually come out on the page or the screen. In that pop-culture space, a gender-neutral doll seems radical.\n\nEven though there is no scientific evidence to prove that this is the case, there will be customers who say that even exposing their children to a gender-nonbinary doll through commercials or in a play group would threaten to change their child\u2019s identity. This debate will spin out into sociopolitical questions about whether the types of toys children play with affect their sense of identity and gender.\n\nThat conversation, if it comes, is worth it, according to Dickson. \u201cI think if we could have a hand in creating the idea that a boy can play with a perceived girl toy and a girl can play with a perceived boy toy, we would have contributed to a better, more sensitive place of perception in the world today,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd even more so for the kids that find themselves in that challenging place, if we can make that moment in their life a bit more comfortable, and knowing we created something that makes them feel recognized, that\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Oct. 2\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the SoulCycle metric tracked by Second Measure.
