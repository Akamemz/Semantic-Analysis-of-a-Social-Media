    "content": "Yesterday , Facebook \u2019 s stock tanked after it was revealed that they gave user data to a firm , Global Science Research ( GSR ) , via an app . This data was then given to Cambridge Analytica , a firm that was working for Donald J. Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign . The app not only gave GSR the data of the user who filled out the survey , but also that of all of the user \u2019 s friends without them knowing it . Some have noted a similar mining tool used by the Obama team , but they gathered information through their website ( with permission from those who engaged ) and the armies of volunteers , which was then matched with voter profiles . At the same time , these users also gave permission to have their friends data siphoned ; their friends gave no such consent . Yes , still a bit creepy , especially since the campaign boasted that they probably knew every single one of the 67+ million voters who supported President Obama in 2012 .\nLast night , footage was released of Cambridge Analytica \u2019 s top executives pitching dirty political tricks , like video of a candidate accepting a bribe , girls around the candidate \u2019 s house , and even good ole \u2019 misinformation . The firm has denied ever using any of the tactics discussed and this isn \u2019 t necessarily earth-shattering news in the skulky world of nail biter campaigns , but it adds to the bad optics that both Facebook and Cambridge have reaped since Christopher Wylie , the brainchild of the firm , came forward to spill the inner workings of this company . Facebook certainly knew that something was up concerning user data given the sheer volume GSR was mining from the app MyPersonality . But we \u2019 re not going to discuss Cambridge . We \u2019 re discussing what many of you have noted on various social media platforms about the inherent left wing bias ingrained in the services . Well , one former data officer for the Obama campaign , Carol Davidsen , admitted that Facebook allowed them to break the rules because they were on their side .\nFirst , she tweeted a Time magazine piece showing what the 2012 campaign did to gather information :\nIn the final weeks before Election Day , a scary statistic emerged from the databases at Barack Obama \u2019 s Chicago headquarters : half the campaign \u2019 s targeted swing-state voters under age 29 had no listed phone number . They lived in the cellular shadows , effectively immune to traditional get-out-the-vote efforts . For a campaign dependent on a big youth turnout , this could have been a crisis . But the Obama team had a solution in place : a Facebook application that will transform the way campaigns are conducted in the future . For supporters , the app appeared to be just another way to digitally connect to the campaign .
