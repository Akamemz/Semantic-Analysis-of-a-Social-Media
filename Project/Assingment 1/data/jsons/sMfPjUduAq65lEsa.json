As more time passes , and Ms. Anderson mends from her emotional wounds , she finds herself aware of other subtle shifts in her mindset and approach to life .\nShe makes an effort to slow down in the evenings after work to savor the quiet hours with her husband . The already close bond she shared with the couple \u2019 s two college-age children has deepened .

Their Frank Lloyd Wright style home was burned in the Tubbs Fire .\nThe Tubbs fire ranks as the second-most destructive blaze in state history , behind the wildfire that wiped out much of Paradise . The sluggish pace of new housing construction in Santa Rosa has begun to pick up in the past six months . The emotional recovery of residents remains more difficult to gauge .\nThe demand for mental health services offers one measure of the trauma caused by the fires two years ago .

Those who opt to stay must weigh the risks of living in an area twice ravaged by fire since 1964 and in a state where the size , number , and intensity of wildfires appears on the rise .\nThe choices can sharpen the despair of residents as they languish between an irretrievable past and an unsettled present . \u201c It \u2019 s not just a house and the stuff we lose , \u201d Ms. Wheelwright says . \u201c It \u2019 s also losing the feeling of security and the routines we have as part of our daily lives . \u201d\nThe Tubbs fire reduced to ashes the Santa Rosa home where Georgina and John Logue had lived since 1984 .

The theory \u2019 s broad principles range from greater self-confidence , appreciation for life , and compassion for others to closer personal relationships and deeper spiritual beliefs .\nA crucial aspect of that internal change involves the degree of hardship survivors confront as they seek to reclaim their lives . One study found that New York residents who reported severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after Hurricane Sandy showed more capacity to grow from their experience . Several studies of Hurricane Katrina survivors yielded similar results .\nBehavioral health researchers emphasize that post-traumatic growth generally occurs only after people resurface from a wrenching crisis and make peace with their fate . \u201c It \u2019 s hard for good things to happen when we \u2019 re still feeling damaged , \u201d Dr. North says . \u201c The positive change comes with time and perspective . \u201d\nMs. Logue sought solace from her faith and family , including five grandchildren .
