He ran in the 1988 campaign , but dropped out after it was discovered that portions of his speech were similar to those given by UK Labour Leader Neil Kinnock . In 2007 , he managed to clinch a whopping 1 percent in the Iowa Caucuses , but he \u2019 s now the Vice President of the United States ; a role he reportedly revels in at the Obama White House .\nRegardless , Politico reported back in October that there are some on his staff who are convinced he would run after 2012\u2013and there are some who think otherwise . As for presidential ambitions regarding his various trips across the country , it \u2019 s very hard to read the tea leaves there as well :\nHe \u2019 s made appearances in Florida , South Carolina and New Hampshire , but they \u2019 ve been brief . Three days after Clinton headlined Sen. Tom Harkin \u2019 s annual steak fry last month , Biden jumped on a plane to Des Moines to join a dozen sisters kicking off their \u201c Nuns on the Bus \u201d cross-country voter registration and social-justice tour . His office said the trip was an official event , nothing to do with politics or Clinton \u2019 s visit . In Washington and in Iowa both , he came across as not wanting to leave Clinton unanswered in Iowa . He \u2019 s worked with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic National Committee to coordinate some of his travel . Sometimes , people don \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s up to at all . When Biden arrived two weeks ago in Columbia , South Carolina , for a get-out-the-vote rally and state Democratic Party fundraiser \u2014 catching up with an old commitment to the DNC to do some voting rights events in the South \u2014 a number of key Washington operatives learned about the stop from news reports once he was already there . Or Biden stops come together like this : Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley is friends with his son Beau from their work together as AGs , so her campaign calls Biden \u2019 s office directly to work out the campaign schedule that generated a fundraiser at the Banshee Pub in Cambridge . Or he \u2019 s in Los Angeles with one candidate for a House seat and another for California secretary of state , and jumps up to Portland for a walk through town with Sen.

He toyed with the idea of a leadership PAC , but that never came together in large part due to concerns it would play too much into the prospective presidential narrative . \u2026 Biden tells a story he \u2019 s told before , a lesson he says he learned in his earliest days in the Senate , when candidates kept asking him his secret to winning .

He \u2019 s the vice president , a former U.S . Senator , and oodles of experience in public life .
