During the campaign , The Washington Post published a video in which Trump boasted about sexually assaulting women , and about a dozen women came forward with allegations of sexual assault and harassment stretching across decades . He was a historically dishonest candidate , lying publicly on matters large and small , important and not , easily debunked and not . He would not commit to accepting the results of the election if he lost .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign borrowed its tactics from Europe \u2019 s right-wing populist parties , eagerly leveraging race for political gain . He blamed immigration , whether from Latin America or from the Middle East , for many of the country \u2019 s ills , openly demonizing Hispanics and Muslims and railing against \u201c political correctness. \u201d He drew support from a resurgent white supremacist movement , passing along messages from anti-Semites and those who argue that a \u201c white genocide \u201d is occurring . He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and wavered before rejecting the support of former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke . These choices , along with his comments about women , produced a lopsided demographic result , with African Americans , Hispanics , and women backing Clinton by wide margins and white voters carrying Trump to the win .\nTrump broke nearly every rule of political campaigning on the way to his win . He survived an unprecedented abandonment by members of his own party ; even GOP officials who endorsed Trump often did so through gritted teeth . He lost the endorsements of even the most staunchly Republican newspapers . He barely engaged in fundraising for his race , beginning to ask for money only late in the game . Ultimately , Trump raised scarcely half of what Clinton did , and he hardly purchased ads to combat her onslaught of television spots , relying instead on social media and his own Twitter account . He eschewed traditional campaigning , from the construction of a field organization to the use of polling to the deployment of a carefully calibrated data analytics team , a tool that Obama \u2019 s two wins had established as a must .
