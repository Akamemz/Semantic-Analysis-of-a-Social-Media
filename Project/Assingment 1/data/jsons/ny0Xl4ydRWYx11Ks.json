Bush \u2019 s first EPA administrator , disputes Pruitt \u2019 s decision to focus on a limited set of EPA programs , such as the toxic-waste cleanups it carries out under the 1980 Superfund law .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it has to be an either-or , nor should it be , \u201d Whitman said , adding : \u201c Superfund is not the only issue for human health . Water pollution is a huge issue and very important and you need to work on it , but it \u2019 s not the only issue . Air is an issue , too . Even if you don \u2019 t want to believe in climate change , you 've got to believe that carbon and mercury are not good for you . \u201d\nEPA did not make Pruitt available for an interview , but he told Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel that his aim is for EPA to achieve \u201c tangible \u201d results through \u201c a restoration of its priorities , \u201d such as cleaning up the nation \u2019 s 1,300 Superfund sites .\n\u201c These are issues that go directly to the health of our citizens that should be the absolute focus of this agency , \u201d Pruitt told Strassel , who was the first to praise him as an \u201c EPA originalist. \u201d Pruitt added : \u201c This president is a fixer , he \u2019 s an action-oriented leader , and a refocused EPA is in a great position to get results . \u201d\nPruitt has also defended Trump \u2019 s proposal for a 31 percent budget cut at his agency in fiscal year 2018 , which would force it to shed about a fifth of its workforce \u2014 saying EPA \u2019 s core functions would survive . `` I believe we can fulfill the mission of our agency with a trimmed budget , with proper leadership and management , '' he said at an appropriations hearing that had him fielding complaints from Republicans and Democrats alike .\nOn the other hand , Trump \u2019 s proposal would slash many of the same toxic-waste and clean-water programs that Pruitt has put at the center of the agency 's mission .\nThe tension highlights disputes over EPA \u2019 s role as environmental threats have evolved , as well as the Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to achieve lasting reductions in the government \u2019 s regulatory powers .\nSo far , Pruitt has launched rollbacks of Obama \u2019 s greenhouse gas rules for power plants , delayed deadlines for polluters and slowed agency work on new regulations , and most recently helped persuade Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal .\nPruitt has also placed a greater emphasis on considering economic concerns in the agency 's decisions . He has cited that reasoning when he has roll ed back regulations on climate change , air pollution and clean water , even in cases where the Supreme Court has said costs can not factor into a regulation .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to improve the environment in this country , protect our water , protect our air , but at the same time do it the American way , \u201d Pruitt said in an April speech at a coal mine in Sycamore , P ennsylvania . \u201c Grow jobs and show the rest of the world that we can achieve it . \u201d\nBut the powers of the EPA administrator are limited : While he or she can have huge influence over the agency \u2019 s direction , Congress has laid out its scope and responsibilities in laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act .\nThat means Pruitt can not act like a `` tinhorn dictator '' by deciding which laws to avoid `` in favor of economic development , '' said Thomas Jorling , a former Senate Republican staffer who co-authored the Clean Air Act in 1970 and the Clean Water Act in 1972 . Jorling , who filed a court brief last year defending the Obama EPA 's landmark climate regulation , accused Pruitt of being \u201c disingenuous '' by focusing the agency on a limited set of priorities .\n\u201c It \u2019 s all basically a smokescreen to their real intention , which is kind of a moral and ethical corruption , to \u2026 restore the dependence of the United States energy system on fossil fuels , \u201d Jorling said .\nPruitt maintains that the agency \u2019 s Obama-era leaders vastly overstepped EPA \u2019 s authority by issuing regulations such as its greenhouse gas limits for power plants . Pruitt previously made that argument while waging legal fights against the EPA when he was Oklahoma attorney general .\nPruitt said last month that he has not yet decided whether to craft new climate rules after repealing the Obama versions .\nBut his Republicans critics say it \u2019 s wrong to reject climate change as an EPA priority , even if there \u2019 s room for debate on the scope of Obama \u2019 s actions . The Supreme Court has ruled that EPA must regulate greenhouse gases if they threaten human health and welfare , which the agency has concluded they do .\nStates say Superfund sites are big issues in their communities , said Thomas , the former Reagan administration EPA leader , but the risks of climate change are `` significantly higher . ''\n`` There \u2019 s a lot more uncertainty around [ global warming ] , but that doesn \u2019 t mean you don \u2019 t deal with it , '' he said .\nMeanwhile , the rollbacks under Pruitt go well beyond climate change . Pruitt has ordered a rewrite of the Obama-era Waters of the U.S. rule , a sweeping regulation that sought to define which waterways and wetlands fall under the federal government \u2019 s purview . And he remains critical of the Obama administration \u2019 s efforts to tighten smog standards when much of the country has yet to meet previous limits \u2014 even though the Clean Air Act says EPA is supposed to base those decisions solely on the latest health science .\nIn addition , Pruitt has said his philosophy will involve fewer instances of the federal government overriding state cleanup plans it deems insufficient . And he says EPA will use fewer consent decrees \u2014 settlements negotiated with companies that have violated regulations \u2014 a practice Republicans have long criticized as \u201c regulation by litigation . \u201d\nInstead , Pruitt aims to focus on the Superfund program , cleanups of polluted \u201c brownfields , \u201d and drinking water infrastructure , all of which involve economic development . He has also placed an emphasis on implementing last year \u2019 s bipartisan chemical safety reforms , especially the process that approves new chemicals for use in products .\nMyron Ebell , a longtime critic of climate change science and the Trump administration \u2019 s former transition leader for EPA , supports Pruitt \u2019 s originalism mission because it dials back the agency \u2019 s reach .\n\u201c It seems to me EPA has fairly clear statutory responsibilities under a number of statutes , and those statutory responsibilities should come first , \u201d said Ebell , director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute 's Center for Energy and the Environment .\n\u201c But over time and particularly in the Obama administration , they have taken on a whole lot of things which are entirely discretionary , that they don \u2019 t have to do , they \u2019 re not required by law to do it , but they decided to do it anyway , \u201d Ebell added .\nBut Jorling , the former Republican staffer , said people like Ebell have their history wrong .\nJorling said he and Leon Billings , his late Democratic counterpart in writing the landmark air and water laws that Pruitt is now entrusted to enforce , believed that the statutes they wrote were not static . Instead , they were designed to adapt to new situations .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a complete misreading of those statutes and it really denigrates the senators and members of Congress that I worked for and with at the time , \u201d he said of the arguments Pruitt and his supporters make . \u201c They were very concerned that you don \u2019 t just write a statute for the past . You write a statute for the future . \u201d\nGeorgetown environmental law professor William Buzbee agreed that the laws \u2019 legislative history shows they were `` not written to be frozen in time , but to give EPA important protective roles that will evolve in light of improved science and understanding of emerging risks .
