    "content": "( CNN ) Long before Donald Trump declared his presidential candidacy , conservative strategist Steve Bannon sought to leverage data-driven technology to push the hearts and minds of voters toward his populist vision for America .\nFormer Cambridge Analytica staffers tell CNN that Bannon 's vision came to fruition through their previous employer , which they described as a weapon of psychological warfare . They say that Cambridge Analytica 's parent company had worked on government and military contracts that aimed to change foreign populations ' behaviors , which aligned with Bannon 's intentions .\nTwo former employees said that Bannon was personally involved in the company 's early stages and that he played a direct role shaping its strategy and goals .\n`` This was Steve Bannon 's baby , '' said former contractor Christopher Wylie , who described Cambridge Analytica as `` Bannon 's arsenal of weaponry to wage a culture war on America using military strategies . ''\nBannon wanted to use the sorts of aggressive messaging tactics usually reserved for geopolitical conflicts to move the US electorate further to the right , Wylie said . He had already directed a series of anti-establishment , conservative documentary films and presided over the far-right website Breitbart News , but Cambridge Analytica would mark another step in his overall ambitions to transform the nation .\nWith financial backing from hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer , Bannon co-founded Cambridge Analytica in 2013 as the US-branch of Strategic Communication Laboratories ( SCL ) Group , a British company that advertises how it has conducted `` behavioral change '' programs in more than 60 countries .\nWylie described Cambridge Analytica as `` Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer using a foreign , military contractor ... to use some of the same techniques that the military uses ... on the American electorate . ''\nBannon and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment to this story .\nSCL Group has consulted numerous government agencies and organizations on psychological operations and strategic messaging since the 1990s . The company has offered clients `` research and analysis that yields intervention strategies aimed at specific behaviors , '' according to its website\nThat work has included an examination of ways to reduce recruitment into violent jihadist groups in Pakistan in 2009 , a communication program aimed at decreasing the number of improvised explosive devices built in Iraq , as well as political consulting throughout sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia and South America , according to SCL documents .\nSCL was commissioned to train a psychological operations group that supported the British military , according to a 2012 letter by the group 's then-commanding officer .\nThe US State Department also contracted SCL in 2017 to conduct `` target audience research '' in order to better understand ISIS radicalization and recruitment . A State Department official told CNN the research included about 100 interviews in Europe and the Middle East .\n`` SCL 's sales pitch essentially was 'Look , we go into foreign countries . We use our tools , our psychographic profiling , to manipulate public opinion .
