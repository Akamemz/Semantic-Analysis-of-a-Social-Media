    "content": "THE episode that encapsulated the Republican establishment \u2019 s capitulation to Donald Trump had been planned as a repudiation of him . It was when Senator Marco Rubio , in a bid to salvage his sinking candidacy in the 2016 Republican primaries , suggested that Mr Trump had a small penis . Formerly known as a high-minded conservative , Mr Rubio also mocked the Republican front-runner \u2019 s hair and \u201c orange \u201d skin . \u201c Donald Trump likes to sue people , \u201d he told a crowd in Virginia , ahead of the round of primaries that more or less sealed Mr Trump \u2019 s capture of the Republican nomination . \u201c He should sue whoever did that to his face . \u201d\nTwo years on , Mr Rubio is plotting a more elevated response to the earthquake Mr Trump has triggered on the right . In an hour-long interview he describes his plan for a new \u201c reform conservative movement \u201d devoted to addressing the economic disruption and social disaffection that the president vigorously described . In offering himself as an optimistic Reaganite , Mr Rubio acknowledges that he missed the \u201c anxiety and anger \u201d Mr Trump tapped into . \u201c I spent a tremendous amount of time focused on the opportunities I had as the son of a bartender and a maid in the past century , \u201d he says . \u201c I didn \u2019 t spend nearly enough time talking about what the bartender and the maid face today . \u201d\nThe details of Mr Rubio \u2019 s new programme are unclear , but he suggests they will involve more interventions such as the increased child tax credit he inserted into the tax reform passed last year , and a provision for paid family leave he is working on now . He mulls the need for more public spending on technological research and for education reform , to prioritise vocational skills . He advocates a more flexible benefit system , to help the retraining of disrupted workers . Against the magnitude of America \u2019 s income inequality , such measures might seem modest . Yet from the lips of an orthodox Republican leader , they imply a serious reconsideration of the pre-eminent conservative ideals : a minimal government role in the economy and a related view of liberty as \u201c freedom from \u201d government interference . \u201c Government has an essential role to play in buffering this transition , \u201d he says . \u201c If we basically say everyone is on their own and the market \u2019 s going to take care of it , we will rip the country apart , because millions of good hardworking people lack the means to adapt. \u201d Economic liberty , in this retelling , becomes something the government is required to guarantee . It is the freedom to enjoy \u201c the dignity of work \u201d , says Mr Rubio . \u201c There needs to be a conservative movement that addresses these realities . \u201d\nHis implication that Republicans have found no good answer to the problems Mr Trump described is irrefutable . The president \u2019 s scheme to revive the 1970s economy through protectionism and deregulation is unrealistic , as Mr Rubio\u2014who these days dares not criticise Mr Trump\u2014 can not help but acknowledge . \u201c The future is going to happen , \u201d he says . \u201c I have no problem with bringing back American car-manufacturing facilities , but , whether they \u2019 re American robots or Mexican robots , they \u2019 re going to be highly automated. \u201d Most Republican congressmen meanwhile remain entranced by the limited-government shibboleths he has shaken off , as his fight over the tax bill revealed . Mr Rubio \u2019 s proposal , to double the tax credit to $ 2,000 per child and pay for it by making a small increase to the corporate rate his party wanted , was decried by some Republicans as socialism . The watered-down version they accepted , as the price of Mr Rubio \u2019 s support for the bill , excluded the poorest families . \u201c There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy , they \u2019 re going to take the money they \u2019 re saving and reinvest it in American workers , \u201d he says . \u201c In fact they bought back shares , a few gave out bonuses ; there \u2019 s no evidence whatsoever that the money \u2019 s been massively poured back into the American worker . \u201d\nThat shows how resistant Mr Rubio \u2019 s party will be to the changes he wants . \u201c I \u2019 m a minority within a minority , \u201d he says .
