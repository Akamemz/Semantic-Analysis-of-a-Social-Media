On the other was the possibility that Trump did n't have an improper relationship with the Kremlin and was acting within the bounds of his executive authority , the transcripts show .\nJames Baker , then-FBI general counsel , said the FBI officials were contemplating with regard to Russia whether Trump was `` acting at the behest of and somehow following directions , somehow executing their will . ''\n`` That was one extreme . The other extreme is that the President is completely innocent , and we discussed that too , '' Baker told House investigators last year . `` There 's a range of things this could possibly be .
