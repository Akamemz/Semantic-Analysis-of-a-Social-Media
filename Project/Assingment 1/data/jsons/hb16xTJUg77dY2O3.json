    "content": "There 's a sense of growing optimism among Democrats that if Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket they might have a chance at what otherwise seems impossible : curtailing the GOP 's stranglehold on the US House of Representatives .\nThe fundamental landscape is deeply unfavorable to House Democrats . They 're down 30 seats and behind in fundraising with district boundaries drawn in such a way that winning a national majority of votes wo n't deliver them a majority of seats . They need , fundamentally , something game-changing and weird to happen . And then , like magic , along comes Donald Trump , who happens to be weak in exactly the sort of Republican-leaning suburban districts they are hoping to peel away from the GOP .\n`` [ Trump ] makes districts that would have been hard-core tossup districts '' into ones that lean Democratic , and gives Democrats `` a little bit of a push '' in Republican-leaning districts across the country , according to Kelly Ward , the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .\nIn a practical sense , the DCCC 's pre-Trump vision was heavily focused on the long-term planning of what they call The Majority Project , a multi-cycle effort to simultaneously improve the DCCC 's field and data infrastructure while understanding which districts are being made newly competitive by ongoing demographic change .\n`` Data shows us that Democrats are moving into Republican districts and making them more Democratic over time , as we look between now and 2020 , '' DCCC chair Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n ( D-NM ) told me just before Trump 's Super Tuesday sweep . Post-sweep , Ward says , the Trump takeover `` accelerates this for us . ''\nFor a sense of exactly how lost and forlorn House Democrats were before Trump breathed new life into their hopes , it 's useful to look beyond the DCCC to the behavior of Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen . Himself a former DCCC chair , he was widely regarded as a likely successor to Nancy Pelosi as the Democrats ' leader in the House , since the top two Dems behind her in the party hierarchy , Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn , are both quite old themselves .\nBut rather than hold on to a safe House seat and hope to sweep into the speakership , he chose to resign his seat in order to fight a tough contested primary for the Democratic nomination for an open Senate seat in Maryland \u2014 a clear indication that he saw no short-term path to significant gains in the House .\nAnd he 's not alone . House Democrats face two serious headwinds in their quest for a majority that they are essentially powerless to cure .\nThe first is that the map is simply very unfavorable to them . Back in 2012 , Barack Obama won considerably more votes than Mitt Romney , but Romney actually carried more House districts . This is because Democrats , through a mix of partisan gerrymandering and natural geography , are more likely to be packed into lopsided districts . To win the House , they need a landslide , not just a win .\nThe second is that House landslides , when they happen , almost always hurt the incumbent president 's party .\nThe basic dilemma for a House minority whose party controls the presidency is that either people are generally happy with the status quo , in which case the president is likely to be popular but voters are unlikely to vote out tons of House incumbents , or else people are unhappy with the status quo , in which case the voters are likely to punish both the president and his co-partisans in the House .\nDemocrats ' only real hope for 2016 is for something off-the-charts weird to happen in presidential politics .

It is also possible that unpredictable events \u2014 terrorist attacks , foreign wars , financial crises \u2014 will impinge on the election in ways that badly damage Clinton 's hope . In either of those cases , House Democrats will be dragged down too .\nBut based on what we know of Trump so far , he seems likely to be a weak general election nominee who is weak specifically in areas that House Democrats see as growth possibilities .\nDemocrats ' top targets are a series of suburban districts where Republican incumbents have retired , somewhat fatigued with the incessant inter-caucus warfare among House Republicans . These kind of districts \u2014 places like PA-8 , MN-2 , NV-3 , NY-19 \u2014 are places whose Republican voters are disproportionately well-educated and supporting non-Trump candidates .
