Ninety-two Nobel laureates have walked the same stone stairways and underground tunnels she scurries through between classrooms and libraries .\nJust as exciting to someone who used to have to drive for miles to get to Walmart , she can hop on her used olive-green bicycle and zip to class or a variety of stores in the Hyde Park community in a few minutes .\nBut the bike isn \u2019 t the only thing accelerating her . Attending UChicago is pushing her quickly up the social mobility ladder .\nAt one point , she thought all she could afford was to enroll in a state public university , where she could apply two years \u2019 worth of credit she earned at community college during her high school years .\nHer Mexican-immigrant parents didn \u2019 t attend college . And her only recent role model who left Swainsboro for an elite university was a family friend from church who went to Yale . But she felt encouraged by her small town \u2013 even the woman on the other side of the window where she went to pay her phone bill last summer asked about her plans .\nEyeing a major in political science and/or sociology , she says she \u2019 s grateful \u201c to meet a lot more interesting people who all worked hard throughout their four years to get to someplace like this . \u201d\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201c I thought that if I hid my test scores from the school , they would ask , what are you hiding ? But it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn \u2019 t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn \u2019 t really , in my opinion , define who I was as a person. \u201d \u2013 Esmeralda Hernandez , a student at the University of Chicago who didn \u2019 t submit her SAT scores in her admissions application\nShe \u2019 s sitting at a dark wooden table in Hutchinson Commons , an Oxford-inspired dining hall and student lounge , where the global mix of students contrasts with stately rows of UChicago presidential portraits lining the walls . But even indoors , the Peach State native is still wearing her beige knit cap to ward off the cold .\nHere she anticipates gaining insights from stellar professors , internships , and possibly a study-abroad trip to Paris or Barcelona . At a four-year school , she says , she can \u201c be a young adult for a while , rather than just getting two years of university experience and then jumping out into a career field . \u201d\nUChicago requires applicants to write two essays , one about why they want to attend the school , and one based on their choice of five topics . \u201c Can you read and write and think ? That \u2019 s going to be a big indicator of how you do here , \u201d says admissions officer Marjorie Betley .\nTest-optional swayed Ms. Hernandez to apply , but her ability to come also depended on a broader set of policies \u2013 including financial aid \u2013 to open up access for underrepresented students . In the first round of test-optional admissions , in the fall of 2019 , UChicago \u2019 s applications jumped 20 % overall . But they went up 60 % for rural students and 24 % for first-generation students .\nIn rural communities , \u201c there \u2019 s not a lot of test prep around there ... and a lot of students are driving two , three , four hours \u201d to get to an SAT or ACT test , says Ms. Betley , director of the university \u2019 s Emerging Rural Leaders Program . \u201c Testing has never been the most important part of our application process . ... What better way to stress that than to just take [ the requirement ] away . \u201d\nMs. Hernandez \u2019 s former school , Swainsboro High School , recently hosted a test-taking session for the ACT . Among the school \u2019 s 160 seniors , just over half typically go on to college \u2013 usually within Georgia , says counselor Monica Pace .\nThose applying for public universities or scholarships have to reach a minimum SAT/ACT score , and that can motivate students to work harder on math and reading , she says . One student aimed for a scholarship that requires a 1200 on the SAT . \u201c This recent test , she was so excited , \u201d says Ms. Pace .\n\u201c I think she \u2019 s taken it three times ; she finally got her score . \u201d\nFor parents like Pat Lynch , any move away from the pervasive presence of the SAT or ACT in high schoolers \u2019 lives is welcome . Just before noon on a crisp October Saturday , Ms. Lynch is browsing a catalog in the driver \u2019 s seat of her black Volvo , waiting for her daughter to emerge from the SAT at Nashua High School North in New Hampshire . Her daughter has already taken the SAT twice at her own Roman Catholic school , and the ACT once .\n\u201c She \u2019 s having a hard time getting a decent score , and she \u2019 s a smart kid \u2013 all A \u2019 s , great GPA , four years of math , four years of science \u2013 but these tests are a lot of pressure , \u201d Ms. Lynch says .\nShe thinks her daughter will apply without scores to the three out of five colleges on her list that are test-optional . Colleges are \u201c finding out that this SAT is a racket , \u201d she says .\nNot true , say the test makers . Since a new version rolled out in 2016 , the SAT has dropped \u201c all vestiges of the aptitude approach used to develop the early SAT 100 years ago , \u201d College Board spokesman Zachary Goldberg writes in an email . \u201c Gone are the infamous \u2018 SAT words , \u2019 penalties for guessing , and math that isn \u2019 t necessary for college work . \u201d\nMs. Hernandez acknowledges that her hours spent prepping on Khan Academy , an education platform that partners with the College Board to help applicants get ready to take the exam with a free online program , did some good . \u201c I learned certain techniques in algebra ... [ and ] I got a lot of critical reading training . ... I can read extremely fast and still take a lot of things in . \u201d\nBut the tests still feel like an unnecessary requirement to many students .\n\u201c Being good at standardized testing is being good at standardized testing , \u201d says a UChicago first-year student from California who asked to keep her name private .\nFreshman Daniel Gendy says he felt a lot of pressure to compare his test scores with those of other potential applicants on college online forums . The night before he sent in his UChicago application , he decided to check the test-optional box . \u201c I was involved with my high school \u2019 s founding of a robotics team , and I wanted that or other extracurriculars , such as fencing , to represent me , \u201d he says .\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201c I was involved with my high school \u2019 s founding of a robotics team , and I wanted that or other extracurriculars , such as fencing , to represent me. \u201d \u2013 Daniel Gendy , a freshman at the University of Chicago\nSome students think too much focus on testing can be a detriment to the academic culture .\n\u201c Schools are supposed to be about learning and education and just expanding your mind as much as possible , \u201d says fourth-year UChicago economics and philosophy major Max Marcussen , who hails from a rich Connecticut town where testing and tutoring go hand in hand . With test-optional admissions , the hope is that \u201c having less emphasis on test scores means that you can focus more here on what actually matters . \u201d\nSeveral weeks into her first quarter , Ms. Hernandez dropped her calculus class . She had tested into it , and plans to take it later , but she found that having the optional fourth class in her schedule left no time for extracurriculars . Now she \u2019 s enjoying the Model United Nations club and tutoring adults for the citizenship test .\nStudents here say the curriculum challenges everyone , and they get tremendous support from professors and peer tutors . But researchers have been curious about whether the academic outcomes at test-optional schools are different for those who don \u2019 t submit exam scores . A 2018 study of 28 large and small institutions found that nonsubmitters had marginally lower first-year and cumulative college GPAs than submitters . But nonsubmitters graduated at equivalent or slightly higher rates . The report , co-authored by a test-optional supporter , showed that first-generation , low-income , female , and underrepresented minority students were more strongly represented among those who didn \u2019 t submit test scores .\nSupporters of testing say the growth of diversity on these campuses can \u2019 t necessarily be linked to test-optional policies , because the schools often offer other incentives to students , including financial ones . To help schools with their diversity goals , the College Board recently added a feature called Landscape , which helps give a fuller portrait of who students are and where they come from by putting scores in the context of neighborhood and school demographic information .\nSAT and ACT scores \u201c can be a valuable indicator for certain students , \u201d says Peter Wilson , UChicago \u2019 s director of undergraduate admissions . \u201c If the students feel like it shows their intelligence or it shows how they \u2019 re doing , we would love them to send it in . I don \u2019 t think we would ever get rid of it or say we \u2019 re going to be test-blind . \u201d\nYet that \u2019 s exactly what testing critics in California want at public universities .\nUse of the SAT and ACT is \u201c morally impermissible ... and the admissions process should no longer be contaminated by this discriminatory metric , \u201d said Mark Rosenbaum , directing attorney at the nonprofit Public Counsel , in filing a lawsuit Dec. 10 against the University of California system on behalf of students and the Compton Unified School District .\nCalifornia data from 2019 show that 45 % of white students scored 1200 or above on the SAT , compared with 9 % of African American students and 12 % of Hispanics . The University of California \u2019 s Academic Senate had already begun considering removal of the test requirement and is expected to make recommendations within a few months .\nThe growing revolt over testing could bolster a backlash against another pillar of the higher education establishment \u2013 testing-based merit aid . Some colleges , such as Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) in Massachusetts , have already stopped considering test scores when handing out discretionary scholarships .\nBreaking down the connection between \u201c so-called merit scholarships \u201d and SAT/ACT scores is \u201c the next frontier to broaden accessibility to higher education , \u201d says FairTest \u2019 s Mr. Schaeffer .\nAdmissions shifted to test-optional at WPI in 2007 . Since then , the school has not only seen diversity rise , but also retention and graduation rates . But with costs as much a barrier to entry as the admissions tests , leaders decided that tying aid to the exams could hamper their goal to broaden access to science and technology degrees .\nFirst , they stopped participating in the National Merit Scholarship Program , which requires the PSAT in junior year . But WPI \u2019 s algorithm for its own merit scholarships still used SAT/ACT scores . So in the 2016-17 cycle , the school started assigning an average test score to applicants who hadn \u2019 t submitted exam results . The next year , they cut standardized test scores completely out of the merit aid calculation .\n\u201c The public narrative that testing firms often play into is this idea that test scores are a proxy for academic quality , \u201d says Andrew Palumbo , WPI \u2019 s dean of admissions and financial aid . Once a critical mass of schools goes test-optional \u2013 particularly more nationally known universities \u2013 he believes that notion will fade . \u201c The biggest problem we have now is the legacy of standardized test scores \u2013 the myth that they are the great equalizer upon which you can put everyone side by side , \u201d he says .\nYet some schools have gone in the opposite direction . In 2013 , the University of Oregon added test scores to its merit scholarship requirements , while still considering high school GPA . The method was more transparent and the school boosted its academic profile , reports \u201c Measuring Success . \u201d\nHezekiah Owuor , for one , is happy with the approach WPI took . The student at the technical institute built a computer and taught himself to play piano , guitar , ukulele , and drums back in his hometown of Mombasa , Kenya . Now he \u2019 s the beneficiary not only of test-optional admissions , but of test-neutral merit aid as well .\n\u201c I never had the resources and facilities to be able to just simply explore , \u201d he says of his interest in combining music and computer science . Halfway through his second year at WPI , he \u2019 s planning an independent study \u201c to write code that reacts to sound and music . \u201d\nMr. Owuor sat for the SAT and the ACT in Kenya , putting in several hours of studying online each week for about a month . On top of exams for his International Baccalaureate degree , he didn \u2019 t have enough prep time to score as high as he had hoped , he says . When his counselor told him about WPI , he decided to apply without submitting his scores . He believes the school \u2019 s test-optional philosophy has not only been beneficial to him but has also had a positive effect on campus culture .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t feel like you are defined by the number that you got , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s very much an environment of innovation and what you can bring to the table \u2013 what you can do , as opposed to what this test said that you could do . \u201d",

But she felt encouraged by her small town \u2013 even the woman on the other side of the window where she went to pay her phone bill last summer asked about her plans.\n\nEyeing a major in political science and/or sociology, she says she\u2019s grateful \u201cto meet a lot more interesting people who all worked hard throughout their four years to get to someplace like this.\u201d\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201cI thought that if I hid my test scores from the school, they would ask, what are you hiding? But it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn\u2019t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn\u2019t really, in my opinion, define who I was as a person.\u201d \u2013 Esmeralda Hernandez, a student at the University of Chicago who didn\u2019t submit her SAT scores in her admissions application\n\nShe\u2019s sitting at a dark wooden table in Hutchinson Commons, an Oxford-inspired dining hall and student lounge, where the global mix of students contrasts with stately rows of UChicago presidential portraits lining the walls. But even indoors, the Peach State native is still wearing her beige knit cap to ward off the cold.\n\nHere she anticipates gaining insights from stellar professors, internships, and possibly a study-abroad trip to Paris or Barcelona. At a four-year school, she says, she can \u201cbe a young adult for a while, rather than just getting two years of university experience and then jumping out into a career field.\u201d\n\nUChicago requires applicants to write two essays, one about why they want to attend the school, and one based on their choice of five topics. \u201cCan you read and write and think? That\u2019s going to be a big indicator of how you do here,\u201d says admissions officer Marjorie Betley.\n\nTest-optional swayed Ms. Hernandez to apply, but her ability to come also depended on a broader set of policies \u2013 including financial aid \u2013 to open up access for underrepresented students. In the first round of test-optional admissions, in the fall of 2019, UChicago\u2019s applications jumped 20% overall. But they went up 60% for rural students and 24% for first-generation students.\n\nIn rural communities, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of test prep around there ... and a lot of students are driving two, three, four hours\u201d to get to an SAT or ACT test, says Ms. Betley, director of the university\u2019s Emerging Rural Leaders Program. \u201cTesting has never been the most important part of our application process. ... What better way to stress that than to just take [the requirement] away.\u201d\n\nMs. Hernandez\u2019s former school, Swainsboro High School, recently hosted a test-taking session for the ACT. Among the school\u2019s 160 seniors, just over half typically go on to college \u2013 usually within Georgia, says counselor Monica Pace.\n\nThose applying for public universities or scholarships have to reach a minimum SAT/ACT score, and that can motivate students to work harder on math and reading, she says. One student aimed for a scholarship that requires a 1200 on the SAT. \u201cThis recent test, she was so excited,\u201d says Ms. Pace.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s taken it three times; she finally got her score.\u201d\n\nBurden or achievement?\n\nFor parents like Pat Lynch, any move away from the pervasive presence of the SAT or ACT in high schoolers\u2019 lives is welcome. Just before noon on a crisp October Saturday, Ms. Lynch is browsing a catalog in the driver\u2019s seat of her black Volvo, waiting for her daughter to emerge from the SAT at Nashua High School North in New Hampshire. Her daughter has already taken the SAT twice at her own Roman Catholic school, and the ACT once.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s having a hard time getting a decent score, and she\u2019s a smart kid \u2013 all A\u2019s, great GPA, four years of math, four years of science \u2013 but these tests are a lot of pressure,\u201d Ms. Lynch says.\n\nShe thinks her daughter will apply without scores to the three out of five colleges on her list that are test-optional. Colleges are \u201cfinding out that this SAT is a racket,\u201d she says.\n\nNot true, say the test makers. Since a new version rolled out in 2016, the SAT has dropped \u201call vestiges of the aptitude approach used to develop the early SAT 100 years ago,\u201d College Board spokesman Zachary Goldberg writes in an email. \u201cGone are the infamous \u2018SAT words,\u2019 penalties for guessing, and math that isn\u2019t necessary for college work.\u201d\n\nMs. Hernandez acknowledges that her hours spent prepping on Khan Academy, an education platform that partners with the College Board to help applicants get ready to take the exam with a free online program, did some good. \u201cI learned certain techniques in algebra ... [and] I got a lot of critical reading training. ... I can read extremely fast and still take a lot of things in.\u201d\n\nBut the tests still feel like an unnecessary requirement to many students.\n\n\u201cBeing good at standardized testing is being good at standardized testing,\u201d says a UChicago first-year student from California who asked to keep her name private.\n\nFreshman Daniel Gendy says he felt a lot of pressure to compare his test scores with those of other potential applicants on college online forums. The night before he sent in his UChicago application, he decided to check the test-optional box. \u201cI was involved with my high school\u2019s founding of a robotics team, and I wanted that or other extracurriculars, such as fencing, to represent me,\u201d he says.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201cI was involved with my high school\u2019s founding of a robotics team, and I wanted that or other extracurriculars, such as fencing, to represent me.\u201d \u2013 Daniel Gendy, a freshman at the University of Chicago\n\nSome students think too much focus on testing can be a detriment to the academic culture.\n\n\u201cSchools are supposed to be about learning and education and just expanding your mind as much as possible,\u201d says fourth-year UChicago economics and philosophy major Max Marcussen, who hails from a rich Connecticut town where testing and tutoring go hand in hand. With test-optional admissions, the hope is that \u201chaving less emphasis on test scores means that you can focus more here on what actually matters.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks into her first quarter, Ms. Hernandez dropped her calculus class. She had tested into it, and plans to take it later, but she found that having the optional fourth class in her schedule left no time for extracurriculars. Now she\u2019s enjoying the Model United Nations club and tutoring adults for the citizenship test.\n\nStudents here say the curriculum challenges everyone, and they get tremendous support from professors and peer tutors. But researchers have been curious about whether the academic outcomes at test-optional schools are different for those who don\u2019t submit exam scores. A 2018 study of 28 large and small institutions found that nonsubmitters had marginally lower first-year and cumulative college GPAs than submitters. But nonsubmitters graduated at equivalent or slightly higher rates. The report, co-authored by a test-optional supporter, showed that first-generation, low-income, female, and underrepresented minority students were more strongly represented among those who didn\u2019t submit test scores.\n\nSupporters of testing say the growth of diversity on these campuses can\u2019t necessarily be linked to test-optional policies, because the schools often offer other incentives to students, including financial ones. To help schools with their diversity goals, the College Board recently added a feature called Landscape, which helps give a fuller portrait of who students are and where they come from by putting scores in the context of neighborhood and school demographic information.\n\nSAT and ACT scores \u201ccan be a valuable indicator for certain students,\u201d says Peter Wilson, UChicago\u2019s director of undergraduate admissions. \u201cIf the students feel like it shows their intelligence or it shows how they\u2019re doing, we would love them to send it in. I don\u2019t think we would ever get rid of it or say we\u2019re going to be test-blind.\u201d\n\nYet that\u2019s exactly what testing critics in California want at public universities.\n\nA growing revolt\n\nUse of the SAT and ACT is \u201cmorally impermissible ... and the admissions process should no longer be contaminated by this discriminatory metric,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum, directing attorney at the nonprofit Public Counsel, in filing a lawsuit Dec. 10 against the University of California system on behalf of students and the Compton Unified School District.\n\nCalifornia data from 2019 show that 45% of white students scored 1200 or above on the SAT, compared with 9% of African American students and 12% of Hispanics. The University of California\u2019s Academic Senate had already begun considering removal of the test requirement and is expected to make recommendations within a few months.\n\nThe growing revolt over testing could bolster a backlash against another pillar of the higher education establishment \u2013 testing-based merit aid. Some colleges, such as Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Massachusetts, have already stopped considering test scores when handing out discretionary scholarships.\n\nBreaking down the connection between \u201cso-called merit scholarships\u201d and SAT/ACT scores is \u201cthe next frontier to broaden accessibility to higher education,\u201d says FairTest\u2019s Mr. Schaeffer.\n\nAdmissions shifted to test-optional at WPI in 2007. Since then, the school has not only seen diversity rise, but also retention and graduation rates. But with costs as much a barrier to entry as the admissions tests, leaders decided that tying aid to the exams could hamper their goal to broaden access to science and technology degrees.\n\nFirst, they stopped participating in the National Merit Scholarship Program, which requires the PSAT in junior year. But WPI\u2019s algorithm for its own merit scholarships still used SAT/ACT scores. So in the 2016-17 cycle, the school started assigning an average test score to applicants who hadn\u2019t submitted exam results. The next year, they cut standardized test scores completely out of the merit aid calculation.\n\n\u201cThe public narrative that testing firms often play into is this idea that test scores are a proxy for academic quality,\u201d says Andrew Palumbo, WPI\u2019s dean of admissions and financial aid. Once a critical mass of schools goes test-optional \u2013 particularly more nationally known universities \u2013 he believes that notion will fade. \u201cThe biggest problem we have now is the legacy of standardized test scores \u2013 the myth that they are the great equalizer upon which you can put everyone side by side,\u201d he says.\n\nYet some schools have gone in the opposite direction. In 2013, the University of Oregon added test scores to its merit scholarship requirements, while still considering high school GPA. The method was more transparent and the school boosted its academic profile, reports \u201cMeasuring Success.\u201d\n\nHezekiah Owuor, for one, is happy with the approach WPI took. The student at the technical institute built a computer and taught himself to play piano, guitar, ukulele, and drums back in his hometown of Mombasa, Kenya. Now he\u2019s the beneficiary not only of test-optional admissions, but of test-neutral merit aid as well.\n\n\u201cI never had the resources and facilities to be able to just simply explore,\u201d he says of his interest in combining music and computer science. Halfway through his second year at WPI, he\u2019s planning an independent study \u201cto write code that reacts to sound and music.\u201d\n\nMr. Owuor sat for the SAT and the ACT in Kenya, putting in several hours of studying online each week for about a month. On top of exams for his International Baccalaureate degree, he didn\u2019t have enough prep time to score as high as he had hoped, he says. When his counselor told him about WPI, he decided to apply without submitting his scores. He believes the school\u2019s test-optional philosophy has not only been beneficial to him but has also had a positive effect on campus culture.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you are defined by the number that you got,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much an environment of innovation and what you can bring to the table \u2013 what you can do, as opposed to what this test said that you could do.\u201d",
