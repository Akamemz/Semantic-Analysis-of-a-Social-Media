    "content": "The best thing to do about Confederate statues is . . . nothing .\nI am never quite sure whether I am really a Southerner . Texas was in the Confederacy , but West Texas is a lot more Albuquerque than it is like Birmingham . I have never felt any sympathy for the Lost Cause . If I were building monuments to figures from that era , I \u2019 d choose Frederick Douglass , Thaddeus Stevens , or , if I \u2019 m in a mood , John Brown .\nSoutherners \u2014 and some conservative sentimentalists \u2014 tell themselves two convenient lies about the Civil War . One is that the Confederate cause was an honorable one , the other is that the war wasn \u2019 t really about slavery . Neither of those stands up to very much scrutiny , and the former is mostly false in no small part because the latter is almost entirely false .\nThere were honorable men fighting on the Southern side , to be sure , and their fight was an honorable one to the extent that risking life and limb on behalf of one \u2019 s home and people is generally honorable . General Lee is widely considered to have been an honorable military man , and so was Field Marshal Rommel . But General Lee \u2019 s cause was destroying the United States of America to facilitate slavery . The historical record , including practically every Confederate document explaining Southern separation , makes that clear enough . That the abolitionists were imperfect in their commitment to the liberation of the slaves and that there were Southern men of conscience who detested slavery and yet fought on behalf of its preserver does not change any of that . The War Between the States wasn \u2019 t about cotton tariffs .\nMany of the monuments and statues now being abominated and disassembled were not erected in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War but some years after , often in reaction to such modest advances in the political and social condition of African Americans as the early 20th century produced . Some were nothing short of consecrated shrines to white supremacy erected to Southern political powers in league with such miscreants as the Ku Klux Klan . To the extent that today \u2019 s reaction against these monuments is in essence Democrats cleaning up their own mess , there is some justice to it .\nBut there would have been some justice to it in 1938 or 1964 as well . The current attack on Confederate monuments is only another front in the Left \u2019 s endless kulturkampf . The Left is committed to always being on the offense in the culture wars , and , with Donald Trump and his white-resentment politics installed in the White House and Republicans lined up queasily behind him , the choice of going after Confederate totems is clever . It brings out the kooks and the cranks , and some respectable conservatives feel obliged to defend them . Getting Republicans to relitigate the Civil War is a great victory for the Democrats , who were , after all , on the wrong side of it as a matter of historical fact . Rather than embrace their party \u2019 s proudest and finest legacy , Republicans are now trying to explain away President Trump \u2019 s insistence that there were some very fine gentlemen among the tiki-Nazis in Charlottesville . President Trump \u2019 s schoolboy forensics is here particularly embarrassing . From Abraham Lincoln to Donald Trump : Evolution runs backward for American political parties .\nWe should not , in any case , accept the fiction that what is transpiring at the moment is a moral crusade rather than political opportunism .\nMonuments have a way of being repurposed : Rome is an overwhelmingly Christian city , and its most famous monument is the Colosseum , where Christians were put to death for sport and for political gain . ( It was , however , more common for martyrs to meet their fate at the Circus Maximus . ) A famous Roman obelisk , originally brought from Egypt by Caligula as a symbol of imperial power , today stands in St. Peter \u2019 s Square , crowned by a small reliquary believed to contain fragments of the True Cross . The Roman Catholics might have proceeded in the same way as the Taliban with Buddhist monuments , smashing every relic of their pagan forebears . The Christian world has undergone such paroxysms from time to time : Iconoclasm is puritanism in vandalism .\nThe alternative mode is that associated with the ongoing \u2014 492 years and counting \u2014 fight over the Babri mosque in India , which was , according to Hindu tradition , built on the site of a temple to Rama . In 1992 , Hindu activists sacked the mosque , setting off riots that claimed the lives of at least 2,000 people . In April of this year , India \u2019 s supreme court reinstated criminal conspiracy charges against a number of politicians involved in the episode , including L. K. Advani , a major national figure who cofounded the current ruling party . They \u2019 ll fight another 500 years over it .

Which is good : You can not walk 25 feet in Rome without seeing a monument associated with some ancient horror or a statue of some god-awful emperor , but it would be a shame if they \u2019 d all been knocked down for political or moralistic purposes .
