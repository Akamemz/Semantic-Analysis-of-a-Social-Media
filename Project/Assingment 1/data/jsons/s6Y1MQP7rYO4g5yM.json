    "content": "Opponents of same-sex marriage are scrambling to find effective responses , in Congress and state legislatures , to a rash of court rulings that would force some of America 's most conservative states to accept gay nuptials .\nSome gay-marriage foes are backing a bill recently introduced in both chambers of Congress that would leave states fully in charge of their marriage policies , though the measure stands little chance of passage . In the states , they are endorsing a multitude of bills \u2014 some intended to protect gay-marriage bans , others to assert a right , based on religious freedom , to have nothing to do with gay marriages should those bans be struck down .\nIn Utah , Oklahoma , Kentucky and Virginia , federal judges have voided part or all of the bans on same-sex marriage that voters approved between 2004 and 2006 . Each of the rulings has been stayed pending appeals , and a final nationwide resolution may be a few years away in the U.S. Supreme Court .\nThe trend is unsettling to the activists who oppose gay marriage , and some have called for extraordinary measures in response .\nAlabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , known for fighting to display the Ten Commandments in a judicial building , has written to all 50 governors urging them to support a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as between only a man and a woman .\nIn Missouri , where voters approved a gay-marriage ban in 2004 , eight Republican House members filed articles of impeachment against Democratic Gov . Jay Nixon after he ordered his administration to accept joint tax returns from same-sex couples who were legally married in other states . The Republican House leader has yet to schedule the matter for public hearings , but some GOP sponsors insist they are serious .\n`` The people put it in the constitution that marriage is between one man and one woman \u2014 the issue is the governor has absolutely ignored the constitution and the people 's will , '' said Rep. Ron Schieber , a Republican from Kansas City .\nThe demand for religious exemptions , meanwhile , is widespread . Gay marriage opponents have fought for strong exemptions in every state where lawmakers have already decided the issue . In New York , for example , gay marriage was recognized only after Gov . Andrew Cuomo and the state 's top two legislators struck an 11th-hour compromise on religious accommodations .\nHowever , the resulting exemptions have generally been limited in scope \u2014 and have n't come anywhere near to what gay marriage opponents sought . In Massachusetts and Iowa , where same-sex marriage won recognition through the courts , there are no religious exemptions related to the rulings .\nIn light of this track record , opponents in red states have been proposing pre-emptive bills with broad accommodations for religious objectors . Most of the bills aim to protect individuals or businesses who , for religious reasons , do n't want to serve same-sex couples .\nBills in Ohio , Mississippi , Arizona , Idaho and Oklahoma would allow a person or company to assert a religious freedom defense against a lawsuit from another private party . For example , a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple could defend his decision as a legally protected religious right .\nThe Kansas House passed a measure last week providing a faith-based legal shield for people who refuse to provide services to gays and lesbians . It details which services would be exempted \u2014 ranging from bakeries to adoption agencies to government clerks \u2014 and allows faith-based refusal of services to gay couples in any domestic partnership . But the top Republican in the state Senate put a quick stop to the bill 's momentum , declaring that a majority of GOP lawmakers in that chamber do n't support it .\n`` A strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage , '' said Senate President Susan Wagle . `` However , my members also do n't condone discrimination . ''\nIn South Dakota , a Republican-led Senate committee narrowly defeated a similar bill that would have barred lawsuits or criminal charges against clergy who refuse to perform same-sex weddings . Critics of the bill said it was unnecessary because the U.S. Constitution already guarantees religious freedom .\nOne of the sponsors of that measure was Rep. Steve Hickey , pastor of a Sioux Falls church that opposes gay marriage .\n`` I 'm saying keep the state out of my church , '' Hickey said at a committee hearing . `` I only promote and perform traditional marriages . ...
