( Leah Millis/Reuters )\nRacism is the headline on President Trump \u2019 s Sunday tweets \u2014 the media-Democrat complex assiduously describes them as \u201c racist tweets \u201d as if that were a fact rather than a trope . I don \u2019 t think they were racist ; I think they were abjectly stupid .\nLike many Americans , I am tired of being lectured about racism by racists and racialists , individuals whose full-field explanation for all life \u2019 s issues is this matter of genetic happenstance that should be increasingly irrelevant in a pluralistic society .\nIs it \u201c racist \u201d to tell people who have contempt for the country \u2014 who abhor the common culture that makes us American \u2014 that they ought to go back to where they came from ? It has nativist and reactionary overtones , but I don \u2019 t think it is racist . I \u2019 ll grant this much , though : It is closer to actual racism than the Left \u2019 s usual demagogic claim : I am a racist if I extend to a non-white nincompoop like Ilhan Omar the courtesy of taking her seriously as an individual and a public official , as if it were her race rather than the idiocy of what she says that moves me to dissent .\nIt would be racist to tell the progressive \u201c Squad \u201d that they don \u2019 t belong in our country because of their race or ethnic roots . I don \u2019 t understand Trump to have done that . He is attacking their radicalism , which they wear like a badge of honor .\nI don \u2019 t believe Trump is a master strategist who did this to force Speaker Pelosi and other mainstream Democrats , at their electoral peril , to embrace the radicals . That \u2019 s just the lemonade that Trump supporters are trying to make of the president \u2019 s never-ending supply of lemons . In any event , while it is beneath a president to carp in Trump \u2019 s juvenile way , I have less heartburn in principle with a president \u2019 s attacking radicalism than I do with a congresswoman \u2019 s claim that any criticism of her is an implicit criticism of immigrants , women , black people , etc .\nThe real problems here , in 2020 terms , are the stupidity and insensitivity of the president \u2019 s Twitter twaddle .\nTo tell people who are natural-born Americans that they ought to go back to the country where they originally came from is so ignorant that I would be humiliated if it were said by a child for whom I was responsible . Three of the congresswomen Trump was clearly alluding to ( despite his craven insistence on Monday that he hadn \u2019 t mentioned any names ) are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , from Yorktown Heights by way of Parkchester ( the Bronx neighborhood where I grew up ) ; Rashida Tlaib of Detroit ; and Ayanna Pressley of Chicago by way of Cincinnati . They are Americans born and bred . Representative Omar is a naturalized American from Somalia , who appears to have dabbled in some immigration and tax fraud ( you \u2019 re evidently a racist if you mention that ) , but whose politics , like those of the rest of the Squad , ooze the post-sovereign , post-citizenship , blame-America-first-ism that students imbibe on typical American college campuses .\nYet , Trump said they were from \u201c countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe , the worst , most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ( if they have a functioning government at all ) . \u201d This is indefensible jackassery . It is not an excuse that the president would have been on solid ground if he had said the congresswomen were apologists for such countries .
