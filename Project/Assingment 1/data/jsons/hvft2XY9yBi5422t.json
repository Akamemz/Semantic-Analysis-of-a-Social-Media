And she 's a mother with black sons .\nShe said she saw what happened through both lenses , but her conclusion was the same .\n`` It 's almost disbelief that you 're seeing what you 're seeing . And then you 're yelling at the screen or the monitor , 'What are you doing ? Get off of him ! ' '' she said . `` It was unbelievably , disgustingly horrific . It hurt my heart . ''\nLAPD : Chief Michel Moore apologizes after saying George Floyd 's death is on the 'hands ' of looters\nUnlike other acts of deadly force by police officers , this one has created a pivotal moment in American history , Williams said in an interview with The Arizona Republic , part of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Network . And she believes it could change the way police officers do their jobs .\n`` The level of voice that we 're seeing now is unlike anything that the world has ever seen , especially in the United States of America , '' Williams said .\nWilliams was appointed police chief in 2016 , overseeing law enforcement in the nation 's fifth-largest city .
