Panetta ordered that all available resources be used to help fend off the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack , but top administration officials \u2014 including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 put those plans on hold , according to a congressional report , which said the officials instead debated how to appease the Libyan government .\nIn a draft of its report Tuesday , the Select Committee on Benghazi said that despite clear orders from Mr. Obama and Mr. Panetta , the Pentagon moved slowly and the State Department threw up roadblocks , insisting that U.S. troops wear civilian clothing , forgo the use of wheeled vehicles and get the permission of Libyan leaders before sending help to those fighting for their lives .\nDemocrats said the report doesn \u2019 t do any new damage to Mrs. Clinton , who is their party \u2019 s likely presidential nominee .
