    "title": "An Unusual Feat in Congress: Student Loan Bill Breezes On",

    "content": "Passage of the student loan bill came the same day that House Republican leaders were forced to abruptly pull from the floor a $ 44.1 billion spending bill on transportation and housing because of a lack of votes . The bill had steep cuts that Republican moderates opposed . Community development block grants would have been cut in the coming fiscal year to $ 1.6 billion from $ 3.3 billion , a level lower than when the program began under President Gerald R. Ford .\nRepresentative Hal Rogers , the Kentucky Republican who leads the Appropriations Committee , issued an unusual broadside after the bill was pulled , saying it was now clear that the House could not pass spending bills that complied with overall financing levels set in its own austere budget plan . That suggested tough times ahead for passing required spending bills , and some pointed out that even the student loan deal almost fell victim to the same fate that has doomed other big-ticket items in Congress .\n\u201c A few months ago , at least , it seemed like everybody expected a bill that connected student loan rates to Treasury rates would move ahead without any kind of trouble , \u201d said Neal P. McCluskey , an education analyst at the Cato Institute . \u201c And it was surprising when there was . \u201d\nThe House passed a student loan plan in May . But Senate Democrats balked , saying that the borrowing rates it set were too high and would leave students and their families with too little protection from inflation and fluctuations in the financial markets . Then a coalition of liberal Democrats resisted any plan that linked rates to the financial markets , keeping a deal at bay for weeks .\nUnder the old federal student loan program , borrowers were offered a fixed rate . Under the new rate structure , which still drew opposition from nearly one-third of Senate Democrats when it passed last week , loans to undergraduates and graduate students , along with parents in the PLUS program , would be subject to a fixed rate plus the yield on the 10-year Treasury note .\nRates for loans taken out after July 1 of this year would be 3.9 percent for undergraduates , 5.4 percent for graduate students and 6.4 percent for those receiving PLUS loans . The rates are fixed over the life of the loan but would change for new borrowers each year .\nIn a compromise that pleased many Democrats who had initially been wary of using a rate that was subject to inflation and fluctuated with the markets , Congress set a cap on all loans : 8.25 percent for undergraduates , 9.5 for graduate students and 10.5 for PLUS recipients .",
