    "content": "Americans were rightfully outraged when almost 3,000 Americans were killed on 9-11 and another 6,000 injured . As a nation , we declared war in Afghanistan and have suffered more than 2,200 killed and over 20,000 injured . We value life in our country , and we do not turn a blind eye when our citizens are killed and harmed . That is why the President was correct in August 2017 when he declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency . The CDC reported that there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017 . The numbers remained just as high in 2018 . 70,000 dead Americans per year is a national crisis of unprecedented proportion . Just recently , border patrol agents in Arizona confiscated the \u201c largest seizure in U.S. history of fentanyl , the synthetic opioid blamed for the majority of overdose deaths \u201d and the overwhelming majority of which comes from Mexico .\nIt is time to elevate this national health emergency to a National Emergency under the National Emergency Act and focus on the source of opioids that are killing our people -- drug running from Mexico . Without an effective barrier , drug traffickers routinely and successfully cross the southern border to deliver death to Americans . There are currently 32 National Emergencies declared , not one of which is killing even one U.S. Citizen . With the yearly carnage of our people exceeding the entire death toll for the 12-year Vietnam War , there is no rational basis to conclude this isn \u2019 t a national emergency .\nHere are the benefits of declaring a national emergency : First , that is what this is . 70,000 dead year-in and year-out is a catastrophe of unprecedented levels . Second , in addition to the opioid deaths , due to drugs coming from Mexico , we have the problem of gang members and criminals sashaying across the border and inflicting mayhem in our nation . Every death and injury inflicted upon an American citizen by an illegal alien is a preventable crime if we had an effective barrier . Illegal aliens do not belong in our country and have no right to be here in the first place . Thousands of Americans would still be alive today , reunited with their families , but for the millions of illegal aliens here committing crimes on a daily basis .\nThis seems simple , tens of thousands of Americans are dying , and therefore it should be considered a national emergency . But the open border globalists crowd doesn \u2019 t seem to care about the families and communities being torn apart by the river of narcotics flowing from south of the border . Indeed , many are misguided and blame their doctors or pharmacies when the carnage is from illegal heroin and fentanyl .\nLet \u2019 s look at the 32 other National Emergencies that are ongoing . On November 3 , 1997 , President Clinton declared a National Emergency , blocking Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Sudan . No one complained about this .\nOn October 27 , 2006 , President Bush declared a National Emergency , Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . This was in response to violence around the Congolese presidential election runoff .\nJust last week , the President declared a National Emergency with EO 13857 , Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency with Respect to Venezuela .
