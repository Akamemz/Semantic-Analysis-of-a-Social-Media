Bowe Berdahl over the weekend , the circumstances surrounding the release \u2014 and the sudden freeing of five Taliban figures held at the Guantanamo detainee prison \u2014 were producing a full-scale controversy in Washington .\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel insisted the U.S. did not negotiate with terrorists in the process of exchanging the transfer of the five terrorism suspects for the release of Sgt . Bergdahl , now 28 , who had been in Taliban hands since June 2009 .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t negotiate with terrorists , \u201d Mr. Hagel said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c And I said and explained before , Sgt . Bergdahl is a prisoner of war . That \u2019 s a normal process in getting your prisoners back . \u201d\nSgt . Bergdahl arrived at a U.S. military hospital in Germany Sunday after he was handed over to U.S. special operations forces by the Taliban Saturday , with the government of Qatar serving as a go-between .\nIn an emotional press conference Sunday afternoon in Boise , Idaho , Sgt . Bergdahl \u2019 s father , Bob , likened his son \u2019 s return to a deep-sea diver resurfacing and urged a gradual re-assimilation process .\nSEE ALSO : GOP lawmakers warn of Taliban incentives in freeing American POW\n\u201c If he comes up too fast , it could kill him , \u201d said Mr. Bergdahl , thanking supporters and government officials for their help in the process . \u201c The recovery and rehabilitation of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress . \u201d\nJani Bergdahl told her son to give himself all the time he needs to recover .\n\u201c I love you , Bowe \u2014 I \u2019 m so very proud of you , \u201d she said . \u201c We praise God for your freedom . \u201d\nAdministration officials too said the focus right now should be on the fact that the only U.S. POW from the Afghan conflict is coming back home , even as President Obama is winding down the 13-year war there .\nNational Security Adviser Susan E. Rice told CNN that what officials did was ensure that the United States doesn \u2019 t leave a man or woman on the battlefield .\n\u201c And in order to do this \u2014 it \u2019 s very important for folks to understand , if we got into a situation where we said , you know , because of who has captured an American soldier on the battlefield , we will leave that person behind , we would be in a whole new era for the safety of our personnel and for the nature of our commitment to our men and women in uniform , \u201d Ms. Rice said . \u201c So [ just ] because the Taliban had him did not mean that we had any less of an obligation to bring him back . \u201d\nBut complicating the administration \u2019 s narrative was a rare public statement Sunday from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , who said the prisoner swap marked a \u201c great victory \u201d for the Islamist movement that led the military resistance against the U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan for more than a decade .\n\u201c The sacrifice of our mujahedeen have resulted in the release of our senior leaders from the hand of the enemy , \u201d Mullah Mohammed Omar said .\nMs. Rice and other administration officials insisted that , at the diplomatic level , the U.S. was negotiating with the government of Qatar , not the Taliban or its Afghan allies . But the handover followed secret and indirect negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban , and Qatar is taking custody of five of the Afghan detainees that had been held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .\nThe detainees are believed to be the most senior Afghans still held at the prison : Abdul Haq Wasiq , Mullah Norullah Nori , Khairullah Khairkhwa , Mohammed Nabi and Mohammad Fazl . Mr. Obama \u2019 s efforts to close the detainee site have been frustrated by opposition from both parties in Congress .\nRepublican critics Sunday criticized both the abrupt manner in which the Taliban prisoners were traded \u2014 with almost no advance warning to lawmakers \u2014 and the potential precedent the deal could set in dealing with other terrorist enemies .\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. \u201c Buck \u201d McKeon said that the released detainees are \u201c five very dangerous guys that should not leave Guantanamo [ and ] should not have the opportunity to get back into this fight . \u201d\n\u201c And now we have set a precedent \u2014 the president has set a precedent , \u201d the California Republican said Sunday on CNN . \u201c You know , he has violated the law and flouted the Constitution so many times . We have real concerns about this . They \u2019 re not following the law . They know they \u2019 re not following the law . \u201d\nAdded Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , speaking on ABC News , \u201c What does this tell terrorists \u2014 that if you capture a U.S. soldier you can trade that soldier for five terrorists ? \u201d\nSen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said the administration assured him just six months ago they would not consider the release of the leaders without consulting Congress .\n\u201c The security assurances the United States has been given regarding these terrorists is feeble at best , and I fear it is only a matter of time before they resume their terrorist activities , \u201d he said . \u201c These men are not soldiers ; they are dangerous terrorists , and President Obama should be treating them as such . \u201d\nBut Idaho \u2019 s all-Republican congressional delegation hailed the move .
