    "content": "The U.S. economy was unexpectedly strong in the fourth quarter of last year after a spurt of faster growth in the second and third quarters , with consumers keeping up spending and businesses expanding investment amid fears of higher interest rates and a rocky stock market .\nGross domestic product\u2014the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. , adjusted for inflation\u2014expanded at an annual rate of 2.6 percent for the months October through December , the Commerce Department said Thursday . That marked a slowdown from the 3.4 percent growth rate registered in the July through September period and the booming 4.2 percent rate in the April through June .\nThis was the weakest growth rate since the first quarter of 2018 . But it was faster than expected . Economists had expected the Commerce Department to report a 2.2 percent growth rate . The Atlanta Fed \u2019 s GDPNOW model had pointed to even weaker growth of just 1.8 percent .\nThe \u201c initial \u201d fourth-quarter GDP estimate was released a month late , when the government would typically issue its second read of GDP , because of the government shutdown .\nEconomists think the economy will continue to grow throughout 2019 , thanks to a very strong labor market that continues to enjoy ultralow unemployment rate , robust job growth , and steady wage growth . The Federal Reserve pivoted in January from a policy of gradually raising rates to one of \u201c patience , \u201d a move which many see as supporting further growth and that has buoyed financial markets at the start of the year . The Fed predicts GDP will grow 2.3 percent this year .\nBut growth is expected to be lower this year , not touching the heights of last year \u2019 s summer and fall . Some economists think the economy could fall into a recession in 2020 , which might weigh on voters in that year \u2019 s presidential election .\nConsumer spending slowed but not by as much as many economists expected . This rose at an inflation-adjusted , annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter . Spending on durable goods actually increased , defying expectations that trade fights and tariffs would drag on this area of the economy , while spending on services and nondurable goods slowed .\nAlso defying predictions of a trade fight slowdown was a rise in business investment . Nonresidential fixed investment\u2013a category that includes research and development spending , software and equipment purchases\u2013grew at a 6.2 percent rate , much higher than the 2.5 percent rate recorded in the prior quarter . This seems to indicate that the tax cuts are boosting business investment , something Trump administration economists predicted but many outside the administration thought was unlikely .\nInflation was muted in the fourth quarter . The price index for personal consumption expenditures , a measure of inflation that tracks \u2013 but is different from \u2013 the better known Consumer Price Index , rose at a 1.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter . Core inflation\u2013which excludes food and energy\u2013was up just 1.7 percent .
