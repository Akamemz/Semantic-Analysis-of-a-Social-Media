That is the case with tweets from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama two days ago in response to the mass murder of more than 300 Christians and others in Sri Lanka .\nTheir tweets are worth serious analysis because they reveal a great deal about the left . Of course , they reveal a great deal about Clinton and Obama , too , but that does n't interest me .\nAnd that , too , is important . Many Americans -- especially conservatives and `` independents '' -- are more interested in individual politicians than in political ideologies .\nMany conservatives have long been fixated on Clinton -- so much so that probably any other Democrat would have defeated Donald Trump , as conservative anger specifically toward her propelled many people to the polls . Similarly , Republican Never-Trumpers are fixated on Trump rather than policy . They care more about Trump 's personal flaws than about the mortal dangers the left poses to America and the West or about the uniquely successful conservative policies Trump promulgates .\nAnd independents all claim to vote `` for the person , not the party . ''\nOnly leftists understand that one must vote left no matter who the Democrat is , no matter who the Republican opponent is . Leftists are completely interchangeable : There is no ideological difference among the 20 or so Democrats running for president . Mayor Pete Buttigieg is not one degree to the right of Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren .\nThat is why it is important to understand Clinton and Obama 's tweets : to understand the left , not to understand her or him .\nObama : `` The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity . On a day devoted to love , redemption , and renewal , we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka . ''\nThree hours later , Clinton tweeted : `` On this holy weekend for many faiths , we must stand united against hatred and violence . I 'm praying for everyone affected by today 's horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka . ''\nAs they both spelled `` worshipers '' the same idiosyncratic way and used the term `` Easter worshippers , '' it is likely they either had the same writers or Clinton copied Obama .\nHere 's what 's critical : Neither used the word `` Christians . '' And in order to avoid doing so , they went so far as to make up a new term -- `` Easter worshippers '' -- heretofore unknown to any Christian .\nWhen Jews were murdered at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh , Clinton mentioned the synagogue in a tweet . But in her post-Sri Lanka tweet , despite the bombing of three churches filled with Christians , Clinton made no mention of church or churches . In a tweet after the massacre of Muslims in New Zealand , she wrote that her heart broke for `` the global Muslim community . '' But in her latest tweet , not a word about Christians or the global Christian community .\nObama similarly wrote in his tweet about New Zealand that he was grieving with `` the Muslim community '' over the `` horrible massacre in the Mosques . '' But in his tweet about Sri Lanka , there is no mention of Christians or churches .\nThe reason neither of them mentioned Christians or churches is that the left has essentially forbidden mention of all the anti-Christian murders perpetrated by Muslims in Europe , the Middle East and Africa and of all the Muslim desecration of churches in Europe , Africa and anywhere else .
