My own people , the Acoma , Haaku , were attacked by Spanish conquistadors seeking retaliation for an earlier fight that resulted in the deaths of 12 conquistadors . As punishment , they took the right foot of men over the age of 25 . They stole many of our women and sold them off as slaves in Mexico . This is not the only massacre rarely taught in schools .

The movement of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women , # MMIW , has been going on for years , but the media mostly ignored it until the killing of pregnant Savanna Grey Wind and the taking of her baby in North Dakota in 2017 . Meanwhile , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported murder as the third leading cause of death for American Indian Women and Alaskan Natives between the ages of 10-24 . In 2016 , according to an Urban Indian Health Institute report , there were 5,712 cases of missing American Indian and Alaskan Native women .

And while we have been told by dominant society to \u201c get over it \u201d and to assimilate , all we Native people want to do is remember and honor those who gave their lives so we could be here . We don \u2019 t need to be reminded that general American society is so disinterested in , and disrespectful of , our culture that they choose to perform nonsense chants , while costumed in our clothes , to minimize our entire race into a goofy caricature for sport .\nToo many people don \u2019 t care about Native Americans unless they can use our likeness for their companies , cars , or costumes .

For example , Native people respect the drum , and that drum is never used in the presence of alcohol . War Paint is used to mark our horses and warriors to protect them . Using our cultural ways to \u201c pump up \u201d your team is disrespectful and racist .\nI met a man a couple of months ago in Lawrence , Kansas , who was a member of the Boy Scouts of America \u2019 s Tribe of Mic-o-Say , whose members dress up as Native Americans and do powwow dances . The Mic-o-Say are based in Missouri and eastern Kansas and state their mission is \u201c to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Scout Law. \u201d The group was founded by H.

He refused to believe that his dressing up as a Native American is cultural appropriation , instead saying the clothing and dances \u201c honor \u201d Native Americans by continuing their traditions .\nI asked him how he feels about people who pretend to be veterans when they are not . That is what the Native headdress equates to : Chiefs went to battle and earned it , much like the medals military veterans earn . But he refused to see the correlation .\nIt saddens me that the city I work in continues to celebrate the racist \u201c tomahawk chop. \u201d I have heard it at concerts , in commercials for grocery stores .
