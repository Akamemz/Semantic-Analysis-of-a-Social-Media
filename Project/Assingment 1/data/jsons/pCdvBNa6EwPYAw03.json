    "content": "Donald Trump wants to regulate social media , while Democrats want to regulate political spending . Both are prepared to sacrifice freedom of speech on the altar of fairness , balance , and equality .\nThe president 's plan for fighting anti-conservative bias on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook is still in flux . But it reportedly includes siccing the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) on companies that are deemed to be removing content for political or ideological reasons .\nAccording to a summary of a proposed executive order obtained by CNN , one possible approach involves reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which protects `` interactive computer service providers '' from liability for state crimes and many kinds of torts based on content produced by others . Section 230 , which has been crucial to the development of the internet as we know it , also shields websites from liability for `` any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene , lewd , lascivious , filthy , excessively violent , harassing , or otherwise objectionable . ''\nThose two provisions are supposed to protect online forums , including all manner of blogs , vendors , review sites , and news outlets as well as the major social media platforms , from potentially crippling lawsuits triggered either by their failure to remove all arguably illegal posts or by their decisions to remove content they view as problematic . The idea is to give websites the freedom to exercise some editorial discretion without requiring them to exert comprehensive control over user-produced content , which would be fatal to social media in their current form .\nThe proposed executive order , CNN reports , would ask the FCC to `` find that social media sites do not qualify for the good-faith immunity if they remove or suppress content '' and `` the decision is proven to be evidence of anticompetitive , unfair or deceptive practices . '' The FTC , meanwhile , would `` work with the FCC to develop a report investigating how tech companies curate their platforms and whether they do so in neutral ways . ''\nRemoving Section 230 protection from platforms that bureaucrats consider biased , a policy similar to one proposed by Sen.

''\nWhile Trump is using the language of free speech to support a policy that would undermine it , Senate Democrats are taking a more direct approach , unanimously backing a constitutional amendment that would authorize `` reasonable '' limits on election-related spending . The Supreme Court has categorically rejected such limits , noting that they `` place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates , citizens , and associations to engage in protected political expression , restrictions that the First Amendment can not tolerate .
