    "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden surged to victory in Super Tuesday contests across the South and beyond , while Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , claimed gold with a sizable win in delegate-prize California \u2013 divvying up the map on the biggest primary day of the season and indicating a tight battle between the two that is likely to drag on for weeks or more .\nIt emerged after midnight Wednesday that Biden had narrowly defeated Sanders in Texas , the second-biggest contest of the day . With 90 percent of precincts reporting , Biden was ahead of Sanders 33.3 percent to 29.3 percent , or 602,352 votes to 531,626 votes . The two candidates are likely to receive a similar share of the state 's 228 pledged delegates .\nBiden had courted Texans as establishment support suddenly built for his campaign , even hosting a rally in Dallas on Monday night featuring a surprise appearance by former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke . Onetime rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar , as well as several Obama administration officials , endorsed Biden 's presidential bid within the past week .\nIn a worrying sign for Sanders , who had expected to perform well in the state , Maine 's race call is still outstanding . With 71 percent of precincts reporting , Sanders and Biden are within two percentage points .\nThe former vice president \u2019 s comeback was remarkable given his poor performances in Iowa , New Hampshire , and Nevada earlier this year , which left many pundits declaring his campaign dead in the water . Biden won the most contests Tuesday \u2013 though who came out ahead in the delegate race remains unclear \u2013 and certainly outperformed expectations from just a week ago .\n`` I 'm here to report : We are very much alive ! And make no mistake about it , this campaign will send Donald Trump packing , '' the 77-year-old Biden told fired-up supporters in Los Angeles Tuesday night .\nBiden \u2019 s weekend win in South Carolina and the decision by 2020 rivals to bow out and endorse him were undeniable factors \u2013 especially in Minnesota , which he won after backing from Klobuchar , the home-state senator .\nNext week 's Mar . 10 primary in Michigan will be Biden 's next test as he seeks to demonstrate that he can reliably overcome Sanders ' appeal in the Midwest .\nBiden so far is projected to win Texas , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Virginia , Tennessee , Alabama , North Carolina , Arkansas , and Oklahoma . Sanders handily won his home state of Vermont and later racked up wins in Colorado and Utah , in addition to California , Fox News projects .\nCalifornia and its 415 delegates amounted to the biggest prize on the map on Tuesday , and Sanders was ahead by 9 percentage points with 58 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday .\nIn every state voting on Tuesday , candidates who fail to receive 15 percent of the vote either statewide or in a congressional district leave empty-handed . Candidates who clear the 15 percent threshold receive a proportional share of delegates .\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN REBUFFS COMEY ENDORSEMENT : 'HOW DO I RETURN IT ? '\nBiden was on track to hit that threshold in California -- but former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg was also performing well in the state , and it remained likely Sanders would ultimately take home by far the most delegates there .\n`` We 're gon na win the Democratic nomination , and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country , '' Sanders told cheering supporters late Tuesday in Essex Junction , Vermont , as the crowd erupted in chants of `` Bernie ! ''\n`` We 're not only taking on the corporate establishment , '' Sanders added . `` We 're taking on the political establishment . '' He slammed Biden for voting to authorize the war in Iraq , backing trade agreements that `` cost us millions of good-paying jobs , '' and seeking to cut Social Security funding .\nWho comes out ahead in the delegate race is still being assessed , because they are allocated proportionally and not all votes have been counted . Approximate total delegate counts through Super Tuesday are 660 for Biden , 586 for Sanders , 110 for Bloomberg , and 101 for Warren .\nBiden 's southern-state victories were valuable : Virginia is worth 99 pledged delegates , North Carolina is worth 110 , Alabama is worth 52 , Tennessee is worth 64 and Arkansas is worth 31 . Oklahoma is worth 37 , while Massachusetts is worth 91 and Minnesota is worth 75 .\nBy contrast , Vermont is worth just 16 delegates , while Utah is worth 29 and Colorado 67 . California will help close that gap for Sanders .\nFor their part , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bloomberg have openly suggested they could stay in the running until the Democratic National Convention . It 's unclear whether their poor showing on Super Tuesday will lead them to reconsider .\nWarren will finish a drastically disappointing third in her home state , and Fox News projects Sanders will place ahead of her in second .\nThe results were also a disaster for Bloomberg , who spent half a billion dollars on his campaign and sought to present himself as the only truly electable candidate in the race . Bloomberg was on the primary ballot for the first time on Tuesday .\nHowever , there was at least one bright spot for the high-spending billionaire as the votes rolled in . Bloomberg picked up five delegates American Samoa , according to an Associated Press projection . Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was slated to win one delegate there .\nBIDEN VOWS GUN-CONTROL GIG FOR O'ROURKE , WHO ADVOCATES SEIZURE OF ASSAULT RIFLES\nAddressing supporters in Florida Tuesday night , Bloomberg acknowledged he may be in for a rough night , even as he declared that `` we proved we can win the voters who will decide the general election . ''\n`` No matter how many delegates we win tonight , we have done something no-one thought was possible , '' Bloomberg said . `` In three months we 've gone from one percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president . ''\nIn response to an NBC News report that the Bloomberg campaign would `` reassess '' its role in the race on Wednesday , Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told Fox News : \u201c Everyday the campaign is re-evaluating . ''\nPreviously , Bloomberg has strongly hinted that he 's not going anywhere regardless of what happens on Tuesday . At a Fox News Town Hall on Monday , Bloomberg suggested he might take his bid to the Democratic National Convention , where he said `` horse-trading '' could decide the nominee .\nWarren has similarly vowed to take her campaign all the way to the convention in a `` final play '' and is seeking to at least hold her home state .\n`` My name is Elizabeth Warren and I 'm the woman who 's going to beat Donald Trump , '' Warren assured supporters Tuesday .\nA total of 14 states were voting Tuesday . To win the nomination , candidates must receive 1,991 of the total 3,979 pledged delegates at the Democratic National Convention ( DNC ) this summer in Milwaukee , Wis .\nIf no candidate receives a majority on the first ballot , hundreds of so-called `` superdelegates , '' or party insiders , are allowed to cast their ballots . Roughly one-third of the 3,979 total delegates were at stake on Tuesday .\nMeanwhile , Democrats looked for answers to explain Biden 's sudden rise . Sanders had the endorsement of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar , but fell well short in the state . In a tweet , Omar suggested Warren 's continuing presence in the race may have played a role in Sanders ' defeat there and elsewhere .\n`` Imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated , who would have won ? '' Omar wrote . `` That \u2019 s what we should be analyzing . I feel confident a united progressive movement would have allowed for us to # BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost . ''\nAnd , mystical author Marianne Wiliamson , who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year and endorsed Sanders , accused the Democratic Party of conspiring to undermine the democratic socialist 's surging campaign at the last moment .\n`` Jake Tapper referred to the 'resurrection ' of Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign , '' she wrote . `` This was not a resurrection ; it was a coup . Russiagate was not a coup . Mueller was not a coup . Impeachment was not a coup . What happened yesterday was a coup . And we will push it back . ''\nShe later deleted the tweet , but wrote another : `` Elite Republicans don \u2019 t respect democracy ; elite Democrats don \u2019 t trust democracy . Real power in the hands of the people is a threat that neither of them can abide . ''\nEven as the results continued to come in , other politicians and pundits began drawing their own conclusions .\n`` I think Mini Mike is out after tonight , '' Eric Trump remarked , referring to Bloomberg . `` Where is he to be found tonight ? I do n't think he has a chance of winning any state . I do n't think he has a chance of getting to the 15 percent threshold in many of the states . ''\nAdded the president : `` The biggest loser tonight , by far , is Mini Mike Bloomberg . His 'political ' consultants took him for a ride . $ 700 million washed down the drain , and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike , and the complete destruction of his reputation . Way to go Mike ! ''\n`` Elizabeth 'Pocahontas ' Warren , other than Mini Mike , was the loser of the night , '' Trump went on , before deploying a reference to what he has called Warren 's infamous Instagram `` beer catastrophe '' when she launched her campaign .\n`` She didn \u2019 t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts , '' Trump said . `` Well , now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer !
