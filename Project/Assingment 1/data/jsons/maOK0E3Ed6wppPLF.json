    "content": "In her infamous lecture about \u201c smart power \u201d in 2014 , Hillary Clinton said that American leaders must \u201c understand \u201d and \u201c empathize \u201d with Islamic terrorists . She has the empathy down but not the understanding .\nShe still can \u2019 t grasp the obvious theological motivation of the Islamic terrorists , which comes not from what they read in American newspapers but from what they read in the Koran and the Hadith . Whether American leaders are praising or condemning Islam is irrelevant to them . For almost sixteen years , America \u2019 s feckless political class , which Hillary epitomizes , has fostered the delusion that if leaders just spoke more soothingly about Islam its militancy would dissipate . Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama fatuously declared that America is not at \u201c war with Islam \u201d even as it leading imams declared war on America . Bush and Obama talked endlessly about Islam as a religion of peace . Meanwhile , the terrorist tentacles of Islam just grew longer and longer .\nAfter every eruption of Islamic terrorism , Americans have been instructed by the ruling class \u2019 s propagandists not to see it as evidence of a \u201c religious war. \u201d But it is a religious war , with the exception that only one side is fighting it . In Hillary \u2019 s flailing and stale claim that rhetorical intemperance is provoking Islamic terrorism , ISIS can take true comfort , insofar as it signals yet another white flag in the war . Nothing encourages an enemy more than the prospect of victory against a weak opponent .\nIn a warbling Hillary , clinging desperately to the clich\u00e9s of a failed political class , Americans see little \u201c resolve \u201d and a lot of \u201c fear. \u201d Anybody wondering what her administration would look like just had to watch the pathetic response of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and New York governor Andrew Cuomo to last weekend \u2019 s terrorist attack . Looking like a tranquilized giraffe , de Blasio surveyed the scene and concluded that it revealed evidence of \u201c intentional \u201d behavior but not terrorism , while a casually dressed Cuomo bumptiously asserted that it did not point to \u201c international terrorism. \u201d Anybody wondering what the priorities of her administration would be just had to read the New York Times on the day of the attack , which featured a story about \u201c hate crimes against American Muslims . \u201d\nThe story is full of biased hedges , sources , and information so incomplete as to be meaningless . It is a story about an \u201c apparent increase \u201d in hate crimes that are \u201c apparently fueled by terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad and by divisive language on the campaign trail , \u201d with \u201c some scholars \u201d believing that Donald Trump is responsible for it . The story has all the objectivity of a press release from CAIR .\nStraining to make this supposed spike in Trump-fueled hate crimes sound menacing , the Times reports that somebody back in May claimed that a Trump supporter once \u201c reportedly poured liquid on a Muslim woman \u201d in Washington , D.C. We \u2019 re not told what the liquid was ( water ? ) or if there was any proof or resolution to the complaint . On such shaky and fragmentary information , the Times alleges a \u201c problem \u201d and then tells us that \u201c researchers say \u201d the lack of proof of hate crimes is itself proof of them and even proof that the problem is greater than anyone can fathom , since \u201c victims are often reluctant to report attacks for fear of inflaming community tensions , and because it is sometimes difficult for investigators to establish that religious , ethnic or racial hatred was a cause . \u201d\nSuch are the preoccupations of Hillary \u2019 s envisioned America , where the ruling class extends empathy to every culture except its own . No sooner had the Islamic terrorist been caught on Monday than she and her supporters resumed their babble about cultural relativism . Cuomo hit the airwaves to warn against the loss of \u201c American values , \u201d as if the founding fathers shared his blindness to the militancy of Islam . Hillary surrogates criticized Trump for not appreciating the terrorist \u2019 s right to the best hospitals and attorneys .
