R. McMaster that was trying to reestablish U.S. deterrence . Stranger still , it is hard to understand how Carl Schmitt \u2019 s Nazi-party membership and advocacy ( begun formally as early as 1933 ) were in any sense \u201c tragic \u201d rather than vile . And if the subordinate is supposedly Carl Schmitt , what then would Kristol call his boss , the iconic McMaster ? Goebbels ?

Mrs. Bush has apparently forgotten that the warped comparison to the Japanese interment was used as a slur against her husband during the Abu Ghraib mess and also after the announcement of the administration \u2019 s forced renditions of terrorist suspects to foreign countries .

In 1964 , California governor Pat Brown suggested that the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater had \u201c the stench of fascism. \u201d Brown added , \u201c All we need to hear was \u2018 Heil Hitler. \u2019 \u201d After 1980 , leftists used the Nazi slur frequently against Ronald Reagan .\n\u201c Nazi ! \u201d was also a familiar favorite of the Left during the George W.

If George W.

One answer might be to take out Trump-Hitler , or take up arms to stop his Nazi takeover of the U.S. , or force the target of such slurs to submit to reeducation to cleanse and reset his mind in a properly correct fashion .\nPerhaps such logic is one reason we simultaneously see both the rise of Nazi slurs and the hyperbolic talk of killing a conservative president . Assassination chic also did not begin with Donald Trump , although David Crosby , Johnny Depp , Kamala Harris , Madonna , Rosie O \u2019 Donnell , Snoop Dogg , Kathy Griffin , and the Free Shakespeare in the Park troupe have by now exhausted the methods by which to rhetorically liquidate Trump ( incineration , shooting by pistol , death by elevator , explosives , jumping off a cliff , shooting by automatic weapon , beheading , and stabbing by a mob ) .\nYet we forget that in 2012 , in an episode of HBO \u2019 s Game of Thrones , a model of the chopped-off head of George W.
