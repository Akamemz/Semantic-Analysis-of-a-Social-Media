And a spike in homicides occurred after those laws were changed .\nTrump also called Chicago \u201c a disaster. \u201d That \u2019 s an opinion , but it \u2019 s worth noting that other cities \u2013 some with less stringent gun laws \u2013 have higher rates of gun violence .\nExperts also warn against cherry-picking cities to score political points , as examples can be found to fit arguments on either side . They also note that Chicago , which has stricter laws than most cities , is bordered by states that have relatively lax gun laws . And there is some evidence that most of the guns confiscated from crimes in Chicago come from out of state .\nFinally , as we have written before , there is no evidence that gun control laws result in higher murder rates . In fact , studies suggest the opposite : States with a higher number of firearm restrictions have lower firearm deaths . But there is only an association between gun control laws and firearm deaths , not a causal relationship , studies show .\nTrump \u2019 s latest comment about Chicago gun crime came when he was asked if he would consider any gun control policies in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5 .\n\u201c I mean , you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation , is Chicago , and Chicago is a disaster , \u201d Trump said during a press conference in Korea on Nov. 7 . \u201c It \u2019 s a total disaster . \u201d\nThis is a longstanding talking point for Trump , who tweeted in July 2014 :\nThe most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 10 , 2014\nTrump made the same point during the third presidential debate , saying : \u201c In Chicago , which has the toughest gun laws in the United States , probably you could say by far , they have more gun violence than any other city . \u201d\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim during a press briefing on Oct. 2 after the Las Vegas mass shooting . \u201c I think if you look to Chicago , where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year , they have the strictest gun laws in the country , \u201d Sanders said . \u201c That certainly hasn \u2019 t helped there . \u201d\nHere are some facts about gun violence in Chicago and what they say , and don \u2019 t say , about the role of gun control .\nDoes Chicago Have \u2018 the Strongest Gun Laws in Our Country \u2019 ?\nChicago used to have what some considered to be the toughest gun laws in the country . But not anymore .\nIn 2010 , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Chicago \u2019 s handgun ban . In the year before the court \u2019 s ruling , Chicago \u2019 s murder rate in 2009 was 16.1 . The city with the highest murder rate that year was New Orleans at 51.7 murders for every 100,000 people .\nAnd in 2013 , Chicago also abolished its requirement that gun owners register their weapons . The move was made to come into compliance with the state \u2019 s court-mandated concealed carry law .\n\u201c Chicago does have strong municipal laws , but we wouldn \u2019 t say it has the strongest gun laws in the country , because the strongest regulations in Chicago have been largely implemented by entire states , including New York and California , \u201d Hannah Shearer , a staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , told us via email . \u201c In contrast , the state of Illinois has significantly weaker laws than New York and California , including a shall-issue concealed carry permit system . \u201d\nThe Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave a B+ grade to Illinois in its latest \u201c Gun Law State Scorecard. \u201d Seven states had a higher grade .\nIt \u2019 s true that the total number of murders in Chicago spiked in 2016 . The number of murders recorded that year \u2014 764 \u2014 was nearly 58 percent higher than in 2015 . In raw numbers , that was higher than any other major city in the U.S. , according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association .\nThe per-capita murder rate in Chicago \u2013 the number of homicides per 100,000 residents \u2013 was 27.9 in 2016 . That \u2019 s half the rate recorded by St. Louis , at 59.3 , which saw 188 murders in 2016 . Among major cities , Chicago \u2019 s rate was eighth highest in 2016 . ( Ninety-three percent of the murders in the city that year involved firearms . )\nAnd again , those high tallies in 2016 came after Chicago did away with its gun registry and ban on handguns .\nIt should also be noted that the number of homicides in Chicago is trending down so far this year . According to the Sun-Times , there were 580 homicides in the first 10 months of 2017 , down 10 percent from the 644 homicides recorded during the same period in 2016 .\nShootings and homicides in Chicago \u201c are still high by urban American standards right now , but the trend appears to be downward , \u201d John Pfaff , a professor of law at Fordham Law School , told us via email . \u201c There \u2019 s still two months in the year , but that pushes back against the \u2018 disaster \u2019 story . \u201d\nShearer also notes that \u201c Chicago is vulnerable to guns coming in from neighboring states . A few states bordering Chicago , such as Indiana , have extremely weak gun laws . \u201d\nA 2017 gun trace report from the Chicago Police Department found that since 2013 the \u201c overwhelming majority \u201d of recovered \u201c crime guns \u201d that were traceable \u201c were originally purchased outside of the city limits and brought into Chicago. \u201d And the majority were from other states .\nPfaff added the caveat that police could only trace 12,500 of the 28,000 guns seized during the study period , so the origin of most guns could not be determined .\nStill , the report suggests that many of the guns used in Chicago crimes come from outside the city \u2014 watering down the effectiveness that any local gun laws might have . And so experts warn it would be unwise to draw definitive conclusions , as the president did , about the effectiveness of gun control efforts in Chicago .\n\u201c That is a silly argument , \u201d David Hemenway , director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center , told us via email . \u201c That would be similar to someone arguing that pest control doesn \u2019 t work with an example where only one kitchen is treated in an apartment complex filled with cockroaches . Chicago is surrounded by easy places for criminals to get guns . \u2026 There are lots of places where gun control ( and pest control ) has a much better chance to work and does work . \u201d\nDo Stricter Gun Laws Lead to Higher or Lower Homicide Rates ?\nAs for the president \u2019 s implication that stricter gun laws either don \u2019 t work or lead to higher rates of homicide , studies suggest that \u2019 s not the case . In fact , they show an association , but not a proven causal relationship , between strict gun laws and lower rates of gun violence .\nAccording to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence scorecard , seven states graded as having the strongest gun laws also were among those with the lowest gun death rates .\nAnd as we have written before ( on severaloccasions ) , several studies have shown that states with a higher number of firearm restrictions have lower firearm deaths . But there is only an association between gun control laws and firearm deaths , not a causal relationship , studies show . In other words , the studies do not prove that the stricter laws are responsible for lower homicide rates .\nIt \u2019 s misleading for Trump to cite Chicago as evidence that gun control laws don \u2019 t reduce gun violence . Chicago no longer has \u201c the strongest gun laws in our nation , \u201d and it doesn \u2019 t have nearly the highest homicide rate among major cities . Most traceable guns recovered from crimes also come from outside the city limits .\nTexas shooting prompts congressional GOP to talk about fixing background checks",
