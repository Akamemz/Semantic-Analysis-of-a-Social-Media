Golvach said :\nHe needs to go pick out one of his own little darling children to sacrifice to the God of cheap labor instead of living behind security walls and allowing other people \u2019 s kids to get chosen . When it comes to doing what \u2019 s right for the donor class and their cheap foreign labor pool , Paul Ryan is willing to fight to the last drop of American \u2019 s blood . He is not a public servant . He \u2019 s a servant to the oligarch and nothing more . Most Americans , regardless of their politician leanings , are aware of this .\nPaul Ryan has a two-decade-long history of pushing for open borders immigration policies . In 2013 , Ryan joined Luis Gutierrez \u2014 who previously said \u201c I have only one loyalty\u2026 and that \u2019 s to the immigrant community \u201d \u2013 in an effort to campaign for Marco Rubio \u2019 s amnesty agenda .\nAs House Speaker , Paul Ryan championed a spending bill that would fully fund sanctuary cities , which have resulted in the death and victimization of innocent Americans .\nIn January , 15 criminal illegal aliens were arrested in Paul Ryan \u2019 s home state of Wisconsin . \u201c Their convictions include : homicide by negligent use of a vehicle , strangulation and suffocation , battery , burglary , theft , domestic abuse , drug possession and drunk driving .

He pushes for this at every chance\u2026 The fact that Luis Gutierrez is pushing open borders with Ryan is even more disturbing , \u201d Wilkerson explained .\n\u201c If Paul Ryan becomes the GOP nominee in a brokered convention , you can absolutely be a front row witness to the destruction of the Republican Party , \u201d said Mary Ann Mendoza , whose 32-year-old son Sgt . Brandon Mendoza was murdered by an intoxicated criminal illegal alien who was driving the wrong way down a freeway . At the time of the accident , the criminal alien had a blood alcohol level that was three times the legal limit and had been driving the wrong way for more than 35 miles on four different freeways .\n\u201c This political power that big money has behind the scenes is the exact reason Americans are sick of a corrupt Washington D.C.
