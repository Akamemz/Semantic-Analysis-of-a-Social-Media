    "content": "Both the left and the right have found reasons to celebrate the upset of Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Tuesday 's Virginia primary . The right sees it as a victory for the local grass roots that 's fed up with Washington and a vindication of principled conservative values , particularly on the issue of immigration . ( They were also very upset with Cantor for facilitating the eventual raising of the debt ceiling and failing to repeal Obamacare . ) None of that is all that surprising .\nBut the reaction on the left is more interesting . There was some gloating over the vanquishing of a hated rival , to be sure . And the Democratic Party , having staked its future on the inevitable non-white majority , sees his full-throated criticism of Eric Cantor over immigration to be an advantage , at least in the long term . But on the populist left , there is a sense that Brat signals a sign of an emerging consensus on the left and right on economic issues . This piece by Lee Fang outlines all the areas in which Brat 's anti-corporate welfare rhetoric intersects with left-wing critiques of the power elite and it 's quite interesting . There is little doubt that all these years of economic torpor , high unemployment and rising poverty and debt have opened up some potential paths to bipartisan agreement on these issues around corporate welfare and big money influence in politics .\nBut a closer look at Brat 's rhetoric reveals a man who is not very populist beyond that one issue . He 's a typical libertarian ( albeit with a theological twist ) . And so along with his commitment to end corporate welfare , one would presumably need to take the bitter with the sweet . He thinks it 's unfair that people pay less into Medicare and Social Security than they take out so these programs have to be slashed or eliminated . He believes that Obamacare should be scrapped along with employer-based insurance so that people will buy their own health policies , which will ( he does n't say how ) eliminate the problem of preexisting condition exclusions . He thinks education funding should be drastically cut . He believes that if the country is rich enough it will solve the climate crisis -- - because rich countries always solve their problems .\nHis rhetoric indicates that he fully embraces the principles of the libertarian party agenda , which , yes , says it will abolish corporate welfare :\nAbolish corporate welfare and bailouts : Adopt federal legislation prohibiting any federal spending program that provides payments or unique benefits and advantages to specific companies or industries , terminating programs that provide direct grants to businesses , eliminating programs that provide research and other services for industries and ending programs that provide subsidized loans or insurance to businesses .\nRepeal the income tax : Adopt legislation repealing the income tax and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service . Until the income tax is repealed , adopt legislation preserving the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and enacting across-the-board income tax cuts . Adopt the Balanced Budget Amendment : Adopt a constitutional amendment requiring the federal budget be balanced , and balanced exclusively by cutting expenditures , not by raising taxes .\nAnd how does this ensure greater freedom , security and prosperity ? This piece by a Lew Rockwell contributor describes the coming libertarian utopia . In a nutshell , he explains that by cutting corporate welfare and repealing the income tax along with allowing totally free trade , libertarians will also help the poor because this free economy will liberate them and allow everyone to pursue their economic dreams unfettered by taxes and oppressive government regulations . Millions will start businesses and because the economy will be growing at such a fevered pace , even those losers who have to work for wages will have many more choices . Poverty will virtually disappear because the big problem for poor people is that Wal-Mart is gouging them with high prices due to trade barriers . And if there remain a few unfortunates who are unable to take advantage of the freedom to buy cheap cases of tainted canned cat food ( and I 'm talking about food made from cats not for cats ) directly from China , everyone else will be so rich and feeling so generous that they might throw a few coins their way if they ask very nicely .\nSo , the upshot is that David Brat is against corporate welfare and that is an issue on which progressive populists can find common ground . Perhaps they can work with him and the handful of others in the GOP who feel similarly to craft some reforms to make that happen . But I would n't count on him to be a populist who sees the government as a necessary counterbalance to wealth and power . He 's a fairly doctrinaire libertarian who thinks that wealth and power in the hands of individuals is the best of all possible worlds . If he 's as starry-eyed as many of his fellow true-believers , he also believes everyone can be rich and powerful if only they are n't burdened with taxes and regulations . If you believe that too , there are undoubtedly some libertarian entrepreneurs ready to sell you some cat food .\nInterestingly , the one area where Brat diverges from a standard libertarian POV is the big flagship issue of his campaign : immigration . Libertarians traditionally believe in a loose , if not open , border policy and tend not to be hardcore immigrant bashers . It 's hard to know if Brat has a visceral objection to immigration as so many of his big-name supporters do or whether he genuinely objects simply because Big Business likes it . But he certainly knows how to talk the Tea Party talk :\nLaura Ingraham : Are you a man who would separate a child from her mother or father and is n't that a hard-hearted approach and a way that you 'll never grow the Republican Party or the conservative base . I mean it 's so mean . Brat : You hit it on the head , that is the crux of the issue and Eric Cantor is acting exactly like Obama and the Democrats basing public policy on emotion rather than reason . Just for starters , `` making life work ? '' I mean the day you think the federal government and Caesar should make your life work , you 've got a fundamental problem on your hands and you need to go re-read history books . Whenever you trust the federal government , federal governments do not love , they are incapable of love , so this emotional pitch that Caesar is going to take care of children is just completely irrational . Our founders knew much better . They wanted a contest of 50 states . And on the point you make about the passage of this great founding principle that children should not be punished , does that apply to all children across the globe that they somehow receive a right to be US citizens ? And if that were true , that would mean all future DREAMers have a right to amnesty as every immigration law is bypassed and permanently void if you follow Eric 's logic . I think you referred to it in the news , I know Mark Levin did last night , the Washington Times reported 60,000 kids are expected to cross the border at 225.00 a day per child. , and big business gets the cheap labor that 's what they want , Eric Cantor 's their guy , but who has to pay the 225.00 a day per kids who are coming over the border in what some are calling a humanitarian crisis because Eric Cantor is sending all the wrong signals ? ... He wanted to put illegal immigrants into our military , which makes no sense . You 'll have non-citizens in one of the most key positions in our society , serving in the most honored spot .\nHe dog-whistled the Christian right with all that `` Caesar '' talk , winked at the anti-corporate populists , complained about costs to the taxpayers , genuflected to the military and blamed Eric Cantor for all of it . No wonder he won . He 's good . In fact , he ran a pretty textbook right-wing populist campaign , featuring an attack on `` elites '' ( whom everyone hates these days ) with a thinly veiled nativist appeal to national purity . But underneath it all , he 's more libertarian than anything else .\nThere 's no way of telling which way he 's going to go if he wins the seat in November . He sounds like he 's all things to all people from the populist left to the immigrant-bashing right and everything in between . And that means somebody 's going to be disappointed . Anyone want to take bets on who that 's likely to be ?",
