    "content": "New Delhi , India - In the first week of the new year , police in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand registered a criminal complaint against more than 3,000 people protesting against a new citizenship law , accusing them of `` sedition '' among other charges .\nIndia has seen nationwide protests since mid-December following the passage of Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) that activists and opposition politicians have described as divisive , discriminatory and against the country 's secular constitution . The new law is being challenged in the Supreme Court .\nThe sedition provision , which was drafted by the British colonial rulers in 1870 , comes under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code .\nRights activists say the law has been used to suppress dissent in India particularly against marginalised communities and minorities .\nNationwide protests are taking place across India since December 13 against CAA [ Javed Sultan/ Anadolu ]\nOver the past 18 months , more than 10,000 tribal farmers in mineral-rich Jharkhand state were accused of sedition in 19 police cases for opposing acquisition of lands for so-called developmental projects .\nLaw is not meant to suppress people 's voice , but to create a sense of security among the people . Hemant Soren , Chief Minister of Jharkhand state\nFollowing criticism , Jharkhand 's newly elected Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced the withdrawal of sedition charges slapped by his predecessor belonging to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .\nSoren told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he had asked for an inquiry into why the police used the charge against those who peacefully demonstrated in Wasseypur - a working-class Muslim neighbourhood in Dhanbad district , which was the subject of the 2012 Bollywood hit Gangs of Wasseypur .\n`` Charge of sedition is a serious allegation which needs to be applied with careful scrutiny . In this case , we have asked the officials to drop the charges and provide an explanation . ''\n`` Law is not meant to suppress people 's voice , but to create a sense of security among the people . My government will respect law and protect people , '' said Soren , who comes from the Santhal tribal community .\nSoren government has also dropped charges against more than 10,000 Adivasis slapped by the previous BJP government .\nThe sedition provision punishes anyone seen to `` excite , or attempt to excite feelings of disaffection against the government '' , even though this may be by their words alone . It is a non-bailable offence , and has life imprisonment as the maximum punishment .\nJawahar Raja , a lawyer based in New Delhi , explained that once police add the sedition charge , the maximum quantum of punishment increases , and the courts then view it as a serious offence , making it harder for the accused to secure bail , even if booked only for a speech offence . `` The process of a long-drawn trial then becomes the punishment , '' said Raja .\nAloka Kujur was among the more than 10,000 slapped with sedition cases in Jharkhand . She says `` the police booked her under sedition for a Facebook post in 2018 '' .\nKujur , who publishes magazines on literature and art , said the police issued a warrant to confiscate her property for her post that mentioned the threat to a rape victim .\n`` I faced threats online . The local newspapers started publishing official statements saying that anyone with Marxist and Maoist books will be arrested . I had to give away my small collection of books , as I was unsure what will the police misconstrue against me using this sedition charge , '' she said .\nPolice continue to misuse the provision even though the Supreme Court in 2016 said criticising the government does not amount to sedition [ File : Danish Siddiqui/Reuters ]\nKujur recounts how prosecution lawyers called her `` anti-national '' in the court during her trial .\nIn a similar case , an 83-year-old Jesuit priest , Stan Swamy , who has documented police abuse in tribal areas across the country , was charged with sedition in 2018 for his Facebook posts . One of his posts was a statement by the then home minister calling for dialogue .\nSwamy declined to speak to \u2588\u2588\u2588 as he is facing police case in the western Maharashtra state . His associate Solomon said because of the sedition charge , the elderly activist was forced to stop writing on human rights abuses .\nOur state governments are using colonial-era laws to suppress even peaceful dissent of our own people . Sadaf Jafar , activist\nReferring to the recent sedition cases , a senior Jharkhand police official admitted that the local police acted with excessive hostility against anti-CAA protesters .\n`` I can not comment on use of sedition in previous cases against tribal farmers , but in this instance , the district police action shows a lack of knowledge and a lack of professional competence , '' Anil Palta , additional director general of police ( training ) , Jharkhand , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` If a provision of prevention of assembly of more than four persons , Section 144 is violated , the protesters ought to have been booked under Section 188 , for disobedience , a bailable order . It was very far-fetched of the district police to apply sedition charges . ''\nThe harsh police action against anti-CAA protesters particularly in BJP-ruled states has alarmed rights activists .\nMore than 20 people have been killed in India 's most populous state Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) where some of the initial protests turned violent . Authorities in the state have also said they would seek compensation from protesters for damages to state properties .\nSadaf Jafar , a political activist , was arrested from Lucknow , the capital of UP during anti-CAA protests .\n`` The police arrested me and imprisoned me for 20 days , I was not allowed to inform anyone , '' Jafar told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` We are supposed to be in an elected democracy , but our state governments are using colonial-era laws to suppress even peaceful dissent of our own people .
