    "content": "The financial cards are stacked against women who want but are denied an abortion , as they and their children are more likely to spend years living in poverty than those able to end their pregnancies , a new study suggests . Those compelled to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term are far more likely to experience eviction , bankruptcy and be mired in debt , according to the findings released Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research .\nIn looking at a decade of credit data for women who sought abortions at 30 health providers in 21 states , the latest findings build upon a study released last year that found denied abortions quadrupled the odds of a new mother and her child living in poverty . The new analysis compared changes over time in credit report outcomes for three years before and up to five years after the intended abortion .\n`` We find that being denied an abortion has large and persistent effects on financial distress that are sustained for five years following the intended abortion , '' wrote the report 's authors , Sarah Miller of the University of Michigan , Laura Wheery of the University of California at Los Angeles and Diana Foster of of the University of California at San Francisco . `` Unpaid debts that are more than 30 days past due more than double in size , and the number of public records , which include negative events such as evictions and bankruptcies , increases substantially . ''\nAn inability to afford raising a child was the biggest reason given by women seeking abortions , and for those denied the procedure , public-assistance programs largely failed to compensate for the costs of having a baby and keeping the family out of poverty , the researchers noted .\nTogether , the studies found that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term increased by 78 % the amount of debt 30 days or more past due and increased negative public records like evictions and bankruptcies by 81 % . Women refused abortions were nearly four times as likely to live below the federal poverty line four years later as those who had abortions , according to the research , and three-quarters reported not being able to cover basic expenses , such as housing , transportation and food , five years later . Almost two-third , or 63 % , already had one child .\nThe economic picture illustrated in the research is particularly pertinent in that the decision to end a pregnancy is increasingly being challenged in the U.S. , with at least nine states passing abortion bans in the last year , according to the Center for Reproductive Rights . Should the U.S. Supreme Court limit or overturn Roe v. Wade , abortion rights would be protected in less than half of U.S. states and in none of its territories , the center noted .\nA federal appeals court in December upheld a lower court 's decision striking down Mississippi 's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy . The judge cited Supreme Court decisions dating back nearly five decades to the Roe v. Wade decision re-affirming a woman 's right to end a pregnancy before viability , or when the fetus can survive for a sustained time outside the womb .\nThe Supreme Court in March is hearing its first challenge to Roe v. Wade , the landmark ruling in January 1973 that legalized abortion in the U.S. , since Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the high court in October 2018 .\n`` Given that the current trend has been for state laws to lower gestational limits , with recent efforts to ban abortions as early as six weeks or even through the entire pregnancy , it seems likely that the number of women being denied a wanted abortion in the U.S. will only continue to grow over time , '' the study 's authors concluded .",
