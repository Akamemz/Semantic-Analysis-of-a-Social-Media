The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) -- As Moscow escalates its invasion of eastern Ukraine and NATO convenes this week in Wales, the United States, NATO, and free nations around the world confront a pivotal moment of truth.\n\nIf the international community, led by the United States, fails to respond in a strong and unified manner to Moscow's blatant aggression in Ukraine, the ramifications will be both serious and far-reaching.\n\nBy now, it should be clear to all objective observers that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not impressed by starkly worded statements and declarations, and if that is the only outcome in Wales, it could represent a historic failure of the alliance at a time when NATO's foundational purpose has renewed relevance.\n\nAs NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed last week, Russian forces have \"engaged in direct military operations inside Ukraine,\" including firing on Ukrainian forces from inside Ukraine itself.
