And the administration hopes that is just the beginning .\nDocuments obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show that the administration has also had contact with scores of additional jurisdictions about the program , and 38 of those told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in interviews they have submitted applications for the program or are potentially interested in joining .\nThe program , known as 287 ( g ) , deputizes local officers trained by ICE to use federal records to vet arrestees they suspect of being in the country illegally and then turn them over to federal agents if they are .\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said in the past that police forces taking part in the program have flagged tens of thousands of people for deportation .\nThe broad expansion of the program comes as Trump seeks to accelerate arrests and deportations of people living in the United States illegally . The large number of departments expressing interest in the program has not been previously reported .\nMost of the police departments that have joined , or are seeking to join , the program have relatively small populations , typically fewer than 100,000 residents , with small immigrant populations . In contrast , the roughly three dozen so-called \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d that have limited their cooperation on immigration enforcement have a median population of half a million people and larger foreign-born populations , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis .\nUnder President Barack Obama , the 287 ( g ) program was downsized and its funding reduced amid concerns that some participating police departments were over-zealous in their targeting of Latinos . Critics also said it eroded trust of police in immigrant communities . By the end of fiscal year 2016 only 32 agreements were left in place , down from a peak in 2010 when some 70 jurisdictions were participating . Today , 60 departments in 18 states participate .\nThree-quarters of the agencies that have already signed 287 ( g ) agreements or are interested in doing so are in counties that voted for Trump in 2016 , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of electoral data .\nICE would not confirm which jurisdictions had shown interest until they had signed agreements . An ICE official , who asked not to be named , said interest increased after Trump took office and signed an executive order that included expanding support for the program .\nThe township of Bensalem , Pennsylvania , just half an hour up the road from Philadelphia , is one of those hoping to join the 287 ( g ) program .\nFred Harran , director of public safety in the city of 60,000 , says that any immigrant in the country illegally who commits a crime , even a misdemeanor like shoplifting or possession of a small amount of drugs , should be considered for deportation , and he welcomes help from ICE .\n\u201c If deporting you out of this country when you commit a crime is a tool at my disposal , you are darn right I am going to use it , \u201d Harran said .\nIn neighboring Philadelphia , police commissioner Richard Ross Jr. favors a different approach .
