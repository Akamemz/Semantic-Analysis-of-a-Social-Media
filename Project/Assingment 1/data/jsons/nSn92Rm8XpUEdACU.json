They tell us that the portent for November is obvious and the 2016 election will be shaped by what happened in places like Kentucky and Georgia . What they are far less likely to discuss is what the result of elections mean for people in their real lives .\nThis piece by Corey Robin in the New York Times gives us a hint about what that might be . He talks about a recent study from Gordon Lafer , a political scientist from the University of Oregon who published a paper for the Economic Policy Institute on bills affecting workers all over the country . The bills involved unemployment insurance , sick days , childcare , minimum wage , child labor , collective bargaining , etc . These are meat and potatoes issues for hundreds of millions of Americans . And what he found was that across the board , where Republicans had the power , they passed legislation to roll back workers ' rights and make individual employees weaker in the workplace .\nHere 's a neat trick . Employers are allowed to pay waiters and waitresses less than the federal minimum wage because they get tips . But they are required to pay the non-tipped staffed -- busboys , dishwashers , etc . -- the full minimum wage . Republican lawmakers are getting around this by allowing restaurant owners to force their employees to pool their tips , thereby turning the busboys and dishwashers into tipped workers and allowing owners to pay them below the the minimum wage as well . Everybody loses money -- except the employer . And you 'd better believe they sold this on the basis of being `` fair '' to the non-tipped workers . After all , those waiters and waitresses had been getting the big bucks , right ? Not really : According to Robin `` the poverty rate among waiters and waitresses is 250 percent higher than it is among the general work force . ''\nIn other states they passed laws allowing employers to pocket the tips for themselves , which makes it much simpler all around . And they deserve them , do n't they ? They are the job creators , after all . But what it all adds up to is simple wage theft . Employers are stealing their employees blind .\nWhat was even more astonishing in this report was the evidence of a willingness -- no , eagerness -- by Republicans to use the power of the state to stifle local control . Who would have ever guessed that these staunch supporters of freedom and liberty would take the Big Government hammer to a city or town that does something they think is n't in the interest of Big Business ? Go figure .\nThere are the famous examples of cities enacting a higher minimum wage only to have it struck down by conservative state legislatures . They have done the same with paid sick leave laws throughout the country . And needless to say , the attacks on the unemployed are among the worst . From attempts to mandate drug testing to making them jump through hoops that would daunt a star performer at Cirque du Soleil , the freedom-loving Republicans have implemented state processes so bureaucratic that one can only assume it 's designed to make people hate their government . For instance :\n[ A ] bill sponsored by ALEC members that was passed in 2012 stipulated a series of deadlines at which an unemployed worker would have to start accepting a lower-paying job or lose her unemployment benefits . After 13 weeks , she would have to accept any job paying at least 75 percent of her previous wage ; after 25 weeks , 70 percent ; and after 38 weeks , 65 percent . To ensure compliance with these byzantine regulations ( the red tape Republicans so often claim to oppose ) , the bill required anyone receiving unemployment insurance to submit detailed weekly reports showing that she had applied for at least three jobs per week .
