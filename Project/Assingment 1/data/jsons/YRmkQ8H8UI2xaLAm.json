    "content": "In the fall of 2015 , several artists in the Caribbean appeared in a film titled \u201c 1.5 Stay Alive , \u201d featuring a series of homespun music videos . The name of the project referred to a campaign to limit the rise in average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) above pre-industrial times . Since the 2009 United Nations climate talks , in Copenhagen , the consensus among scientists and policymakers has been that two degrees Celsius should be the limit ; any further temperature increase would be catastrophic . But , for the citizens of small island countries and other vulnerable places in the tropics and the Arctic , even two degrees of warming would be a death sentence . Their communities would be inundated , and eventually destroyed . This could happen by the time the children in the film reached middle age .\nLater that year , at the climate talks in Paris , \u201c 1.5 to Stay Alive \u201d had become a rallying cry for the leaders of the Alliance of Small Island States , which includes countries like the Bahamas , the Maldives , and the Marshall Islands . As a result , the final Paris Agreement declared that , while warming shall not surpass two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels ( the target now commonly cited ) , countries should pursue \u201c efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. \u201d The Alliance of Small Island States also asked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I.P.C.C . ) \u2014the scientific body that informs the climate policies of the United Nations \u2019 member states\u2014to prepare a special report on the specific impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees , along with ways the world could feasibly keep the temperature from rising further . \u201c We needed literature on the conditions of the 1.5-degree world , so this spurred a tremendous amount of new research , \u201d William Solecki , a climate scientist at Hunter College , in New York , and one of the report \u2019 s lead authors , told me . \u201c As soon as the ink was drying on the Paris Agreement , we were off . \u201d\nLast night , in Incheon , South Korea , after a week of deliberation , the I.P.C.C . released the new findings . The summary tells a nightmarish tale\u2014one much worse than any of those in the I.P.C.C. \u2019 s previous reports\u2014surveying the climate-change impacts we \u2019 re already experiencing with one degree of warming , and the severity of the impacts to come once we surpass 1.5 degrees of warming . Ten million more people would be exposed to permanent inundation , and several hundred million more to \u201c climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty. \u201d Malaria and dengue fever will be more widespread , and crops like maize , rice , and wheat will have smaller and smaller yields\u2014particularly in sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , and Central and South America . Security and economic growth will be that much more imperilled . \u201c Robust scientific literature now shows that there are significant differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees , \u201d Adelle Thomas , a geographer from the Bahamas and also one of the report \u2019 s lead authors , told me . \u201c The scientific consensus is really strong . It \u2019 s not just a political slogan : \u2018 1.5 to stay alive. \u2019 It \u2019 s true . \u201d\nThe report marks the start of the I.P.C.C. \u2019 s latest assessment cycle , the sixth since the organization was formed by the U.N . Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization , in 1988 . Its importance is hard to overstate . The thirty-three-page summary for policymakers\u2014which is based on more than six thousand cited studies , and written by ninety-one authors from forty different countries\u2014is a collective scream sieved through the stern , strained language of bureaucratese . Unique ecosystems will vanish and species will go extinct by the thousands . With two degrees of warming , three times as many insects ( eighteen per cent ) , and twice as many plants ( sixteen per cent ) and vertebrates ( eight per cent ) , will lose their geographic range , when compared with warming of 1.5 degrees . Nearly all the coral reefs ( more than ninety-nine per cent ) will be dead , including the Great Barrier Reef , an ecosystem some twenty-five million years old , which is visible from space and is already in severe decline . The global annual catch from marine fisheries will decrease by three million tons . The likelihood of a sea-ice-free Arctic summer will increase from once per century to once per decade . \u201c The next few years are probably the most important in our history , \u201d Debra Roberts , a co-chair of the I.P.C.C . Working Group II , said . ( There are three working groups : one focussed on the physical science of climate change ; the second on impacts , adaptation , and vulnerabilities ; and the third on mitigation . )\nTo keep warming at 1.5 degrees , governments and private businesses must make unprecedented changes\u2014on a sweeping global scale\u2014in energy systems , land management , building efficiency , industrial operations , shipping and aviation , and city-wide design . Within the next decade , human-caused carbon-dioxide emissions need to fall forty-five per cent below 2010 levels . By 2050 , net carbon-dioxide emissions must equal zero . \u201c It \u2019 s a goal that we can aspire to , but maybe not meet , \u201d Jennifer Francis , a climate scientist at Rutgers University who studies Arctic warming and its impacts on global climate , said . \u201c So it \u2019 s useful , even if it isn \u2019 t all that realistic . \u201d\n\u201c Human activities , \u201d the report \u2019 s authors note , have already caused the global mean temperature to increase as much as 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels , with greater warming in certain regions , and particularly in the Arctic . Warming has already led to weather extremes such as heat waves and precipitation of increased intensity and frequency . If warming continues at its current rate , it could reach 1.5 degrees by the time a child who is now a toddler starts high school . The longer countries take to reduce energy consumption and transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind , the more they will have to rely on technologies such as carbon removal , which are currently too expensive , experimental , and small-scale to do the job .\n\u201c You have to think in terms of the survival of human society , \u201d Benjamin Horton , a British geographer who is currently leading the creation of a sea-level-rise adaptation plan for Singapore and who will serve as an editor for a later segment of the I.P.C.C. \u2019 s sixth assessment report , said . \u201c It \u2019 s not only the magnitude of change , it \u2019 s the pace at which it changes , \u201d he said . The rate of sea-level rise accelerates once the West Antarctic Ice Sheet hits its tipping point\u2014likely set to occur somewhere between 1.5 and two degrees of warming , if it hasn \u2019 t occurred already\u2014when physics demands the whole sheet will irreversibly disintegrate . At that point , Horton said , \u201c You can \u2019 t do anything about it . It is very hard to grow an ice sheet , but very easy to melt . \u201d\nAs things stand now , even if every country met the commitment it made in the Paris Agreement , the temperature would still increase to three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century . If the world continues burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate , it could rise by four degrees\u2014a fact that the Trump Administration , which withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement , in June , 2017 , acknowledged with language buried deep in an August draft report issued in support of eliminating Obama-era fuel-economy rules . Representatives from the Trump Administration were in Incheon and had to approve the conclusions of the report . Whether President Trump will respond to its findings remains to be seen . But Adelle Thomas told me that during the draft process , while authors were reviewing more than forty thousand comments submitted by different nations , \u201c there was a real difference between developed countries and non-developed countries. \u201d The former , she said , \u201c wanted to soften the report , and take out anything that specifically mentions island states , challenging why small developing islands should be considered a special case . \u201d\nFor these regions , faster rates of sea-level rise allow much less time to adapt\u2014to restore natural coastal ecosystems and reinforce infrastructure . \u201c Above 1.5 it becomes even more difficult for small islands to plan and recover economically from any damage , \u201d Thomas said . \u201c There are issues of migration and reduced social cohesion after repeated extreme events. \u201d At the U.N. talks in 2010 , rich countries had promised to provide financial support of as much as a hundred billion dollars collectively ( or one per cent of their total G.D.P.s ) , to developing nations by 2020 , to help with the transition to a low-carbon economy and with adapting to climate impacts they already experience . Rich nations have not followed through on that promise ; this year , both the United States and Australia declared that they would no longer be contributing any money at all .\nHeads of state and international leaders will meet in Poland , in December , for the next round of U.N. climate-change talks . They have been given a map of the scale and urgency of the risks that island nations , and the rest of the world , now face , and also specific , feasible pathways to reduced emissions . The science is settled . The only question now is whether the world can find the political\u2014or moral\u2014will to do anything about it . \u201c The report is an assessment of the current scientific understanding , \u201d Solecki , who co-authored the first chapter , told me . \u201c The tone of the report paints a challenging picture , but one that also can be viewed as an opportunity . \u201d",
