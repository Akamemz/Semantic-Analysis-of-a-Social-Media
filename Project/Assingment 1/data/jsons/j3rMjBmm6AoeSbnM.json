This nature of revenge leads to a cycle where each party , once it gains power , will bash down on its rivals .\nDespite Washington \u2019 s warning as he left the presidency , America has had a multiple-party system for almost its entire history . In the country \u2019 s current state , the two main political parties are more polarized than ever , and the current Congress is one of the least effective in our nation \u2019 s history . This is largely because politicians from both parties act more and more along party lines .\nFor our republic to work as it should , we can not discuss politics only among those who agree with us , and we can not simply yell at those with whom we disagree . When we just reaffirm our own beliefs when we talk with people who share our positions , we feel reassured but progress is not made . The problems our country faces will not be remedied by the confirmation our own beliefs . They will not be remedied by shouting matches or name-calling . They will not be remedied when one side is beat into submission . They will be remedied when American citizens , including politicians , listen to the other side of the debate and find compromises .\nNot many politicians will take the time to discuss issues with those who disagree with them , but thankfully that is not always the case . Last September , presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke at Liberty University , a Christian school where many do not hold the same views as him . Both the students and faculty of the school , as well as Sanders , met to try to cross the line drawn by political factions in our modern society .\nIn Sanders \u2019 speech , he noted that , \u201c Too often in our country \u2013 and I think both sides bear responsibility for us \u2013 there is too much shouting at each other \u2026 We go out and we talk to people who agree with us .
