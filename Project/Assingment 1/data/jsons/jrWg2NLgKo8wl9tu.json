    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) In the end , as it always has been with Mitt Romney , it was about the data .\nThree weeks to the day since he informed a group of Republican financiers in New York that he was serious about a third presidential bid , Romney on Friday finally pulled the plug on his long and sometimes agonizing political career , telling supporters that he would not mount a third bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 .\n`` He decided he could be the nominee , '' said Tagg Romney , the oldest of Romney 's five sons . `` The fear was that in order to get there it was going to be so hard fought that he could not emerge from a position of strength . '' The family , he explained , `` all said we would support him , although none of us was looking forward to the process . But no one said we wo n't go through this . ''\nRomney 's decision to forgo a run , made over the weekend in consultation with his family , came on the heels of what associates described as `` frank '' and `` clinical '' strategy session with his closest advisers in Boston last Friday at the offices of Solamere Capital , the financial firm run by Tagg Romney and Spencer Zwick , Romney 's top fundraiser . Romney 's announcement also came two days after David Kochel , one of Romney 's closest confidantes since his days as Massachusetts governor , announced that he would join the likely campaign of Jeb Bush , Romney 's top rival for support in the Republican establishment .\nAt the Boston meeting last week , Romney 's brain trust gave him a clear-eyed assessment of his chances in 2016 , with some aides chiming in via conference call . `` It was n't pandering and persuasion , '' said one person on the call . `` It was , 'Here 's the data . ' ''\nEver since Romney trial-ballooned his campaign at the office of Republican bundler Woody Johnson earlier this month , his donor network had grown lukewarm to the idea , his former staffers had started accepting offers with other potential candidates , and the media consensus about `` Romney 3.0 '' had teetered somewhere between skepticism and ridicule .\nSome of his closest longtime associates , including Boston-based advisers Eric Fehrnstrom and Peter Flaherty , were pushing him to run . His wife Ann was also supportive , sources told CNN , though anxious about putting themselves through the grueling process of a national campaign once again . And one source close to the family says that a donor \u2014 on his own \u2014 did some `` in-depth private polling and the results were shocking '' about how strong Romney was running .\nOthers in his camp expressed wariness of another campaign against a much stronger field than the cast of gadflies , flameouts and polarizing conservatives that Romney faced in 2012 . Romney was told that while his old grassroots supporters and field organizers in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire maintained deep respect for him , they were not enthused about a third campaign .\nPerhaps more frustrating for a businessman who prided himself on the formidable financial network he built in 2012 , Romney learned that Bush , who had jumped into the presidential fray quickly in early January , was quickly siphoning away his support among top donors and was winning the early battle for GOP establishment money . In almost every big donor state , Bush was securing commitments from bundlers who once ponied up for Romney .\nStill , his team , ever loyal to the man they affectionately called `` the Guv , '' were in agreement that they would make it work if he wanted to gas up the Rambler for one more ride .\n`` The takeaway was , there is enough wood here to build a fire , '' said another close Romney adviser who joined the meeting . `` We thought it was was possible . But it would be hard . Last time we had all the winds at our back and this would have been difficult , but absolutely doable . Look , if people like Rick Santorum can get in , then it 's a no brainer that the governor could have done it , and done it well . ''\nSaid the adviser : `` The polls had him up . That was residual name ID . But he ca n't carry that for a year . It would have been a fight . ''\nAt the Friday meeting , aides were given assignments to start pulling together operational plans . Advisers also concluded that it would be smart to launch some kind of political action committee to begin raising money and send a message to donors that his interest was more than just a Hamlet act .\n`` People said , 'We have to get ready to take the next step , ' '' said one adviser . `` If he is not ready to run , we need to announce a committee , because we have to start raising money and sending a message to people . ''\nBut when there was no follow-up from Romney this week , people began to wonder if he might be pulling back . According to Tagg Romney , his father came to the conclusion that he was `` unlikely '' to enter the race that weekend , but wanted to sit on the decision for a few days .\nMany of Romney 's supporters say his decision to opt out by no means takes him out of the race entirely . Longtime Romney adviser Ron Kaufman said that Romney believes `` the best role for him is to help formulate the message and help the winner of the primary process deliver that message . ''\n`` I think he came to the conclusion that while yes , he can win the primary , yes , he can raise the dough , perhaps he can beat Mrs. Clinton , there 's an easier path to winning the presidency if Mitt does n't get involved but stays above it as the most popular Republican in the country , '' Kaufman said .\nBut Jim Merrill , Romney 's top New Hampshire strategist , said the governor had arrived at the conclusion that it was time to step aside and let others take up the party mantle .\n`` I think having run before , he understands how grueling it is . He knows it would be a challenging primary . Knowing what we went through in 2012 , I think he decided it was time for other voices to be heard . ''\nRomney mentioned the need for other voices to be heard in the bowing-out statement he read to supporters on a conference call Friday . But implicit in his words was a critique of Bush , not exactly the new face Romney was describing as his preferred nominee .\n`` I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders , one who may not be as well known as I am today , one who has not yet taken their message across the country , one who is just getting started , may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee , '' Romney said . `` In fact , I expect and hope that to be the case . ''\nRomney and Bush have a cordial relationship but are not close . Romney 's advisers have said that the 2012 nominee is skeptical that the mild-mannered Bush , who last ran for political office almost a decade ago , is ready for the grindhouse of a modern campaign and the media scrutiny that comes with it .\nStill , it was Bush who outmaneuvered Romney in the early stages of the so-called `` invisible primary , '' lining up donors and well-regarded staff talent with haste .
