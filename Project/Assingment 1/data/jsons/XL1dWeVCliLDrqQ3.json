Bush administration tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they will cast a ballot for Clinton over Trump . They are Stephen Krasner , a Stanford University professor who served as the State Department 's director of policy planning from 2005 to 2007 , and David Gordon , a senior advisor at the Eurasia Group who was Krasner \u2019 s successor in that post , which provides strategic thinking .\nAlso saying he would choose Clinton over Trump is Reuel Marc Gerecht , a former CIA case officer and influential neoconservative writer for The Weekly Standard . Gerecht , a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , has been a harsh critic of Obama \u2019 s foreign policy , opposing last summer \u2019 s nuclear deal with Iran and arguing for \u201c war \u201d in Syria .\nBut given a choice between her and Trump , Gerecht said in an email , \u201c I will vote for Clinton . ''\nThose three were among more than 100 Republican foreign policy elites who signed a March open letter opposing Trump on the grounds that he is unqualified to oversee American national security \u2014 a searing concern that Trump has not assuaged with his shifting statements on foreign policy and unfamiliarity with basic issues . In a sign that Trump has largely failed since the end of primary season to win over reluctant critics within his party , at least a dozen of those people now say they expect to cast a ballot for Clinton .\nThat group includes Kenneth Adelman , a former Reagan administration arms control official who was a prominent advocate of the 2003 Iraq war ; Patrick Cronin , a top official with the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) under George W.

( The pro-Clinton positions of Adelman , Levy and Gordon were first reported last week by the Daily Beast . ) Other signatories who have declared for Clinton include the military historian Max Boot ; Kori Schake , a former official at the George W. Bush State Department and National Security Council ; and retired Army Col. Peter Mansoor , a former top aide to General David Petraeus in Iraq , who has said that Trump would be a `` foreign policy disaster for the United States .
