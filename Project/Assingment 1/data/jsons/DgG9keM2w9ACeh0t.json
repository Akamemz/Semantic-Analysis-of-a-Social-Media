    "content_original": "Michael Flynn. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn's son sparred with CNN's Jake Tapper on Twitter over the \"pizzagate\" conspiracy that led an armed man into a Washington, DC, pizza shop Sunday.\n\nFlynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr., vehemently defended the story, which baselessly alleged that a pedophilia ring involving high-level Democratic Party officials \u2014 including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta \u2014 is operating out of a Washington pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong.\n\nFlynn is President-elect Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser.\n\nThe conspiracy led a 28-year-old man to bring an assault rifle to the restaurant on Sunday, police said. They said the gunman was looking to investigate the story himself.\n\n\"Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story,\" Flynn Jr. posted to Twitter. \"The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.\"\n\nThat's when Tapper apparently began to direct message Flynn Jr. on the app, asking for one piece of evidence proving that the pizza shop was \"the site of a satanic pedophilia cult.\" Those direct messages were posted by another user.\n\n\"Michael \u2014 the police called pizza gate a fictitious conspiracy theory tonight,\" Tapper wrote. \"Does someone have to die before you take this s--- seriously.
