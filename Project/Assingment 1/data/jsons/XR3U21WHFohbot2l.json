    "content": "It 's the Obama speech on race you probably have n't heard .\nIn June 2007 , then-Sen. Barack Obama told a mostly black audience of ministers that the country 's leaders `` do n't care about '' New Orleans residents , suggesting the city was neglected in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina because of institutional racism , according to an unedited video reported on by The Daily Caller .\nIn the address , delivered during the upswing of the Democratic presidential primary season , candidate Obama specifically criticizes in outspoken terms the decision not to waive a federal law known as the Stafford Act that requires communities hit by disasters to match 10 percent of federal aid .\n\u201c When 9/11 happened in New York City , they waived the Stafford Act . \u2026 And that was the right thing to do , \u201d he tells the crowd at Hampton University in Virginia . \u201c When Hurricane Andrew struck in Florida , people said , 'Look at this devastation . We do n't expect you to come up with your own money . Here , here 's the money to rebuild . We 're not going wait for you to scratch it together , because you 're part of the American family . ' ``\nObama , echoing rapper Kanye West 's infamous anti-Bush remarks a couple years earlier , then argues that New Orleans was treated differently , suggesting the reason was that the city is mostly black .\n`` What 's happening down in New Orleans ? Where 's your dollar ? Where 's your Stafford Act money ? '' Obama says . `` Makes no sense . ... Tells me that somehow the people down in New Orleans they do n't care about as much . ''\nThe Obama campaign , in response to the resurfacing of the video , noted that the speech was covered in 2007 and claimed the fresh attention was an attempt to change the subject away from Mitt Romney 's own controversial comments about the `` 47 percent '' of Americans who do n't pay taxes .\n`` In a transparent attempt to change the subject from his comments attacking half of the American people , Mitt Romney 's allies recirculated video of a 2007 event that was open to and extensively covered by the press at the time , '' spokesman Ben LaBolt said in a statement . `` The only thing shocking about this is that they apparently think it 's wrong to suggest that we should help returning veterans , children leaving foster care and other members of Mitt Romney 's 47 percent get training that will allow them to find the best available jobs . If the Romney campaign believes that Americans will accept these desperate attacks tonight in place of specific plans for the middle class , it 's they who are in for a surprise . ''\nMedia organizations covered the speech at the time , but the Daily Caller said the video it obtained showed parts of the speech that had never been publicized . It posted what it said was the complete speech on the website .\nBy January 2007 , nearly a year and a half after Hurricane Katrina hit , the federal government had committed $ 110 billion to relief efforts in areas hit by Katrina through a variety of programs , including Community Development Block Grants , funding for the Corps of Engineers and Small Business Administration loans , according to a report that May by the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2019 s Economic and Statistics Administration .\nBut at the time of Obama 's speech , there were still concerns about federal response to the disaster under the Stafford Act , which governs relief efforts . The Federal Emergency Management Agency was unwilling to waive the law \u2019 s 10 percent local match provision for aid , like it did after the Sept. 11 attacks and other hurricanes .\n\u201c One reason cited for FEMA \u2019 s reluctance to waive the 10 percent match in New Orleans is concern about corruption , \u201d the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies said in a 2008 report on the relief efforts .\nThat report also noted that then-Louisiana Gov . Kathleen Blanco was pushing in early 2007 for a federal law eliminating the 10 percent match . The House passed the bill , but it stalled in the Senate and President Bush had threatened to veto it .\nThe complete video of Obama \u2019 s 2007 speech , surfacing barely a month before the presidential election and the night before Obama \u2019 s first debate with Romney , could complicate Obama \u2019 s efforts to avoid a politically risky debate over race that partly ensnared him during the 2008 race . Four years ago , his fiery pastor , the Rev . Jeremiah Wright , became a political liability over videos that showed Wright making controversial statements .\nObama , after initially defending him , eventually was forced to condemn Wright publicly , and the controversy prompted Obama to deliver his much-heralded 2008 address on race in Philadelphia .\nWright reportedly attended the 2007 speech , and in the video obtained by the Daily Caller , Obama is heard calling Wright `` my pastor , the guy who puts up with me , counsels me , listens to my wife complain about me . He 's a friend and a great leader . Not just in Chicago , but all across the country . ''\nThe Daily Caller also highlighted a segment in which Obama questions federal priorities in transportation spending .\n`` We need additional federal public transportation dollars flowing to the highest-need communities . We don \u2019 t need to build more highways out in the suburbs . If we have people in the cities right now who want to work but have no way to get into those jobs , we 've got to help connect them to the jobs that exist , \u201d Obama said . \u201c We should be investing in minority-owned businesses , in our neighborhoods , so people don \u2019 t have to travel from miles away . \u201d",
