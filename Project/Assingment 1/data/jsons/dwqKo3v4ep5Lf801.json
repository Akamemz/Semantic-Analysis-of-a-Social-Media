''\n`` The battle for the heart and soul of HP was very long and bitter and personally impactful , '' said Steve Huhn , a former vice president of global sales at HP .\nFollowing the latest Fiorina news has become a bit of a hobby for some HP alums .\nAbout a half dozen ex-employees who previously worked in the Palo Alto , California , headquarters have been exchanging some lively emails in recent weeks to discuss Fiorina 's presidential prospects . The contents of the emails were shared with CNN by multiple participants on the condition that they not be named .\n`` I said when Carly was mentioned as a possible running mate with John McCain , he 's a war hero and former POW . I think he 's suffered enough already , '' one person wrote .\n`` She loves the big stage and has no fear of saying whatever it takes to win the moment , '' another email said .\nAll the talk comes after Fiorina said earlier this month that the likelihood she 'll run for president is `` way over 50 % .
