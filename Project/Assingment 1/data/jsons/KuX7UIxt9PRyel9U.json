One of those proverbial pachyderms was present courtesy of the aspiring Supreme Court justice .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an elephant in the room with us today , \u201d Judge Gorsuch wrote in a 2016 concurrence that featured prominently in 11 hours of questioning Tuesday from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .\nThe \u201c elephant \u201d Gorsuch was trying to draw wider attention to is a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference . Basically , a Supreme Court decision from 1984 states that , as long as a federal agency \u2019 s interpretation of a law passed by Congress is reasonable , courts should allow it \u2013 which tips the balance toward the executive branch of government .\nWith executive power now being challenged in the courts like never in living memory , many in the legal community think the \u201c behemoth \u201d of Chevron deference , as Gorsuch described it , should be revisited and revised as well . And that \u2019 s in no small part because of Gorsuch \u2019 s own comments while serving on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals .\n\u201c Gorsuch is one of the most prominent , if not THE most prominent , lower court judges calling for a rethinking of Chevron , \u201d wrote Ilya Somin , a professor at George Mason University \u2019 s Antonin Scalia School of Law , in an email to the Monitor . \u201c His position is still a minority view . But the minority is growing . \u201d\nWhile scaling back Chevron would certainly affect agencies , it could also have significant repercussions for President Donald Trump , who not only nominated executive power skeptic Gorsuch , but who has also continued to push the envelope of executive power himself .\n\u201c Executive power issues are the most important that the [ Supreme ] Court will face in the next decade , \u201d wrote Ernest Young , a professor at Duke University Law School , in an email to the Monitor . \u201c The Executive must abide by statutory limits set by Congress , but if the Executive gets to define those limits ( and courts have to defer to its definitions ) then those limits are a lot less meaningful . \u201d\nPut more bluntly by Professor Somin : \u201c Eliminating Chevron would help curb the dangerous expansion of executive power . It \u2019 s particularly desirable if you believe Trump and/or some other likely administration poses an unusually serious threat to the rule of law . \u201d\nIn the three decades since the Chevron ruling , courts have grown even more willing to defer to agency expertise and the notion that executive agencies are more politically accountable than the judiciary . Simultaneously , the overall power of the executive branch has been steadily expanding .\n\u201c When an agency can overrule a judge on the law , that \u2019 s a separation of powers issue I think , maybe even an equal protection issue , \u201d Gorsuch said Tuesday during his hearings . \u201c I defer to experts when it comes to facts , but when it comes to questions of law , [ the Administrative Procedures Act ] entrusts courts to say what is the law . \u201d\nDefenders of Chevron argue that deference to agencies is necessary because of their institutional expertise . They also argue that , for the government to run efficiently and effectively , agencies can \u2019 t be required to get court approval for every interpretation or reinterpretation of a law .\nChevron \u2019 s scope has become vast and complex , however , and criticisms of it are equally complex .\nTo which agency actions should Chevron deference apply , for example ? The 1984 Supreme Court case \u2013 involving Gorsuch \u2019 s mother , Anne , who was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Reagan \u2013 concerned how the US Environmental Protection Agency should interpret a \u201c source of pollution \u201d to be regulated by the Clean Air Act . The justices ruled that courts should defer to the EPA interpretation instead of crafting one itself .\nBut should a court show equal deference to the actions of a low-level IRS employee responding to a minor concern ? And does the agency interpretation deserve deference immediately ? Or only after it has been in effect after a certain amount of time ?\nEven the more liberal members of the Supreme Court have these kinds of nuanced concerns , says Professor Young .\n\u201c Justice [ Stephen ] Breyer is generally a strong supporter of agencies but \u2013 as a lifelong [ Administrative ] Law professor ( he taught it to me back in 1992 ) \u2013 his views are very complex and there are situations where he would limit agencies significantly , \u201d he adds . \u201c Likewise , Justice Kagan is also an Ad Law professor in her former life and has complicated views . I don \u2019 t think this will turn out to be a left-right issue on the Court . \u201d\nHowever , how people outside the court tend to view it does tend to be influenced by where they sit on the political spectrum .\n\u201c People on the right have become skeptical of bureaucrats \u2019 claims to expertise because they perceive bureaucratic power as being exercised in overtly political ways , \u201d wrote Young . \u201c People on the left accuse the right of rejecting \u2018 science \u2019 outright . \u201d\nThe Gorsuch hearings have given the Chevron debate the exposure Gorsuch himself may have only once dreamed of , but it has done so through a distinctly partisan lens that belies the complexity of the issue .\n\u201c Reexamining Chevron is not about being anti- or pro-regulation . It 's about restoring constitutional separation of powers . It 's about ensuring that bureaucracy abides by the law no matter what its policy goals , \u201d said Senator Orrin Hatch ( R ) of Utah . \u201c This deference allows unaccountable bureaucrats to rewrite the law . \u201d\nDemocrats on the committee have voiced the concern that abandoning Chevron due to fear of the latter could result in the courts disregarding agency expertise .\n\u201c Judicial action is often after the fact and backwards-looking , and regulation needs to keep up with the times , \u201d says Sen.

As for the legislature , \u201c unless Congress is going to start passing 5,000-page bills , we \u2019 re not going to have the time or competency to do [ the technical work of agencies ] in statute . \u201d\nDuring Tuesday \u2019 s hearing , Sen.
