They skipped over body cameras . They skipped over racial bias training .\nThey did recommend the creation of another task force , this one called the National Crime and Justice Task Force .\nSince then , Walter Scott was shot five times in the back by a police officer in North Charleston , S.C. , and Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries he didn \u2019 t have before he was taken into custody by the police in Baltimore , which burst into riots and looting Monday , right in the middle of the day .\nWith a dozen incidents in a year and a half , all around the country , the frustrations appear to transcend local conditions .
