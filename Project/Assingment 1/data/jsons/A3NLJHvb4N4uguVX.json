The legislation gutted many of the progressive voting rules that had contributed to Obama \u2019 s razor-thin margin in the state : same-day registration , a lengthy early voting period and out-of-precinct voting by provisional ballot \u2013 all favored disproportionately by African American voters and students . The law also introduced a strict voter ID requirement , with the anticipated effect of suppressing Democratic votes even further .\nHad the law stood , it could have been the biggest setback for voting rights in North Carolina since the Jim Crow era , a brazen attempt by conservatives to upend the rules of democratic engagement and block access to groups most likely to oppose them . The Republicans have sought to couch their maneuvering in more benign terms , as a form of justifiable partisan warfare . Hawke noted in his postmortem that the Democrats had been motivated , united and well-financed in 2008 , and said it was up to the Republicans to respond in kind .\nThat argument has come crashing down , following a flurry of remarkable court rulings over the past two weeks accusing North Carolina and three other Republican-run states \u2013 Wisconsin , Kansas and Texas \u2013 of violating the 1965 Voting Rights Act and intentionally discriminating against African Americans and other classes of voters . State and federal judges have struck down laws that could have given the Republicans a significant edge in close races this November , lifting the spirits of voting rights activists who have been campaigning against such laws for more than a decade .\nWinning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination Fourth circuit court of appeals ruling\n\u201c Winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination , \u201d the fourth circuit court of appeals ruled in the North Carolina case on Friday . \u201c When a legislature dominated by one party has dismantled barriers to African American access to the franchise , even if done to gain votes , \u2018 politics as usual \u2019 does not allow a legislature dominated by the other party to re-erect those barriers . \u201d\nThe omnibus law has been almost entirely swept away and is now unlikely to be resurrected in any form before November , when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be fighting over every vote in North Carolina , where recent polls show them less than two points apart .\nIn Kansas , which is not a swing state , a state court pushed back against an attempt by the state \u2019 s top Republican elections official , Kris Kobach , to prevent an estimated 17,500 Kansans from voting in state and local races even though they have been recognized as eligible by federal courts . They will now be allowed to participate fully in primary elections this Tuesday .\nIn Texas , also not a swing state , a federal appeals court has ordered the state government to find a remedy for eligible voters unable to comply with the country \u2019 s single most restrictive and blatantly partisan voter ID law \u2013 a law recognizing concealed-carry weapons permits as valid ID but not student cards from state universities .\nAnd in Wisconsin , which is a swing state , the federal courts have delivered a double rebuke to Governor Scott Walker and his contention that one of the country \u2019 s most efficiently run election systems was in need of a major overhaul . One federal judge ruled last week that eligible voters unable to meet the requirements of the state \u2019 s voter ID law could instead produce an affidavit attesting to their identity . On Friday , a different federal judge struck down much of Wisconsin \u2019 s version of the North Carolina omnibus law \u2013 a 2013 act that restricted early voting , extended the residency requirement for new voters and denied provisional voters the chance to vote out of precinct .\n\u201c The legislature \u2019 s immediate goal was to achieve a partisan objective , \u201d Judge James Peterson charged in a blistering ruling , \u201c but the means of achieving that objective was to suppress the reliably Democratic vote of Milwaukee \u2019 s African Americans . \u201d\nHow the supreme court 's tilt to the left rests on conservative Anthony Kennedy Read more\nTaken together , these rulings represent a stunning rejection of more than a decade of Republican strategy in states where the party has taken control of the legislature , the governor \u2019 s mansion or both .\n\u201c The tide is turning against the proponents of voter suppression across our country , \u201d longtime voting rights activist Kirsten Clarke , of the Lawyers \u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , said in a statement . \u201c It is time for elected officials to see the writing on the wall and abandon efforts to lock Americans out of the ballot box . \u201d\nBob Phillips of Common Cause North Carolina was similarly jubilant . \u201c This is a big win , \u201d he said after the fourth circuit ruling . \u201c It affirms that democracy is for everyone . \u201d\nRepublican leaders were either too stunned to offer an immediate response , or else accused \u201c activist \u201d judges of making an incorrect interpretation of the law .
