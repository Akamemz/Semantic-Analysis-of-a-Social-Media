    "content": "The Sudanese military has ousted president Omar al-Bashir in an apparent coup , following months of intense anti-government protests against the long-serving dictator .\nGen. Awad Ibn Auf , Sudan \u2019 s defense minister and former vice president , announced al-Bashir \u2019 s overthrow on Thursday , telling the country al-Bashir had been arrested and that his regime had been toppled .\nIbn Auf also declared that the constitution would be suspended and the military would take control during a two-year transition period . He announced a three-month national emergency ( though al-Bashir had already instituted year-long national emergency in February ) and imposed a 10 pm curfew .\nThe removal of al-Bashir is a stunning development . The authoritarian leader took over in a coup in 1989 , and has maintained his grip on power for 30 years despite international pressure over Sudan \u2019 s support of terrorism and perpetration of genocide in the Darfur region . He is wanted by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) on charges of war crimes and other atrocities .\nAl-Bashir also oversaw a long-running civil war between north and south Sudan , which ended in a peace agreement in 2005 and eventually led to the break-up of his country with the independence of South Sudan , in 2011 .\nBut the military \u2019 s announcement that it plans to retain control has dampened the historic end of al-Bashir \u2019 s rule , as protesters fear this is a continuation of the regime , rather than a move toward democracy and a civilian-led government that they have been demanding for months .\n\u201c For many , it \u2019 s an in-house handover , or coup , rather than a genuine change that the people have actually been demonstrating for , \u201d Bashair Ahmed , a doctoral researcher at Sussex University and director of Shabaka , an African and Middle Eastern diaspora advocacy group , told me .\nThe situation in Sudan is in flux . The Sudanese Professionals Association , which mobilized the protests , has said demonstrations will continue to until civilian leadership takes over .\nBut al-Bashir \u2019 s defeat is significant , and it comes just a few weeks after another long-serving ruler , this time in Algeria , agreed to step down amid widespread protests . The ousting of entrenched leaders in Algeria and Sudan just a few weeks apart has strong echoes of the uprisings of the Arab Spring in 2011 .\nAnd now , as then , both promise and peril lie ahead .\nAl-Bashir took power in a military coup in 1989 , and his three decades of control has been defined by corruption and brutal violence . He ruled during decades-long civil war against an insurgency in the southern part of the country , which ended in 2005 with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) .\nBut just as the conflict with South Sudan was ending ( the region would eventually vote for independence , a provision of the peace agreement , and become its own sovereign country ) , al-Bashir faced another insurgency , this time in the Darfur region in western Sudan .\nTo fight that insurgency , he relied on pro-government militias \u2014 known collectively as the \u201c Janjaweed \u201d \u2014 who carried out heinous atrocities , burning villages , murdering civilians . ( UN estimates say about 300,000 people were killed . ) Al-Bashir was charged by the ICC for overseeing the genocide in Darfur , effectively making him persona non grata on the international stage .\nNot that he wasn \u2019 t before . Sudan has been classified as a state sponsor of terror by the US State Department since 1993 , after Sudanese government officials were found to have been directly involved in the planning and logistics of the deadly World Trade Center bombing earlier that year . Throughout the early 1990s , the al-Bashir government hosted a who \u2019 s who of terrorist groups , including al-Qaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah , and others .\nThat has gradually changed , and the al-Bashir government has cooperated with the US on counterterrorism efforts for several years now . In 2017 , the Trump administration lifted some sanctions on the country as part of a rapprochement with Sudan \u2019 s government that began in the Obama administration .\nHowever , the country remains designated as a state sponsor of terror by the State Department , and sanctions related to the genocide in Darfur remain in place .\nProtests have broken out against al-Bashir several times in previous years , including in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring . Major demonstrations also took place in 2013 , and even in at the start of 2018 . But those protests were primarily centered in the capital of Khartoum and were met with fierce government crackdowns .\nThis most recent uprising erupted in December 2018 after al-Bashir ended government wheat and fuel subsidies , causing a spike in food prices and gas shortages . But the demonstrations quickly turned into an outlet for people \u2019 s broader frustration and fury with al-Bashir himself .\nAnd what began as breakout demonstrations became a more organized political movement , led by middle-class professionals , such as doctors and lawyers , and students . The Sudanese Professional Association , a trade organization representing those and other professions , is one of the main forces behind the current protests .\nSocial media also helped ignite the movement , allowing activists to connect and circumvent the state-controlled media . Access to Facebook , WhatsApp , and Twitter has brought young people out on the streets in large numbers .\nWomen , too \u2014 who face restrictions on where they can go and how they can dress in Sudan \u2014 have been drivers of the movement . \u201c It \u2019 s a revolution being led by the very people being born and raised under [ al-Bashir ] \u2014 they \u2019 ve known no other president , \u201d Ahmed said .\nAl-Bashir tried to crack down on the protests in February , instating a year-long state of emergency that only intensified demonstrations against his government . Clashes between Sudanese security forces and protests have killed dozens since December .\nThe latest round of protests began on April 6 , on the anniversary of a 1985 coup that removed President Jaafar Nimeiri from power . Protesters rallied and staged a sit-in outside the presidential palace and in front of the military headquarters in Khartoum .\nThe demonstrations continued unabated . Security forces tried to dislodge protesters earlier in the week , firing tear gas and bullets into the crowds . But army soldiers reportedly protected and defended the protesters against some of these attacks , a sign that al-Bashir \u2019 s hold on power was becoming more tenuous .\nAnd on Thursday , a major victory : Sudanese military announced al-Bashir \u2019 s arrest \u2014 and thus the end of his decades of rule . The announcement was met with celebrations , and political detainees and protesters who had been held by the government were released .\nBut some of that jubilation was tamped down by the suddenly uncertain future for Sudan \u2014 and doubt about whether a change in leader goes far enough .\n\u201c What people want on the ground is for the whole system to change , \u201d Amal Muntaser , a student and activist from Khartoum who \u2019 s currently in studying in Italy , told me . \u201c Because it \u2019 s not just the president that has been part of the problem . It \u2019 s the whole regime . \u201d\nThe Sudanese military told the public it had arrested al-Bashir , and that his regime was over .
