    "content": "Senate Republicans took initial steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act Tuesday , using a process called budget reconciliation to start the process of gutting some of the health care law \u2019 s major provisions .\nUpdate : Watch interview with President Obama on the future of Obamacare\nThe budget reconciliation process is complex , and not the normal way that Congress passes laws . It is a three-step process that starts with a budget resolution \u2014 essentially a list of spending targets for the coming years \u2014 and a set of instructions for how committees can hit those targets ( in this case , by repealing Obamacare ) .\nThe reconciliation process constrains how much of Obamacare Republicans can dismantle ; any changes they make need to affect the federal budget . Still , this allows them to attack some of the biggest parts of the Affordable Care Act , like tax credits for middle-income Americans to purchase coverage and the expansion of Medicaid to low-income Americans .\nThe reconciliation process is messy , and it \u2019 s constrained . But Republicans will use this more complex process because it has one big advantage : Legislation passed through the budget reconciliation process can not be filibustered . So instead of coming up with a 60-vote majority , Republicans only need 51 votes to pass a reconciliation bill for repeal .\nThe whole process promises to be complex \u2014 so I called up Sarah Binder , an expert on congressional procedure at George Washington University , and had her explain it to me . We talked through the exact steps involved in budget reconciliation , how long it might take , and what obstacles Republicans could face . What follows is a transcript of our discussion , lightly edited for length and clarity .\nI understand that Republicans can use the budget reconciliation process to repeal big chunks of the Affordable Care Act that affect the budget , like the tax credits or the Medicaid expansion . What I don \u2019 t understand is , logistically , how that works . Can you walk me through the budget reconciliation process ?\nTo understand reconciliation , we have to go two steps back . We have to start with the general congressional budget process .\nAll of it is under the umbrella of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the process it set up . The Budget Act sets up a requirement that Congress pass a budget resolution , which is the first and necessary step if you want to go to reconciliation .\nA budget resolution is not law . It \u2019 s just a blueprint that the House and Senate adopt that sets out target levels of spending for different areas . You need the budget resolution because it provides the guidance for future appropriations bills for how much can be spent .\nThe budget resolution can include instructions to different committees . It comes out of the House and Senate Budget committees , and it can essentially say , \u201c In order to hit these targets , we need you to come up with the savings on your turf. \u201d When you \u2019 re talking about a reconciliation bill for health care , we \u2019 re talking about turning to committees like Senate Finance and Senate HELP [ Health , Education , Labor , and Pension ] .\nThe reconciliation bill essentially tells these committees , \u201c It \u2019 s time to do your part now , and send us some language on how you \u2019 re going to meet these targets. \u201d And then the budget will be created to include those changes .\nSo is it called reconciliation because the budget committee is essentially asking the other committees to reconcile the spending levels they want with actual policy ?\nNot really . The reason it \u2019 s called reconciliation is the original 1974 bill had Congress passing not one budget , but two . The second was essentially to clean up the first budget .

The resolution gives the instructions , and then after that happens you end up with an actual reconciliation bill .\nI think what is taking time is that even though they have that bill on the shelf from 2015 , this is a moment of reckoning .

You have Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) who wants to replace Obamacare at the same time as repeal , and Republicans certainly aren \u2019 t anywhere near that .
