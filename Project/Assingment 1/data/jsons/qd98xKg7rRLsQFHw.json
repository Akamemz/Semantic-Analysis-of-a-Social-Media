That is 22 days of unfathomable cruelty to vulnerable girls , and 22 days of panicked parents wondering about the fate of their daughters \u2013 and whether an education could possibly be worth such a price , and why the international community has not vocally condemned the treacherous act .\nThat the United States and other nations are stepping forward with offers of assistance is welcomed , but the fact that such action came after more than three weeks , and in response to great pressure and international outrage , raises a fundamental question : What , morally , does the United States stand for ?\nIt is naive to ignore the mounting evidence that , beyond considering its own strategic and national self-interest , the United States does not have an operating philosophy when it comes to defending human rights . Its decision to remain silent after Egypt \u2019 s democratically elected president was overthrown in a coup last year and its long-standing engagement with countries like Saudi Arabia , whose cultural ethos/philosophy in many respects runs counter to American beliefs , underscore the schism between what America claims to stand for and what it actually does in practice .\nIndeed , these choices are a far cry from America the brand \u2013 the moral torchbearer and defender of human rights , of fairness and justice , and above all , of what is good and decent .
