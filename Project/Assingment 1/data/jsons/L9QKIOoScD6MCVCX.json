A recall effort has begun against state Sen. Richard Pan , a Democrat and pediatrician who sponsored S.B . 277 , along with a referendum campaign to repeal the bill .\n\u201c They have awoken a sleeping giant that is not going away and is only going to get bigger , \u201d said Christina Hildebrand , a Bay Area resident who founded A Voice for Choice to fight mandatory vaccinations .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the one thing I would say is the silver lining of all this : They don \u2019 t know what they \u2019 ve just done , \u201d she said . \u201c The people have woken up . \u201d\nMore than 100 bills were introduced in 36 state legislatures after a January measles outbreak at Disneyland . Nearly all of them fizzled \u2014 except in California .\nDespite rallies and hearings packed with opponents of mandatory vaccination , Gov . Jerry Brown , a Democrat , signed S.B . 277 shortly after it hit his desk Tuesday .\nLater that day , the Assembly Health Committee approved a bill , S.B . 792 , to require day care and preschool workers to be vaccinated against a number of diseases , including the flu , as a condition of employment . A day later , Assembly Bill 1117 , which gives incentives to doctors to vaccinate Medi-Cal patients , sailed through the Senate Health Committee on a 6-1 vote .\nThe passage of those bills , coupled with S.B . 277 , would give California the toughest vaccination requirements in the nation .\n\u201c One child \u2019 s death is one too many , especially when it may be preventable , \u201d state Sen. Tony Mendoza , a Democrat who introduced S.B . 792 , said in a statement . \u201c With the recent deadly outbreaks of measles and influenza , we must do everything in our power to protect California \u2019 s children who spend time in day care . \u201d\nThe Democrats have plenty of support behind their vaccine push , including from the California Medical Association , public health groups , school districts and labor unions . Proponents argue that use of the personal belief exemption has put at risk \u201c herd immunity \u201d in some areas where vaccines are unpopular .\n\u201c Years of anti-science , anti-vaccine misinformation have taken its toll on immunization rates to the point that the public is now [ in ] danger , \u201d Mr. Pan said in a recent statement .\nHe pointed to a Public Policy Institute of California poll released last month that showed 67 percent said children should be vaccinated before attending public school . The poll didn \u2019 t ask about private school , although S.B . 277 also requires vaccines for children entering private schools .\nSupporters of the vaccination bills have tried to dismiss foes as anti-government conservatives , but the loosely organized coalition is nothing if not politically diverse . Along with Republicans leery of government overreach are Santa Monica and Marin County liberals who view skeptically the pharmaceutical industry and the chemicals used in some vaccines , such as mercury and aluminum .\nThen there \u2019 s the Hollywood wing . Actor Jim Carrey drew headlines and criticism this week with a Twitter photo of a boy with autism and the message , \u201c A trillion dollars buys a lot of expert opinions . Will it buy you ? Toxin free vaccines , a reasonable request ! \u201d the last sentence bellowed out in all capital letters .\nTerry Roark , an East Bay volunteer with the National Vaccine Information Center , said Democrats have alienated a segment of the voting base by pushing mandatory vaccines while calling for individual choice on other health issues , starting with abortion .\n\u201c The California Democratic Party had their convention in Anaheim a month or so ago and passed a resolution that said that the party would support all vaccine-mandate bills , \u201d Ms. Roark said . \u201c People are leaving the party in droves .\n\u201c Some people say , \u2018 Hey , you have to stay in the party and work within the party to change the party , \u2019 and other people say , \u2018 Nah , screw \u2018 em , \u2019 \u201d she said . \u201c They \u2019 ll give me a choice if I want to carry a baby or abort , but once that baby is born , the woman no longer has any rights to choose what gets injected into the kid ? Come on , now . Something \u2019 s wrong with that picture . \u201d\nAmong the legislation \u2019 s foes are those who have no problem with vaccines but resent the government intrusion . Former Assembly member Tim Donnelly on Wednesday launched the referendum on S.B . 277 over the issue of government mandates on health care .\n\u201c This referendum is not about vaccinations ; it is about defending the fundamental freedom of a parent to make an informed decision for their children without being unduly penalized by a government that believes it knows best , \u201d said Mr. Donnelly , a talk show host on Radio Free California .\nMr. Donnelly , who placed third in the state \u2019 s 2014 open gubernatorial primary , said Mr. Brown \u201c signed away a parent \u2019 s right to choose what \u2019 s best for their children . \u201d\n\u201c This is a victory for leftists bent on absolute control .
