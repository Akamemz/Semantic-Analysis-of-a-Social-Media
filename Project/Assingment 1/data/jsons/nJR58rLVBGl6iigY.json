Why the W.H . went all-in on Hagel\nPresident Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have fiercely defended the nomination of Chuck Hagel , despite advisers and Hill Democrats who questioned the move and predicted a firestorm , according to Democratic sources .\nThat opinion was validated , at least for the moment , by events Thursday as Senate Republicans narrowly blocked cloture on Hagel \u2019 s nomination . Obama immediately slammed the filibuster \u2014 which could be broken after a 10-day congressional recess .\nBut an irked Obama is dead set on installing his pick at the Pentagon \u2014 even though the bitter battle over his confirmation is likely to leave lasting scars on his nominee at a time of looming military cuts and dangerous new developments in Iran and North Korea .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve never had a secretary of defense filibustered before \u2026 there are only a handful of instances in which there \u2019 s been any kind of filibuster of anybody , \u201d the president said during a Google+ chat after the Senate vote .\n\u201c My expectation and hope is that Chuck Hagel \u2026 will be confirmed as our defense secretary , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s just unfortunate that this kind of politics intrudes at a time when I \u2019 m presiding over [ a war in Afghanistan ] .\nSenior White House officials predicted that a battered Hagel would manage to limp over the finish line and take the job of defense secretary later this month . But others pointed to the cost after weeks of absorbing criticism about his previous statements on Israel , his personal finances and unanswered questions about Obama \u2019 s personal response to the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attacks in Benghazi , Libya .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to put him in a difficult position once he gets there , \u201d said Bill Cohen , a former Republican senator from Maine who served as defense secretary under President Bill Clinton . \u201c I \u2019 m sure there will be some lingering discontent on the part of some on the Hill .
