A judge was expected to hear the case on Wednesday morning if schools had not reopened .\nBut to union leaders , the legal filing was only the latest example of Mr. Emanuel \u2019 s \u201c bullying behavior , \u201d said a union spokeswoman , Stephanie Gadlin , who described the injunction as a \u201c vindictive act instigated by the mayor . \u201d\nGary N. Chaison , professor of industrial relations at Clark University , described Mr. Emanuel \u2019 s decision to take the matter to court now as \u201c a declaration of war , \u201d adding , \u201c I don \u2019 t think the mayor understands that the goal of negotiating is to get an agreement , not to win . \u201d\nIf teachers continue the strike beyond Tuesday , they risk losing support from students \u2019 families , many of whom expressed patience in the first week of the strike but were sounding increasingly exasperated heading into Week 2 . Fading union support would potentially benefit Mr. Emanuel , political observers here said , but all agreed that no one would win politically if the strike dragged on .\nMr. Emanuel has his enthusiastic backers in his push for more days and hours in school and for teacher evaluations that consider student test scores , but unions beyond those that represent teachers are irked at Mr. Emanuel \u2019 s aggressive handling of the situation . The anger is personal , not aimed generically at some school board or City Hall but squarely at him .
