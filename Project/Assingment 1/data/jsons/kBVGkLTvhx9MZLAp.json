    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : The Ninth U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Tuesday on whether to restore President Donald Trump \u2019 s executive order banning people from Iraq , Syria , Iran , Sudan , Libya , Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States . The case was brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota . The emergency hearing came just days after a judge in Seattle imposed a nationwide temporary restraining order on the ban . On Tuesday , three judges on the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments via telephone . Two of the judges were appointed by Democrats\u2014William Canby and Michelle Friedland\u2014and one by a Republican\u2014Richard Clifton . Justice Department lawyer August Flentje argued Trump \u2019 s executive order was constitutional .\nAUGUST FLENTJE : Under Section 212 ( f ) , Congress has expressly authorized the president to suspend entry of classes of aliens when it is\u2014when it is necessary or when otherwise it would be detrimental to the interests of the United States . That \u2019 s what the president did here . And the president \u2019 s determination that a 90-day pause was needed for the seven countries at issue here in order to ensure adequate standards\u2014and that \u2019 s language from the order\u2014for visa screening was plainly constitutional . The district court \u2019 s order , which contained no assessment of the legality of the order , was in error , and we encourage the court to stay .\nAMY GOODMAN : During his argument , the Justice Department lawyer , August Flentje , questioned the role of the court in reviewing the president \u2019 s actions .\nAUGUST FLENTJE : The reason we sought immediate relief and a stay is because of the court \u2019 s\u2014the district court \u2019 s decision overrides the president \u2019 s national security judgment about the level of risk . And we \u2019 ve been talking about the level of risk that is acceptable . As soon as we are having that discussion , it should be acknowledged that the president is the official that is charged with making those judgments . I \u2019 d also like to talk briefly\u2014\nJUDGE MICHELLE FRIEDLAND : So , are we back to\u2014I mean , are you arguing then that the president \u2019 s decision in that regard is unreviewable ?\nAMY GOODMAN : Noah Purcell , the solicitor general for the state of Washington , said it was the court \u2019 s role to serve as a check on the executive branch .\nSOLICITOR GENERAL NOAH PURCELL : It has always been the judicial branch \u2019 s role to say what the law is and to serve as a check on abuses by the executive branch . That judicial role has never been more important in recent memory than it is today . But the president is asking this court to abdicate that role here , to reinstate the executive order without meaningful judicial review and to throw this country back into chaos .\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the legal fight against Donald Trump \u2019 s executive order , we \u2019 re joined by Lee Gelernt . He is an ACLU attorney who presented the first challenge to Trump \u2019 s executive order on immigration . His argument resulted in a nationwide injunction .\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you make of the court hearing yesterday ?\nLEE GELERNT : You know , they were well prepared . I would say , listening to it , it \u2019 s always difficult , you know , to predict what a court will do , but they gave\u2014I think they asked very pointed , tough questions of the U.S. government , and , in particular , sort of wanted to know : Could they review this ? Because I think that \u2019 s the sort of takeaway from all this . Is the administration saying that the courts have no role ? Because if the courts have no role , we \u2019 re in a dangerous situation . And so , I think they properly pressed the U.S. government : What \u2019 s our role ? And are you really saying there \u2019 s no role here ? And I think\u2014\nLEE GELERNT : Right . And so , that they can review what the president did . There \u2019 s no question that the president and Congress are entitled to some deference when they act in this area . But the U.S. government is coming dangerously close to saying , \u201c If the president says it \u2019 s OK , then it \u2019 s OK. \u201d And I think what you \u2019 ve seen from the panel last night , but also from all the courts around the country , is , no , no , no , no , the courts have the final word on what the Constitution means , and the Constitution is ultimately paramount . And that , I think , is what \u2019 s been heartening about what \u2019 s happened since the executive order . We went in within 24 hours of the executive order being passed , and by Saturday night , one day later , we had a nationwide injunction from Judge Donnelly in Brooklyn . And I think it gave everyone something to rally around , that the courts were going to play their traditional role . And so , that \u2019 s what I think has been heartening about this last 10 days .\nAMY GOODMAN : Let \u2019 s go back to the hearing . Judges William Canby\u2014he was a Carter appointee\u2014and Judge Richard Clifton , a George W. Bush appointee , questioned Justice Department attorney August Flentje on what oversight presidential orders can be subject to . This , first , is Judge Canby .\nJUDGE WILLIAM CANBY : Could the president simply say in the order , \u201c We \u2019 re not going to let any Muslims in \u201d ?\nJUDGE WILLIAM CANBY : Could he do that ? Could he do that ?\nJUDGE WILLIAM CANBY : Would anybody be able to challenge that ?\nJUDGE RICHARD CLIFTON : Well , we \u2019 d like to get to an answer to that question , I mean , because it speaks back to the standing issue . If the order said Muslims can not be admitted , would anybody have standing to challenge that ?\nAUGUST FLENTJE : I think Mandel and Din give a route to make a constitutional challenge if there were such an order . It would be by a U.S. citizen with a connection to someone seeking entry . This is a far cry from that situation .\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah . You know , the administration is trying to say , \u201c Look , this is not a Muslim ban . The word 'Muslim ' doesn \u2019 t appear , or 'Islam ' doesn \u2019 t appear , in the order. \u201d Well , that \u2019 s not what the courts do . The courts aren \u2019 t that easily fooled . What they do is look behind the face of the document . That \u2019 s standard Supreme Court law . Because , otherwise , you could have a state , the federal government , the president doing something with real discriminatory intent and then simply take out a few words . And I think that \u2019 s what\u2014you know , the administration ultimately was caught on that when former Mayor Rudy Giuliani said , \u201c Well , I told them this is how to do it . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : \u2014Rudolph Giuliani . He was speaking on Fox when he made this comment .\nRUDY GIULIANI : I \u2019 ll tell you the whole history of it . So , when he first announced it , he said , \u201c Muslim ban. \u201d He called me up . He said , \u201c Put a commission together . Show me the right way to do it legally. \u201d I put a commission together with Judge Mukasey , with Congressman McCaul , Pete King , whole group of other very expert lawyers on this . And what we did was , we focused on , instead of religion , danger ! The areas of the world that create danger for us , which is a factual basis , not a religious basis . Perfectly legal . Perfectly sensible . And that \u2019 s what the ban is based on . It \u2019 s not based on religion . It \u2019 s based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country .\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is December 2015 , not a surrogate for Donald Trump , but Donald Trump himself calling for a \u201c total and complete shutdown \u201d of the entry of Muslims to the United States .\nPRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP : Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States , until our country \u2019 s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on . We have no choice . We have no choice .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , these statements might impact the court \u2019 s ruling . Let \u2019 s go to another clip from the hearing , Judge Clifton asking Department of Justice lawyer August Flentje about anti-Muslim statements attributed to Trump and his advisers during his campaign . We hear first from the Justice Department attorney .\nAUGUST FLENTJE : It is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president \u2019 s national security determination based on some newspaper articles . And that \u2019 s what has happened here . That is not\u2014that is a very troubling second-guessing of the national security decision made by the president . And the notion that we are going to go back into court and\u2014\nJUDGE RICHARD CLIFTON : Do you deny the action\u2014stop , stop . This is Judge Clifton . Do you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then-candidate Trump and to his political advisers , most recently Mr. Giuliani\u2014do you deny that those statements were made ?\nAUGUST FLENTJE : Judge Clifton , I\u2014no . I would note that Judge Robart himself said that he wasn \u2019 t going to look at campaign statements . I do\u2014and I think that what we\u2014\nJUDGE RICHARD CLIFTON : No , that \u2019 s\u2014but , you see , that \u2019 s a different point . I mean , I understand the argument they shouldn \u2019 t be given much weight . But when you say we shouldn \u2019 t be looking at newspaper articles , let \u2019 s\u2014we \u2019 re all on the fast track here . Both sides have told us it \u2019 s moving too fast . Either those kind of statements were made or they \u2019 re not . Now , if they were made but they were made not to be a serious policy principle , I can understand that . But if they were made , it is potential evidence . It is a basis for an argument . So I just want to make sure I know what \u2019 s on the table .\nAUGUST FLENTJE : Well , those are in the record . But I think my point is a little narrower , that in the expedited procedure of a TRO , taking this extraordinary action of halting this order , that the president determined was in the national security interest of the United States , is\u2014is an unwise course . And it should be stayed .\nAMY GOODMAN : So that \u2019 s the Department of Justice lawyer , August Flentje . Lee Gelernt , if you can explain ? Because he makes the point : Only look at what \u2019 s on four corners of the document ; don \u2019 t look at the campaign ; don \u2019 t look at what people say .\nLEE GELERNT : Right , right . That \u2019 s wrong . You know , the Supreme Court has said over and over , you can look beyond the four corners of the document if there is evidence of discriminatory intent . And we \u2019 re not talking about a newspaper article . We \u2019 re talking about then-candidate Trump \u2019 s own statements , and not just one statement . If there was one offhand statement , you know , that \u2019 s one thing . But it \u2019 s over and over and over . And I think everyone knew what he intended with this executive order .\nThe other thing I would point out that \u2019 s getting lost is the order , on its face , discriminates among religions , not by denomination , but it does talk about minority religions and majority religions . And even that is prohibited by the Establishment Clause . The government is not supposed to be in the business of choosing between religions , particular religions , or even minority and majority . And after the executive order was signed , he very clearly said the minority religion provision was intended to benefit Christians . And in this country and under our Constitution , we don \u2019 t favor one religion over another . I mean , that \u2019 s the most bedrock principle in our country .\nAMY GOODMAN : They say they \u2019 re going to make a decision . It could be handed down today , tomorrow , the next day . What does it mean ? What are the possible choices these judges can make ?\nLEE GELERNT : Right . So , one thing is they can just simply affirm the district court and say , \u201c Look , we \u2019 re going to keep everything on hold while this case moves forward , \u201d because this is ultimately just temporary relief . Then , the U.S. government will have the opportunity to go to the Supreme Court , if they choose . It would be on a very fast track . I don \u2019 t know\u2014everyone is assuming they will . I don \u2019 t know that they will , when serious lawyers look at this and see how little time there is , because the case is moving on a very fast track back in district court . If it \u2019 s overturned , if the stay is overturned , Washington could go to the Supreme Court . You know , whether either side will remains to be seen .\nBut , ultimately , the case has to go forward , just like our case in New York , our case in Maryland\u2014the ACLU \u2019 s cases\u2014and other cases . Ultimately , we \u2019 re going to have to reach the merits of all this , because this is all preliminary skirmishes to keep the status quo . What this is all about is : Ultimately , who \u2019 s going to be harmed more during the interim , when the case is going forward ? I think it \u2019 s very clear , with refugees abroad who are in real danger and all of the other harms that befell people , that if you keep the executive order in place , people are going to be really harmed . The U.S. government could not come in with a countervailing harm , especially because all these people have been vetted . I mean , in our case , it was an\u2014it was an Iraqi who helped our U.S. military . And\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : It was two men that you were representing .\nLEE GELERNT : And on behalf of a whole class nationwide . And those were people who helped our U.S. military . But the government is putting out this narrative that we don \u2019 t know who \u2019 s coming in . But these were people who actually helped , put their lives at stake for our U.S. military . And then , all of a sudden , they \u2019 re landing here , and they \u2019 re saying , \u201c President Trump doesn \u2019 t want you , even though you put your lives at stake , at risk . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : So , President Trump clearly is not used to having people review his decisions as CEO of the Trump empire . So his first reaction was to lash out at the judge , call him a \u201c so-called judge. \u201d The significance of this , very quickly , Lee ?\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah . The rule of law is critical . The president has to respect the courts . I mean , that may be the overriding issue here . That \u2019 s bigger than any particular civil liberties issue .\nAMY GOODMAN : And clearly , there is trouble in the administration . You have the lawyer , Flentje , being replaced\u2014coming into this at the very last minute\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : \u2014in the hours before he argued this , in this very odd telephone call , where one of the judges was , what , in\u2014was in Hawaii\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : \u2014and another judge\u2014everyone was in a different place , and this was argued over the phone . He comes in , and when he \u2019 s seeing he might not be doing so well at the end , he says , \u201c Well , for one thing , at least don \u2019 t allow people who have never been in the United States to come into the United States \u201d \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : \u2014 \u201d if you \u2019 re going to make a partial decision. \u201d What about that ?\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah , a fallback argument . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s possible to sort of split it up now , especially how quickly things are moving , how the administration would actually implement such a division between people . And everyone is being harmed . I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s a wise course . But you can see that the government fell back on something , realized maybe they weren \u2019 t going to get everything they wanted , and tried at the last minute some sort of fallback , minor .\nAMY GOODMAN : Now , let me read you a tweet that just came out . Donald Trump didn \u2019 t respond to the hearing last night , but he did say , \u201c If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should , we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled . Politics ! \u201d And then he tweeted , \u201c I will be speaking at 9:00 A.M. today to Police Chiefs and Sheriffs and will be discussing the horrible , dangerous and wrong decision ....... \u201d And he moves on .\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah . We would prefer not to see the president say to the courts , \u201c If you do this , the whole country \u2019 s security is on you. \u201d I mean , I think the courts are doing what they are supposed to do and looking at the Constitution . They are doing their best . And they are a co-equal branch of the government .",

He said, \u201cPut a commission together.

And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger! The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal. Perfectly sensible. And that\u2019s what the ban is based on. It\u2019s not based on religion. It\u2019s based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And this is December 2015, not a surrogate for Donald Trump, but Donald Trump himself calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of the entry of Muslims to the United States.\n\nPRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, these statements might impact the court\u2019s ruling. Let\u2019s go to another clip from the hearing, Judge Clifton asking Department of Justice lawyer August Flentje about anti-Muslim statements attributed to Trump and his advisers during his campaign. We hear first from the Justice Department attorney.\n\nAUGUST FLENTJE: It is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president\u2019s national security determination based on some newspaper articles. And that\u2019s what has happened here. That is not\u2014that is a very troubling second-guessing of the national security decision made by the president. And the notion that we are going to go back into court and\u2014\n\nJUDGE RICHARD CLIFTON: Do you deny the action\u2014stop, stop. This is Judge Clifton. Do you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then-candidate Trump and to his political advisers, most recently Mr. Giuliani\u2014do you deny that those statements were made?\n\nAUGUST FLENTJE: Judge Clifton, I\u2014no. I would note that Judge Robart himself said that he wasn\u2019t going to look at campaign statements. I do\u2014and I think that what we\u2014\n\nJUDGE RICHARD CLIFTON: No, that\u2019s\u2014but, you see, that\u2019s a different point. I mean, I understand the argument they shouldn\u2019t be given much weight. But when you say we shouldn\u2019t be looking at newspaper articles, let\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re all on the fast track here. Both sides have told us it\u2019s moving too fast. Either those kind of statements were made or they\u2019re not. Now, if they were made but they were made not to be a serious policy principle, I can understand that. But if they were made, it is potential evidence. It is a basis for an argument. So I just want to make sure I know what\u2019s on the table.\n\nAUGUST FLENTJE: Well, those are in the record. But I think my point is a little narrower, that in the expedited procedure of a TRO, taking this extraordinary action of halting this order, that the president determined was in the national security interest of the United States, is\u2014is an unwise course. And it should be stayed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So that\u2019s the Department of Justice lawyer, August Flentje. Lee Gelernt, if you can explain? Because he makes the point: Only look at what\u2019s on four corners of the document; don\u2019t look at the campaign; don\u2019t look at what people say.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right, right. That\u2019s wrong. You know, the Supreme Court has said over and over, you can look beyond the four corners of the document if there is evidence of discriminatory intent. And we\u2019re not talking about a newspaper article. We\u2019re talking about then-candidate Trump\u2019s own statements, and not just one statement. If there was one offhand statement, you know, that\u2019s one thing. But it\u2019s over and over and over. And I think everyone knew what he intended with this executive order.\n\nThe other thing I would point out that\u2019s getting lost is the order, on its face, discriminates among religions, not by denomination, but it does talk about minority religions and majority religions. And even that is prohibited by the Establishment Clause. The government is not supposed to be in the business of choosing between religions, particular religions, or even minority and majority. And after the executive order was signed, he very clearly said the minority religion provision was intended to benefit Christians. And in this country and under our Constitution, we don\u2019t favor one religion over another. I mean, that\u2019s the most bedrock principle in our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, explain where this goes right now.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: They say they\u2019re going to make a decision. It could be handed down today, tomorrow, the next day. What does it mean? What are the possible choices these judges can make?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right. So, one thing is they can just simply affirm the district court and say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to keep everything on hold while this case moves forward,\u201d because this is ultimately just temporary relief. Then, the U.S. government will have the opportunity to go to the Supreme Court, if they choose. It would be on a very fast track. I don\u2019t know\u2014everyone is assuming they will. I don\u2019t know that they will, when serious lawyers look at this and see how little time there is, because the case is moving on a very fast track back in district court. If it\u2019s overturned, if the stay is overturned, Washington could go to the Supreme Court. You know, whether either side will remains to be seen.\n\nBut, ultimately, the case has to go forward, just like our case in New York, our case in Maryland\u2014the ACLU\u2019s cases\u2014and other cases. Ultimately, we\u2019re going to have to reach the merits of all this, because this is all preliminary skirmishes to keep the status quo. What this is all about is: Ultimately, who\u2019s going to be harmed more during the interim, when the case is going forward? I think it\u2019s very clear, with refugees abroad who are in real danger and all of the other harms that befell people, that if you keep the executive order in place, people are going to be really harmed. The U.S. government could not come in with a countervailing harm, especially because all these people have been vetted. I mean, in our case, it was an\u2014it was an Iraqi who helped our U.S. military. And\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is the first case you brought\u2014\n\nLEE GELERNT: Exactly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014racing to the Brooklyn court.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Exactly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: It was two men that you were representing.\n\nLEE GELERNT: And on behalf of a whole class nationwide. And those were people who helped our U.S. military. But the government is putting out this narrative that we don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming in. But these were people who actually helped, put their lives at stake for our U.S. military. And then, all of a sudden, they\u2019re landing here, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cPresident Trump doesn\u2019t want you, even though you put your lives at stake, at risk.\u201d\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, President Trump clearly is not used to having people review his decisions as CEO of the Trump empire. So his first reaction was to lash out at the judge, call him a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d The significance of this, very quickly, Lee?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah. The rule of law is critical. The president has to respect the courts. I mean, that may be the overriding issue here. That\u2019s bigger than any particular civil liberties issue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And clearly, there is trouble in the administration. You have the lawyer, Flentje, being replaced\u2014coming into this at the very last minute\u2014\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right, right, right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014in the hours before he argued this, in this very odd telephone call, where one of the judges was, what, in\u2014was in Hawaii\u2014\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014and another judge\u2014everyone was in a different place, and this was argued over the phone. He comes in, and when he\u2019s seeing he might not be doing so well at the end, he says, \u201cWell, for one thing, at least don\u2019t allow people who have never been in the United States to come into the United States\u201d\u2014\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014\u201dif you\u2019re going to make a partial decision.\u201d What about that?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah, a fallback argument. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to sort of split it up now, especially how quickly things are moving, how the administration would actually implement such a division between people. And everyone is being harmed. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a wise course. But you can see that the government fell back on something, realized maybe they weren\u2019t going to get everything they wanted, and tried at the last minute some sort of fallback, minor.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Now, let me read you a tweet that just came out. Donald Trump didn\u2019t respond to the hearing last night, but he did say, \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!\u201d And then he tweeted, \u201cI will be speaking at 9:00 A.M. today to Police Chiefs and Sheriffs and will be discussing the horrible, dangerous and wrong decision.......\u201d And he moves on.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah. We would prefer not to see the president say to the courts, \u201cIf you do this, the whole country\u2019s security is on you.\u201d I mean, I think the courts are doing what they are supposed to do and looking at the Constitution. They are doing their best. And they are a co-equal branch of the government.",
