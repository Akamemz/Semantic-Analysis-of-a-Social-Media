    "content": "After Contentious Interview , Pompeo Publicly Accuses NPR Journalist Of Lying To Him\nOne day after a contentious interview that was followed by an expletive-filled verbal lashing of NPR host Mary Louise Kelly , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is publicly accusing her of lying to him \u2014 `` twice . ''\nIn a statement released by the State Department on Saturday , Pompeo says Kelly first lied `` in setting up our interview . ''\nHe does not explain how and offers no evidence . In their recorded interview from Friday , the nation 's top diplomat declined to respond when Kelly asked whether he owed an apology to Marie Yovanovitch , the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . She was ousted from that post last year after allies of President Trump accused her of disloyalty .\n`` I agreed to come on your show today , '' Pompeo replied , `` to talk about Iran . ''\nKelly pushed back , telling Pompeo , `` I confirmed with your staff last night that I would talk about Iran and Ukraine . '' She later said she specifically flagged her intention to do so in writing , noting , `` I never agree to take any topics off the table . ''\nPompeo asserts Kelly again lied `` in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record . ''\nThat unrecorded conversation took place when the Pompeo aide who cut off the formal interview summoned Kelly to the secretary 's private living room .\nKelly told her All Things Considered co-host Ari Shapiro on Friday that Pompeo , who had walked out of the interview only after `` he leaned in , glared at me , '' was waiting for her in his private quarters .\n`` He shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the [ 9-minute ] interview itself had lasted , '' Kelly told Shapiro . `` He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine . He asked , 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine ? ' He used the F-word in that sentence and many others . ''\nPompeo then had a pop quiz for Kelly , a veteran national security correspondent who has reported from China , Russia and , most recently , Iran .\n`` He asked if I could find Ukraine on a map ; I said yes , '' she continued . `` He called out for his aides to bring him a map of the world with no writing , no countries marked .

' ``\nContrary to Pompeo 's claim , Kelly said she did not agree that their conversation would be off the record . She said that while the staffer who led her to Pompeo 's private quarters had stipulated that she not bring a recorder , `` she did not say we were off the record , nor would I have agreed . ''\nIn his statement on Saturday , Pompeo further berates Kelly . `` It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency , '' he writes . `` This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration .

''\nHe ends the statement with an assertion that appears to falsely imply Kelly was unable to locate Ukraine on a map .\n`` It is worth noting , '' he concludes with no further explanation , `` that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine .
