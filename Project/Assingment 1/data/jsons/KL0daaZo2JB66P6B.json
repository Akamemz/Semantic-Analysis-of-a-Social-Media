Martha McSally exhorted her colleagues in a private pre-vote pep rally on Capitol Hill , as House Republicans entrusted their futures to fate and agreed to vote to repeal Obamacare .\nNearby , House Speaker Paul Ryan was `` giddy , '' said one colleague , sensing the narrowest of reputation-saving wins after a trial by political fire . Down Pennsylvania Avenue , as Thursday 's vote neared , President Donald Trump settled in front of a TV , his Twitter account poised , but slipping into the unusual state of calm that aides say envelops the hyperactive commander-in-chief when moments of history beckon .\nFor Democrats , by contrast , there was only deflation and despair -- as Obamacare , the law with nine lives , absorbed a dramatic blow . But thoughts of revenge also stirred . GOP lawmakers filed out of the House to a serenade : `` Na , Na , Na , Na , Hey , Hey , Goodbye , '' from Democrats convinced the Republicans had sealed their fate in the 2018 mid-terms .\nDespite the Trump and GOP victory rally at the White House , the past few months are just an appetizer as the bill goes to the Senate and members head home to their constituents . There will be more rounds of Republican strife and debates over arcane parliamentary procedure with a new cast of lawmakers . Vice President Mike Pence -- who keeps Capitol Police officers busy with his frequent visits -- will spend more time in his Hill office .

The tweets will undoubtedly continue .\nThis article relates behind-the-scenes negotiations and the emotional and political storm that raged on Capitol Hill as the House GOP belatedly , but triumphantly , honored a promise to its voters that it first made seven years ago and has renewed many times since .\nBased on dozens of conversations with Republican and Democratic leaders , lawmakers and political aides by CNN 's teams on Capitol Hill and in the White House , it reveals how House GOP members finally steeled themselves to overcome the infighting and inaction that tarnished Trump 's First 100 Days .\nIt is also the story of how the GOP decided that the price of inaction now was greater than the risk of passing a bill that even many Senate Republicans believe is deeply flawed .\n`` I think people in the House just simply wanted to get a bill out of the House and hoped that the Senate did something with it , '' said Rep. Charlie Dent , one of 20 Republicans who voted no .\nBut for those on the other side , victory tastes sweet .\n`` This is a great plan , '' Trump said at the White House , seemingly looking forward to the next round . `` I actually think it will get even better .

Though Democrats and many policy experts say $ 8 billion is a drop in the bucket of the cash needed to fund high risk pools , Upton 's decision was crucial .\n`` It gave our guys a clear-cut reason to get to yes , '' one senior GOP aide said .\nBy Wednesday night , less than 12 hours after the full details emerged of the latest change to a seemingly ever evolving , always-rejected piece of legislation , Republican leaders met in Ryan 's office .
