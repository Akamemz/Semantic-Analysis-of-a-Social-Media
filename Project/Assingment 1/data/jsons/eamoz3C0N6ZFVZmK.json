Medicare for All proponents have been making the case that people \u2019 s overall health care costs would decrease even if taxes are higher , as polls show that many Americans could be scared off by the tax hikes .\nA survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in January found that overall support for Medicare for All drops when people hear that it would require most Americans to pay more in taxes .

Similarly , a Monmouth University survey released Thursday found that a majority of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers prefer a health plan where people can opt-in to Medicare over Medicare for All .\nPatrick Murray , director of Monmouth \u2019 s polling institute , said that the preference for a public option among Democrats has more to do with concerns about losing private insurance and viewing Medicare for All as unrealistic than concerns about tax increases .
