    "content": "Last week , a technology reporter for the Washington Post named Craig Timberg ran an incredible story . It has no analog that I can think of in modern times . Headlined \u201c Russian propaganda effort helped spread \u2018 fake news \u2019 during election , experts say , \u201d the piece promotes the work of a shadowy group that smears some 200 alternative news outlets as either knowing or unwitting agents of a foreign power , including popular sites like Truthdig and Naked Capitalism .\nThe thrust of Timberg \u2019 s astonishingly lazy report is that a Russian intelligence operation of some kind was behind the publication of a \u201c hurricane \u201d of false news reports during the election season , in particular stories harmful to Hillary Clinton . The piece referenced those 200 websites as \u201c routine peddlers of Russian propaganda . \u201d\nThe piece relied on what it claimed were \u201c two teams of independent researchers , \u201d but the citing of a report by the longtime anticommunist Foreign Policy Research Institute was really window dressing .\nThe meat of the story relied on a report by unnamed analysts from a single mysterious \u201c organization \u201d called PropOrNot \u2013 we don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s one person or , as it claims , over 30 \u2013 a \u201c group \u201d that seems to have been in existence for just a few months .\nIt was PropOrNot \u2019 s report that identified what it calls \u201c the list \u201d of 200 offending sites . Outlets as diverse as AntiWar.com , LewRockwell.com and the Ron Paul Institute were described as either knowingly directed by Russian intelligence , or \u201c useful idiots \u201d who unwittingly did the bidding of foreign masters .\nForget that the Post offered no information about the \u201c PropOrNot \u201d group beyond that they were \u201c a collection of researchers with foreign policy , military and technology backgrounds . \u201d\nForget also that the group offered zero concrete evidence of coordination with Russian intelligence agencies , even offering this remarkable disclaimer about its analytic methods :\n\u201c Please note that our criteria are behavioral . \u2026 For purposes of this definition it does not matter \u2026 whether they even knew they were echoing Russian propaganda at any particular point : If they meet these criteria , they are at the very least acting as bona-fide \u2018 useful idiots \u2019 of the Russian intelligence services , and are worthy of further scrutiny . \u201d\nWhat this apparently means is that if you published material that meets their definition of being \u201c useful \u201d to the Russian state , you could be put on the \u201c list , \u201d and \u201c warrant further scrutiny . \u201d\nForget even that in its Twitter responses to criticism of its report , PropOrNot sounded not like a group of sophisticated military analysts , but like one teenager :\n\u201c Awww , wook at all the angwy Putinists , trying to change the subject \u2013 they \u2019 re so vewwy angwy ! ! \u201d it wrote on Saturday .\n\u201c Fascists . Straight up muthafuckin \u2019 fascists . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re up against , \u201d it wrote last Tuesday , two days before Timberg \u2019 s report .\nAny halfway decent editor would have been scared to death by any of these factors . Moreover the vast majority of reporters would have needed to see something a lot more concrete than a half-assed theoretical paper from such a dicey source before denouncing 200 news organizations as traitors .\nBut if that same source also demanded anonymity on the preposterous grounds that it feared being \u201c targeted by Russia \u2019 s legions of skilled hackers \u201d ? Any sane reporter would have booted them out the door . You want to blacklist hundreds of people , but you won \u2019 t put your name to your claims ? Take a hike .\nYet the Post thought otherwise , and its report was uncritically picked up by other outlets like USA Today and the Daily Beast . The \u201c Russians did it \u201d story was greedily devoured by a growing segment of blue-state America that is beginning to fall victim to the same conspiracist tendencies that became epidemic on the political right in the last few years .\nThe right-wing fascination with conspiracy has culminated in a situation where someone like Alex Jones of Infowars ( who believes juice boxes make frogs gay ) is considered a news source . Jones is believed even by our new president-elect , who just repeated one of his outrageous reports , to the effect that three million undocumented immigrants voted in the November 8th election .\nThat Jones report was based on a tweet by someone named Greg Phillips of an organization called VoteStand .\nWhen asked to comment on his methodology , Phillips replied in the first person plural , sounding like a lone spree killer claiming to be a national terror network . \u201c No . We will release it in open form to the American people , \u201d he said . \u201c We won \u2019 t allow the media to spin this first . Sorry . \u201d\nThis was remarkably similar to the response of PropOrNot when asked by The Intercept to comment about its \u201c list \u201d report .
