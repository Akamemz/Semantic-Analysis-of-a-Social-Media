The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve 40 judicial picks this week , creating a glut of new nominations headed to the floor .\nUnder current rules , at 30 hours of debate per nominee , the Senate can confirm perhaps five per week \u2014 meaning it would take eight weeks of floor time to go through the judgeships with no other major action intervening .
