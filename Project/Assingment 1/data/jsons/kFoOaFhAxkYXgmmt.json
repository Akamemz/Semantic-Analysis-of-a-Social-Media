    "content": "Following the 1806 rule change , a minority could begin to use the filibuster to obstruct actions in the Senate . But that didn \u2019 t really happen . In fact , for most of American history , majorities who held both the House and the Senate were generally able to get through nominations and laws , as the Framers intended .\nScholars debate the lessons of early congressional history . Some point to a 1790 debate over where to locate Congress as the earliest example of delay tactics akin to a filibuster . Others mention early master obstructionists , such as Virginia \u2019 s John Randolph and South Carolina \u2019 s John C. Calhoun . For example , as Erwin Chemerinsky and Catherine Fisk explain , Randolph had \u201c compiled such a record for protracted irrelevant talk during his service in the House and his subsequent brief tenure in the Senate that Thomas Jefferson used the generic term \u2018 a John Randolph \u2019 to describe one who protracted the proceedings of Congress. \u201d And , as Chafetz notes , Calhoun \u201c repeatedly used \u201d delay tactics \u201c in an attempt to protect the interests of the Southern states . \u201d\nChemerinsky and Fisk also point to specific examples of early filibusters in antebellum America\u2014for instance , in fights over patronage positions on the Congressional Globe and in a battle over the national bank . By 1863 , the filibuster\u2014as an exercise in obstruction\u2014had acquired its official name .
