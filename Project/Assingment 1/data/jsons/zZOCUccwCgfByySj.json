If emissions continue at this rate , according to scientists , the earth could see a further increase that would put total warming at 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels sometime between 2030 and 2052 . The 1.5-degree threshold is one environmentalist have long claimed should be the cap for worldwide warming , or else the planet will face catastrophic consequences .\nAccording to the report , `` Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1 degree Celsius of global warming above pre-industrial levels .
