    "content": "( CNN ) A lawyer for an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani told CNN that his client is willing to tell Congress about meetings the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee had in Vienna last year with a former Ukrainian prosecutor to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden .\nThe attorney , Joseph A. Bondy , represents Lev Parnas , the recently indicted Soviet-born American who worked with Giuliani to push claims of Democratic corruption in Ukraine . Bondy said that Parnas was told directly by the former Ukrainian official that he met last year in Vienna with Rep. Devin Nunes .\n`` Mr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December , '' said Bondy .\nShokin was ousted from his position in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders , including then-vice president Biden , over concerns that Shokin was not pursuing corruption cases .\nNunes is one of President Donald Trump 's key allies in Congress and has emerged as a staunch defender of the President during the impeachment inquiry , which he has frequently labeled as a `` circus . '' Nunes declined repeated requests for comment .\nAfter the story published , Nunes disputed CNN 's report , telling far-right website Breitbart that it was `` demonstrably false . ''\nGiuliani made an appearance on Fox News on Saturday and , when asked about the CNN report , said he had no reason to doubt Nunes .\nBondy told CNN that his client and Nunes began communicating around the time of the Vienna trip . Parnas says he worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help Nunes dig up dirt on Biden and Democrats in Ukraine , according to Bondy .\nThat information would likely be of great interest to House Democrats given its overlap with the current impeachment inquiry into President Trump , and could put Nunes in a difficult spot .\nBondy told CNN his client is willing to comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry in a manner that would allow him to protect his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination .\nBondy suggested in a tweet on Friday that he was already speaking to House Intel though the committee declined to comment .\nGiuliani has told CNN previously about his conversations with Shokin and Parnas , saying that this was part of his legal work for his client , President Trump . Parnas ' claims about Nunes ' alleged involvement offers a new wrinkle and for the first time suggests the efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens involved a member of Congress .\nParnas ' claim that Nunes met with Shokin , which had not been previously reported , adds further context to a Daily Beast report that Parnas helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe for Nunes last year , citing another Parnas ' lawyer , Ed MacMahon .\nThose revelations came to a head on Thursday when Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell raised the Daily Beast story publicly during the impeachment hearing .\nParnas , who was indicted on federal campaign finance charges last month , worked with Shokin and Giuliani to push a pair of unfounded claims : that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats , and that Biden was acting corruptly in Ukraine on behalf of his son Hunter , who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings .\nAccording to Bondy , Parnas claims Nunes worked to push similar allegations of Democratic corruption .\n`` Nunes had told Shokin of the urgent need to launch investigations into Burisma , Joe and Hunter Biden , and any purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election , '' Bondy told CNN .\nThere is no evidence that the Bidens acted inappropriately .

''\nAsked again on Thursday about his travel to Vienna and his interactions with Shokin and Parnas , Nunes gave a similar response .\n`` To be perfectly clear , I do n't acknowledge any questions from you in this lifetime or the next lifetime , '' Nunes said while leaving the impeachment hearing . `` I do n't acknowledge any question from you ever .
