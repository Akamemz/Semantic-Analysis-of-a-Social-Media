But now , people often stop him in the street to ask him how he \u2019 s holding up , or to engage him on politics .\nThis kind of face recognition is all new for the 30-something investigative journalist , who has worked mostly for critical news outlets on the opposition-leaning fringes of Russia \u2019 s media spectrum . But he exploded into the public eye when he was arrested and clumsily framed by Moscow narcotics police last June \u2013 and inadvertently created a teachable moment for politically aware Russians and his fellow journalists .\nTo most Russia observers it looked drearily familiar \u2013 an uncompromising reporter being removed by corrupt authorities wielding fake criminal charges . But then something unusual happened . His incarceration was met by a huge and rapid outpouring of popular support for him , including from many of his more mainstream colleagues in the Russian media . Three leading Moscow newspapers ran identical front pages declaring , \u201c We are Ivan Golunov ! \u201d\nThen the case against him swiftly unraveled , police dropped charges , and within five days he was back on the job , free to publish the article about corruption in the Moscow funeral business that had gotten him into trouble in the first place . Last month , five officers involved in setting Mr. Golunov up were arrested and charged with abuse of power , falsification of evidence , and drug trafficking .\nThe whole thing shocked him . \u201c I really only learned about the public support for me after I was released , \u201d says a relaxed-looking Mr. Golunov , drinking tea in a central Moscow restaurant recently . \u201c When I was at my court hearing , I heard the commotion outside and wondered what all the shouting was about . But the idea that over a thousand people had come out to protest for me , well that was just amazing . I never imagined the reaction could be that big . \u201d\nGalina Arapova , head of a civil society group that works for journalists \u2019 rights in the central Russian city of Voronezh , says that Mr. Golunov \u2019 s freedom is something to celebrate in itself . But even more important is the inspiration it has given to Russian journalists , who need to tread the line between truth-telling and irritating the authorities every day , and the expectations of Russia \u2019 s fairly sophisticated news-reading public .\n\u201c I think Ivan \u2019 s case has stirred up the journalist community , which has been gradually maturing \u201d over many years , Ms. Arapova says . \u201c The basic lesson here is that every journalist needs to work with the secure knowledge that he or she can depend on the solidarity of colleagues in a moment of trouble . This is essential for all journalists who want to do their jobs honestly . \u201d\nMr. Golunov is a child of Russia \u2019 s turbulent 1990s when Russian society imploded , old value systems were utterly discredited , and almost everyone was struggling to reinvent himself . His parents , Moscow professionals , kept changing his school . At one point he found himself in one of the new experimental schools that cropped up amid the post-Soviet wasteland , where teachers encouraged him to concentrate on self-development .\nDmitry Serebryakov/AP Former Russian police officer Igor Lyakhovets is escorted to a courtroom in Moscow on Jan. 30 , 2020 . He is one of five former officers facing charges stemming from the June 2019 arrest of Ivan Golunov .\nThat \u2019 s how he discovered journalism , he says , at the age of 13 . He went to work for a local free paper aimed at youth where , in the wake of Russia \u2019 s devastating 1998 financial crisis , he wrote about counterculture , educational affairs , and other news from his own district . Later he joined a municipal paper put out by local authorities , where he covered the news from the point of view of his bosses .\n\u201c I was happily writing about successes , how great our local authorities were , \u201d he says . \u201c I believe my last story for them was something about how , by the efforts of our local authorities , a war veteran had his bathroom replaced . That was the sort of thing I did . \u201d\nHe gradually became interested in issues that fell a bit outside the box , such as the rights of disabled people and the dismal level of Moscow \u2019 s public accessibility for them . He wrote a piece about that and took it to the opposition newspaper , Novaya Gazeta , which is partly owned by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . They gave him a full-time job . \u201c Novaya Gazeta always took in young people and gave them a chance to work and learn , \u201d he says .\nHis first introduction to investigative journalism came when he was given the job of checking official military casualty statistics from the then-raging Second Chechen War against the actual number of coffins being recorded in Russia \u2019 s far-flung regions by the Committees of Soldiers \u2019 Mothers , a grassroots anti-military group . He found massive discrepancies .\n\u201c We compiled lists based on what the Soldiers \u2019 Mothers committees around the country told us , and published them alongside the official statistics , \u201d he says . \u201c That created quite a stir . The Ministry of Defense , which had been releasing figures just once a month , began publishing them every three days . And they were much more accurate . We realized that our efforts had made the difference and forced them to react , to provide better information .\n\u201c I was just 16 then . And at this moment I understood the importance of the job I was doing , \u201d Mr. Golunov says . Military prosecutors would call to exchange information , and he was sometimes summoned to court to provide evidence in war-related cases . \u201c I was not just informing my readers ; I was also informing the authorities of things that were going on , and that was leading to changes . \u201d\nMr. Golunov went on to work for a string of critical news outlets , including Gazeta , the TV station Dozhd , Russian Forbes , RBK , and the online magazine Slon.ru . In some cases he was forced to leave by ownership changes that narrowed the scope for independent reporting . At other times he moved on driven by his own restlessness . About three years ago he found a home with the Latvia-based news agency Meduza , which he says encouraged him to do the stories he felt were most needed .\nThat \u2019 s the short version of how he found himself one day last June shoved up against a wall , handcuffed by Moscow narcotics police outside a cafe where he had gone to meet a source , and shouting to passersby to please phone his editor as he was bundled into a police van . After more than six months of freedom and newfound fame , he is still deeply dissatisfied .\n\u201c I know there is a struggle within the system , \u201d he says . \u201c I know there are good cops who only want to do their jobs properly , because I have met them . But they aren \u2019 t making the difference . This thing happened to me . It attracted public attention , it caused a big commotion , but to this day no one is punished . People tell me they don \u2019 t believe that top-ranking officials will ever be punished for abusing their power . That \u2019 s bad . I want to live in a country where people have confidence that perpetrators will be brought to justice .\n\u201c Many people I know say they see no point in going into the streets to protest . I tell them that there can be results .
