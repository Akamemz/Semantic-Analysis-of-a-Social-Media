'' But planning began Friday night , 36 hours before the event began , and there was n't enough time for the `` onerous and significant '' security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit , Earnest said . He said Obama 's presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there .\n`` That said , there is no doubt that the American people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in France as they face down this threat , '' he said . `` And that was evident throughout last week .
