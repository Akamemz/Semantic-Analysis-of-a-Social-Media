    "content": "According to various reports , Megyn Kelly has not only \u201c parted ways \u201d with NBC after losing her coveted 9 a.m. hour on NBC \u2019 s Today Show , she lost her representation at the powerful CAA talent agency .\nWorse , when she tried to move to UTA , her \u201c blackface \u201d comments closed that door .\nBecause she is now toxic , on Wednesday , Kelly could only hire an attorney to represent her , a move that points to her fighting for every penny left on her three-year , $ 69 million contract \u2014 an agreement that was not set to expire with NBC until 2020 .\nAfter 12 years as a superstar at Fox News and a disastrous , calamitous , dumpster fire two ( give or take ) years at NBC , Kelly is about to go kicking and screaming as she exits stage left , but exit stage left she will because she has no place left to go\u2026 Which I think was always NBC \u2019 s plan\u2026\nLuring Megyn Kelly to NBC was never about anything other than destroying Megyn Kelly .\nWhat NBC News did to Kelly has happened before . With the lure of a dream job attached to a hook that fulfills a rival \u2019 s hubris , the rival is humiliated and forever destroyed . It \u2019 s an old trick and Kelly and her ego fell for it .\nIn 1979 , the New Yorker \u2019 s Pauline Kael was the most influential film critic in America . With this power , she made Warren Beatty her pet cause throughout the 1970s \u2014 and then she turned on him , attacking Beatty and his 1978 hit Heaven Can Wait ( which he co-wrote and directed ) as a sellout , a trifle , a betrayal .\nMany believe Beatty got his revenge by offering Kael her dream job , the opportunity to work with him on his next film . As quickly as that came together , though , it flamed out . Within a year Kael had very publicly failed in Hollywood and was forced to crawl back to the New Yorker . Only now , she looked foolish and weak , and would never again wield the same power .\nThroughout the late \u2019 80s and early \u2019 90s , Michael Ovitz was not only the most powerful agent in Hollywood , he was the town \u2019 s undisputed King \u2014 a powerbroker \u2019 s powerbroker and the scourge of the studios as he shifted industry power to his clients \u2014 to actors and directors . Then Disney chairman Michael Eisner offered Ovitz his dream job , the opportunity to run a studio . Promised he was being groomed to eventually replace Eisner , Ovitz bit .\nSixteen months later Eisner fired him , and that was the end of Michael Ovitz .\nOver at Fox News , Megyn Kelly was not only a ratings powerhouse and superstar , her smarts , preparation , and fearlessness made her an icon \u2014 especially to women , who saw in her someone they could relate to . Suddenly , the image of a powerful woman did not need to include the left \u2019 s noxious politics and man-hating .\nLike most larger-than-life figures , though , Kelly has a fatal flaw , and like Kael and Ovitz , it is hubris . Being one of the most popular and powerful anchors in the \u201c ghetto \u201d of cable news was no longer enough . She wanted it all . She wanted to be accepted and loved by the establishment media . So , through Machiavellian means , starting with the public betrayal of her Fox fans , she let the establishment media know she was ready to become one of them .\nHer plan was to single-handedly take down Donald Trump . This was her way of sending a message , her way of letting potential suitors know she was ready to sell out , to join the Borg collective , and to enjoy all the rewards that come to sellouts ( see : SE Cupp , Joe Scarborough , Matthew Dowd , Nicolle Wallace , etc\u2026 ) .\nAs she betrayed her Fox fans with her shrill and narcissistic attacks on Trump , Kelly readied the second part of her plan , a memoir titled Settle for More . The promotional tour was perfectly timed \u2014 it would begin just days after Trump lost the presidential election .\nThe book tour was supposed to be Kelly \u2019 s triumph , her victory parade where all the Beautiful People would not only credit her for defeating the villainous Trump , but exalt her as noble and brave for doing so by stabbing her own fans in the back . But then\u2026\nTrump won the presidency , and instead of looking like a champion , Kelly looked exposed \u2014 ridiculous , caught off guard , and foolish .\nBy this time , NBC News had already lured her into their trap .\nBy design , by deliberately setting her up for failure , Kelly was doomed from day one at NBC \u2014 and it didn \u2019 t even cost a lot of money . For a mere $ 69 million , a pittance to NBC , the establishment media was able to take out a business and cultural rival in a little over a year .\nTo begin with , NBC intentionally ignored Kelly \u2019 s strengths , which shine in a live and combative format . First they handed her a 60 Minutes-type program , something she had never done before , and then they slotted Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly directly up against 60 Minutes , which has been a ratings juggernaut for 40 years . Then NBC allowed Kelly to air an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin that made no news . Then they allowed Kelly to interview Alex Jones . Then they allowed her to crash and burn in this format , a format she had no business being a part of , and take 100 % of the blame for that failure .\nNBC then led Kelly even deeper into alien territory \u2014 a gooey morning show geared towards puffery and celebrity interviews .\nAs designed , Megyn Kelly Today was a disaster from day one . Kelly again looked ridiculous , out of her element and depth . Her mishaps were legion , and they were never forgiven because the establishment would never forgive her for her time at Fox News . Rather than circle the wagons , as they always do to protect one of their own , they just pointed and laughed and piled on .\nKelly was flailing , drowning , and no one was coming to her rescue . Then she went under\u2026\nDuring the Tuesday edition of Megyn Kelly Today , Kelly and her guests were discussing a white woman on The Real Housewives of New York who dressed up like Diana Ross and went so far as to darken her skin with makeup .\n\u201c But what is racist ? \u201d Kelly asked . \u201c Because truly , you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween , or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween . Like , back when I was a kid , that was okay , as long as you were dressing up as , like , a character . \u201d\nWith these comments on Monday , Kelly handed NBC the murder weapon they had been waiting for .
