We 're failing to use a key weapon that needs to be used .\nThere 's no question that the United States has been extremely effective tactically against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups since 9/11 .

This is why the strategic tool known as `` countering violent extremism , '' or CVE , has to be used alongside special operations , drones and other weapons .\nAs an FBI Special Agent , I interrogated dozens of senior terrorists . It quickly became clear that part of al Qaeda 's effectiveness in gaining recruits was in their tailoring their rhetoric and their messenger to the personality , location and likely local grievances of their target .\nExtremists wo n't use a Yemeni railing about U.S. `` crimes '' in Iraq to try to appeal to American-Somali youths in Minnesota .

That has been a major factor in the increase in homegrown terrorism in the West , seen horrifically on May 22 on the streets of London and April 15 at the Boston Marathon .\nIn his recent speech on terrorism , President Obama told the nation that the values the United States holds will ultimately defeat the terrorists .
