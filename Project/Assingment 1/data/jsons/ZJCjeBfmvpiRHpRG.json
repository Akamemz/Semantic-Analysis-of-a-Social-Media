    "content": "In many ways , McConnell reflects the changing history of both his party and state . As a young Republican in Democratic-leaning Kentucky , McConnell was something of a centrist : He watched supportively from the Capitol steps as the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke after the March on Washington ; during his first race , in Louisville , he ran on a platform that included support for collective-bargaining rights ; he was endorsed by local labor groups as well as The Courier-Journal . He even backed Gerald R. Ford over Ronald Reagan and , four years later , backed other Republicans over the future conservative president . He had a dog named Rocky , after Nelson A. Rockefeller \u2014 a nugget in Dyche \u2019 s book supplied by McConnell \u2019 s first wife , Sherrill Redmon , a retired scholar at Smith College who collaborated with Gloria Steinem .\nBut after reaching the Senate , McConnell fell in line with the conservatism that was sweeping his party . Over time , he changed his mind on collective-bargaining rights and minimum-wage increases and abandoned the pork-barrel spending projects he once boasted of delivering . ( McConnell is responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in public projects in his home state . ) According to McConnell , his rightward shift reflected the growing appeal of conservatism : \u201c Reagan \u2019 s extraordinary success was a good example for everybody right of center. \u201d It also helped his path to that far-off goal . In 1997 , McConnell became the head of the Senate Republicans \u2019 campaign arm ; five years later , he ascended to his party \u2019 s deputy post , which paved the way for him to become the Republican leader after Frist stepped aside . \u201c Mitch enjoys the power and the prestige of the office , \u201d says Steven L. Beshear , the Democratic governor of Kentucky , who lost a Senate race to McConnell in 1996 . \u201c And if you \u2019 ll notice , he has changed his position on any number of issues because he thinks that \u2019 ll keep him in office and keep him in control of that power. \u201d Todd Hollenbach , who was unseated by McConnell in Jefferson County in 1977 , is harsher : \u201c He \u2019 s whatever he needs to be for the occasion. \u201d For his part , McConnell didn \u2019 t entirely disagree about his political evolution , particularly regarding his party \u2019 s formula for success . \u201c I don \u2019 t know whether you can call me more centrist back then or not , \u201d he said . \u201c But I certainly was supporting candidates who , in retrospect , look more centrist. \u201d He explained succinctly : \u201c I wanted to win . \u201d\nAs McConnell sat on a chair in his office , with Cooper and Barkley looking down on him , I asked what he planned to do if he ascended to majority leader . The country is more divided than at any time during his tenure . What could he do to reverse the tide ? \u201c The first job is to restore the Senate , and I fully intend to do that , \u201d he said , explaining that he wanted it to be the chamber of deliberative debate , as it was during Cooper \u2019 s day , rather than mere political theater . I pressed McConnell on this pledge . Even if Senate Republicans controlled 51 seats , they would face an array of tough races in 2016 , stemming from their success in Democratic-leaning states during the sweep of 2010 . Won \u2019 t McConnell seek to protect his fragile majority , as Reid has in recent years , by barring amendments to bills , thus preventing senators from taking politically perilous votes ? \u201c The price of being in the majority is you have to take a lot of bad votes in order to get a bill across the floor , \u201d he said . \u201c And if you didn \u2019 t want to vote , you shouldn \u2019 t have come to the Senate . \u201d\nYet for McConnell , the substance of a particular deal often seems less intoxicating than the act of making the deal . \u201c Some politicians fish to relieve the tension , \u201d says Karl Rove , a former adviser to George W.
