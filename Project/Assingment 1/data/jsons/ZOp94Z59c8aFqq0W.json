A number of states and businesses also now require mask-wearing in some capacity .\nSurveys suggest that many people are complying with such directives : More than two-thirds of respondents to a mid-May HuffPost/YouGov poll , for example , said they either always or mostly wore a face covering while in public and close to other people . Some 83 % said they did not view that act as a sign of weakness , and 69 % said they saw it as a sign of respectfulness .\nBut viral incidents of mask resistance have cropped up around the country : A video last month showed a Colorado Costco COST , +1.34 % employee bouncing a non-mask-wearing customer whose defense was that he \u201c woke up in a free country . \u201d\n\u201c A video last month showed a Colorado Costco employee bouncing a non-mask wearing customer whose defense was that he \u2018 woke up in a free country . \u2019 \u201d\nSome protesters have reportedly tried to co-opt disability and medical privacy laws to exempt themselves from wearing masks .

Explain that your workplace mandates mask-wearing for everybody and it \u2019 s your job to enforce the rules , she said , \u201c so it \u2019 s less about attacking them and their specific decision . \u201d\nIt can also help to direct the person to resources , like extra masks , she said . Whole Foods AMZN , -0.71 % , for example , announced in late April that it would offer free disposable masks to customers .\nChapman said that if a student came to her office hours without a face covering , she would appeal to Carnegie Mellon \u2019 s guidance that everyone on campus wear one \u2014 that way , the student would be less likely to take it personally .\n\u201c Even if that university rule weren \u2019 t there , I could say , \u2018 I have a personal rule that I \u2019 ll only meet with people when we \u2019 re all wearing masks , so could you put on a mask ? \u2019 \u201d she said . Publicizing the rules ahead of time isn \u2019 t a bad idea , she added .\nBloomfield advised against engaging with strangers who aren \u2019 t wearing masks in a store or outside . \u201c If you don \u2019 t have any power or authority in a situation , people probably aren \u2019 t going to react kindly or openly to being policed by others , \u201d she said . \u201c Direct confrontation with people you don \u2019 t know is not a good idea. \u201d ( This person might also not be wearing a mask for reasons you don \u2019 t know about , like a disability . )\nIf you do engage with someone , use \u201c I \u201d messages rather than \u201c you \u201d messages , ask questions , study the person \u2019 s nonverbal behavior for emotional cues , and try to empathize with their reason for not wearing a mask , Abrams said . Stay calm , firm and neutral , he added , and \u201c be curious about them rather than impose your will on them . \u201d\n\u201c Attacking someone , criticizing them for not doing the right thing \u2014 that almost never works , \u201d Emanuel added .\nFriends and family members will be easier to talk to since you share a personal connection , Bloomfield said . If you know the person , \u201c you could certainly appeal to common values and experiences , \u201d she added . \u201c Perhaps you know people in common who are particularly at risk for contracting the disease . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s important to \u201c make it easy for people to do the right thing , \u201d said Emanuel . \u201c In an ideal world , we would have lots of masks that are free or very cheap , \u201d he said . On an individual level , increasing ease might look like carrying around extra masks to give to people who need them , he said , or sewing or buying masks for your relatives or roommates . Keep masks near the door so they \u2019 re easy to grab when your family goes out .\nIn the workplace , he added , you could \u201c encourage \u2014 maybe even demand \u2014 that your employer provide suitable masks. \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s what it means to operate a safe work environment these days , \u201d Emanuel said .\nYou might be able to cultivate norms about mask-wearing in your workplace or organization , Chapman said , including by having a discussion beforehand in which everyone signs on to the idea of wearing a mask .\nIf you \u2019 re meeting up with a friend for a socially distanced coffee , Bloomfield said , set ground rules ahead of time and plan for both of you to wear face coverings . And if you live with someone , lay down rules and expectations for your communal living space . \u201c If you live in the same household , it \u2019 s not just your decisions affecting your own personal space \u2014 it \u2019 s affecting everyone \u2019 s space , \u201d she said .\nIf the person isn \u2019 t sold on wearing a mask , Bloomfield suggested asking them to just go along with it : \u201c Maybe I \u2019 m overreacting , but humor me \u2014 I \u2019 d rather be safe than sorry. \u201d \u201c You \u2019 re asking the person to compromise for your concerns and well-being , even if it \u2019 s not something they \u2019 re particularly concerned about , because you want to maintain the friendship or the relationship , \u201d she said .\n\u201c To a large extent , you can control what situation you \u2019 re in , \u201d Chapman said . \u201c You can leave the store or walk farther away from the person . You could make up whatever excuse you need to walk away from the situation . \u201d\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t have authority over the space , we can \u2019 t really tell people what they can and can not do , \u201d Bloomfield said . \u201c It \u2019 s best to just control your own well-being and what you feel comfortable with , and create the rules for your own spaces as best you can . \u201d\nConsider , Chapman added , that there are all sorts of situations not involving COVID-19 in which people have different approaches to risky situations . \u201c You might be somewhat judgmental of people who binge drink or don \u2019 t wear seat belts all the time , but you \u2019 re not going to be mortal enemies with them because of that \u2014 you \u2019 re going to try to protect yourself , \u201d she said .",
