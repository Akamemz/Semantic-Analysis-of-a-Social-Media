Mindless tribal affiliations , they say , drive our polarizations and prevent us from finding common ground . The greatest danger of tribalism , we are told , is that it morphs political leanings into social identities , creating political morass , gridlock , and decay .\nBut these pundits and policymakers have the story backwards . Indeed , we have enormous political challenges because we no longer value or know how to live like tribes : to make rules together , to develop consensus , to work out difficult problems without calling for outside help . In fact , tribes\u2014real tribes\u2014provide a great deal of meaning , community , and connection .

Tribes that had strong asabiyya could build strong empires , forge strong armies , and develop effective governance structures .

Yet , we would never know that if we looked at how tribes are described in modern parlance . Contemporary political \u201c tribalism \u201d is just the opposite of all of this . It is an ephemeral factionalism manifested in 280-character tweets or by an endless cycle of cable news pundits .\nThe problem is compounded by the abuse of the term \u201c tribes. \u201d Today , \u201c tribalism \u201d has become a basket category for our nasty state of affairs ; that is , the things we believe cause our increased polarization .
