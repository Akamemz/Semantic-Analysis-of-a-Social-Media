    "content": "COLUMBIA , S.C. \u2014 With just a few days until the South Carolina Democratic primary , Bernie Sanders is all but writing the state off .\nHe hasn \u2019 t said that , of course , but his schedule reflects it .\nSanders was in Massachusetts Monday night and Virginia Tuesday morning . While he attended a televised town hall in South Carolina Tuesday night and followed with an early morning news conference , his itinerary Wednesday consisted of events in Kansas City , Missouri , and Tulsa , Oklahoma . After that , his schedule called for a trip to Ohio Thursday \u2014 with stops in other March-voting states likely to be added , an aide said .\nA candidate \u2019 s time is a campaign \u2019 s most precious resource , so by spending so much of it somewhere other than South Carolina , the Sanders campaign is engaging in the cold calculus of primary politics \u2014 making the tough decision to send the senator to the states where he expects to be the most competitive .\nIt \u2019 s a reflection of the cloudy outlook in South Carolina \u2014 where Hillary Clinton currently holds a double-digit lead in every poll ahead of Saturday 's primary \u2014 but also of Sanders \u2019 strategic map through mid-March . The campaign 's goal is to project the message that he is running a durable national campaign , and central to that plan is a strong showing on Super Tuesday ( March 1 ) , followed by solid performances in big-state primaries like Michigan on March 8 and Ohio on March 15 .\nAsked whether he was writing the state off at his morning news conference \u2014 an opportunity for him to get into the local media stream before he headed off to Missouri \u2014 Sanders said `` Nooo , noo , no , no , no . ''\n`` We came to South Carolina , and , if you look at the polls , we were at 7 , 8 , 9 percent in the polls . We were 50 , 60 , 70 points behind . We have waged a very vigorous campaign . We have closed the gap very significantly , '' he said .\nNonetheless , he conceded , `` This , from Day One , was going to be a very difficult state for us . We 're not writing off South Carolina , but you all know there are a dozen states voting on March 1 . ''\nSanders and his aides bristle at the idea that they \u2019 re giving up on South Carolina , partly because they \u2019 ve invested in a large local organization for months . And because of Sanders \u2019 widely-publicized struggles courting African-American voters , they 're eager to avoid the perception that his choice to effectively stop campaigning in a state where black voters make up more than half of the Democratic primary electorate implies he 's ceding the black vote to Clinton all across the country .\n\u201c Bernie invested a lot of time and money , and has a sizable operation here . They \u2019 re certainly not skipping the state , \u201d said Brady Quirk-Garvan , chairman of the Charleston County Democratic Party . \u201c But it \u2019 s clear their focus is on Tuesday and moving forward past South Carolina . ''\nAfter barely mentioning South Carolina in his speech and communications to supporters upon losing Nevada on Saturday , Sanders was forced to face that question the next day on CBS \u2019 `` Face the Nation , '' insisting that he was not skipping the state .\n\u201c I \u2019 m talking to you from Columbia , South Carolina , we have a major rally this evening , we \u2019 re not skipping over anything , \u201d he told host John Dickerson Sunday , flashing some irritation at the implication . \u201c But I think that after South Carolina , we have 11 states , we stand a good chance of winning a number of those states . ''\nIndeed , the Sanders campaign is keeping surrogates \u2014 like actor and activist Danny Glover and former NAACP President Ben Jealous \u2014 in the state while maintaining its ads on the air and on the radio . And on Tuesday , the campaign released a spot featuring Spike Lee , as part of its effort to grow Sanders \u2019 share of the black vote .\nSanders himself held several South Carolina events Sunday . But in a sign of his deficit with the black voters who will likely decide the Democratic primary , the senator struggled to win attention amid a crowd of roughly 800 churchgoers at the largely black Brookland Baptist Church in West Columbia , even as Jealous tried to invoke Barack Obama \u2019 s historic 2008 campaign in his introduction . At his large , energetic rally in Greenville that night , the crowd was overwhelmingly white .\nMeanwhile , recognizing the political opportunity presented here , Clinton is re-doubling her efforts , plastering the state with campaign appearances and surrogate events over the rest of the week . She 's hoping to run up the score and come away with a considerable delegate lead .\n\u201c Not only is she spending a lot of time here , but the number of surrogates and the number of events they \u2019 re doing . You can \u2019 t cross the street without crossing a Hillary event , \u201d said Quirk-Garvan . \u201c They know they \u2019 re going to win , and this is about running up the score and having a decisive victory . ''\nThe former secretary of state \u2019 s team believes her plan to stay in South Carolina for the rest of the week will help her gain a big delegate margin from the state while allowing her to jump to other southern states \u2014 like Georgia on Friday \u2014 if she wants to shore up her support there ahead of March 1 .\nShe has the added benefit of former President Bill Clinton making the rounds for her in other key Super Tuesday states \u2014 Colorado , Oklahoma , and Texas so far this week , with a Virginia stop coming Wednesday .\nThat 's a tactic that the Sanders camp recognizes , but does n't have the luxury of pursuing . With Super Tuesday \u2014 when 11 states will hold Democratic contests \u2014 fast approaching , Sanders is merely engaging in a bit of political triage in South Carolina .\nHis campaign needs to perform well in the first half of March to stay competitive against Clinton .
