    "content": "As Donald Trump leads a full-scale war against the Republican establishment and elites , particularly through his attack on both their military ( Iraq ) and their trade ( NAFTA ) policies , the Democratic Party is also in a predicament that Bernie Sanders \u2019 candidacy is exposing . Both parties right now face a great crisis of leadership/ideology as well as a great opportunity for reinvention , and whichever party first reinvents itself successfully will begin winning elections the way the Democrats did in the 1932-1968 era .\nIf neither does , our nation faces a massive crisis provoked by the loss of democratic representation of the majority of the American electorate . Neither party today does much of anything for the bottom 90 % of Americans , as so clearly demonstrated by a recent study out of Princeton that showed that the likelihood of legislation passing that represents the interest of that bottom 90 % was equivalent , statistically , to white noise .\nThomas Frank \u2019 s new book Listen , Liberal : Or , Whatever Happened to the Party of the People ? offers the fascinating premise that starting with the McGovern Commission of 1972 ( which largely excommunicated Labor from having a large role in Democratic Party decision-making ) and going into a full-out embrace of the \u201c professional class \u201d \u2013 i.e . the top 10 % economically \u2013 the Democratic Party has largely abandoned the American working and middle class \u2013 the bottom 90 % .\nAs Frank told me on my program recently , the doctor who delivered me in 1951 was almost certainly a Republican ( then the party of the professional class ) , but today would almost certainly be a Democrat . In the 1950s and 1960s virtually the entire professional class ( the top 10 % ) was Republican ; today it \u2019 s virtually all Democratic .\nIn the late 1980s , the DLC Democrats ( and now the Third Way/Clinton Democrats ) embraced the professional class and embraced complex solutions to our nation \u2019 s problems . They consciously moved away from labor/working class and towards an elitist embrace of banksters , the emerging \u201c geniuses \u201d of Silicon Valley , and the college-educated at all levels .\nThey even went so far as to suggest it was a good thing that much of America \u2019 s blue-collar working-class high-school-diploma jobs go to China and Mexico , as we here in America needed to move to the \u201c new economy \u201d jobs of technology , medicine , and finance , requiring a college education .\nThis ideological change in the Party led to the Clinton-era 1990s policies that gutted our industrial base , ripped apart the social safety net ( ending \u201c the era of big government \u201d ) , and financialized our economy .\nAs Frank points out , while FDR had a \u201c brain trust \u201d of the best and the brightest in the nation , they were drawn from a broad cross-section of America in terms of class and education . Many didn \u2019 t even have a college education . The Clinton and Obama administrations , on the other hand , while optically more racially diverse , are almost entirely run by people with elite educations from elite universities ( particularly Harvard ) , who share the worldview of the DLC/Third Way .\nThe policies that came out of this new Democratic Party ideology ( largely taken from the 1950s Republicans ) have resulted in a boon for the professional class , but almost totally left behind the bottom 90 % .\nPresident Obama \u2019 s failure to even bring up Card Check ( the Employee Free Choice Act , which would have strengthened Labor ) , even after campaigning on it twice , is one of the most obvious examples of the Party \u2019 s decision to give lip service to working people , but keep their emphasis on elite complexity and the professional class that embodies it .\nThe result of these decisions and policies provided the opening for the most unlikely phenomenon ( on the Democratic side ) of my lifetime : a rumpled , acerbic , 74-year-old Jew with a Brooklyn accent who calls himself a \u201c Democratic Socialist \u201d drawing tens of thousands to stadiums across the nation and holding his own against the anointed candidate of the Democratic Party and Third Way elders .\nBernie Sanders carries into the Democratic Party the message of the bottom 90 % , the Occupy Movement , and the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 and the aspirations of students and working people \u2013 so successfully in large part because they \u2019 ve been abandoned by the Democratic Party elites ( including the Clinton dynasty ) .\nWhile Thomas Frank details brilliantly the reinvention ( and , probably , destruction ) of the modern Democratic Party , in my book The Crash of 2016 , I detail the parallel rise of the modern Republican Party , starting with the Powell Memo within a year of the McGovern Commission .\nPrior to the 1970s , business in America had been largely apolitical , preferring to focus instead on making money and running companies . But Powell convinced the Chamber of Commerce and a group of wealthy ideologues to change all that , and a group of billionaires and foundations rose to the call and created the huge and well-funded \u201c conservative \u201d infrastructure of think-tanks , media arms ( hate radio and Fox News ) , and the Koch Network .\nWithin a generation , the Party elites relied almost entirely on Big Business and Big Money to get elected , only throwing rhetorical bones to the bottom 90 % with their cynical \u201c god , guns , and gays \u201d strategy .\nThe result of those Republican decisions and policies ( many also embraced by the DLC/Third Way Democrats as well ) brought us the Gingrich-congress-pushed Phil Gramm-deregulation ( signed by Bill Clinton but opposed by most congressional Democrats ) that crashed the world economy ( and threatens to do it again any day now ) ; changes in tax and trade laws that let the rich get fabulously richer but flat-lined wages of blue-collar workers for two generations ; and an open revolt among Republicans in the form of the Tea Party and the Trump candidacy .\nWith both political parties captured almost entirely by the interest of the top 1 % ( Republicans ) and the top 10 % ( Democrats ) , the bottom 90 % feel they have nowhere else to go . For the past few decades , they \u2019 ve expressed this reality of being unrepresented by simply not voting and not showing up for politics , which they correctly saw as rigged and not working in their interest .\nNow , with both Trump and Sanders exposing complex trade deals as unwieldy and destructive to the bottom 90 % ( but very useful and enriching to the top 10 % ) , as well as the politically corrupt environment that supports the top 10 % , people on the right and the left are waking up .\nInterestingly , since the ( Democratic ) professional class includes elite-publication and TV journalists , they largely write off Sanders as an anachronism , a throwback to the FDR era which , they believe , was a nice and quaint memory but ain \u2019 t how the world works any more in this \u201c globalized economy . \u201d\nAs a result , they don \u2019 t cover the Sanders candidacy , except when Bernie supporters decide to show up at Trump rallies and start a confrontation that reaches the level of spectacle that they think qualifies it as \u201c news . \u201d\nSimilarly , as CBS chief executive Les Mooves so candidly pointed out at a recent stockholders meeting ( revealed to the world by the brilliant reporting of Lee Fang over at The Intercept ) , the most senior management of the big networks are more than happy to give almost $ 2 billion in free media to Republican Donald Trump because , as Mooves said , \u201c It may not be good for America , but it \u2019 s damn good for CBS\u2026 \u201d\nThus , whichever party embraces the 90 % will probably win the 2016 election .\nIf that \u2019 s Trump and/or Sanders , it \u2019 ll either splinter the Republican and/or Democratic Party or may reinvent that party in a way that it can begin to build and hold multigenerational national political power .\nIf Trump is the Republican nominee , he could well win as a change-candidate in a change-year against establishment-candidate Clinton .\nThe danger to our nation , though , is that Trump \u2019 s belligerent nationalism and militarism represents the same sort of sentiments of the 1930s European National Socialists , and could reform America in a really ugly way , even as he could maintain popularity by being the \u201c I \u2019 m here for the 90 % \u201d candidate by producing a few real social and economic reforms ( yes , the largest part of the early popularity of the European fascists in the 1930s was that they did real social reforms and rebuilt their nation \u2019 s respective infrastructures and middle classes ) .\nIf the 2016 reform candidate is on the Democratic side and it \u2019 s Bernie Sanders , he \u2019 ll almost certainly win against any non-Trump establishment Republican ( and could also easily beat Trump , according to the polls ) .
