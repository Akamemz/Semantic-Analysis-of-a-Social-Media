The deepest bowels of a recession?\n\n\u201cThere is much progress to report,\u201d he says, dreamily.\n\nTell that to the millions of Americans who are still unemployed.\n\nTell that to the broken taxpayers who have shouldered the burdens of all his bailouts and government schemes-gone-bust.\n\nTell that to the generations to come, for whom the American Dream has been sold downriver in order to pay for trillions of dollars in debt with which he has saddled them.\n\nEven with all the damage already done, a president without an agenda is a dead duck.\n\nAnd this president could not imagine an agenda that didn\u2019t cost a fortune of your money.\n\nSo he ticked off his list of projects to tackle in his second term from gun control to global warming to immigration to raising the minimum wage.\n\nIn case you are one of those mathy types out there wondering how much further into debt Mr. Obama will fling us to accomplish all this \u2014 well, don\u2019t you worry your silly little heads.\n\n\u201cNothing I\u2019m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime,\u201d Mr. Obama explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\u201d\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nOf course, when it comes to math, you got to watch what Mr. Obama says.
