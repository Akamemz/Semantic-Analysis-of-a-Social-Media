The Labor Department is expected in the coming weeks to release a rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime work \u2014 currently , all workers earning below $ 455 a week , or $ 23,660 a year , are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay for working more than 40 hours a week . The law may raise that as high as $ 52,000 , Politico reports .\nThe rule would also change the regulations outlining which employees earning above that threshold are eligible \u2014 currently , employers can exempt some employees above that threshold if those workers could be considered `` white collar . ''\nThis would add to a series of workplace policies that , failing congressional approval , the president has expanded in limited form through executive order \u2014 upping the minimum wage among federal contractors and attempting to shrink the gender wage gap among federal contractors . He also mandated paid leave for federal workers .\nThis particular rule change would be a long time in coming \u2014 Obama had in March 2014 directed the Labor Department to overhaul the overtime regulations .\nThe overtime threshold has only been changed once since 1975 . At that time , it was set at $ 250 per week . Then in 2004 , President George W. Bush updated it to $ 455 .
