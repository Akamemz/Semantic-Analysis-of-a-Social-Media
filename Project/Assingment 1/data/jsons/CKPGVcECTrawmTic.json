President Barack Obama \u2019 s \u201c reset \u201d policy with his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , was spurring major initiatives in cooperative diplomacy . Obama \u2019 s \u201c pivot \u201d away from the ancient conflicts in the Middle East to the dynamic opportunities for commerce and peace in the Pacific seemed promising . Threats to our security came less from rival nations than from shadowy terrorist groups , which our former rivals opposed as well . The few wars we were fighting involved local insurgencies and hadn \u2019 t metastasized into the wider proxy battles of earlier times .\nNow , as the decade roars to a finish , the world seems a very different place . Russia is once again a geostrategic foe . We \u2019 re locked in a trade war with China , whose expansionist aims\u2014long a matter of concern\u2014are clearer than ever . Regional conflicts , especially in the Middle East , are serving as chessboards for the competing ambitions of outside powers .\nThis transformation is only partly due to changes in leadership\u2014Obama to Donald Trump , Medvedev to Vladimir Putin , China \u2019 s Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping . What \u2019 s happening , in a larger context , is that global politics are reverting to form .\nWhen Putin invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014 , Obama \u2019 s secretary of state , John Kerry , blasted the move not merely as immoral and illegal but also as anachronistic , saying , \u201c You just don \u2019 t , in the 21st century , behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext. \u201d But , apparently , some countries do . Land grabs and power plays didn \u2019 t begin in the 19th century . ( Read Thucydides on the war between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century B.C . ) Nor , it seems , are they just yet relics of history .\nWhat specifically caused the relative calm at the decade \u2019 s start to slide into turmoil ? That calm , at least among the world \u2019 s big powers , was real . In 2010 , Obama and Medvedev signed the New START nuclear arms-reduction treaty . Obama also persuaded Medvedev to cancel a lucrative contract to sell Russia \u2019 s most modern air-defense missiles to Iran\u2014a move that stiffened the pressure on Tehran \u2019 s rulers to negotiate what became , five years later , the Iran nuclear deal . China seemed ready , at least in principle , to join in counterterrorism campaigns and to pressure its ally , North Korea , to stop developing nuclear weapons .\nThe chance of war with a major power seemed so remote that , for the first half of the decade , the U.S. Army suffered an existential crisis . Small-scale units , mainly special operations forces , were fighting insurgencies and advising allied militaries around the world , but the notion of large battles with tanks and artillery seemed absurd . Many serious officers wondered : What do we do with\u2014and do we really need\u2014a standing army of more than a half-million active-duty soldiers ?\nThen two things happened : Medvedev \u2019 s conciliatory leanings went too far , and Putin\u2014who had stepped down from president to prime minister but had never fully relinquished power\u2014stepped back up . A former KGB officer with a hankering for the glory days of the Soviet Union , Putin had long been nursing resentments over the West \u2019 s socioeconomic occupation of Russia and its shattered empire\u2014the flood of Western companies , economists , and cultural artifacts\u2014in the aftermath of the Cold War . President Bill Clinton had already gone too far in \u201c enlarging \u201d NATO right up to Russia \u2019 s borders . Ukraine , which Putin regarded as part of Russia , was drifting toward the European Union . Then , in 2011 , Medvedev voted to abstain from , rather than veto , a U.N. Security Council resolution to condemn Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi , one of Russia \u2019 s only stalwart allies in the Middle East . As a result , the West intervened and toppled Qaddafi , who , amid the chaos , was killed by rebels .\nPutin ran for president again in the next election ; Medvedev stood aside to let him win ; and Russia , which had regained much of its oil wealth since the USSR \u2019 s implosion , set about rebuilding its military and cracking down on dissent at home . The Soviet empire was forever vanished , but Putin was determined not to succumb any further to what he saw as American-led imperialism . In 2014 , after Ukraine \u2019 s pro-Moscow president , Viktor Yanukovych , fled Kyiv and Western-leaning politicians moved in , Putin annexed the Crimean peninsula\u2014which Nikita Khrushchev had given to Ukraine in 1954 . Soon after the annexation , Putin roused a secessionist movement in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbass , even moving Russian forces across the border to help the rebels .\nBoth of those moves marked the end of Obama \u2019 s \u201c reset. \u201d They also cheered many American officers . The Army once again had a familiar mission . The NATO alliance , which was experiencing its own identity crisis ( its new post\u2013Cold War mission , to serve as a global expeditionary force , hadn \u2019 t gone too well in Afghanistan ) , returned its gaze to deterring and preparing for possible conflict in Europe .\nThe upshot was this : The United States and Russia could still carve out areas of mutual interest\u2014arms control , counterterrorism , nuclear nonproliferation\u2014but the two nations were never cut out to be partners . Their conflicts of interest\u2014suppressed or submerged during the years of Russian weakness just after the end of the Cold War\u2014were too numerous and too deep to avoid , and after a while , the tensions spilled over to diplomatic forums as well .\nBut this was not a revival of the Cold War . Neither the United States nor Russia dominates an entire sphere of the planet . Nor do their armies face each other , in vast garrisons , across a contested border . Putin has gained strength mainly by exploiting fissures within the West , most notoriously through the \u201c information warfare \u201d of influencing public opinion during elections .\nChina too has built up its power through nonmilitary means , stealing high technology from the West , infusing it into its own products , and selling them\u2014while , at the same time , investing , mining , and manufacturing\u2014around the world : in short , by pursuing a purely mercantilist foreign policy , which President Xi calls the Belt and Road Initiative .\nXi has also built up China \u2019 s air force and navy , not to conquer distant lands ( he hopes his economic policies will do that ) , but rather as an \u201c area-denial \u201d strategy\u2014i.e. , to keep others , especially the U.S. military , from dominating the area around its borders . To extend the reach of its defenses , China has even constructed artificial islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and turned them into air bases .\nIn ordinary times , all this could have redounded to America \u2019 s benefit . Russia \u2019 s rumblings , earlier in the decade , roused European unity . China \u2019 s did the same with our allies in the Asia Pacific . Obama\u2014like Clinton and the two Bushes before him\u2014struck a balance , trying to lure Beijing into the global economy while containing its expansionist tendencies . In 2016 , he and 11 other leaders negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a trade deal that would have solidified the U.S. alliance in the region and formed a bulwark against China \u2019 s unfair practices .\nBut Donald Trump has squandered these opportunities . In a way that has flabbergasted his own officials , alienated the allies , and filled our revived adversaries with glee , he has eviscerated America \u2019 s influence in the world .\nFor reasons that no one has fully explained , he has often served Moscow \u2019 s interests : badmouthing NATO almost as intensely as any Kremlin commissar ever has , downgrading relations with Ukraine ( even before the famous phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky ) , and withdrawing the small contingent of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria . This last move allowed Russia to solidify its control over Syrian territory and set the stage for a power contest involving Russia , Syria , Turkey , Iran , and various jihadist and Kurdish militias that could intensify the region \u2019 s wildfires .\nYet for all his cooing over Putin , Trump has never come up with a strategy to leverage their putative friendship to America \u2019 s benefit . He could have worked out a deal to extend the New START treaty ( which expires in 2021 ) or to tighten the accords struck in the early part of the decade to lock up loose nuclear materials . But Trump is hostile to any treaty that was negotiated by Obama . So we all must deal with the consequences .\nTrump also did the opposite of exploiting the chance to cement alliances in Asia , not just in canceling the Trans-Pacific Partnership but also in launching the trade war against China , which has wound up hurting American farmers and manufacturers at least as much as it \u2019 s hurt China . ( A tougher economic policy against China was justified , especially in fighting intellectual property theft , but wholesale tariffs are misguided ; Trump seems unaware of the interlaced supply chain , in which many U.S. products contain Chinese parts . )\nAnd , as with Russia , Trump has no strategy for competing with China\u2014economically , diplomatically , or militarily . Meanwhile , Russia and China are doing all they can to extirpate themselves from the dollar-dominated global economy . ( This will take years , but they \u2019 re off to a good start . ) And large American companies , bereft of guidance from Washington and unable to do long-term planning in the face of Trump \u2019 s erratic tactics , are conceding to Chinese demands in order to preserve their bottom line . High-profile American emblems , from software firms to Hollywood studios to the NBA , are making these concessions . And the rest of the world watches ; they see which way the wind is blowing .\nSo where does this leave us ? The Cold War , which lasted roughly from 1947 to 1991 , was a time of dreadful danger and destructive \u201c small wars. \u201d But it was also a system of international security , at least for the nations that allied themselves , by choice or by force , with one of the two superpowers . When the Cold War ended , that system broke down with it . The first two presidents of the new era , Clinton and George W. Bush , didn \u2019 t do much to create a new system . Bush and his team didn \u2019 t think they needed to : America was \u201c the sole superpower , \u201d and it would reshape the world in its image . That proved to be fantasy .\nAt the start of this decade , Obama seemed aware of the need to construct a new system , and Medvedev seemed a plausible collaborator in the project . But its foundations were flimsy . A new system would have required new rules on permissible behavior , new treaties of cooperation , maybe the drawing of some new borders or power blocs , and much more lavish spending\u2014a new Marshall Plan of sorts\u2014to foster security and stability in areas that were no longer protected by a superpower and that might , therefore , relapse into the territorial and sectarian disputes that gripped them in decades and centuries before .\nNone of that happened . It would have taken visionaries , the likes of which we \u2019 ve rarely seen , to make it so . Instead , as we enter the third decade of the 21st century , we see the old , familiar patterns and ploys of international politics\u2014which John Kerry decried as \u201c 19th-century fashion \u201d but which , in fact , date back to antiquity . Only this time , they \u2019 re unspooling in a world that is as hyperconnected and lethal and disorderly as any that \u2019 s ever been seen .\nRead the rest of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s coverage of the end of the decade .",
