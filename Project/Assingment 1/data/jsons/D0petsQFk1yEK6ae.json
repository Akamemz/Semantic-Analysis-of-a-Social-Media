    "content": "Few names conjure the recalcitrant South , fighting integration with fire-breathing fury , like that of George Wallace . The central image of this \u201c redneck poltergeist , \u201d as one biographer referred to him , is of Wallace during his inauguration as governor of Alabama in January 1963 , before waves of applause and the rapt attention of the national media , committing himself to the perpetual defense of segregation . Speaking on a cold day in Montgomery , Wallace thundered his infamous call to arms : \u201c Today I have stood , where once Jefferson Davis stood , and took an oath to my people . It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy , this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland ... we sound the drum for freedom . ... In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth , I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny . . . and I say ... segregation now ... segregation tomorrow ... segregation forever ! \u201d\nThe story of dog whistle politics begins with George Wallace . But it does not start with Wallace as he stood that inauguration day . Rather , the story focuses on who Wallace was before , and on whom he quickly became .\nBefore that January day , Wallace had not been a rabid segregationist ; indeed , by Southern standards , Wallace had been a racial moderate . He had sat on the board of trustees of a prominent black educational enterprise , the Tuskegee Institute . He had refused to join the walkout of Southern delegates from the 1948 Democratic convention when they protested the adoption of a civil rights platform . As a trial court judge , he earned a reputation for treating blacks civilly\u2014a breach of racial etiquette so notable that decades later J.L . Chestnut , one of the very few black lawyers in Alabama at the time , would marvel that in 1958 \u201c George Wallace was the first judge to call me \u2018 Mr. \u2019 in a courtroom. \u201d The custom had been instead to condescendingly refer to all blacks by their first name , whatever their age or station . When Wallace initially ran for governor in 1958 , the NAACP endorsed him ; his opponent had the blessing of the Ku Klux Klan .\nIn the fevered atmosphere of the South , roiled by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision forbidding school segregation , the moderate Wallace lost in his first campaign for governor . Years later , the victor would reconstruct the campaign , distilling a simple lesson : the \u201c primary reason I beat [ Wallace ] was because he was considered soft on the race question at the time . That \u2019 s the primary reason. \u201d 4 This lesson was not lost on Wallace , and in turn , would reshape American politics for the next half-century . On the night he lost the 1958 election , Wallace sat in a car with his cronies , smoking a cigar , rehashing the loss , and putting off his concession speech . Finally steeling himself , Wallace eased opened the car door to go inside and break the news to his glum supporters . He wasn \u2019 t just going to accept defeat , though , he was going to learn from it . As he snuffed out his cigar and stepped into the evening , he turned back : \u201c Well , boys , \u201d he vowed , \u201c no other son-of-a-bitch will ever out-nigger me again . \u201d\nFour years later , Wallace ran as a racial reactionary , openly courting the support of the Klan and fiercely committing himself to the defense of segregation . It was as an arch-segregationist that Wallace won the right to stand for inauguration in January 1963 , allowing him to proclaim segregation today , tomorrow , and forever . Summarizing his first two campaigns for governor of Alabama , Wallace would later recall , \u201c you know , I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes\u2014and I couldn \u2019 t make them listen . Then I began talking about niggers\u2014and they stomped the floor . \u201d\nWallace was far from the only Southern politician to veer to the right on race in the 1950s . The mounting pressure for black equality destabilized a quiescent political culture that had assumed white supremacy was unassailable , putting pressure on all public persons to stake out their position for or against integration . Wallace figures here for a different reason , one that becomes clear in how he upheld his promise to protect segregation .\nDuring his campaign , Wallace had vowed to stand in schoolhouse doorways to personally bar the entrance of black students into white institutions .\nIn June 1963 , he got his chance . The federal courts had ordered the integration of the University of Alabama , Tuscaloosa , and US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach flew down from Washington , DC , to enforce the order . More than 200 national reporters and all three of the major broadcast networks were on hand for the promised confrontation . From behind a podium , Wallace stood in the June heat and raised his hand to peremptorily bar the approach of Katzenbach . Then he read a seven-minute peroration that avoided the red-meat language of racial supremacy and instead emphasized \u201c the illegal usurpation of power by the Central Government. \u201d In footage carried on all three networks , the nation watched as Wallace hectored Katzenbach , culminating with Wallace declaiming , \u201c I do hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the Central Government. \u201d 8 It was pure theater , even down to white lines chalked on the ground to show where the respective thespians should stand ( Katzenbach approached more closely than expected , but ultimately that only heightened the drama ) . Wallace knew from the start that he would back down , and after delivering his stem-winder , that is what he did . Within two hours , as expected , the University of Alabama \u2019 s first two black students were on campus .\nOver the next week , the nation reacted . More than 100,000 telegrams and letters flooded the office of the Alabama governor . More than half of them were from outside of the South . Did they condemn him ? Five out of every 100 did . The other 95 percent praised his brave stand in the schoolhouse doorway .\nThe nation \u2019 s reaction was an epiphany for Wallace , or perhaps better , three thunderbolts that together convinced Wallace to reinvent himself yet again . First , Wallace realized with a shock that hostility toward blacks was not confined to the South . \u201c He had looked out upon those white Americans north of Alabama and suddenly been awakened by a blinding vision : \u2018 They all hate black people , all of them . They \u2019 re all afraid , all of them . Great god ! That \u2019 s it ! They \u2019 re all Southern . The whole United States is Southern. \u2019 \u201d Wallace suddenly knew that overtures to racial resentment would resonate across the country .\nHis second startling realization was that he , George Wallace , had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity . The key lay in seemingly non-racial language . At his inauguration , Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland , thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck . Six months later , talking not about stopping integration but about states \u2019 rights and arrogant federal authority\u2014and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best\u2014Wallace was a countrywide hero . \u201c States \u2019 rights \u201d was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery . Then , as a rejoinder to the demand for integration , it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation\u2014a system of debasement so thorough that it \u201c extended to churches and schools , to housing and jobs , to eating and drinking ... to virtually all forms of public transportation , to sports and recreations , to hospitals , orphanages , prisons , and asylums , and ultimately to funeral homes , morgues , and cemeteries. \u201d That \u2019 s what \u201c states \u2019 rights \u201d defended , though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy . Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit , to others and perhaps even to themselves , their racial attitudes .\n\u201c Wallace pioneered a kind of soft porn racism in which fear and hate could be mobilized without mentioning race itself except to deny that one is a racist , \u201d a Wallace biographer argues . The notion of \u201c soft porn racism \u201d ties directly to the thesis of `` Dog Whistle Politics . '' Wallace realized the need to simultaneously move away from supremacist language that was increasingly unacceptable , while articulating a new vocabulary that channeled old , bigoted ideas . He needed a new form of racism that stimulated the intended audience without overtly transgressing prescribed social limits . The congratulatory telegrams from across the nation revealed to Wallace that he had found the magic formula . Hardcore racism showed white supremacy in disquieting detail . In contrast , the new soft porn racism hid any direct references to race , even as it continued to trade on racial stimulation . As a contemporary of Wallace marveled , \u201c he can use all the other issues\u2014law and order , running your own schools , protecting property rights\u2014and never mention race . But people will know he \u2019 s telling them \u2018 a nigger \u2019 s trying to get your job , trying to move into your neighborhood. \u2019 What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand , a kind of code . \u201d\nFinally , a third bolt of lightening struck Wallace : he could be the one ! The governor \u2019 s mansion in Montgomery need not represent his final destination . He could ride the train of revamped race-baiting all the way to the White House . Wallace ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1964 , and then again in 1968 , 1972 , and 1976 . It \u2019 s his 1968 campaign that most concerns us , for there Wallace ran against a consummate politician who was quick to appreciate , and adopt , Wallace \u2019 s refashioned racial demagoguery : Richard Nixon . We \u2019 ll turn to the Wallace-Nixon race soon , but first , another set of weathered bones must be excavated\u2014the remains of Barry Goldwater .\nThe Republican Party today , in its voters and in its elected officials , is almost all white . But it wasn \u2019 t always like that . Indeed , in the decades immediately before 1964 , neither party was racially identified in the eyes of the American public . Even as the Democratic Party on the national level increasingly embraced civil rights , partly as a way to capture the growing political power of blacks who had migrated to Northern cities , Southern Democrats\u2014like George Wallace\u2014 remained staunch defenders of Jim Crow . Meanwhile , among Republicans , the racial antipathies of the rightwing found little favor among many party leaders . To take an important example , Brown and its desegregation imperative were backed by Republicans : Chief Justice Earl Warren , who wrote the opinion , was a Republican , and the first troops ordered into the South in 1957 to protect black students attempting to integrate a white school were sent there by the Republican administration of Dwight Eisenhower and his vice president , Richard Nixon . Reflecting the roughly equal commitment of both parties to racial progress , even as late as 1962 , the public perceived Republicans and Democrats to be similarly committed to racial justice . In that year , when asked which party \u201c is more likely to see that Negroes get fair treatment in jobs and housing , \u201d 22.7 percent of the public said Democrats and 21.3 percent said Republicans , while over half could perceive no difference between the two .\nThe 1964 presidential election marked the beginning of the realignment we live with today . Where in 1962 both parties were perceived as equally , if tepidly , supportive of civil rights , two years later 60 percent of the public identified Democrats as more likely to pursue fair treatment , versus only 7 percent who so identified the Republican Party . What happened ?\nGroundwork for the shift was laid in the run-up to the 1964 election by rightwing elements in the Republican Party , which gained momentum from the loss of the then-moderate Nixon to John F. Kennedy in 1960 . This faction of the party had never stopped warring against the New Deal . Its standard bearer was Barry Goldwater , a senator from Arizona and heir to a department store fortune . His pampered upbringing and wealth notwithstanding , Goldwater affected a cowboy \u2019 s rough-and-tumble persona in his dress and speech , casting himself as a walking embodiment of the Marlboro Man \u2019 s disdain for the nanny state . Goldwater and the reactionary stalwarts who rallied to him saw the Democratic Party as a mortal threat to the nation : domestically , because of the corrupting influence of a powerful central government deeply involved in regulating the marketplace and using taxes to reallocate wealth downward , and abroad in its willingness to compromise with communist countries instead of going to war against them . Goldwater himself , though , was no racial throwback . For instance , in 1957 and again in 1960 he voted in favor of federal civil rights legislation . By 1961 , however , Goldwater and his partisans had become convinced that the key to electoral success lay in gaining ground in the South , and that in turn required appealing to racist sentiments in white voters , even at the cost of black support . As Goldwater drawled , \u201c We \u2019 re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 and 1968 , so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are . \u201d\nThis racial plan riled more moderate members of the Republican establishment , such as New York senator Jacob Javits , who in the fall of 1963 may have been the first to refer to a \u201c Southern Strategy \u201d in the context of repudiating it . By then , however , the right wing of the party had won out . As the conservative journalist Robert Novak reported after attending a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Denver during the summer of 1963 : \u201c A good many , perhaps a majority of the party \u2019 s leadership , envision substantial political gold to be mined in the racial crisis by becoming in fact , though not in name , the White Man \u2019 s Party . \u2018 Remember , \u2019 one astute party worker said quietly . . . \u2018 this isn \u2019 t South Africa . The white man outnumbers the Negro 9 to 1 in this country. \u2019 \u201d The rise of a racially-identified GOP is not a tale of latent bigotry in that party . It is instead a story centered on the strategic decision to use racism to become \u201c the White Man \u2019 s Party . \u201d\nThat same summer of 1963 , as key Republican leaders strategized on how to shift their party to the far right racially , the Democrats began to lean in the other direction . Northern constituents were increasingly appalled by the violence , shown almost nightly on broadcast television , of Southern efforts to beat down civil rights protesters . Reacting to the growing clamor that something be done , President Kennedy introduced a sweeping civil rights bill that stirred the hopes of millions that segregation would soon be illegal in employment and at business places open to the public . Despite these hopes , however , prospects for the bill \u2019 s passage seemed dim , as the Southern Democrats were loath to support civil rights and retained sufficient power to bottle up the bill . Then on November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated . His vice president , Lyndon Johnson , assumed the presidency vowing to make good on Kennedy \u2019 s priorities , chief among them civil rights . Only five days after Kennedy \u2019 s death , Johnson in his first address to Congress implored the assembly that \u201c no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy \u2019 s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. \u201d Even under these conditions , it took Johnson \u2019 s determined stewardship to overcome three months of dogged legislative stalling before Kennedy \u2019 s civil rights bill finally passed the next summer . Known popularly as the 1964 Civil Rights Act , it still stands as the greatest civil rights achievement of the era .\nIndicating the persistence of the old , internally divided racial politics of both parties , the act passed with broad bipartisan support and against broad bipartisan opposition\u2014the cleavage was regional , rather than in terms of party affiliation . Roughly 90 percent of non-Southern senators supported the bill , while 95 percent of Southern senators opposed it . Yet , heralding the incipient emergence of the new politics of party alignment along racial lines , Barry Goldwater also voted against the civil rights bill . He was one of only five senators from outside the South to do so . Goldwater claimed he saw a looming Orwellian state moving to coerce private citizens to spy on each other for telltale signs of racism . \u201c To give genuine effect to the prohibitions of this bill , \u201d Goldwater contended from the Senate floor , \u201c bids fair to result in the development of an \u2018 informer \u2019 psychology in great areas of our national life\u2014neighbor spying on neighbor , workers spying on workers , businessmen spying on businessmen. \u201d This all seemed a little hysterical . More calculatingly , it could not have escaped Goldwater \u2019 s attention that voting against a civil rights law associated with blacks , Kennedy , and Johnson would help him \u201c go hunting where the ducks are . \u201d\nRunning for president in 1964 , the Arizonan strode across the South , hawking small-government bromides and racially coded appeals . In terms of the latter , he sold his vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bold stand in favor of \u201c states \u2019 rights \u201d and \u201c freedom of association. \u201d States \u2019 rights , Goldwater insisted , preserved state autonomy against intrusive meddling from a distant power\u2014though obviously the burning issue of the day was the federal government \u2019 s efforts to limit state involvement in racial degradation and group oppression . Freedom of association , Goldwater explained , meant the right of individuals to be free from government coercion in choosing whom to let onto their property\u2014but in the South this meant first and foremost the right of business owners to exclude blacks from hotels , restaurants , movie theaters , and retail establishments . Like Wallace , Goldwater had learned how to talk about blacks without ever mentioning race .\nNo less than Wallace , Goldwater also demonstrated a flair for political stagecraft . A reporter following Goldwater \u2019 s campaign through the South captured some of the spectacle : \u201c to show the country the \u2018 lily-white \u2019 character of Republicanism in Dixie , \u201d party flaks filled the floor of the football stadium in Montgomery , Alabama , with \u201c a great field of white lilies\u2014living lilies , in perfect bloom , gorgeously arrayed. \u201d To this tableau , the campaign added \u201c seven hundred Alabama girls in long white gowns , all of a whiteness as impossible as the greenness of the field. \u201d Onto this scene emerged Goldwater , first moving this way and then that way through \u201c fifty or so yards of choice Southern womanhood , \u201d before taking the stand to give his speech defending states \u2019 rights and freedom of association . If these coded terms were too subtle for some , no one could fail to grasp the symbolism of the white lilies and the white-gowned women . Much of the emotional resistance to racial equality centered around the fear that black men would become intimate with white women . This scene represented \u201c what the rest of his Southern troops\u2014the thousands in the packed stands , the tens of thousands in Memphis and New Orleans and Atlanta and Shreveport and Greenville\u2014passionately believed they were defending. \u201d Goldwater made sure white Southerners understood he was fighting to protect them and their women against blacks .\nHow would Goldwater fare in the South ? Beyond his racial pandering , that depended on how his anti-New Deal message was received . The Great Depression had devastated the region , which lagged behind the North in industry . Federal assistance to the poor as well as major infrastructure projects , such as the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) that brought electricity for the first time to millions , made Southerners among the New Deal \u2019 s staunchest supporters . Yet despite the New Deal \u2019 s popularity in the South , Goldwater campaigned against it . While he was willing to pander racially , Goldwater also prided himself on telling audiences what he thought they needed to hear , at least as far as the bracing virtues of rugged individualism were concerned . Thus he made clear , for instance , that he favored selling off the TVA , and also attacked other popular programs . As recounted by Rick Perlstein , a Goldwater political biographer , at one rally in West Virginia , Goldwater \u201c called the War on Poverty \u2018 plainly and simply a war on your pocketbooks , \u2019 a fraud because only \u2018 the vast resources of private business \u2019 could produce the wealth to truly slay penury. \u201d Perlstein singled out the tin-eared cruelty of this message : \u201c In the land of the tar-paper shack , the gap-toothed smile , and the open sewer\u2014where the \u2018 vast resources of private business \u2019 were represented in the person of the coal barons who gave men black lung , then sent them off to die without pensions\u2014the message just sounded perverse . As he left , lines of workmen jeered him . \u201d\nAnother factor also worked against Goldwater : he was a Republican , and the South reviled the Party of Lincoln . If across the nation neither party was seen as more or less friendly toward civil rights , the South had its own views on the question . There , it was the local Democratic machine that represented white interests , while the GOP was seen as the proximate cause of the Civil War and as the party of the carpetbaggers who had peremptorily ruled the South during Reconstruction . The hostility of generations of white Southerners toward Republicans only intensified with the Republican Eisenhower \u2019 s decision to send in federal troops to enforce the Republican Warren \u2019 s ruling forbidding school segregation in Brown . Most white Southerners had never voted Republican in their lives , and had vowed\u2014like their parents and grandparents before them\u2014 that they never would .\nUltimately , however , these handicaps barely impeded Goldwater \u2019 s performance in the South . He convinced many Southern voters to vote Republican for the first time ever , and in the Deep South , comprised of those five states with the highest black populations , Goldwater won outright . The anti-New Deal Republican carried Louisiana , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina , states in which whites had never voted for a Republican president in more than miniscule numbers . This was a shocking transformation , one that can only be explained by Goldwater \u2019 s ability to transmit a set of codes that white voters readily understood as a promise to protect racial segregation . It seemed that voters simply ignored Goldwater \u2019 s philosophy of governance as well as his party affiliation and instead rewarded his hostility toward civil rights . In this sense , Goldwater \u2019 s conservatism operated in the South less like a genuine political ideology and more like Wallace \u2019 s soft porn racism : as a set of codes that voters readily understood as defending white supremacy . Goldwater didn \u2019 t win the South as a small-government libertarian , but rather as a racist .\nIf in the South race trumped anti-government politics , in the North Goldwater \u2019 s anti-civil rights attacks found much less traction . Opposing civil rights smacked too much of Southern intransigence , and while there was resistance to racial reform in the North , it had not yet become an overriding issue for many whites . That left Goldwater running on promises to end the New Deal , and this proved wildly unpopular . To campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to campaign against an activist government that had lifted the country out of the throes of a horrendous depression still squarely in the rear view mirror , and that had then launched millions into the middle class . More than that , though , to campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to attack government programs still largely aimed at whites\u2014and that sort of welfare was broadly understood as legitimate and warranted\nGoldwater \u2019 s anti-welfare tirades produced a landslide victory , but for Lyndon Johnson . Voters crushed Goldwater \u2019 s last-gasp attack on the New Deal state . Outside of the South , he lost by overwhelming numbers in every state except his Arizona home . Voters were offended by his over-the-top attacks on popular New Deal programs as well as by his penchant for saber rattling when it came to foreign policy . Goldwater especially suffered after the release of \u201c Daisy , \u201d a Johnson campaign ad that juxtaposed a little girl picking the petals off a flower with footage of a spiraling mushroom cloud , sending the message that Goldwater \u2019 s militarism threatened nuclear Armageddon . In the end , the Democrats succeeded in making Goldwater look like a loon . \u201c To the Goldwater slogan \u2018 In Your Heart , You Know He \u2019 s Right , \u2019 the Democrats shot back , \u2018 In Your Guts , You Know He \u2019 s Nuts. \u2019 \u201d The country as a whole , it seemed , had solidly allied itself with progressive governance , and big-money/small-government conservatism was finally , utterly dead .\nOr at least , this was the lesson most people took from the 1964 election . But like the clang of a distant alarm barely perceptible against the buzzing din of consensus , a warning was rising from the South : racial entreaties had convinced even the staunchest Democrats to abandon New Deal liberalism . If race-baiting had won over Southern whites to anti-government politics , could the same work across the country ?\nNotwithstanding the emerging racial strategy initiated by Goldwater , when Richard Nixon secured the Republican nomination in 1968 , the new racial politics of his party had not yet gelled , either within the party generally , or in Nixon himself . Indeed , the moderate Nixon \u2019 s emergence as the party \u2019 s presidential candidate reflected the extent to which the Goldwater faction had lost credibility in the wake of their champion \u2019 s disastrous drubbing . Nevertheless , the dynamics of the presidential race would quickly push Nixon toward race-baiting . Nixon \u2019 s principal opponent in 1968 was Johnson \u2019 s vice president , Hubert Humphrey . But running as an independent candidate , George Wallace was flanking Nixon on the right . By October 1 , just a month before the election , Wallace was polling more support in the South than either Humphrey or Nixon . Nor was his support limited to that region . Wallace was siphoning crucial votes across the country , and staging massive rallies in ostensibly liberal strongholds , for instance drawing 20,000 partisans to Madison Square Garden in New York , and 70,000 faithful to the Boston Common\u2014more than any rally ever held by the Kennedys , Wallace liked to crow . Republican operatives guessed that perhaps 80 percent of the Wallace voters in the South would otherwise support Nixon , and a near-majority in the North as well .\nLate in the campaign , Nixon opted to publicly tack right on race . He had already reached a backroom deal with South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond\u2014 an arch-segregationist who had led the revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948 when it endorsed a modest civil rights plank , and who switched to become a Republican in 1964 to throw his weight behind Goldwater . Nixon bought Thurmond \u2019 s support during the primary season by secretly promising that he would restrict federal enforcement of school desegregation in the South . Now he would make this same promise to the nation . On October 7 , Nixon came out against \u201c forced busing , \u201d an increasingly potent euphemism for the system of transporting students across the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods in order to integrate schools . Mary Frances Berry pierces the pretense that the issue was putting one \u2019 s child on a bus : \u201c African-American attempts to desegregate schools were confronted by white flight and complaints that the problem was not desegregation , but busing , oftentimes by people who sent their children to school every day on buses , including mediocre white private academies established to avoid integration. \u201d \u201c Busing \u201d offered a Northern analog to states \u2019 rights . The language may have referred to transportation , but the emotional wallop came from defiance toward integration .\nNixon also began to hammer away at the issue of law and order . In doing so , he drew upon a rhetorical frame rooted in Southern resistance to civil rights . From the inception of the civil rights movement in the 1950s , Southern politicians had disparaged racial activists as \u201c lawbreakers , \u201d as indeed technically they were . In the Jim Crow regions , African Americans had long pressed basic equality demands precisely by breaking laws mandating segregation : sit-ins and freedom rides purposefully violated Jim Crow statutes in order to challenge white supremacist social norms . Dismissing these protesters as criminals shifted the issue from a defense of white supremacy to a more neutral-seeming concern with \u201c order , \u201d while simultaneously stripping the activists of moral stature . Demonstrators were no longer Americans willing to risk beatings and even death for a grand ideal , but rather criminal lowlifes disposed toward antisocial behavior . Ultimately , the language of law and order justified a more \u201c quiet \u201d form of violence in defense of the racial status quo , replacing lynchings with mass arrests for trespassing and delinquency .\nNixon had mastered Wallace \u2019 s dark art . Forced bussing , law and order , and security from unrest as the essential civil right of the majority\u2014all of these were coded phrases that allowed Nixon to appeal to racial fears without overtly mentioning race at all . Yet race remained the indisputable , intentional subtext of the appeal . As Nixon exulted after watching one of his own commercials : \u201c Yep , this hits it right on the nose . . . it \u2019 s all about law and order and the damn Negro-Puerto Rican groups out there . \u201d\nNixon didn \u2019 t campaign exclusively on racial themes ; notably , he also stressed his opposition to anti-war protesters , while simultaneously portraying himself as the candidate most likely to bring the war to an end . Nevertheless , racial appeals formed an essential element of Nixon \u2019 s \u2019 68 campaign . Nixon \u2019 s special counsel , John Ehrlichman , bluntly summarized that year \u2019 s campaign strategy : \u201c We \u2019 ll go after the racists. \u201d According to Ehrlichman , the \u201c subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon \u2019 s statements and speeches . \u201d\nNixon barely won in 1968 , edging Humphrey by less than one percent of the national vote . Wallace , meanwhile , had captured nearly 14 percent of the vote . Had Nixon \u2019 s coded race-baiting helped ? Initially there was uncertainty , and in his first two years in office Nixon governed as if he still believed the federal government had some role to play in helping out nonwhites . For instance , Nixon came into office proposing the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor , which would have gone a long way toward breaking down racial inequalities . But over the course of those two years , a new understanding consolidated regarding the tidal shift that had occurred .\nOn the Democratic side , in 1970 two pollsters , Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg , published The Real Majority , cautioning their party that \u201c Social Issues \u201d now divided the base . \u201c The machinist \u2019 s wife in Dayton may decide to leave the Democratic reservation in 1972 and vote for Nixon or Wallace or their ideological descendants , \u201d Scammon and Wattenberg warned . \u201c If she thinks the Democrats feel that she isn \u2019 t scared of crime but that she \u2019 s really a bigot , if she thinks that Democrats feel the police are Fascist pigs and the Black Panthers and the Weathermen are just poor , misunderstood , picked-upon kids , if she thinks that Democrats are for the hip drug culture and that she , the machinist \u2019 s wife , is not only a bigot , but a square , then good-bye lady\u2014and good-bye Democrats. \u201d How , then , could the party get ahead of these issues ? Scammon and Wattenberg were frank : \u201c The Democrats in the South were hurt by being perceived ( correctly ) as a pro-black national party. \u201d The solution was clear : the Democratic Party had to temper its \u201c pro-black stance . \u201d\nOn the Republican side , a leading Nixon strategist had come to the same conclusion about race as a potential wedge issue\u2014though , predictably , with a different prescription . In 1969 , Kevin Phillips published The Emerging Republican Majority , arguing that because of racial resentments a historical realignment was underway that would cement a new Republican majority that would endure for decades . A young prodigy obsessed with politics , Phillips had worked out the details of his argument in the mid-1960s , and then had gone to work helping to elect Nixon . When the 1968 returns seemed to confirm his thesis , he published his research\u2014nearly 500 pages , with 47 maps and 143 charts . Beneath the details , Phillips had a simple , even deterministic thesis : \u201c Historically , our party system has reflected layer upon layer of group oppositions. \u201d Politics , according to Phillips , turned principally on group animosity\u2014 \u201c the prevailing cleavages in American voting behavior have been ethnic and cultural . Politically , at least , the United States has not been a very effective melting pot . \u201d\nAs to what was driving the latest realignment , Phillips was blunt : \u201c The Negro problem , having become a national rather than a local one , is the principal cause of the breakup of the New Deal coalition. \u201d For Phillips , it was almost inevitable that most whites would abandon the Democratic Party once it became identified with blacks . \u201c Ethnic and cultural division has so often shaped American politics that , given the immense midcentury impact of Negro enfranchisement and integration , reaction to this change almost inevitably had to result in political realignment. \u201d Phillips saw his emerging Republican majority this way : \u201c the nature of the majority\u2014or potential majority\u2014seems clear . It is largely white and middle class . It is concentrated in the South , the West , and suburbia . \u201d\nThe number crunchers had spoken . The Southern strategy , incipient for a decade , had matured into a clear route to electoral dominance . The old Democratic alliance of Northeastern liberals , the white working class , Northern blacks , and Southern Democrats , could be riven by racial appeals . Beginning in 1970 , Richard Nixon embraced the politics of racial division wholeheartedly . He abandoned the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor . Now , Nixon repeatedly emphasized law and order issues . He railed against forced busing in the North . He reversed the federal government \u2019 s position on Southern school integration , slowing the process down and making clear that the courts would have no help from his administration . But perhaps nothing symbolized the new Nixon more than his comments in December 1970 . Reflecting his initially moderate position on domestic issues , early in his administration Nixon had appointed George Romney\u2014a liberal Republican and , incidentally , Mitt Romney \u2019 s father\u2014as his secretary of housing and urban development . In turn , Romney had made integration of the suburbs his special mission , even coming up with a plan to cut off federal funds to communities that refused to allow integrated housing . By late 1970 , however , when these jurisdictions howled at the temerity , Nixon took their side , throwing his cabinet officer under the bus . In a public address , Nixon baldly stated : \u201c I can assure you that it is not the policy of this government to use the power of the federal government . . . for forced integration of the suburbs . I believe that forced integration of the suburbs is not in the national interest. \u201d 41 That dog whistle blasted like the shriek of an onrushing train .\nIn 1963 , Robert Novak had written that many Republican leaders were intent on converting the Party of Lincoln into the White Man \u2019 s Party . The following year , Goldwater went down in crushing defeat , winning only 36 percent of the white vote . Even so , less than a decade later , the racial transmogrification of the Republicans was well underway . In 1972 , Nixon \u2019 s first full dog whistle campaign netted him 67 percent of the white vote , leaving his opponent , George McGovern , with support from less than one in three whites . Defeated by the Southern strategy , McGovern neatly summed it up : \u201c What is the Southern Strategy ? It is this . It says to the South : Let the poor stay poor , let your economy trail the nation , forget about decent homes and medical care for all your people , choose officials who will oppose every effort to benefit the many at the expense of the few\u2014and in return , we will try to overlook the rights of the black man , appoint a few southerners to high office , and lift your spirits by attacking the \u2018 eastern establishment \u2019 whose bank accounts we are filling with your labor and your industry. \u201d 42 McGovern erred in supposing that the Southern strategy pertained only to the South . Nixon had already learned from Wallace , and then later from the number crunchers , that coded racial appeals would work nationwide . Other than that , especially in its class and race dimensions , McGovern had dog whistle politics dead to rights .\nExcerpted from `` Dog Whistle Politics : How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class '' by Ian Haney L\u00f3pez .

    "content_original": "Few names conjure the recalcitrant South, fighting integration with fire-breathing fury, like that of George Wallace. The central image of this \u201credneck poltergeist,\u201d as one biographer referred to him, is of Wallace during his inauguration as governor of Alabama in January 1963, before waves of applause and the rapt attention of the national media, committing himself to the perpetual defense of segregation. Speaking on a cold day in Montgomery, Wallace thundered his infamous call to arms: \u201cToday I have stood, where once Jefferson Davis stood, and took an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland ... we sound the drum for freedom. ... In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny . . . and I say ... segregation now ... segregation tomorrow ... segregation forever!\u201d\n\nThe story of dog whistle politics begins with George Wallace. But it does not start with Wallace as he stood that inauguration day. Rather, the story focuses on who Wallace was before, and on whom he quickly became.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBefore that January day, Wallace had not been a rabid segregationist; indeed, by Southern standards, Wallace had been a racial moderate. He had sat on the board of trustees of a prominent black educational enterprise, the Tuskegee Institute. He had refused to join the walkout of Southern delegates from the 1948 Democratic convention when they protested the adoption of a civil rights platform. As a trial court judge, he earned a reputation for treating blacks civilly\u2014a breach of racial etiquette so notable that decades later J.L. Chestnut, one of the very few black lawyers in Alabama at the time, would marvel that in 1958 \u201cGeorge Wallace was the first judge to call me \u2018Mr.\u2019 in a courtroom.\u201d The custom had been instead to condescendingly refer to all blacks by their first name, whatever their age or station. When Wallace initially ran for governor in 1958, the NAACP endorsed him; his opponent had the blessing of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn the fevered atmosphere of the South, roiled by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision forbidding school segregation, the moderate Wallace lost in his first campaign for governor. Years later, the victor would reconstruct the campaign, distilling a simple lesson: the \u201cprimary reason I beat [Wallace] was because he was considered soft on the race question at the time. That\u2019s the primary reason.\u201d4 This lesson was not lost on Wallace, and in turn, would reshape American politics for the next half-century. On the night he lost the 1958 election, Wallace sat in a car with his cronies, smoking a cigar, rehashing the loss, and putting off his concession speech. Finally steeling himself, Wallace eased opened the car door to go inside and break the news to his glum supporters. He wasn\u2019t just going to accept defeat, though, he was going to learn from it. As he snuffed out his cigar and stepped into the evening, he turned back: \u201cWell, boys,\u201d he vowed, \u201cno other son-of-a-bitch will ever out-nigger me again.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Wallace ran as a racial reactionary, openly courting the support of the Klan and fiercely committing himself to the defense of segregation. It was as an arch-segregationist that Wallace won the right to stand for inauguration in January 1963, allowing him to proclaim segregation today, tomorrow, and forever. Summarizing his first two campaigns for governor of Alabama, Wallace would later recall, \u201cyou know, I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes\u2014and I couldn\u2019t make them listen. Then I began talking about niggers\u2014and they stomped the floor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWallace was far from the only Southern politician to veer to the right on race in the 1950s. The mounting pressure for black equality destabilized a quiescent political culture that had assumed white supremacy was unassailable, putting pressure on all public persons to stake out their position for or against integration. Wallace figures here for a different reason, one that becomes clear in how he upheld his promise to protect segregation.\n\nDuring his campaign, Wallace had vowed to stand in schoolhouse doorways to personally bar the entrance of black students into white institutions.\n\nIn June 1963, he got his chance. The federal courts had ordered the integration of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, and US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach flew down from Washington, DC, to enforce the order. More than 200 national reporters and all three of the major broadcast networks were on hand for the promised confrontation. From behind a podium, Wallace stood in the June heat and raised his hand to peremptorily bar the approach of Katzenbach. Then he read a seven-minute peroration that avoided the red-meat language of racial supremacy and instead emphasized \u201cthe illegal usurpation of power by the Central Government.\u201d In footage carried on all three networks, the nation watched as Wallace hectored Katzenbach, culminating with Wallace declaiming, \u201cI do hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the Central Government.\u201d8 It was pure theater, even down to white lines chalked on the ground to show where the respective thespians should stand (Katzenbach approached more closely than expected, but ultimately that only heightened the drama). Wallace knew from the start that he would back down, and after delivering his stem-winder, that is what he did. Within two hours, as expected, the University of Alabama\u2019s first two black students were on campus.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOver the next week, the nation reacted. More than 100,000 telegrams and letters flooded the office of the Alabama governor. More than half of them were from outside of the South. Did they condemn him? Five out of every 100 did. The other 95 percent praised his brave stand in the schoolhouse doorway.\n\nThe nation\u2019s reaction was an epiphany for Wallace, or perhaps better, three thunderbolts that together convinced Wallace to reinvent himself yet again. First, Wallace realized with a shock that hostility toward blacks was not confined to the South. \u201cHe had looked out upon those white Americans north of Alabama and suddenly been awakened by a blinding vision: \u2018They all hate black people, all of them. They\u2019re all afraid, all of them. Great god! That\u2019s it! They\u2019re all Southern. The whole United States is Southern.\u2019\u201d Wallace suddenly knew that overtures to racial resentment would resonate across the country.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHis second startling realization was that he, George Wallace, had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity. The key lay in seemingly non-racial language. At his inauguration, Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland, thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck. Six months later, talking not about stopping integration but about states\u2019 rights and arrogant federal authority\u2014and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best\u2014Wallace was a countrywide hero. \u201cStates\u2019 rights\u201d was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery. Then, as a rejoinder to the demand for integration, it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation\u2014a system of debasement so thorough that it \u201cextended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs, to eating and drinking ... to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asylums, and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.\u201d That\u2019s what \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d defended, though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy. Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit, to others and perhaps even to themselves, their racial attitudes.\n\n\u201cWallace pioneered a kind of soft porn racism in which fear and hate could be mobilized without mentioning race itself except to deny that one is a racist,\u201d a Wallace biographer argues. The notion of \u201csoft porn racism\u201d ties directly to the thesis of \"Dog Whistle Politics.\" Wallace realized the need to simultaneously move away from supremacist language that was increasingly unacceptable, while articulating a new vocabulary that channeled old, bigoted ideas. He needed a new form of racism that stimulated the intended audience without overtly transgressing prescribed social limits. The congratulatory telegrams from across the nation revealed to Wallace that he had found the magic formula. Hardcore racism showed white supremacy in disquieting detail. In contrast, the new soft porn racism hid any direct references to race, even as it continued to trade on racial stimulation. As a contemporary of Wallace marveled, \u201che can use all the other issues\u2014law and order, running your own schools, protecting property rights\u2014and never mention race. But people will know he\u2019s telling them \u2018a nigger\u2019s trying to get your job, trying to move into your neighborhood.\u2019 What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand, a kind of code.\u201d\n\nFinally, a third bolt of lightening struck Wallace: he could be the one! The governor\u2019s mansion in Montgomery need not represent his final destination. He could ride the train of revamped race-baiting all the way to the White House. Wallace ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1964, and then again in 1968, 1972, and 1976. It\u2019s his 1968 campaign that most concerns us, for there Wallace ran against a consummate politician who was quick to appreciate, and adopt, Wallace\u2019s refashioned racial demagoguery: Richard Nixon. We\u2019ll turn to the Wallace-Nixon race soon, but first, another set of weathered bones must be excavated\u2014the remains of Barry Goldwater.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Rise of Racially Identified Parties\n\nThe Republican Party today, in its voters and in its elected officials, is almost all white. But it wasn\u2019t always like that. Indeed, in the decades immediately before 1964, neither party was racially identified in the eyes of the American public. Even as the Democratic Party on the national level increasingly embraced civil rights, partly as a way to capture the growing political power of blacks who had migrated to Northern cities, Southern Democrats\u2014like George Wallace\u2014 remained staunch defenders of Jim Crow. Meanwhile, among Republicans, the racial antipathies of the rightwing found little favor among many party leaders. To take an important example, Brown and its desegregation imperative were backed by Republicans: Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the opinion, was a Republican, and the first troops ordered into the South in 1957 to protect black students attempting to integrate a white school were sent there by the Republican administration of Dwight Eisenhower and his vice president, Richard Nixon. Reflecting the roughly equal commitment of both parties to racial progress, even as late as 1962, the public perceived Republicans and Democrats to be similarly committed to racial justice. In that year, when asked which party \u201cis more likely to see that Negroes get fair treatment in jobs and housing,\u201d 22.7 percent of the public said Democrats and 21.3 percent said Republicans, while over half could perceive no difference between the two.\n\nThe 1964 presidential election marked the beginning of the realignment we live with today. Where in 1962 both parties were perceived as equally, if tepidly, supportive of civil rights, two years later 60 percent of the public identified Democrats as more likely to pursue fair treatment, versus only 7 percent who so identified the Republican Party. What happened?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nGroundwork for the shift was laid in the run-up to the 1964 election by rightwing elements in the Republican Party, which gained momentum from the loss of the then-moderate Nixon to John F. Kennedy in 1960. This faction of the party had never stopped warring against the New Deal. Its standard bearer was Barry Goldwater, a senator from Arizona and heir to a department store fortune. His pampered upbringing and wealth notwithstanding, Goldwater affected a cowboy\u2019s rough-and-tumble persona in his dress and speech, casting himself as a walking embodiment of the Marlboro Man\u2019s disdain for the nanny state. Goldwater and the reactionary stalwarts who rallied to him saw the Democratic Party as a mortal threat to the nation: domestically, because of the corrupting influence of a powerful central government deeply involved in regulating the marketplace and using taxes to reallocate wealth downward, and abroad in its willingness to compromise with communist countries instead of going to war against them. Goldwater himself, though, was no racial throwback. For instance, in 1957 and again in 1960 he voted in favor of federal civil rights legislation. By 1961, however, Goldwater and his partisans had become convinced that the key to electoral success lay in gaining ground in the South, and that in turn required appealing to racist sentiments in white voters, even at the cost of black support. As Goldwater drawled, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 and 1968, so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.\u201d\n\nThis racial plan riled more moderate members of the Republican establishment, such as New York senator Jacob Javits, who in the fall of 1963 may have been the first to refer to a \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d in the context of repudiating it. By then, however, the right wing of the party had won out. As the conservative journalist Robert Novak reported after attending a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Denver during the summer of 1963: \u201cA good many, perhaps a majority of the party\u2019s leadership, envision substantial political gold to be mined in the racial crisis by becoming in fact, though not in name, the White Man\u2019s Party. \u2018Remember,\u2019 one astute party worker said quietly . . . \u2018this isn\u2019t South Africa. The white man outnumbers the Negro 9 to 1 in this country.\u2019 \u201d The rise of a racially-identified GOP is not a tale of latent bigotry in that party. It is instead a story centered on the strategic decision to use racism to become \u201cthe White Man\u2019s Party.\u201d\n\nThat same summer of 1963, as key Republican leaders strategized on how to shift their party to the far right racially, the Democrats began to lean in the other direction. Northern constituents were increasingly appalled by the violence, shown almost nightly on broadcast television, of Southern efforts to beat down civil rights protesters. Reacting to the growing clamor that something be done, President Kennedy introduced a sweeping civil rights bill that stirred the hopes of millions that segregation would soon be illegal in employment and at business places open to the public. Despite these hopes, however, prospects for the bill\u2019s passage seemed dim, as the Southern Democrats were loath to support civil rights and retained sufficient power to bottle up the bill. Then on November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated. His vice president, Lyndon Johnson, assumed the presidency vowing to make good on Kennedy\u2019s priorities, chief among them civil rights. Only five days after Kennedy\u2019s death, Johnson in his first address to Congress implored the assembly that \u201cno memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy\u2019s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\u201d Even under these conditions, it took Johnson\u2019s determined stewardship to overcome three months of dogged legislative stalling before Kennedy\u2019s civil rights bill finally passed the next summer. Known popularly as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it still stands as the greatest civil rights achievement of the era.\n\nIndicating the persistence of the old, internally divided racial politics of both parties, the act passed with broad bipartisan support and against broad bipartisan opposition\u2014the cleavage was regional, rather than in terms of party affiliation. Roughly 90 percent of non-Southern senators supported the bill, while 95 percent of Southern senators opposed it. Yet, heralding the incipient emergence of the new politics of party alignment along racial lines, Barry Goldwater also voted against the civil rights bill. He was one of only five senators from outside the South to do so. Goldwater claimed he saw a looming Orwellian state moving to coerce private citizens to spy on each other for telltale signs of racism. \u201cTo give genuine effect to the prohibitions of this bill,\u201d Goldwater contended from the Senate floor, \u201cbids fair to result in the development of an \u2018informer\u2019 psychology in great areas of our national life\u2014neighbor spying on neighbor, workers spying on workers, businessmen spying on businessmen.\u201d This all seemed a little hysterical. More calculatingly, it could not have escaped Goldwater\u2019s attention that voting against a civil rights law associated with blacks, Kennedy, and Johnson would help him \u201cgo hunting where the ducks are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRunning for president in 1964, the Arizonan strode across the South, hawking small-government bromides and racially coded appeals. In terms of the latter, he sold his vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bold stand in favor of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d and \u201cfreedom of association.\u201d States\u2019 rights, Goldwater insisted, preserved state autonomy against intrusive meddling from a distant power\u2014though obviously the burning issue of the day was the federal government\u2019s efforts to limit state involvement in racial degradation and group oppression. Freedom of association, Goldwater explained, meant the right of individuals to be free from government coercion in choosing whom to let onto their property\u2014but in the South this meant first and foremost the right of business owners to exclude blacks from hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and retail establishments. Like Wallace, Goldwater had learned how to talk about blacks without ever mentioning race.\n\nNo less than Wallace, Goldwater also demonstrated a flair for political stagecraft. A reporter following Goldwater\u2019s campaign through the South captured some of the spectacle: \u201cto show the country the \u2018lily-white\u2019 character of Republicanism in Dixie,\u201d party flaks filled the floor of the football stadium in Montgomery, Alabama, with \u201ca great field of white lilies\u2014living lilies, in perfect bloom, gorgeously arrayed.\u201d To this tableau, the campaign added \u201cseven hundred Alabama girls in long white gowns, all of a whiteness as impossible as the greenness of the field.\u201d Onto this scene emerged Goldwater, first moving this way and then that way through \u201cfifty or so yards of choice Southern womanhood,\u201d before taking the stand to give his speech defending states\u2019 rights and freedom of association. If these coded terms were too subtle for some, no one could fail to grasp the symbolism of the white lilies and the white-gowned women. Much of the emotional resistance to racial equality centered around the fear that black men would become intimate with white women. This scene represented \u201cwhat the rest of his Southern troops\u2014the thousands in the packed stands, the tens of thousands in Memphis and New Orleans and Atlanta and Shreveport and Greenville\u2014passionately believed they were defending.\u201d Goldwater made sure white Southerners understood he was fighting to protect them and their women against blacks.\n\nHow would Goldwater fare in the South? Beyond his racial pandering, that depended on how his anti-New Deal message was received. The Great Depression had devastated the region, which lagged behind the North in industry. Federal assistance to the poor as well as major infrastructure projects, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that brought electricity for the first time to millions, made Southerners among the New Deal\u2019s staunchest supporters. Yet despite the New Deal\u2019s popularity in the South, Goldwater campaigned against it. While he was willing to pander racially, Goldwater also prided himself on telling audiences what he thought they needed to hear, at least as far as the bracing virtues of rugged individualism were concerned. Thus he made clear, for instance, that he favored selling off the TVA, and also attacked other popular programs. As recounted by Rick Perlstein, a Goldwater political biographer, at one rally in West Virginia, Goldwater \u201ccalled the War on Poverty \u2018plainly and simply a war on your pocketbooks,\u2019 a fraud because only \u2018the vast resources of private business\u2019 could produce the wealth to truly slay penury.\u201d Perlstein singled out the tin-eared cruelty of this message: \u201cIn the land of the tar-paper shack, the gap-toothed smile, and the open sewer\u2014where the \u2018vast resources of private business\u2019 were represented in the person of the coal barons who gave men black lung, then sent them off to die without pensions\u2014the message just sounded perverse. As he left, lines of workmen jeered him.\u201d\n\nAnother factor also worked against Goldwater: he was a Republican, and the South reviled the Party of Lincoln. If across the nation neither party was seen as more or less friendly toward civil rights, the South had its own views on the question. There, it was the local Democratic machine that represented white interests, while the GOP was seen as the proximate cause of the Civil War and as the party of the carpetbaggers who had peremptorily ruled the South during Reconstruction. The hostility of generations of white Southerners toward Republicans only intensified with the Republican Eisenhower\u2019s decision to send in federal troops to enforce the Republican Warren\u2019s ruling forbidding school segregation in Brown. Most white Southerners had never voted Republican in their lives, and had vowed\u2014like their parents and grandparents before them\u2014 that they never would.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUltimately, however, these handicaps barely impeded Goldwater\u2019s performance in the South. He convinced many Southern voters to vote Republican for the first time ever, and in the Deep South, comprised of those five states with the highest black populations, Goldwater won outright. The anti-New Deal Republican carried Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina, states in which whites had never voted for a Republican president in more than miniscule numbers. This was a shocking transformation, one that can only be explained by Goldwater\u2019s ability to transmit a set of codes that white voters readily understood as a promise to protect racial segregation. It seemed that voters simply ignored Goldwater\u2019s philosophy of governance as well as his party affiliation and instead rewarded his hostility toward civil rights. In this sense, Goldwater\u2019s conservatism operated in the South less like a genuine political ideology and more like Wallace\u2019s soft porn racism: as a set of codes that voters readily understood as defending white supremacy. Goldwater didn\u2019t win the South as a small-government libertarian, but rather as a racist.\n\nIf in the South race trumped anti-government politics, in the North Goldwater\u2019s anti-civil rights attacks found much less traction. Opposing civil rights smacked too much of Southern intransigence, and while there was resistance to racial reform in the North, it had not yet become an overriding issue for many whites. That left Goldwater running on promises to end the New Deal, and this proved wildly unpopular. To campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to campaign against an activist government that had lifted the country out of the throes of a horrendous depression still squarely in the rear view mirror, and that had then launched millions into the middle class. More than that, though, to campaign against liberalism in 1964 was to attack government programs still largely aimed at whites\u2014and that sort of welfare was broadly understood as legitimate and warranted\n\nGoldwater\u2019s anti-welfare tirades produced a landslide victory, but for Lyndon Johnson. Voters crushed Goldwater\u2019s last-gasp attack on the New Deal state. Outside of the South, he lost by overwhelming numbers in every state except his Arizona home. Voters were offended by his over-the-top attacks on popular New Deal programs as well as by his penchant for saber rattling when it came to foreign policy. Goldwater especially suffered after the release of \u201cDaisy,\u201d a Johnson campaign ad that juxtaposed a little girl picking the petals off a flower with footage of a spiraling mushroom cloud, sending the message that Goldwater\u2019s militarism threatened nuclear Armageddon. In the end, the Democrats succeeded in making Goldwater look like a loon. \u201cTo the Goldwater slogan \u2018In Your Heart, You Know He\u2019s Right,\u2019 the Democrats shot back, \u2018In Your Guts, You Know He\u2019s Nuts.\u2019 \u201d The country as a whole, it seemed, had solidly allied itself with progressive governance, and big-money/small-government conservatism was finally, utterly dead.\n\nOr at least, this was the lesson most people took from the 1964 election. But like the clang of a distant alarm barely perceptible against the buzzing din of consensus, a warning was rising from the South: racial entreaties had convinced even the staunchest Democrats to abandon New Deal liberalism. If race-baiting had won over Southern whites to anti-government politics, could the same work across the country?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nNotwithstanding the emerging racial strategy initiated by Goldwater, when Richard Nixon secured the Republican nomination in 1968, the new racial politics of his party had not yet gelled, either within the party generally, or in Nixon himself. Indeed, the moderate Nixon\u2019s emergence as the party\u2019s presidential candidate reflected the extent to which the Goldwater faction had lost credibility in the wake of their champion\u2019s disastrous drubbing. Nevertheless, the dynamics of the presidential race would quickly push Nixon toward race-baiting. Nixon\u2019s principal opponent in 1968 was Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey. But running as an independent candidate, George Wallace was flanking Nixon on the right. By October 1, just a month before the election, Wallace was polling more support in the South than either Humphrey or Nixon. Nor was his support limited to that region. Wallace was siphoning crucial votes across the country, and staging massive rallies in ostensibly liberal strongholds, for instance drawing 20,000 partisans to Madison Square Garden in New York, and 70,000 faithful to the Boston Common\u2014more than any rally ever held by the Kennedys, Wallace liked to crow. Republican operatives guessed that perhaps 80 percent of the Wallace voters in the South would otherwise support Nixon, and a near-majority in the North as well.\n\nLate in the campaign, Nixon opted to publicly tack right on race. He had already reached a backroom deal with South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond\u2014 an arch-segregationist who had led the revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948 when it endorsed a modest civil rights plank, and who switched to become a Republican in 1964 to throw his weight behind Goldwater. Nixon bought Thurmond\u2019s support during the primary season by secretly promising that he would restrict federal enforcement of school desegregation in the South. Now he would make this same promise to the nation. On October 7, Nixon came out against \u201cforced busing,\u201d an increasingly potent euphemism for the system of transporting students across the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods in order to integrate schools. Mary Frances Berry pierces the pretense that the issue was putting one\u2019s child on a bus: \u201cAfrican-American attempts to desegregate schools were confronted by white flight and complaints that the problem was not desegregation, but busing, oftentimes by people who sent their children to school every day on buses, including mediocre white private academies established to avoid integration.\u201d \u201cBusing\u201d offered a Northern analog to states\u2019 rights. The language may have referred to transportation, but the emotional wallop came from defiance toward integration.\n\nNixon also began to hammer away at the issue of law and order. In doing so, he drew upon a rhetorical frame rooted in Southern resistance to civil rights. From the inception of the civil rights movement in the 1950s, Southern politicians had disparaged racial activists as \u201clawbreakers,\u201d as indeed technically they were. In the Jim Crow regions, African Americans had long pressed basic equality demands precisely by breaking laws mandating segregation: sit-ins and freedom rides purposefully violated Jim Crow statutes in order to challenge white supremacist social norms. Dismissing these protesters as criminals shifted the issue from a defense of white supremacy to a more neutral-seeming concern with \u201corder,\u201d while simultaneously stripping the activists of moral stature. Demonstrators were no longer Americans willing to risk beatings and even death for a grand ideal, but rather criminal lowlifes disposed toward antisocial behavior. Ultimately, the language of law and order justified a more \u201cquiet\u201d form of violence in defense of the racial status quo, replacing lynchings with mass arrests for trespassing and delinquency.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, \u201claw and order\u201d had become a surrogate expression for concern about the civil rights movement. Illustrating this rhetoric\u2019s increasingly national reach, in 1965 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover denounced the advocacy of nonviolent civil disobedience by civil rights leaders as a catalyst for lawbreaking and even violent rioting: \u201c\u2018Civil disobedience,\u2019 a seditious slogan of gross irresponsibility, has captured the imagination of citizens. ... I am greatly concerned that certain racial leaders are doing the civil rights movement a great disservice by suggesting that citizens need only obey the laws with which they agree. Such an attitude breeds disrespect for the law and even civil disorder and rioting.\u201d This sense of growing disorder was accentuated by urban riots often involving protracted battles between the police and minority communities. In addition, large and increasingly angry protests against the Vietnam War also added to the fear of metastasizing social strife. Exploiting the growing panic that equated social protest with social chaos, one of Nixon\u2019s campaign commercials showed flashing images of demonstrations, riots, police, and violence, over which a deep voice intoned: \u201cLet us recognize that the first right of every American is to be free from domestic violence. So I pledge to you, we shall have order in the United States.\u201d A caption stated boldly: \u201cThis time. . . . vote like your whole world depended on it ... NIXON.\u201d\n\nNixon had mastered Wallace\u2019s dark art. Forced bussing, law and order, and security from unrest as the essential civil right of the majority\u2014all of these were coded phrases that allowed Nixon to appeal to racial fears without overtly mentioning race at all. Yet race remained the indisputable, intentional subtext of the appeal. As Nixon exulted after watching one of his own commercials: \u201cYep, this hits it right on the nose . . . it\u2019s all about law and order and the damn Negro-Puerto Rican groups out there.\u201d\n\nNixon didn\u2019t campaign exclusively on racial themes; notably, he also stressed his opposition to anti-war protesters, while simultaneously portraying himself as the candidate most likely to bring the war to an end. Nevertheless, racial appeals formed an essential element of Nixon\u2019s \u201968 campaign. Nixon\u2019s special counsel, John Ehrlichman, bluntly summarized that year\u2019s campaign strategy: \u201cWe\u2019ll go after the racists.\u201d According to Ehrlichman, the \u201csubliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon\u2019s statements and speeches.\u201d\n\nNixon\u2019s Southern Strategy\n\nNixon barely won in 1968, edging Humphrey by less than one percent of the national vote. Wallace, meanwhile, had captured nearly 14 percent of the vote. Had Nixon\u2019s coded race-baiting helped? Initially there was uncertainty, and in his first two years in office Nixon governed as if he still believed the federal government had some role to play in helping out nonwhites. For instance, Nixon came into office proposing the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor, which would have gone a long way toward breaking down racial inequalities. But over the course of those two years, a new understanding consolidated regarding the tidal shift that had occurred.\n\nOn the Democratic side, in 1970 two pollsters, Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg, published The Real Majority, cautioning their party that \u201cSocial Issues\u201d now divided the base. \u201cThe machinist\u2019s wife in Dayton may decide to leave the Democratic reservation in 1972 and vote for Nixon or Wallace or their ideological descendants,\u201d Scammon and Wattenberg warned. \u201cIf she thinks the Democrats feel that she isn\u2019t scared of crime but that she\u2019s really a bigot, if she thinks that Democrats feel the police are Fascist pigs and the Black Panthers and the Weathermen are just poor, misunderstood, picked-upon kids, if she thinks that Democrats are for the hip drug culture and that she, the machinist\u2019s wife, is not only a bigot, but a square, then good-bye lady\u2014and good-bye Democrats.\u201d How, then, could the party get ahead of these issues? Scammon and Wattenberg were frank: \u201cThe Democrats in the South were hurt by being perceived (correctly) as a pro-black national party.\u201d The solution was clear: the Democratic Party had to temper its \u201cpro-black stance.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, a leading Nixon strategist had come to the same conclusion about race as a potential wedge issue\u2014though, predictably, with a different prescription. In 1969, Kevin Phillips published The Emerging Republican Majority, arguing that because of racial resentments a historical realignment was underway that would cement a new Republican majority that would endure for decades. A young prodigy obsessed with politics, Phillips had worked out the details of his argument in the mid-1960s, and then had gone to work helping to elect Nixon. When the 1968 returns seemed to confirm his thesis, he published his research\u2014nearly 500 pages, with 47 maps and 143 charts. Beneath the details, Phillips had a simple, even deterministic thesis: \u201cHistorically, our party system has reflected layer upon layer of group oppositions.\u201d Politics, according to Phillips, turned principally on group animosity\u2014\u201cthe prevailing cleavages in American voting behavior have been ethnic and cultural. Politically, at least, the United States has not been a very effective melting pot.\u201d\n\nAs to what was driving the latest realignment, Phillips was blunt: \u201cThe Negro problem, having become a national rather than a local one, is the principal cause of the breakup of the New Deal coalition.\u201d For Phillips, it was almost inevitable that most whites would abandon the Democratic Party once it became identified with blacks. \u201cEthnic and cultural division has so often shaped American politics that, given the immense midcentury impact of Negro enfranchisement and integration, reaction to this change almost inevitably had to result in political realignment.\u201d Phillips saw his emerging Republican majority this way: \u201cthe nature of the majority\u2014or potential majority\u2014seems clear. It is largely white and middle class. It is concentrated in the South, the West, and suburbia.\u201d\n\nThe number crunchers had spoken. The Southern strategy, incipient for a decade, had matured into a clear route to electoral dominance. The old Democratic alliance of Northeastern liberals, the white working class, Northern blacks, and Southern Democrats, could be riven by racial appeals. Beginning in 1970, Richard Nixon embraced the politics of racial division wholeheartedly. He abandoned the idea of a flat wealth transfer to the poor. Now, Nixon repeatedly emphasized law and order issues. He railed against forced busing in the North. He reversed the federal government\u2019s position on Southern school integration, slowing the process down and making clear that the courts would have no help from his administration. But perhaps nothing symbolized the new Nixon more than his comments in December 1970. Reflecting his initially moderate position on domestic issues, early in his administration Nixon had appointed George Romney\u2014a liberal Republican and, incidentally, Mitt Romney\u2019s father\u2014as his secretary of housing and urban development. In turn, Romney had made integration of the suburbs his special mission, even coming up with a plan to cut off federal funds to communities that refused to allow integrated housing. By late 1970, however, when these jurisdictions howled at the temerity, Nixon took their side, throwing his cabinet officer under the bus. In a public address, Nixon baldly stated: \u201cI can assure you that it is not the policy of this government to use the power of the federal government . . . for forced integration of the suburbs. I believe that forced integration of the suburbs is not in the national interest.\u201d41 That dog whistle blasted like the shriek of an onrushing train.\n\nIn 1963, Robert Novak had written that many Republican leaders were intent on converting the Party of Lincoln into the White Man\u2019s Party. The following year, Goldwater went down in crushing defeat, winning only 36 percent of the white vote. Even so, less than a decade later, the racial transmogrification of the Republicans was well underway. In 1972, Nixon\u2019s first full dog whistle campaign netted him 67 percent of the white vote, leaving his opponent, George McGovern, with support from less than one in three whites. Defeated by the Southern strategy, McGovern neatly summed it up: \u201cWhat is the Southern Strategy? It is this. It says to the South: Let the poor stay poor, let your economy trail the nation, forget about decent homes and medical care for all your people, choose officials who will oppose every effort to benefit the many at the expense of the few\u2014and in return, we will try to overlook the rights of the black man, appoint a few southerners to high office, and lift your spirits by attacking the \u2018eastern establishment\u2019 whose bank accounts we are filling with your labor and your industry.\u201d42 McGovern erred in supposing that the Southern strategy pertained only to the South. Nixon had already learned from Wallace, and then later from the number crunchers, that coded racial appeals would work nationwide. Other than that, especially in its class and race dimensions, McGovern had dog whistle politics dead to rights.\n\nExcerpted from \"Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class\" by Ian Haney L\u00f3pez.
