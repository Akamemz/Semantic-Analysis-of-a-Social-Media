    "content": "With cities facing both rapid growth and radical , permanent climate change , urban authorities are faced with an increasingly vulnerable population\nOn a sweltering summer day in Washington , DC , Judy Williams pulls up to a homeless day center to fill her van with bottled water .\nThe homeless outreach coordinatoris headed to the spots where she knows she \u2019 ll find people who are living outside .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll make sure they \u2019 re not lying down on the ground , and tap their feet for a response , \u201d Williams said .\nInside the center , a few dozen people hide from the heat in a windowless room with cafeteria-style tables and loud televisions . Two nearby men \u2019 s shelters are also open around-the-clock instead of just at night because of a city-wide heat alert .\nThere \u2019 s free lunch , as well as computers for job searching , laundry machines and showers \u2013 but managers say people also visit just to get out of the sun .\nThe center is in the middle of warehouses and near a highway , and all the concrete radiates heat . Matthew King , a 44-year-old who works in a tire shop but is between homes , said he visits regularly , \u201c especially when it \u2019 s hot . \u201d\nQ & A Why is heat an issue in US cities ? Show Hide Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis . It \u2019 s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those as far north as Alaska , where thermometers hit 90F ( 32C ) for the first time . This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities . Mark Oliver , special projects editor , Guardian US\n\u201c This is the hottest I \u2019 ve ever seen in July , \u201d said King at the center , which is just a few miles from the White House rose garden where President Trump said in 2017 that the US will leave the Paris climate change accord .\nResidents of the US capital are regularly baked in heatwaves and endure stiflingly thick humidit .\nBut much like many cities around the world , Washington DC is being slowly cooked by the human-driven climate crisis to the extent its entire character will be transformed .\nBy 2080 , researchers recently found , Washington DC \u2019 s climate will resemble what northern Mississippi or Dallas is like currently .\nUnless drastic action is taken to slash greenhouse gases , global heating will transform the climates of almost every community in the US by the time today \u2019 s children are entering retirement . Outdoors in Philadelphia will feel more like Memphis ; New York City is set to morph into northeastern Arkansas ; Houston and Miami have no US comparison , leaping instead deep into climates currently found in Mexico .\n\u201c Every city gets warmer , none get cooler , \u201d said Matt Fitzpatrick , a University of Maryland academic who formulated the climate projections for US cities , based on a range of heat and rainfall scenarios .\nIn the lifetime of children today , a lot of these cities are going to be dramatically transformed Matt Fitzpatrick , University of Maryland\nIts research shows how 540 North American urban areas will by 2080 become , on average , \u201c most like the contemporary climate of locations about 500 miles ( 805kms ) away and mainly to the south . \u201d\nThe average temperature in US cities will rise by a blistering 9F ( 5C ) by the end of the century , compared to the period of 1960-1990 , if greenhouse gas emissions aren \u2019 t curbed . Some cities will be outliers \u2013 Fairbanks , Alaska , for example , is in danger of heating up by a sweltering 11.8F ( 6.6C ) .\n\u201c Cities have built infrastructure for a climate that will no longer be there , \u201d Fitzpatrick said . \u201c They will have to live with more heat and , if they are on the coast , flooding too . In the lifetime of children today , a lot of these places are going to be dramatically transformed . \u201d\nThis new reality of searing heat is an existential one for those most vulnerable \u2013 the sick , the elderly and , in particular , the homeless . Washington officials estimate 6,521 people were experiencing homelessness this year , down 6 % from 2018 . In the broader metropolitan area , about 9,794 people are without homes .\nLaura Zeilinger , director of the Department of Human Services , said as the city heats up , her goal stays the same \u2013 to get people into homes . Zeilinger said she isn \u2019 t aware of any heat-related deaths in the city , although she does review any hypothermia-related deaths at the end of each winter .\n\u201c It \u2019 s when people don \u2019 t have housing that the elements become life threatening , \u201d Zeilinger said .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take much of a temperature increase to permanently shift the expected climate of a city . Fitzpatrick found that a 9.8F ( 5.5C ) average temperature increase during Washington DC \u2019 s winter would plunge it into what the deep south is like today . This scenario , possible if emissions aren \u2019 t curbed , would also make DC around 70 % wetter .\n\u201c When people hear about a few degrees in temperature rise they can think \u2018 that doesn \u2019 t sound too bad. \u2019 This shows it can really have a big impact , \u201d said Fitzpatrick , who has started to ponder the altered state of Cumberland , Maryland \u2013 the town he lives in . \u201c It \u2019 s going to look more like southern Kentucky , more of a subtropical climate , \u201d he said . \u201c We get a fair amount of snow now but that \u2019 s all going to change . It \u2019 s going to be very different . \u201d\nWashington DC has been given a recent glimpse into its future \u2013 a 92F ( 33C ) burst of heat last May saw the city break a 105-year-old record for high temperatures . Sitting on the banks of two tidal rivers \u2013 the Potomac and the Anacostia \u2013 Washington DC is also essentially a delta city at growing risk of flooding as bursts of rainfall become more intense .\nIt won \u2019 t just be uncomfortable , it will be a life or death challenge for many people Jessica Grannis , Georgetown Climate Center\nCity leaders have attempted to identify the threat and counter it . A climate resilience plan , released in April , states that DC \u2019 s temperature has already risen by 2F ( 1.1C ) over the past 50 years , with a further 4.5F ( 2.5C ) increase to come within 30 years .\nThe number of \u201c heat emergency days \u201d in DC , where the heat index tops 95F ( 35C ) , is expected to occur on more than 50 days a year as the century draws to a close . \u201c That means that , in 2080 , our summer will be one long heat emergency , \u201d the DC resilience document warns .\nThis scorching new climate is set to heavily burden DC \u2019 s growing population , many of them low-income and struggling with housing affordability . Vulnerable people will likely suffer dehydration or heatstroke , with increasing use of air conditioning placing a strain on the electrical grid .\n\u201c It will affect how people live , work and get around in the city , \u201d said Jessica Grannis , adaptation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center . \u201c It won \u2019 t just be uncomfortable , it will be a life or death challenge for many people . Once it starts getting very hot at night , people without air conditioning are going to be at serious risk if they can \u2019 t cool down properly . \u201d\nKevin Bush , DC \u2019 s chief resilience officer , has pledged to \u201c make the city \u2019 s immune system stronger \u201d to cope with this threat , comparing it to how cities in California prepare for the ructions of an earthquake .\nUnder the resilience plan , all DC buildings must be retrofitted to cope with rising heat and flooding threats by 2050 , with all new buildings adhering to stricter codes within 13 years . The most at-risk buildings may even be removed .\nThere \u2019 s a plan to add more greenery to DC by planting more trees , which will provide shade , and other vegetation that will help soak up stormwater from heavy downpours . The curbsides of several major streets are already getting a makeover , with new plants being bedded in to help cool down the city .\n\u201c If walk along the streets in DC at the moment you \u2019 ll see a lot of pavements being taken out in favour of plantings , \u201d Grannis said . DC is , she added , \u201c one of the most climate prepared cities in the US . Unfortunately it \u2019 s not quite the same everywhere . \u201d\nDallas , which has a climate that Washington DC is moving towards , is currently trying to muster its own response to the rising heat . By 2080 , according to the University of Maryland research , Dallas is set to become more like New Orleans \u2013 nearly 9F ( 5C ) hotter and nearly three times as wet .\n\u201c We had a storm event a few weeks ago where 350,000 people lost power , trees were knocked over . People started to think we maybe aren \u2019 t as resilient as we thought , even when it \u2019 s not a Hurricane Harvey sort of event , \u201d said James McGuire , director of environmental quality at the City of Dallas .\nDallas \u2019 situation is exacerbated by the vast sprawl of concrete at its heart . A third of its surface is made up of rooftops , parking lots , highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat . This gives Dallas one of the highest \u201c urban heat island \u201d effects in the US , with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas . Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year .\nOf all US cities , only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas , found a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation , which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions .\nWe are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before James McGuire , City of Dallas\nMcGuire said the city hasn \u2019 t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs \u201c a lot more trees. \u201d A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support . McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when \u201c impacts are so severe everyone will have to do something . \u201d\nDallas \u2019 s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn \u2019 t taken , according to a major US government assessment released last year . The city will also be prone to the whiplash of prolonged droughts interspersed by the drumbeat of heavier rainfall .\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest More greenery could transform areas of Dallas such as the Southwestern Medical District , one of the hottest areas of the city thanks to its high concentration of roads , concrete and buildings .
