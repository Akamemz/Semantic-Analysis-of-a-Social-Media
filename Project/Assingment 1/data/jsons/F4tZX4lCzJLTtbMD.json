    "content": "California plays an outsized role in American agriculture . The state grows one-third of the country 's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts . That includes 99 percent of almonds , 95 percent of broccoli , 90 percent of tomatoes , and 74 percent of lettuce .\nSo you 'd think that the California 's four-year drought and severe water crisis would have a devastating impact on our produce .\nBut that has n't really happened \u2014 certainly not yet . Recently , the US Department of Agriculture reported that US supermarket prices rose just 2.9 percent in 2014 , and were only expected to increase 2 to 3 percent in 2015 . Those numbers are basically in line with average annual increases over the past 20 years .\nWhat 's more , the USDA currently projects that overall fruit and vegetable prices will barely budge in 2015 \u2014 despite the severe and ongoing drought in California . So what 's going on ?\nFood prices are affected by a lot more than just farming\nOver at the Los Angeles Times , Russ Parsons lists several factors at play here . A key one is that the cost of growing produce only makes up around 10 percent of the retail price you actually see at the supermarket . There 's also transportation , packaging , and distribution , plus various mark-ups .\nThe prices of many foods `` are driven more by market demand than drought ''\nThat means that difficult conditions for farmers wo n't necessarily send food prices at the grocery store skyrocketing . There could also be countervailing factors at play . For example , oil prices have been falling around the world since last June , which , as the USDA notes , can help cut down on food transportation costs .\nIn a similar vein , a 2014 study from the University of California , Davis on California 's drought pointed out that grocery store prices for nuts , wine grapes , and dairy food `` are driven more by market demand than by the drought . '' As such , that study concluded that California 's water crisis would n't greatly affect consumer prices across the nation .\nParsons also points out that California 's farmers are n't all being equally devastated by the drought . Some agricultural regions of the state , particularly on the coast , have been less affected than areas like the Central Valley . What 's more , some farmers facing water shortages have also experienced favorable temperatures and growing conditions \u2014 strawberry farmers are one example \u2014 which has blunted the impact .\nAdd it all up , and you get a mixed picture . Carrot prices have risen 48 percent in the last year \u2014 but strawberry prices have fallen 8 percent . Asparagus has fallen 7 percent .

The UC Davis study found that , in the Central Valley , groundwater pumping has helped farmers replace about 75 percent of the water they 've lost due to cutbacks from reservoirs .\nThe problem is that those underground aquifers are getting depleted rapidly \u2014 and , since they built up over a long period of time , they do n't recharge easily . A 2012 study in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences found that the Central Valley 's aquifers do n't refill completely even during California 's `` wet '' periods ( because pumping does n't totally stop ) .
