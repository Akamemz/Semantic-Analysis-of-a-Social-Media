Christopher Stevens , the ambassador , and three other Americans \u201c outrageous. \u201d The attack apparently began as a reaction by an angry mob to a YouTube video denouncing Islam \u2019 s founding prophet .\n\u201c While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others , we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement released by the White House .\nThe news of the ambassador \u2019 s death emerged on Wednesday after violence spilled over the American Consulate in Benghazi and demonstrators stormed the American Embassy in Cairo . The responses issued by the rival presidential campaigns demonstrate the difficulty candidates face while dealing with the continued volatility of the Middle East , especially after Arab Spring toppled governments across the region .\nMr. Obama said that he has \u201c directed my administration to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in Libya , and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe . \u201d\nIn his statement , Mr. Obama added a personal testimonial to Mr. Stevens .\n\u201c Chris was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States , \u201d he said . \u201c Throughout the Libyan revolution , he selflessly served our country and the Libyan people at our mission in Benghazi . As ambassador in Tripoli , he has supported Libya \u2019 s transition to democracy . His legacy will endure wherever human beings reach for liberty and justice . \u201d\nOn Tuesday night , as more information about protests in Cairo and the deaths in Libya was released , Mr. Romney \u2019 s campaign called the Obama administration \u2019 s response to them \u201c disgraceful . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American Consulate worker in Benghazi , \u201d Mr. Romney said in a statement . \u201c It \u2019 s disgraceful that the Obama administration \u2019 s first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks . \u201d\nMr. Romney was making an apparent reference to a statement released by the American Embassy in Cairo condemning the trailer for the video , made by an Israeli-American .
