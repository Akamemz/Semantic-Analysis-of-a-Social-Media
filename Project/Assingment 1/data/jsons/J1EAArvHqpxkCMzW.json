If he tries to ignore it , he 's going to run into a brick wall . ''\nThe House speaker was addressing concerns that Obama is preparing to bypass Congress this year with more executive actions . Advisers for days have signaled that Obama will promote that approach in his State of the Union address -- and will use his `` pen '' and his `` phone '' in 2014 to achieve the results he wants .\nThe president took a first step in that direction on Tuesday , announcing an executive order raising the minimum wage for new federal contract workers to $ 10.10 an hour , from $ 7.25 . Obama will use the move to apply additional pressure on Congress to approve a similar increase for all workers .\nBoehner , speaking later to reporters , said Obama likely has the authority to raise the wage for federal contractors . He downplayed the impact the move would have . `` Let 's understand something : this affects not one current contract , it only affects future contracts with the federal government . And so I think the question is , how many people , Mr. President will this executive action actually help ? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero , '' he said .\nBut Boehner reminded the president not to overstep his bounds as he weighs other executive actions .\n`` House Republicans will continue to look closely at whether the president is faithfully executing the laws -- as he took an oath to do , '' Boehner said . `` Now I think dealing with federal contracts and the minimum wage , he probably has the authority to do that but we 're going to watch very closely because there 's a Constitution that we all take an oath to , including him . ''\nThe minimum wage push is expected to be a centerpiece of Obama 's State of the Union address , along with other measures his team says are meant to address `` income inequality . ''\nObama will also take credit for an economy that by many indicators is gaining some strength on his watch . As a result , he will talk positively about a recovery that remains elusive to many Americans .\n`` We hope that he does not dwell on the successes of the economy , which may be apparent in employment statistics , the GDP and stock market gains , but which are not felt by folks at the grocery store , '' Democratic political analysts James Carville and Stan Greenberg wrote in a recent strategy memo .\nThe president will present Congress with an agenda largely unchanged from what he called for a year ago , but one that nevertheless fits into this year 's economic opportunity theme . He will continue to seek an overhaul of immigration laws and expanded pre-school education as well as an increase in the minimum wage .\nBut after a year in which those proposals languished and gun control failed , Obama will stress success through his executive actions -- though their reach would be far more modest than what he could achieve through legislation .\n`` Congress is slow to action and we 're not going to wait for that , '' White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said in an interview on `` CBS This Morning .
