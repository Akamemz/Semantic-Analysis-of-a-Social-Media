    "content": "President Donald Trump is very mad about AT & T over CNN . The thousands of jobs it \u2019 s cutting , not so much .\nThe telecommunications giant , which acquired CNN through its $ 85 billion merger with Time Warner in 2018 , has generated scrutiny among the press , organizers , and activists over job cuts it has made over the past several months . Most recently , Axios reported that thousands of AT & T workers were about to lose their posts after training foreigners in line to replace them this year . Trump has positioned himself as a job creator and a crusader against outsourcing , but when it comes to AT & T , he \u2019 s not saying anything \u2014 well , at least not about jobs . His focus is on his ongoing annoyance with CNN .\nOn Wednesday , three days after the Axios report , Trump took to Twitter to take a swipe at CNN after a supposed \u201c ratings dive \u201d and suggested parent-company AT & T \u201c should make changes. \u201d It \u2019 s not clear what specific changes he would want .\nCan \u2019 t believe @ ATT keeps the management after yet another @ CNN ratings dive . Nobody watching , NO CREDIBILITY ! Maybe they should make changes at AT & T ? https : //t.co/jdCLuNWEEQ \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 2 , 2020\nThis is hardly the first time Trump has called for AT & T to do something about CNN \u2014 which presumably translates to shifting to coverage that \u2019 s more favorable to him . He spoke out against the AT & T-Time Warner merger from the get-go , and while there were plenty of legitimate reasons to oppose the deal \u2014 it marked a significant amount of consolidation in the media industry , and multiple lawmakers raised red flags about it \u2014 Trump \u2019 s animus toward CNN was evidently in play . He has called on AT & T to fire CNN chief Jeff Zucker , and over the summer , the president pushed for people to stop \u201c using or subscribing \u201d to AT & T in order to force changes at the network .\nI believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ ATT , they would be forced to make big changes at @ CNN , which is dying in the ratings anyway . It is so unfair with such bad , Fake News ! Why wouldn \u2019 t they act . When the World watches @ CNN , it gets a false picture of USA . Sad ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 3 , 2019\nJust arrived in the United Kingdom . The only problem is that @ CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while , I turned it off . All negative & so much Fake News , very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop . Why doesn \u2019 t owner @ ATT do something ? \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 3 , 2019\nWorkers and organizers say thousands of jobs have been lost at the company , and more are about to go out the door . But it appears the main job Trump is worried about at AT & T is Zucker \u2019 s .\nAT & T seems as though it could be a prime target for Trump to make a jobs push\nAT & T was a major beneficiary of the tax cut bill President Trump signed into law in December 2017 . Before the legislation was even passed , the company said it would make investments that would translate to \u201c 7,000 good jobs for the middle class \u201d if it was enacted , and soon after , it made a splashy announcement about worker bonuses . But while the bonuses happened , not so much happened with the thousands of new jobs \u2014 at least not for Americans .\nAccording to the Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) , which represents about 100,000 AT & T workers , AT & T has eliminated more than 33,000 jobs since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which saved it billions of dollars , was passed . And as Axios reported , the company has \u201c expanded alliances \u201d with major outsourcing companies that have allowed it to shift jobs abroad , and it is on track to do more of it in 2020 .\n\u201c They seem to be recommitting and doubling down on the job cuts and the outsourcing , \u201d Beth Allen , communications director at CWA , said in a phone interview . Allen said that call center and field technicians have been most affected by job cuts , while those in the wireless division have seen a lesser impact . And while the bonuses were nice , they were also a one-time benefit , not a long-term improvement .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve only continued to cut jobs , and that money [ AT & T got from the tax cuts ] , they \u2019 ve been using it to buy back stock and do other things that benefit the shareholders and the executives in the company , \u201d Allen said .\nAccording to estimates from CBS MoneyWatch , thanks to the tax cuts AT & T could save $ 42 billion over the course of a decade .\nAT & T has also been under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to make changes at the company . In October , it reached an agreement with the firm to boost stock buybacks , add board members , and enhance \u201c operational efficiency , \u201d among other measures . ( Oftentimes , \u201c efficiency \u201d translates to job cuts in corporate speak . )\nWhen Elliott first announced its involvement with AT & T , Trump weighed in \u2014 but again , only on the CNN front . Months before , when 20,000 AT & T workers went on strike for four days over contract negotiations , Trump said nothing .\n... But most importantly , @ CNN is bad for the USA . Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe . This is why foreign leaders are always asking me , \u201c Why does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much ? \u201d It is a fraudulent shame , & all comes from the top ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 9 , 2019\nAnd now , with more AT & T jobs apparently about to disappear , the president is ignoring the matter and instead just paying attention to CNN . Sara Blackwell , a Florida lawyer who represents US workers displaced by foreign workers and spoke with Axios about AT & T , said in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she reached out to the White House about the matter but \u201c nothing was done . \u201d\nAT & T and the White House did not return requests for comment for this story . An AT & T spokesperson told Axios that the company is \u201c continuously working to be more efficient \u201d in its operations and was trying to help employees find other positions in the company when possible .\nTrump can \u2019 t look beyond himself and his grievances with CNN\nYou would think thousands of workers losing their jobs would be a decent reason for Trump to ask AT & T to \u201c do something , \u201d but instead , he \u2019 s focused on CNN .
