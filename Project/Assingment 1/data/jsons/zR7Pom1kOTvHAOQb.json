    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When President Trump talks about the hundreds of vacancies scattered across his administration he \u2019 s clear about where he places the blame : \u201c Obstructionist \u201d Democrats , he says at rallies and on Twitter , are slow walking his picks .\nBut a review by \u2588\u2588\u2588 of the president \u2019 s most-delayed appointments , including some who have been waiting for nearly a year , finds a more nuanced explanation that involves timing , concerns about an agency \u2019 s direction and , sometimes , opposition from Republicans .\nTrump \u2019 s appointment to head the Central Intelligence Agency \u2019 s office of inspector general has faced questions from Republicans . A proposed ambassador has languished over bipartisan inertia . A nominee to the Department of Health and Human Services was waylaid as lawmakers focused instead on the president \u2019 s tax overhaul .\nTrump has ratcheted up pressure on the Senate , and Republicans are considering a more aggressive schedule to get caught up on lingering nominations for hundreds of mid-level jobs that run the day-to-day operations at federal agencies .\n\u201c Waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations , worst in history , \u201d Trump tweeted recently . \u201c Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct , all they know how to do . \u201d\nTrump has a point : The Senate has taken more time to clear his nominees than those of his recent predecessors \u2014 85 days on average compared with 67 days for President Barack Obama , according to the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service .\nJust more than 420 Trump appointees are confirmed compared with 652 at this point in George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency .\nBut experts also note the White House got a slow start , and has yet to announce candidates for hundreds of other positions .\n\u201c Some of it is partisanship , some of it isn \u2019 t , \u201d said Max Stier , president of the Partnership for Public Service , who believes far too many political appointments require Senate approval .\n\u201c Some of it is Republicans who don \u2019 t like what they see , and want to negotiate something out of it , \u201d Stier said .\nWhile Trump \u2019 s pick to lead the CIA , Gina Haspel , won confirmation last week , another agency nominee has been stalled for months . Christopher Sharpley was named in September as the CIA \u2019 s inspector general but was ensnared in a controversy over whistle-blower protections .\nIn Sharpley \u2019 s case , it is opposition from Republicans \u2014 not Democrats \u2014 that is most notable . Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , co-signed a letter last year citing investigations into whether Sharpley punished whistle-blowers . During a hearing last fall , Sharpley said he wasn \u2019 t aware of the probes .\nGrassley questioned that testimony , writing that investigators had sought to speak with Sharpley for months , and that they at one point visited his office to review documents .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty clear he was misrepresenting his knowledge of the reprisal complaints against him , \u201d said John Tye of Whistleblower Aid , a Washington-based group that represents two former CIA employees who filed complaints against Sharpley .\nA CIA spokesman did not respond directly to questions about those concerns but said officials are working with the Senate Intelligence Committee \u201c toward a successful confirmation. \u201d Sharpley is serving in the job as the \u201c acting \u201d head of the office .\nStephen Vaden was among the first Trump allies to land at the Department of Agriculture last year , part of the \u201c beachhead \u201d team charged with helping the new administration get its hands around the 84,000-plus employee bureaucracy .\nBut his nomination to be the department \u2019 s top lawyer , which was sent to Capitol Hill in September , has stalled for nearly nine months . Almost a dozen others nominated for Agriculture posts have since breezed past Vaden on their way to unanimous confirmation .\nPublic opposition has come from Democrats and centers on two issues : The reassignment of senior career staff at USDA and Vaden \u2019 s prior legal work on a voter registration law in North Carolina that a federal court struck down for targeting African-American voters with \u201c almost surgical precision . \u201d\nVaden , a Tennessee native , has Democratic opposition but also Democratic support .
