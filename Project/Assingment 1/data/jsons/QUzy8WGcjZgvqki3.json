On ABC 's `` This Week , '' White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said he expected Republican opposition on Capitol Hill to eventually succumb to constituent pressure . `` My belief is that as this pain starts to gradually spread to communities affected by military spending , to children who need mental health services , to people who care about our border security , I believe that more Republican colleagues who are concerned about this harm to their constituents will choose bipartisan compromise on revenue raising tax reform with serious entitlement reform , '' he told anchor George Stephanopoulos . The White House says Obama spent Saturday on the phone with senators of both parties over a compromise . http : //abcn.ws/161jHKT\nCABINET NEWCOMERS : This morning President Obama will announce three new Cabinet appointments . He is nominating Gina McCarthy , who heads the EPA 's air and radiation office , as the agency 's next administrator , MIT physicist Ernest Moniz as Energy Secretary , and Walmart 's Sylvia Matthews Burwell as his next budget director , report ABC 's Jonathan Karl and Mary Bruce . Moniz is none too popular with environmentalists who say he is booster of fossil fuels . But Burwell and McCarthy would bring more diversity to Obama 's second-term Cabinet , following criticism that top positions have all been filled by men . The announcements take place at 10:15 a.m . ET and come ahead of today 's afternoon Cabinet meeting at the White House .\nMORE ON THE NEW OMB CHIEF : ABC 's Matthew Larotonda and Devin Dwyer report that if confirmed by the Senate , this will be Sylvia Matthews Burwell 's second stint at OMB , having served there as a deputy to its former director , Jack Lew , during Bill Clinton 's presidency in 1998 . She first came to the White House after working in Clinton 's 1992 election campaign and leading his economic transition team into the Oval Office . She also served as a deputy chief of staff under Erskine Bowles and in Treasury during that administration . Burwell currently leads the Walmart Foundation , the retailer 's charity division , and previously ran the global development wing of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . http : //abcn.ws/Z8GJc5\nWHERE IN THE WORLD IS JOE BIDEN ? Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at AIPAC 's annual Policy Conference in Washington , DC this morning .\nABC 's RICK KLEIN : Now the sequester moves to the real world . The massive budget cuts will be or wo n't be felt in small ways in the short term , and maybe in big ways eventually . The White House did itself few favors by exaggerating the early impact , which puts more pressure on the administration to be able to demonstrate what budget cuts will mean to people 's everyday lives . We stand now at a fiscal truce , borne of exhaustion . It will take some doing to wake people up - and even more to stir Washington over the sequester again .\nABC 's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE : Last week we saw a schism in the Republican Party when over 100 Republicans ( including Clint Eastwood ) signed a legal brief in support of same sex marriage , which goes against the party platform and the views of the GOP leadership . One of the four former Republican governors who signed the brief is ex-New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman who says there are days she `` absolutely '' does n't feel like part of the party because she says the GOP is being `` defined by the talking heads and they do n't for the most part represent me . '' Another Republican who is challenged more conservative elements in the party is Carlos Gutierrez , the former commerce secretary under George W. Bush . Gutierrez announced last week he is forming a new super PAC , Republicans for Immigration Reform . He says there are House members who `` understand we have to fix the problem '' of immigration , but `` the concern is they get primaried . '' Gutierrez told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , `` We will be very involved in the primary process for the House to give members cover\u2026If they have a rival from the right screaming amnesty or a primary challenger from the right screaming amnesty , those are the people we want to cover , we want to support and if that means going after the challenger that is screaming amnesty we will do that . '' http : //abcn.ws/VeK1Od\nABC 's EMILY FRIEDMAN : There were lots of revealing remarks made by Mitt and Ann Romney during their first interview since losing the election last fall , but one of the things that stood out to me most is just how relaxed they both seemed . Of course , the pressure is off now but the way Mitt and Ann interacted with each other during the interview - Ann joking that she had a moment of regret that she turned down an offer to be on `` Dancing with the Stars , '' and Mitt making sure Fox News ' Chris Wallace knew that his new grandchildren are n't actually named `` number 19 ? and `` number 20 ? - was interesting . It was even more so in light of Ann 's comment that she did n't feel like people got to `` know Mitt for who he was . '' It made me wonder if we - the media and in turn , the public - had been able to see even more of these candid moments , if the campaign would have turned out differently .\nABC 's MICHAEL FALCONE : After nearly four months of silence , now we have Mitt Romney 's own take on one of the biggest reasons he came up short to President Obama last November : `` The weakness that our campaign had and that I had is we were n't effective in taking my message primarily to minority voters , to Hispanic-Americans , African-Americans , other minorities , '' he told Fox News ' Chris Wallace . `` We did very well with the majority population , but not with minority populations . And that was a - that was a failing . That was a real mistake . '' Romney 's revelation is not exactly breaking news , but it 's worth noting that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus spent much of last week on a listening tour in three western states . `` On his west coast swing he conducted listening sessions with various groups in each city : African Americans , Asians , Hispanic , tech leaders , and grassroots activists , '' a committee official noted . `` On Friday , the Chairman sponsored the RNC 's first annual luncheon honoring Black Republican Trailblazers at the Capitol Hill Club . ''\nROMNEY ON HIS WHITE HOUSE LOSS : 'IT KILLS ME NOT TO BE THERE . ' A reflective Mitt Romney blamed his loss in the presidential election last November to his inability to connect with minorities , the former Republican nominee admitting to Fox News ' Chris Wallace that it still `` kills him '' not to be in Washington , ABC 's Emily Friedman reports . In this interview , his first since losing to President Obama , the former Massachusetts governor who received 47 percent of the vote to the president 's 51 percent , spoke candidly about his disappointment on election night . Romney said it was a `` slow recognition '' that he 'd lost the campaign , but when Florida was reported to be a close race - a state his campaign thought they 'd win easily - he began to realize his odds of winning were waning . `` We were convinced we would win , '' Romney said . `` My heart said we were going to win . `` It 's hard , it 's emotional , '' he said . `` There was such passion in the people who were helping us , I just felt we 'd really let them down . '' Ann Romney added that she cried on election night , and though she described herself as being `` mostly over '' the loss , she confessed that she still cries . `` I mourn the fact that he 's not [ in the White House ] , '' she said . `` I totally believe if Mitt were there in the office we would not be facing sequestration . '' Romney , who taped the interview in the San Diego home of his youngest son Craig earlier in the week , said bluntly , `` I still care , '' when asked what life is like watching business in Washington go on without him . `` I wish I were there , '' he said . `` It kills me to not be there , to not be in the White House doing what needs to be done . '' http : //abcn.ws/XBdJvC\nDENNIS RODMAN : KIM JONG UN WANTS PRESIDENT OBAMA TO 'CALL HIM . ' In his first interview since returning to the U.S. from an unprecedented visit to North Korea last week , former NBA star Dennis Rodman said he bears a message for President Obama from the country 's oppressive leader , Kim Jong Un . `` He wants Obama to do one thing : Call him , '' Rodman told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos on `` This Week . '' `` He said , 'If you can , Dennis - I do n't want [ to ] do war . I do n't want to do war . ' He said that to me . '' ABC 's Kari Rea and Julie Percha report that the athlete also offered Kim some diplomatic advice for potential future talks with President Obama . `` [ Kim ] loves basketball . And I said the same thing , I said , 'Obama loves basketball . ' Let 's start there , '' Rodman said . Rodman 's comments come just days after the basketball star shocked the world with an unexpected trip to Pyongyang , North Korea , becoming the first known American to publicly meet with the mysterious Kim since he assumed command of the totalitarian nation after the death of his father , Kim Jong-Il in 2011 . The young leader has defied U.N. sanctions by continuing to develop North Korea 's nuclear arms and missile program , which he says is aimed at the U.S. Kim is often regarded as one of the world 's most oppressive leaders , presiding over prison camps and allowing millions of his own people to starve . http : //abcn.ws/XLTuMJ\nKELLY AYOTTE KEEPS DOOR OPEN FOR 'BIG AGREEMENT ' ON BUDGET . While the White House and Congress failed to reach an agreement to avoid automatic spending cuts that began taking effect on March 1 , Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , said she is still open to the idea of a `` big agreement '' to address the country 's long-term fiscal challenges , as long as it addresses both tax reform and entitlement reform . `` If we 're going to increase revenue again it 's got to go to the debt with real entitlement reform and real tax reform , where you actually lower rates , '' Ayotte told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos yesterday on `` This Week . '' `` Absolutely I think we need to do a big agreement for the country . Because we have n't dealt with the fundamental drivers of our debt . '' When asked if she would accept a larger agreement that raises tax revenues , Ayotte said she would not agree to tax increases that `` increase more government , '' but only if they are applied to reducing the debt . `` I am willing to say if we take the form of lowering rates , so that we can focus on economic growth , and then we take a portion of that and apply it to the debt with real entitlement reform - but it has to go to the debt , '' Ayotte said . `` This sequester has to be dealt with within existing spending and alternative cuts , and we need real entitlement reform and real tax reform . That 's what we need for the country if we 're going to drive down our debt and also be focused on economic growth . '' http : //abcn.ws/15roXpL\nANALYSIS : BUDGET FIGHT BECOMES PRESIDENT OBAMA 'S BIG GAMBLE . President Obama 's budget gamble has only gotten bigger , even as Washington 's response to the self-inflicted crisis has gotten smaller , writes ABC 's Rick Klein . Now that the sequester has gone into effect , the president is in the awkward place of rooting for it to be felt as he and his administration have predicted . Beyond that , the president 's vision for governance is being put to an extraordinary test . With the two sides drained and declaring something of a weary truce , the president 's entire strategy for restoring the latest cuts depends on the public rising up and rejecting cuts to government services . `` The question is , can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing ? '' Obama said Friday . If pressure forces the GOP-led House to capitulate , the president may yet win the war with tea party forces that have irrevocably altered the course of his time in office . Get the public engaged in this fight enough to convince Republicans who 've worked with the president on virtually nothing , and that 's a bright spot in a beleaguered Washington . If he loses this battle , though , he 'll find himself locked in perpetual spending crises at least through next year 's congressional elections . The president may ultimately have to cater to Republican demands for even deeper spending cuts , with new tax revenues all but off the table . http : //abcn.ws/XMYG2T\n@ Chris_Moody : Fun piece from @ meredithshiner on the secret world of the Senate gym http : //www.rollcall.com/news/behind_the_doors_of_the_senate_gym-222790-1.html ? pos=hftxt \u2026\n@ CoralMDavenport : VA 2013 Gov . race is the next battleground in the political war over # climate change . http : //njour.nl/WqzPUn\n@ JHoganGidley : Excited to join my friend and colleague @ alicetweet this morning on her new radio show .
