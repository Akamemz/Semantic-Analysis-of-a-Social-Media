''\n`` It may have been words to the effect of coming 'to party ' in New York , '' Kelly said .\nThe man who was carjacked and held hostage -- allegedly by the Tsarnaev brothers -- just outside Boston last week said he thought he heard the two men say `` Manhattan '' in their conversation , the commissioner said .
