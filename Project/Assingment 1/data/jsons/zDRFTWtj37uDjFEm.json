    "content": "The campaign ad is hardly subtle : It offers a vision of hope and change , dismisses the scare tactics of an established candidate and insists that the old guard has \u201c already had their chance . \u201d\n\u201c You have the strength to make a change . \u2026 This is the time for something new , \u201d the spot says .\nThe yes-we-can message may sound familiar to Americans who followed the 2008 presidential election \u2014 except that this time it \u2019 s delivered in Hebrew .\nNearly seven years after Barack Obama won the White House , his tech-savvy tactics and messaging strategy from 2008 continue to resonate in political campaigns across the globe . The latest case is Israel , where elections are set for March 17 . There , a grass-roots outfit known as \u201c Victory 2015 \u201d \u2014 V15 for short \u2014 is micro-targeting voters and pursuing a digital-first strategy in a country that \u2019 s used to seeing elections play out over the television airwaves . V15 has even tapped a former top Obama campaign aide for help .\n\u201c People talk about the Obama campaign quite a lot , \u201d said V15 co-founder Nimrod Dweck , 33 . \u201c For me as an Israeli , I \u2019 m looking and saying , all right , it is possible to do an actual change . \u201d\nV15 \u2019 s goal is to unseat hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , whose recent decision to deliver a speech before Congress at the invitation of Republican House Speaker John Boehner \u2014 without White House buy-in \u2014 has prompted unusually high tensions between his government and the Obama administration . Some Democratic lawmakers are planning to skip the March 3 speech , and the fallout has raised concerns within the American Jewish community .\nV15 is not allowed to coordinate with or endorse any campaign , but its chief beneficiary will likely be leading Netanyahu rival Isaac Herzog , who represents a more liberal alliance called the Zionist Union . Herzog has been hammering Netanyahu for stoking conflict with the speech , which is expected to , in effect , criticize the White House \u2019 s decision to pursue nuclear negotiations with Iran .\nNetanyahu is favored to win reelection , and Obama himself is not especially popular in Israel . But V15 hopes it can cut into the prime minister \u2019 s margin by getting more center-left voters to turn out . The group \u2019 s strategy \u2014 and the parallels with the Obama campaign \u2014 go beyond simply calling for hope and change , though those terms are frequently invoked in V15 \u2019 s campaign literature .\nIn 2008 , for instance , the Obama campaign accused primary rival Hillary Clinton of playing on \u201c peoples \u2019 fears to scare up votes \u201d after a Clinton ad suggested she would be best-equipped to handle 3 a.m. crises . In a similar vein , V15 is dismissive of Netanyahu \u2019 s experience and near-singular focus on a muscular defense .\n\u201c Your fear is good for them , \u201d intones a campaign ad that intersperses ominous images of the prime minister with more hopeful scenes of daily life , such as people dancing , painting and playing music . \u201c But it \u2019 s not you that \u2019 s afraid . It \u2019 s [ they ] who are afraid of you . \u201d\nBoth V15 and Herzog also have suggested that new leadership would improve Israel \u2019 s ties with the U.S. \u2014 just as Obama promised to improve America \u2019 s relations with the rest of the world following the presidency of George W. Bush . Herzog , while no dove , has also said that , if elected , he would resume peace talks with the Palestinians .\nV15 has around 45 full-time staffers , and it says 10,000 people have volunteered to work on the campaign . It also has signed on Jeremy Bird , who served as national field director for Obama \u2019 s 2012 campaign . Bird \u2019 s firm , 270 Strategies , has been helping V15 target voters and improve its ground game .\nBird , who studied abroad in Israel during college , visited the country recently to help implement a canvassing program . His image was splashed across some Israeli newspapers .\nThe 36-year-old , whose firm has worked with Ready for Hillary , the organization pushing a Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign , wasn \u2019 t made available for interview , but he said of V15 in a statement : \u201c We \u2019 re inspired by their passion \u2014 that \u2019 s why we were honored to be asked by V15 and its partners to share best practices in organizing so they can maximize their impact both online and on the ground . \u201d\nAmerican campaign tactics are increasingly being deployed in other countries , sometimes shepherded by other Obama alums , such as in the United Kingdom . In India \u2019 s 2014 election , political parties used some of the tech-driven outreach tactics that helped propel Obama to the White House .\nU.S. consultants have been involved in Israeli campaigns since well before Obama rose to national prominence .\nIn 1999 , a cast of prominent Democratic operatives , some tied to then-U.S. President Bill Clinton , helped unseat Netanyahu . They included pollster Stan Greenberg and operatives James Carville and Bob Shrum . Netanyahu , who served from 1996 to 1999 and then again from 2009 through today , is the second-longest-serving prime minister in Israel \u2019 s 66-year history , following founding leader David Ben-Gurion .\nA number of Americans beyond Bird are involved in this year \u2019 s Israeli election : Netanyahu \u2019 s party , Likud , has hired Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul \u2019 s digital strategist , Vincent Harris . On the other side , longtime Clinton ally Paul Begala is advising Herzog . Democratic operative Mark Mellman is advising the centrist party Yesh Atid .\nObservers say that while Israel is home to a vibrant start-up culture and plenty of digital know-how , the country of 8 million hasn \u2019 t yet seen data drive politics the way it increasingly does in U.S. elections . That \u2019 s what V15 is hoping to change .\nBird \u2019 s firm declined to say how many staffers it has assigned to the V15 project . V15 has about 20 people working on a data team , which is focused on identifying targets for get-out-the-vote efforts . It took statistics from previous elections , combined that with demographic data and incorporated that into software that dictates where to focus its outreach .\n\u201c We managed to actually do a real mapping of Israel : Where we should operate , how much manpower is needed , how much door-to-door [ we should do ] , \u201d Dweck said . \u201c 270 helped us introduce metrics into how many doors were opened and conversations engaged . \u201d\nBut for all of V15 \u2019 s enthusiasm , the bulk of the campaigning is still driven by the major parties , rather than by outside groups . In this instance , that means efforts by Likud vs. the more liberal Zionist Union , an alliance of center-left parties .\n\u201c Israel is a very small country , the size of New Jersey , and any serious outreach efforts can have some marginal effect , \u201d said Natan Sachs , an expert on Israeli politics at the Brookings Institution . \u201c But generally , it \u2019 s small . Israelis are very engaged in politics , the Israeli parties are very adept at reaching their audiences . \u201d\nV15 was connected to 270 Strategies through the pro-peace group OneVoice , with which 270 Strategies has done some work and which is now an official V15 partner in Israel .\nOneVoice , which also has an American branch , was founded by Daniel Lubetzky , who heads Kind healthy snacks , known for its granola bars . Lubetzky is a major contributor to V15 , as is S. Daniel Abraham , a prominent American Jewish billionaire who served as the chairman of Slim-Fast .\nV15 , which accepts foreign donations , is not supposed to coordinate with or endorse any campaign . Still , Netanyahu \u2019 s Likud allies have accused it of coordinating with Herzog \u2019 s camp and otherwise violating campaign laws ; V15 denies wrongdoing ( and Israel \u2019 s attorney general tossed out a Likud effort to disqualify the group , though it said V15 could face scrutiny over donors following the election ) .\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York , both Republicans , have questioned whether a State Department-approved grant to OneVoice constituted an Obama-led \u201c political campaign against \u201d Netanyahu .
