    "content": "You can say goodbye to the # MeToo movement . It had a good three-year run , but inevitably , hypocrisy and political expediency caught up with it .\nNinety-five Hollywood supporters of the # MeToo movement smeared now-SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh over flimsy sexual assault allegations in 2018 in an attempt to block his Supreme Court appointment . But now that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden has sexual assault allegations of his own -- allegations with more corroborating evidence than the claims against Kavanugh at least -- these celebs \u2019 appeals to believing victims no matter what have seemed to dry up . Some of them are even defending Biden and calling his accuser a liar .\nBig names like Lady Gaga , Ellen DeGeneres , Jamie Lee Curtis , and nearly 100 more celebrities have had nothing to say against the man running to prevent President Donald Trump \u2019 s 2020 re-election nor expressed any solidarity with the woman who claimed Biden assaulted her in 1993 . Not even several of the famous ladies belonging to female assault victims solidarity organization Time \u2019 s Up \u2014 like Jessica Chastain , Brie Larson , Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore \u2014 have offered a word of support to the alleged victim .\nThey weren \u2019 t so silent when conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh endured his Senate Judiciary Hearing in 2018 , every single one of these nearly 100 celebrities smeared him on social media . Many insisted he was an alcoholic , \u201c liar , \u201d committed \u201c sexual violence \u201d and deserved have his \u201c pesky penis \u201d cut off , while the rest of these 95 concerned citizens implied it by pledging belief in Blasey Ford \u2019 s testimony .\nBiden hasn \u2019 t been held to the same , or any real standard by his friends in Hollywood . It \u2019 s clear # MeToo has become a political weapon , not a moral awakening , as these virtue-signalling hypocrites sold it .\nPerhaps the worst offender in this is Alyssa Milano , whose pivot from defending one accuser to defending the accused was shocking . Milano , a leader of the # MeToo movement , pulled out all the stops in trying to get the public to see Brett Kavanaugh as a predator who assaulted Dr. Ford back in the \u2018 80s . In addition to dismissing the at-the time SCOTUS nominee as a liar and tweeting she believed Dr. Ford , she pulled stunts like sitting in the Senate building during the hearings and harassing Senator Susan Collins ( R-ME ) in her own office before the lawmaker voted to appoint the justice .\nShe sure seemed like she had female victims \u2019 backs -- or so she wanted us to think at the time .\nTwo years later , Alyssa Milano abandoned those standards in order to protect her preferred presidential candidate from assault allegations . Instead of providing a platform for Tara Reade \u2019 s claims , Milano kept quiet for almost a month after they broke . Only after enough public pressure did Milano acknowledge the allegations . However she rationalized her support for Biden in a Deadline op-ed , claiming the Reade/Biden situation was not as \u201c black and white \u201d as the Kavanaugh/Blasey Ford situation .\nThis is the same woman who tweeted in 2018 , \u201c You can \u2019 t pretend to be the party of the American people and then not support a woman who comes forward with her # MeToo story. \u201d Yikes , that did not age well .\nImagine you \u2019 re a Hollywood A-lister who has taken up the cause of a sexual assault awareness group that helped take down notorious serial-predator Harvey Weinstein . Wouldn \u2019 t you at the very least acknowledge , corroborated allegations against the person running to be the most powerful man in the world ? Well some of the ladies of female victims awareness org TIME \u2019 S UP still have yet to say anything about Reade \u2019 s accusations against Biden , but they all pledged undying support to Ford .\nJulianne Moore , Reese Witherspoon , Brie Larson , Kerry Washington , Jessica Chastain , America Ferrera , Natalie Portman , all members of TIME \u2019 S UP , have kept quiet about Tara Reade \u2019 s specific allegations since they broke . Not a hot look for the the group that revolutionized # MeToo politics . Reade herself called out the group on April 29 for having not paid attention to her .\nFox News reported Reade \u2019 s words : \u201c You should be able to have your voice heard without losing your career and losing your job . And that 's what your whole mission is about . Why do I not qualify for your mission ? Why , because my perpetrator is the leading Democrat ? Why does that exempt me from help ? ''\nIt \u2019 s a fair question . During the Kavanaugh hearings , actresses Moore and Ferrera participated in a PSA thanking Dr. Ford for her testimony of Kavanaugh \u2019 s \u201c sexual violence. \u201d Witherspoon tweeted against Kavanaugh . Larson tweeted , \u201c # BelieveSurvivors , \u201d and Washington tweeted , \u201c Women must be heard . Today I am wearing black in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford . # BelieveSurvivors # TIMESUP # StopKavanaugh . \u201d\nChastain posted her belief that Kavanaugh was the man that \u201c assaulted \u201d Ford and Portman told Variety that Kavanaugh \u2019 s appointment demonstrated \u201c how stacked \u201d the system is against women . But what makes Biden so different for these women ?\nSince Reade \u2019 s admonition of these A-listers , TIME \u2019 S UP President Tina Tchen has acknowledged the need \u201c for complete transparency into this [ Reade \u2019 s ] claim and the multiple claims against President Donald Trump. \u201d Hmm , sounds like a bit of a qualification there . Tchen also praised Biden \u2019 s May 1 denial to MSNBC \u2019 s Nicolle Wallce , saying \u201c Today , Vice President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves , something that the current president has never done . \u201d\nYeah they sympathize with Reade -- so they say -- but clearly they \u2019 re going easy on Biden and will deflect to Trump \u2019 s accusation if needs be .\nBette Midler \u2019 s journey from # believeallwomen to # doubtingvictims is another major example of # MeToo hypocrisy . During the Kavanaugh hearings , the Hocus Pocus actress made waves with her radically over-the-top appeal to female victimhood .\nHer empathy for Ford was apparently so great that in Sept 2018 she tweeted , \u201c \u2018 Women are the n-word of the world \u2019 \u201d -- a reference to a John Lennon and Yoko Ono song . She elaborated with her own words , writing , \u201c Raped , beaten , enslaved , married off , worked like dumb animals ; denied education and inheritance ; enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life IN SILENCE for THOUSANDS of years . \u201d\nOf course , even Midler recognized that this was a bit extreme , deleting the tweet later . Though without a doubt , Midler had proclaimed that she was a female ally who prided herself on giving assault victims the benefit of the doubt . Well , that is , until the guy running against Trump got hit with his own set of allegations .\nContrary to most of her quiet tinseltown colleagues , Midler attacked Reade \u2019 s 2020 allegations head on , accusing her of orchestrating a political hitjob against the man that needed to beat Trump in November . As some news outlets like MSNBC broke the month-long media silence on Reade \u2019 s allegations , Midler became annoyed . She tweeted , \u201c Why do the # Dems always twist themselves into pretzels over this shit ? We heard Donald Trump say \u2018 I grab 'em by the pussy ! \u2019 and no one made a peep ! Did n't seem to hurt him , but we have been paying ever since . Who is paying to # SWIFTBOAT Joe Biden ? ? \u201d\nSo much for believing victims . It seems she wants their stories buried , at least if we are judging by her Kavanaugh standard . In this case , wasn \u2019 t Midler doing her part in making another woman an \u201c n-word of the world ? \u201d\nOf course you can \u2019 t mention lefty hypocrisy without good ol \u2019 Debra Messing . The Will & Grace actress and sworn enemy of President Trump on Twitter got caught in a bit of # MeToo hot water when she tried to debunk Reade \u2019 s assault accusation against the former vice president on May 2 . According to Fox News , Messing retweeted to her \u201c 635,000 plus \u201d followers a Medium article doubting Reade \u2019 s integrity . But annoyed users guilted her into deleting it .\nSeveral users jumped on Messing \u2019 s post , asserting that she was \u201c shaming \u201d survivors . Intercept journalist Glenn Greenwald responded with a sarcastic tweet that said , \u201c Gee , I wonder why a woman might be reluctant to come forward with allegations against a powerful male Democratic politician. \u201d Another wrote , \u201c at this point Debra Messing is vying for Alyssa Milano \u2019 s position of useful idiot shaming survivors . \u201d\nThose charges proved troublesome for Messing who had just revealed a glaring double standard in her # MeToo values . Sure anyone might doubt Reade \u2019 s account but Messing had set the precedent that she believed all survivors during the Kavanaugh trial . During that fiasco , Messing tweeted , \u201c We call on Judge Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination immediately . We the people , regardless of political party , will not tolerate a man credibly accused of sexual violence by multiple women as our next Supreme Court Justice . # TIMESUP . \u201d\nFor Messing , Ford \u2019 s mere words were enough to convince her Kavanaugh was a rapist , but Reade \u2019 s corroborated evidence against Biden somehow isn \u2019 t worth anything . Even Deborah Ramirez \u2019 s flimsy claims against Kavanaugh were enough evidence for the actress in 2018 .\nNever one to break away from any of the day \u2019 s prevailing leftwing talking points , ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel slammed Brett Kavanaugh during his show in Sept. 2018 . The comedian butchered the SCOTUS nominee , saying , \u201c Hear me out on this : So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court , OK ? Well , in return , we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone . \u201d\nAnd when it came to Biden \u2019 s allegations , Kimmel was soft on the former vice president like the rest of the media . The host took some criticism for not asking Biden a single question about the allegation during their late night interview , which aired after Reade \u2019 s bombshell story resurfaced during a Rolling Stone podcast on March 25 , 2020 .\nCBS Late Late Show host James Corden made Brett Kavanaugh the brunt of his jokes during his October 4 , 2018 broadcast . Corden slammed Kavanaugh as an angry alcoholic , but like Jimmy Kimmel , Corden avoided any controversy with alleged abuser Biden .\nCorden interviewed the Democrat presidential candidate during his show on April 21 , 2020 , but did not mention anything about Biden \u2019 s allegations or Tara Reade during the segment . This was nearly a month after Reade \u2019 s allegations broke .\nIce Age actor John Leguizamo made a ridiculous about-face on his # MeToo politics from Kavanaugh to Biden . During the 2018 SCOTUS hearings , Leguizamo called the judge a \u201c liar \u201d in a facebook post , writing , \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t hire Kavanaugh to work shuffleboard court , never mind the Supreme Court . # liarliarpantsonfire . \u201d\nHowever , when Biden \u2019 s allegations started gaining traction , Leguizamo , a member of the Biden campaign \u2019 s Latin outreach group , took the candidate 's side . He jumped on articles that attempted to debunk Biden \u2019 s allegations , and shared them via Twitter writing , \u201c Biden is cleared ! Tara admitting it wasn \u2019 t assault ! . \u201d However when the Tara Reade story continued to gain traction , Leguizamo insisted that Reade \u2019 s claims be scrutinized more closely and even deflected to Trump \u2019 s own allegations .\nWhy couldn \u2019 t he give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt ?\nCurtis even blasted Biden for his part in Clarence Thomas \u2019 Supreme Court appointment in 1991 . Curtis tweeted in 2019 , \u201c Come on @ JoeBiden . Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE . The longer you wait the worse it gets . \u201d\nThough since Reade \u2019 s allegation , Curtis hasn \u2019 t posted about the subject on either Twitter or Instagram . Could her hands be tied because Joe Biden is most likely the Democrat presidential nominee ?\nMrs. Doubtfire screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer outed herself as a huge # MeToo hypocrite since the Biden allegations . During the Kavanaugh hearings , Singer tweeted , \u201c Mitch McConnell just stood on the Senate floor and called the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh liars . Somewhere in America a young woman was just sexually attacked . She hears him loud and clear . Vote . \u201d\nHowever , she made no such defense of Reade after her allegations against Biden resurfaced . She actually insinuated that Reade was a political plant , tweeting , \u201c So is Tara Reade/ \u2019 Jennifer \u2019 trying to impress Vladimir on behalf of Donald Trump/ \u2019 John Barron \u2019 ? \u201d When someone called her out for her double standard , she responded , \u201c Men lie . Women lie . People lie . Have always had a problem with a blanket \u2018 believe \u2019 approach . It devalues true victims . Women must be heard and listened to . I hope she gets the help she needs . \u201d\nSinger also shared an article with Twitter on May 11 that rationalized voting for Biden while believing Tara Reade \u2019 s allegations . According to the post , beating Trump is more important than punishing Biden for sexual assault , though Singer commented in her tweet that she \u2019 s still not convinced by Reade \u2019 s claims even though she agrees that Biden must win at all costs .\nLefty actress Patricia Arquette slammed Kavanaugh back in Sept. 2018 , quipping that \u201c The only think [ sic ] Kavanaugh should Judge are the beers at Octoberfest. \u201d She also agreed with now-disgraced anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti \u2019 s claim that the FBI must investigate Judge Kavanaugh over allegations . Arquette responded to Avenatti , lamenting that Kavanaugh \u2019 s victims will suffer \u201c the victim blaming and the \u2018 slut shaming \u2019 \u201d from his defenders .\nBut now that Biden has allegations , Arquette seems to have changed her tune on victims . She deflected from Reade \u2019 s allegations to those of Trump assault accusers on April 30 , insisting that MSNBC host Christ Hayes focus on those rather than the tough questions he had concerning Biden \u2019 s assault .\nAnd on May 2 , Arquette tweeted , \u201c Which Tara Reade do you want me to believe ? The one who last year said Biden touched her neck and made her feel uncomfortable Or this one ? \u201d Is Arquette \u201c shaming \u201d or \u201c victim blaming \u201d on this one ?\nLefty comedian Amy Schumer and supermodel Emily Ratajkowski made waves during the Kavanaugh hearing by getting arrested alongside 300 anti-Kavanaugh protestors . Ratajkowski tweeted Oct. 4 , \u201c Today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh , a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault . Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power . \u201d\nIn a video posted by TPUSA Chief Creative Officer Benny Johnson , Schumer can be seen being asked by police officers whether she had been arrested . The comedian says yes and calmly takes her place in line . The point is , these ladies clearly enjoyed their virtue-signalling for the sake of \u201c believing victims , \u201d however now that a leftwing nominee is accused we haven \u2019 t seen these ladies protest his nomination .\nApparently standing up for victims against the left \u2019 s only shot at beating Trump is not a good look .\nOf course it \u2019 s clear that the standard of \u201c # believeallwomen , \u201d -- that all-hallowed # MeToo mantra -- ended up only being a manipulative political weapon used against powerful men the left hated and put away when powerful lefty men were accused . In the end there was no benefit of the doubt for Biden \u2019 s accuser , Tara Reade , like there was for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , or even lamer accusers .\nRose McGowan , an actress , alleged Weinstein abuse victim and one of the few consistent # MeToo activists had the stones to call out this hypocrisy . She blasted Alyssa Milano and other two-faced lefties on April 29 , saying , \u201c You are a fraud . This is about holding the media accountable . You go after Trump & Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims , you are a lie . \u201d\nMcGowan added . \u201c You have always been a lie . The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade , so are you . SHAME. \u201d McGowan may be on to something , at the very least she \u2019 s right about the Hollywood double standard .\nSo much for privileged male predators being the threat to women . If they are liberal , the rules don \u2019 t apply .",

It seems she wants their stories buried, at least if we are judging by her Kavanaugh standard. In this case, wasn\u2019t Midler doing her part in making another woman an \u201cn-word of the world?\u201d\n\nDebra Messing\n\nOf course you can\u2019t mention lefty hypocrisy without good ol\u2019 Debra Messing. The Will & Grace actress and sworn enemy of President Trump on Twitter got caught in a bit of #MeToo hot water when she tried to debunk Reade\u2019s assault accusation against the former vice president on May 2. According to Fox News, Messing retweeted to her \u201c635,000 plus\u201d followers a Medium article doubting Reade\u2019s integrity.

Even Deborah Ramirez\u2019s flimsy claims against Kavanaugh were enough evidence for the actress in 2018.\n\nOther Famous #MeToo Hypocrites\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nNever one to break away from any of the day\u2019s prevailing leftwing talking points, ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel slammed Brett Kavanaugh during his show in Sept. 2018.

This was nearly a month after Reade\u2019s allegations broke.\n\nJohn Leguizamo\n\nIce Age actor John Leguizamo made a ridiculous about-face on his #MeToo politics from Kavanaugh to Biden. During the 2018 SCOTUS hearings, Leguizamo called the judge a \u201cliar\u201d in a facebook post, writing, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hire Kavanaugh to work shuffleboard court, never mind the Supreme Court. #liarliarpantsonfire.\u201d\n\nHowever, when Biden\u2019s allegations started gaining traction, Leguizamo, a member of the Biden campaign\u2019s Latin outreach group, took the candidate's side. He jumped on articles that attempted to debunk Biden\u2019s allegations, and shared them via Twitter writing, \u201cBiden is cleared! Tara admitting it wasn\u2019t assault!.\u201d However when the Tara Reade story continued to gain traction, Leguizamo insisted that Reade\u2019s claims be scrutinized more closely and even deflected to Trump\u2019s own allegations.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t he give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt?\n\nJamie Lee Curtis\n\nHalloween and Freaky Friday actress Jamie Lee Curtis scorned Kavanaugh in 2018, posting a mock picture of the U.S. Constitution being shredded on Instagram in response to the Justice\u2019s appointment. She captioned it, saying \u201cAppropriate and concerning. A call to action for us to protect the constitution and try to get the inclusion rider, the ERA added.\u201d\n\nCurtis even blasted Biden for his part in Clarence Thomas\u2019 Supreme Court appointment in 1991. Curtis tweeted in 2019, \u201cCome on @JoeBiden. Just CALL Anita Hill and then GO TO HER HOUSE and APOLOGIZE to her FACE. The longer you wait the worse it gets.\u201d\n\nThough since Reade\u2019s allegation, Curtis hasn\u2019t posted about the subject on either Twitter or Instagram. Could her hands be tied because Joe Biden is most likely the Democrat presidential nominee?\n\nRandi Mayem Singer\n\nMrs. Doubtfire screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer outed herself as a huge #MeToo hypocrite since the Biden allegations. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Singer tweeted, \u201cMitch McConnell just stood on the Senate floor and called the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh liars. Somewhere in America a young woman was just sexually attacked. She hears him loud and clear. Vote.\u201d\n\nHowever, she made no such defense of Reade after her allegations against Biden resurfaced. She actually insinuated that Reade was a political plant, tweeting, \u201cSo is Tara Reade/\u2019Jennifer\u2019 trying to impress Vladimir on behalf of Donald Trump/\u2019John Barron\u2019?\u201d When someone called her out for her double standard, she responded, \u201cMen lie. Women lie. People lie. Have always had a problem with a blanket \u2018believe\u2019 approach. It devalues true victims. Women must be heard and listened to. I hope she gets the help she needs.\u201d\n\nSinger also shared an article with Twitter on May 11 that rationalized voting for Biden while believing Tara Reade\u2019s allegations. According to the post, beating Trump is more important than punishing Biden for sexual assault, though Singer commented in her tweet that she\u2019s still not convinced by Reade\u2019s claims even though she agrees that Biden must win at all costs.\n\nSorry, Tara.\n\nPatricia Arquette\n\nLefty actress Patricia Arquette slammed Kavanaugh back in Sept. 2018, quipping that \u201cThe only think[sic] Kavanaugh should Judge are the beers at Octoberfest.\u201d She also agreed with now-disgraced anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti\u2019s claim that the FBI must investigate Judge Kavanaugh over allegations. Arquette responded to Avenatti, lamenting that Kavanaugh\u2019s victims will suffer \u201cthe victim blaming and the \u2018slut shaming\u2019\u201d from his defenders.\n\nBut now that Biden has allegations, Arquette seems to have changed her tune on victims. She deflected from Reade\u2019s allegations to those of Trump assault accusers on April 30, insisting that MSNBC host Christ Hayes focus on those rather than the tough questions he had concerning Biden\u2019s assault.\n\nAnd on May 2, Arquette tweeted, \u201cWhich Tara Reade do you want me to believe? The one who last year said Biden touched her neck and made her feel uncomfortable Or this one?\u201d Is Arquette \u201cshaming\u201d or \u201cvictim blaming\u201d on this one?\n\nAmy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski\n\nLefty comedian Amy Schumer and supermodel Emily Ratajkowski made waves during the Kavanaugh hearing by getting arrested alongside 300 anti-Kavanaugh protestors. Ratajkowski tweeted Oct. 4, \u201cToday I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted by TPUSA Chief Creative Officer Benny Johnson, Schumer can be seen being asked by police officers whether she had been arrested. The comedian says yes and calmly takes her place in line. The point is, these ladies clearly enjoyed their virtue-signalling for the sake of \u201cbelieving victims,\u201d however now that a leftwing nominee is accused we haven\u2019t seen these ladies protest his nomination.\n\nApparently standing up for victims against the left\u2019s only shot at beating Trump is not a good look.\n\nOf course it\u2019s clear that the standard of \u201c#believeallwomen,\u201d -- that all-hallowed #MeToo mantra -- ended up only being a manipulative political weapon used against powerful men the left hated and put away when powerful lefty men were accused. In the end there was no benefit of the doubt for Biden\u2019s accuser, Tara Reade, like there was for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, or even lamer accusers.\n\nRose McGowan, an actress, alleged Weinstein abuse victim and one of the few consistent #MeToo activists had the stones to call out this hypocrisy. She blasted Alyssa Milano and other two-faced lefties on April 29, saying, \u201cYou are a fraud. This is about holding the media accountable. You go after Trump & Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims, you are a lie.\u201d\n\nMcGowan added. \u201cYou have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you. SHAME.\u201d McGowan may be on to something, at the very least she\u2019s right about the Hollywood double standard.\n\nSo much for privileged male predators being the threat to women. If they are liberal, the rules don\u2019t apply.",
