Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst , a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University . He is the author of `` Manhunt : The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad . '' This article was originally published in May , 2015 .\n( CNN ) In his final years hiding in a compound in Pakistan , Osama bin Laden was a man who at once showed great love and interest in his own family while he coldly drew up quixotic plans for mass casualty attacks on Americans , according to documents seized by Navy SEALs the night he was killed .\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released an unprecedented number of documents from what U.S. officials have described as the treasure-trove picked up by the SEALs at bin Laden 's compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan , on May 2 , 2011 .\nTotaling 103 documents , they include the largest repository of correspondence ever released between members of bin Laden 's immediate family and significant communications between bin Laden and other leaders of al Qaeda as well as al Qaeda 's communications with terrorist groups around the Muslim world .\nAlso released was a list of bin Laden 's massive digital collection of English-language books , think tank reports and U.S. government documents , numbering 266 in total .\nTo the end bin Laden remained obsessed with attacking Americans . In an undated letter he told jihadist militants in North Africa that they should stop `` insisting on the formation of an Islamic state '' and instead attack U.S. embassies in Sierra Leone and Togo and American oil companies . Bin Laden offered similar advice to the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen , telling it to avoid targeting Yemeni police and military targets and instead prioritize attacks on American targets .\nMuch of bin Laden 's advice either did n't make it to these groups or was simply ignored because al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and North Africa continued to attack local targets .\nJUST WATCHED Author on bin Laden 's shelf : We interfere in Muslim world Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Author on bin Laden 's shelf : We interfere in Muslim world 02:52\nISIS , of course , did n't exist at the time bin Laden was writing . The group , which now controls a large swath of territory in the Middle East , grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq and has charted a different path , seeking to create an Islamic state and not prioritizing attacks on the United States and its citizens .\nTaken together , these documents and reading materials paint a complex , nuanced portrait of the world 's most wanted man in the years before he was killed in the raid on his compound .\nIn the letters that bin Laden exchanged with his many sons and daughters , he emerges as a much-loved and admired father who doted on his children . And in a letter he sent to one of his wives , he even comes off as a lovelorn swain .\nThat 's in sharp contrast to the letters bin Laden sent to al Qaeda leaders that demanded mass casualty attacks against American targets and insisted that al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East stop wasting their time on attacks against local government targets . `` The focus should be on killing and fighting the American people , '' bin Laden emphasized .\nBin Laden 's digital library is that of an avid reader whose tastes ran from `` Obama 's Wars , '' Bob Woodward 's account of how the Obama administration surged U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010 , to Noam Chomsky as well as someone who had a pronounced interest in how Western think tanks and academic institutions were analyzing al Qaeda .\nBin Laden was a meticulous editor , and some of the memos he wrote were revised as many as 50 times . Of the thousands of versions of documents recovered from computers and digital media that the SEALs retrieved at bin Laden 's compound , the final tally numbers several hundred documents .\nThe new documents show how bin Laden reacted to the events of the Arab Spring , which was roiling the Middle East in the months before his death . While bin Laden had nothing to say publicly about the momentous events in the Middle East , privately he wrote lengthy memos analyzing what was happening , pointing to the `` new factor '' of `` the information technology revolution '' that had helped spur the revolutions and characterizing them as `` the most important events '' in the Muslim world `` in centuries . ''\nSome of the documents paint an organization that understood it was under significant pressure from U.S. counterterrorism operations . One undated document explained that CIA drone attacks `` led to the killing of many jihadi cadres , leaders and others , '' and noted , `` ( T ) his is something that is concerning us and exhausting us . '' Several documents mention the need to be careful with operational security and to encrypt communications and also the necessity of making trips around the Afghan-Pakistan border regions only on `` cloudy days '' when American drones were less effective .\nAl Qaeda members knew they were short on cash , with one writing to bin Laden , `` Also , there is the financial problem . ''\nSome of the documents have nothing to do with terrorism . One lengthy memo from bin Laden worried about the baleful effects of climate change on the Muslim world and advocated not depleting precious groundwater stocks . Sounding more like a World Bank official than the leader of a major terrorist organization , bin Laden fretted about `` food security . '' He also gave elaborate instructions to an aide about the most efficacious manner to store wheat .\nMany of the documents concern bin Laden 's sprawling family , which included his four wives and 20 children . Bin Laden took a minute interest in the marriage plans of his son Khalid to the daughter of a `` martyred '' al Qaeda commander , and he exchanged a number of letters with the mother of the bride-to-be . Bin Laden excitedly described the impending nuptials , `` which our hearts have been looking forward to . ''\nBin Laden corresponded at length with his son Hamza and also with Hamza 's mother , Khairiah , who had spent around a decade in Iran under a form of house arrest following the Taliban 's fall in neighboring Afghanistan during the winter of 2001 .\nHamza wrote a heartfelt letter to bin Laden in 2009 in which he recalled how he had n't seen his father since he was 13 , eight years earlier : `` My heart is sad from the long separation , yearning to meet with you . ... My eyes still remember the last time I saw you when you were under the olive tree and you gave each one of us Muslim prayer beads . ''\nIn 2010 the Iranians started releasing members of the bin Laden family who had been living in Iran . Bin Laden spent many hours writing letters to them and to his associates in al Qaeda about how best he could reunite with them .\nBin Laden watches TV at his Abbottabad , Pakistan , compound in a frame grab from an undated video from the Pentagon .\nIn a letter to his wife Khairiah , he wrote tenderly , `` ( H ) ow long have I waited for your departure from Iran . ''\nBin Laden was paranoid that the Iranians -- who he said were `` not to be trusted '' -- might insert electronic tracking devices into the belongings or even the bodies of his family as they departed Iran . He told Khairiah that if she had recently visited an `` official dentist '' in Iran for a filling that she would need to have the filling taken out before meeting with him as he worried a tracking device might have been inserted inside .\nU.S. intelligence officials have a theory that bin Laden might have been grooming Hamza eventually to succeed him at the helm of al Qaeda because the son 's relative youth would energize al Qaeda 's base . But Hamza never made it to his father 's hiding place in Abbottabad . When the SEALs raided bin Laden 's compound , they assumed Hamza would likely be one of the adult males living there , but he was n't .\nU.S. intelligence officials say they do n't know where Hamza , now in his late 20s , is today .\nAs is typical for any bureaucratic organization there was considerable discussion in the documents about which al Qaeda personnel might be suitable for promotion and also documentation of cash flows moving in and out of the organization , in amounts in the tens of thousands of euros .\nThere is even an al Qaeda application form that included standard questions such as what `` hobbies '' the applicant might have , but also less standard ones such as , `` Who should we contact in case you became a martyr ? ''\nUnder pressure from bin Laden , leaders of al Qaeda in Yemen noodled with the idea that they might negotiate some kind of truce with the Yemeni government so the group could focus exclusively on attacking American targets . It 's not clear if anything came of this .\nSimilarly , al Qaeda members reached out to leaders of the Pakistani Taliban who maintain contacts with Pakistan 's military intelligence service , ISI , to see if they could negotiate a similar truce with the Pakistani government . The deal would be that the Pakistanis would leave al Qaeda alone and vice versa and then al Qaeda would be able to focus on attacking American targets . However , the al Qaeda leader who was leading this effort told bin Laden , `` As you know , this is just talk ! '' and nothing came of these discussions .\nThere is no evidence in the newly released documents that the Pakistanis had any idea bin Laden was living in Pakistan or indeed he was even alive .\nThe new documents also do nothing to substantiate investigative journalist 's Seymour Hersh 's recent well-publicized claims that the raid that killed bin Laden was not a firefight in which the SEALs went into a dangerous and unknown situation , but a setup in which Pakistan 's military had been holding bin Laden prisoner in Abbottabad for five years and simply made him available to the SEALs when they flew in helicopters to the compound on the night of the raid .\nOn the first anniversary of bin Laden 's death in May 2012 , the Obama administration released a first tranche of 17 documents from the treasure-trove . Those documents also underlined how much al Qaeda feared the CIA drone campaign as well as bin Laden 's obsessive interest in attacking the United States .\nJUST WATCHED Bergen : Hersh 's account of bin Laden raid is nonsense Replay More Videos ...

Readers can judge for themselves by examining the English-language translations of the new documents and also the original Arabic documents here\nAccording to U.S. intelligence officials , in October seven U.S. intelligence agencies began the process of clearing for public release the documents that came out Wednesday .\nAmong the most interesting windows in to the mind of al Qaeda 's leader are the contents of his massive digital library , which was painstakingly assembled . Because of security concerns , bin Laden 's compound had no connection to the Internet so any books or reports that bin Laden had an interest in were assembled painstakingly by making PDFs of each page .

This remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin Laden in the remote hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin Laden lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz.
