Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is calling for the public release of \"all backup and source documentation\" related to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after a discrepancy surfaced in source documents provided by the special counsel's office.\n\nWhat are the details?\n\nNunes' reaction came after the public release of a Nov. 2017 voicemail transcript from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to the attorney representing former national security adviser Michael Flynn in which Dowd asked Flynn's attorney for a \"heads up\" if Flynn knew material damaging to the president.\n\nThe transcript released Friday included new content that was not included in Mueller's source documentation.\n\n\"It's all a fraud,\" Nunes said.\n\nSide-by-side comparison shows documentation provided by Mueller left out crucial contextual details, including where Dowd explicitly said he was not asking for \"any confidential information\" and when Dowd said his request was \"not only for the president but for the country.\"\n\n\n\nHere's the complete Dowd transcript:\n\nHey, Rob, uhm, this is John again.
