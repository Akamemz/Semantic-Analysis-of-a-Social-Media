    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump has reason to hope his luck is changing after a long legal losing streak .\nTrump got to celebrate a big win Wednesday in an emoluments clause case relating to his Washington hotel . And there are signs that a case in Louisiana could cause yet another near death experience for Obamacare , his predecessor 's top domestic achievement .\nThe courtroom action this week represents a potential reversal of fortune for Trump following a long list of defeats the President has tasted on cases from immigration to the 2020 census to his efforts to thwart Democratic oversight to his central campaign promise to build a border wall . For a man who bills himself as one of life 's ultimate winners , Trump 's legal losing record is a branding nightmare .\nYet the intimate relationship between this President and the courts actually goes beyond the win-loss calculation that normally powers Trump 's life . The judicial system serves multi-dimensional roles for Trump in his personal , business and Washington life .\nWhile the law has often frustrated Trump 's political goals , he has still used it as a weapon to combat Democrats , as the glue in his conservative coalition and to postpone threatening political crises .\nOften -- as in the case of Trump 's national emergency declaration designed to fund his border wall or the census -- it seems as if the long odds in court do not deter the President . The law gives Trump another venue for the endless fights that sustain his politics and his personality . Even if he loses he is showing his supporters he 's never giving up the battle .\nTrump 's judicial appointments are likely to shape the character of American life for years after he 's left the White House . And it 's still possible court rulings could pose an existential threat to his personal and business legacy given the flurry of cases currently open in New York .\nAs is often the case , Trump 's wins in the courts have been outnumbered by his losses this week .\nThe administration has just tumbled to defeat before different judges -- including in the Supreme Court -- on its attempts to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census .\nTwo significant court rulings in May upheld Congress in its battle to subvert Trump 's war on oversight over Democratic lawmakers ' efforts subpoena his financial records .\nTrump has also tasted defeat in huge cases on immigration -- slowing or thwarting his efforts to build his border wall , and right at the start of his term on his original travel ban . The Supreme Court has since allowed parts of a rewritten plan to stand .\nResearch by the Center for Policy Integrity at the University of New York School of Law showed that the administration had won only three of 42 deregulatory cases , a paltry success rate of only 7 % .\nYet Trump 's relationship with the courts is actually far more complicated than the win-loss ratio with which he judges his own success and that of everyone around him .\nIn decades as a businessman Trump was the initiator and the target of thousands of lawsuits . He used the courts to try to extricate himself from dicey situations , as a weapon in negotiations and to test the legal limits of business practice .\nHe used lawsuits to save face , to offer a new venue to prolong a fight , to put off a reckoning or agreed out-of-court settlements to limit the costs of personal and business liabilities .\nAs President , Trump has also used courts to fulfill wider goals than simply winning and losing cases , especially since he 's struggled to get many major bills through Congress -- apart from a big tax reform program .\nWith bold assertions of executive power , Trump has made the courts a constant presence in his presidency .\nWhen he 's won , he 's trumpeted it . When -- more often -- he loses , the judgments become exhibits in his foundational political case that an elite establishment is out to get him and that he 's being treated unfairly .\n`` So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case ( Are you a Citizen of the United States ? ) wo n't let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use .
