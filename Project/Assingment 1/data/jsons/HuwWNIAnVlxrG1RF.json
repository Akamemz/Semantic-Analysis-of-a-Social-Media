    "content": "Early in October , Trey Gowdy , the notorious chairman of the House select-committee investigating Benghazi , sent a letter to Elijah Cummings , the ranking Democrat on the committee , accusing Hillary Clinton of sending an email containing the name of a highly classified CIA source . The email was allegedly forwarded by Clinton to someone on her staff .\nIf you automatically assumed the story would end up being a great big nothingburger , not unlike nearly everything else the GOP has conjured recently , you assumed correctly . It turns out the CIA investigated the email and determined there was n't any classified information revealed after all , a fact which Cummings fired back to Gowdy in a Sunday letter to the controversial chairman .\nCummings wrote , `` The CIA [ on Saturday ] informed both the Republican and Democratic staffs of the Select Committee that they do not consider the information you highlighted in your letter to be classified . Specifically , the CIA confirmed that the State Department consulted with the CIA on this production , the CIA reviewed these documents , and the CIA made no redactions to protect classified information . ''\nThe tenacious chairman outed the name of the CIA agent in his response to Cummings . In what was clearly a rookie email mistake , the name of the agent was redacted in the body of the email , yet according to Yahoo ! News it was n't redacted in the subject-line of the note . In other words , while Clinton may have privately forwarded the not-classified name to an aide , Gowdy publicly revealed the agent 's name while simultaneously accusing Clinton of doing the same . Whoops , again .\nAgain , there 's really no reason to be surprised that Gowdy 's accusation turned out to be wishful thinking . And , no , Cummings ' request for an apology wo n't be answered in kind . The GOP 's business model forbids it . Simply put , the model goes like this : make stuff up and never apologize . The calculus is arguably the most cynical brand of politics imaginable . Knowing how a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on , the GOP has been remarkably successful at unapologetically injecting total hooey into the discourse , only for it to metastasize as reality in spite of countless fact-checks to the contrary .\nWhile the Republican frontrunners , including and especially Jeb Bush , continue to spread falsehoods about the September 11 , 2012 Benghazi attacks , there continues to be a steady stream of debunkery that previously or , in some cases , has concurrently accompanied the lies . For instance , on the same telecast , NBC News ' Andrea Mitchell debunked Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo 's claims about the relationship between Hillary Clinton and one of her longtime advisers , Sidney Blumenthal .\nPOMPEO : Well , we have focused on the central failure . We have focused on the security issues . And we will continue , you \u2019 ll see lots of questions about that on Thursday . But let me speak to Mr. Blumenthal . Because directly to the security issue , we see now that former Secretary Clinton relied on Mr. Blumenthal for most of her intelligence . That if she wants to rely -- MITCHELL : That is factually not true . POMPEO : No , it is absolutely true . MITCHELL : Relied on Mr. Blumenthal for most of her intelligence ? POMPEO : Ms. Mitchell , take a look at the email trails and you will see -- MITCHELL : That \u2019 s just -- I cover the State Department .
