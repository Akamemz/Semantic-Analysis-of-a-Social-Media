The Democrat is crisscrossing the country , trying to convince donors and power brokers from New York to Chicago to contribute to his long-shot bid to become the first African-American senator from Mississippi since Reconstruction .\nRaising money out of state is crucial for many candidates , but it \u2019 s even more critical for Espy , whose core supporters in Mississippi 's rural communities lack the deep pockets to help him mount a robust challenge to his two Republican rivals .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have any choice but to go to those havens and those venues of people who are probably going to be Democrats , who are likely to find resonance with my approach and give to me politically , \u201d Espy said .\nSome political observers said Espy has a shot , but it \u2019 s an uphill battle in the ruby-red state , and his chances largely depend on boosting African-American turnout and capitalizing on the fierce battle between his Republican opponents .\n\u201c I hate to put a percentage on it , but I think it \u2019 s reasonable to discuss \u2013 there is a path forward for Espy to score an upset , \u201d said Nathan Shrader , co-chair of Millsaps College Political Science Department . \u201c If he can boost traditional Democratic turnout to look more like a presidential-year turnout than a midterm , then he \u2019 s in this thing . \u201d\nEspy , a former congressman and U.S. secretary of agriculture under the Clinton administration , is running in a special election to replace Republican Thad Cochran , who retired in April . Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith , who was appointed to fill Cochran \u2019 s unexpired term , and state Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel are the other top contenders .\nThe nonpartisan contest Nov. 6 is likely to go to a runoff between the top two vote getters Nov. 27 .\nEspy said his campaign got a boost from the wins of other African-American Democrats in statewide races , including the gubernatorial bid of Stacey Abrams in Georgia .\nIt also helped that in neighboring Alabama , Doug Jones pulled off an upset last December to become the first Democrat in 25 years to represent the state in the U.S. Senate .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a time when Republicans can \u2019 t take a lot for granted , particularly because if Democrats can win a Senate race in Alabama , they can hypothetically win one in Mississippi , \u2019 \u2019 Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said . \u201c The race is getting attention and probably merits attention . \u201d\nEspy is taking advantage of that attention , traveling to Chicago and New York City for fundraisers and returning this week to Washington , where he will meet with potential donors in a supporter \u2019 s living room .\nEspy said it \u2019 s hard to raise the money he needs in Mississippi , where the 19.8 percent poverty rate is the highest in the country .\nHe hopes to raise at least $ 3 million . By the end of June , he had collected $ 408,236 and had $ 281,000 in his coffers , according to the Federal Election Commission .\nEspy said fundraising picked up in the past month \u201c as people see that the Democrats are doing better in Senate races around the country , as people begin to feel the urgency of the fact that control of the Senate just might depend on the results of this race . \u201d\nEspy asked Jones for campaign tips when they crossed paths this summer .\n\u201c I picked his very fertile brain , and I learned a lot from him , and I \u2019 ve hired a lot of his people , \u201d Espy said .\nEspy \u2019 s team includes Joe Trippi as media adviser and Rich McDaniel to handle his get-out-the-vote strategy .\nDespite similarities in their campaigns , Espy said there are differences . He said Mississippi has 13,000 more registered black voters .\n\u201c On paper , we start with a better scenario than Doug Jones started with in Alabama , \u201d he said .\nIn Mississippi , blacks make up nearly 38 percent of the population versus 27 percent in Alabama . Black voters helped Jones defeat Republican Roy Moore .\nEspy not only has to convince blacks to support him , but , like Jones , must appeal to whites . Espy said he talks about issues important to all Mississippians , including access to affordable health care .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a hard sell because they all want the same thing whether you \u2019 re African-American or white or you \u2019 re concerned about rural hospitals closing , \u201d he said .\nJones , who spoke this year at a Mississippi Democratic Party event , said Espy can win .\n\u201c The same energy that we saw in Alabama I \u2019 ve seen in Mississippi , \u201d he said . \u201c Mike starts out with a really strong base .
