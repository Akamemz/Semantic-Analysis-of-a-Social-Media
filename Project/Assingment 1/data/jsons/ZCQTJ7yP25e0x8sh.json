    "content": "President Obama is taking a hit from anti-drug groups for downplaying the effects of marijuana use , as some point out his recent comments appear to clash with statements by his own health and law enforcement agencies .\nThe president , in a recent interview with The New Yorker , likened pot to cigarettes and alcohol .\n`` As has been well documented , I smoked pot as a kid , and I view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life . I do n't think it is more dangerous than alcohol , '' Obama said .\nHe added that smoking marijuana is `` not something I encourage '' and is `` a bad idea , a waste of time , not very healthy . ''\nBut anti-drug and public health organizations have since seized on the remarks , claiming the president is giving a muddy picture of the medical downsides of marijuana .\n`` His laissez-faire attitude about legalization has drug policy and prevention experts scratching their heads in confusion as to why the President will not give clear guidance on this important issue , '' The Drug-Free America Foundation said on its website .\n`` President Obama is surrounded by a myriad of experts who have voiced serious concerns about the harms of marijuana and rejected legalization , so either he is seriously ill-informed about the issue or is completely ignoring warnings from his highly-esteemed advisers . ''\nObama 's comments were made to the backdrop of Colorado and Washington state legalizing and regulating marijuana . His remarks could be taken as another signal that his administration will not interfere with their experiment -- though recreational marijuana use remains illegal under federal law .\nThe president echoed the argument that pro-legalization advocates often make , stressing the cost to society of locking up minor drug offenders .\n`` Middle-class kids do n't get locked up for smoking pot , and poor kids do , '' Obama said . `` And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties . ''\nBut his administration , and those of his predecessors , repeatedly have documented and publicized health risks from the drug .\nObama 's own Office of National Drug Control Policy still states on its website that the administration `` steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs . ''\nThe office lists a range of negative health and mental consequences from the drug , including schizophrenia , lower IQ ( `` as much as an 8 point drop '' ) , and higher risk of heart attack .\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse says the drug is addictive , with nearly 4.2 million people having a pot abuse or addiction problem in 2011 .\nThe agency says the drug is linked to `` school failure '' and high doses `` can cause psychosis or panic when you 're high . ''\nThe American Society of Addiction Medicine released a statement on Tuesday noting that the drug impairs memory , motor function and respiratory health when smoked -- and can be addictive .\n`` Addiction is a chronic brain disease that can affect people at any age . In fact , the younger one initiates alcohol or drug use , the greater the likelihood that he or she has addictive disease , '' ASAM President Stuart Gitlow said .\nA recurring rebuttal to the president 's comments is that weed today is stronger than it was when , say , Obama smoked it .\nThe White House drug office says studies show the potency has `` almost tripled over the past 20 years . ''\nThe president attracted a rebuke along those lines from former Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy , who told MSNBC that Obama 's director in charge of drug abuse would tell him `` that , in fact , today 's modern , genetically modified marijuana -- so it 's much higher THC levels -- far surpass the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person .
