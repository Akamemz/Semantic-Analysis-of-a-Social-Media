Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris , Beto O'Rourke , Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker also chart . Adam Wilson , Wochit\nDES MOINES , Iowa \u2013 Joe Biden has yet to enter the 2020 presidential race \u2013 he \u2019 s been weighing the decision in a closely watched will-he-or-won \u2019 t-he saga \u2013 but the former vice president still leads the pack in Iowa .\nAccording to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers , 27 percent say Biden is their first choice for president . That \u2019 s down slightly from the 32 percent who said the same in December , but it tops the 19 other declared and potential candidates tested .\nBiden has a 2 percentage point advantage over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . Though that \u2019 s within the poll \u2019 s 4.9 percentage point margin of error , other numbers bode well for the former vice president and suggest a stronger advantage over Sanders . The poll of 401 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted March 3 through 6 .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m Joe Biden sitting on the fence and I see this poll , this might make me want to jump in , \u201d said J. Ann Selzer , president of the Des Moines-based Selzer & Co. , which conducted the poll . \u201c I just can \u2019 t find much in this poll that would be a red flag for Joe Biden . \u201d\nSeventy percent of respondents say they believe Biden \u2019 s political views are neither too liberal nor too conservative , but instead , are \u201c about right \u201d \u2013 the highest percentage of any candidate tested .\nAnd 64 percent \u2013 including a majority in every demographic group \u2013 say they think Biden \u2019 s experience is an asset and that he should enter the race . About a third of respondents say his time has passed and he should not run .\n\u201c He \u2019 s got a lot of years of political experience \u2013 being a senator for over 35 years , being the vice president , \u201d said Travis Underwood , a 30-year-old Ottumwa resident and poll respondent who said Biden is his first choice for president . \u201c And he \u2019 s very charismatic . It seems like today we \u2019 re in an era where it \u2019 s all partisan politics . There are not too many out there who are middle-of-the-road . Biden is moderate , and that means he actually talks about issues . \u201d\nBiden has spent months mulling whether to make a third run at the White House after failed bids in 1988 and 2008 \u2013 setting deadlines for himself and then blowing past them . But a decision now appears imminent . According to a report from The New York Times , one Biden strategist has been telling Democrats that Biden is 95 percent committed to running .\nFeb. 13 : How long can Joe Biden , Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke afford to wait to jump into 2020 race ?\nSanders formally announced his candidacy last month and visited Iowa for the first time as a declared 2020 candidate this month . According to the poll , 25 percent now say Sanders is their first choice for president \u2013 up 6 percentage points since December .\nRight now , the contest in Iowa could be characterized as a two-person race . The next-closest challenger , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , trails Sanders by 16 percentage points .\nSupport has ticked up slightly for Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris is in fourth place . Warren is now at 9 percent , up from 8 percent , and Harris is at 7 percent , up from 5 percent .\nNext is former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke , who has seen his support fall by about half since December as he continues weighing a possible run . Five percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers now say he is their first choice for president \u2013 down from 11 percent in December .\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar tie with 3 percent . No other candidate gets more than 1 percent , and some \u2013 including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Congressman Eric Swalwell \u2013 were not named as a first choice by a single poll respondent .\nThe Biden-Sanders rivalry embodies a key debate happening within the Democratic Party : Should Democrats nominate a bold progressive who pushes the debate further left , or should they elevate a more moderate centrist who could potentially appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans ?\nSanders , an independent senator who identifies as a Democratic socialist , is the furthest left of all the potential candidates . Forty-four percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers say he \u2019 s \u201c too liberal \u201d \u2013 more than for any other candidate tested . Forty-eight percent say his political views are \u201c just right , \u201d 2 percent say he \u2019 s \u201c too conservative \u201d and 7 percent are unsure .\nAccording to the poll , he appeals most to those who do not identify with any particular religion ( 37 percent ) and those younger than age 35 ( 34 percent ) .\nDec. 16 : Iowa Poll : Trump has big fan base among Iowa Republicans , but they welcome challengers\nBut , generally , likely Democratic caucusgoers say they are OK with candidates who think the country should be more socialist .\nFifteen percent would be \u201c very satisfied \u201d with such a candidate and 41 percent would be \u201c mostly satisfied. \u201d Thirty-three percent would be dissatisfied , and 11 percent are not sure .\nThat \u2019 s roughly comparable to a 2016 Iowa Poll in which 43 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they identify as \u201c socialist. \u201d That was more than the 38 percent who identified as \u201c capitalist . \u201d\nAnd though Sanders \u2019 overall support has ticked up , his favorability ratings fell slightly since December . Seventy-one percent view him favorably now \u2013 down 3 points since December , and 25 percent view him unfavorably \u2013 up 3 points since December .\nBiden , who is expected to campaign as a left-of-center candidate and lean on his decades in politics , does well with self-described moderates ( 35 percent ) . A Catholic , he also does well with the poll \u2019 s small constituency of Catholics ( 44 percent ) .\nEven though Biden and Sanders represent opposite ends of the Democratic ideological spectrum , much of their support overlaps .\nIf Biden decided not to run , 30 percent of those who name him as their first-choice candidate would switch their allegiance to Sanders , whom they named as their second choice . Among those who say Sanders is their first choice , 40 percent say Biden is their second choice .\nSecond choices are important in the Iowa Democrats \u2019 caucus night process . If a caucusgoer \u2019 s first choice fails to advance , the attendee has an opportunity to recast support for a different candidate .\n\u201c The only reason ( Biden ) is my first choice is because I couldn \u2019 t pick two , \u201d said poll respondent Madison Jones , an 18-year-old Waukee resident who likes both Biden and Sanders . \u201c Honestly , they \u2019 re both really great candidates . I \u2019 m drawn to them because , even though they \u2019 re older , they have a better grasp of what the future is going to look like , and they \u2019 re obviously collaborative and open to change . \u201d\nDec. 15 : Iowa Poll : Biden , Sanders top early look at possible Democratic hopefuls in 2020 caucuses\nBut both Biden , 76 , and Sanders , 77 , face criticism that their time has passed , with some arguing they should step aside to make room for a new generation of leaders .\nA majority \u2013 54 percent \u2013 agree that Sanders \u2019 2016 candidacy \u201c has pushed the party in a good direction , and he should be in the race again. \u201d But 43 percent say the time for Sanders as a candidate has passed and he should not be in the race .\nMore are open to a Biden run . Nearly two-thirds say he should get in the race , and 31 percent say his time has passed .\n\u201c As an old white man who \u2019 s been active on the fringes of politics , I think it \u2019 s time to give a shot to younger people , because they \u2019 re going to be inheriting the Earth that we \u2019 re kind of messing with right now , \u201d said poll respondent Gordon Dunn , a 70-year-old Altoona resident who thinks the time for both Sanders and Biden has passed .\nDunn said he \u2019 s interested to hear more from other candidates , particularly some of the women in the race , such as Warren , Klobuchar and Harris .\nHarris is among those who have seen their favorability ratings rise since declaring a presidential run and visiting Iowa as a candidate .\nIn December , 49 percent viewed her favorably . That \u2019 s now up to 58 percent \u2013 the biggest boost in favorability ratings of any candidate . Those who view her unfavorably is virtually unchanged . In December , 41 percent were unsure how they felt about her \u2013 a number that has fallen to 33 percent .\nKlobuchar has seen an increase in both her favorable and unfavorable numbers .\nIn December , 38 percent viewed her favorably , and that 's risen to 43 percent today . But the percentage of those who view her unfavorably also has risen , from 8 percent to 15 percent , the biggest climb in unfavorable numbers for any candidate . She 's been the subject of recent news reports that she \u2019 s verbally abusive toward her staff members .\nHealth care , climate change top of mind for Iowa Democratic caucusgoers\nThe poll also asked Iowans what they want candidates to discuss during the campaign and tested their support for various issues . Health care and climate change top the list of what they want to hear about . Just 22 percent think candidates should talk `` a lot '' about impeachment .\nEighty-one percent say they hope candidates will spend \u201c a lot \u201d of time talking about health care , and 84 percent say they prefer a candidate who supports shifting to a government-run health care system of Medicare-for-all , either all at once or incrementally . Forty-nine percent of respondents say they prefer a candidate who supports Medicare-for-all \u201c in full , \u201d and 35 percent who endorses it \u201c in steps . \u201d\nSherry Murphy , a Sioux City resident in her late 50s and a poll respondent , said she supports moving toward a government-run health-care system incrementally . She said it \u2019 s especially important for \u201c people that are in the middle that are not poor enough to get free government care , like my daughter and her husband . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 ve got two kids , and they make pretty good money , \u201d Murphy said . \u201c But still , they \u2019 re struggling to pay for health care . The middle class is just about gone . It \u2019 s ridiculous . \u201d\nEighty percent of poll respondents say candidates should spend \u201c a lot \u201d of time talking about climate change . Ninety-one percent say they prefer a candidate who supports the `` Green New Deal , '' which couples government programs to address climate change with support for jobs in the clean energy sector to help address poverty . That includes 65 percent who favor a candidate who supports the `` Green New Deal '' in full and 26 percent who favor approaching it in steps .\nEighty-nine percent of respondents support new taxes that target people with more than $ 50 million in assets , something Warren specifically has proposed .
