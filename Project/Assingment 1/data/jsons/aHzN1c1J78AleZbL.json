''\nAfter the ruling , the ACLU said it would appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .\n`` We are extremely disappointed with this decision , which misinterprets the relevant statutes , understates the privacy implications of the government 's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections , '' Jameel Jaffer , ACLU deputy legal director , said in a statement .\nThe Justice Department issued a brief statement : `` We are pleased the court found the NSA 's bulk telephony metadata collection program to be lawful .
