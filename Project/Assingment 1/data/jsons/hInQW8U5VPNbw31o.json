They \u2019 ve finally nailed the blueprint for defeating Republicans in Trump Country .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re going to take the majority , it \u2019 s going to be because we win districts like that , \u201d Texas Democrat Rep. Filemon Vela said in a Beltway news story that claims incoming Democratic Rep. Conor \u201c Lamb \u2019 s success could provide a blueprint for other Democrats in tough races . \u201d\nThe Democrats , to be sure , will win seats in the midterm elections , and might even take the House , but not the way they took Pennsylvania 18 .\nThe \u201c blueprint \u201d goes something like this : Run a young , handsome Marine , make sure he \u2019 s pro-Second Amendment , make sure he \u2019 s anti-Nancy Pelosi , make sure he \u2019 s quiet on plans for amnesty , make sure he says he \u2019 s personally against abortion but runs like hell from any specific questions , and make sure he \u2019 s quiet about Democrats \u2019 anti-energy agenda .\nSound unlikely in today \u2019 s Democratic Party ? It \u2019 s preposterous . That might not seem apparent to giddy D.C. election consultants , so of course it didn \u2019 t dawn on the gossip-mongers of Washington \u2019 s press corps , but three things \u2013Democratic leadership , the party \u2019 s faithful , and the man in the White House \u2014 conspire to ensure this blueprint never happens on any kind of national scale .\nFor sixteen long years , Nancy Pelosi has led the Democratic Party . Her first partner was Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle , who voted to ban partial-birth abortion in 2003 , but lost his seat ( and his post in Senate leadership ) to Republican Sen. John Thune a year later . After Daschle , Pelosi led alongside Sen. Harry Reid , who entered the post with a 20 percent rating from abortion cheerleaders NARAL and a 69 percent from the NRA , but ended his career with a 100 from NARAL and a perfect score for expanding background checks from the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence .\nToday , the two leaders of the Democratic Party , Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi , are far more pure than the slow , politically motivated converts who came before . Since advocacy groups began their rating systems , the two have hovered between a 0-percent and 7-percent rating from the NRA , and neither has dropped from below a 100-percent record with the abortion lobby .\nAnd the party machine has taken the cue . In 2016 , the official party platform called \u201c unequivocally \u201d for \u201c legal abortion . \u201d\n\u201c Every candidate who runs as a Democrat should do the same , \u201d Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Perez decreed the following year .\nThe year after that , the DCCC , the party \u2019 s congressional campaign coordinator , broke with precedent and declined to endorse one of its own , seven-term Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski , against a challenger from the left . Lipinski \u2019 s sin is he is anti-abortion and a member of the all-but-extinct moderate \u201c Blue Dog Coalition , \u201d while his challenger is an abortion enthusiast endorsed by a whole host of fellow travelers , including sitting Democrats in the House and Senate . But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn \u2019 t an outside , progressive organization or a single politician , it \u2019 s \u201c the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the House of Representatives \u201d and \u201c the only political committee in the country whose principal mission is to support Democratic House candidates every step of the way to victory . \u201d\nUnless , it appears , that Democratic House candidate strays from the one true faith .\nBut then Pennsylvania \u2019 s Conor Lamb prepared to win a House seat in a Trump +20 district supporting late-term abortion but publicly saying he thought it was bad . As his win approached , the DCCC changed it \u2019 s tune , and a week before the Pennsylvania special election they decided to remember Lipinski and support their embattled colleague .\n\u201c CONGRATULATIONS are in order for @ ConorLambPA and Pennsylvania Democrats \u2014 they just made history and FLIPPED # PA18 , a district Trump won by 20 points ! ! ! \u201d the DCCC tweeted upon victory . \u201c RT if you \u2019 re ready to repeat this victory , district by district , all across the country ! \u201d\nBut no amount of retweets can change the trajectory of the Democratic Party this year . Why ?\nSchumer and Pelosi may be in charge , but like nearly all politicians , they don \u2019 t truly lead : They follow the loudest \u201c progressive \u201d voices , and in the months before the DCCC \u2019 s initial decision to excommunicate , the hard-left column belching loudest was clear in its demands .\n\u201c Of Course Abortion Should Be a Litmus Test for Democrats , \u201d Lindy West titled an op-ed in The New York Times . \u201c This issue represents everything Democrats purport to stand for . \u201d\n\u201c If the Democratic Party cares about economic issues , it must make reproductive choice fundamental to its platform , \u201d the assistant editor for opinion news at U.S. News & World Report declared . \u201c Progressives wouldn \u2019 t stomach a Democratic candidate who questioned the necessity of Brown v. Board of Education , \u201d she continued , equating Christians and Hindus with segregationists , \u201c so why might we make an exception when it comes to women \u2019 s economic well-being ? \u201d\n\u201c Ignoring women \u2019 s fundamental freedoms and equality to win elections is both an ethically and politically bankrupt strategy , \u201d apparent moralist and NARAL President Ilyse Hogue tweeted .\n\u201c It \u2019 s short-sighted and dangerous to pave the path to victory in 2018 at the expense of women , \u201d Destiny Lopez , co-director of abortion-promoters All * Above All , chimed in .\n\u201c If your answer is no [ on abortion ] , the Democratic Party shouldn \u2019 t fund your campaign. \u201d a CNN op-ed from an attorney \u201c based in Nairobi and New York City \u201d read .\n\u201c The core concern is that the party would errantly move away from a commitment to women \u2019 s human rights as it tries to rebuild , \u201d Erin Matson , a former vice president of the National Organization for Women , told The Atlantic .\nTo say otherwise , a writer for Teen Vogue tweeted , \u201c is a betrayal of every woman who has ever supported the Democratic party .\n\u201c If that \u2019 s a purity test , \u201d a goth writer at The Guardian preached , \u201c call me Mother Theresa . \u201d\nAbortion is far from the only demand on the base \u2019 s menu . Right above its demands on abortion , the Womens \u2019 March \u2019 s website has a list of \u201c LGBTQIA RIGHTS \u201d non-negotiables . In 2016 , Sen. Bernie Sanders nearly won the nomination as an open socialist . Democratic leaders like Sen. Liz Warren loudly call for gun-control while CNN cheers on . Pelosi stood for eight hours to protest not for VA reform , not for the opioid epidemic , but for illegal immigrants . Coal , oil , fracking and most other types of energy and industry are out . Pipelines ? Who needs \u2019 em . \u201c All Lives Matter \u201d is racist , men are oppressors , Republicans are Nazis , and masked vigilantes from Boston to Berkeley burn buildings and attack Trump supporters with bats and chains while the Democratic Party can barely muster a mumble in protest .\nPresident Trump has driven his opponents mad . In the coastal states and in major cities , old friends , neighbors and businesses post signs about \u201c love \u201d and \u201c respect \u201d that offer the dual function of signaling virtue while telling Trump supporters they aren \u2019 t welcome . Middle-class mothers and daughters who months before had booked non-refundable hotels and airlines to see Hillary Clinton \u2019 s inauguration parade instead find themselves donning \u201c pussy hats \u201d and beating drums in the street . College professors are drawing up lists of unapproved media like 15th century inquisitors .
