Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible , at least very tough to get into the United States ? If you were a Muslim you could come in , but if you were a Christian , it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair , everybody was persecuted in all fairness , but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians . And I thought it was very , very unfair . ''\nBut some Christian leaders are pushing back on Trump 's promise to help persecuted Christians .\nIn a letter obtained by Politico , a broad coalition of Christian leaders and evangelical groups , criticized Trump for only focusing on Christians .\n`` The Bible teaches us that each person-including each refugee , regardless of their country of origin , religious background , or any other qualifier-is made in the Image of God , with inherent dignity and potential . Their lives matter to God , and they matter to us , '' the letter said .\nChristians are The Most Persecuted Religious Minority in the Middle East\nStill , Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world yet the number of those allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. are dramatically lower than Muslims who were permitted into the country .\n`` What we 're going to do is make sure that people who have been persecuted for either religious or other reasons have an opportunity to apply and go through a vetting system that ensures they 're coming to this country to seek asylum , to seek a new life for themselves or their family , but to do so with peaceful purposes , '' Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary , told ABC News .\nWhen pressed further to answer `` Why are Christian refugees more worthy of admission to the United States than Muslims or even Jewish refugees ? '' Spicer told ABC News : `` Well , it 's a question of making sure that in many of these countries they are the persecuted group . And so it 's just - it 's a fact that when they live in a majority country of another religion , they are a minority being persecuted , not able to practice their religion , in some cases under threat , '' Spicer said . `` And so it 's just a fact that they are being persecuted in some of these countries and we need to make sure we recognize them so that they can come to this country and be able to practice their religion in accordance with our laws and our constitution . ''\nFor example in Syria alone , where more than one million Christians there have fled the five-year civil war , 98 percent of those allowed into the United States last year were Sunni Muslims .\nAccording to the State Department , of the 15,152 Syrians who were resettled in the U.S. in 2016 , only 89 were Christians or one half of one percent .",
