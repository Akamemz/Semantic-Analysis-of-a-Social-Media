    "content": "The 112th Congress , born in the tea party wave of 2010 and ending with President Obama 's thundering reelection last November , was the least productive session in more than 60 years . Quietly , however , the 113th Congress is showing signs of getting more things done over the next two years \u2013 despite all the rancor beneath the rotunda .\nThe year started off with a bipartisan group of senior senators heading off a potentially `` nuclear '' showdown over a controversial Senate tool \u2013 the filibuster . In March , the long-delayed Violence Against Women Act moved from moribund to becoming law . More recently House and Senate lawmakers worked assiduously to keep the government funded through the end of the fiscal year , without the protests that have surrounded such measures in the recent past .\nOn nearly every major legislative initiative , at least some bipartisan activity is under way , even if it is n't yielding everything its sponsors would like . From strengthening controls on firearms to immigration reform to renewed stirrings of a `` grand bargain '' on taxes and entitlement programs , Congress is alive with the possibility of compromise . In other words , the dealmakers are resurfacing .\nMany of the obstacles to congressional deal-making have been building for years and are n't peculiar to Washington 's current dysfunction . The sharp divide among lawmakers reflects in part the polarization on a wide range of policy and cultural issues that exists among the voters who sent them there .\nThe positions are hardened by deep-pocketed advocacy groups with ideological focuses as intense as they are narrow . Such groups make departing from the party line more dangerous than ever . The increasing amount of money needed to run for Congress also means lawmakers spend more time fundraising and less time studying issues or forging relationships with colleagues , the chassis on which dealmaking is built .\nComplicating the impulse to compromise today is the frequency with which Capitol Hill is experiencing `` wave '' elections . Several electoral drubbings \u2013 Democratic triumphs in 2006 and 2008 , the Republican resurgence in 2010 \u2013 have fed a sense among new members that any concessions on the issues that brought them to power would betray their constituents . While these transformative elections usually happen about once every decade , the recent cluster has created cliques of lawmakers with seemingly narrow mandates to an extent rarely seen in US history .\nMembers elected in such waves `` are really not going to make deals that go against what the people who put them there want [ them ] to do , '' says former Rep. Steven LaTourette ( R ) of Ohio , a centrist . `` On 'Obamacare , ' you do n't hear a lot of the 2010 class say , 'Well , let 's save the good parts and jettison the rest .
