    "content": "FINAL UPDATE - The votes are in , and the ayes have it . After a marathon evening of debating and considering amendments , the US Senate has approved the GOP 's tax reform bill , which would simplify the tax code and cut taxes for the vast majority of American households , small businesses and corporations . Every Republican voted yes , except for Tennessee 's Bob Corker . Democrats uniformly voted no . This is a big legislative victory for the GOP , which overcame a great deal of ferocious opposition -- much of it rooted in misinformation -- to pass the legislation . Up next , a conference committee with the House . But here 's your summary for tonight :\nFINAL : With Vice President Pence presiding , the US Senate approves a major tax cut & simplification package , 51-49 . The bill will now head to a conference committee , where it will be merged with the House-passed bill . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) December 2 , 2017\nUPDATE III - It 's now looking official : Senate Republicans have the votes to pass tax reform . Arizona 's Jeff Flake announced he 's jumping on the bandwagon , and the finalized legislation includes a ( paid for ) amendment sought by Maine 's Susan Collins that mirrors the House-passed SALT ( state and local tax deduction ) compromise . That strongly suggests that she 'll be a `` yes , '' too . Add it up , and that 's 51 , negating the need for Vice President Pence to break a potential tie . Depending on Bob Corker 's mood in a few hours , McConnell might even get all 52 GOP votes . But all he really needs is 50-plus-one , and he says he 's got 'em :\nBREAKING : McConnell walks onto the floor and tells reporters : \u201c We have the votes. \u201d \u2014 Frank Thorp V ( @ frankthorp ) December 1 , 2017\nORIGINAL POST - The Republican-held House of Representatives did its part by passing a tax overhaul earlier this month , with zero Democrats supporting the effort . That bill cut taxes and boosted after-tax incomes , on average , across every income group in the country , and is projected by nonpartisan analysts to grow the US economy and create close to one million new full-time jobs . It would also lower the tax burden on job-creating small businesses ( key small business advocacy groups have endorsed the Republican push ) , and make America 's extremely high statutory and effective corporate tax rates far more competitive internationally . But we 've seen this movie before . With the `` resistance '' in full demagogic throat , and Democrats bound in lockstep opposition , will the GOP 's narrow Senate majority fumble the ball , as they did on Obamacare ? We 'll know soon enough , and tea leaves are mixed . A vote is expected later today . As we brace what 's next , let 's first note three developments from yesterday ( see update ) that may portend a successful outcome ( see update II ) for Mitch McConnell 's conference :\n( 1 ) John McCain is a committed `` yes . '' As the Senator who more or less single-handedly killed his party 's `` repeal and replace '' efforts in July , having him clearly on board is a huge boon to Republican leadership . McCain 's official statement touted the expected benefits of the bill -- acknowledging concerns about it , but ultimately determining that the legislation 's upside was strong enough to secure his support :\nAfter careful consideration , I have decided to support the Senate # TaxReform bill . Though not perfect , this bill will deliver much-needed reform to our tax code , grow the economy & provide long overdue tax relief for American families . https : //t.co/BeWZAT0SjM pic.twitter.com/6qwYhmyE5p \u2014 John McCain ( @ SenJohnMcCain ) November 30 , 2017\nHe even specifically addressed and endorsed the proposal 's provision that would repeal Obamacare 's tent pole , the federal individual mandate tax : `` I have also argued that health care reform , which is important both to the well-being of our citizens and to the vitality of our economy , should proceed by regular order . This bill does not change that . As a matter of principle , I \u2019 ve always supported individual liberty and believe the federal government should not penalize Americans who can not afford to purchase expensive health insurance . By repealing the individual mandate , this bill would eliminate an onerous tax that especially harms those from low-income brackets . In my home state of Arizona , 80 percent of people who currently pay the individual mandate penalty earn less than $ 50,000 per year , '' he wrote .\n( 2 ) The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation released its `` dynamic scoring '' analysis that the Senate bill would add less than $ 1 trillion to deficits over a decade , as opposed to the on-paper $ 1.4 trillion figure reached under `` static scoring . '' The reason for this is that JCT anticipates the tax relief package would add nearly one percentage point to GDP growth over the next ten years , resulting in new revenues . Many supporters will argue that JCT underestimates the economic benefits of tax reform , but their report still offers two positive data points :\nJt Tax Cmte forecasts tax bill will increase GDP `` by about 0.8 percent on average over the 10- year budget window . That increase in income would increase revenues , relative to the conventional estimate of a loss of $ 1,414 billion .. by $ 458 billion over that period . '' \u2014 Chad Pergram ( @ ChadPergram ) November 30 , 2017\nJust spoke w/ Senate leadership source who I 'd characterize as hopeful but never quite confident on the `` repeal & replace '' whip count over the summer . Sounds * much * more confident on tax reform today , despite some issues still being ironed out . # fwiw \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) November 30 , 2017\nThat was the state of play late yesterday afternoon , with my well-placed source telling me McConnell and company were in a `` really good place '' in terms of corralling the requisite 50-plus-one votes . The source stopped short of guaranteeing passage at the time , but described potential holdouts as playing an active and `` constructive '' role in shaping the bill throughout the process , carried out through regular order . Susan Collins is said to be in a decent spot , and McConnell 's `` substitute amendment '' ( effectively the bill that was formally debated on the floor ) was co-sponsored by ... Lisa Murkowski . The three squeakiest wheels , I was told , were outgoing Tennessee Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake ( who want a deficit-related `` backstop '' to reduce the tax cuts if economic growth falls short of targets ) , and Wisconsin 's Ron Johnson . Johnson been characterized as a `` hard no '' in the media , but he 's a pro-business , low-tax conservative at heart . I 'm not so sure he 's still in the 'nay ' column , considering his evolving posture ( this was from Wednesday evening -- and see update below ) :\nWe still have work to do , but I have been working with the administration and Senate leadership to make progress toward a better bill . - rj # taxreform \u2014 Senator Ron Johnson ( @ SenRonJohnson ) November 29 , 2017\nThe bigger challenges appear to stem from the other two Senators , who emerged at the center of some floor drama last evening , which bubbled to the surface in full view of reporters . ( My source quoted above still sounds optimistic , but last evening was a setback ) . Relevant parties spent the overnight hours seeking to hammer out an accommodation to address Corker and Flake 's deficit concerns after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a proposed `` trigger '' mechanism compromise did not pass procedural muster under reconciliation rules . Might that eleventh-hour wrinkle cause the upper chamber GOP to once again face-plant ? Stay tuned for the yeas and nays , which may again blow up in embarrassing fashion -- or could result in a big policy and political win for Republicans . In the meantime , the Left is shouting as loudly as possible to kill the bill . Some of their biggest claims are false . Equip yourself with the facts , and help educate others . The empirically-supportable truth is that the vast majority of taxpayers stand to benefit from tax reform . Nevertheless , every single Senate Democrat marched along to Chuck Schumer 's beat and voted against even debating the proposal , some of whom defended their decision with nonsensical explanations like this :\nI voted against the motion to proceed on the Republican # taxreform plan because I haven \u2019 t seen a final bill .
