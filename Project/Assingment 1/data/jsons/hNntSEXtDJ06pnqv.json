They are hysterically anti-Trump , in fact , to the point that they have harmed their own credibility . They can not hope to win seats simply by shouting \u201c Impeachment ! \u201d and then waiting for political manna to fall from heaven . They must make proposals . They must offer a firm , ideologically grounded opposition .\nAccording to this narrative , Republicans have the upper hand in 2020 . All they have to do is let President Trump drive the Left batty , pass a few pieces of relatively minor legislation , and watch Democrats implode . Democrats won \u2019 t be able to win just by trotting out Maxine Waters and Al Franken . They \u2019 ll have to do something to put the pieces back together .\nThere \u2019 s only one problem with this narrative : It isn \u2019 t true .\nSince 2006 , opposition to the president in power has been a gold mine for the party out of power .

In September 2005 , the Democrats \u2019 incessant opposition to President Bush drew dividends : When Hurricane Katrina hit , the party pounced on Bush \u2019 s supposed malfeasance .
