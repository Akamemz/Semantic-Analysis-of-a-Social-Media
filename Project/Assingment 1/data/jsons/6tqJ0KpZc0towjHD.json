''\nAnd for Jamieson , this debate only served to exacerbate those frustrations . `` When you open a debate by asking about candidate weaknesses ( moderators opened this debate by asking each candidate what their greatest weakness was ) , in a debate in which the the candidates really are not well known yet , first you 're asking a question no competent candidate is actually going to honestly answer , '' she says . `` So , it 's largely a waste of time , to find out how they 're going to dodge the question . ''\nFor Jamieson , part of why `` The Media '' is held in such low regard , compared to times past , is because the media , right now , is very different than what it was a few decades ago .\n`` We have a changed media culture , '' Jamieson says . `` When people talk about trust in media across time , they 're actually measuring something that 's very different . If you look at the 1960s and 1970s for example , you had three possibly four [ if you count PBS ] , major media outlets for broadcast news .\n`` Now we 've seen ... the rise in online content , and the proliferation of media channels , with the advent both of cable , and then of many forms of online dissemination .

And when what you 're critiquing is actually up for debate as well , it allows everyone to critique whatever they want .\n`` When you ask about the media , often I think what you 're actually hearing people say \u2014 particularly people who find most of their news in ideologically compatible outlets \u2014 I think what they 're actually saying is , 'what I mean is , the media I do n't pay attention to , ' '' Jamieson said .\nOnline , this critique of the media , led to a backlash , from the media itself .
