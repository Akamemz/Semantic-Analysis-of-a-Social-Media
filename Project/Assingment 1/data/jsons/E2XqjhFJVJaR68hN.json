    "content": "Not wearing a health mask goes against common sense and historical data .\nIrrational : lacking usual or normal mental clarity or coherence , not endowed with reason or understanding , not governed by or according to reason .

As a physician and science-based professional , I , like many of my colleagues , adjust our advice to patients based on the latest data .\nIf something changes , we change our approach in order best to ensure the safety and health of our patients . For example , when the warnings about contacting the virus due to touching of hard surfaces were relaxed , we adjusted based on new information . This will continue to occur as we learn more about this new virus and its behavior .\nSome things , however , have not changed . For example , we know that the best way to avoid contracting the virus , as well as speeding the spread , is to adhere to social distancing , avoid touching one \u2019 s face , along with frequent washing of hands . These are accepted and the most effective ways of slowing the progression of the disease .\nMasks are not an end-all solution . They are an aid to support the methods of safety . A cover keeps one from directly touching our own face . It also helps to stop droplets that may contain the virus from exiting your mouth and potentially spreading to others . It does not prevent one from inhaling the virus . Only a full-blown , filtered respirator can do that .\nSo , if it can not prevent you from catching the virus , why wear one at all ? Basically , to help protect others and help slow the spread of the disease . It is that simple . We know that people who never develop symptoms , but do indeed have the virus ( asymptomatic carriers ) , may quickly spread the virus .\nEven those who will eventually develop symptoms are themselves asymptomatic for a few days before becoming ill . Therefore , they can also unknowingly spread the virus to others .\nIf we all return to basics of appropriate social distance , hand washing , sneezing into our arm , not touching our face , and yes , wearing a mask , we can help slow down the spread of this potentially deadly virus . These are the most effective risk-reducing techniques if used together and consistently by all of us .\nThere is no way to eliminate the risk of infection all together . This is the argument against wearing a mask . This fact challenged the notion of doing so and began the \u201c no mask \u201d argument .\nAdditionally , now that the wearing of a mask has been manipulated into a badge of either honor or one of defeat by disparate groups , it has made matters worse .

Why?\n\nHow Health Masks Work\n\nHow to wear a COVID-19 mask\n\nMasks are not an end-all solution. They are an aid to support the methods of safety. A cover keeps one from directly touching our own face. It also helps to stop droplets that may contain the virus from exiting your mouth and potentially spreading to others. It does not prevent one from inhaling the virus. Only a full-blown, filtered respirator can do that.\n\nSo, if it cannot prevent you from catching the virus, why wear one at all?

These are the most effective risk-reducing techniques if used together and consistently by all of us.\n\nThe Politics Of Health Masks\n\nThere is no way to eliminate the risk of infection all together. This is the argument against wearing a mask. This fact challenged the notion of doing so and began the \u201cno mask\u201d argument.\n\nProtesters against wearing health masks\n\nAdditionally, now that the wearing of a mask has been manipulated into a badge of either honor or one of defeat by disparate groups, it has made matters worse.
