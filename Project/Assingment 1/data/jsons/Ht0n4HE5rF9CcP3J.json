According to a report in the New York Times , Malik spoke openly on social media about her support for violent jihad and said she wanted to be a part of it . But none of these postings were discovered when Malik applied for a U.S. K-1 fianc\u00e9 visa .\n`` If you 're going to start doing a deeper dive into somebody and looking at their social media postings or other things , you really want to focus your effort on the high-risk traveler , the person that you 're really worried about being a threat to the United States , '' said James Carafano , national security expert and vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation . `` The question is , how do you identify them ? ''\nMalik was not identified as a threat despite being interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and vetted by five different government agencies that checked her name and picture against a terror watch list and ran her fingerprints against two databases .\n`` This is a case where , in retrospect , we know that this is a person that had lots of red lights and red flags . How come they did n't stand out as a high risk traveler ? That 's a really , really good question , '' Carafano said .\nOver the weekend , dive teams from the FBI and local police finished searching the bottom of a muddy lake three miles from the site where the couple opened fire and killed 14 people . They pulled multiple objects from the water , but it is unknown if they recovered a computer hard drive that Farook and Malik may have discarded in the lake before they were killed in a shootout with police .\nInvestigators hope to search that hard drive for information on potential connections between the couple and foreign terror groups .\nThey also continue to question Enrique Marquez , Farook 's friend who we know purchased the two semi-automatic rifles that were used in the attack . It is likely that Marquez will be charged with something once authorities finish speaking with him , but so far sources tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 he has waived his rights and is being very cooperative .",
