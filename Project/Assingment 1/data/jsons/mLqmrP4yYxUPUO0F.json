The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing . I have nothing to say , except I \u2019 m really proud of the work they \u2019 ve done . \u201d\nDonald Trump says 'close the Clinton Foundation ' , but its work is crucial | Janet Ritz Read more\nBut the issue of a potential conflict of interest between the Clinton Foundation and state department , where Hillary was secretary from 2009 to 2013 , has dogged her election campaign this week , finally taking some heat off rival Donald Trump .\nInterpretations range from corruption \u201c bigger than Watergate \u201d , as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani put it , to manufactured scandal . Late night TV host Stephen Colbert summed up the ambivalence : \u201c The Clinton Foundation scandal lands right up there as \u2018 maybe a thing \u2019 , which is the same ranking as bald guys with pony tails , because it may not be a crime but it sure don \u2019 t look good . \u201d\nSmoke without fire ? Suddenly the Clinton Foundation finds itself on trial .\nIt was essentially Bill Clinton \u2019 s answer to the perennially tricky question of what ex-presidents should do next . He is not the first to create a foundation \u2013 and the Obama Foundation is already at work \u2013 but he is the first to have a spouse run for the White House . Hence the uniquely awkward situation .\nBill Clinton launched the public charity after leaving the White House in 2001 . It sought to bring together governments , businesses and social groups to tackle the world \u2019 s most pressing problems : health , climate change , economic development and opportunities for girls and women .\nThe Washington Post wrote last year : \u201c The Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible \u2013 the Clintons \u2019 global goodwill \u2013 into something tangible : money . For the Clintons \u2019 charitable causes . For their aides and allies . And , indirectly , for the Clintons themselves . \u201d\nMore than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $ 2bn in funding since its creation , the Associated Press reported . It has a staff of nearly 500 people .\nThe foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president . Addressing staff recently , Bill Clinton commented : \u201c I \u2019 ve done a lot of interesting things in my life , and I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever done anything that I \u2019 ve loved this much as this foundation. \u201d He admitted the prospect of scaling it down \u201c is like a root canal for me \u201d .\nLarry Noble , general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center , says : \u201c The foundation does real work . It \u2019 s not a sham organisation . \u201d\nIt claims to have \u201c dramatically improved \u201d the lives of millions of people around the world . Clinton \u2019 s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students .\nLaura Seay , an academic who witnessed the foundation \u2019 s work firsthand in east Africa , said : \u201c The perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does . The Clintons don \u2019 t take a salary from it . \u201d\nSeay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , where militias roamed and few aid organisations ventured . She recalled how , with Clinton Foundation funding , the Heal Africa hospital in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children , most of whom survived . \u201c I know teens & young adults who were kids then & are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would , \u201d she tweeted .\nSeay , assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville , Maine , adds in an interview : \u201c The Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this . What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones . It really was remarkable . \u201d\nClinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs , Seay argues .\nThe foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism . According to the New York Times , in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton \u2019 s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there . A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills , who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department .\nThe foundation \u2019 s banner event , the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting , is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including , in 2007 , $ 2m to help build the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village for orphans of the genocide and Aids .\nSpeaking by phone from Rwanda , its director , Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura , says of the foundation : \u201c It seems to be doing some very good work in the country . Its work in health could be extremely beneficial . \u201d\nSupport from the foundation is also a superb calling card for non-government organisations seeking other partners , he adds . \u201c Having the Clinton Foundation name in the list of donors may encourage other funders to provide support . \u201d\nThe foundation agreed to voluntarily disclose the names and donations of its contributors after Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state in late 2008 , despite not being legally obliged to do so . It holds an A rating from CharityWatch , having spent 88 % of its budget on programmes rather than overheads .\nIts list of donors includes Trump , who gave between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000 in 2009 and has attended a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative . One Clinton ally , noting Trump \u2019 s demands for a special prosecutor to look into the foundation , says : \u201c As a donor , Trump is calling for an investigation of himself . \u201d\nHowever , the Politifact website contends that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions , including not reporting a $ 500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010 .\nPay for play . Donors to the foundation are said to have jumped the queue and gained special access to the state department . The AP wrote this week : \u201c More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money \u2013 either personally or through companies or groups \u2013 to the Clinton Foundation . It \u2019 s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president . \u201d\nThe AP found that at least 85 of 154 people with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $ 156m to her family \u2019 s charities . Trump , struggling in the polls , sensed an opening and piled on . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins , \u201d he told a rally on Wednesday night .\nGiuliani fumed : \u201c It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office . They sold access and specific actions for money . This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate . In other words , they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise . \u201d\nBut Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule . She told CNN on Wednesday : \u201c I know there \u2019 s a lot of smoke and there \u2019 s no fire . This AP report ? Put it in context , excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders , plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state . It looked at a small portion of my time .\n\u201c It drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late , great , Elie Wiesel , or Melinda Gates , or the Nobel prize winner , Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders . That is absurd . These are people I was proud to meet with , who any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with and hear about their work and their insight . \u201d\nHowever , there has also been a steady trickle of emails into the public domain that reveal how donors sought meetings with Clinton by trying to call in favours from the foundation . Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain did get an appointment but others did not , and the Clinton camp insists the meetings were arranged through official channels .\nHillary Clinton \u2019 s close aide Huma Abedin , who features prominently in the emails , appears to embody the tension , having worked at the state department while also being contracted to the Clinton Foundation .\nAccess is one thing , but is there a smoking gun that proves foreign donors influenced Clinton \u2019 s decision-making as secretary of state ?\nNo . Evidence of a causal link has not come to light , at least not yet . Elizabeth Trudeau , a spokesperson for the state department , says : \u201c The state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation. \u201d There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal .\nBut Peter Schweizer , author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News , said : \u201c It \u2019 s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don \u2019 t expect something in return . They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department . There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation . We can \u2019 t allow politicians to police themselves on these matters . \u201d\nClinton Foundation : Bill to quit board if Hillary becomes president Read more\nThe foundation was a useful \u201c conduit \u201d for the Clintons to avoid the normal rules governing contributions to politicians , Schweizer adds . \u201c You look at Huma Abedin who was on the payroll of both the Clinton Foundation and state department . I don \u2019 t think \u2018 inevitable overlap \u2019 involves dual payrolls . \u201d\nNot good , especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes . It gives the appearance , at least , of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department .\n\u201c The frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations , and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton , \u201d the AP report said .\nScott Amey , general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight , said : \u201c I think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest .\n\u201c The question is , in giving money to the Clinton Foundation , did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department ? We don \u2019 t know . Only time will tell . It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access . \u201d\nPerhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable . But Amey adds : \u201c One of the biggest mistakes here is they didn \u2019 t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines .
