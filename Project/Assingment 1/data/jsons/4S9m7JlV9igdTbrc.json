    "content": "UPDATE : Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said strikes from the U.S. and Arab partners were trying to hit training facilities and headquarter buildings of the Islamic State in Syria where officials believed the terrorist group was trying to command and control their forces .\n\u201c We \u2019 re still assessing the effectiveness of these strikes , but we believe we hit what we were aiming at , \u201d he said on MSNBC .\nPresident Obama on Monday night authorized a major escalation of the war against the Islamic State , sending missiles and warplanes on bombing missions for the first time into Syria to strike the terrorist group \u2019 s strongholds in that country .\nThe Pentagon announced that both U.S. and allied pilots , along with missile-firing U.S. ships , launched their first airstrikes inside Syria after a sweeping diplomatic push by the Obama administration had secured dozens of verbal commitments from leaders around the world and in the Middle East to join the fight against the Islamic State .\nThe missiles and bombs began flying into Islamic State-held areas early Tuesday local time and was expected to last for the next few days , a senior Pentagon official told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSEE ALSO : Fears mount that the Islamic State is plotting terror strike in Jordan\n\u201c We will continue to attack Islamic State targets whether they \u2019 re in Iraq or in Syria , \u201d the official said .\nThe barrage also comes on the eve of President Obama \u2019 s speech to the United Nations General Assembly and two days of meetings with world leaders at the New York gathering .\nPentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby noted Monday night that the U.S. was not acting alone , and there were multiple reports of involvement by several Arab nations in about two dozen strikes , concentrated on the insecure Iraqi-Syrian border and on Raqqa , the Islamic State \u2019 s de facto capital .\nSeveral news organizations specified involvement in airstrikes by Bahrain , Jordan , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , while CNN reported that some Jordanian special operations forces were involved in ground assaults in Syria .\nAll those nations are conservative Sunni monarchies that could see the Islamic State as undermining their legitimacy despite its being a Sunni group fighting one majority-Shiite regime ( Iraq ) and one Alawite-dominated government ( Syria ) .\nBut Adm. Kirby himself said only that \u201c I can confirm that U.S. military and partner nation forces are undertaking military action against [ Islamic State ] terrorists in Syria using a mix of fighter , bomber and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles . Given that these operations are ongoing , we are not in a position to provide additional details at this time . \u201d\nRep. Michael T. McCaul , Texas Republican and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , praised the assault , saying \u201c in times of war and of peace it is important that we come together as a nation .\n\u201c To defeat ISIS , we must cut off the head of the snake , which exists in Syria . I support the administration \u2019 s move to conduct airstrikes against ISIS wherever it exists , \u201d he said .\nEven before the Pentagon announcement Monday evening , though , senior administration officials were unclear on exactly what role each coalition partner will play .\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry dodged that question Monday , and questions remain over whether Turkey \u2014 which has a more than 750-mile border with Syria and Iraq and has resisted joining the coalition \u2014 will join the U.S.-led effort or continue to stay on the sidelines .\nTurkish diplomats have paid lip service to the American push for international action against the Islamic State , also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL . But with Ankara having secured the release of 49 hostages from the Islamic State under vague circumstances in recent days , analysts cite fears that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have cut a secret deal with the extremists that involves staying out of the U.S.-led coalition .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of suspicion in Turkish public opinion right now about how the hostage deal was reached , \u201d said Cenk Sidar , the head of Washington-based Sidar Global Advisors , a private analysis firm . \u201c People believe there is some sort of a deal between Erdogan and ISIL .\n\u201c It seems there may have been a deal to release the hostages , but we don \u2019 t know what assurances have been given to ISIL in return , \u201d Mr. Sidar said in an interview Monday . \u201c Did they agree to something involving the Turkish border ? Did they agree not to join the coalition against [ the Islamic State ] ? \u201d\nMeanwhile , tensions escalated to new heights Monday along Turkey \u2019 s border with Iraq and Syria , where the Islamic State now controls a wide swath of territory .\nTurkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtlumus claimed that some 130,000 Syrian Kurdish refugees \u2014 mostly women , children and elderly \u2014 have crossed into Turkey in the past four days , fleeing an onslaught by Islamic State militants on their villages and towns .\nThe situation has heightened tensions between Turkish authorities and Syrian and Iraqi Kurds . The Obama administration has been leaning heavily on Iraqi Kurds to take a lead role in ground-level combat against the Islamic State .\nThe Erdogan government has cited the surge of refugees as a reason to clamp down on key border crossings with Iraq and Syria . The move prompted clashes Sunday and Monday between Turkish police and angry Kurds stuck along the border . More than 100,000 displaced people from years of war in Syria are already living in camps on the Turkish side of the border .\nMr. Kerry in recent days has publicly questioned whether rogue elements inside Turkey are secretly working with Islamic State militants to transport crude oil northward across the Turkish border from Syria and Iraq for sale on the global black market , helping to finance the Islamist movement \u2019 s operations .\n\u201c There are various channels , \u201d Mr. Kerry said Monday during an interview with MSNBC , adding that a core part of the growing U.S.-led mission is to ensure that oil \u201c can \u2019 t move through Turkey or through Syria or out through Lebanon . \u201d\nTop Obama administration officials have provided few details on intelligence relating to the suspected Islamic State oil smuggling operation , and intelligence community sources in Washington cautioned against reading too deeply into Mr. Kerry \u2019 s remarks .\nOne U.S. intelligence official told The Times that \u201c the black market in Turkey is playing an important role in giving [ the Islamic State ] a profitable outlet for the oil it controls , \u201d but challenged the notion that Turkish authorities might have a role in the smuggling operation .\nFurther , the official said , some Iraqi Kurds may be involved in the smuggling , even as Kurdish forces are involved in fighting Islamic State militants .\n\u201c The area in Iraq where ISIL is operating is associated with long-standing oil smuggling networks which have traditionally had a Kurdish component , \u201d the intelligence official said . \u201c So , nobody should be surprised if there were Kurds involved in bringing ISIL-controlled oil to market . \u201d\nThe official added that there are \u201c constraints on [ the Islamic State \u2019 s ] ability to capitalize on the energy infrastructure it controls as it can \u2019 t sell at market prices , lacks technical expertise , and can not operate facilities \u2014 some of which are shut down entirely \u2014 at anywhere near full capacity . \u201d\nWhile Mr. Kerry has repeatedly referenced the smuggling problem , he also has stressed that Turkey \u2014 long regarded as a key NATO ally and a bridge to the Middle East and Central Asia for the alliance \u2014 remains a close diplomatic friend of Washington .\nMr. Kerry said Monday that he \u201c had a long meeting with President Erdogan \u201d last week . He also told a Capitol Hill hearing last week that the Erdogan government \u2019 s reluctance to supporting the fight against the Islamic State might be related to the dozens of Turkish citizens held hostage in northern Iraq .\nBut with the hostage release , Mr. Kerry implied Monday , the Obama administration intends to mount pressure on Turkey to take a more active stand . \u201c The proof will be in the actions , \u201d he told MSNBC . \u201c We \u2019 re not going to take anything to the bank on the basis of a verbal interaction . \u201d\nMr. Kerry has spent the past three days in New York City meeting face to face with dozens of diplomatic counterparts on the periphery of the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering . He said Friday that \u201c more than 50 countries have come forward with critical commitments \u201d to the growing coalition .\nBut there has been little evidence of tangible action . On Friday , Mr. Kerry said dozens of countries had committed \u201c almost $ 1 billion \u201d to a U.N.-led humanitarian response to the crisis , and specifically cited contributions from Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Japan , New Zealand and South Korea .\nHe asserted Monday that he and others in the Obama administration are just now \u201c beginning to put together the specific tasks that each nation \u201d will undertake in the growing coalition .\nLate last week , French warplanes began pounding Islamic State targets in northern Iraq . On Monday , French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his nation will not launch any strikes inside Syria . When pressed for an explanation , he said only that Iraq \u2019 s government had requested the strikes .\nSyria has not made such requests and warned weeks ago that it would not let foreign countries bomb Islamic State targets with impunity . Unlike even an uncooperative Iraq , Syria has a military capable of at least attempting resistance to outside strikes .\nMr. Kerry met one-on-one with Mr. Fabius on Sunday , but State Department officials declined to provide details about the meeting . One State Department official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity with reporters , said only that \u201c the bulk of the meeting was devoted to working together to build the coalition to counter \u201d the Islamic State . Mr. Kerry met privately with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on Monday .",
