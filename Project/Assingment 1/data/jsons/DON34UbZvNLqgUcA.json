    "content": "The Donald Trump Show is getting stale , old , and , frankly , a little bit boring .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s big speech before Congress on Tuesday night was the epitome of the show . There was the gross hypocrisy of \u201c the time for trivial fights is behind us , \u201d the campy propagandism of creating a Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office , the prepared remarks in all caps calling to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN .\nShorn of context , to witness a president of the United States deliver a speech so devoid of the customary humility or sense of America \u2019 s role in the world would be shocking . Just as it would ordinarily be shocking to see a president attacking the media as the \u201c enemy of the American people \u201d or denouncing a \u201c so-called judge \u201d or any of the other dozen or so bizarre things that Trump does in a given week .\nHis campaign was fascinating from state to finish \u2014 if at times horrifying \u2014 because of the litany of similar novelties . His business \u2014 brand licensing and real estate \u2014 succeeded by the same attention seeking . His reality TV career is the same story .\nBut Trump is no longer a novelty candidate , a branding magnate , or a B-List TV show host . He \u2019 s now the president of the United States . He \u2019 s the subject of constant , obsessive media attention . And like any overexposed celebrity , he \u2019 s getting tiresome .\nIf you take any one moment from the Trump Show out of context , it \u2019 s striking . But together , Trump \u2019 s antics are now banal . He says , tweets , and does weird things . He gets attention . He pisses people off while thrilling others . Tonight , he even managed to attract attention and garner praise for slightly dialing it down . But speeches are supposed to be tools to help do the work of actually being president \u2014 learning about the issues , making decisions about trade-offs , and collaborating to get things done .\nAmid the nonstop and increasingly tedious theatricality , Trump is only ever performing the role of the president ; he \u2019 s never doing the job .\nOn the campaign trail , a politician gives speeches to energize supporters and to persuade the persuadable . The point of campaigning , for most politicians , is to try to win so they can govern .\nWhen you take office , you continue to make speeches . But \u2014 especially if you are the president \u2014 the speeches then become handmaidens of governance . You give speeches to help put issues on the public agenda , to elevate a particular perspective in Congress , and to say something meaningful about priorities and trade-offs .\nTrump has , it \u2019 s clear , no interest in governing . He only just discovered yesterday that health care policy is complicated . He claims to be deliberately leaving political appointments unfilled as some kind of gesture of small-government zeal , but in reality because he seems too lazy to come up with a properly vetted roster . He clearly had a blast campaigning but had no expectation that he would actually win . That allowed him to campaign in an unusually irresponsible manner \u2014 tossing off incoherent or impossible promises with no consideration of how difficult , or downright impossible , it would be to deliver on them .\nThe surreal campaign that resulted from this \u2014 the Trump Show \u2014 was a thing to behold . But having won , Trump now faces the humdrum task of turning his nonsense into something workable . Yet while there are certainly people plugging away at this \u2014 Reince Priebus , Gary Cohn , Steve Bannon , Mick Mulvaney , and various Cabinet secretaries \u2014 Trump is clearly still focused on the show . Given the chance to reboot and explain what he wants to do , Trump simply gives another campaign rally speech .\nThere are a whole bunch of issues pending in Congress on which it would be useful for the president of the United States to weigh in and attempt to shape the debate .\nOne such issue is the Affordable Care Act , where Republicans would , broadly speaking , like to rescind its tax increases on the rich and pay for them by cutting spending on providing insurance to the poor and the middle class . Some Republicans have gotten leery about the practical implications of this approach , and are now talking about restraining their ambitions somewhat \u2014 leaving the Medicaid expansion in place , for example , or giving states the option to retain the ACA framework . Others are adhering dogmatically to the view that the spending must all go .\nSome indication from Trump about what he is willing to accept and what he thinks should be done would be useful . Instead , he gave us \u2014 as he invariably does when he discusses the topic \u2014 vague platitudes about how \u201c we should help Americans purchase their own coverage , \u201d with no word on how generous that help should be or how it should be paid for .\nOn tax reform , things are much the same . Trump claims that his \u201c team is developing historic tax reform \u201d but told us nothing of the trade-offs it might entail or when a full plan might be available .\nHe talked , extensively , about trade , as he always does . But he talked about it vaguely , as he always does . He said future deals would be \u201c fair \u201d without saying anything about what they would look like or how they would be achieved . The infrastructure portion of the speech described no particular plan , and the reference to a more \u201c merit-based \u201d system for legal immigration likewise offered no details .\nNobody who \u2019 s watched anything Trump has said over the past six months learned anything new , in part because it \u2019 s rarely clear whether even Trump cares about the details of what he says .\nYou can \u2019 t parse a president who doesn \u2019 t sweat the details\nIn a normal address of this sort , the role of a policy reporter is to serve as a kind of translator . Having spent days , weeks , and months following policy debates in Washington , we are able to catch the quick references in the president \u2019 s speech and understand them in fuller context . In that spirit , for example , I might note that Trumps \u2019 reference to creating \u201c a level playing field for American companies and workers \u201d appears to be a move toward endorsing a controversial corporate income tax reform that big exporters like but retail chains hate .\nThe problem is that to draw that conclusion would require us to believe the speech went through a traditional drafting process . That the Treasury secretary and the National Economic Council director and the legislative liaison staff all briefed the president on the meaning of the line , and that he therefore made a coherent , deliberate effort to embrace this plan .\nI feel like I can actually hear the editing battles between Bannon and Priebus in this speech . The tonality really veers around . \u2014 Nick Confessore ( @ nickconfessore ) March 1 , 2017\nBut here \u2019 s another theory . The speech seems to be largely the product of tensions between Reince Priebus \u2019 s traditional Republican Party ideology and Steve Bannon \u2019 s populist nationalism . Priebus is close to Paul Ryan , who likes the controversial tax reform . But one interpretation of the tax reform idea is that it \u2019 s protectionist trade policy , which Bannon likes . So the two of them may have put the line into the speech even though Senate Republicans and the Trump administration economic team seem to think it \u2019 s a bad idea .\nThe premise of taking a close look at these speeches to read the tea leaves , in short , is that the president actually understands the policy issues facing him and cares about the words he \u2019 s speaking . With Trump , that \u2019 s far from true . He doesn \u2019 t like to read briefing books or make hard choices . His words about clean air or infrastructure or anything else are completely meaningless until we see real plans . And there \u2019 s no real indication that we ever will . The show is an increasingly meaningless spectacle .\nNone of this is to say that the Trump administration , as a phenomenon , isn \u2019 t important . American politics and government are always important because they directly impact the lives of millions of people .\nThe Trump show doesn \u2019 t matter . What matters is that thousands of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents in cities across America now feel they have been \u201c unchained \u201d to start enforcing immigration law in a more random , more terrifying manner . Beyond the details of Trump \u2019 s executive orders , reports of Customs and Border Patrol agents at airports stepping up their level of aggression in detaining and questioning harmless foreigners have been ubiquitous . Jewish community centers around the country are experiencing an unprecedented surge of bomb threats . The new attorney general is openly dismissive of Justice Department inquiries into racism and abuses at police departments nationwide \u2014 meaning that misconduct issues are likely to become more severe .\nAt the same time , Trump \u2019 s victory has caused mobilization on the American left that is faster and more powerful than anything I \u2019 ve seen in my lifetime . From the millions who participated in Women \u2019 s March events on inauguration weekend to the rapid-fire mobilization of people and lawyers to counter the first iteration of Trump \u2019 s travel ban , people are active .\nThis resistance to Trump is flooding congressional town hall meetings and has thrown the GOP \u2019 s health care strategy into disarray \u2014 taking the larger legislative agenda with it . Despite considerably lingering tensions between supporters of Hillary Clinton and supporters of Bernie Sanders , Democrats are , on a practical level , working together against Trump \u2014 exemplified by Keith Ellison taking Tom Perez , who recently bested him in the race for DNC chair , as his guest to the speech .\nThe real-world consequences of Trump \u2019 s governance matters enormously , and so does the pushback Trump is getting .
