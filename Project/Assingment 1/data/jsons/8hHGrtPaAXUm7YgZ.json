New York , from the Supreme Court 's last term . That 's when the court was asked to rule on whether the administration could add a citizenship question to the 2020 census .\nThe plaintiffs in that case , as Slate 's Mark Joseph Stern explained in his book American Justice 2019 : The Roberts Court Arrives ( which I had a hand in publishing ) , uncovered convincing evidence that `` the true purpose of the citizenship question was to favor white Republican voters '' ( by discouraging undocumented immigrants from completing the census , thereby lowering population numbers , representation , and federal funding for areas of the country with greater numbers of immigrants , which tend to vote for Democrats ) . But when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced his rationale for adding the census question , he justified it in terms of a need for the government to do a better job of enforcing the Voting Rights Act ( VRA ) . What the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case later discovered is that this rationale was pretextual \u2014 deliberately concocted by a Justice Department lawyer after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked him to work with the Commerce Department to do precisely that .\nRoss knew very well that the question was being added to advantage Republicans , but he devised a deception to conceal it .\nOn substance , Roberts had no objection to the Trump administration adding a citizenship question to the census . Interestingly , the bulk of his majority opinion joining with the high court 's four liberal justices in blocking the question read like it was written to justify siding with the court 's four conservatives in permitting the question . Yet in the last section of the opinion , Robert changed tack , writing that government agencies must `` disclose the basis '' of their actions and not engage in post hoc rationalizations to justify them .
