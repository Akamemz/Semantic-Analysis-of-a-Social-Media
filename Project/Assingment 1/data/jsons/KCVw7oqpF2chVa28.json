There was no similar rash of articles in 2010 asking Barack Obama \u2019 s staunchest supporters in mostly black neighborhoods why they still backed the president , how they justified the soaring unemployment rate , whether they felt betrayed .\nThe reason is that journalists didn \u2019 t miss Obama \u2019 s rise and they weren \u2019 t perplexed by the motivations of his voters ; there was no mystery to solve . Donald Trump , by contrast , blindsided us . The political press \u2014 myself included \u2014 underestimated both the depth and the durability of his support , and has been trying to atone for that mistake , and ensure it \u2019 s not made again , ever since . But in trying to take Trump \u2019 s staunchest supporters seriously , we need to make sure we don \u2019 t lose sight of his weaker supporters \u2014 and his numerous opponents . They \u2019 re the ones who decided the 2016 election and will decide the 2018 and 2020 elections .\nMichael Kruse \u2019 s Politico story revisiting diehard Trump supporters in Johnstown , Pennsylvania , is among the best of these Trump country stories I \u2019 ve seen \u2014 it \u2019 s a tremendous piece of reporting that has a lot to say about our politics . What Kruse discovers is that Trump \u2019 s supporters don \u2019 t care about his broken promises , don \u2019 t believe the swirling scandals , and haven \u2019 t heard many of the dominant criticisms . Their filter bubble leads to bizarre moments like this one :\n\u201c Everybody I talk to , \u201d he said , \u201c realizes it \u2019 s not Trump who \u2019 s dragging his feet . Trump \u2019 s probably the most diligent , hardest-working president we \u2019 ve ever had in our lifetimes . It \u2019 s not like he sleeps in till noon and goes golfing every weekend , like the last president did. \u201d I stopped him , informing him that , yes , Barack Obama liked to golf , but Trump in fact does golf a lot , too \u2014 more , in fact . Del Signore was surprised to hear this . \u201c Does he ? \u201d he said . \u201c Yes , \u201d I said . He did not linger on this topic , smiling and changing the subject with a quip . \u201c If I was married to his wife , \u201d Del Signore said , \u201c I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 d go anywhere . \u201d\nKruse concludes that hardcore support for Trump is more tribal than ideological , more cultural than political , and more interested in whom Trump is fighting than what he is doing . There \u2019 s also quite a bit of racism in the mix . And Kruse gets all of it vividly , powerfully , on the record .\nWhere his story goes awry is in its effort to draw a macro-political conclusion from all that ( emphasis mine ) :\nJohnstown voters do not intend to hold the president accountable for the nonnegotiable pledges he made to them . It \u2019 s not that the people who made Trump president have generously moved the goalposts for him . It \u2019 s that they have eliminated the goalposts altogether . This reality ought to get the attention of anyone who thinks they will win in 2018 or 2020 by running against Trump \u2019 s record . His supporters here , it turns out , are energized by his bombast and his animus more than any actual accomplishments . For them , it \u2019 s evidently not what he \u2019 s doing so much as it is the people he \u2019 s fighting .\nHere \u2019 s the thing : No one will win in 2018 or 2020 by trying to convert the most hardcore of Trump supporters . That isn \u2019 t how elections are won . It never has been : Herbert Hoover , in the depths of the Great Depression , held about 80 percent of his vote from the previous election . You can imagine stories going deep into Hoover country quoting diehard Hooverites explaining away their president \u2019 s failures . But Hoover still lost his reelection bid in a landslide .\nOr take Tuesday \u2019 s elections in Virginia . The massive Democratic victory was driven , among other things , by a surge in turnout from suburban districts that leaned Democratic in 2016 , but swung harder blue in 2017 . The northern Virginia suburbs delivered 64 percent of their vote to Hillary Clinton last year and 68 percent to Ralph Northam this year . A 4 percentage point swing toward the Democratic candidate in 2020 wouldn \u2019 t require converting any hardcore Trump enthusiasts , but it would bury his reelection campaign .\nTrump \u2019 s record matters : he \u2019 s been losing support since he took office\nTrump \u2019 s 2016 Electoral College win included some strong Trump supporters , but it also included a lot of weak Trump supporters and a bunch of voters who disliked Trump but hated Clinton even more .\nOne reason that coalition could come together is that Trump had the advantage of running without a record . He had no unemployment rate to explain , no votes to justify . Even those uncomfortable with his campaign could tell themselves he was just putting on a show , but when he took office , he would govern as the pragmatic businessman who \u2019 d built a multibillion-dollar global brand .\nBut since taking office , he \u2019 s been developing a record , putting his name to bills , letting the American people see how he \u2019 s running the White House , and the result is he \u2019 s consistently losing support . His record very much has mattered :\nMore important than the lines on the chart is the context behind them . Trump didn \u2019 t win in 2016 by a healthy margin . Even with James Comey \u2019 s assist , he lost the popular vote , and the election turned on a mere 74,000 ballots in three states . Which means Trump can \u2019 t lose support and win again in 2020 . He has to expand his coalition , or at least stop it from shrinking . At that , he \u2019 s failing .\nThere are plenty of Trump voters out there who aren \u2019 t deep inside Trump \u2019 s bubble , who don \u2019 t like the fights he \u2019 s constantly picking , who are open to arguments about his record .
