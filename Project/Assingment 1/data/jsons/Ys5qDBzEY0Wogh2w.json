They did also say if there was \"social distancing of the whole population,\" the death toll could be cut in half, but 1.1 million to 1.46 million Americans would still die by this summer.\n\nOur actual death toll has been about one-tenth of that.\n\nNevertheless, Imperial College's model was extremely influential.\n\nPoliticians issued stay-at-home orders. They said we must trust the \"experts.\"\n\n\"Follow the science. Listen to the experts. Do what they tell you,\" said Joe Biden, laughing at what he considered an obvious truth.\n\nBut \"there is no such thing as 'the science!'\" replies science reporter Matt Ridley in my new video about \"expert\" predictions. \"Science consists of people disagreeing with each other!\"\n\nThe lockdowns, he adds, were \"quite dangerously wrong.\"\n\nBecause Imperial's model predicted that COVID-19 would overwhelm hospitals, patients were moved to nursing homes. The coronavirus then spread in nursing homes.\n\nOrdering almost every worker to stay home led to an economic collapse that may have killed people, too.\n\n\"The main interventions that helped prevent people dying were stopping large gatherings, people washing their hands and wearing face masks, general social distancing\u2014not forcing people to stay home,\" says Ridley.\n\nEven New York Gov.

Their model predicted 65,000 deaths from swine flu, 136,000 from mad cow disease, and 200 million from bird flu.\n\nThe real numbers were in the hundreds.\n\nAfter such predictions were repeatedly wrong, why did politicians boss us around based on those same \"experts\" models?\n\n\"If you say something really pessimistic about how many people are going to die,\" explains Ridley, \"the media want to believe you.
