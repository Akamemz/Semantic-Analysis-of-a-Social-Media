    "content": "Congress on Friday approved a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill with a pair of overwhelming bipartisan votes , capping a frenzied final few weeks of legislating before lawmakers head home for the holidays and gear up for the 2016 election year .\nThe House moved first , passing the government funding bill on a 316-113 vote . The Senate followed suit just a few hours later , clearing the legislation \u2014which also included a $ 680 billion tax package that the House cleared on Thursday \u2014 on a 65-33 tally .\n\u201c This legislation helps our economy , helps our national security , and strikes more blows to a partisan health law that hurts the middle class , \u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) on Friday morning . \u201c I think it \u2019 s legislation worth supporting . \u201d\nSpeaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) also praised the package shortly after the House passed it . `` This bipartisan compromise secures meaningful wins for Republicans and the American people , such as the repeal of the outdated , anti-growth ban on oil exports , '' Ryan said in a statement . `` The legislation strengthens our military and protects Americans from terrorist threats , while limiting the overreach of intrusive government bureaucracies like the IRS and the EPA .

Vote counts by party leaders earlier in the day had shown that Democrats were dozens of votes shy of the minimum 100 votes they had promised Republicans .
