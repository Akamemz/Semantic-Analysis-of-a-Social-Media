Darrell E. Issa , California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , and former U.S. prosecutor Victoria Toensing have separately leveled charges that the State Department is blocking clearances for attorneys for potential whistleblowers , who may want someone to help represent them before Congress or help shield them from retaliation afterward because of their testimony .\nMr. Carney said neither the State Department nor the Pentagon had received any requests from lawyers representing anyone tied to the Sept. 11 Benghazi attacks , which killed U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens , State Department officer Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods .\nThe attacks and the administration \u2019 s response to them became a heated issue in the presidential election , and they continue to provoke Republican allegations of a cover-up .\n\u201c So what you have is an attorney saying she represents somebody , claiming that she \u2019 s not getting this security clearance , and yet the agencies involved have no information about that at all , \u201d said Mr. Carney , apparently referring to Ms. Toensing , who aired her charges on Fox News .\nSEE ALSO : FBI posts images of individuals wanted for questioning on Benghazi\nMs. Toensing did not return several requests for comment Wednesday .\nIn a letter Wednesday to Mr. Issa , Thomas B.
