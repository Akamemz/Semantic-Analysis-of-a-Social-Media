Paul Ryan is telling those on the right that the compromise is good for core conservative values .\n\u201c Look at the details , I say to those who are criticizing it . This is keeping our principle intact : no tax increases , net deficit reduction , permanent spending cuts in place of the across-the-board approach , \u201d Mr. Ryan said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\nThe Wisconsin Republican joined Sen. Patty Murray , Washington Democrat , last week to announce the two-year , $ 1.012 trillion plan , which would alleviate some of the sequester cuts and reduce the deficit by $ 23 billion over 10 years .\nThe bill passed the House on Thursday despite criticism from both sides .\nThe Senate is expected to begin considering the bill Tuesday and will have to reach a 60-vote threshold to forward the plan to the president \u2019 s desk .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a step forward that shows that there can be other breakthroughs and compromise if you take the time to know somebody , know what their passions are and know how you can work together , \u201d Ms. Murray said Sunday on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d where she appeared alongside Mr. Ryan .\nSEE ALSO : Sen.
