At least five other Republicans are undecided on it: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, John McCain of Arizona and Jerry Moran of Kansas.\n\nRepublican Senator John Thune on Fox News said: \u201cWe\u2019re a handful of votes short of having the 50 that we need.\u201d\n\nAs they worked to gather enough votes to win, after prior legislation failed in July, congressional Republicans and the White House were on the defensive after Jimmy Kimmel used his late-night TV show to blast the proposal and call Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, one of its two sponsors, a liar.\n\n\u201cThis guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face,\u201d Kimmel said on his show on Tuesday night, referring to the senator who since May had touted a \u201cJimmy Kimmel test\u201d of standards any Obamacare replacement would need to possess.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was noncommittal on Tuesday about scheduling a vote, now intends to bring it to the Senate floor next week, said his spokesman David Popp.\n\nRepublicans are using the measure Cassidy is sponsoring with fellow Senator Lindsey Graham to make one last push this year to pass legislation to roll back the 2010 Obamacare law, a goal of theirs for seven years, facing a Sept. 30 deadline.\n\nAvalere Health, a healthcare consultancy to hospitals and insurers, forecast that the bill would slash federal funding to states by $215 billion through 2026, with 34 states facing cuts.\n\nHit hard would be Democratic-governed California and New York, which expanded the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled under Obamacare, while Republican-governed Texas, which did not expand Medicaid, would be a winner, Avalere said.\n\nIt remained unclear if the bill, opposed by Democrats and top medical groups and hospitals, can attract the 50 votes needed for passage, with Vice President Mike Pence ready to cast a tie-breaking vote.\n\nOBAMA WARNS\n\nIn a speech in New York, Obama defended the Affordable Care Act, known informally as Obamacare, which expanded medical insurance to 20 million Americans.\n\n\u201cSo when I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions ... it is aggravating,\u201d the Democratic former president said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents.\u201d\n\nCassidy defended his bill, which would divvy up healthcare money as block grants to states, let them opt out of some Obamacare consumer protections and waive requirements that insurers cover certain benefits. It also would end Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nKimmel entered the healthcare debate after revealing on his show in May that his newborn son had undergone life-saving emergency surgery for a congenital heart condition, and pleaded that no family be denied medical care because they cannot afford it. Cassidy appeared that month on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he would only support a healthcare bill that made sure a child like mine would get the health coverage he needs no matter how much money his parents make,\u201d Kimmel said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cStop using my name, OK?
