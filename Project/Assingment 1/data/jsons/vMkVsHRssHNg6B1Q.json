    "content": "Fears of chaos inside the Republican National Convention have subsided as Donald Trump has tightened his grip on the party \u2019 s presidential nomination . But outside the arena , a mishmash of planned demonstrations and marches is raising safety concerns about what happens when protesters , police and convention participants converge on the streets of Cleveland .\n\u201c I am sure it \u2019 s going to inflame beyond anything I \u2019 ve seen , \u201d said Kendal Unruh , a Colorado delegate who \u2019 s attended seven national GOP conventions .\nTrump \u2019 s candidacy has been proved to provoke passions and even violent confrontations \u2014 sparked by supporters and critics alike \u2014 at his campaign rallies around the country . Violent clashes between Trump protesters and police in New Mexico this week reignited concerns about the ability of law enforcement and Secret Service to tamp down on sharper confrontations at the convention , a magnet for protesters even in a typical election year .\n\u201c I would feel much more secure if they would allow me to carry my pistol into the convention , \u201d said Dale Jackson , a delegate from Georgia ( who said he always feels safer when he \u2019 s able to bring a gun ) , adding that he \u2019 s not worried about safety inside the Secret Service security bubble but on the outskirts , where protests will be massing .\nSo far , more than half a dozen protests and marches \u2014 including one anti-Trump rally whose organizers are predicting 10,000 participants on the day Trump is expected to formally claim the nomination \u2014 are seeking permits to parade through Cleveland during the convention . The planners of those events insist they \u2019 re taking precautions to encourage nonviolence , but some fear that the strong feelings Trump engenders among supporters and detractors alike will create a combustible atmosphere . In a filing with the city , one pro-Trump march organizer noted that his group is planning to contract with \u201c a private security company and off-duty police officers to escort and assist us \u201d in daily marches in support of the mogul .\n\u201c Although we do not anticipate any problems , taking this precautionary measure will help to ensure that march participants are strictly adhering to all traffic signals as they proceed from one site to another , \u201d noted the organizer , Michael Freilinger , in the official filing .\nThough the Secret Service , Cleveland police and state troopers will turn the city \u2019 s Quicken Loans Arena into a virtual fortress , the swirling mix of pro- and anti-Trump forces that will be swarming the city \u2014 culminating in the big anti-Trump rally \u2014 is heightening delegates \u2019 anxiety . The most acute concerns aren \u2019 t over the preponderance of protesters , who insist they \u2019 ll be peaceful . It \u2019 s the instigators and provocateurs , for and against Trump , who could tip emotional marches toward physical clashes .\n\u201c There is a professional protest crowd that I \u2019 m sure will be out , \u201d said Matt Borges , chairman of the Ohio GOP .\n\u201c I have no doubt the professional agitators \u2026 will seek to foment violence , \u201d added Roger Stone , a Trump ally who is planning a pro-Trump march during the convention . Stone , who himself has faced criticism for warning of chaos in Cleveland if Trump is denied the nomination , named liberal groups like Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org as culprits for stoking violence at earlier Trump rallies . Stone said concerns about unruly crowds prompted the city of Cleveland to slow the issuance rally permits until two weeks before the convention , a move he said he suspected was to \u201c minimize crowd size . \u201d\n\u201c Trump supporters should eschew violence at all costs , \u201d Stone added . \u201c It is important to note that violence at Trump 's rallies has actually backfired and gained Trump votes . \u201d\nCleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and city Police Chief Calvin Williams joined Secret Service officials Wednesday to outline convention logistics , including security measures , from naming an official \u201c parade route \u201d for protests and an \u201c event zone \u201d within which rallies and gatherings will take place . Ron Rowe , the Secret Service \u2019 s RNC coordinator , said his team has \u201c been here on the ground full time since last fall . \u201d\n\u201c I can \u2019 t stress enough that we are prepared for this , \u201d added Williams , who said he \u2019 s signing agreements with partner law enforcement agencies around the country to assist with convention security .\nCity officials said protests must be finished by 2 p.m. on most convention days , and no vehicles will be permitted , only marchers on foot . Unplanned or unregistered protests will be permitted on a \u201c case by case \u201d basis , so long as they don \u2019 t block traffic or compromise public safety , Williams added . There will also be an official \u201c speakers \u2019 platform \u201d on Public Square \u2014 a half-mile from the convention arena \u2014 to allow members of the public to speak in half-hour increments from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day . Objects like fireworks and drones will be banned in the area nearby the arena .\nIn addition , the RNC 's Committee on Arrangements already has plans in place to keep state delegations secure . The delegations will receive transportation on buses to and from the convention site , and each bus is expected to have security on board . The convention hotels are also slated to have cops on duty overnight , and some delegations are also bringing their own security for elected officials , said Kansas GOP chairman Kelly Arnold , a member of the Committee on Arrangements .\nThough those precautions have largely allayed concerns about safety inside and around the arena , the atmosphere on the streets is another matter .\nUnruh , the Colorado delegate , said she \u2019 s convinced the 2016 convention protests will be more confrontational than others because of a changing political and media landscape . Social media , she said , have enabled protesters to organize and agitate more easily . Then there \u2019 s TV , which \u201c feeds off \u201d footage of protests , she added . And finally , Unruh noted , police officers have been hammered for overly aggressive actions in recent years , which she said might make them \u201c afraid to act like police officers and do their job \u201d while in the glare of the national spotlight . The Cleveland Police , in particular , have been under intense scrutiny in the aftermath of the shooting of Tamir Rice , an unarmed 12-year-old boy .\nRepublican National Convention officials and the Secret Service have long insisted they \u2019 re prepared for the convention , which has been designated a National Special Security Event , a label that triggers a slew of homeland security preparations \u2014 including setting restrictions on the manner and location of protests . \u201c When people break those restrictions , they \u2019 ll be dealt with appropriately , \u201d said Nicole Mainor a Secret Service spokeswoman , in a recent interview .\nThe RNC noted that the Secret Service has been meeting regularly with federal and local law enforcement partners .\n\u201c Whether it \u2019 s within the perimeter , on the transportation system or at their hotels , we have safety plans in place and we will be in communication with the necessary people as we get closer to convention , \u201d said Audrey Scagnelli , a spokeswoman for the RNC \u2019 s convention planning committee .\nProtest organizers insist that they \u2019 re planning peaceful events . Bryan Hambley , who \u2019 s leading the Stand Together Against Trump rally on Thursday \u2014 a march he predicts will draw 10,000 people on the day Trump is expected to claim the nomination \u2014 said he and other leaders will be hosting \u201c full-day peace and nonviolence training \u201d the weekend before the convention . He said he \u2019 s heard of no plans by Trump opponents to stir trouble and that he \u2019 s working to partner with national organizations that oppose Trump to increase the size of his group \u2019 s rally , which he said would focus \u201c particularly against the sexist and racist comments that he \u2019 s made . \u201d\n\u201c We absolutely are planning a peaceful march and rally , \u201d he said . \u201c We absolutely agree with convention attendees . They have every right to peacefully assemble \u2026 Trying to instigate some kind of yelling match or even worse is not at all the goal of ours . \u201d\nGOP leaders have become increasingly confident that the convention itself will be orderly inside the arena and that concerns about clashes among delegates have subsided . RNC members , state party leaders and delegates \u2014 once wary of threats and internal turmoil when it was unclear whether Trump would clinch the nomination \u2014 have been breathing sighs of relief .\n\u201c There were people from various campaigns threatening riots , \u201d noted Borges . \u201c That was over an issue that doesn \u2019 t exist anymore . \u201d\n\u201c I do n't think there 's any question the tensions are going to be much lower than they would have been at a contested convention , \u201d added Henry Barbour , an RNC member from Mississippi .\nRepublicans have largely expressed confidence in the security planning of the Secret Service and the RNC after airing concerns at a meeting of state party chairmen in Florida last month . RNC leaders assured them that the convention would be safe and that family members and friends should be encouraged to attend .\n\u201c Now , the focus is on securing the perimeter of the convention , \u201d said Matt Moore , chairman of the South Carolina GOP . \u201c I don \u2019 t expect any problems within the convention itself .
