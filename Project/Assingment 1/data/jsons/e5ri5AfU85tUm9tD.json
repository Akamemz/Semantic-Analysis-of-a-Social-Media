    "content": "After President Trump \u2019 s popularity on social media helped propel him to an upset victory in 2016 , Democrats vowed to catch up .\nTwo years later , their efforts appear to be paying off .\nA New York Times analysis of data from the Facebook and Instagram accounts of hundreds of candidates in next month \u2019 s midterm elections reveals that Democrats \u2014 and especially Democrats running for House seats \u2014 enjoy a sizable national lead in engagement on the two influential platforms .\nIn Most House Races , Democrats Had More Facebook Interactions Than Their Opponents MINNESOTA \u2019 S 8th DISTRICT The Republican running for this open seat had 3,300 more interactions on Facebook than his opponent . Outlined circles indicate the most competitive races . WISCONSIN \u2019 S 1st DISTRICT The Democrat running for Speaker Paul D. Ryan \u2019 s open seat in Wisconsin had 318,000 more interactions . FLORIDA \u2019 S 27th DISTRICT The Republican running for this district \u2019 s open seat had 10,000 more interactions .

ME-2 UT-4 VA-2 NM-2 FL-27 FL-26 Republican Democrat Competitive race = 15,000 more Facebook interactions than opponent Circles are sized based on the margin by which candidates had more Facebook interactions than their opponents . Facebook interactions include likes , comments and shares over 30 days ending Oct. 15 . Competitive races are based on those rated as \u201c toss-ups \u201d by Cook Political Report as of Oct. 15 . Races with only one major-party candidate are not included . | Source : CrowdTangle\nBut the analysis of the engagement data , which includes all non-advertising content , also shows that Republicans in many closely contested races for Senate and governor are faring better on Facebook than their Democratic challengers .\nThe data , collected from more than 53,000 posts by more than 1,100 accounts , reflects a month \u2019 s worth of social media activity by nearly all of the Republican and Democratic candidates running for House , Senate or governor this year . The data , which covers 30 days ending Oct. 15 , was gathered using a Facebook-owned tool called CrowdTangle . The tool counts the number of times users comment on , react to or share a user \u2019 s posts , a measure of popularity known as \u201c total interactions . \u201d\nThe data includes public posts made by candidates on Facebook and Instagram . It does not include paid ads unless those ads began as organic , non-paid posts that were subsequently \u201c boosted \u201d using Facebook \u2019 s advertising tools . It also does not include activity on private accounts , or posts made visible only to specific groups of followers . In instances where candidates had an official government account as well as a campaign account , both accounts were included in the calculations . In some instances , politicians who are independent , but who caucus with Democrats or Republicans , were included on those parties \u2019 lists .\nTogether , the data amounts to a revealing picture of how those candidates \u2019 messages are resonating with a digital audience , and how social media activity both mirrors and departs from more traditional polling methods .\nIt also shows that Democrats often dominate the conversation on Instagram , but Republican candidates are finding their biggest audiences on Facebook , the largest and most influential social network .\nMeasuring total interactions on social media is an imperfect way to gauge a candidate \u2019 s electoral chances , in part because it does not distinguish between types of engagement . A negative comment left on a Republican candidate \u2019 s page by an angry Democrat would still count as an interaction , for example . In addition , it does not account for the fact that some candidates have more followers than others .\nBut social media engagement can be a crude measure of popularity , and a bellwether of shifts in public opinion that often turn up in polls days or weeks later . In 2016 , many polls and pundits gave Mr. Trump little chance of winning , but his performance on Facebook was soaring , bolstered by millions of dollars in targeted advertising . His digital campaign director , Brad Parscale , later credited Facebook \u2019 s scale and influence with his victory .\nAs some Republican lawmakers accuse Facebook of anti-conservative bias , the party \u2019 s candidates are still intensely interested in using it to get elected . Even the most tech-skeptical candidates have recognized that when it comes to modern political campaigning , there is no avoiding Facebook .\n\u201c Facebook is the most widespread platform , and for campaigns , it \u2019 s like broadcast television , \u201d said Tim Lim , a Democratic digital consultant . \u201c You have so much reach , and so many ad units , and probably more eyeballs than anywhere else . \u201d\nAt the national level , Democrats on Facebook and Instagram appear to be winning the battle for social media supremacy in a landslide .\nInteractions with posts on candidates \u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day period Senate candidates 10m Democrats Republicans 2.2m House candidates 3.5m Democrats Republicans 1.5m Gubernatorial candidates 1.6m Democrats Republicans 1.7m Interactions with posts on candidates \u2019 Facebook pages over the 30-day period Senate candidates 10m Democrats Republicans 2.2m House candidates 3.5m Democrats Republicans 1.5m Gubernatorial candidates 1.6m Democrats Republicans 1.7m Interactions on Facebook include shares , comments and likes . | Source : CrowdTangle\nDemocrats running for House , Senate and governor \u2019 s seats in this fall \u2019 s elections received a combined 15.1 million interactions on Facebook in the 30-day period , roughly three times the 5.4 million interactions received by Republican candidates .\nSome of the Democrats \u2019 social media gains can be attributed to a well-organized online resistance movement . An influx of small-dollar donations has given Democrats a large fund-raising lead , which has allowed them to spend more on digital campaigning and advertising .

His most popular post , in which he accused Ms. Abrams of raising money from \u201c radical liberals who want to turn Georgia into the next California , \u201d was shared more than 9,000 times .\nIn close House races , things look a bit better for Democrats . Of the 31 House races listed as toss-ups by Cook Political Report , Democratic candidates received more interactions than their Republican opponents in 23 of them .\nCandidates from both parties appear to have benefited from the late September fervor surrounding the contentious confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh , which galvanized conservatives in his favor and created a surge in left-wing support for Christine Blasey Ford , who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault .\nBut Republicans in close races appear to have benefited slightly more from a \u201c Kavanaugh bump \u201d than Democrats .\nIn Indiana \u2019 s Senate race , Mike Braun , the Republican running against the incumbent Democrat , Joe Donnelly , was trailing Mr. Donnelly in Facebook interactions for the two weeks leading up to Sept. 27 , the day that Dr. Blasey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee .\nFor nearly three weeks following the testimony , Mr. Braun led Mr. Donnelly on Facebook by a significant margin .\n50k Facebook interactions 40k Week of Blasey- Kavanaugh hearing Christine Blasey Ford identified 30k 20k 10k Sen.

Democratic Senate candidates saw an increase of just 30 percent .\nRepublicans in toss-up races may have benefited even more from the Kavanaugh effect . Among the nine most competitive Senate races , interactions on Facebook for Republicans rose by 94 percent during the week of Sept. 30 . Interactions for Democrats in those races remained flat .\nPolitical strategists disagree about the importance of social media popularity . Some think it amounts to a kind of real-time voter sentiment index , while others play it down as , at most , one piece of a successful campaign .\n\u201c Retweets don \u2019 t vote , \u201d Mr. Strauss of Swing Left said . \u201c All of this social engagement is really just a proxy for the results that matter , which is what happens at the polls on Nov. 6 . \u201d\nFor Republicans who are worried about a wave of progressive enthusiasm sweeping Democrats to victory , though , the data from swing district social media accounts may be comforting .",

Of the 31 House races listed as toss-ups by Cook Political Report, Democratic candidates received more interactions than their Republican opponents in 23 of them.\n\nRepublicans Benefited More From the Kavanaugh Effect\n\nCandidates from both parties appear to have benefited from the late September fervor surrounding the contentious confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh, which galvanized conservatives in his favor and created a surge in left-wing support for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\n\nBut Republicans in close races appear to have benefited slightly more from a \u201cKavanaugh bump\u201d than Democrats.\n\nIn Indiana\u2019s Senate race, Mike Braun, the Republican running against the incumbent Democrat, Joe Donnelly, was trailing Mr. Donnelly in Facebook interactions for the two weeks leading up to Sept. 27, the day that Dr. Blasey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nFor nearly three weeks following the testimony, Mr. Braun led Mr. Donnelly on Facebook by a significant margin.\n\n50k Facebook interactions 40k Week of Blasey- Kavanaugh hearing Christine Blasey Ford identified 30k 20k 10k Sen.

Democratic Senate candidates saw an increase of just 30 percent.\n\nRepublicans in toss-up races may have benefited even more from the Kavanaugh effect. Among the nine most competitive Senate races, interactions on Facebook for Republicans rose by 94 percent during the week of Sept. 30. Interactions for Democrats in those races remained flat.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cLike\u201d Worth?\n\nPolitical strategists disagree about the importance of social media popularity. Some think it amounts to a kind of real-time voter sentiment index, while others play it down as, at most, one piece of a successful campaign.\n\n\u201cRetweets don\u2019t vote,\u201d Mr. Strauss of Swing Left said. \u201cAll of this social engagement is really just a proxy for the results that matter, which is what happens at the polls on Nov. 6.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans who are worried about a wave of progressive enthusiasm sweeping Democrats to victory, though, the data from swing district social media accounts may be comforting.",
