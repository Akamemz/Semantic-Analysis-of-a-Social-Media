    "content": "\u201c We \u2019 ve been amazingly resilient thus far in the face of all these headwinds , \u201d said Ellen Zentner , the senior United States economist for Nomura Securities International , referring to global obstacles like the slowdown in China and domestic ones like the looming expiration of tax breaks . \u201c But it \u2019 s awfully hard to see getting significantly above that growth range given that these headwinds are still in place . \u201d\nStill , an energized Mr. Obama seized on the statistics as he campaigned in Virginia and Ohio , seeking to regain his footing after a listless performance in the first debate this week . Mr. Romney , whose muscular showing in Denver had emboldened his campaign , scrambled to play down the report , saying it merely confirmed that millions of Americans had given up looking for work .\nIn back-to-back rallies in Virginia , the president declared , \u201c This country has come too far to turn back. \u201d His Republican challenger then insisted , \u201c We don \u2019 t have to stay on the path we \u2019 ve been on . We can do better . \u201d\nSome Romney backers , led by the former chief executive of General Electric , John F. Welch Jr. , suggested that the White House had massaged the Labor Department data to make it more favorable . The Obama administration , economic experts and some Republicans dismissed that notion as a groundless conspiracy theory .\nThe jobs report was preceded by other signs of growing economic strength , including a jump in consumer confidence , the strongest auto sales in four years , rallying stock prices and , at long last , a stabilization of housing prices .\nAccording to the monthly survey of employers , the bulk of the gains came from service jobs , particularly in education and health care . Though government downsizing has been a drag on the recovery , government over all added 10,000 jobs in September , the third consecutive month of gains .\nThe nation \u2019 s employers have added an average of 146,000 jobs a month in 2012 , just ahead of the numbers that are considered necessary to absorb new workers into the labor force . \u201c This is not what a real recovery looks like , \u201d Mr. Romney said in a statement .\nAreas of weakness included manufacturing , one of the bright spots that Mr. Obama has showcased throughout the re-election campaign . It lost 16,000 jobs after a revised 22,000 drop in August in the face of a global slowdown . The number of temporary jobs , usually considered a harbinger of future growth , fell 2,000 . Speaking to a rain-soaked crowd of 9,000 at Cleveland State University , Mr. Obama said , \u201c Today \u2019 s news should give us some encouragement . It shouldn \u2019 t be an excuse for the other side to talk down the economy just to try to score some political points . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve made too much progress to return to the policies that led to this crisis in the first place , \u201d the president said to cheers .\nThe nation now has nearly the same number of jobs as when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009 . Since the economy stopped hemorrhaging jobs in February 2010 , there has been an increase of more than 4.3 million . A mere 61,000-job increase would allow Mr. Obama to claim a net gain in jobs over his tenure .\nThe White House has already made that claim based on one measurement . In an annual recalibration last month , the Bureau of Labor Statistics said 400,000 more jobs were added in the 12 months that ended in March than previously thought . Such revisions are common , but the adjustment process is slow \u2014 that new benchmark will not be incorporated into the monthly jobs figures until early next year .\nMr. Romney , on other hand , said the lower rate spoke to a nation short of hope . The rate , he asserted , would be about 11 percent if the same percentage of people were looking for work now as on the day Mr. Obama was elected .\n\u201c If you just dropped out of the labor force , if you just give up and say , \u2018 Look , I can \u2019 t go back to work , I \u2019 m just going to stay home , \u2019 if you just drop out altogether , why , you \u2019 re no longer part of the employment statistics , so it looks like unemployment is getting better , \u201d Mr. Romney said at a farm equipment dealership in Abingdon , Va .\nThat was true in August , when the rate dropped to 8.1 percent , from 8.3 percent . But this time , the statistics showed that more people were working , not that discouraged job seekers had stopped looking for work .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .
