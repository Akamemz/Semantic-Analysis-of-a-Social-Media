    "content": "Barack Obama said before the New Hampshire primary during his contentious primary with Hillary Clinton in 2008 that she was `` likable enough . '' The quip got him in trouble with Clinton supporters , but Clinton 's likability is at the heart of her candidacy in 2016 .\nClinton has a massive lead among Democratic candidates , but polls out in key swing states Wednesday raise warning signs for her candidacy .\nThe latest numbers from Quinnipiac show that the majority of voters in Colorado , Iowa and Virginia have a negative impression of her . A whopping 56 percent of Colorado voters have an unfavorable view of her , compared with only 35 percent who have a favorable one . That gap is similar in Iowa ( 56 percent negative to 33 percent positive ) and only somewhat diminished in Virginia ( 50 percent favorable to 41 percent negative ) . ( The poll had a margin of error of +/- 2.8 percentage points in all three states . )\nIs that bad ?
