    "content": "Lawmakers are pushing to impose federal standards for protecting the country 's electric grid from attack in the wake of a new report about a sniper assault on a California electrical substation last year that has raised fears the power grid is vulnerable to terrorism .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she and fellow senators plan to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which has jurisdiction over the electric grid 's reliability , to `` set minimum security standards for critical substations . ''\nThe April 16 , 2013 the attack on Pacific Gas & Electric \u2019 s Metcalf transmission substation involved snipping AT & T fiber-optic lines to knock out phone and 911 service , and firing shots into a PG & E substation , causing outages . The assault had not been widely publicized until The Wall Street Journal reported new details in a story on Wednesday .\nThe FBI is the lead agency in the investigation and an agency spokesman told the newspaper it doesn \u2019 t think the incident was a terror attack . However , Jon Wellinghoff , chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the time , called it `` the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the U.S. power grid that has ever occurred . ''\nThe incident began when intruders lifted heavy manhole covers at about 1:30 a.m. in two places on Monterey Highway south of San Jose , climbed under the road , and cut AT & T fiber optic cables , temporarily knocking out 911 service and phone service .\nIn a 19-minute period , gunmen fired more than 100 rounds into substation equipment , disabling 17 of 20 big transformers , causing about $ 16 million in damage , according to The Wall Street Journal .
