    "content": "A record high number of voters now oppose the 2010 Affordable Care Act and a record low number supports it , according to the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll .\nIn addition , a majority thinks the new law will increase their health care costs , while few think it will improve their quality of care .\nThe new poll finds 59 percent of voters oppose the health care law , up from 55 percent who opposed it six months ago ( June 2013 ) . The increase in opposition comes from both independents and Democrats .\nNearly a third of Democrats -- 30 percent -- oppose the law , up from 22 percent in June .\nOpposition among independents went from 53 percent to 64 percent today .\nOverall , 36 percent of voters favor the new health care law . That \u2019 s down from 40 percent in June and marks a new low .\nSixty-four percent of Democrats , 29 percent of independents and 11 percent of Republicans like the law .\nEnrollment in the Obama health care exchanges began October 1 and the requirement to have qualifying coverage started January 1 .\nSome apparent reasons for opposition to the law include the fact that majorities think the new law will increase their taxes ( 63 percent ) , increase their insurance costs ( 62 percent ) and increase the federal deficit ( 56 percent ) .\nMeanwhile , just one voter in five thinks Obamacare will increase the quality of their health care ( 19 percent ) . More than twice as many expect the quality of their care to get worse ( 39 percent ) and another 37percent think it will stay the same .\nBy a 44-36 percent margin , voters think the quality of health care for all Americans will decrease rather than increase as a result of the new law .\nVoters disapprove of the job President Obama is doing on health care by a 59-38 percent margin .\nHis highest rating on health care was 48 percent approval in September 2012 , while his lowest was 36 percent in November 2013 .\nSome lawmakers are questioning the security of the health care exchanges and raise the possibility of identity theft for participants .
