Those questions remain unanswered as of Friday , after news broke that Robert Harward , a retired Navy vice admiral with decades of military-leadership experience , turned down Trump \u2019 s offer to take over as national security adviser after the president reportedly denied Harward \u2019 s request to replace the former Fox News pundit who would be serving as his deputy .\nThe initial news of Harward \u2019 s potential appointment came as a relief to national-security experts , who voiced their opinion online and elsewhere and reportedly respect Harward as a professional , not an ideologue , as Flynn was perceived by many .
