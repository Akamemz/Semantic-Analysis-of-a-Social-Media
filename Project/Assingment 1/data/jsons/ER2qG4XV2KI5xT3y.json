That argument , they insist , can draw enough new , irregular voters to defeat Trump in November .\n\u201c We need to be honest here , \u201d retorted Texas Rep.

Filemon Vela , also a border-district congressman who backs Biden , was not so absolute . But he said Biden is best positioned for a general election on immigration because of his plans to roll back Trump \u2019 s immigration restrictions and boost the asylum process , while stopping short of decriminalizing all border crossings . Sanders supports making all border crossings civil offenses , rather than criminal , a position first pushed by the lone Hispanic presidential candidate and former Obama housing secretary Julian Castro .\n\u201c In some swing states , that might not go over well , \u201d Vela said , even as he , Gonzalez and C\u00e1rdenas said the distinction is more important to political pundits than to Hispanic voters .\nSaid C\u00e1rdenas : \u201c There is activist language and there are litmus tests ; and there are hard-working people around the country who just want fairness . \u201d\nHe added another key plank of Biden \u2019 s case : that meaningful change , from reversing Trump \u2019 s migrant family separation policy to expanding health care coverage , requires not only winning in November but then achieving some semblance of consensus in Congress .\nHispanic voters are a rapidly growing portion of the U.S. population and electorate , though they have consistently had lower election-participation rates than African Americans and non-Hispanic whites . At the least , Hispanics will play key roles in the Nevada caucus ( third in the Democratic nominating process ) and the Texas and California primaries , the two largest sources of delegates on the March 3 Super Tuesday slate .\nSanders leads Biden among younger voters generally , according to national polling , and Biden aides say that could carry over to Hispanics . The variable is seemingly on display when comparing Biden \u2019 s campaign crowds with those like Ocasio-Cortez drew this weekend in California and Nevada .\nImmigrants-rights advocates picketed outside Biden \u2019 s Philadelphia campaign headquarters shortly after its opening .
