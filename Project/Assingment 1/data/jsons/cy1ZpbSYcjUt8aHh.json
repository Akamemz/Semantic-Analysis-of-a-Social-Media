    "content": "Sen. Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) has a big idea : give 15 local areas federal money so they can guarantee all their residents a job .\nThe Federal Jobs Guarantee Development Act , announced by Booker on Friday , would establish a three-year pilot program in which the Department of Labor would select up to 15 local areas ( defined in the bill as any political subdivision of a state , like a city or a county , or a group of cities and counties ) and offer that area funding so that every adult living there is guaranteed a job paying at least $ 15 an hour ( or the prevailing wage for the job in question , whichever \u2019 s higher ) and offering paid family/sick leave and health benefits .\nThe idea of a government job guarantee ensuring all adults who want employment get it has a long history in American politics , but it has gained popularity as the Democratic Party has sought to embrace bigger and more ambitious economic policies in the wake of the 2016 election .\nBooker \u2019 s plan is essentially a pilot version of a proposal from Duke \u2019 s Mark Paul and William Darity , Jr. and the New School \u2019 s Darrick Hamilton , economists who have , together and individually , advocated a job guarantee for years , well before the current surge in enthusiasm . Most recently , Paul , Darity , and Hamilton wrote up their proposal for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a highly influential left-of-center think tank , in a clear sign the idea was gaining traction . Booker \u2019 s bill is an even bigger step forward .\n\u201c The federal jobs guarantee is an idea that demands to be taken seriously , \u201d Booker said in a statement . \u201c Creating an employment guarantee would give all Americans a shot at a day \u2019 s work and , by introducing competition into the labor market , raise wages and improve benefits for all workers . \u201d\nThe idea of a job guarantee serves both a policy and a political purpose .\nOn the policy side , a job guarantee would , in theory , effectively end recessions in America . Right now , the US government \u2019 s strategy when the economy stops growing is to use a combination of monetary stimulus ( in which the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates or buys up billions of dollars of long-term bonds ) and fiscal stimulus ( as in the 2009 stimulus package , which blended a boost in spending with temporary tax cuts ) .\nFor a variety of political and institutional factors , the Fed and Congress weren \u2019 t able to do enough in 2008 to 2010 to prevent unemployment from breaking 10 percent , and they certainly weren \u2019 t able to effect a full recovery within a couple years . Returning to normal unemployment rates took nearly a decade , resulting in years of human misery and lost wage gains that a healthier and faster recovery could \u2019 ve delivered .\nJob guarantee advocates argue that their plan effectively creates a permanent form of fiscal stimulus that politicians wouldn \u2019 t need to scramble to pass whenever disaster hits . Instead , if the economy took a turn for the worse and companies started shedding jobs , the government would automatically soak up anyone who \u2019 s laid off and give them work . That , in turn , would put more money in consumers \u2019 pockets , boosting demand and improving business \u2019 prospects . Before you know it , the economy \u2019 s back to normal .\nAdvocates argue the policy could prove beneficial during economic booms as well . The fruits of economic recoveries and booms aren \u2019 t evenly shared , demographically . As of March 2018 , 60.7 percent of white people in America were employed , but only 58.4 percent of black people were .\nOnce black men \u2019 s disproportionate representation in prisons and jails is accounted for , the gap grows still larger . In 2016 , the most recent year for which we have data , a mere 27.7 percent of people with disabilities age 16 to 64 were employed , compared to 72.8 percent of nondisabled people .\nNor do booms affect all geographic areas equally . There are still 337 counties or county-equivalents with a combined labor force of over 6.7 million people that have unemployment rates of 7 percent or higher as of February 2018 . Seventy-eight counties , like Yuma , Arizona , still have unemployment rates in excess of 10 percent .\nA job guarantee would , in principle , lessen those inequalities . People in struggling regions would be guaranteed work without having to move . Black Americans and disabled Americans wouldn \u2019 t be expected to wait until employers have run out of white and nondisabled people to hire until they get their chance .\nFinally , advocates argue that the policy would lead to an increase in wages for everyone . That \u2019 s a big benefit at a time when unemployment is low but wage growth is still sluggish .\nThink of it this way : Walmart pays its employees a minimum of $ 10 per hour ; part-time employees aren \u2019 t guaranteed benefits like health insurance or a 401 ( k ) match .\nIf you \u2019 re a part-time employee at Walmart , and all of a sudden you can get $ 15 an hour , work full time , and earn full benefits by working for the federal government \u2014 wouldn \u2019 t you ? And , knowing that , wouldn \u2019 t Walmart try to increase wages to keep you ?\nAdvocates say Walmart would . And they have some empirical evidence on their side from India , where a type of job guarantee known as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme functions largely as an insurance system , offering a source of income for rural farmers during the dry season .\nA group of economists \u2014 UC San Diego \u2019 s Karthik Muralidharan and Paul Niehaus and the University of Virginia \u2019 s Sandip Sukhtankar \u2014 found that the job guarantee , they estimate , increased earnings for low-income households by 13.3 percent . Ninety percent of that increase is due to higher wages and increased work in the private sector , not the job guarantee program itself .\nJust as job guarantee advocates would predict , the program bid up wages everywhere . Perhaps the most surprising result was that the program not only increased wages , but increased employment in the private sector .\nThe political case for a job guarantee \u2014 and the challenges it faces\nThe fact that Cory Booker , a rising star in the Democratic Party and a likely 2020 contender who faces considerable skepticism from the left due to his stances on education and Wall Street , has endorsed experimenting with a job guarantee is a clear indication that some in the party think it could be a political winner as well as a policy advance .\nIn the wake of the 2016 election , liberal commentators have latched onto the job guarantee as a way to forge a cross-racial working-class coalition . They need a plan that appeals to both to the white Wisconsin and Michigan voters who switched from Obama to Trump and to black and Latino workers left behind by deindustrialization . The ideal plan would both improve conditions for lower-income Americans while supporting Americans \u2019 strong intuition that people should work to earn their crust .\n\u201c A federal job guarantee is both universal\u2014it benefits all Americans\u2014and specifically ameliorative to entrenched racial inequality , \u201d Slate \u2019 s Jamelle Bouie noted .\n\u201c The job guarantee asserts that , if individuals bear a moral duty to work , then society and employers bear a reciprocal moral duty to provide good , dignified work for all , \u201d Jeff Spross added in the influential center-left journal Democracy .\n\u201c If Democrats want to win elections , they should imbue Trump \u2019 s empty rhetoric with a real promise : a good job for every American who wants one , \u201d wrote Bryce Covert in the New Republic . \u201c It \u2019 s time to make a federal jobs guarantee the central tenet of the party \u2019 s platform . \u201d\nAs with any sufficiently big idea , however , a job guarantee comes with risks . It would be expensive , for one thing . Paul , Darity , and Hamilton \u2019 s plan , as outlined for the CBPP , would cost $ 543 billion per year , they estimate . For context , that rivals the size of Medicare , which will cost $ 707 billion this year , and the size of the defense budget , which totals $ 622 billion . The Center for American Progress has proposed a more modest $ 158 billion per year government jobs plan , but it wouldn \u2019 t actually guarantee a job to all who sought one , as Paul , Darity , and Hamilton have proposed . Booker \u2019 s bill doesn \u2019 t have an estimated cost yet .\nSecond , it \u2019 s not clear what exactly participants in a job guarantee scheme would do . Most proposals are somewhat vague on this point , mentioning everything from child care to infrastructure . The Booker bill leaves most of this up to localities to figure out . Cities , counties , and other areas would get a chance to apply for the program , and the Department of Labor would be required to pick a mix of urban and rural areas to try the idea out in . Once the program was up and running , the vast majority of jobs offered would be in the public sector , and participants who need more skills development would be offered up to eight weeks of training .\nPositions meeting \u201c a list of national job priorities \u2026 that shall include child care , care for seniors and individuals with disabilities , [ and ] infrastructure activities \u201d would be encouraged , and private sector employers would benefit from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit , a benefit which currently gives employers a few thousand dollars toward wages when they hire veterans , welfare or food stamp recipients , ex-felons , and other people with barriers to employment . But beyond that , the bill doesn \u2019 t give many specifics .\nA job guarantee would ideally provide for jobs that are nice to have but could be nixed when the economy improves and the program shrinks in size . Those are pretty hard to identify . If a job guarantee were enacted in a recession , and many of the enrollees became child care providers , what happens when the economy improves and workers find jobs in the private sector ? It wouldn \u2019 t be tenable to eliminate a universal child care program because the economy improved . Nor , if the program employed bus drivers , would it make much sense to cut bus routes .\nThe Booker bill requires that the program be subject to an ongoing rigorous evaluation , which would help determine how well-equipped local governments are to make those kinds of distinctions . That would be a welcome addition to the research literature , as there \u2019 s some past evidence suggesting programs like this struggle to succeed . Berkeley economist David Card recently conducted a meta-analysis of more than 200 evaluations of programs meant to boost labor markets , along with fellow economists Jochen Kluve and Andrea Weber . While they found a variety of impacts of different programs , one constant was that public employment programs that simply hired people directly performed worst .\n\u201c Public sector employment subsidies tend to have negligible or even negative impacts at all horizons , \u201d the study concludes . \u201c This pattern suggests that private employers place little value on the experiences gained in a public sector program. \u201d One reason , they suggested , was that the programs did nothing to help build skills that would make participants more employable .\nA job guarantee , though , would be on an entirely different scale , and the Booker bill would enable an evaluation that could determine if its effects are more like the successful Indian program or the failed efforts that Card , Kluve , and Weber studied .\nWith Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans in charge of both houses of Congress , it \u2019 s doubtful Booker \u2019 s bill will become law anytime soon . But that \u2019 s not really the point . Until his proposal , the closest thing there was to a job guarantee bill in Congress was Rep. John Conyers \u2019 s ( D-MI ) Humphrey-Hawkins 21st Century Full Employment and Training Act , named after a largely failed 1970s bill pushed by civil rights activists and unions to enact a job guarantee . But the bill fell short of establishing a formal guarantee , and Conyers has since resigned from Congress in a sexual harassment scandal .\nBooker has put the idea back on the Democratic agenda , and in a form that could be readily passed at relatively minimal cost ( given the pilot program nature ) when Democrats are next in power . That \u2019 s an important step , and one that significantly improves the odds that the idea will be part of the next Democratic president \u2019 s to-do list .",
