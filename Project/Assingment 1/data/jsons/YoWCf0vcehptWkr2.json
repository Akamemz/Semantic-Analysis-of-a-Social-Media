In fact , several of the companies cited on the new site said the Republican characterizations of their activities were far from accurate .\nAccording to the Republican committee , ABB Inc. , a global energy and technology company , \u201c received over $ 16 million in stimulus funds to create green energy manufacturing jobs \u201d and has \u201c laid off workers in the U.S. and transferred work to Mexico . \u201d\n\u201c That sounds like somebody taking facts and just twisting them , \u201d said Barry Dillon , the spokesman for ABB , based in North Carolina .
