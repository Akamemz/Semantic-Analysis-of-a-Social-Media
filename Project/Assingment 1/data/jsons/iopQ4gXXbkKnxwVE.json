    "content": "When President George W. Bush asked the American people , back in 2000 , `` Is our children learning ? '' left-leaning people everywhere got a big hoot out of it . Little did they know that the joke was on them .\nThe question not only revealed the inability of our national leaders to manage something as basic as English grammar . It reflected the incoherent means to which American education policy , with the support of Democrats and Republicans alike , would ultimately go about attempting to assess the impact of the country 's entire schooling enterprise .\nBeginning with No Child Left Behind in 2001 , an elaborate scheme to answer the question , `` Is our children learning , '' rolled out wave after wave of various assessments across every state in the country .\nResults from national diagnostic tests , such as the National Assessment of Education Progress ( NAEP ) , which had previously never made much of a splash outside of academic circles , suddenly became throat-clutching events anticipated with days of media buildup .\nResults from obscure international assessments \u2013 Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) , Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ( PIRLS ) \u2013 suddenly became crucially important `` data '' for determining the nation 's potential prosperity .\nThe results of all these exams have now become fodder for nearly every politician and government official to make grandiose claims that their campaign or their administration is `` for the kids . ''\nEconomists use the test results to build elaborate spreadsheets to justify all sorts of pronouncements about `` what works '' in education . And a parade of Very Serious People in news shows and symposiums obsess over pinhead arguments based on testing `` output . ''\nAre all these assessments useless ? Of course not . As a diagnostic tool , each may or may not reveal something worthwhile .\nAs University of Virginia professor Daniel Willingham recently observed , `` Just as body temperature is a reliable , partial indicator of certain types of disease , a test score is a reliable , partial indicator of certain types of school outcomes . ''\nBut that 's not how the assessment results are being talked about in the media or how they 're being used to leverage policy and change .\nNow , hardly a week goes by when another data dump from testing of some kind does n't send Americans scrambling to see how our country , state , city , school or child is doing academically .\nLast month , the most recent results from the NAEP provoked an array of media types \u2013 from `` reform '' enthusiasts like Michelle Rhee to all-purpose pundits like Nicholas Kristof \u2013 to make huge rhetorical overreaches using NAEP results to advance their opinions .\nThis week , the latest round of PISA results came across the transom , and a media feeding frenzy ensued .\n`` U.S. Test Scores Remain Stagnant '' rang the alarm from the education writer at the Huffington Post . The headline at U.S. News and World Report exclaimed , `` American Students Fall in International Academic Tests , Chinese Lead the Pack . '' ( Note to USN editor : The `` Chinese '' in the case of PISA are students from one city only , Shanghai , which represents an insignificant sample of the Chinese national population . )\nSecretary of Education Arne Duncan took the release of the PISA scores as an opportunity to use the resources from his own department , funded by the American taxpayer , to choreograph a mostly negative P.R . campaign aimed at public schools and educators .\nThe point of Duncan 's campaign was to use `` stagnating '' PISA scores to spur urgency for a political agenda . He worked with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , which conducts the PISA , and other groups to stage PISA Day , a media event that spent most of five hours ( ! ) arguing that the PISA scores were reasons to get behind policies that have been branded as `` reform . ''\nAt one point in the discussion , moderator Amanda Ripley noted that none of the top scoring nations from the PISA were particularly keen on ideas the Duncan platform espouses , such as using student test sores in teacher evaluations and promoting more charter schools as a competitive parallel school system .\nDuncan replied with anything but a straightforward response , hauling out familiar talking points about the need for `` accountability for student learning . ''\nHas anything from PISA caused you to question what you 've been promoting , Ripley asked ? Duncan replied with more bromides about the need to `` raise standards , '' yet another conclusion in no way supported by PISA ( or any other research for that matter ) .\nMichelle Rhee took to the pages of Time to use the PISA scores as an opportunity to scold Americans about settling for `` mediocrity . ''\n`` America needs to hit bottom \u2013 34th out of 34 \u2013 before we \u2019 ll truly embrace reform , '' Rhee suggested \u2013 `` reform '' being , of course , the policies she helped implement in Tennessee and Washington , D.C .\nShe claimed , `` The countries that are excelling academically are doing similar things . Setting high standards for all students . Investing in teacher effectiveness . Ensuring accountability at every level . '' None of which is true .\nBy `` standards \u2026 effectiveness \u2026 accountability , '' what Rhee means , of course , is more emphasis on her reform agenda of assessing schools , teachers and students with high-stakes test scores \u2013 not at all an agenda uniformly accepted by top-scoring nations .\nFinnish educator Pasi Sahlberg corrected her on a blog site at the Washington Post , noting that Finland 's PISA scores are routinely at or near the top , yet `` the Finnish approach to educational policy has stood in direct opposition to the path embraced by the United States . ''\nAt the Atlantic , Jordan Weissman observed , `` U.S. teens have tended to botch these sorts of tests ever since the 1960s \u2026 Which raises a question : If we 've been so bad at these tests for so long , why worry now ? In the last 30 years , our growth has n't lagged other developed countries . Our allegedly underdeveloped American minds still managed to build the Internet . ''\nIndeed , Weissmann noted , `` Some have gone so far as to suggest that an over-emphasis on test-taking could harm an economy . ''\nYet , `` none of this is to say we should entirely ignore assessments like PISA , '' Weissmann concluded .\nLike Dan Willingham 's analogy to a thermometer , standardized tests of any kind \u2013 from international assessments to end of year exams for individual students \u2013 can be useful diagnostic tools for uncovering more `` serious issues '' than mere rankings .\nRegarding PISA , for instance , virtually no one commenting about what the tests may have revealed , other than Dana Goldstein at Slate , bothered to look at what 's actually on the test .\nSimilarly , standardized tests given in American schools are implemented in a way that provides absolutely nothing diagnostically significant to the people whom the tests affect most . Schools are not privy to the exam questions , teachers do n't get to see the results until months after the test was given ( indeed , often after the students are no longer in their classes ) , and parents and students get no significant feedback other than raw scores with peer or grade level comparisons .\nWhen it comes to the way the media talk about tests and how policy leaders use test results in decisions , nothing beyond mere ranking and spin ever seems to enter the discussion .\nIn fact , the whole question of how test data of any kind fits into the policy-making process has a $ 1 trillion answer .\nLast month , global consulting business McKinsey & Co. published a report concluding that the market for data in education from both public and private sources represented a new business venture worth between $ 900 billion and $ 1.2 trillion in annual economic value worldwide , about a third of it in the United States .\nAs reported in Education Week , the report contends that more `` open and transparent '' data on students ' academic performance and backgrounds would lead to multiple advantages \u2013 including improved instruction , more efficient administration , and better `` matching '' of students to higher education and employment \u2013 that represent billions of dollars in `` added economic value in education . ''\nOne such system has indeed already rolled out , called inBloom , with the blessings and support of the U.S. Department of Education and the financial backing of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .\nAlready , inBloom has created enough concerns among parents to cause school districts in Colorado and Chicago to dump their contracts and pushed parents in New York City to file a lawsuit .\nWho provides the `` value '' in such a data system , undoubtedly , are the students themselves who have their personal and demographic information loaded into the system and their test results constantly open to the scrutiny of others .\nBut who reaps the value of such an arrangement is not well understood . Once students ' academic information becomes essentially available , it 's not at all hard to imagine it becoming the subject of financial speculation at any scale .\nIn fact , a recent blog post , again at Education Week , by an analyst for an education venture fund explained exactly how that sort of speculation would work at the individual student level . `` Why ca n't I invest in 20 % of the future earnings of a first-year Harvard Law student ? '' he asked . `` Now what about the high school junior from Hunts Point that works two jobs to help pay rent that just got an 800 on her Math SAT ? \u2026 And the nine-year old from Odessa that just aced the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness ( STAAR\u00ae ) Reading section ? ''\nOf course the answers to these `` why ca n't '' questions are obvious : Because what if the investor suddenly decides to pull out or sell the shares to someone else ? And what about all those students who are n't such attractive `` investment targets '' ?\nBut the main point is that the market for test scores has in effect turned student learning \u2013 and by extension , the students themselves \u2013 into a commodity . This makes test scores the ends in and of themselves for speculation of all kinds \u2013 whether from media bloviating or on the floor of trading houses on Wall Street .\nFurther , test data feed decision making among policymakers intent on using an economic model rather than an academic one to determine policy .\nTraditionally , the \u201c value \u201d of education has been calculated in terms of what it means to a child \u2019 s personal well-being and the future of the country . But shortsighted policymakers have decided they want a value proposition that shows payout in the here and now .\nWith the costs of education \u2013 mostly physical plant and personnel \u2013 entered on one side of the balance sheet , business-minded policy leaders need \u201c revenue \u201d to show on the other side .\nSo `` reform advocates '' decreed that student scores on standardized tests would define the learning \u201c output \u201d that schools would be accountable for . And all of a sudden everything monetarily related to schools \u2013 operations budgets , teacher salaries , classroom costs , government funds , grant money \u2013 could be related to a test score output .\nNow standardized test scores are the \u201c currency \u201d of education that enables all sorts of resource swaps that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago .\nWith something on the revenue side of the balance sheet ( test scores ) , venture capitalists can \u201c flip \u201d student test scores into a speculative market . And all sorts of \u201c reform \u201d schemes and start-ups \u2013 from starting charter schools to lowering teacher salaries to closing schools \u2013 could be rationalized on the basis of test scores .\nWhat get lost in this whole lousy scheme are the goal of real learning and the authentic purpose of education .\nBack to Dan Willingham , in another post , who said the purpose of education is to change the world , `` to make it more similar to some ideal that we envision . ''\nThus , education `` must entail values , because it entails selecting goals . '' ( his emphasis )\n`` We want to change the world \u2013 we want kids to learn things \u2013 facts , skills , values . Well , which ones ? ''\nRight now , governed by an `` Is Our Children Learning '' policy , the answer to that question is unlikely to be found in the next test results .",
