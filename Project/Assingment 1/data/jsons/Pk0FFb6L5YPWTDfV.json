    "content": "President Obama said Wednesday that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a `` game-changer '' that would demand action from the international community , though he stressed that the U.S. and other nations are still trying to determine whether those weapons were used .\nThe president addressed the issue during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , on his first visit to Israel as commander-in-chief . Syria , as well as Iran , were at the top of the agenda in a meeting between the two leaders earlier in the day .\nAsked about allegations that chemical weapons have been used in Syria , Obama stressed that `` we have to make sure that we know exactly what happened . ''\nOnce the facts are established , Obama said , `` I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game-changer . ''\nHe said the use of those weapons would create an even more `` horrific scene '' in Syria -- and the `` international community has to act on that additional information . ''\nAny confirmation that the Assad regime used the weapons would put pressure on the Obama administration to follow through on warnings that such an act would constitute crossing a `` red line . '' Syrian rebels and Assad 's regime on Tuesday accused each other of using those weapons , though Obama said he is `` deeply skeptical of any claim '' that the opposition was behind that kind of attack .\nOfficials from the U.S. and Israel , though , were sending conflicting signals Wednesday about the potential evidence supporting such an attack .\nShortly before Obama spoke , U.S . Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said during testimony on Capitol Hill that \u201c so far we have no evidence to substantiate those reports . ''\n\u201c I want to underline that we are looking very carefully , '' Ford said .\nHis comments before the House Foreign Affairs Committee were made within hours of Yuval Steinitz , Israel \u2019 s new minister of intelligence and strategic affairs , saying in an interview the weapons were used . However , he would not say how he reached the conclusion or which side used them .\n`` It is apparently clear that chemical weapons were used , '' he said . `` The fact they apparently used chemical weapons against civilians needs to worry us and shows the urgency of taking care of the issue . ''\nSteinitz said that after Iran 's nuclear program , the fate of Syria 's chemical weapons is the second most urgent issue that will be discussed with Obama during his 48-hour visit .\nThere have been many reports and rumors of such weapons being used throughout the war but no attack has yet been confirmed . Israel has repeatedly expressed concern that Syria 's chemical arsenal could fall into the hands of anti-Israel militants like Lebanon 's Hezbollah , an Assad ally , or an Al Qaeda-linked group fighting with the rebels .\nMore than 70,000 civilians have been killed in the attempt to overthrow Assad , and an estimated 1 billion others have fled to neighboring countries , including roughly 450,000 to Jordan .\nFord also testified that the U.S. continues to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid . However , the administration maintains a policy of trying to negotiate a peace settlement and not providing weapons to opposition forces .\nHe also declined to answer questions about what would be the consequence should U.S. officials find Syria crossed a \u201c red line \u201d by using chemical weapons .\nObama has declared the use , deployment or transfer of the weapons would be a red line for possible U.S. military intervention .\n\u201c I am certain they have been discussed but I do n't want to speculate , \u201d Ford said . \u201c I do n't want to go there . ''\nThe Syrian state-run SANA news agency said Tuesday `` a missile containing a chemical substance '' was fired at the village by `` terrorists '' -- the term it uses for rebels .
