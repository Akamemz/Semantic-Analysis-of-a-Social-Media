He was completely un-phased by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves. \u201d Finch ran into the ocean and finally scooped up the piglet bringing him back to shore .

In the Deep South, that will mean no more Democrats in the US Senate, a governor\u2019s office, or the majority in a state legislature. This shift to deep red in the Deep South has been decades in the making. And it was only a matter of time before Louisiana was going to shift, too, analysts say. Still, one statistic stood out in Senator Landrieu\u2019s vote totals on Election Day last month: She got only 18 percent of the white vote, down from 33 percent just six years ago Why the precipitous decline? And what does it signal for Democrats\u2019 future chances in the South? To the first question, experts on Southern policies have a short answer: President Obama\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nDEMS DRAFT MIDTERM AUTOPSY TEAM\n\nAP: \u201cDemocrats are turning to Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and others to lead a task force reviewing what went wrong in recent mid-term elections. The Democratic National Committee is naming a 10-person panel to examine the party's problems during the 2014 and 2010 elections and recommend solutions. The task force is aiming to determine why Democrats have struggled to turn out its voters in non-presidential elections. It will look at the party's tactics, messaging, get-out-the-vote operations and digital efforts. It expects to complete its work by mid-2015.\u201d\n\n\n\nWRONG TURN ON THE WAY TO THE MARKET\n\nA piglet near Suffolk, England apparently went to great lengths to escape his pen. The adventurous little oinker first slithered under an electric wire fence, crossing 200 yards of farmland to the end of a cliff where he got stuck in the sand. Animal inspector Jason Finch was called by a passer-by to help rescue the piglet. Panicking by the attempted human capture, the animal fell off the cliff and started swimming out in the ocean. Finch said, \u201cI have never seen anything like it. I couldn't believe it when he darted straight into the sea like that. He was completely un-phased by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves.\u201d Finch ran into the ocean and finally scooped up the piglet bringing him back to shore. Though after the successful rescue, he was unable to report if this little piggy cried \u201cwee, wee, wee\u201d all the way home to the relieved staff at Church Farm.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cI think anybody who looks at the [Eric Garner] video would think, that this was the wrong judgment, the problem is in our system, you don\u2019t have double jeopardy. If a grand jury makes a mistake, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d \u2014Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
