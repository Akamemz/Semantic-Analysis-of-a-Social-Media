    "content": "Christine Blasey Ford has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , who will also take questions from the senators about the matter .\nKavanaugh strongly denies committing the assault , and will submit his calendar from the summer of 1982 as evidence that he never attended a house party with Ford and the other people she has claimed were there . On Saturday , a long-time friend of Ford , Leland Ingham Keyser , lent some credence to Kavanaugh 's denial : Contrary to Ford 's claim that Keyser attended the party 35 years ago , Keyeser said she never met Kavanaugh and was not present at any such party .\n`` Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present , with , or without , Dr. Ford , '' said Keyser 's lawyer in a statement , according to CNN .\nIt 's possible , of course , that she did meet Kavanaugh , and was there on the day of the sexual assault\u2014she just ca n't remember . Even so , the fact that no relevant witness has been willing or able to back up Ford 's eminently plausible but unproven account is notable .\nWhen it comes to the truth of the accusation , I can understand why people might have a hunch one way ( evidence of a pattern of alcohol abuse among Kavanaugh 's social circle , lack of unbelievable details in accusation ) , or the other ( no other accusers , extensive testimony of Kavanaugh 's good treatment of women ) . But plenty of political experts sound as if they are already certain of Kavanaugh 's guilt or innocence .\nWhat 's more , some of these people sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2014the very authority charged with deciding whether the allegation is credible enough to deny Kavanaugh a spot on the Supreme Court . This should serve as a reminder that despite all the conservative defenders of Kavanaugh invoking due process , Kavanaugh is not actually entitled to it . If he was , most members of the Senate Judiciary Committee would have to recuse themselves from the vote , since they have made prejudicial statements about Kavanaugh that signal their lack of impartiality .\nTake Sen. Mazie Hirono ( D\u2013Hi . ) , who told Jake Tapper that she put Kavanaugh 's denial `` in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases . '' She described Kavanaugh as `` very outcome driven '' and having `` an ideological agenda , '' and appeared to suggest that his hostility toward abortion rights somehow gave credence to Ford 's accusation .
