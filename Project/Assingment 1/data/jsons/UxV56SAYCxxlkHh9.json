No , he \u2019 ll tell us about how disarming ourselves will somehow keep us safer from terrorists the government allows into the country , fails to police , and can \u2019 t respond to quickly enough .\nI \u2019 m Sorry . President Obama has spent his entire presidency downplaying the threat of radical Islamic terrorism for his own political gain . Last week , Obama \u2019 s former head of intelligence admitted on national television that Obama ignored intelligence about the rise of ISIS in order to win re-election in 2012 . On the day before ISIS attacked Paris , killing 130 people , Obama said , \u201c We have contained them. \u201d On the day of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino , Obama said , \u201c The American people should feel confident that , you know , we are going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that , you know , we have a good holiday and go about our lives. \u201d He said that at the same exact time that Tashfeen Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS . Obama should be apologizing to all of us for his failures to take seriously Islamic terrorism so that he can focus on his domestic agenda .\nIf You See Something , Say Something . We now know that a neighbor of Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik saw suspicious activity . He didn \u2019 t call the police for fear of being castigated for racial profiling . President Obama should be telling us all to be on the lookout for suspicious activity . Instead , he has sent out his Attorney General to warn us all about speaking negatively about Islam , and to investigate the Irving Police Department for properly responding to reports of a Muslim teenager , Clock Boy Ahmed Mohammed , carrying a bomb-like object into a school .\nLet \u2019 s Take It Easy On The Immigration . Tashfeen Malik got into the country on a K-1 visa . She had to pass a background check in order to do so . On her papers , she wrote an address in Pakistan that didn \u2019 t exist . Obviously , nothing happened . President Obama keeps telling us that we must take in tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees it will be impossible to vet . That has to stop .\nWe Must Rebuild Our Military . Obviously we don \u2019 t have the resources to fight ISIS properly . If we did , we would be doing it \u2013 unless this is a failure of will rather than material . Either way , it \u2019 s Obama \u2019 s fault .

It \u2019 s also true that those terrorists would have gotten illegal weapons regardless of the law , considering they had 15 pipe bombs . A roomful of well-armed Americans would certainly have posed more of a threat to the terrorists than a room full of unarmed people .
