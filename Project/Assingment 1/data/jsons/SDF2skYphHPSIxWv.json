    "content": "FORT BENNING , GA. \u2014 At first glance , the scene unfolding here in the rolling Georgia woodlands would appear to be unremarkable .\nTwo-by-two , bellies in the dirt and hands behind their backs , buddy teams of soldiers with shaved heads snake across the ground under the eye of the attentive instructors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an obstacle course \u2013 have some fun ! \u201d yells another to exhausted soldiers ordered to crab-walk to the evocatively-named \u201c Belly Buster , \u201d a station that involves running headlong into a stomach-high moving log .\nIt would seem to be a snapshot like any other in the 63-year history of the Army \u2019 s elite Ranger School . Except for one thing : For the first time ever , some of these buzz-cut soldiers are women .\nYou have to look closely to notice . The men have a little less hair , perhaps \u2013 their heads were shaved completely as incoming Ranger students . Some of the women wanted to do the same , but the Army decided it would be \u201c too GI Jane , \u201d as one official puts it .\nNow that the men \u2019 s bald cuts have grown in , \u201c I don \u2019 t even know who I \u2019 m yelling at , \u201d says one instructor .\nIt is high praise for the women , who arrived at Ranger School amid criticism that has been quiet but steady : They can \u2019 t make the cut . They won \u2019 t fit in . They will lower the standards of the storied Rangers .\nOne week into the 62-day course , none of these dire predictions has come to pass .\nThe challenge for those who remain is stark , however . Between January and April , 113 women tried to qualify for Ranger School , but only 20 did . Of the 19 women who started the course \u2013 one had to drop out before school began \u2013 eight are still in the running one week later . ( By comparison , 197 of the 381 men were dropped the first week . )\nBut this historic step has always been about more than just producing the first female Ranger this year . In fact , any women who pass this course won \u2019 t be allowed to serve as Rangers , since the ban on women in combat remains in effect until January 2016 , when services must lift it or offer a compelling reason why they can not .\nBut women who succeed will earn the prestigious Ranger tab as well as the respect and , perhaps ultimately , the opportunity that accompanies it . For this reason , the course is being closely watched by Pentagon brass .\nWhat they \u2019 ve seen has encouraged them . The women here are coming up with creative ways not only to match the men \u2019 s physical strength but also how to get changed in the woods without freaking out the guys . They \u2019 re showing they can fight and use their past war experience to fit in at the legendary training ground for the Army \u2019 s special operations force , officials say .\n\u201c I \u2019 d be glad to serve with them on the battlefield anywhere , anytime , \u201d says Brig . Gen. James Rainey , a Ranger who commanded a battalion in the Battle of Fallujah , and is now the Infantry School Commandant . \u201c They \u2019 re phenomenal soldiers . \u201d\nWhether the women who remain \u2013 with backgrounds as varied as an Apache helicopter pilot and a reservist with two young children \u2013 make it to the end of the course remains to be seen .\nBut they are well-positioned , senior military officials here say , to become part of the elite 3 percent of Army service members who have earned the right to call one another Ranger .\nOn a sunny late-April day , the scent of blackberry and honeysuckle in the breeze blowing through the canopy of Georgia long leaf pines , the aspiring Rangers sound off cadences :\nThe course is less than one mile long straight through , but it generally takes students the better part of two hours to complete the 26 obstacles in it . During this time they will be pushed to their physical limits .\nAs they perform over the next two months , they will be appraised not only by instructors here , but by their fellow soldiers , too .\nIt \u2019 s a crucial part of Ranger School , which requires not only outstanding and sustained physical stamina , but also positive peer feedback \u2013 as measured by narrative comments that Ranger students must complete .\nIt \u2019 s one way the Army can weed out what are known here as \u201c spotlight Rangers , \u201d who shine when leaders are watching and slack off when they aren \u2019 t .\nThese narrative comments tend to be solicited when Ranger students are exhausted and hungry , and they don \u2019 t pull punches .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t trust this guy to water my cactus , \u201d one Ranger recently wrote . \u201c He steals food , \u201d was another bit of feedback .\nAs the women make their way through the course today , they garner subtle nods in their direction from top Rangers tracking their performance .\n\u201c She \u2019 s one to watch , \u201d says a male observer , signaling in the direction of one female contender .\n\u201c She \u2019 s smoking it , \u201d another Ranger adds , referring to a second female student \u2019 s performance .\nCol. David Fivecoat , commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade and a Ranger who has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan , arrived here at the Camp Darby Queen course early , to run it himself before observing the students this morning .\nThe paint on the obstacles is new and the previous night \u2019 s downpour has made them slick .\nHe is standing beside the brigade \u2019 s command sergeant major , Curtis Arnold Jr. , a lanky redhead with a thick Southern twang who has held every infantry position in the Army , from rifleman on up . He has four tours to Iraq and Afghanistan under his belt .\nTogether , they are connoisseurs of technique , always on the lookout for novel ways that students here are able to surmount the obstacles within the rough parameters provided to them .\nArnold tells Fivecoat that he has spotted a new one today , as he demonstrates a reverse-arm monkey bar grip used by one of the female students . Fivecoat agrees it is a solid innovation .\nAdapting is key for all students , officials here say . \u201c You may not be able to hump the extra weight because you \u2019 re a small person , but if you can do a great job planning , or going to get the water , or if you \u2019 re seen as value-added \u2013 that \u2019 s how you do well in peers , \u201d Fivecoat says .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got to figure out what you \u2019 re good at , \u201d Arnold adds , \u201c and you \u2019 ve got to make that known . \u201d\nMany of the women here have deployment experience and , in part because of that , have scored highly among their peers in operations planning , says Capt . Katie Fichtner .\nA West Point graduate , Fichtner is a field artillery specialist , the first-ever female fires platoon leader in her home battalion . With a passion for trajectories and the math that accompanies them , she has become the school \u2019 s de facto statistics guru .\nShe is also one of 31 women brought in to be observer advisers , or OAs , for the female Ranger students .\nSince pre-training began , the OAs have been called upon to weigh in on matters that men who had never deployed with women seem to \u201c fixate \u201d on , they say , like bathroom logistics and changing .\nIt is a source of great amusement to the women . \u201c Men seem to have this mythical idea that women need to shower every three days , \u201d Fichtner says , recalling a time she was tapped out in the field during artillery training to shower .\n\u201c I asked , \u2018 Do my [ male ] soldiers get to shower , too ? \u2019 \u201d When she was told no , she turned down the offer . It took a perusal of the regulations handbook for her male superiors back then to agree to accept her refusal .\nWhen it came to changing , since the Rangers are living and sleeping together out in the field , the OAs suggested that women could throw on a rain poncho \u2013 part of every Ranger \u2019 s kit \u2013 or simply wear a sports bra .\nThen there was the slight tussle over birth-control pills . Ranger School regulations say that students can \u2019 t take any medication with them into the field .\n\u201c It was idiotic , \u201d says Arnold of the howls of protest that came from places like Facebook saying standards were being compromised .\nThe women were ultimately allowed to take the pills into the field . This means , Arnold notes , that they have to carry \u201c an extra two ounces , \u201d which should earn them more respect for their heavier load , he jokes .\nAs some soldiers duck-walk to the next obstacle , knees grazing pine needles and thighs no doubt burning , others are told to leap over a thick log about four feet high before tucking head-first into a combat roll \u2013 without use of their hands and without touching the log , either .\nIt is a task that about 1 in 3 of the soldiers who have been passing by are failing to accomplish .\nNext up is a female soldier , who digs deep , leaps , and lands hard on her back . \u201c Do not touch my beam ! \u201d the instructor yells .\nShe dusts herself off and tries again . ( All students get three chances . )\nThis time , her fellow Rangers cheer her on . \u201c Jump higher ! \u201d one yells .\nShe appears to take this under advisement , but grazes the log each time as she lands twice more with a thud . She gets the standard \u201c spot report \u201d for failing an obstacle , just like the soldiers before her .\nStill , Arnold is impressed by the cheers of her fellow Ranger students . \u201c That \u2019 s good , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s really good. \u201d Some of the Ranger School classes fail to jell , for whatever reason , he says .\n\u201c All the classes have different dynamics , \u201d Fivecoat adds . This group appears to be tight .\nAs he observes the field of soldiers on the course before him , Arnold is reminded of his 8-year-old daughter . He teaches her to maneuver on her older brothers using a Nerf gun , and she tells her dad that she wants to be in the Army , just like him . \u201c She \u2019 s really smart , \u201d he says . \u201c She could do this . \u201d\nOne of the reasons that women have managed to fit in at the school is that they \u2019 ve learned skills during their war deployments that make them \u201c value added , \u201d as they say here .\nAs an infantry battalion commander in Afghanistan in 2010 , for example , Fivecoat sent two women down to each company to make sure the units could better do their job .\nThe female soldiers \u201c had the ability to talk to women when we couldn \u2019 t , \u201d he says , adding that they also came back with \u201c atmospherics \u201d \u2013 Army parlance for intelligence \u2013 \u201c that were very helpful . \u201d\nStaff Sgt . Cynthia Velarde , an OA from Fort Bliss , Texas , has seen the situation from the other side .\nStanding at 5 feet , 1 inch with the closely-cropped haircut of the aspiring female Rangers , Velarde has an easy smile and a passion for athletics \u2013 her father , a United States Navy veteran who played on the Bolivian national soccer team , was her coach growing up .\nShe also deployed to Afghanistan with Rangers as part of a Female Engagement Team and frequently went on patrols with soldiers in scout and mortar platoons .\nIt took some time for them to accept women in their ranks . \u201c At first , the guys looked at us as , \u2018 Great , extra baggage . \u2019 \u201d\nShe recalls the first time she met up with some of the infantrymen in her new unit to work out . \u201c We all knew , \u2018 This is it. \u2019 They were going to try to kill us , physically , to see if we could hang . \u201d\nShe went out hard with the fast group of men . \u201c I don \u2019 t think they were expecting that , \u201d she says . She kept up for a mile .\n\u201c After that it was a dead sprint for them . There was no way , \u201d she says , smiling as she shakes her head . She couldn \u2019 t keep up , but she didn \u2019 t stop running , either . \u201c I was hurting , but I wasn \u2019 t going to quit . \u201d\nAs the end of her deployment in Afghanistan neared , the company commander sat her down . \u201c He was like , \u2018 I would take you over any guy , any day on a deployment . I really hope that if they ever open up Ranger School that you do it . \u201d\nWhen the female Ranger training program was announced last year , the phone calls and e-mails started coming in from other Rangers who knew her , urging her to apply . \u201c It was very humbling for me , \u201d she says .\nShe debated signing up as a student or as an OA . She decided on the latter , because she wanted to help shape the program .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t look at this as a career opportunity , \u201d she says . \u201c I wanted to look at it as this will eventually pave the way for females coming through . \u201d\nVelarde has offered particular reassurance on the hairstyle front . She buzz-cut hers in Afghanistan and never looked back . \u201c Sand kept getting stuck in there , \u201d she says , shrugging .\nHaving women in their ranks has helped ease the concerns of the men , says 1st Sgt . Daniel Moss , a brawny Ranger instructor who appears to have come straight out of central casting .\n\u201c Things that males might be hesitant towards , \u201d he says . \u201c A lot of the female advisers have been in situations where they were integrated . They were kind of the ones to be like , \u2018 Hey , you don \u2019 t need to worry about this \u2013 we can do this easier than you guys are planning . \u2019 \u201d\nHe cites a funnel-like device that makes it easier for women to use the bathroom standing up in the middle of patrols , say , without removing heavy packs or squatting down with them , which would be particularly hard on the knees .\n\u201c The OAs said we can use those successfully , \u201d Moss says , adding with a touch of wonder that this has indeed been the case . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t single females out at all . \u201d\nMost important , he says , \u201c They \u2019 ve been the ones who have helped make sure we haven \u2019 t changed any standards . \u201d\nHolding the line on standards at the storied school has been the mantra here . The school is one of the toughest in the US military . Only 20 percent of men who attempt it make it through the first time , and the ones who keep at it often require two or three tries .\nMaj. Gen. Scott Miller , the commander of the Maneuver Center of Excellence here , was raised in the Special Operations Forces \u2019 tough mystique .\n\u201c We said up front that the standards won \u2019 t change \u2013 and they haven \u2019 t , \u201d says Miller , a former commander in Delta Force , the Army \u2019 s covert counterterrorism unit , and a veteran of the Battle of Mogadishu , popularized in \u201c Black Hawk Down. \u201d \u201c Ranger School is the toughest mentally and physically \u2013 the most demanding course in the US Army . \u201d\nThat is clear to the students here , where the weight of the school \u2019 s history , with its reputation for superior leadership training , is a constant presence , Velarde says .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going into a tradition that dates back many years , \u201d she notes . \u201c Obviously there are going to be some people not on board with the idea . \u201d\nBut in practice , instructors and observers say , the transition has been surprisingly smooth .\nSome of the Ranger instructors were \u201c standoff-ish \u201d for the first week or so that the observers came in back in January , when the first training courses were held .\nNow , Velarde says , \u201c I don \u2019 t think there is any way that we all don \u2019 t feel like this is the right thing to do . \u201d\nRanger instructors have told her they \u2019 ve been impressed to see how well they \u2019 re actually doing .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of neat to hear them saying , \u2018 She \u2019 s one to look out for , \u2019 \u201d Velarde says . \u201c You can \u2019 t help but be proud . \u201d\nIf this grand experiment results in the Pentagon making the decision to open Ranger School to women permanently , Velarde says she will be the first to sign up .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c Honestly , they integrated well \u2013 they just blend in , \u201d says Moss , the Ranger instructor . \u201c I \u2019 d say I was even more pleased than I thought we \u2019 d be . \u201d\nAs Velarde walks by , he calls to her . \u201c There \u2019 s one of our OA \u2019 s now , \u201d he says . \u201c She \u2019 s crushing it . \u201d",

Check out a special Facebook chat with Pentagon correspondent Anna Mulrine on how views of women in the military are changing.\n\nFORT BENNING, GA. \u2014 At first glance, the scene unfolding here in the rolling Georgia woodlands would appear to be unremarkable.\n\nTwo-by-two, bellies in the dirt and hands behind their backs, buddy teams of soldiers with shaved heads snake across the ground under the eye of the attentive instructors.\n\n\u201cGet your face down, Ranger!\u201d one shouts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an obstacle course \u2013 have some fun!\u201d yells another to exhausted soldiers ordered to crab-walk to the evocatively-named \u201cBelly Buster,\u201d a station that involves running headlong into a stomach-high moving log.\n\nIt would seem to be a snapshot like any other in the 63-year history of the Army\u2019s elite Ranger School.

He has four tours to Iraq and Afghanistan under his belt.\n\nTogether, they are connoisseurs of technique, always on the lookout for novel ways that students here are able to surmount the obstacles within the rough parameters provided to them.\n\nArnold tells Fivecoat that he has spotted a new one today, as he demonstrates a reverse-arm monkey bar grip used by one of the female students. Fivecoat agrees it is a solid innovation.\n\nAdapting is key for all students, officials here say. \u201cYou may not be able to hump the extra weight because you\u2019re a small person, but if you can do a great job planning, or going to get the water, or if you\u2019re seen as value-added \u2013 that\u2019s how you do well in peers,\u201d Fivecoat says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to figure out what you\u2019re good at,\u201d Arnold adds, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to make that known.\u201d\n\nMany of the women here have deployment experience and, in part because of that, have scored highly among their peers in operations planning, says Capt. Katie Fichtner.\n\nA West Point graduate, Fichtner is a field artillery specialist, the first-ever female fires platoon leader in her home battalion. With a passion for trajectories and the math that accompanies them, she has become the school\u2019s de facto statistics guru.\n\nShe is also one of 31 women brought in to be observer advisers, or OAs, for the female Ranger students.\n\nSince pre-training began, the OAs have been called upon to weigh in on matters that men who had never deployed with women seem to \u201cfixate\u201d on, they say, like bathroom logistics and changing.\n\nIt is a source of great amusement to the women. \u201cMen seem to have this mythical idea that women need to shower every three days,\u201d Fichtner says, recalling a time she was tapped out in the field during artillery training to shower.\n\n\u201cI asked, \u2018Do my [male] soldiers get to shower, too?\u2019 \u201d When she was told no, she turned down the offer. It took a perusal of the regulations handbook for her male superiors back then to agree to accept her refusal.\n\nWhen it came to changing, since the Rangers are living and sleeping together out in the field, the OAs suggested that women could throw on a rain poncho \u2013 part of every Ranger\u2019s kit \u2013 or simply wear a sports bra.\n\nThen there was the slight tussle over birth-control pills. Ranger School regulations say that students can\u2019t take any medication with them into the field.\n\n\u201cIt was idiotic,\u201d says Arnold of the howls of protest that came from places like Facebook saying standards were being compromised.\n\nThe women were ultimately allowed to take the pills into the field.

(All students get three chances.)\n\nThis time, her fellow Rangers cheer her on. \u201cJump higher!\u201d one yells.\n\nShe appears to take this under advisement, but grazes the log each time as she lands twice more with a thud. She gets the standard \u201cspot report\u201d for failing an obstacle, just like the soldiers before her.\n\nStill, Arnold is impressed by the cheers of her fellow Ranger students. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d Some of the Ranger School classes fail to jell, for whatever reason, he says.\n\n\u201cAll the classes have different dynamics,\u201d Fivecoat adds. This group appears to be tight.\n\nAs he observes the field of soldiers on the course before him, Arnold is reminded of his 8-year-old daughter. He teaches her to maneuver on her older brothers using a Nerf gun, and she tells her dad that she wants to be in the Army, just like him. \u201cShe\u2019s really smart,\u201d he says. \u201cShe could do this.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons that women have managed to fit in at the school is that they\u2019ve learned skills during their war deployments that make them \u201cvalue added,\u201d as they say here.\n\nAs an infantry battalion commander in Afghanistan in 2010, for example, Fivecoat sent two women down to each company to make sure the units could better do their job.\n\nThe female soldiers \u201chad the ability to talk to women when we couldn\u2019t,\u201d he says, adding that they also came back with \u201catmospherics\u201d \u2013 Army parlance for intelligence \u2013 \u201cthat were very helpful.\u201d\n\nNo longer \u2018extra baggage\u2019\n\nStaff Sgt. Cynthia Velarde, an OA from Fort Bliss, Texas, has seen the situation from the other side.\n\nStanding at 5 feet, 1 inch with the closely-cropped haircut of the aspiring female Rangers, Velarde has an easy smile and a passion for athletics \u2013 her father, a United States Navy veteran who played on the Bolivian national soccer team, was her coach growing up.\n\nShe also deployed to Afghanistan with Rangers as part of a Female Engagement Team and frequently went on patrols with soldiers in scout and mortar platoons.\n\nIt took some time for them to accept women in their ranks. \u201cAt first, the guys looked at us as, \u2018Great, extra baggage.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe recalls the first time she met up with some of the infantrymen in her new unit to work out. \u201cWe all knew, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They were going to try to kill us, physically, to see if we could hang.\u201d\n\nShe went out hard with the fast group of men. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were expecting that,\u201d she says. She kept up for a mile.\n\n\u201cAfter that it was a dead sprint for them. There was no way,\u201d she says, smiling as she shakes her head. She couldn\u2019t keep up, but she didn\u2019t stop running, either. \u201cI was hurting, but I wasn\u2019t going to quit.\u201d\n\nAs the end of her deployment in Afghanistan neared, the company commander sat her down. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I would take you over any guy, any day on a deployment. I really hope that if they ever open up Ranger School that you do it.\u201d\n\nWhen the female Ranger training program was announced last year, the phone calls and e-mails started coming in from other Rangers who knew her, urging her to apply. \u201cIt was very humbling for me,\u201d she says.\n\nShe debated signing up as a student or as an OA. She decided on the latter, because she wanted to help shape the program.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t look at this as a career opportunity,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to look at it as this will eventually pave the way for females coming through.\u201d\n\nVelarde has offered particular reassurance on the hairstyle front. She buzz-cut hers in Afghanistan and never looked back. \u201cSand kept getting stuck in there,\u201d she says, shrugging.\n\nHaving women in their ranks has helped ease the concerns of the men, says 1st Sgt. Daniel Moss, a brawny Ranger instructor who appears to have come straight out of central casting.\n\n\u201cThings that males might be hesitant towards,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the female advisers have been in situations where they were integrated. They were kind of the ones to be like, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t need to worry about this \u2013 we can do this easier than you guys are planning.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe cites a funnel-like device that makes it easier for women to use the bathroom standing up in the middle of patrols, say, without removing heavy packs or squatting down with them, which would be particularly hard on the knees.\n\n\u201cThe OAs said we can use those successfully,\u201d Moss says, adding with a touch of wonder that this has indeed been the case. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t single females out at all.\u201d\n\nMost important, he says, \u201cThey\u2019ve been the ones who have helped make sure we haven\u2019t changed any standards.\u201d\n\nHolding the line\n\nHolding the line on standards at the storied school has been the mantra here. The school is one of the toughest in the US military. Only 20 percent of men who attempt it make it through the first time, and the ones who keep at it often require two or three tries.\n\nMaj. Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of the Maneuver Center of Excellence here, was raised in the Special Operations Forces\u2019 tough mystique.\n\n\u201cWe said up front that the standards won\u2019t change \u2013 and they haven\u2019t,\u201d says Miller, a former commander in Delta Force, the Army\u2019s covert counterterrorism unit, and a veteran of the Battle of Mogadishu, popularized in \u201cBlack Hawk Down.\u201d \u201cRanger School is the toughest mentally and physically \u2013 the most demanding course in the US Army.\u201d\n\nThat is clear to the students here, where the weight of the school\u2019s history, with its reputation for superior leadership training, is a constant presence, Velarde says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going into a tradition that dates back many years,\u201d she notes. \u201cObviously there are going to be some people not on board with the idea.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, instructors and observers say, the transition has been surprisingly smooth.\n\nSome of the Ranger instructors were \u201cstandoff-ish\u201d for the first week or so that the observers came in back in January, when the first training courses were held.\n\nNow, Velarde says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any way that we all don\u2019t feel like this is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nRanger instructors have told her they\u2019ve been impressed to see how well they\u2019re actually doing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of neat to hear them saying, \u2018She\u2019s one to look out for,\u2019 \u201d Velarde says. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but be proud.\u201d\n\nIf this grand experiment results in the Pentagon making the decision to open Ranger School to women permanently, Velarde says she will be the first to sign up.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
