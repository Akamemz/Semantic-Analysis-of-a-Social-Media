Put more bluntly , how could an avuncular white man who talks about consensus-building be whupping all 21 of his rivals at a time when liberals put such emphasis on freshness , diversity , and progressive ideals ?\nA full hour before Joe Biden is scheduled to speak at Manchester Community College , the only parking spaces left are way in the back of the lot , behind the welding shop . The neon letters on the school \u2019 s electronic sign trumpet through the darkness and drizzle : WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE JOE BIDEN .\nInside , the gymnasium is overflowing with checkered plaid shirts and fleece jackets , with teachers and geologists , bikers and firefighters , and people who drove an hour and a half from Republican enclaves where they don \u2019 t dare reveal their Democratic leanings .\nAs Mr. Biden steps up to the mic , ear-piercing whistles ricochet around the gym . \u201c You know in your gut , this is the most important election you \u2019 ve ever voted in , \u201d he tells the crowd .\nThree African American teenagers in the back zoom in on him with their smartphones . For these teens , it will be the first election they \u2019 ve ever voted in . And they can \u2019 t wait to cast ballots for the former vice president who served alongside Barack Obama .\n\u201c Being a person of color , I \u2019 d definitely like to see someone like Kamala Harris [ win ] . But there will be a time , \u201d says Layla Mohseni of Boston , who remembers watching President Obama \u2019 s inauguration when she was 7 , and still has an Obama-Biden sticker on her smartphone .\n\u201c I think [ Mr. Biden ] is the guy , \u201d she says simply , though adds that it would be \u201c ideal \u201d if Ms. Harris became his running mate , a suggestion that has been gaining momentum among some Democrats as a way to combine experience and freshness , continuity and diversity , electability and possibility .\nSince announcing his candidacy late last month , Mr. Biden has skyrocketed in the polls \u2013 to the surprise of Washington pundits , many of whom had predicted his first day on the trail might wind up being his best .\nHis front-runner status can be attributed in part to the strong support he \u2019 s getting from African American voters . But it \u2019 s not only that .\nChrista Case Bryant/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Munira Ahmed ( l. ) extends her hand to Joe Biden as Ayan Ahmed ( c. ) finishes a handshake after a campaign speech at Manchester Community College in New Hampshire . They drove up from Boston with Layla Mohseni ( center left ) , who remembers watching Barack Obama \u2019 s inauguration when she was 7 and is eager to cast her first vote for Mr. Biden .\nWhile it may have seemed that candidates like Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were pulling the Democrats inexorably to the left , Mr. Biden \u2019 s calls to unify a deeply divided country appear to be resonating with many voters whose No . 1 priority is ending what they see as a dangerous presidency that is corroding American democracy .\n\u201c One thing I like about Joe Biden is he has this red-blooded American , \u2018 badass grandpa \u2019 [ demeanor ] that might appeal to Trump voters who couldn \u2019 t bring themselves to vote for Hillary in 2016 , \u201d says Lisa Cot\u00e9 , an ACLU volunteer . Even though she personally has reservations about Mr. Biden , she says , \u201c It \u2019 s going to come down to people who didn \u2019 t vote or who regret voting for Trump . \u201d\nThe 2016 election came down to fewer than 80,000 votes in Wisconsin , Michigan , and Pennsylvania , where Donald Trump eked out razor-thin victories thanks in part to the support of blue-collar Democrats who surprised many by throwing in their lot with the New York billionaire .\nBefore Mr. Biden entered the race , skeptics wondered if there was any room left in the Democratic Party for someone like him \u2013 someone who \u2019 s been in Washington longer than Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been alive , with a long list of controversial positions in his past , from his opposition to busing in the \u2019 70s to his role chairing the Clarence Thomas hearings in the \u2019 90s . Even though he had been VP under the country \u2019 s first African American president , he was too middle of the road , too willing to work with Republicans , too out of touch with the woke millennial masses and the party \u2019 s progressive transformation . And yes , a bunch of people thought he was too touchy-feely to survive in the era of # MeToo .\nBut Mr. Biden \u2019 s rise in the polls over the past few weeks suggests they were wrong . He was already the most popular Democratic candidate when he entered the race on April 25 , but he has since more than tripled his margin of advantage over his closest competitor \u2013 Senator Sanders \u2013 from 4 points to 20 points , according to Morning Consult .\nThat likely reflects the fact that the party \u2019 s voters as a whole are not nearly as left-wing as its most activist standard-bearers . In a January poll , Democrats were offered a variety of labels and allowed to choose up to three . The most popular label ? \u201c Obama Democrat , \u201d with 25 % . Only 7 % chose Socialist or Democratic Socialist .\nMr. Biden , who grew up in Scranton , Pennsylvania , is banking on the votes not of liberal elites in Washington , but of average people who yearn not only for more comfortable financial circumstances but also a deeper sense of dignity and pride .\nBrian Snyder/Reuters Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden answers questions from reporters during a campaign stop at The Works in Concord , New Hampshire , May 14 .\nIn the Manchester gymnasium on Monday night , he starts to roar as he talks about restoring the working class in America .\n\u201c YOU BUILT THIS COUNTRY , \u201d he bellows . American workers are three times more productive than in Asia , he says . We have more great research universities and labs than any other country , and you own them \u2013 you pay taxes for them , says the former vice president , who once described the United States to China \u2019 s Xi Jinping in one word : possibilities .\n\u201c What are we doing ?

It \u2019 s Dick Swett , a former New Hampshire congressman and ambassador who sees in Mr. Biden a youthful enthusiasm that belies his age .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re going to win this election , we \u2019 ve got ta be enthusiastic , \u201d Mr. Swett says afterward . \u201c We need wisdom that comes with age , we need energy that comes with attitude , not just youth .\nMany voters who came out to see Mr. Biden brushed off concerns about the fact that if elected , he would be the oldest president ever inaugurated , at 78 years old .
