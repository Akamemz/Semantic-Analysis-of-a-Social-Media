    "content": "The most important moment of Sunday night 's Democratic presidential debate involved not what was said , but what moderator Lester Holt made sure his audience would never get to hear . After permitting Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to offer lengthy replies to a question on the drug epidemic , he cut off Martin O \u2019 Malley and moved to a commercial break despite the former Maryland governor repeatedly requesting \u201c just 10 seconds \u201d in which to offer his own thoughts .\nThis was more than just an act of brazen unfairness toward O \u2019 Malley . Since the start of the 2016 election cycle , both major parties have been swept up in a \u201c horse race \u201d mentality regarding their respective fields of presidential prospects . If a candidate isn \u2019 t believed to have a viable shot at winning their party \u2019 s nomination , he or she is openly dismissed shuffled into the background so that their \u201c electable \u201d counterparts can receive disproportionate attention . As a result , underdogs like O \u2019 Malley are given scant opportunity to change their fortunes \u2013 and , in the process , voters are denied their right to fully assess the options available to them .\nOn the Republican side , this has been most evident in the presence of so-called undercard debates , in which GOP candidates with low poll numbers are forced to compete separately from the rest of the race . Although somewhat justified by the massive size of the Republican field ( which started out with 17 candidates ) , by relegating its participants to a status of automatic inferiority right from the get-go , the undercard debates have implicitly mocked the notion that the party is even humoring their candidacies . \u201c They \u2019 re not candidates for president anymore . They \u2019 re barely even men , \u201d observed Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post . \u201c They \u2019 re more like the angry , tortured darkseekers from the movie \u2018 I Am Legend , \u2019 eternally scheming from their shadowy lair to lure other human beings into their grasp , ensuring that none outside of their cursed domain might live . \u201d\nBy contrast , instead of having two events on each debate night , the Democratic establishment has only scheduled six primary debates in total \u2013 and , as many critics have pointed out , aired them at times that seemed to all-but-guarantee low ratings . By limiting their voters \u2019 exposure to all their options , the party has in effect given a huge boost to whichever candidate is perceived as the frontrunner \u2013 in this case , Hillary Clinton . \u201c Look , there was a clear intent to bury these debates to the benefit of Clinton , \u201d remarked a Democratic campaign official to Politico , in reference to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz \u2019 s well-known support for Clinton \u2019 s presidential ambitions . \u201c And it is doing a disservice to the Democratic Party . The GOP is blowing out numbers \u2013 and we are protecting Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nOf course , because the Democrats only have three candidates running right now ( they started out with six , but three dropped out ) , one might assume that each would receive considerable attention simply by virtue of the small size of the field . To an extent this has been the case with Sanders , who as a staunchly left-wing alternative to Clinton has managed to break fundraising records and emerge as her chief rival in the polls for the nomination . At the same time , Sanders only received this boost because his grassroots campaign forced his poll numbers up and thus compelled the media to take him seriously . Since O \u2019 Malley has not benefited from a similar grassroots boom , he has been left in the proverbial dust by the Beltway class . Indeed , the fact that he is widely regarded as irrelevant has become the central feature of his public image , with `` Saturday Night Live '' lampooning the casual way he is routinely dismissed as a serious contender .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that , though certainly not perfect , O \u2019 Malley deserves better treatment than this . As I \u2019 ve discussed before , O \u2019 Malley has a decent record as governor of Maryland , from legalizing same-sex marriage and abolishing the death penalty to raising the minimum wage and extending in-state tuition breaks to undocumented immigrants . Just as importantly , he lacks many of the electability concerns that beset Clinton ( who has been a polarizing and scandal-plagued figure since her days as First Lady ) and Sanders ( who could be painted as a radical in the general election ) . In an election year that could see the Democratic nominee facing off against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz , any politically viable option with a progressive record at the very least warrants serious consideration .\nOn a deeper level , though , Holt \u2019 s rude treatment of O \u2019 Malley is symbolic of the fundamentally distorted way we approach major political races today . It exposes the degree to which our political primaries have been rigged \u2013 sometimes by design , sometimes by default \u2013 to favor candidates whom political and media leaders decide in advance ought to be taken seriously . Even when voters rebel against this by supporting candidates who are despised by their own parties \u2019 establishments ( Trump and Cruz among Republicans , Sanders among Democrats ) , they are still shackled by a \u201c horse race \u201d mentality which holds that only candidates who poll well and/or are regarded as predetermined \u201c frontrunners \u201d ( Jeb Bush among Republicans , Clinton among Democrats ) should be taken seriously . As a result , it makes no difference whether a political party has more than a dozen candidates or only three \u2013 if a candidate isn \u2019 t generally regarded as having a realistic chance of winning , they aren \u2019 t put in a position where they could reverse their fortunes , thereby rendering the prejudgment into a self-fulfilling prophecy .\nFor any of this to change , voters in both parties need to insist on absolute fairness when it comes to their primaries . Even if a candidate has low name recognition and abysmal polling results , we should expect that they be afforded as much air time and media attention as the candidates whose names are household words and whose polling numbers are off the charts .
