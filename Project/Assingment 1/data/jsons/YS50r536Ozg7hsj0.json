    "content": "Nikole Hannah-Jones is a reporter covering race and inequality for ProPublica , where this article is also published .\nLast July 4 , my family and I went to Long Island to celebrate the holiday with a friend and her family . After eating some barbecue , a group of us decided to take a walk along the ocean . The mood on the beach that day was festive . Music from a nearby party pulsed through the haze of sizzling meat . Lovers strolled hand in hand . Giggling children chased each other along the boardwalk .\nMost of the foot traffic was heading in one direction , but then two teenage girls came toward us , moving stiffly against the flow , both of them looking nervously to their right . \u201c He \u2019 s got a gun , \u201d one of them said in a low voice .\nI turned my gaze to follow theirs , and was clasping my 4-year-old daughter \u2019 s hand when a young man extended his arm and fired off multiple shots along the busy street running parallel to the boardwalk . Snatching my daughter up into my arms , I joined the throng of screaming revelers running away from the gunfire and toward the water .\nThe shots stopped as quickly as they had started . The man disappeared between some buildings . Chest heaving , hands shaking , I tried to calm my crying daughter , while my husband , friends and I all looked at one another in breathless disbelief . I turned to check on Hunter , a high school intern from Oregon who was staying with my family for a few weeks , but she was on the phone .\n\u201c Someone was just shooting on the beach , \u201d she said , between gulps of air , to the person on the line .\nUnable to imagine whom she would be calling at that moment , I asked her , somewhat indignantly , if she couldn \u2019 t have waited until we got to safety before calling her mom .\nMy friends and I locked eyes in stunned silence . Between the four adults , we hold six degrees . Three of us are journalists . And not one of us had thought to call the police . We had not even considered it .\nWe also are all black . And without realizing it , in that moment , each of us had made a set of calculations , an instantaneous weighing of the pros and cons .\nAs far as we could tell , no one had been hurt . The shooter was long gone , and we had seen the back of him for only a second or two . On the other hand , calling the police posed considerable risks . It carried the very real possibility of inviting disrespect , even physical harm . We had seen witnesses treated like suspects , and knew how quickly black people calling the police for help could wind up cuffed in the back of a squad car . Some of us knew of black professionals who \u2019 d had guns drawn on them for no reason .\nThis was before Michael Brown . Before police killed John Crawford III for carrying a BB gun in a Wal-Mart or shot down 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a Cleveland park . Before Akai Gurley was killed by an officer while walking in a dark staircase and before Eric Garner was choked to death upon suspicion of selling \u201c loosies. \u201d Without yet knowing those names , we all could go down a list of unarmed black people killed by law enforcement .\nWe feared what could happen if police came rushing into a group of people who , by virtue of our skin color , might be mistaken for suspects .\nFor those of you reading this who may not be black , or perhaps Latino , this is my chance to tell you that a substantial portion of your fellow citizens in the United States of America have little expectation of being treated fairly by the law or receiving justice . It \u2019 s possible this will come as a surprise to you . But to a very real extent , you have grown up in a different country than I have .\nImage OPTICS : Instagramming Bed-Stuy ( Click to view gallery . ) | Ben Baker/Redux Pictures for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine\nAs Khalil Gibran Muhammad , author of The Condemnation of Blackness , puts it , \u201c White people , by and large , do not know what it is like to be occupied by a police force . They don \u2019 t understand it because it is not the type of policing they experience . Because they are treated like individuals , they believe that if \u2018 I am not breaking the law , I will never be abused . \u2019 \u201d\nWe are not criminals because we are black . Nor are we somehow the only people in America who don \u2019 t want to live in safe neighborhoods . Yet many of us can not fundamentally trust the people who are charged with keeping us and our communities safe .\nAs protest and revolt swept across the Missouri suburb of Ferguson and demonstrators staged die-ins and blocked highways and boulevards from Oakland to New York with chants of \u201c Black lives matter , \u201d many white Americans seemed shocked by the gaping divide between law enforcement and the black communities they are supposed to serve . It was no surprise to us . For black Americans , policing is \u201c the most enduring aspect of the struggle for civil rights , \u201d says Muhammad , a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York . \u201c It has always been the mechanism for racial surveillance and control . \u201d\nIn the South , police once did the dirty work of enforcing the racial caste system . The Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement were often indistinguishable . Black-and-white photographs of the era memorialize the way Southern police sicced German shepherds on civil rights protesters and peeled the skin off black children with the force of water hoses . Lawmen were also involved or implicated in untold numbers of beatings , killings and disappearances of black Southerners who forgot their place .\nIn the North , police worked to protect white spaces by containing and controlling the rising black population that had been propelled into the industrial belt during the Great Migration . It was not unusual for Northern police to join white mobs as they attacked black homeowners attempting to move into white neighborhoods , or black workers trying to take jobs reserved for white laborers . And yet they strictly enforced vagrancy laws , catch-alls that gave them wide discretion to stop , question and arrest black citizens at will .\nTo a very real extent , you have grown up in a different country than I have .\nLast Fourth of July , in a few short minutes as we adults watched the teenager among us talking to the police , we saw Hunter become a little more like us , her faith a little shaken , her place in the world a little less stable . Hunter , who is biracial and lives with her white mother in a heavily white area , had not been exposed to the policing many black Americans face . She was about to be .\nOn the phone , she could offer only the most generic of suspect descriptions , which apparently made the officer on the other end of the line suspicious . By way of explanation , Hunter told the officer she was just 16 . The police called her back : once , twice , then three times , asking her for more information . The interactions began to feel menacing . \u201c I \u2019 m not from here , \u201d Hunter said . \u201c I \u2019 ve told you everything I know . \u201d\nThe fourth time the police called , she looked frightened . Her interrogator asked her , \u201c Are you really trying to be helpful , or were you involved in this ? \u201d She turned to us , her voice aquiver . \u201c Are they going to come get me ? \u201d\n\u201c See , \u201d one of us said , trying to lighten the mood . \u201c That \u2019 s why we don \u2019 t call them . \u201d\nMy friend Carla Murphy and I have talked about that day several times since then . We \u2019 ve turned it over in our minds and wondered whether , with the benefit of hindsight , we should have called 911 .\nCarla wasn \u2019 t born in the United States . She came here when she was 9 , and back in her native Barbados , she didn \u2019 t give police much thought . That changed when she moved into heavily black Jamaica , Queens .\nCarla said she constantly saw police , often white , stopping and harassing passersby , almost always black . \u201c You see the cops all the time , but they do not speak to you . You see them talking to each other , but the only time you ever see them interact with someone is if they are jacking them up , \u201d she said . \u201c They are making a choice , and it says they don \u2019 t care about you , it tells you they are not here for your people or people who look like you . \u201d\nCarla herself was arrested at a young age\u2014because she was present when her cousin pushed through a subway turnstile without paying . The teenagers were cuffed , thrown in a paddy wagon , booked and held overnight . At 15 , Carla , then a student at The Dalton School , a prestigious private academy in Manhattan , had an arrest record .\nThat experience , along with many others , informed Carla \u2019 s decision on July 4 .\n\u201c I am a responsible adult , but I really can \u2019 t see having a different reaction . Isn \u2019 t that weird ? \u201d she told me . \u201c By calling the police , you are inviting this big system\u2014that , frankly , doesn \u2019 t like you\u2014into your life . Sometimes you call and it is not the help that comes . \u201d\n\u201c So , no , I wouldn \u2019 t call the police , \u201d she said . \u201c Which is sad , because I want to be a good citizen . \u201d\nI moved to the historic Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn in 2011 . Before then , I had been living in Portland , Oregon , and when I chose my new home in the gritty big city , it was partly because it was only a block away from a police precinct . That proximity made me feel safer\u2014I figured crime would be less common with so many police nearby . Inadvertently , however , I also picked a prime target area of the city \u2019 s stop-and-frisk program\u2014a system of policing that caught so many innocent black and brown men in its dragnet that a federal judge found it unconstitutional in 2013 .\nMy block is fairly typical of Bed-Stuy . My neighbors , until recently , were all black and included everyone from laborers to college professors . Both immaculately kept brownstones and boarded-up townhouses line my street . We have block meetings and a community garden . Police are a constant presence , speeding down the street to the precinct or walking the beat . Sometimes , I escort my daughter to the store underneath police watchtowers with tinted windows that pop up around the neighborhood with no warning , then disappear just as suddenly\u2014their entire existence ambiguous yet alarming . I have witnessed from my window , countless times , police stopping someone , usually a young man , who is walking down the street . These men are often searched and questioned as they go to the bodega or head home from work or school .\nA few months ago , a police officer approached my neighbor as he was leaving the bodega and began questioning him . My neighbor is quiet and respectful , but he also is poor and transient . He tends to look disheveled , but the worst thing I \u2019 ve seen him do is drink beer on the stoop .\nWhen he asked why he was being stopped , the police grabbed him and threw him to the ground . As someone recorded the incident on a cellphone , police shot my neighbor with a Taser gun and then arrested him .\nHe was never told why police stopped him . The only thing they charged him with was resisting arrest . But this arrest cost him his job and a fine he will struggle to pay . If he doesn \u2019 t pay , a judge will issue a bench warrant , and instead of preventing crime , the police will have created a criminal .\nThey weren \u2019 t there to protect the neighborhood . They were there to protect themselves from us .\nAcross the street and a few doors down from me , my neighbor Guthrie Ramsey has his own story . Guthrie was born in Chicago and grew up in a family that did not emphasize the obstacles their children would face . \u201c I was socialized to believe that the police were our friends , \u201d he said .\nYet one night , some years ago , while driving his teenage son to a soccer game , Guthrie was pulled over by police . Within minutes , he and his son were sprawled on the ground , with guns drawn on them . The police believed Guthrie fit the description of a suspect . Guthrie , a short , easy-going guy with a contagious laugh , managed to point the police to his University of Pennsylvania faculty ID . That \u2019 s right : He \u2019 s an Ivy League professor . And a noted musician .\n\u201c It was so frightening . It was humiliating . You get so humiliated that it \u2019 s hard to even get to the anger , \u201d he told me . \u201c You just don \u2019 t get to experience interactions with the police as a garden-variety circumstance . \u201d\nThese types of stories in black communities are so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable . If my husband is running very late and I can not get hold of him , my mind does not immediately go to foul play . I wonder if he \u2019 s been detained .\nThis fear is not unjustified . Young black men today are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than young white men . Still , it \u2019 s not that black Americans expect to die every time they encounter the police . Police killings are just the worst manifestations of countless slights and indignities that build until there \u2019 s an explosion .\nSince 1935 , nearly every so-called race riot in the United States\u2014and there have been more than 100\u2014has been sparked by a police incident , Muhammad says . This can be an act of brutality , or a senseless killing . But the underlying causes run much deeper . Police , because they interact in black communities every day , are often seen as the face of larger systems of inequality in the justice system , employment , education and housing .\nThe View from Bed-Stuy | The author , at front , with her friends Carla Murphy and Monifa Bandele , and her husband , Faraji Hannah-Jones , in Bedford-Stuyvesant , Brooklyn . | Ben Baker/Redux Pictures for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine\nIn the months since Ferguson , many pundits have asserted that black Americans deserve this type of policing , that it is a consequence of their being more likely to be both the perpetrators and victims of violent crime . \u201c White police officers wouldn \u2019 t be there if you weren \u2019 t killing each other , \u201d former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani argued on Meet the Press as the nation awaited the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown shooting . It should be noted that Giuliani oversaw the NYPD during two of the most notorious cases of police brutality in recent memory , the sodomy of Abner Louima and the death of Amadou Diallo , who was unarmed , in a hail of 41 bullets . Both were black men .\nWhat Giuliani was saying , in essence , is that law-abiding citizens deserve to be treated with suspicion because they share racial traits with the tiny number among them who commit crimes .\nBlack communities want a good relationship with law enforcement because they want their families and property to be safe . After all , it is true that black communities often face higher rates of crime ; in 2013 , more than 50 percent of murder victims across the country were black , though only 13 percent of the total population is . But it \u2019 s also true that crime reduction efforts by black people in black communities have contributed to the recent , historic drop in crime across the country .\nSo why are black Americans still so often denied the same kind of smart policing that typically occurs in white communities , where police seem fully capable of discerning between law-abiding citizens and those committing crimes , and between crimes like turnstile-jumping and those that need serious intervention ?\n\u201c You can be protected and served , \u201d Muhammad says . \u201c It happens every day in communities across America . It happens all the time in white communities where crime is happening . \u201d\nDuring the height of the \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d protests , a mentally ill man shot and killed two police officers a few blocks from my home . I lay up that night thinking about those two men and their families . No one wants to see people killed . Not by police , not by anyone . The next morning , my husband and I took food and flowers to the grim brick precinct right around the corner from us that the officers were working out of when they were killed .\nThe officer at the front desk did not greet us when we came in . And he looked genuinely surprised by our offering , his face softening as he told us we didn \u2019 t have to do this , but thank you . That people who should be allies somehow felt like adversaries troubled me .\nThe next day , I drove by the precinct on my way to the store . It had been cordoned off with metal barricades . Two helmeted officers stood sentry out front , gripping big black assault rifles , and watching . The message felt clear .\nThey weren \u2019 t standing out there to protect the neighborhood . They were there to protect themselves from us .",

Both were black men.\n\nWhat Giuliani was saying, in essence, is that law-abiding citizens deserve to be treated with suspicion because they share racial traits with the tiny number among them who commit crimes.\n\nBlack communities want a good relationship with law enforcement because they want their families and property to be safe. After all, it is true that black communities often face higher rates of crime; in 2013, more than 50 percent of murder victims across the country were black, though only 13 percent of the total population is. But it\u2019s also true that crime reduction efforts by black people in black communities have contributed to the recent, historic drop in crime across the country.\n\nSo why are black Americans still so often denied the same kind of smart policing that typically occurs in white communities, where police seem fully capable of discerning between law-abiding citizens and those committing crimes, and between crimes like turnstile-jumping and those that need serious intervention?\n\n\u201cYou can be protected and served,\u201d Muhammad says. \u201cIt happens every day in communities across America. It happens all the time in white communities where crime is happening.\u201d\n\nDuring the height of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protests, a mentally ill man shot and killed two police officers a few blocks from my home. I lay up that night thinking about those two men and their families. No one wants to see people killed. Not by police, not by anyone. The next morning, my husband and I took food and flowers to the grim brick precinct right around the corner from us that the officers were working out of when they were killed.\n\nThe officer at the front desk did not greet us when we came in. And he looked genuinely surprised by our offering, his face softening as he told us we didn\u2019t have to do this, but thank you. That people who should be allies somehow felt like adversaries troubled me.\n\nThe next day, I drove by the precinct on my way to the store. It had been cordoned off with metal barricades. Two helmeted officers stood sentry out front, gripping big black assault rifles, and watching. The message felt clear.\n\nThey weren\u2019t standing out there to protect the neighborhood. They were there to protect themselves from us.",
