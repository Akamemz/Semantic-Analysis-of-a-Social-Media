But , I wouldn \u2019 t have expected to be shot .\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting . There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace , but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response .\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action .\nGlenn Reynolds , in Popular Mechanics , recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago . In 2009 he wrote :\nSoldiers and police are supposed to be different . \u2026 Police look inward . They \u2019 re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals , and to maintain order with a minimum of force . It \u2019 s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith . But nowadays , police are looking , and acting , more like soldiers than cops , with bad consequences . And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians .\nThe Cato Institute \u2019 s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson :\nWhy armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb ? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors ?
