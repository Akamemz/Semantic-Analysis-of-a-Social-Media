And , in a sign of just how many lines Boehner and Netanyahu crossed , so did the two Fox News hosts .\n`` I agree 100 percent , '' Wallace said when Smith read a quote from Indyk criticizing the Boehner-Netanyahu maneuver . Wallace went on :\nAnd to make you get a sense of really how , forgive me , wicked , this whole thing is , the Secretary of State John Kerry met with the Israeli Ambassador to the United States for two hours on Tuesday , Ron Dermer . The ambassador , never mentioned the fact that Netanyahu was in negotiations and finally agreed to come to Washington , not to see the president , but to go to Capitol Hill , speak to a joint session of congress and criticize the president 's policy . I have to say I 'm shocked .\nSmith said , `` it seems like [ Netanyahu 's government ] think [ s ] we do n't pay attention and that we 're just a bunch of complete morons , the United States citizens , as if we would n't pick up on what 's happening here . ''\nWallace pointed out that Netanyahu might face political backlash in Israel over this `` very risky political strategy , '' which could damage Israel 's relationship with the United States .\nHere is the backstory : On Wednesday , Boehner announced that he had invited Netanyahu to come speak to a joint session of Congress in late February ( later pushed to early March ) on Obama 's nuclear negotiations with Iran , which both Boehner and Netanyahu oppose , and which Republicans are seeking to blow up by forcing new , deal-killing sanctions on Iran . What made this such a remarkable breach is that Boehner had reached over Obama to make the invitation , which he and Netanyahu kept secret from the White House . That is a major breach in US foreign policy , which is supposed to be unified ; things like official visits by heads of state almost always go through the White House .\nPerhaps worse , Republicans are letting a foreign leader use the floor of Congress to bash the American president , thus not just allowing but helping a foreign country meddle in American foreign policy . ( This is not the first time either . Republicans invited Netanyahu to speak to Congress in 2011 , an opportunity he also used to lambast Obama . )\nFor his part , Netanyahu is once again attempting to undermine the American president who is by far his most important ally , and is using Congress as a campaign stop on his own bid for reelection in Israel 's March elections .\nWhile backlash was anticipatable , Netanyahu likely did not imagine it extending to Fox News .\n`` After watching this I think Bibi [ Netanyahu ] and [ Israeli ambassador to the US Ron ] Dermer might have finally gone too far , '' Lisa Goldman , the director of the Israel-Palestine Initiative at the New America Foundation , wrote on Facebook of the Fox News segment . `` They miscalculated the American Zeitgeist and did n't realize that when a foreign power , even a favorite ally , shows a lack of respect for US institutions , a red line has been crossed .
