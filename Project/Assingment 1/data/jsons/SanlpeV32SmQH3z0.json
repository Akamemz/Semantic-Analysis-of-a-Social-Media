CNN personalities feel compelled to support the protests, even tout them as \"beautiful\" and \"necessary.\" That happened on Tuesday afternoon's Newsroom with anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nAfter witnessing several days of rioting and looting in cities from one coast to the other, a peaceful protest in the middle of the afternoon just delighted her, and reporter Shimon Prokupecz on the scene in New York City.
