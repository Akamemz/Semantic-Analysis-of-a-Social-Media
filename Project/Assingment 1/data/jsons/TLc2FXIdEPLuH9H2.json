    "content": "There is no way to sugarcoat what happened in Virginia on Tuesday night . Ed Gillespie \u2019 s 54-45 loss to dippy Democrat Ralph Northam was an injury \u2014 particularly coming as it did on the heels of a calumnious insult in the form of the Latino Victory Fund ad which dropped a week before the election branding Gillespie \u2019 s voters as murderous rednecks desirous of turning the Commonwealth \u2019 s streets into a live-action Death Race 2017 with minority kids as the targets .\nThe race itself isn \u2019 t really as bad as the pundits will make it . Gillespie \u2019 s numbers were dismal , but so was his campaign . He presents himself as the classic swampland Republican , proudly noting his first job as a kid was parking cars at the Senate in DC and having met his wife when both were Congressional staffers . That \u2019 s anything but a background Republican voters can get excited about , and with Gillespie \u2019 s further curriculum vitae marking him as a politico and a lobbyist of Bush-era vintage it was never really credible that Gillespie could be Trump \u2019 s Man in Virginia .\nWhich didn \u2019 t stop Northam \u2019 s campaign from defining Gillespie thus , of course ; their voters and a majority of the persuadables in a state where Republicans haven \u2019 t won a statewide election in eight years are more than willing to accept whatever lies and name-calling Democrats might offer when it comes to Republican pols .\nThe problem was that Gillespie \u2019 s rather Bushy background made him a suspicious character to the Trump voters in Virginia , and he didn \u2019 t turn them out in the numbers he needed to offset the Democrats \u2019 use of Trump as a GOTV engine .\nVirginia is a blue state now . There \u2019 s no disputing that . You can \u2019 t grow the federal government as big as it is and fill it full of unionized professional Democrat bureaucrats the way the Obama administration did and not have it affect the state directly bordering DC . Those bureaucrats make six-figure salaries for very cushy work\u2014 the guess here is some of them are among the world \u2019 s best computer solitaire players , as practice makes perfect \u2014 and tend to be less than impressed with small-government messaging , whether it comes from a Gillespie or Corey Stewart . They \u2019 ll believe any attack the Dems offer about the opponent on the Right .\nWhat was disconcerting is that Northam \u2019 s camp could run that ad \u2014 and don \u2019 t let their denials of responsibility for the Latino Victory Fund \u2019 s dirty laundry fool you \u2014 and not suffer from it .\nThe ad didn \u2019 t attack Gillespie . It attacked his supporters . It was a classic case of this is what they think of us , something Republicans and conservatives are painfully accustomed to seeing from the news media , pop culture , slimeball politicians , and the arts crowd \u2014 particularly in the wake of Trump \u2019 s victory . And now that Northam has won , that ad will be repeated and copied over and over again until the Democrats recognize it doesn \u2019 t work anymore .\nThe ad should have backfired . It didn \u2019 t . Going forward , Republicans had better be prepared to return that fire with gusto .\nFor example , Gillespie , whose camp pleasured themselves with a mantra that they were running an \u201c issues-oriented campaign , \u201d should have seized upon the zanier cultural aggressions of the Democrats and accused Northam of supporting each one . Attack him as opposing the Washington Redskins \u2019 choice of team mascot . Accuse him of supporting trannies in foxholes , reparations for slavery , socialized medicine , restricted speech and all the rest of the songs from the Democrat catalogue . In each case , there is a loyal , vocal and insane Democrat constituency who will expect Northam to enthusiastically confess \u201c Guilty as charged ! \u201d to the accusation ; he either does that and drives away the persuadable voters , or he fails to do it and depresses his base .\nIt \u2019 s Politics 101 and everyone understands it but the nice-guy country-club crowd Gillespie is an avatar of . That \u2019 s why he lost so badly , and that \u2019 s the lesson to take from Virginia .\nThe Republicans \u2019 tax reform bill is mostly quite good . But it \u2019 s nevertheless a perfect example of the stupidity of Congress .\nHow long is that bill ? It \u2019 s 429 pages . No bill that long should ever be passed .\nIs it a surprise that virtually every Republican in the House and Senate can find something in the bill they find objectionable ? No , it is not .\nTax reform isn \u2019 t a bill . It \u2019 s a package . It \u2019 s a dozen bills , or more .\nThere should be a bill all its own that drops the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 . There should be another bill all its own that allows for repatriation of that overseas capital . And so on .\nThere are elements within this tax bill which can get a clear majority in favor . Go and pass those . Do it now . Make them law . If the other elements are harder and require more negotiation in order to achieve consensus , fine \u2014 bring them when they \u2019 re ready .\nThe way Congress legislates makes the perfect the enemy of the good , and that \u2019 s both lazy and stupid . These are mountains of public policy \u2014 you move a mountain a boulder at a time .\nHow we got to the point where somehow you \u2019 ve got to hit a grand slam home run or strike out on major legislation is beyond my understanding . Functionally cutting the corporate income tax rate in half would all by itself be a colossal legislative achievement that would spark significant economic growth . Ditto for passing a repatriation bill . Ditto for flattening individual rates . And majorities can be had for each of those .\nNot to mention there \u2019 s the adoption tax credit repeal in the bill .
