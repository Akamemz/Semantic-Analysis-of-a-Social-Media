He makes `` no apologies , '' he said , for wanting to target terror groups `` appropriately and in a way that is consistent with American values . ''\nSpeaking with Steve Inskeep , host of Morning Edition , Obama also urged Americans to `` keep things in perspective '' when it comes to ISIS , though he says he understands `` why people are worried . ''\n`` This is not an organization that can destroy the United States , '' he said , nor is it a `` huge industrial power '' that poses great risks to the U.S. `` institutionally or in a systemic way .

''\nHere 's how he explained why remembering `` who we are '' will lead to ISIS 's defeat :\n`` The most damage they can do ... is if they start changing how we live and what our values are , '' Obama said in an interview with NPR .
