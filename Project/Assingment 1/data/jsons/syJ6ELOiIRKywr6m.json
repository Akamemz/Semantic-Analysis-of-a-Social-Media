Regardless , under new ObamaCare rules lacking health insurance results in a large ObamaCare fine/tax , something that forces people to pay for something they ca n't afford and young people to pay for something they do n't need . Not to mention , when people are paying a fine and not receiving healthcare insurance in return , they 're simply throwing money into a black hole that could have been saved to eventually purchase a plan .\nNow , the Congressional Budget Office is out with new numbers showing an additional two million people will opt to pay the fine instead of purchasing healthcare .
