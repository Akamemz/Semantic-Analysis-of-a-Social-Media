The paper \u2019 s editors \u2019 note said the senator \u2019 s Op-Ed didn \u2019 t meet The Times \u2019 s editorial standards . To which one might ask : Would the paper have stood by the article if Cotton had made a better case for sending in troops , with stronger legal arguments and a nicer tone ? Or were the piece \u2019 s supposed flaws a pretext for achieving the politically desired result by a paper that lost its nerve in the face of a staff revolt ?\nA second criticism is that the paper could have examined Cotton \u2019 s views without giving him an unmediated platform ; that his proposal should have been evaluated by the news department , not published uncritically in the Opinion pages ; and that his arguments went beyond the moral pale .\nBut the value of Cotton \u2019 s Op-Ed doesn \u2019 t lie in its goodness or rightness . It lies in the fact that Cotton is a leading spokesman for a major current of public opinion . To suggest our readers should not have the chance to examine his opinions for themselves is to patronize them . To say they should look up his opinions elsewhere \u2014 say , his Twitter feed \u2014 is to betray our responsibility as a newspaper of record . And to claim that his argument is too repugnant for publication is to write off half of America \u2014 a remarkable about-face for a paper that , after 2016 , fretted that it was out of touch with the country we live in .\nThe most serious criticism is that publication of the piece puts black lives at risk , including members of the Times staff .\nThat \u2019 s a vital consideration , especially now , and one about which no responsible publisher can be indifferent . No one can look away from the deaths of black Americans at the hands of the police , and the overall rise in reported hate crimes in recent years .\nBut as important as it is to try to keep people safe against genuine threats , it is not the duty of the paper to make people feel safe by refusing to publish a dismaying Op-Ed . Even if one concedes that Cotton \u2019 s call to send in the troops poses potential risks , it poses those risks whether his call appears in these pages or not . To know Cotton \u2019 s views is , if nothing else , to be better armed against them .\nThe same goes for any other type of knowledge , however unpleasant : Having more of it is always a source of strength \u2014 a belief that lies at the core of our profession .",
