Kerry \u2019 s first full year as the top U.S. diplomat promises to be busy in a foreign policy landscape increasingly resistant to American dominance .\nBut analysts predict that the Obama administration is likely to hold firm to its pursuit of neutrality on the world stage by seeking diplomacy over confrontation and steering away from expensive , conventional U.S. military engagement as a strategy for containing the world \u2019 s troublemakers .\nAny number of single , unpredictable events could shake the international order in ways unseen , as was the case in mid-2013 when the horrific chemical attack blamed on the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad suddenly killed more than 1,400 people , bringing the White House to the brink of military action before a surprising cooperative push by Moscow and Washington struck a deal to destroy Syrian chemical weapon stocks .\nThe biggest foreign policy challenge for the Obama administration this year will center on how to maintain deep and sustained U.S. influence in such situations , in a world where a growing number of rising powers are gaining leverage and bent on dominating the economic , political and military developments in their own regions .\n\u201c There is a global rebalancing going on , \u201d said Gordon Adams , a professor of U.S. foreign policy at American University in Washington . \u201c It \u2019 s really messy and I think it \u2019 s going to pose the biggest challenge to American leadership not only over the next year but in the several coming years as well .\n\u201c Not only China , but Iran , the Saudis , the Turks , the Brazilians , they \u2019 re all asserting themselves in their own regions and they are not listening to the U.S. , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s not because we don \u2019 t carry a big stick ; it \u2019 s because they \u2019 re doing their own rebalancing . We can \u2019 t tell people what to do anymore . We spent 50 years doing that because those assets , and our economy , were so powerful that we could . That \u2019 s all changing very quickly . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Bombings , killing in Lebanon become common as Syrian fighting expands\nMr. Adams said such realities were exposed last year by the global \u201c fracas \u201d surrounding revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about the agency \u2019 s snooping activities targeting citizens in nations considered traditional adversaries as well as those that have been allies of the United States .\n\u201c It exposed , if you will , a kind of American assumption that we can write these rules and get what we want , \u201d he said . \u201c But now we \u2019 re getting blowback and it \u2019 s from Germany , it \u2019 s from Brazil and France , from people who have normally been our good friends and allies . \u201d\nSuch blowback appears to underscore just how fluid the landscape of international alliances has become as the world moves deeper into the 21st century . For the Obama administration , responding to international frustration \u2014 whether it be toward the NSA \u2019 s spying activities or Washington \u2019 s unilateral use of drones to clandestinely target and kill suspected terrorists in foreign lands \u2014 likely will remain high on the agenda .\nThis year , said Brian Katulis , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington , will bring \u201c continued debate on the full range of issues related to intelligence reform and the impact our intelligence agencies are having overseas . \u201d\n\u201c This includes the continued debate about the NSA , which had a major impact on the U.S. image in the world , as well as the ongoing debate about the use of drone strikes and the rise of the special operations command , \u201d Mr. Katulis said .\nMr. Katulis also pointed to China \u2019 s continued economic and military risings and the reactions by smaller Asian nations as issues likely to have \u201c broad global implications . \u201d\n\u201c I suspect that the Obama administration will maintain its overall stance of pragmatically trying to deal with growing challenges [ in East Asia ] without overplaying or underplaying its hand , \u201d he said . \u201c It will continue to engage China constructively but call out its negative actions when necessary . \u201d\nElsewhere in the world , Washington will have to cope with the prospect of a security meltdown in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces and attempt to maintain serious influence in an unstable Middle East .\n\u201c Topping the list in this category is the uncertainty about Iran , with Syria \u2019 s civil war , the transition in Egypt , and the Israeli-Palestinian talks also competing for time on the agenda , \u201d said Mr. Katulis . \u201c The administration has done a good job keeping the possibility of a deal with Iran alive and putting more time on the clock for now , but the clock is ticking . \u201d\nThe administration , he said , likely will continue to push for a historic peace agreement between Israelis and the Palestinians , particularly since Mr. Kerry seems so focused on it . \u201c But , \u201d Mr. Katulis said , \u201c the Syrian civil war , and the growing terrorist threat there , as well as continued turmoil in Egypt , could serve to upset the whole agenda . \u201d\nOne worrisome sign already : Ships waiting to remove Syria \u2019 s chemical weapons returned to port in Cyprus because Damascus missed a Dec. 31 deadline . Syria was supposed to have removed part of its chemical weapons arsenal for destruction Tuesday , but Syria \u2019 s prime minister blamed bureaucracy and security fears for delays in transporting the weapons to the Syrian port of Latakia .\nGood news may be emerging on the global economic front , particularly since the U.S. and the European Union appear to have regained some of the footing they lost during the global recession .\nIn less-noticed tectonic shifts of 2013 , the U.S. overtook Saudi Arabia as the world \u2019 s No . 1 oil producer and Mexico paved the way for private foreign investment to begin flowing into its longtime state-controlled oil industry . These two factors likely trigger major recalculations in the global economic pecking order .\nSerious U.S. influence and leadership over such trends may depend on the Obama administration \u2019 s ability to forge ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . These broad-based agreements aim to expand free trade with a focus on the European Union , Latin America and nations across Asia .\nBut the administration \u2019 s global economic agenda stands a good chance of being weighed down by political infighting and gridlock in Washington \u2014 or at least \u201c stalled by complicated trade negotiations abroad and nonfunctional politics in the midterm year at home , \u201d Mr. Katulis said .\nBiting domestic politics , Mr. Adams said , won \u2019 t help the administration cope with the growing number of nations that have \u201c drifted away in various ways from American leadership . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s going to be a domestic issue here at home because we \u2019 re in an election year and Republicans are going to do everything they can to say the Obama administration is declinist , is failing in providing leadership and is weak , \u201d he said .\nMr. Adams pointed to the irony that there \u201c is this option supported by the left of the Dems and the right of the GOP to pull back , go home and let everyone else in the world settle their own has \u2014 that we shouldn \u2019 t be sticking our nose into everyone else \u2019 s problems globally . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s the Barney Frank , Rand Paul view of the world , \u201d he said . \u201c But that \u2019 s not Obama . It \u2019 s not what \u2019 s he \u2019 s doing . \u201d\nThe president also is not embracing the \u201c traditional neocon and John McCain-Republican Party approach \u201d of a more interventionist foreign policy , added Mr. Adams . \u201c That \u2019 s not Obama , either . \u201d\nInstead , the administration is pursuing a third approach focused on simply responding to and trying to manage the \u201c global rebalancing . \u201d\n\u201c How do you manage the realities of a globe where the assertive use of American military power doesn \u2019 t always get you where you want but it doesn \u2019 t get you into trouble , either , \u201d said Mr. Adams . \u201c President Obama is going to get hammered politically in 2014 for failures of leadership , when in reality , I think what \u2019 s going on here has to do with the difficulties of trying to manage a rebalancing that would be tough for any president . \u201d",
