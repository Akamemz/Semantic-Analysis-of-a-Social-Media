    "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 An uncomfortable debate broke out this weekend as the most prominent group of Jewish Republican donors in the country gathered at Sheldon Adelson \u2019 s lavish Venetian hotel : Should criticism of President Donald Trump be allowed ?\nMany Jews have been angered by Trump \u2019 s delayed response to anti-Semitic acts and other perceived infractions . But at a closed-door session on Friday , Beverly Hills homemaker Elissa Czuker , who contributed $ 50,000 to elect Trump during the closing days of the campaign , questioned whether it was appropriate that some board members of the Republican Jewish Coalition had publicly called out the new GOP president . Others , including Florida dental insurance executive Jeffrey Feingold , pushed back on the idea of silencing Trump 's critics , according to two people who described the off-the-record meeting .\nThe tug-of-war underscored a growing divide over Trump among Republican Jews , a group that counts Adelson as its de facto leader . Many are elated by their party \u2019 s stunning election win and the fact that Barack Obama , who was seen as being openly antagonistic to Israel , is no longer in the Oval Office .\nBut in conversations here over the weekend , attendees conveyed frustration over Trump \u2019 s lack of clarity on the Middle East peace process , his failure until recently to respond forcefully to a rash of anti-Semitic acts since his election , and his administration \u2019 s decision to not mention Jews in a statement commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day . Last month , two Adelson-funded groups , the RJC and the Zionist Organization of America , criticized the White House for the latter omission .\nSome attendees said they were relieved last week when Trump spoke out after the desecration of a Jewish cemetery . But they \u2019 re looking for more .\n\u201c Actions speak louder than words , \u201d said one donor , who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the White House . \u201c It 's one thing to say there is no place for anti-Semitism in our communities , but what is he going to do about it ? \u201d\nOthers fretted that Trump \u2019 s unpredictable temperament will thwart his efforts to reach a peace accord . \u201c People are worried that he \u2019 s a loose cannon , \u201d said one attendee . `` There 's a real concern that he could slide off the edge . \u201d\nStill others are suspicious that the administration will renege on its promises , such as Trump \u2019 s oft-repeated pledge that he would move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . When Vice President Mike Pence addressed RJC members at a Shabbat dinner on Friday evening , he would say only that the White House is \u201c assessing \u201d a possible move \u2014 a walk-back that drew a decidedly muted response .\n\u201c Every White House has missteps , \u201d remarked one conference visitor . Trump has `` a different style from George W. Bush , and we 're going to have to get used to that . \u201d\nBehind the scenes , the White House is taking steps to win over Republican Jews , a small but influential group . It has enlisted the 83-year-old Adelson , whose estimated $ 30 billion net worth has made him one of the Republican Party \u2019 s most sought-after donors , as an unofficial adviser . Two senior Trump aides , Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon , have been holding regular and detailed conversations with Adelson about Israel , his longtime passion and focus .\nAdelson recently flew to Washington , where he dined with the president and offered his views on how an Israeli-Palestinian peace process could play out . The mogul has spoken highly of David Friedman , Trump \u2019 s hawkish pick to serve as U.S. ambassador to Israel .\nThe outreach has gone further . Kushner , a 36-year-old Orthodox Jew who is leading the Trump push for a Middle East peace deal , has been in touch with RJC executive director Matt Brooks about a variety of issues . A few weeks after the RJC criticized the administration over the Holocaust statement , Brooks was invited to the White House and met briefly with the president .\nAlso visiting the White House recently was Sara Bloomfield , director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum . She met for breakfast with Trump spokesman Boris Epshteyn , who has been identified as the Trump aide who wrote the much-criticized Holocaust statement . ( Neither Bloomfield nor Epshteyn would comment on the meeting . )\nThe administration is also working to combat charges that it has tolerated or tacitly condoned anti-Semitic sentiment . Pence last week visited the Jewish cemetery outside St. Louis that was vandalized . And on Friday , during his RJC speech , the vice president delivered a forceful repudiation of anti-Semitism , saying that it had \u201c no place \u201d in America .\nPence \u2019 s remarks came a few days after Trump , responding to the toppling of 170 graves at the cemetery , said that \u201c anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community at community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. \u201d Kushner played a key role in encouraging the president to speak out on the matter , according to a person briefed on the discussions .\nLooking to have a presence at the RJC , the White House dispatched Epshteyn , a Russian-born Jewish immigrant , to Las Vegas for this weekend \u2019 s gathering . At Friday \u2019 s board meeting , he was asked how the party could refute accusations that the administration was stirring anti-Jewish views .\nEpshteyn delivered a detailed answer that included offering an assurance to the group that Bannon is not anti-Semitic , according to two people present . The website that Bannon oversaw before joining the White House , Breitbart News , has been accused of publishing anti-Semitic content . Many attendees agreed that , to the contrary , Bannon has made clear he \u2019 s a staunch ally of the Jewish community .\n`` Whatever conversations I 've had with people in the White House have been more than satisfactory in terms of the issues I 've been concerned about , '' said Mort Klein , a friend of Adelson and president of the Zionist Organization of America . Klein had criticized Trump several times during his first days in office , but said , `` I could n't be more sanguine '' now .\n\u201c If there was a hint of anti-Semitism in this administration , \u201d added Klein , the son of Holocaust survivors , \u201c I 'd be all over them . ''\nMany said they saw Trump \u2019 s ascendance \u2014 and Obama \u2019 s exit \u2014 as cause for celebration .
