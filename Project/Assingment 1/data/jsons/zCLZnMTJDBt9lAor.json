Vote in Urgent Poll\n\nAn angry President Barack Obama denounced Senate Republicans on Wednesday for failing to pass stricter background checks on gun purchases, calling it a \u201cpretty shameful day\u201d for Washington.Speaking in the Rose Garden as the families of some of the victims of the Newtown, Conn., shootings looked on, Obama vowed to press on in the fight for tougher gun laws.\u201cFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders,\u201d he said, standing alongside former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who left Congress after suffering a life-threatening gunshot wound to the head. \u201cA few minutes ago a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even when these families looked on from the gallery.\u201dEarlier, Senate Republicans, backed by rural-state Democrats, blocked legislation to tighten restrictions on the sale of firearms.In recent weeks, the families of some of the victims of the December shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School pressed lawmakers with stories of personal loss, as Second Amendment advocates countered that none of the proposed changes would have stopped the grisly tragedy.Attempts to ban assault-style rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines also faced certain defeat in a series of showdown votes.The background check measure commanded a majority of senators, 54-46, but that was well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. A total of 41 Republicans and five Democrats pulled together to scuttle the plan.\u201cThe gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,\u201d Obama said, referring to fears by some that the law would allow for creation of a federal gun registry.The president alluded to polls that peaked at 90 percent of Americans supporting expanded background checks for convicted criminals and the severely mentally ill. He said \u201c90 percent\u201d of Democrats supported the bill, but \u201c90 percent\u201d of Republicans opposed it.\u201cThere were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt came down to politics.\u201dThe National Rifle Association issued a statement shortly after Wednesday's vote calling the Manchin-Toomey-Schumer proposal \u201cmisguided\u201d and saying that the measure would have criminalized \u201ccertain private transfers\u201d of guns between honest citizens.\u201cAs we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools,\u201d said the statement issued by Chris W. Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist.\u201cThe NRA will continue to work with Republicans and Democrats who are committed to protecting our children in schools, prosecuting violent criminals to the fullest extent of the law, and fixing our broken mental health system,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWe are grateful for the hard work and leadership of those senators who chose to pursue meaningful solutions to our nation\u2019s most pressing problems.\u201dObama said that most Americans think that the tougher background checks are already required by law.While Wednesday's bill would not have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy, and would not prevent all future gun deaths, he said it should have been passed to save lives.\u201cThis legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs,\u201d Obama said.The president vowed to work without Congress if necessary to do more in his effort to cut gun violence. He said the White House will address barriers to states participating in the existing background check system, give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns, and help put emergency plans for schools in place.\u201cWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere,\u201d Mark Barden, the father of murdered 7-year-old Daniel, said before the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cAny dad in America can be in my shoes.\u201dSen. Majority Leader Harry Reid also blasted Republicans for the vote.\u201cI want everyone to understand this is just the beginning. This is not the end,\u201d he told reporters after the vote. \u201cNinety percent of Democrats here on the floor stood with 90 percent of the American people for expanding background checks. I appreciate very much a handful of Republicans that crossed the aisle to stand with us on this common-sense issue.\u201dHe promised to keep up the fight for background checks. \u201cThe fight has just begun. It's not going away,\u201d said Reid.\u201cWe will win this fight,\u201d added Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cWe will not rest until we win.\u201dThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
