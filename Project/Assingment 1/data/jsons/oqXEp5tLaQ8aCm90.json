You know him \u2014 he \u2019 s on the tube every day .\nI won \u2019 t name him \u2014 he \u2019 d deny it , and there \u2019 s no tape recording . But the tale comes from a friend I trust , someone who witnessed this incident first-hand , and someone who has no reason to lie . It \u2019 s solid .\nMy friend was in the studio with the host and another guest . A woman , who happened to be black and very beautiful , was being patched in from a remote studio .\nThey blabbed and bloviated , then went to a commercial break . During the lull , the host leaned in to my friend \u2014 his mouth right next to his ear \u2014 and whispered : \u201c I can \u2019 t believe we used to own those . \u201d\nI \u2019 ve remembered the story ever since , not only because of the prominence of the show \u2019 s host , but because it is the most racist thing I \u2019 ve ever heard . Hands down . It was a thought that had never occurred to me , a white man , when looking at a black woman . And certainly not in the 21st century .\nStill , I felt ashamed . I \u2019 m one of them , I guess . He thinks it , I don \u2019 t , but who will know ? I don \u2019 t agree , hate him for his racism , but I \u2019 m white , he \u2019 s white , so I \u2019 m one of them . It was a sad revelation . And it always amazes me what one white man will say to another . Sickens me is more right . Even today .\nAmerica has had to own her sins . Rightly . Slavery is the worst ( although the internment of 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II was also pretty atrocious ) . What we did to women for more than a century was criminal . But slavery . Our biggest sin , forever .\nWhile the Founders constructed the greatest documents in the history of mankind \u2014 the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution \u2014 their promises were , sadly , a lie .\nBlacks could be legally owned for nearly 80 years after that band of white men penned the Constitution . That Independence pledge \u2014 that \u201c All men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u201d \u2014 didn \u2019 t apply to blacks ( and not to women either ) .\nAmerica \u2019 s progress was patchy . The North fought against the black vote , even after it had backed an end to slavery . Jim Crow laws in the South \u2014 propagated by racist Democrats \u2014 pitted race against race , well into the 1960s . Communists used America \u2019 s racist past as propaganda against the newfangled \u201c democracy \u201d \u2014 pretty words , but no action . They were right .\nAll that changed when a white Republican , Dwight D. Eisenhower , sent federal troops into the racist South to escort nine black students into an all-white school . White Republicans then battled white southern Democrats to pass the Civil Rights Act . Racism \u2014 at least the official version sanctioned by the government \u2014 ended .\nBut that didn \u2019 t end racism . Skip ahead 50 years , to now . There \u2019 s a racist NBA owner .
