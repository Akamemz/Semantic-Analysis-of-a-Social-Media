    "content": "While the scandal surrounding the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton during her time as U.S. secretary of state continues to grow , Clinton has resorted to laughing it off . This past weekend she told an audience of Iowa Democrats that she loves her Snapchat account because the messages automatically disappear . Not everyone is laughing .\nClinton admits deleting 30,000 government emails from her time in office . She claims they were personal , and that because they were also on a personal server , she was free to destroy them . Yet , federal law defines emails used during the course of one \u2019 s work for the federal government as the property of the federal government .\nShe could have designated which of the government \u2019 s emails were personal and then asked the government to send them to her and delete them from government servers . Instead she did the reverse . She decided which of her emails were governmental and sent them on to the State Department . Under federal law , that is not a determination she may lawfully make .\nYet , the 55,000 emails she sent to the feds were printed emails . By doing so , she stole from the government the metadata it owns , which accompanies all digital emails but is missing on the paper copies , and she denied the government the opportunity to trace those emails .\nWhen asked why she chose to divert government emails through her own server , Clinton stated she believed it would enable her to carry just one mobile device for both personal and governmental emails . She later admitted she carried four such devices .\nThen the scandal got more serious , as Clinton \u2019 s lawyers revealed that after she deleted the 30,000 emails , and printed the 55,000 she surrendered to the feds , she had the server that carried and stored them professionally wiped clean .\nShe had already denied routing classified materials through her server : \u201c I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email . \u2026 [ I ] did not send classified material . \u201d\nThen , the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community , each independent of the other , found four classified emails from among a random sample of 40 .\nThen the State Department inspector general concluded that one of the four was in fact top secret . Since it discussed satellite imagery of a foreign country and since it revealed intercepts of communications among foreign agents , it received additional legal protections that were intended to assure that it was only discussed in a secure location and never shared with a foreign government , not even an ally .\nWhen Clinton was confronted with these facts , she changed her explanation from \u201c I did not send classified material \u201d to \u201c I never sent or never received any email marked classified. \u201d Not only is she continually changing her story , but she is being deceptive again . Emails are not \u201c marked classified. \u201d They are marked \u201c top secret \u201d or \u201c secret \u201d or \u201c confidential. \u201d Her explanations remind one of her husband \u2019 s word-splitting playbook .\nLast weekend the State Department located 305 of her undeleted emails that likely are in the top secret or secret or classified categories .\nWhat should be the consequence of her behavior with the nation \u2019 s most sensitive secrets ?\nIf Clinton is indicted for failure to secure classified information , she will no doubt argue that if one of the above markings was not on the email , she did not know it was top secret . If she does make that incredible argument -- how could satellite photos of a foreign country together with communications intercepts of foreign agents possibly not be top secret ? -- she will be confronted with a judicial instruction to the jury trying her .\nThe judge will tell the jury that the secretary of state is presumed to know what is top secret and what is not . The only way she could rebut that presumption is to take the witness stand in her own defense and attempt to persuade the jury that she was so busy , she didn \u2019 t notice the nature of the secrets with which she was dealing .\nNot only would such an argument be incredible coming from a person of her intellect and government experience , but it begs the question .
