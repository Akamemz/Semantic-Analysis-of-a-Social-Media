''\nThe other side of the coin ? Immediately following Trump 's `` rapists '' statement \u2014 worded by the study authors in such a way that could be taken as `` all Mexican immigrants '' \u2014 he said he assumed others coming across the border are `` good people . '' And the often-deployed `` very fine people '' claim \u2014 insisting Trump was speaking of neo-Nazis in Charlottesville \u2014 has been debunked .

''\nTo be sure , changes in expressed prejudice in this period might be the product of factors other than Trump : the decade in question saw events including the election of the first Black president and rising attention to police-involved shootings .
