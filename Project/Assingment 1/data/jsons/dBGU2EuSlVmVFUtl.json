Also known as HR 1, symbolically their first legislation, it is a 571-page compendium of existing problems and proposed solutions in four political hot zones: voting, political money, redistricting and ethics.\n\nA pledge to pass the bill was a common theme among Democratic House candidates last year.\n\n\"We heard loud and clear from the American people,\" Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., told reporters Friday. \"They feel left out and locked out from their own democracy.\"\n\nIf the bill ever becomes law, it's unlikely to happen this year. Republicans control the Senate, President Trump is in the White House, and the GOP vehemently opposes the basic approach of HR 1.\n\n\"This is obviously a pretty radical expansion of the regulation of political speech,\" said David Keating, president of the conservative Institute for Free Speech. \"If this bill had become law now,\" he said, anti-Trump groups \"would find it very difficult to speak as effectively as they have over the past two years.\"\n\nSome of the bill's provisions push the envelope, including reaching into state law.

The bill includes an update of the Disclose Act, a pro-transparency measure that Democrats have introduced regularly since 2010 \u2014 not that Republicans are any more likely to embrace it than they were back then.\n\nHere's a rundown of the bill's major provisions:\n\nVoting and election laws\n\nVoter registration would be made easier. Citizens could register online or get registered automatically, via data from driver's licenses or other government sources. For federal elections, states would have to provide same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Election Day would be a federal holiday.\n\nThe bill would crack down on efforts to take voters off the rolls or prevent them from casting ballots.
