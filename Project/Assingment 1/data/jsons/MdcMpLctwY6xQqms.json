    "content": "I was perusing the real-estate listings for Palo Alto , California , and spotted a stylish , remodeled midcentury ranch house with a whopping 1,700 square feet on a postage-stamp lot for a mere $ 2.6 million . What a deal ! There are great jobs all around that lovely Bay Area city , the heart of Silicon Valley and home to prestigious Stanford University . But imagine the income one would need to , say , put $ 700,000 down and make a $ 13,000 monthly housing payment .\nPalo Alto is near the top of the food chain , but California \u2019 s coastal housing prices \u2014 even in run-down and dangerous cities \u2014 typically top a half-million bucks . And those median prices will get you a cottage or a little condo with a view of the freeway . Bay Area friends \u2014 even ones with $ 150,000-plus incomes \u2014 live with roommates or rack up 35,000 miles a year commuting in bumper-to-bumper misery from the boondocks . Southern California isn \u2019 t much better .\nFortunately , the U.S. Census Bureau has taken that reality into account in its supplemental formula for determining the nation \u2019 s poverty rates . Its recently released data show a significant uptick in household income ( 5.2 percent ) since 2014 and a slight drop ( 1.2 percent ) in the poverty rate . But in high-cost-of-living states , particularly California , those numbers were far less encouraging . Despite its reputation for wealth , California once again had the highest poverty rate in the nation , with nearly 21 percent of its residents unable to afford the basics .\nCalifornia \u2019 s leaders are proud of their continual efforts to expand the number of welfare-type programs available to residents . In fact , the Census Bureau points to all the many governmental assistance programs that boost poor Californians \u2019 take-home income . Even if one supports those wealth-transfer programs , it \u2019 s clear they don \u2019 t come anywhere close to alleviating problems caused by the state \u2019 s housing prices .\nThe governor and Democratic legislators \u201c raised the state \u2019 s minimum wage , improved overtime pay for farm and domestic workers , enacted an earned-income tax credit , expanded health and welfare benefits , and provided extra money for the educations of poor students , \u201d explained the Sacramento Bee \u2019 s Dan Walters . But they failed \u201c to confront the heaviest burden on poor families , \u201d which is of course the state \u2019 s \u201c soaring housing costs . \u201d\nMany of the coastal liberals I know blame the housing problems on the desirability of living in some of California \u2019 s magnificent coastal enclaves , but that argument has been so thoroughly debunked it \u2019 s silly to even bring it up any more .

As I \u2019 ve reported for the Spectator , 40 percent of the price of a new single-family home in the San Diego area is attributed to government fees and permits . That regulatory cost \u2014 around $ 260,000 \u2014 is about 20 percent more than the median home price in the United States . Is it any wonder poor people struggle to live here ?
