And President Trump is often assertive toward his enemies \u2014 or his allies \u2014 and talks tough about immigration and NFL players kneeling during the national anthem . But these things do not add up to a powerful presidency .\nPolitical scientists generally measure a president \u2019 s power according to his ability to influence public policy outcomes compared to past presidents or contemporary actors , like Congress . A strong president sets the legislative agenda , passes policies reflecting his preferences , and secures bureaucratic action on his governing priorities . A weak president has difficulty achieving these things , as competing political actors impede his goals and jockey to assert their own influence .\nIn his classic 1960 book Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents , Richard Neustadt famously defined presidential power as \u201c the power to persuade. \u201d A president must convince other political actors that their own interests lie in going along with him , or at least not standing in his way , Neustadt suggested .\nThat definition helps to explain why the passage of tax reform is best interpreted as yet more evidence of the president \u2019 s weakness , rather than as a sudden demonstration of new stature . Trump appears to have had little influence over the timing or substance of the policies the House and Senate devised ; in general , he seems content to simply sign on to whatever agenda congressional Republican leaders set . Far from unifying Republicans around a Trump agenda , he appears reduced to cheerleading for a Republican one .\nThe determination that Trump is a weak president , struggling to assert power \u2014 and indeed on the brink of a failed presidency \u2014 ought to be cold comfort to Democrats and liberals , because weak presidents can be dangerous leaders . While more vulnerable to electoral defeat , they may also be tempted to take risks \u2014 including foreign policy risks \u2014 to increase their stature . And that could lead to disaster .\nNeustadt \u2019 s key insight was that the presidency has few formal powers , and presidents consequently must bargain to secure cooperation from numerous political actors . Members of Congress have endless opportunities to support or oppose a president \u2019 s legislative program ; executive branch actors can follow or ignore presidential direction ; judges can rule for or against presidential positions ; outside groups can support or oppose policy proposals ; and the media selects issues to highlight or downplay . In every instance , these actors weigh the political costs and benefits of support and opposition .\nA president \u2019 s chief resource for persuasion is his professional reputation , ideally that of a winner who achieves objectives and punishes opposition . Political actors constantly anticipate the reaction of the president ( and others ) to their choices . They will hesitate to oppose or ignore you if they foresee a lonely loss or fear a harsh punishment ; no one in Washington sticks out a neck if it might get cut off . Conversely , support becomes elusive if there are concerns you can \u2019 t get the job done , and actors may see opportunities to assert their own power against you . Winning begets winning ; losing begets losing .\nPublic prestige , Neustadt argued , is a related weapon in the president \u2019 s arsenal , and it operates similarly \u2014 but mediated through voters , not Washington power brokers . Political actors in a democracy are always fearful of losing public support . It can cost a public official their job , harm a judge \u2019 s prestige , or ruin an interest group . To cross a popular president risks him directing his popularity against your own . As with professional reputation , presidents who make strategic choices that enhance their prestige will find it available as a future resource .\nAll of this takes enormous political skill . \u201c The presidency is no place for amateurs , \u201d Neustadt famously wrote . Consequently , skillful management of power enhances itself . His ideal figure was FDR , a master cultivator of both professional reputation and public prestige . His foils were Truman and Eisenhower . Where FDR had an intuitive genius for wielding power and obsessive drive for amassing it , Neustadt saw Truman as insufficiently attentive to the nuances of developing sustained power . Eisenhower , Neustadt argued , came into office a public hero , but completely lacked the political acumen necessary to leverage it for influence .\nFor a new president , then , Neustadt lays out a road map to sustained power : demonstrate immediate competence by strategically choosing early legislative and administrative priorities to win victories and build your reputation . Accurately assess your standing to avoid early confrontations you may lose . And rapidly learn the nuances of bureaucratic power in the White House and executive branch , to master which levers to pull , when to pull them , and whom not to annoy .\nAs Neustadt would undoubtedly note , there \u2019 s now an amateur in the White House . And through the framework he developed , Trump has had a disastrous first year . His professional reputation is awful . Major figures from his own party routinely criticize his impulsive rhetoric and chaotic management , belittle his intelligence , mock his political ideas , and bemoan his lack of policy knowledge . The White House issues talking points , and high-ranking Republicans simply ignore them . Multiple Republican-led congressional committees are investigating his administration on topics ranging from ethics violations to foreign electoral collusion .\nSimilarly , the president \u2019 s public prestige , measured by approval ratings , is among the worst in the polling age . He entered office with record-low approval , 45 percent , and it has steadily declined into the 30s . No other president has had an approval lower than 49 percent in December of his first year ; the average is 63 percent . Such numbers sap Trump \u2019 s power to leverage popularity into persuasion . They also depress party loyalists concerned about 2018 and embolden potential primary challengers for 2020 .\nSome of this presidential weakness is an unavoidable byproduct of a bitter campaign and an election victory in which he lost the popular vote . But Trump has also failed to heed Neustadt \u2019 s strategic advice . He \u2019 s made simple errors that have damaged his professional reputation and public prestige \u2014 and ultimately his power .\nNeustadt advised presidents to choose an early agenda that would demonstrate competence . Trump \u2019 s first major policy choice was the disastrous executive order travel ban , which was poorly written , developed without consulting executive branch experts , and implemented without warning . It was ultimately withdrawn after being struck down by courts , but not before Trump fired the acting attorney general for refusing to defend it . In less than a month , Trump had demonstrated incompetence \u2014 and peeved executive , legislative , and judicial actors he \u2019 d need on his side for the rest of his term .\nSince then , emboldened by those early missteps , political actors across the spectrum have defied Trump . In June , Trump sought to end the military \u2019 s policy of allowing transgender troops to serve . His initial announcement was met with unusual and blunt public pushback from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , followed later by pushback from the secretary of defense , followed by a court striking down the order last week .\nIn August , business leaders abandoned Trump following his comments about a white supremacy rally , forcing him to disband advisory councils he had touted . Trump has also had contentious relationships with Cabinet secretaries and high turnover among senior White House staff . To put it mildly , Trump is widely perceived as needing significant staff management .\nLegislative weakness \u2014 up to and including on tax reform\nAbove all , Neustadt argued , strong presidents set agendas and influence policy outcomes . In the legislative realm , Trump has done neither . Despite unified government , almost no major legislation has passed . Many observers have noted the high rates at which Republican members vote with Trump , but such stats are misleading . As with tax reform , such correlations usually involve Trump having adopted the position of the congressional Republicans , not the other way around .\nWhat fraction of Trump \u2019 s agenda ( distinct from the GOP agenda ) has Congress even considered ? Not a border wall or other immigration restrictions . Not major protectionist legislation . The president did submit a budget for fiscal year 2018 , which was declared dead on arrival by Democrats and Republicans . It has been almost totally ignored by appropriators , just as Trump \u2019 s suggested 2017 budget numbers were . One important bill that was approved was a trade measure Trump opposed , reducing his discretion to adjust sanctions against Russia . That one passed almost unanimously .\nThe president \u2019 s top legislative objective \u2014 Obamacare repeal \u2014 was defeated , but not before Trump leaned on Republican representatives to support a bill that he later repudiated as \u201c mean , \u201d leaving those who voted for it hanging out to dry . Throughout the process , Trump announced contradictory policy positions , blindsided allies with changing tactics , and publicly bickered with key lawmakers . Having built up a reservoir of ill will with key senators , he was unable to pull the final bill across the finish line . Maybe he should have started with an infrastructure bill .\nNominations tell a similar story about a leader with little influence . It \u2019 s true no Trump nominee failed on the floor . But floor votes almost never fail ; leaders don \u2019 t bring them up unless they \u2019 re confident they \u2019 ll pass . Twelve Trump nominations , however , have been withdrawn . And presidents don \u2019 t nominate people they know the Senate will never approve . That explains why Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn got White House jobs while Elaine Chao , Steve Mnuchin , and James Mattis got Senate-confirmed positions . Likewise , Trump \u2019 s nominee to chair the Federal Reserve is not a populist hero but an establishment Republican . Most of Trump \u2019 s nominees reflect GOP priorities , not the president \u2019 s campaign promises .\nTrump \u2019 s scope of action has been constrained by his early missteps\nWeakness is both a consequence of a president \u2019 s prior political actions and a constraint on his future options . Trump \u2019 s weakness , for example , makes it less likely he \u2019 ll fire Bob Mueller , the special counsel he loathes , and more likely he will face consequences if he does . If Trump had a strong professional reputation , a 58 percent approval rating , and had recently repealed the ACA and passed tax cuts , he might weather firing Mueller . Instead , such an action might precipitate the end of his presidency .\nRecently , retiring Republican Sens . Bob Corker and Jeff Flake strongly broke with the president , saying , respectively , that he \u201c debases our country \u201d and is \u201c dangerous to our democracy. \u201d Some critics dismissed these broadsides as mere rhetoric paired with no action . This is misguided . In politics , such criticisms are actions ; they signal voters looking for approval cues and elites in need of political cover . The lack of pushback against Corker and Flake from their Republican colleagues also sent a clear message : If you want to challenge the president or his agenda , we won \u2019 t come after you .\nA core Neustadt principle is that the president \u2019 s formal powers are far too weak to sustain him , absent help from the other political branches \u2014 including members of his own party . And no presidency , save the utter failures of Andrew Johnson and John Tyler , has lacked co-partisan support to the degree Trump does . The Republican Party has not thrown the president overboard ; their collective electoral and policy incentives do not ( yet ) support that . But they seem content to let him flounder .\nTrump \u2019 s aggressive norm breaking has also awakened institutional patriotism across the system \u2014 including the judiciary . Trump has repeatedly ridiculed federal judges who have ruled against him , prompting then-Supreme Court nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch to publicly repudiate Trump \u2019 s criticism . With several cases regarding the government \u2019 s power over immigrant deportation and detention on the docket this term , and the third version of the travel ban back on the radar , would it be surprising if the Court sought to assert its own power ?\nAmerica has invested tremendous administrative responsibility in the modern presidency . And even the best system of laws can not function well when there is a vacuum at the top . The presidency is also uniquely positioned to handle matters of state and foreign crises ; in this respect , the presidency has actually grown more powerful in the modern era . A weak and constrained president may see opportunity in risky or destructive action , at home or abroad , in an attempt to reverse his fortunes and exert authority .\nPolitical actors on the left and right may see partisan or ideological benefits in a severely weakened Trump presidency . But while Democrats may cheer the congressional rejection of the Trump budget and the administrative incompetence that doomed the travel ban , they should be nervous \u2014 as Americans \u2014 about just how weak Trump has become . A president unable to effectively govern the bureaucracy or lead American foreign policy poses a distinctly nonpartisan problem for the nation .\nMatthew Glassman is a senior fellow at Georgetown University \u2019 s Government Affairs Institute .
