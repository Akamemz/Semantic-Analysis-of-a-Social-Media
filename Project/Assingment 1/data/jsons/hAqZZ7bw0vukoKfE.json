No One Trumped Trump . It wasn \u2019 t for a lack of effort . Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ripped into Donald Trump less than 30 seconds into the debate \u2019 s start over Internet policy .

Better to construct one \u2019 s own case , rather than try to deconstruct The Donald .\nBlame it on the candidates \u2019 approach and Wolf Blitzer \u2019 s herky-jerky style of questioning ( like watching a 16-year-old drive a stick-shift for the first time ) : how many of Trump \u2019 s rivals made a lasting impression as to how they \u2019 d defeat ISIS and protect the homeland ?\n2 . The Cage Match . At various points , Paul took swings at Trump , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie .

Ted Cruz . Both were too smart to take the bait .\nCruz didn \u2019 t expound on his differences with Trump over the Muslim immigration ban or a previous comment suggesting he thought Trump lacked a presidential temperament . Trump expressed \u201c great respect \u201d for the other candidates on the stage and ruled out an independent run ( the night \u2019 s biggest news ) .\nTime will tell whether what Trump said in Vegas stayed in Vegas .\nCruz did have some momentary tussles \u2013 with Rubio over Senate votes ( always a good way to put an audience to sleep ) . And Trump : his testiest moments came in a personal back-and-forth with Bush over demeanor and poll numbers .\n3 . Executive Order . It was a national security debate long on tough talk about leadership skills , which would seem an opening for the two sitting governors looking for a leg-up in this race : Christie and Ohio Gov . John Kasich .\nFor Christie , the problem was numbers . Yes , he had some good moments connecting national security to his New Jersey heritage . However , nine candidates and a round-robin style of Q & A too often reduced Christie to interjecting himself into the debate to remind viewers of just how vapid senators can be ( Carly Fiorina also went down this path , at several points jumping into the cross-talk to bemoan the awfulness of the political class ) .\nAs for Kasich , it \u2019 s a matter of rhetorical substance abuse . Three governors past and present have departed the race . A fourth , Bush , is struggling to stay relevant .
