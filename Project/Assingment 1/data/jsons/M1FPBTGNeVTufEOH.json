    "content": "Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2019 s email narrative had finally seemed to run its course as a top news story when Washington was entering the dog days of summer .\nThen , from of all places , her former place of employment \u2014 the State Department \u2014 suddenly injected new life into the scandal on July 1 by announcing that a significant number of her private stash of emails contained classified information .\nThat made her exclusive use of an unsecured , at-home server during her tenure as secretary of state a far more serious affair . As The \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that day , government regulations mandate that officials conduct an inquiry to judge the lengths to which the secrets were disseminated , including inspecting her server and other media devices .\nThe first steps toward that possible outcome became public July 24 , when two inspectors general issued statements chastising Mrs. Clinton , the Democratic presidential front-runner , for keeping secrets on an unprotected server .\nAccording to a point-by-point analysis , the inspectors \u2019 memos directly contradict Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s explanation for months on how she operated her email account to conduct State Department business instead of a State.gov address like every other employee .\nMrs. Clinton and her backers repeatedly have said she did not circulate classified information while secretary of state , and if there were such information , it was not secret during her 2009-2013 tenure .\nBut a memo from I. Charles McCullough III , the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community , and a joint statement by he and the State Department IG , said information stored on the server was classified at the time it was disseminated .\nMrs. Clinton has said in interviews that she followed all government rules in her unusual email arrangement .\nBut again , the IG said in his memo to Congress that classified information in her emails should never have been stored on an unsecure , private server . In other words , he suggests she violated the procedures for handling classified information , a failing that can result in government workers being reprimanded or criminally charged .\nA day after the IGs spoke out on July 24 , Mrs. Clinton clung to her explanation , saying the investigators were wrong and nothing was classified at the time .\nBut several days later , her traveling press secretary , Nick Merrill , did not repeat that defense when asked by The Times to respond to specification allegations made by IG investigators .\nMr. Merrill said : \u201c We have had a chance to review the statement released by the Inspectors General of the State Department and Intelligence Community outlining their concerns with regard to the State Department \u2019 s review and release of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s work emails . We want to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed as these emails are reviewed while not unduly delaying the release of her emails . We particularly do not want their release to be hampered by bureaucratic infighting among the Intelligence Community . More emails are slated to be released by the State Department next week , and we hope that release is as inclusive as possible . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s reliance on a server kept at her home in Chappaqua , New York , could prompt a formal investigation by the FBI \u2019 s Counterintelligence Division , which handles cases of unauthorized disclosures of government secrets .\nThomas Fitton , president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 there is sufficient indication of wrongdoing for Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to appoint a special prosecutor .\n\u201c Loretta Lynch should appoint a special prosecutor immediately , \u201d said Mr. Fitton , who has sued the administration to force the release of documents . \u201c The Obama Justice Department is conflicted , and the alleged crimes and cover-up not only implicate Mrs. Clinton but other senior administration officials , including Secretary of State [ John F. ] Kerry and lawyers in the Justice Department . Even President Obama and the White House have been sketchy on what they knew about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email system . The public interest demands a serious and independent criminal investigation . \u201d\nP.J . Crowley , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s spokesman during the first year of her tenure at the State Department , said Republicans risk losing voters if they make her emails a big campaign issue .\n\u201c I would like to think the American people will want to hear more about the state of the economy , the cost of health care and the security of the homeland , \u201d Mr. Crowley said . \u201c If their big issue is the fact she used a private network to email her staff , I like her chances in the general election . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton has said she used her private server as a convenience instead of having to tote around two devices , one for herself and one for State.gov .\nBut security experts said the arrangement might have hand-delivered damaging information to U.S. enemies who know how to hack computer networks .\n\u201c It is equivalent to leaving classified docs stacked in the middle of a public library , \u201d said Larry Johnson , a former CIA analyst and an expert on handling classified information . \u201c It makes us more vulnerable to foreign threats . \u201d\nMr. McCullough , a former FBI agent and longtime intelligence community official , sent a formal security referral to the FBI last month requesting an investigation for \u201c potential compromise of classified information . \u201d\nThat politically charged decision \u2014 a Democratic administration investigating the email practices of the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 ultimately rests with Ms. Lynch .\nThe two-page referral is stamped \u201c official use only. \u201d The Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) was in the process of sanitizing the two pages for release , but then handed it off to the Justice Department . An FBI spokesman referred a reporter to the Justice Department , which did not respond to queries . The referral could shed more light on the type of classified information contained in Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nMr. McCullough and his counterpart at State , Inspector General Steve Linick , issued two statements that greatly changed the debate on Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s private emails .\nHer personal email messaging was not known publicly until the House Select Committee on Benghazi pressed State to turn over her emails . The reply came back that they resided with her , not with a State server .\nMrs. Clinton then unilaterally reviewed thousands of emails and turned over about 30,000 to State in December 2014 . She says she wiped the server clean of thousands more that presumably will never be disclosed .\nA State spokesman said on July 1 that about two dozen emails in the first tranche released under the Freedom of Information Act contained classified information . But he said he did not know if the information would have been classified at the time .\nLast Friday , the count increased as State released another tranche in which 37 emails had to be cleansed of classified material .\nOn the campaign trail , Mrs. Clinton has been sending this message : \u201c I think there \u2019 s so much confusion around this that I understand why reporters and the public are asking questions , but the facts are pretty clear . I did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time . \u201d\nAfter The New York Times broke the story on the McCullough referral , Mr. Merrill , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s traveling press secretary , sent out a tweet that said : \u201c She followed appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials . As has been reported on multiple occasions , any released emails deemed classified by the administration have been done so after the fact , and not at the time they were transmitted . \u201d\nBut IG McCullough directly contradicts that assertion in his July 23 memo to leaders of Congress \u2019 House and Senate intelligence committees .\n\u201c We note that none of the emails we reviewed had classified or dissemination markings , but some included [ intelligence community- ] derived classified information and should have been handled as classified , appropriately marked and transmitted via a secure network . Further , my office \u2019 s limited sampling of 40 of the emails revealed four contained classified IC information which should have been marked and handled at the SECRET level . \u201d\nA subsequent joint statement by Mr. McCullough and Mr. Linick said : \u201c These emails were not retroactively classified by the State Department ; rather these emails contained classified information when they were generated and , according to IC Classification officials , that information remains classified today . \u201d\nAt a March press conference , Mrs. Clinton asserted she \u201c fully complied with every rule \u201d in maintaining her private server for official business .\nBut the joint IG statement said she did not follow the rules . \u201c This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system , \u201d the two said .\nPreviously , a State Department official appointed by President Obama told a Senate committee that Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email practice was \u201c not acceptable . \u201d\n\u201c I think that the actions we \u2019 ve taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people \u2019 s responsibilities are with respect to record keeping , \u201d Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee . \u201c I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable . \u201d\nState Department bureaucrats appear to be going to bat for Mrs. Clinton in a battle with Mr. McCullough .\n\u2022 Mr. McCullough and the State inspector general asked State to provide a copy of the 30,000 emails .\nState agreed to limited access for the State IG , but flatly refused to provide the emails to Mr. McCullough \u2019 s office .\n\u2022 State already has released classified information in the Clinton emails \u201c as a result of insufficient coordination with the intelligence community. \u201d State personnel \u201c continue to deny the classified character of released information despite a definitive determination from \u201d the intelligence community .\n\u2022 Mr. McCullough \u2019 s office recommended that State conduct the review of 30,000 Clinton emails on a top secret computer network , but State said it does not have sufficient resources .\n\u2022 The 30,000 Clinton emails were downloaded to an unsecure thumb drive in the possession of her personal attorney , David Kendall .\nTo date , State has released only a small portion of those emails in response to a judge \u2019 s order that it quicken the process in response to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on July 1 that the fact the State Department disclosed that some emails contained classified information meant that the government had grounds to launch an inquiry and seize her server .\nThe joint IG statement said , \u201c The IC IG is statutorily required to refer potential compromises of national security information to the appropriate IC security officials . \u201d",
