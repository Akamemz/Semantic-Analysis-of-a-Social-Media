    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A polarized nation is dividing even further into its hardened partisan corners , with Republicans firming up opposition to the House impeachment investigation of President Trump and support growing among Democrats for removing him from office , a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds .\nSome 53 % of Americans in the survey said they approve of the Democratic-run House impeachment inquiry , with 44 % disapproving . Nearly half\u201449 % \u2014said that Mr. Trump should be impeached and removed from the White House based on what they have heard so far , with 46 % opposing impeachment and removal .\nWhen the Journal/NBC News poll asked a similar question in early October , support for impeachment and removal lagged behind opposition , 43 % to 49 % .\nWhile many shifts in the course of October are within the polls \u2019 margins of error , they suggest that Americans are now divided by party over impeachment to the same extensive degree that they are divided over Mr. Trump himself .\nAmong Democrats , support for removing Mr. Trump from office rose to 88 % , up 13 percentage points from early October and in line with the 92 % who disapprove of the president \u2019 s job performance .\nAmong Republicans , opposition to removing Mr. Trump rose to 90 % , up 5 percentage points , and nearly identical to the 91 % who approve of the president \u2019 s performance in office .\nViews of impeachment are only one signal that the election year is unfolding in front of a highly polarized and engaged public . Some 72 % of Americans rate themselves as highly interested in the election\u2014a level normally not seen until the weeks just before Election Day .\nAnother sign of hardened lines appeared when voters were asked about their 2020 choice . Even before knowing the Democratic nominee , some 34 % said they were certain to vote for Mr. Trump , and 46 % said they were certain to vote against him . Only 17 % said their vote depended on which candidate Democrats select to challenge Mr. Trump\u2014a smaller share than the 27 % who said in 2011 their vote depended on which Republican would face then-President Obama .\nInterest in the election is equal among Democrats and Republicans and is high enough to suggest that turnout will break records next year , adding new uncertainties to the outcome , pollsters said . Bill McInturff , a Republican who conducted the survey with Democrat Jeff Horwitt , called it \u201c a supercharged electorate \u2019 \u2019 and said : \u201c When you get an electorate that no one has ever seen , it gets harder to make predictions . \u201d\nMr. Horwitt said the survey finds little sign of political pressure from the Republican base on the GOP senators to remove Mr. Trump from office , should the House vote to impeach . But the poll also points to \u201c a much more challenging road ahead come next November with judges at the ballot box , \u2019 \u2019 he said .\nIn tests against two leading Democratic primary candidates , Mr. Trump trailed former Vice President Joe Biden by 9 percentage points , 41 % to 50 % , and trailed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by 8 points , 42 % to 50 % .\nIn other challenges for Mr. Trump , half of those in the survey said they had no confidence that he has the right goals and policies , with an additional 14 % saying they were \u201c only somewhat confident. \u2019 \u2019 That compared with 35 % who had high levels of confidence in Mr. Trump .\nA majority gave Mr. Trump low marks for serving as commander in chief . A 41 % plurality said Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria was the wrong decision , while 29 % said it was the right call . At the same time , a plurality said the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. military operation last week would make the U.S. safer .\nThe survey found that Mr. Trump does carry strengths into the next election beyond a unified party . Some 52 % of adults said they approved of his handling of the economy , a larger share than the 45 % who approved of his job performance overall .\nTo Mr. McInturff , the survey drew a picture of stability in attitudes toward the president . He pointed out that Mr. Trump \u2019 s approval rating has moved within a narrow , four-point range in 17 of the past 18 Journal/NBC News surveys dating to June of last year , with between 43 % and 46 % of Americans approving of his job performance .\n\u201c Is this impeachment hearing impacting Donald Trump \u2019 s political standing ? The answer to that to date\u2014and I want to answer that emphatically\u2026is no , it \u2019 s not , \u2019 \u2019 Mr. McInturff said . \u201c These are the exact same numbers we \u2019 ve been seeing for a year and a half . \u2019 \u2019\nIndependents take a negative view of how Mr. Trump is handling his job , with 38 % approving and 54 % disapproving . Views of impeachment are more tempered among independents , however , with 43 % saying he should be removed from office and 46 % opposing removal .\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What is your biggest takeway on current public sentiment ? Why ? Join the conversation below .\nOne group that moved more firmly behind the president is Republicans who say they support the GOP itself more than they support Mr. Trump , often called \u201c establishment Republicans. \u201d In surveys , this group often shows lackluster support for some of Mr. Trump \u2019 s policies and distaste for some of his personal qualities . In the new poll , some 11 % of these Republicans said Congress should remove the president from office , down from 21 % in early October .\nThe survey also tracked preferences among voters who said they would participate in a Democratic primary or caucus . Mr. Biden led the field , with 27 % support , followed by Ms. Warren , at 23 % , and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 19 % .\nIn single digits were Pete Buttigieg , with 6 % support ; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , at 5 % , and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 % . Other contenders had less than 4 % support .\nThe results marked a decline in support for Mr. Biden of 4 percentage points from September , and a drop of 2 points for Ms. Warren . Support for Mr. Sanders rose by 5 points from September .\nOf the three leading candidates , Mr. Sanders \u2019 s support appeared to be the most firm . Some 57 % who named him as their top choice for nominee said their support was definite , compared with 50 % of Biden voters and 32 % who favored Ms. Warren .\nMs. Warren led the field , however , when voters were asked their second choice for nominee , suggesting that she would have the most to gain if support for her rivals diminished .\nThe Journal/NBC News survey interviewed 900 adults from Oct. 27-30 .
