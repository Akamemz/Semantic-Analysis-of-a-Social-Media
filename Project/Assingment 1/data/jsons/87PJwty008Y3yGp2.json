Erdogan added that he expected the US to deliver US-made F-35 fighter jets in July as talks between the two countries continue .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Trump told him the US wo n't impose sanctions [ Yuri Kadobnov/Pool/Reuters ]\nWhen asked by a reporter about his ban on US companies selling high-tech components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei , Trump said :\n`` I did agree to allow our companies '' to sell equipment to the firm .\nHuawei is a leader in the latest 5G mobile phone technology . The US says the company is a threat to US national security .\nTrump said China will also be buying more US farm goods .\nTrump was asked by a reporter if he agreed it was `` despicable '' for a government to kill a journalist .\nTrump replied : `` Yes , I do . I think it 's horrible . Or anybody else , by the way . And if you look at Saudi Arabia , you see what 's happening , thirteen people , or so , have been prosecuted . Others are being prosecuted . They 've taken it very , very seriously . And they will continue to . ''\nTrump : US wo n't raise tariffs on Chinese goods for now\nPresident Donald Trump says the US will hold off raising tariffs on more than $ 300bn worth of Chinese goods while negotiations to end the trade war between the two countries continue .\n`` We will be continuing to negotiate . And I promised that for at least the time being , we are not going to be lifting tariffs on China , and we wo n't be adding an additional , I guess we have $ 350bn left which could be taxed , or could be tariffed . And we 're not doing that . We 're going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal , '' Trump said at a news conference at the end of the two-day G20 Summit .\nTrump says he will not raise tariffs on a further $ 350bn worth of Chinese goods for now [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]\nAt the conclusion of the G20 Summit , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the leaders have agreed to principles governing the global economy .\n`` Trade tensions are continuing , and that 's a risk . We have to keep those risks and tensions in mind . Still , we have united in agreeing that we have to lead the world economy , '' Abe said at a news conference .\n`` There is some dissatisfaction between countries . So although there are concerns , what we have to do is establish principles to lead the world economy to the future . Free , fair and inclusive economy and open competition . Those principles have been affirmed between the leaders at this G20 meeting .

''\nBut Choe said that North Korea has yet to receive an official proposal for the DMZ meeting from the US .\nEarlier Saturday , Trump invited Kim to shake hands during his planned visit to the DMZ , which has served as a de-facto border between the Koreas since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War . Trump is scheduled to fly to South Korea later Saturday for a two-day trip after attending the G 20 Summit .\nPresident Trump says he and Turkish President Erdogan were trying to find solutions to Turkey \u2019 s purchase of Russian made S-400 defence missiles , due to be delivered next month .\nThe US has threatened to impose sanctions on his NATO ally because of the purchase but Trump said President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration had placed unfair restrictions on Turkey \u2019 s plan to buy US-made Patriot missiles . Trump said Turkey had turned to Russia because of Obama 's move .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking at different solutions . It \u2019 s a problem there \u2019 s no question of about it , \u201d Trump said .\nTrump also said he would visit NATO ally Turkey some time in the future .\nAfter a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Trump says they 're looking for solutions around Turkey 's purchase of Russian missiles [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]\nChinese state media : US wo n't levy new tariffs on Chinese exports\nThe Xinhua news agency is reporting that the US has agreed to not levy new tariffs on Chinese exports following talks between the two countries ' leaders .\nChina and the US have agreed to restart trade talks and will have discussions on specific issues , Xinhua said .\nAfter a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , US President Donald Trump says relations between the two countries are `` back on track '' after a breakdown in trade talks last month .\n`` We had a very , very good meeting with China . I would say probably even better than expected . The negotiations are continuing , '' Trump told reporters .\nHe said both sides will be making statements later on Saturday .\nThe meeting between the two has been seen by analysts and economists as the most important of the G20 Summit . They say a failure to agree on ways to ratchet down the US-China trade dispute could have dire consequences for the world economy .\nIn a joint press conference with representatives of France and the United Nations , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for urgent action to address climate change .\n`` In our view climate change concerns the future of mankind , '' he said , `` so our generation needs to make the right choice . All countries need to step up to the plate and deliver on their commitments in the Paris Agreement to the full extent . ''\nHe added : `` We must promote green infrastructure , green investment , and green financing . We look forward to working with like-minded parties to build a green Silk Road to achieve high-quality development and to leave behind a clean and beautiful world for future generations . ''\nBut these are rare words of support for fighting climate change during the G20 Summit .\nWhile French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged not to sign any G20 statement that leaves out any reference to the 2015 Paris deal on combatting climate change , he \u2019 s up against the US , which is trying to stifle any mention of it . Under pressure from the US , Japan is on course to leave out references to global warming in the final communique .\nMeanwhile G20 countries have increased their annual spending on coal-fired plants to $ 64bn , according to a report by the Overseas Development Institute . It also says G20 nations have tripled subsidies for the industry in recent years .\nSlipping away ? US-China trade deal appears elusive at G20 summit\nDeal or no deal ?

I actually think we were very close \u2026 something happened where it slipped a little bit and now we \u2019 re getting a little bit closer , but it would be historic if we could do a fair trade deal . We \u2019 re totally open to it and I know you \u2019 re totally open to it . I think we can go on to do something that would be truly be monumental and great for both countries and that \u2019 s what I look forward to doing . ''\nThe most highly anticipated event of this year \u2019 s G20 Summit is under way . US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting to discuss their ongoing trade dispute .\nBefore their meeting they made brief statements to the media .\nXi reminded Trump about the history of modern relations between China and the US , starting with a table tennis tournament between American and Chinese players in the 1970s which paved the way for formal diplomatic relations which began in 1979 .\n\u201c The small ball played a big role in moving world events , \u201d Xi said .\n\u201c Forty years on , enormous change has taken place in the international situation and China-US relations , \u201d Xi said .\n\u201c But one basic fact remains unchanged . China and the United States both benefit from cooperation and lose in a confrontation . Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation . \u201d\nThe big event of the G20 Summit is under way . China 's President Xi Jinping reminded Trump of the history of relations between their countries before trade talks begin [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]\nSpeaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588 's programme Inside Story , Aly-Khan Satchu , economist and CEO of Rich Management , an investment advisory company in Kenya , thinks that both Presidents Trump and Xi are n't in the mood to compromise .\n`` Overwhelming the summit is this gladiatorial combat between President Trump and Xi Jinping is the trade war , the tariff war . Essentially the direction of the global economy is going to be driven by whether these two can have a truce .\n`` Both of whom are going to be unable to reconcile \u2026 . Trump is a train driver but the train tracks have been set and he can either speed it up or slow it down . Xi , the paramount leader \u2026 the nature of paramount leaders and you \u2019 re up on a pedestal and everyone can point at you and he can \u2019 t compromise either .\n`` And while everyone \u2019 s talking about a big fat agenda , let \u2019 s make no mistake - this is about the two superpowers and about whether they can come to some kind of resolution . The direction of travel is much more adversarial and we should read the signs for what they are . ''\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 's James Bays says the big event of the G20 Summit is the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping .\n`` The big discussions are going to be about trade . And this is absolutely central , I think , to the mission of the G20 , which is about the world \u2019 s economic outlook because many are worried about the ongoing trade war between the US and China , '' says Bays .\n`` Since May , trade negotiations broke down . Things could get worse or better . Trump , again , has been trumpeting about the state of the US stock market . But of course , the US stock market depends on the global economy . And economists are watching very , very closely what happens at this meeting . And they fear , in a worst-case scenario , if the trade war were to get worse , then it could tank the whole global economy . ''\nUS President Donald Trump held a working breakfast with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , also known as MBS , at a hotel in Osaka .\nNeither of them answered questions about the investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia 's consulate in Istanbul last year .\nTrump heaped praise on MBS , saying it was `` a great honour '' to meet with him and described Saudi Arabia as `` a good purchaser of American products . '' Turning to MBS , Trump added , `` You 've done a really spectacular job . ''\nNeither Trump nor Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , attending a working breakfast , answered questions about the investigation into Jamal Khashoggi 's murder [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]\nUS President Donald Trump began the second day of the G20 Summit by shifting the focus to the Korean Peninsula . In an early morning tweet he wrote :\n`` After some very important meetings , including my meeting with President Xi of China , I will be leaving Japan for South Korea ( with President Moon ) . While there , if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this , I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello ( ? ) !

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 28 , 2019\nIt did not appear that US officials had warned North Korea in advance about Trump 's unexpected offer of a meeting , and it was n't clear whether or not such a meeting would prove feasible .\nJapan 's Nikkei newspaper is reporting that the G20 leaders will agree to accelerate World Trade Organization ( WTO ) reforms but stop short of calling for the need to resist protectionism in a communique to be issued on Saturday .\nThe G20 members broadly agreed on the need to accelerate stalled WTO reforms in Friday 's session on global growth and trade , a Japanese government official told reporters , according to the Reuters news agency .\nInstead of a pledge to resist protectionism , Japan is working with other G20 nations to urge members to promote a `` free , fair and non-discriminatory '' trade policy , the paper said . The proposal has been endorsed by several members already , it said without citing sources .\nThe G20 leaders will release the communique after they wrap up their two-day meeting on Saturday .\nIt will be the second straight G20 summit in which members forgo pledging the need to denounce protectionism . The language on protectionism was removed at last year 's summit in Buenos Aires , nodding to a request by Washington which is sensitive to criticism of the tariffs it is slapping on some G20 members .\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped the US and China would make some progress towards defusing their ongoing trade dispute .\nGermany 's export-oriented economy is extremely exposed to , and already suffering from , the impact of soured trade relations between the world 's largest and second-largest economies .\nMerkel said in a statement that she had discussed trade in her bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump , who has taken to task both Beijing and Berlin , two of the world 's main exporters , on the issue .\n`` We hope that discussions between China and the U.S. on the margins of this conference will , along with other talks , perhaps lead to successes , '' she told reporters .\nTrump holds a bilateral meeting with Merkel at the G20 leaders summit [ Kevin Lamarque/Reuters ]\nAn exiled advocate for China 's ethnic Uighur minority urged world leaders to act to prevent the disappearance of his people 's culture .\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Osaka meeting , Rebiya Kadeer said strong world pressure was essential to free an estimated one million people , mostly ethnic Uighurs , held in internment camps in western China .\n`` ( The ) entire Uighur people are facing ( an ) existential threat , and it 's real and urgent , '' Kadeer , the 72-year-old head of the World Uyghur Congress , said through an interpreter . `` I call ( on ) European countries who are economically dependent on China to wake up and stand up against Chinese genocide of Uighurs and take practical actions immediately . ''\nChinese officials describe the camps as voluntary `` vocational education centres '' where Turkic-speaking Uighurs receive job training .\nKadeer 's presence in Osaka will no doubt anger China , which labels her a dangerous separatist and has previously condemned Japan for allowing her entry .\nTrump prepares for 'productive ' talks with Xi on trade war\nUS President Donald Trump said he hoped for productive talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a trade war that is casting a shadow on global growth , but added he had not made any promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs .\nConcerns remain that an agreement will not be reached between China and the US .\n`` At a minimum , it will be productive , '' Trump said of the meeting with Xi .\n`` We 'll see what happens and what comes out of it , '' Trump told reporters after a series of meetings with leaders where he made clear his priority was two-way trade deals to boost the US economy .\nAsked , however , if he had promised Xi a six-month reprieve on imposing new tariffs on a $ 300bn list of Chinese imports , Trump said : `` No . ''\nChina hopes US can meet it halfway in G20 talks\nChina 's Foreign Ministry expressed hope Washington can `` meet China halfway '' as President Xi prepares to meet Trump amid a costly tariff fight over trade and technology .\nInvestors are hoping for a repeat of Trump and Xi 's December agreement to postpone new tariff hikes and other action while they tried to negotiate a settlement . But analysts caution any truce at the G20 is likely to be temporary because of the array of disputes that separate the two sides .\nThe two sides are in a stalemate after 11 rounds of talks . Beijing has said any agreement must be balanced and rejects US complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology .\n`` We hope that the US can meet China halfway and work together with us to promote a positive result from the meeting , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said . `` This is in the interest of both countries and also meets the common expectation of the international community . ''\nLeaders of Russia , India and China have urged joint action against unilateralism .\nMeeting on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit , Russian President Vladimir Putin , China 's Xi , and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about ways to bolster ties between their nations .\nPutin emphasised the three countries agreed on the need to rely on international law , respect national sovereignty , and refrain from interference in internal affairs of other nations .\nHe added they held meetings with foreign ministers and top security officials to coordinate action against terrorism , drug trafficking and other challenges .\nPutin noted Russia , China and India firmly oppose protectionism , unilateral actions , and unlawful sanctions .\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May told Putin that Russia must end its `` irresponsible and destabilising activity '' if relations between the two countries , soured by the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil , were to improve .\nMay also told the Russian president during their G20 meeting she wanted the two Russians that the United Kingdom says is responsible for the attack on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year brought to justice .\n`` The prime minister said that the use of a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Salisbury formed part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour and was a truly despicable act that led to the death of a British citizen , Dawn Sturgess , '' a statement from her office said .\n`` [ She ] underlined that we remain open to a different relationship , but for that to happen the Russian government must choose a different path . ''\nIn a meeting with President Xi , Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought up the issue of the ongoing protests against a proposed law in Hong Kong that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China .\nAbe said it was important to preserve the territory 's freedoms for it to `` prosper under 'one country , two systems ' policy .

And certainly , if you were to speak privately to military commanders in the US , they say they are deeply concerned about Russia , and Russia 's threats in Ukraine , Russia 's involvement in Syria , Russia trying to pull out of some treaties governing nuclear relations between the two .\n`` It is a tense time , but not a tense relationship , it seems , between the two leaders . ''\nOver the clatter of photographers ' cameras , a reporter asked Trump if he was going to tell Putin not to meddle in US elections in the future . Trump replied : `` Yes , of course , I will . '' He then turned to Putin with a smile and said , `` Do n't meddle with the election , please !

He 's played bad cop with Japan and India on security issues and on trade issues .

Things could get worse or better. Trump, again, has been trumpeting about the state of the US stock market. But of course, the US stock market depends on the global economy.
