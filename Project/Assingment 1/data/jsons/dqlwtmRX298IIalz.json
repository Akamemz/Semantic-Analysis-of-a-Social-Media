John McCain and Lindsey Graham \u2014 were working with senators from both parties to draft an immigration bill , top Rubio hands flatly warned the Florida freshman not to go there . The advisers feared nothing would be worse for his chances in a potential presidential campaign than being associated with \u201c amnesty \u201d for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally .\nRubio didn \u2019 t take the advice . And two years later , immigration remains the freshman senator \u2019 s No . 1 liability in his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination \u2014 though not necessarily the deal breaker it appeared to be after the reform effort Rubio helped shepherd to passage in the Senate hit a brick wall in the House .\n\u201c Everybody likes Marco Rubio , \u201d said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace , a nationally syndicated commentator . But \u201c I still don \u2019 t hear his name from conservatives at all , and I think the Gang of Eight \u201d \u2014 the bipartisan group of senators that pushed the most sweeping immigration overhaul in a generation \u2014 \u201c has a lot to do with that . \u201d\nEven so , the political damage to Rubio has clearly subsided over time , in no small part due to Rubio \u2019 s repeated disavowal of the entire reform exercise . In the days ahead of his presidential campaign launch in Miami Monday evening , some critics on the tea party right concede he has resuscitated himself politically , though the true effect may not be apparent until much deeper into the 2016 primary season .\n\u201c What I think everyone over here underestimated is how difficult it is to pass massive pieces of legislation on any subject \u2014 not just immigration \u2014 given the rightful distrust the people have about the federal government , \u201d Rubio said in a recent interview in the Capitol .\nSaid Jenny Beth Martin , the president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots : \u201c I think that Sen. Rubio has done something that most politicians don \u2019 t do : He evaluated what went wrong \u2026 [ and ] is working to make sure he doesn \u2019 t make the same mistakes again . I think that neutralizes his mistakes . \u201d\nStill , even if immigration won \u2019 t be a central message of his presidential campaign , it will be an inescapable part of his record and his own personal narrative . The son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio announced his presidential run at the Freedom Tower in Miami \u2014 an Ellis Island of the South that served as a welcoming point for Cuban exiles into America .\nThe issue is also bound to be re-litigated by his opponents and voters , as it has during early appearances this year at a New Hampshire town hall and Iowa book signing . When pressed on the matter on the campaign trail , Rubio plans to tell voters that the comprehensive bill he co-authored will never pass Congress .\nIn his latest book , \u201c American Dreams , \u201d Rubio argues that the approach he took in 2013 on immigration \u2014 one single bill to reform the entire system \u2014 was \u201c simply not realistic. \u201d He can assert that , Rubio says , because he knows of the experience firsthand .\n\u201c Every massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous , \u201d Rubio said in the interview .\nInstead , Rubio is renewing an argument he made originally that Congress should take up immigration reform in pieces , starting with proposals that Republicans largely support such as enforcement at the southern border , a mandatory electronic system to verify the legal status of employees and a new method to track people who overstay their visas . He \u2019 ll argue that deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally is improbable , and call for an onerous series of steps to allow some to stay in the country . And a President Rubio would only entertain that possibility of citizenship after a enforcement-minded immigration laws are enacted first .\nSuch talk \u2014 and his decision to back away away from his own bill \u2014 seem to have alleviated some concern on the right that Rubio is not another McCain or Graham .\nYet it \u2019 s also opened him to charges that the GOP lawmaker flip-flopped on the issue when the political temperature got too hot \u2013 simply to pander to the base of the party , and potentially leaving himself vulnerable to Latino voters in a general election .\nIn June 2013 , the same month that his immigration bill passed the Senate , a Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that his \u201c strongly favorable \u201d ratings among Republicans had tumbled by 11 points since the previous August .\nRubio began to make amends with conservatives . Immediately after the bill passed the chamber , he shifted his attention to a range of economic reforms and other matters . He refused to call on the GOP-led House to pass the Senate bill , even as the other seven co-authors planned an aggressive public pressure campaign on House Republicans .\nRubio blamed President Barack Obama for scuttling the bill \u2019 s chances , saying no conservative trusts the White House to implement the border control provisions . Republicans in the House agreed .\nHis shift to the right didn \u2019 t stop there . At the height of last summer \u2019 s border crisis , Rubio called for the 2012 Obama administration program that halts deportations of young undocumented immigrants \u2014 an initiative highly popular with Latinos \u2014 to eventually end .\nCritics say his handling of immigration feeds the perception that Rubio lacks any significant legislative accomplishments in his short time in the Senate . And immigration activists who were once impressed with Rubio for taking on the politically fraught task of writing a reform bill now see him as a sell-out .\n\u201c Every time he gets on his knees and begs for forgiveness from the nativist right in the GOP , I cringe , \u201d said Frank Sharry , a veteran immigration advocate who leads America \u2019 s Voice , a left-leaning , pro-reform group . \u201c He will always be known as the guy who stood up for something he seemed to believe in and backed down when it was politically convenient to do so . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s unclear how Rubio would fare among Latino voters if he were to win the GOP nomination . The polling firm Latino Decisions found in a November survey of Latino voters that Rubio is viewed favorably by 31 percent of Latinos vs. 36 percent who saw him unfavorably . About one-third of those voters had not heard of Rubio , or had any opinion on the senator .\nDespite concerns for some on the right , public polls show the senator still has a serious chance to win a wide-open race . A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from March showed that 56 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Rubio \u2014 a higher figure than received by any other of the 13 GOP contenders listed by the poll .\nPerhaps that \u2019 s because Rubio has moved to ensure he \u2019 s not identified strictly with the immigration issue . He \u2019 s been laying out economic reform ideas , from making higher education more affordable to helping narrow the income gap . At the same time , he has maintained his staunchly conservative views on social issues and foreign policy .\n\u201c I \u2019 m struck by how much he has recovered , \u201d said Weekly Standard editor William Kristol , who two years ago advised Rubio to \u201c walk away \u201d from the Gang of Eight .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to put your finger on it , but there do seem to be some politicians whom lots of voters want to like and are eager to forgive for their mistakes , \u201d Kristol said , citing Ronald Reagan as an example . \u201c Others who are less likable get held to a stricter standard . So Rubio \u2019 s apparent comeback over the last couple of years may indicate a kind of underlying strength there that one might not have expected . \u201d\nYet , Rubio is still likely to be the left of the likes of Ted Cruz when it comes to immigration reform .\nIn \u201c American Dreams , \u201d Rubio said he would address immigrants already here illegally once Congress has passed enforcement proposals and turned the current legal immigration system into one based on merit and economic considerations , not family ties .\nAt that point , he said he would institute a system to register those here illegally , deporting ones who have committed serious crimes or who have not been in the United States long enough . Undocumented immigrants who pay a fine , learn English and undergo background checks could then obtain a temporary legal status , something they would have to hold for at least 10 years before applying for permanent residence .\nRubio said he would not create a so-called special pathway , meaning a way to obtain citizenship that isn \u2019 t afforded to other immigrants . That highly contentious provision \u2014 to provide a pathway to citizenship \u2014 was included in the Gang of Eight proposal .\n\u201c He not going to run away from it , he \u2019 s going to talk about it , \u201d said Alfonso Aguilar , executive director of the American Principles Project \u2019 s Latino Partnership , a group that advocates for conservative causes among Latinos . \u201c He \u2019 s going to continue to say that it \u2019 s important to deal with the issue . \u201d\nAguilar , who has lobbied GOP lawmakers on immigration reform , said Rubio should have tried harder to recruit other conservative Republicans to the Gang of Eight so he wasn \u2019 t the sole emissary charged with selling the bill to the right .
