    "content": "The NBA finds itself caught between two cultures after a tweet about Hong Kong protests sparked criticism from China that threatens the U.S. basketball league \u2019 s expansion efforts in its most important international market .\nThe controversy erupted after Daryl Morey , general manager of the Houston Rockets , one of the most popular U.S. basketball teams in China , appeared to support Hong Kong demonstrators in a tweet late Friday . While the message was deleted and both Morey and the National Basketball Association tried to distance themselves from it , the damage reverberated across both China and the U.S .\nFor the Chinese , the incident is seen as the latest example of a Western organization challenging the nation \u2019 s sovereignty over its territory . In the U.S. , meanwhile , the NBA \u2019 s response was met with scorching bipartisan criticism from politicians including Senator Ted Cruz . The situation puts the league at risk of either offending fans in its biggest international market , or exposing itself to charges of kowtowing to China at the expense of American values .\n\u201c Chinese Rockets fans are first Chinese . We love Chinese red more than Rockets red , \u201d Kang Hui , an anchor for CCTV News Channel , said in a video on an official CCTV Weibo account . \u201c Morey , this time you really fouled . If you foul , you have to pay the price . \u201d\nAt stake is a business that has been notching double-digit growth in China every year since 2008 . The league has achieved the kind of success there that other international sports leagues covet . About 800 million Chinese watch NBA programming on TV , digital media or smartphones in a season , with top games attracting more viewers than in the U.S .\nThe NBA has a host of licensing and retail deals in China , including a $ 500 million pact with Tencent Holdings Ltd. and a 30-plus-years partnership with state-run broadcaster CCTV . Tencent has seen Internet viewership of NBA games nearly triple over the past four years .\nThe fallout was swift following Morey \u2019 s tweet , which contained an image that read \u201c Fight for Freedom . Stand with Hong Kong. \u201d Chinese sportswear maker Li Ning Co. and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center suspended cooperation with the Rockets , while CCTV and Tencent said they will halt broadcasting the team \u2019 s games .\nSearches for Rockets gear on Chinese e-commerce sites operated by JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. didn \u2019 t return any results on Monday .\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China . I was merely voicing one thought , based on one interpretation , of one complicated event . I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives . \u2014 Daryl Morey ( @ dmorey ) October 7 , 2019\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention . My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA . \u2014 Daryl Morey ( @ dmorey ) October 7 , 2019\nThe NBA is just the latest international business feeling the heat from the standoff between pro-democracy demonstrators and Hong Kong authorities that has escalated since June .
