Sorry ! \u2014 FactCheck.org ( @ factcheckdotorg ) September 27 , 2016\n10:20 p.m. EDT : Lester Holt bows to the Clinton campaign , and tries to \u201c fact-check \u201d Trump on his support for ( or opposition to ) the Iraq War .\nIt happens thus : Holt introduces , matter-of-factly , the premise that Trump supported the Iraq War . Trump pushes back , calling it \u201c mainstream media nonsense. \u201d Trump burns two minutes explaining how he did not support the war , citing Howard Stern and Sean Hannity .\nAt the end , Holt repeats the allegation again anyway . This is what the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media wanted him to do .\nIn one gesture , Holt proves everything that conservatives allege about mainstream media moderators , NBC News , and \u201c fact-checking . \u201d\n10:07 p.m. EDT : The self-proclaimed fact-checkers join moderator Lester Holt and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for a real-time demonstration of how so-called \u201c fact-checking \u201d is really a guise for deliberate political attacks .\nStep 1 : Moderator asks setup question . In a segment on race relations , Holt asks Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory . He asks no similar questions about Clinton \u2019 s record , leaving Trump himself to bring up such Clinton hits as \u201c superpredator. \u201d Trump also notes that the Birther conspiracy theory started in the Clinton campaign . Step 2 : Democrat pounces on setup question . Clinton goes to town on Trump \u2019 s Birther past , denying her own . Trump counters , again , with examples of racism from Clinton \u2019 s 2008 campaign . But then\u2026 Step 2a : Moderator interrupts Trump \u2019 s response . Holt reminds Trump that the segment is about race relations . Just to reinforce the underlying charge of racism . Step 3 : Fact-checker gives Trump a \u201c false. \u201d PolitiFact tweets a link to an article from Sep. 16 claiming that neither Clinton nor her campaign had anything to do with the Birther conspiracy theory . Of course they did , as Clinton \u2019 s campaign manager admitted . Trump points that out \u2014 and perhaps that is effective , but the point is that the left \u2019 s so-called \u201c fact-checking \u201d machine completes the cycle .\nTo review : Moderator sets up attack , Democrat attacks , fact-checker removes Republican \u2019 s defense .\n9:58 p.m. EDT : Trump fact-checks Clinton when she claims crime is down in New York , including murder .\nTrump is right . Crime was down overall in New York last year , but murder , rape , and robbery were up , according to the Wall Street Journal .\nHolt : Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York\u2026 Trump : No , you \u2019 re wrong . It went before a judge , who was a very against-police judge . It was taken away from her and our mayor , our new mayor , refused to go forward with the case .\nFact Wreck rating : Trump is 100 % right , according to the New York Times and Holt \u2019 s collusion with Clinton is becoming hard to ignore .\n9:47 p.m. EDT : The left \u2019 s pressure on moderator Lester Holt seems to have worked , as he raises the question of Trump \u2019 s tax returns ( not yet disclosed ) but says nothing about Clinton \u2019 s missing emails , leaving that to Trump to raise on his own .\nFactCheck.org does not bother to fact-check Hillary Clinton \u2019 s false rebuttal , which is that she made a \u201c mistake \u201d ( which she originally claimed was a mistake of using only one phone , when she in fact had 13 ) . Instead , the organization simply refers to a \u201c guide \u201d to Hillary \u2019 s emails .\n9:25 p.m. EDT : Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both refer viewers to fact-checking services on their campaign websites .\nThe media fact-checkers are about to go out of business .\n9:22 p.m. EDT : Hillary Clinton fact-checks Donald Trump , after he says that she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership before she opposed it .\nClinton : That is just not accurate . I was against it once it was finally negotiated\u2026 Trump : \u2026You called it the gold standard of trade deals . You said it \u2019 s the finest deal you \u2019 d ever seen. \u201d Clinton : No .\nActually , she did . CNN ( ! ) counted 45 times Clinton pushed the deal .\nPolitiFact notes that Clinton did , indeed , flip-flop on the deal :\nLIVE FACT-CHECK : Trump is right , Clinton flip-flopped on TPP https : //t.co/howNkUisAE pic.twitter.com/V70SDG3MAY \u2014 PolitiFact Live ( @ politifactlive ) September 27 , 2016\n9:18 p.m. EDT : Donald Trump fact-checks Hillary Clinton . She said : \u201c Donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. \u201d He denied it .\nHe did , in fact , tweet in 2012 that the Chinese invented the concept of \u201c global warming \u201d for their own benefit . He later said he was joking .\n9:16 p.m. EDT : FactCheck.org has two fact checks so far , both of Trump . And not because Hillary \u2019 s been more truthful .\nThus far , the 1st factual error in # debatenight is @ HillaryClinton saying the US doesn \u2019 t yet have \u201c equal pay for equal work. \u201d Fact-checkers ? \u2014 Joel B. Pollak ( @ joelpollak ) September 27 , 2016\n9:12 p.m. EDT : Alex Burns of the New York Times files the first fact check of the evening , complaining about Trump \u2019 s claims about Ford moving jobs to Mexico . But Burns \u2014 and , thus far , the rest of the fact-checkers \u2014 missed the actual first false statement by any of the candidates .\nThe whopper came from Clinton , who suggested that the U.S. does not yet have \u201c equal pay for equal work , \u201d something that has been a matter of law for decades . ( The remaining inequality , such as it is , is largely due to factors such as career choice and time off for children . )\n8:58 p.m. EDT : FactCheck.org calls NBC News host Lester Holt a \u201c moderate. \u201d It \u2019 s just a typo , but why not ?\nModerate Lester Holt says that hopefully it will be \u201c just the two of them tonight , \u201d and he will facilitate the discussion . \u2014 FactCheck.org ( @ factcheckdotorg ) September 27 , 2016\nActually , Holt \u2019 s political affiliation has been a part of the pre-debate controversy . Trump called Holt a Democrat ; he is actually a registered Republican . ( Fun fact : Fox News \u2019 Chris Wallace is apparently a registered Democrat . ) According to political scientist Tim Groseclose , more than 90 % of political journalists are registered Democrats , while some 7 % identify as Republican .\nOver the past several years , mainstream media outlets have introduced \u201c fact check \u201d services to respond to statements by politicians during election season and debates .\nOstensibly , \u201c fact-checking \u201d aims to help the public make more informed decisions , both by helping them see past the candidates \u2019 political spin , and by helping them see which candidates are more truthful . In practice , \u201c fact-checking \u201d is weighted against Republicans , largely because fact-checkers evaluate Republicans more than Democrats .\nWhen fact-checkers do scrutinize Democrats , the party of the left often enjoys the benefit of the doubt . For example , when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton first faced questions about whether she used her secret private email server to send or receive classified material , the Washington Post gave her a mere two Pinocchios ( out of four ) when she claimed she had not . For months , evidence mounted that Clinton had lied . Only when FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton had , indeed , exchanged classified material through her email server \u2014 while declining to prosecute her for the same \u2014 did the Post upgrade its rating from two to four Pinocchios .\nConversely , fact-checkers often punish Republicans for statements that are factually correct . For example , Politifact rated as \u201c false \u201d a statement by Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-AR ) claiming that President Barack Obama had promised to dismantle Iran \u2019 s nuclear program . But Cotton \u2019 s statement was , in fact , completely accurate .\nIn the run-up to Monday \u2019 s first presidential debate , Democrats and media pundits have urged moderator Lester Holt to fact-check Republican nominee Donald Trump during the debate . It is dubious advice , given the disastrous precedent of CNN \u2019 s Candy Crowley , who erroneously fact-checked Republican Mitt Romney during the second debate in 2012 . The pressure has another purpose , which is to cast Trump as more dishonest than Clinton .\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
