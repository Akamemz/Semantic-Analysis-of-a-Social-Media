Bush , 43 % unfavorable . When Bush left office in 2009 , only about one-third of Americans said they had a positive opinion of him . This new poll presents a notable shift as Bush 's overall favorability has remained well below 50 % for much of his time as a presidential alum .\nOverall , 47 % say things in the country are going well , 52 % that they 're going badly .
