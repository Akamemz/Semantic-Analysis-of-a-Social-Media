This could happen as early as six months after enactment of the bill .\nThey would remain in that provisional status for 10 years , able to work legally but barred from federal benefits like welfare or health care . After 10 years they could seek green cards conferring permanent legal status , provided the security and fencing plans have been `` substantially '' carried out . After another three years , those immigrants could petition for citizenship .\nIn total , the bill creates a minimum 13-year path to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants , costing them each $ 2,000 in fines plus additional fees . Applicants would have to meet other criteria as well in order to qualify .\nIt 's unclear whether the border security `` triggers '' will be enough to satisfy skeptical lawmakers . The bill outline establishes numeric goals for border apprehensions , but it 's unclear how closely meeting -- or missing -- those goals is tied to the pathway to legal status .\nConservatives say border security improvements should be verified before illegal immigrants can seek citizenship .
