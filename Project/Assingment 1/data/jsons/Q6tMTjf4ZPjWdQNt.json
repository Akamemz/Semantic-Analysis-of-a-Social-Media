    "content": "Jordan Edwards , 15 , was trying to leave a house party that had gotten out of control on Saturday . But the black teenager would never get home that night \u2014 because , as he sat in a car , a police officer shot and killed him .\nNow , the officer involved in the shooting , Roy Oliver , has been charged with murder , with a judge signing an arrest warrant earlier on Friday . Oliver had already been fired earlier this week , because , police said , he \u201c violated several departmental policies . \u201d\nPolice in Balch Springs , Texas , a majority-minority Dallas suburb , originally claimed there was an altercation with the vehicle . Edwards , who was unarmed , was sitting in the front passenger \u2019 s seat , with four other unarmed teens , including Edwards \u2019 s brother , in the car , according to family attorney Lee Merritt .\nOliver shot at the car with a rifle . A bullet broke through the front passenger \u2019 s window and hit Edwards . Shortly after , Edwards was rushed to a hospital , where he died from gunshot injuries . No officers were injured in the incident .\nBalch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber at first said the car backed up toward responding officers \u201c in an aggressive manner . \u201d\nAfter his original statement , however , Haber said on Monday that he \u201c misspoke. \u201d He clarified that the car was in fact driving away from officers , not toward them . He added , \u201c After reviewing video , I don \u2019 t believe that it [ the shooting ] met our core values . \u201d\nNeighbors told local reporter Gabriel Roxas that the party Edwards left was crowded , with unsupervised , drunk teens fighting before gunshots were fired . According to the family attorney , Edwards \u201c was leaving a house party because he thought it was getting dangerous . \u201d\nEdwards \u2019 s coaches and community members reportedly attended a press conference demanding answers for the shooting . Mesquite Independent School District , where Edwards was a freshman in high school , said in a statement that he was \u201c a good student who was very well liked by his teachers , coaches , and his fellow students. \u201d Edwards played football at the school , and one of his teammates called him \u201c the best running back I ever played with . \u201d\nDallas County officials are investigating the shooting . Investigators are currently reviewing body camera footage , but the video hasn \u2019 t been released to the public yet .\nThe shooting has drawn scrutiny around the country , with the death of a black 15-year-old boy at the hands of police becoming just the latest example of the racial disparities in police use of force that have garnered national attention after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , in August 2014 .\nBlack people are much more likely to be killed by police than their white peers\nBased on nationwide data collected by the Guardian , black Americans are more than twice as likely as their white counterparts to be killed by police when accounting for population . In 2016 , police killed black Americans at a rate of 6.66 per 1 million people , compared to 2.9 per 1 million for white Americans .\nThere have also been several high-profile police killings since 2014 involving black suspects . In Baltimore , six police officers were indicted for the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody . In North Charleston , South Carolina , Michael Slager was charged with murder and fired from the police department after shooting Walter Scott , who was fleeing and unarmed at the time . In Ferguson , Darren Wilson killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown . In New York City , NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner by putting the unarmed 43-year-old black man in a chokehold .\nOne possible explanation for the racial disparities : Police tend to patrol high-crime neighborhoods , which are disproportionately black . That means they \u2019 re going to be generally more likely to initiate a policing action , from traffic stops to more serious arrests , against a black person who lives in these areas . And all of these policing actions carry a chance , however small , to escalate into a violent confrontation .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that higher crime rates in black communities explain the entire racial disparity in police shootings . A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found , \u201c There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates ( even race-specific crime rates ) , meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates. \u201d That suggests something else \u2014 such as , potentially , racial bias \u2014 is going on .\nOne reason to believe racial bias is a factor : Studies show that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations . Josh Correll , a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research , said it \u2019 s possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field . \u201c In the very situation in which [ officers ] most need their training , \u201d he said , \u201c we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them . \u201d\nPart of the solution to potential bias is better training that helps cops acknowledge and deal with their potential prejudices . But critics also argue that more accountability could help deter future brutality or excessive use of force , since it would make it clear that there are consequences to the misuse and abuse of police powers . Yet right now , lax legal standards make it difficult to legally punish individual police officers for use of force , even when it might be excessive .\nPolice only have to reasonably perceive a threat to justify shooting\nLegally , what most matters in police shootings is whether police officers reasonably believed that their lives were in immediate danger , not whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat .\nIn the 1980s , a pair of Supreme Court decisions \u2014 Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor \u2014 set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable .\nConstitutionally , \u201c police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances , \u201d David Klinger , a University of Missouri St. Louis professor who studies use of force , previously told Dara Lind for \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The first circumstance is \u201c to protect their life or the life of another innocent party \u201d \u2014 what departments call the \u201c defense-of-life \u201d standard . The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping , but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others .\nThe logic behind the second circumstance , Klinger said , comes from a Supreme Court decision called Tennessee v. Garner . That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary . ( He \u2019 d stolen $ 10 and a purse from a house . ) The court ruled that cops couldn \u2019 t shoot every felon who tried to escape . But , as Klinger said , \u201c they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence , and if you \u2019 ve got a violent person who \u2019 s fleeing , you can shoot them to stop their flight . \u201d\nThe key to both of the legal standards \u2014 defense of life and fleeing a violent felony \u2014 is that it doesn \u2019 t matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used . Instead , what matters is the officer \u2019 s \u201c objectively reasonable \u201d belief that there is a threat .\nThat standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions : Graham v. Connor . This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who \u2019 d survived his encounter with police officers , but who \u2019 d been treated roughly , had his face shoved into the hood of a car , and broken his foot \u2014 all while he was suffering a diabetic attack .\nThe court didn \u2019 t rule on whether the officers \u2019 treatment of him had been justified , but it did say that the officers couldn \u2019 t justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good . They had to demonstrate that their actions were \u201c objectively reasonable , \u201d given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do .\nWhat \u2019 s \u201c objectively reasonable \u201d changes as the circumstances change . \u201c One can \u2019 t just say , \u2018 Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago , that means I can use deadly force again now , \u2019 \u201d Walter Katz , a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies , previously said .\nIn general , officers are given lot of legal latitude to use force without fear of punishment . The intention behind these legal standards is to give police officers leeway to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and bystanders . And although critics argue that these legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people , police officers say they are essential to their safety .\nFor some critics , the question isn \u2019 t what \u2019 s legally justified but rather what \u2019 s preventable . \u201c We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable . Most are preventable , \u201d Ronald Davis , a former police chief who previously headed the Justice Department \u2019 s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services , told the Washington Post . Police \u201c need to stop chasing down suspects , hopping fences , and landing on top of someone with a gun , \u201d he added . \u201c When they do that , they have no choice but to shoot . ''\nPolice are very rarely prosecuted for shootings \u2014 and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job . Sometimes the investigations fall onto the same police department the officer is from , which creates major conflicts of interest . Other times the only available evidence comes from eyewitnesses , who may not be as trustworthy in the public eye as a police officer .\n\u201c There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian , in terms of credibility , \u201d David Rudovsky , a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote Prosecuting Misconduct : Law and Litigation , previously told Amanda Taub for \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c And when an officer is on trial , reasonable doubt has a lot of bite . A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction . \u201d\nIf police are charged , they \u2019 re very rarely convicted . The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3,238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010 . They found that only 33 percent were convicted , and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences . Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated .\nThe statistics suggest that it would have been a truly rare situation if the officer who shot and killed Edwards was charged and convicted of a crime .",
