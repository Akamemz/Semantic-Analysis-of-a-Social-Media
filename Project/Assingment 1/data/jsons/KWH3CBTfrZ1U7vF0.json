Democrats use it at the drop of a MAGA hat .\n\u201c They use that word for everything now , \u201d said rally attendee Johnny Liles of Emerald Isle , North Carolina .\nVoters in Massachusetts \u2019 7th Congressional District had a very different view .\nThe 7th is represented by Ayanna Pressley , one of the congresswomen Mr. Trump referred to , and almost all of her constituents interviewed thought the tweet was racist \u2013 self-evidently so .\nMany asked how anybody could doubt that \u201c they \u201d referred to black and brown people . The \u201c go back \u201d trope , long used against non-whites in America , was all the more offensive because all the women were citizens , and three were born in the U.S .\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2013 a federal agency \u2013 uses \u201c go back to where you came from \u201d as an example of an ethnic slur , said Haris Hardaway , the owner of a boutique in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston .\nDuring the Jim Crow era , those words were \u201c used to invalidate our humanity and our citizenship of this country , \u201d Mr. Hardaway said . \u201d And that \u2019 s why I see them as racist . \u201d\nAs this comparison shows , there are two very different working definitions of racism in the U.S. \u2013 the red state definition , and the blue state definition .\nIt \u2019 s no longer the 1960s . Most Americans would likely agree that it is racist to stand in a schoolhouse door , as then-Gov .

For his part , Mr. Trump disavowed the chant Thursday , saying , \u201c I disagree with it . \u201d\n\u201c Go back to the civil rights marches in the \u2019 50s and \u2019 60s , and a lot of white communities did not quite understand what racism was . So this is not new . It is more modern day racism with a suit and tie , \u201d says retiree Danny Hardaway , Haris \u2019 s father .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s \u201c go back \u201d tweet and his subsequent comments were aimed at Democratic Reps.

President Donald Trump ignited a firestorm with a tweet aimed at them .\nThe \u201c go back \u201d phrase \u2019 s long use to portray foreigners and non-white ethnic groups as not deserving of a place in America forced the news media to grapple with its descriptive terms in the wake of Mr. Trump \u2019 s eruption .

Fox News senior analyst Brit Hume thought Mr. Trump \u2019 s statements were nativist , ignorant , bad , and bad politics \u2013 but not racist . It didn \u2019 t meet the first definition of \u201c racism \u201d in the Merriam-Webster dictionary , he said : \u201c a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race . \u201d\nMany Trump rally attendees offered variations of this position in explaining why they didn \u2019 t think his tweet was racist .

Given the history of the phrase , what else would it be referring to , other than a minority whose position in America is thought tenuous ? Without using specifics , it calls into question their place in the nation .

How could they come to our country and tell us what to do ? But all ... these women are Americans , \u201d says William Watkins , a 7th district voter and director of workforce development at the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts .\nA USA Today-Ipsos poll released Wednesday found that 65 % of Americans aware of Mr. Trump \u2019 s \u201c go back \u201d statement agreed that it was racist .\nBut as is often the case in American politics today , that opinion broke sharply along partisan lines , with many Republicans saying it was not racist . And fully 70 % of GOP respondents to the survey agreed with the statement \u201c people who call others \u2018 racist \u2019 usually do so in bad faith . \u201d\nThat was another primary argument used by Trump supporters as to why they did not believe racism described his actions . Democrats and others don \u2019 t really mean it when they cry \u201c racist , \u201d they said . It \u2019 s just an all-purpose insult , an evocative one , used by his enemies .\n\u201c They are just so flippant with it , \u201d said Al Byrum of Nags Head outside the President Trump rally venue .\nThe more it \u2019 s used , the more it loses its meaning , some Republicans say . Fox News talk show host Greg Gutfeld on Tuesday mocked CNN and MSNBC for a report that they used the word \u201c racist \u201d or variations 1,100 times in two days following President Trump \u2019 s tweet . National Review senior editor Jay Nordlinger \u2013 no fan of Mr. Trump or the \u201c go back \u201d language \u2013 himself tweeted that as a Reagan conservative he \u2019 d been called a racist so often the charge now rings hollow .\nThose who feel the sting of being called racist experience it as an insult . If it \u2019 s used over and over , the power of that sting may lessen .\nBut those who use it see \u201c racist \u201d as both insult and description . It \u2019 s like calling something \u201c blue , \u201d to many Democrats and minorities . If you call 1,100 things blue , the 1,101st object is still blue . It hasn \u2019 t turned green due to \u201c blue \u201d overuse .\nBut the identification of something as racist can be more subjective than simply noting its color .
