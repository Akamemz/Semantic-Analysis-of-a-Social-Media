Ted Lieu ( D-CA ) missed the vote because he was recovering from a heart procedure ) .\nThat outcome was no surprise , since the Judiciary Committee is generally filled with staunch liberals and conservatives , and since opinion on Trump \u2019 s impeachment and the Ukraine scandal has fallen along partisan lines in the House .\nThe committee \u2019 s vote came after a lengthy , three-part hearing \u2014 opening statements Wednesday night , a marathon all-day debate on amendments to the articles Thursday , and a final vote Friday .
