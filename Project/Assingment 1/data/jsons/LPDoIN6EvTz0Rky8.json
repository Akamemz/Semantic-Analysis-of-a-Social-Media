He thus could not comprehend why then\u2013FBI director James Comey would not assure the public of what Comey was privately assuring both the president and the public \u2019 s representatives in Congress , namely : The notion that the president was a suspect was false . Implicitly , the narrative that Trump had colluded with Putin to steal the election was false .\nTo be clear , the Russia investigation is not a fraud . The Trump collusion narrative is .
