    "content": "After more than a month of silence , the ABC News/Washington Post national presidential poll , which is one of the five selected by the Republican/Democrat-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) to determine eligibility for this fall 's televised gabfests , came out with a new survey this morning that puts another nail in the coffin of Gary Johnson 's debate hopes .\nThe Libertarian nominee set a new high in the poll , at 9 percent ( Hillary Clinton was at 46 percent , Donald Trump at 41 , and Jill Stein at 2 ) , but that only brings his five-poll average to 9.0 percent , with less than a week to go before the CPD 's deadline of `` mid September . '' With only two of the other polls ( CBS News and NBC/Wall Street Journal ) due for a new survey between now and then , that means Johnson would have to average 25 percent in each to achieve a five-poll average of 15.0 percent . He has yet to produce a national number higher than 13 percent . It 's no wonder that the Johnson/Bill Weld ticket signaled a new debate strategy yesterday in New York : Drum up outrage at their non-inclusion by hosting live answer sessions outside of each debate this fall .\n* Johnson is competitive with Trump among voters under the age of 40 , pulling 17 percent compared to the Republican 's 24 ( Clinton dominates with 47 percent ; Stein lags at 8 ) . This is consistent with the Libertarian 's campaign-long trend of doing disproportionately well with the youngest blocs of voters .\n* Third-party backers are `` far more apt than either Clinton or Trump supporters to say they might change their minds by Election Day . Just 15 percent of Clinton and Trump supporters say they could change their minds , vs. 55 percent of Johnson 's and Stein 's . '' This would suggest that the typical third-party fade , which unusually did not befall Johnson and Stein over the summer , could yet take place should the Clinton-Trump race tighten .\n* The poll was conducted between Sept. 5-8 , meaning that only the last day could have possibly been impacted by Johnson blanking on the name Aleppo during a Morning Joe interview Thursday morning . While I have my strong doubts that the incident will negatively impact Johnson 's poll results , we just do n't have enough evidence in yet . Morning Consult is the only other poll to sample during the period ( Sept. 6-8 ) , and there Johnson set a new four-candidate high this week of 10 percent , though he had finished as high as 12 percent in that survey before Jill Stein 's name was added . ( UPDATE : The latest Breitbart/Gravis poll , which questioned voters Sept. 7-8 , was published this afternoon , and showed Johnson at 7 percent , up from 4 percent Aug. 22-23 , though down from his high of 9 percent Aug. 9 [ Gravis has had more extreme swings for Johnson than any other poll ] . ) Though he 's certainly putting a brave face on things , vice presidential nominee William Weld told me yesterday that `` not only has our fundraising increased in the two days since Aleppo morning , but the amount of attention and name-recognition that Gary has garnered is just through the roof ! ''\nJohnson this past week also hit a new poll-high for NBC/Survey Monkey ( 12 percent ) , and tied his highs with Rasmussen Reports ( 9 percent ) and Reuters/Ipsos ( 8 percent ) , while backsliding in the crucial Big-Five survey by CNN/ORC ( 7 percent ) . His campaign also made headlines by polling north of 15 percent in a whopping 15 states . Expect to see those states targeted more and more by both the campaign and its supporting SuperPACs , as the focus inevitably turns toward moving the needle locally and even trying to pick off a state or two .",
