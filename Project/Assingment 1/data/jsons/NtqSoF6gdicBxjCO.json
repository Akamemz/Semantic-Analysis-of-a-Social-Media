About fifteen years ago \u201cthe angry left\u201d appeared on the scene, and its indignant members got a lot of attention from the media. The enormous volume of press attention signaled the media\u2019s manifest approval, if sotto voce. Next came the Occupiers\u2019 movement, and again these ruffians came with the media\u2019s approval, at least sotto voce.
