But the process is far from over : May must now get a deeply divided UK Parliament to approve the plan .\nHostility for the deal has been building for nearly two weeks , ever since May first unveiled the proposed agreement .\nThe most vocal resistance comes from the prime minister \u2019 s own Conservative Party , a fractured mess of loyalists and hardline \u201c Brexiteers \u201d who want a more decisive break with the European Union . The opposition Labour Party has also said it will resist the deal . Right now , at least , the withdrawal agreement doesn \u2019 t seem to have the votes .\nThis standstill could push everyone toward a \u201c no deal \u201d Brexit , the \u201c cliff edge \u201d scenario that would be bad for the EU , and likely catastrophic for Britain . Planes would be grounded , ports would be clogged , food would rot , and garbage would pile up , and those are just some of the possible scenarios .\nMay \u2019 s future is riding on the agreement , as well . At a Sunday press conference , she warned that a failed deal would lead to division and uncertainty . That includes her own job , which is far from secure as she faces pushback from all sides .\nAmid this political turmoil , Brexit \u2019 s March 29 , 2019 , deadline inches ever closer . Here \u2019 s a look at some possible outcomes as May prepares to test her deal in Parliament .\nTo recap , May introduced a Brexit proposal on November 14 after months of back-and-forth with EU leaders .\nThis lengthy agreement tackles some of the critical issues in the forthcoming EU-UK break-up , specifically the divorce settlement ( how much the UK must pay the EU , which is likely at least \u00a339 billion , or about $ 50 billion ) and the post-Brexit status of UK citizens and EU nationals living in the EU and UK , respectively . It also includes the Irish \u201c backstop , \u201d ensuring that the politically sensitive border between Northern Ireland ( part of the UK ) and the Republic of Ireland ( an EU country ) remains open , even if the UK and EU don \u2019 t finalize border details in a post-Brexit deal .\nThe withdrawal agreement also calls for a 21-month transition period until December 31 , 2020 , to give the EU and the UK time to figure out their future relationship , the hard details of the trade , security cooperation , and more . ( The transition can be renewed one time for up to two years . ) A political declaration lays out the broad outlines for this arrangement .\nThe details of these plan were largely finalized on Sunday , when the 27 EU member states signed off on the deal in Brussels . The European Parliament will also need to formally approve the agreement at some point . But first it \u2019 s got to get ratified by the UK Parliament .\nAnd this is promising to be difficult because every political camp within the UK has found something to hate in this agreement .\nMay \u2019 s plan , briefly , is an attempt at a \u201c soft \u201d Brexit compromise , but even those who favor closer alignment with the EU don \u2019 t love this deal . They see this deal as severing too many ties to EU , leaving Britain weaker and worse off economically than it was before .\nThe hardline \u201c Brexiteers \u201d in her party are virulently opposed \u2014 though it \u2019 s unlikely they \u2019 d be pleased by any deal . They see May \u2019 s deal as preventing the UK from reclaiming control of its borders and laws , and blocking it from making trade deals with other countries . Under May \u2019 s deal , the UK will also still have to follow EU customs rules for a period of time , but will lose its decision-making power in the bloc .\nThen there \u2019 s Labour , the opposition party led by Jeremy Corbyn . Labour has its own disagreements about Brexit within the party , but it has collectively rejected May \u2019 s deal , saying it doesn \u2019 t meet their required pillars for a satisfactory Brexit . The party also sees this as an opportunity : If May and her deal implode , it might put them closer to regaining control of the government .\nThere \u2019 s pushback from other corners , including the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) , a party from Northern Ireland . The DUP \u2019 s partnership with the Tories is keeping May in power . This party has resisted the deal ; they object to the Irish border backstop plan because it would apply different rules to Northern Ireland , compared to the rest of the UK .\nThe bottom line : Few are satisfied with this compromise , because the UK is splintered between those who want out of the EU and those who never wanted to leave in the first place . No side actually \u201c wins \u201d with this deal .\nAnd May \u2019 s own government is divided on the plan . After she secured cabinet approval of her draft deal last week , two top Cabinet ministers quit in protest the next day , including her Brexit secretary . ( Several other junior members also stepped down . ) It \u2019 s a sign the divisions within Britain are deep enough to derail whatever May brings home from Brussels .\nThe UK Parliament could approve the deal ... at some point\nThe UK Parliament will vote on the Brexit deal in mid-December . May needs 320 votes to pass the agreement , but it \u2019 s not clear yet if she will have the support .\nBack in 2017 , May tried to shore up support for Brexit negotiations by calling snap elections . Her plan backfired , and May \u2019 s Conservative Party ended up losing the majority , and formed a minority government with the DUP , whose 10 votes it needed to retain power .\nThe DUP said May has broken her promise on Brexit , and seems unlikely to support the deal .\nAs many as 51 Conservative party members have said they wouldn \u2019 t vote for a previous \u201c soft \u201d Brexit plan , but the number of total defectors right now is unclear . May \u2019 s cabinet will try to whip votes , though that won \u2019 t likely convince the hardcore Brexiteers .\nIt seems likely May will need to peel off some Labour votes in order to get her deal passed . ( Labour has broadly rejected the deal , but there \u2019 s still a chance that some MPs could break off and support it . )\nSo while it \u2019 s too early to say May \u2019 s deal is headed for defeat , it \u2019 s definitely not looking great .\nAt least on the first try . Experts say if the Brexit deal gets voted down in December , there \u2019 s a chance May might be able to try again , especially if the financial markets or businesses freak out at the prospect no-deal scenario .\nIn other words : The UK will have to be pushed to the brink to get Parliament to finally act .\nWhich is why some observers say this deal might eventually pass \u2014 but maybe not until the second try . If the markets react severely , members of Parliament may be cowed into going \u201c back and take a second look \u201d at the deal , according to Spencer Boyer , a senior fellow with the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement .\nMay could step aside after a leadership challenge from her Conservative party\nPro-Brexit Conservative MPs led the charge to oust May last week . Their efforts have since stalled , but at least 26 Tories confirmed they submitted letters of no confidence against May last week , arguing her handling of Brexit has made her unfit to lead .\nAt least 48 MPs must turn in letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee , the Conservatives \u2019 parliamentary group , to trigger a \u201c no confidence \u201d vote within the party . May needs a majority \u2014 158 Tory MPs \u2014 to survive . If she loses , she \u2019 d have to step aside . If she defeats the challenge , she can \u2019 t be challenged by her party for 12 months .\nThe rebellion against May fizzled out , as it appeared her opponents overestimated their support and couldn \u2019 t reach the 48-letter threshold .\nBut the threat could be revived now that May has finalized the deal , as the pro-Brexit crowd isn \u2019 t likely to stop agitating against her .\nYet the schisms within May \u2019 s own Conservative party could ultimately protect her from a leadership challenge . \u201c The reason she \u2019 s managed to last has been that there isn \u2019 t a clear alternative [ to her ] , \u201d Simon Usherwood , a professor at the University of Surrey and deputy director of an independent Brexit think tank , told me .\nIn other words , the pro-Brexit and pro-European wings of her party fear May \u2019 s replacement could be far more opposed to their positions . \u201c Nobody feels entirely sure that if they got rid of her they would get ... someone who \u2019 s more favorable and supportive of what they want , \u201d Usherwood added .\nIn March 2017 , May formally triggered Article 50 of the EU \u2019 s Lisbon Treaty . That set off a two-year countdown to the formal Brexit deadline of March 29 , 2019 .\nIf her Brexit deal fails in Parliament , that could push the UK closer to the brink of a devastating no-deal Brexit . But the UK might try to finagle an extension , arguing it needs more time to approve a deal , or negotiate more concessions , or buy time in the case of political uncertainty , such as a leadership change .\nThere \u2019 s no guarantee the EU would go for this . The complications are many , including upcoming EU parliamentary elections in May . And European leaders have said it \u2019 s this deal or no deal , so it seems highly unlikely they \u2019 d consider going back to the negotiating table .\nThe idea of a second referendum , or a \u201c people \u2019 s vote \u201d on Brexit , has been percolating for a while . Perhaps years of Brexit drama has been enough to change some people \u2019 s minds , or the public could solve the gridlock in Parliament , the thinking goes .\nBut how to get a second referendum \u2014 or what it would look like \u2014 is complicated . May said she would not call for one , so barring any last-minute about face or leadership change , it \u2019 s unlikely to happen . It would also be a near-impossible feat to hold a campaign before the March 29 , and would probably require begging the EU for an Article 50 extension .\nThere \u2019 s also the fact that a second referendum would likely be messy . It \u2019 s not clear what the referendum would ask . Would it be a test of May \u2019 s Brexit deal versus no-deal ? Would it involve multiple choices \u2014 leave , stay , or take the deal ? Would it be a do-over of the original 2016 \u201c leave \u201d versus \u201c remain , \u201d which will still disappoint at least half of a bitterly divided country and not necessarily change the outcome ?\nSome Labour MPs are pushing to have a vote on a second referendum , but Corbyn has declined to come out strongly in favor . \u201c It \u2019 s an option for the future , but it \u2019 s not an option for today , \u201d Corbyn said over the weekend .\nProponents of the second referendum who see it as a Brexit out might be deluding themselves , too . \u201c The last two national votes we \u2019 ve had haven \u2019 t gone the way that people thought they would , \u201d Usherwood said . \u201c So do you really want to open up a huge amount of uncertainty ? \u201d\nMay currently faces a leadership challenge within her own party . But if MPs turn against her in Parliament , that could throw the entire government into turmoil .\nThe DUP sent a few warning shots , refusing to support Conservative legislation twice last week to pressure May on a better Brexit deal . May needs DUP \u2019 s 10 votes to stay in power ; if they defect from her government , the Conservatives lose a majority . That could lead to a no-confidence vote in Parliament , potentially triggering general elections .\nLabour , meanwhile , has been pushing for new elections \u2014 and there \u2019 s always a chance they could get them if May \u2019 s deal blows up badly enough in Parliament , or her government crumbles . \u201c Labour \u2019 s top priority is to get back in power , \u201d Boyer told me .\nA second referendum or a new general election seems implausible now . But Brexit \u2019 s one promise is to be unpredictable .\nWhat happened in Brussels this weekend means it \u2019 s now up to the United Kingdom to decide whether to accept this divorce deal , or not . And European leaders have made clear that it \u2019 s this deal , or no deal at all .\n\u201c This is the best deal for the UK , the best deal for Europe , this is the only deal possible , \u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Sunday .\nErik Jones , the director of European and Eurasian Studies at Johns Hopkins University , told me that even if MPs object to this premise , or vote down the deal believing there \u2019 s a better one to be had , there \u2019 s not much more Europe can give that will sway the ideologues on either side .\n\u201c You \u2019 re not going to get any significant concessions , \u201d he said . \u201c If you think that there \u2019 s any silver bullet that could change the minds of enough members of the British Parliament having voted it down once , it just ain \u2019 t there . \u201d\nLooming over these debates is the possibility of a no-deal Brexit . The economic and logistical pain of crashing out of the EU may be enough to push MPs to accept an imperfect Brexit deal . \u201c Everyone \u2019 s made a lot of noise and has been unhappy about this , that and the other , but they haven \u2019 t been able to agree on an alternative plan of action , \u201d Usherwood said .\nSo , in the end , the current Brexit deal may be the only option .
