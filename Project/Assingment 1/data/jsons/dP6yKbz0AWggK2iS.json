Richard Lugar and Georgetown University 's McCourt School of Public Policy , released its inaugural Bipartisan Index Tuesday , ranking members of Congress based on how frequently they work across the aisle.The rankings are based on lawmakers \u2019 sponsorship and co-sponsorship of bills , and measure the degree to which they succeeded in attracting co-sponsors from the opposing party and crossed the aisle to co-sponsor others \u2019 bills during the last two Congresses . `` The Bipartisan Index offers the public an objective way to measure how frequently their members of Congress are cooperating with the other party on matters of policy , '' Lugar said in a press release , according to Real Clear Politics `` We hope this ranking will incentivize members of Congress to be more bipartisan when writing legislation and making co-sponsorship decisions , as well as keeping an open mind about legislation introduced by the other party . '' The Lugar Center \u2014 which bills itself as focused on issues such as `` nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction , global food security , foreign assistance effectiveness and global development , energy security , and enhancing bipartisan governance '' \u2014 plans later this year to release lifetime rankings of each member of Congress dating back to 1993 , Real Clear Politics reports.But it said the 112th and 113th Congresses were the most partisan since 1993 . `` This is not a situation to be celebrated , '' Lugar told USA Today . `` It 's one to be turned around . `` According to USA Today , the Lugar Center came up with historical average scores for members of the minority and majority parties , and then lawmakers in the last Congress were compared to the baseline to see whether they ranked above or below average.Only a little more than one-third of those serving from 2013-2014 were ranked `` bipartisan , '' according to USA Today , with top scorers in the Senate including Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia . Those ranked as least bipartisan included Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Tim Scott of South Carolina.In the House , GOP Reps. Christopher Gibson and Peter King of New York ranked most bipartisan , while Reps. Tim Huelskamp , R-Kan. , and Donna Edwards , D-Md. , were least bipartisan.The scores of presidential candidates in the Senate were all in the bottom half of the index , according to Real Clear Politics , including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio ; Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul ; Cruz ; and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . `` Right now , most citizens are unhappy with the lack of progress in Congress , the lack of legislation moving forward or \u2014 worse still \u2014 such tie-ups that the government may shut down or be threatened with being shut down from time to time , '' Lugar told USA Today.The trend has been noted before.Tracking voting patterns since the early 1950s , CQ Roll Call has found partisanship and polarization are driving legislative behavior more than in any other period since at least the start of the Eisenhower administration , according to USA Today .
