    "content": "Even as President Obama clearly attempted during a Sunday 60 Minutes interview to blame others for his failure to recognize ISIS as a growing threat in the Middle East , Monday 's NBC Today spun the buck-passing as a `` very candid '' admission by the commander-in-chief .\nCo-host Matt Lauer opened the morning show by proclaiming : `` Underestimated . The President admits his administration and U.S. intelligence officials misjudged the threat of ISIS . '' While that headline suggested to viewers that Obama was taking responsibility for the failure , a soundbite ran of the President distancing himself from blame : `` I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria . ''\nIntroducing the story moments later , Lauer declared : `` President Obama acknowledging in a new interview that U.S. officials underestimated ISIS and overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to take on the terror group . '' In the report that followed , chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel announced : `` This seemed to be a very candid interview , the President blamed the former U.S.-backed Iraqi government for allowing ISIS to flourish and said American intelligence did n't fully appreciate the threat . '' [ Listen to the audio ]\nOn Sunday , The Daily Beast 's Eli Lake ripped apart Obama 's attempt to blame the intelligence community for dropping the ball on ISIS : `` Reached by The Daily Beast after Obama 's interview aired , one former senior Pentagon official who worked closely on the threat posed by Sunni jihadists in Syria and Iraq was flabbergasted . 'Either the president does n't read the intelligence he 's getting or he 's bullshitting , ' the former official said . ''\nIn addition , on August 10 , NBC 's chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell appeared on Meet the Press and similarly dismantled the President 's claims of being in the dark about ISIS :\nAnd to say that he did n't have intelligence . This is not a hard target . This is Irbil . We have people there . The fact is , there was intelligence . And to say that they were shocked by the Peshmerga on Saturday night being routed is a farce . The White House was n't listening .\nEven Engel himself on September 3 appeared on Mitchell 's MSNBC show and explained : `` President Obama says he has no strategy yet for Syria . This has been going on for over three years . The buildup of ISIS has not been rapid , it has been quite slow . It has been quite well-documented .... So that we have no strategy to deal with ISIS is quite \u2013 is quite ridiculous at this stage . ''\nGiven NBC 's own reporting on how Obama knew about the ISIS build-up all along , how could the network describe the President passing the blame as `` very candid '' ?\nOn ABC 's Good Morning America on Monday , co-host George Stephanopoulos tried to push similar spin regarding Obama 's remarks to 60 Minutes : `` ... the President pretty frank about what went wrong here . '' However , White House correspondent Jon Karl called out the presidential blame game : `` The President bluntly acknowledged that the United States got it wrong .... But , George , even as he acknowledged this ... the President made it clear this was a mistake made by the intelligence community , he was n't taking personal responsibility here .
