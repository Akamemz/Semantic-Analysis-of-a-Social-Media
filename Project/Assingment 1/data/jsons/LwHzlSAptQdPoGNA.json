The first was much maligned for excessively collecting data from teenaged participants via tools that granted the company \u201c root access \u201d to the teens \u2019 phones .

But to understand why , it \u2019 s worth looking closely at Europe \u2019 s efforts to regulate the tech industry .\nThe General Data Protection Regulation , or GDPR , was implemented by the European Union in late May of last year . It institutes new rules governing what companies may collect from a consumer , permits users to opt-out of such collection , and allows regulators to fine companies as much as 4 percent of their global revenue for violating the new statutes .

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act , which governs online data collection , only prohibits companies from intercepting communications without permission ; it does nothing to address how companies handle the data they freely collect with consumers \u2019 tacit , and often-unintentional , consent . For example , most consumers would be surprised to learn how many apps freely and legally access a phone \u2019 s audio for the collection of keywords to be used in private advertising .\nSo it is not hard to understand the desire for additional guardrails to be put in place in order to prevent the kinds of abuses and overreach to which endeavors such as Facebook \u2019 s new study could lead .
