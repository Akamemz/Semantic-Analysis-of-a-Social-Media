    "content": "Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams prepared the Democrats ' response to President Trump 's State of the Union address . Going into it , none of us really knew what to expect but honestly , the bar was n't set too high . Abrams never conceded to Brian Kemp and she 's continually pushed the idea that `` voter suppression '' ( not the people 's voice ) is what kept her from winning her bid for governor of Georgia .\nAlthough the Democrats might not have known exactly what President Trump was going to address on Tuesday night , whoever wrote her speech cast a really , really wide net . She mentioned issues Trump did n't even touch on , like gun control and climate change . Not only that , but the response was focused on Abrams personal story . And while she tried to use her own anecdotal experiences to deliver a message , it came off as selfish and rather narcissistic .\nOur power and strength as Americans lives in our hard work and our belief in more . My family understood firsthand that while success is not guaranteed , we live in a nation where opportunity is possible . But we do not succeed alone -- in these United States , when times are tough , we can persevere because our friends and neighbors will come for us . Our first responders will come for us . It is this mantra - this uncommon grace of community - that has driven me to become an attorney , a small business owner , a writer , and most recently , the Democratic nominee for Governor of Georgia . My reason for running for governor was simple : I love our country and its promise of opportunity for all , and I stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father 's credo -- together , we are coming for America , for a better America .\nIs this her way of hinting that Americans should always help others ? Specifically , is she referring to Democrats ' desire to help illegal aliens ?\nWhat 's so wrong with Americans standing up and deciding that we must help our own people before we help other nations . We 're so busy fighting everyone 's battles for them that we fail to address our own crises here at home , in America . President Trump has made it his personal mission to make sure we put America first . And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that .\nJust a few weeks ago , I joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers . They waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they had n't received a paycheck in weeks . Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace . The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States , one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people - but our values .\nPresident Trump warned Democrats . He told them he wanted a border wall . It should n't come as a surprise . He campaigned on building a wall years ago . He specifically told Democrats last year , when he signed the budget , that next year he wanted border wall funding or a shutdown would happen . They called his bluff and guess who came out looking like the fool ? The Dems .\nThis was n't a `` stunt '' that abandoned people . This was a promise he was fulfilling to the American people . Democrats are the ones who refused to compromise with him . He was willing to extend protections for DREAMers and what was Speaker Pelosi 's response ? `` We wo n't give one dollar for the border wall . ''\nIf you want to point the finger at anyone , look at madam speaker .\nFor seven years , I led the Democratic Party in the Georgia House of Representatives . I did n't always agree with the Republican Speaker or Governor , but I understood that our constituents did n't care about our political parties -- they cared about their lives . So , when we had to negotiate criminal justice reform or transportation or foster care improvements , the leaders of our state did n't shut down -- we came together . And we kept our word .\nGreat . You had an accomplishment . What does this have to do with Trump 's vision ? Oh , right . Nothing .\nOur most urgent work is to realize Americans ' dreams of today and tomorrow . To carve a path to independence and prosperity that can last a lifetime . Children deserve an excellent education from cradle to career . We owe them safe schools and the highest standards , regardless of zip code . Yet this White House responds timidly while first graders practice active shooter drills and the price of higher education grows ever steeper . From now on , our leaders must be willing to tackle gun safety measures and the crippling effect of educational loans ; to support educators and invest what is necessary to unleash the power of America 's greatest minds .\nAs a nation , we 've agreed to educate our kids from kindergarten through 12th grade . Anything beyond that is up to the individual . Part of having the `` equality of opportunity '' aspect has to end somewhere . If we made sure every single person was walked through life , from education to career , we 'd have people complaining that they were discriminated against if they became a plumber while their friend became a lawyer . People would still not be happy . At some point , we have to take responsibility for our future and make our own decisions . When the government has their hand in every single aspect of our lives , we 're one step closer to living in a tyrannical society , the one thing our founding fathers worried about .\nIn Georgia and around the country , people are striving for a middle class where a salary truly equals economic security . But instead , families ' hopes are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just does n't understand it . Under the current administration , far too many hard-working Americans are falling behind , living paycheck to paycheck , most without labor unions to protect them from even worse harm .
