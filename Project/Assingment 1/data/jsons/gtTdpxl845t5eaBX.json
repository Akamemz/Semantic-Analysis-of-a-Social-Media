Though best known in recent years for proposing broad tax cuts to promote economic growth , this time they are talking up the need for growth plus something more \u2013 rebuilding ladders of upward mobility .\nJeb Bush , an expected Republican candidate for president , recently lamented , \u201c Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. \u201d He also said that an urgent need for the nation is to \u201c restore America \u2019 s faith ... that any child born today can reach further than their parents . \u201d\nAnother prospective candidate on the right , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R ) of Florida , uses a new book , `` American Dreams : Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone '' to pitch a similar theme , echoing President Obama by calling saying stalled mobility is \u201c the central challenge of our time. \u201d ( Mr. Obama has used the word \u201c defining \u201d rather than \u201c central . \u201d )\nThe two parties differ in their diagnosis of the problem and on solutions . But to a considerable extent , they are singing from similar song sheet : They agree that ordinary Americans \u2013 call them \u201c working \u201d or \u201c middle-class \u201d or \u201c average \u201d \u2013 are financially strained and that the challenge merits some focused policy attention .\nJared Bernstein , an economist and former adviser to the Obama administration , says that basic consensus represents a significant step \u2013 paving the way for a vigorous policy debate between now and the election .\n\u201c It is important and gratifying to hear pundits and politicians from all sides \u2014 many of whom assiduously avoided such topics in the past \u2014 talking with fervor about these issues , \u201d Mr. Bernstein says in a new online column hosted by The Washington Post .\nWhy has the shift by politicians and others occurred ? Why , even though the 2016 hopefuls don \u2019 t want to sound like an Obama retread by using the phrase \u201c middle-class economics , \u201d is there such focus on precisely that ?\nOne is simply that the recovery from recession remains far from complete . Although the labor market has been improving steadily , the 5.5 percent official unemployment rate masks the fact that millions remain unemployed or underemployed .
