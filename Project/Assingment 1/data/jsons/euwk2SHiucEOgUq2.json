North Carolina is not quite a microcosm , but is somewhat representative of that : a very polarized state in which the dominant party is beginning to lose its grip . \u201d\nBut few have tested the tensile strength of democratic bounds more than North Carolina , where Republicans have sought to deprive the Democratic governor of his power \u2013 most recently last week , by staging an override vote of his budget veto while most Democrats were absent .\nHistorians say democracies rarely fail by force .

The shape of U.S. democracy has become increasingly one-sided , with most states now either solidly blue or solidly red . Perhaps as a result , both sides increasingly feel the other is out to destroy them , as 6 out of 10 voters said in a recent poll .\nDeb Butler yelled it over and over again , her jaw set as though in stone : \u201c Mr . Speaker , we will not yield ! \u201d\nStanding in a near-empty legislative chamber at 16 Jones Street in Raleigh , North Carolina , Ms. Butler , a Democratic legislator , rose in rage after watching Republicans taking advantage of a large number of absent Democrats to override the Democratic governor \u2019 s budget veto .\nHer angry stand \u2013 captured on a colleague \u2019 s cellphone \u2013 went viral . But even though she may have added 20,000 Twitter followers last week , the experience left her cold .\n\u201c I have become increasingly aware of the fragility of this young experiment called American Democracy , \u201d says Ms. Butler in a phone interview . \u201c It \u2019 s terribly unsettling and scary . \u201d\nIn some ways , Ms. Butler and her fellow Democrats say , the stunt crossed the line from political hardball to dirty trick in a state where distrust and acrimony run deep . For their part , state Republicans say they saw an opportunity and took it .\nTheir intent wasn \u2019 t secret at all . Caught in a stalemate over teacher salaries and Medicaid expansion , Republicans had said they were looking for a chance to override the veto .\n\u201c If I see an opportunity to override this budget veto , I was going to take that vote , \u201d House Speaker Tim Moore told The Associated Press .\nFueled by tribal polarization and looming demographic shifts , the dramatic showdown in Raleigh , some political scientists say , harbors both the fundamental weakness of U.S. democracy as well as its potential for redemptive strength .\n\u201c American democracy ... is hard to kill , and there are a lot of forces working to stabilize and protect it , so we are not at the edge of a cliff , \u201d says Harvard University political scientist Steven Levitsky , co-author of the 2018 book \u201c When Democracies Die. \u201d \u201c But the use of the letter of the law to clearly subvert its spirit , that \u2019 s what happens when politicians abandon restraint .

Far more often it \u2019 s \u201c subversion by stealth \u201d \u2013 the piecemeal dismantling of democratic norms . And in the U.S. , state democracies have historically been just as defined by weakness as strength .\nIn fact , until 1965 , most of the South lived under one-party oligarchies , mostly Democrat , that imposed a racist order on the population . Malapportionment \u2013 the slow-walking of power to cities and away from rural areas \u2013 resonated until the 1980s , a nadir when some Southern states saw only about 2 in 10 voters vested enough in the system to bother casting votes , says Philip Rocco , a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee .\n\u201c Before we start talking about democratic backsliding in the states , let \u2019 s remember that states are late democratizers , \u201d says Mr. Rocco . \u201c [ But in North Carolina ] the norms of institutional reciprocity and restraint that make it possible to have smooth transitions of government have been short-circuited . Then the question becomes : How long can you play hardball before you really are threatening the framework of subnational democracy ? \u201d\nThe shape of democracy and how it impacts how Americans live , work , love , and play has begun to look increasingly one-sided . Most U.S. states are now either solidly blue or solidly red .
