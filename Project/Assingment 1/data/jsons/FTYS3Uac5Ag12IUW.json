That \u2019 s a particularly impressive accomplishment for Moon given that he and Trump have at times clashed sharply about how aggressively to confront North Korea . Tensions got so bad that in September , Trump accused Moon of \u201c appeasement . \u201d\nTrump is taking a very different line now , expressing an openness to talks with Kim that would have seemed unimaginable when the president threatened to \u201c totally destroy \u201d North Korea during a United Nations address in September .\nExperts say the shift reflects the success of Moon \u2019 s persistent push for \u201c anytime , anywhere \u201d diplomacy with Pyongyang . The South Korean leader \u2019 s efforts got a major boost during the runup to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics , when he and Kim got into high-level talks over North Korea \u2019 s participation in the games .

Moon has managed to charm Trump after a period of stormy relations , and has ensured that South Korea is now playing an indispensable role in talks over denuclearizing North Korea .\nBut it \u2019 s also a risky gambit .

Moon helped engineer the \u201c Sunshine Policy \u201d of approaching North Korea with dialogue and economic aid , which led to , among other things , a substantial reduction in tensions between the countries and a boom in South Korean tourism in the North .\nRoh \u2019 s successors took a harder line on North Korea . When Moon campaigned for the presidency last year , he proposed a return to the Sunshine framework as a way to reduce tensions with the North . The platform was playfully nicknamed \u201c Moonshine \u201d policy .\nAfter he took office , Moon quickly proposed talks with North Korea , and his administration continually indicated that under the right circumstances he would meet with North Korea \u201c anytime , anywhere . \u201d\n\u201c Talking for the sake of talking is enough for him , just to get the ball rolling , \u201d James Person , the research director at the US-Korea Institute , told me .\nMoon also bristled at Trump \u2019 s threats of taking unilateral military action against North Korea . \u201c No one shall take a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean consent , \u201d he said in August . \u201c We will prevent war whatever it takes . \u201d\nWhile Moon and Trump disagreed sharply on how to approach North Korea , analysts say that Moon managed to stay on Trump \u2019 s good side by staying cool in the face of Trump \u2019 s provocations \u2014 and using flattery .\n\u201c He has learned lessons from the Roh Moo-hyun era \u2014 that it does no good to his country to provoke the United States , \u201d Lee Byong-chul , a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul , told the New York Times . \u201c If Roh was blunt and in-your-face , Moon is much more cautious and sophisticated .
