Beside him much of the day \u2014 the 40th day of his presidency \u2014 were Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller . Other aides frequently circled in , from Gary Cohn to Reince Priebus to Kellyanne Conway to Jared Kushner to Sean Spicer to Hope Hicks , suggesting language and offering advice .\nTrump remained unhappy with parts of the speech , scribbling notes on printed drafts for aides to incorporate and bring back . He practiced twice on the teleprompter , timing the cadence for specific lines . He continually peppered his team with questions .\nThe president spent the day of his first address to a joint session of Congress , according to multiple White House officials , much as presidents have before him : revising , reworking and rehearsing . The attention to detail was somewhat unusual for a president who often seems to wing it .\nOn Tuesday morning , he had \u201c marked up , from front to back , \u201d 17 or 18 pages of text , one White House official said . The president edited again at 3 p.m . The first paragraph was edited as late as 5 p.m .\nAround 6:15 p.m. , he was convinced the speech had come together . Most in the White House never saw the remarks before he delivered them , because aides were conscientious about avoiding leaks . He kept practicing in the presidential limo on the way over .\nWhat emerged was a presidential address carrying little of the jarring tone and \u201c American carnage \u201d of his previous speeches , with a similar message but delivered in a far lighter tone . It heartened his Republican allies and soothed some worried Democrats . While some Democrats criticized the speech , and questions lingered about whether he could follow through , for one night it seemed Trump had done what his Republican allies wanted him to do : seem presidential and deliver a message that hewed to the party line .\n\u201c The delivery was solid . It had true moments of emotion , \u201d said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley . \u201c It was the moment he went from being a partisan figure to trying to be a uniting figure . For the first time , he seemed like a president . He seemed to have the aura . It was the high-water mark of his presidency . \u201d\nOne senior administration official said Trump was \u201c very pleased \u201d afterward . Back at the White House , he huddled with senior staff in the residence to ask them what they 'd heard about the speech and thank them , said several people present . He told aides that members of Congress had given him rave reviews .\nThe senior White House official said Vince Haley , a Trump speechwriter , had come up with the idea of framing the speech around the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence .\nAllies say Trump still needs to focus on the details and that it will take more than one speech to advance his legislative agenda . And Democrats said to not read too much into the speech , questioning some of his facts and casting doubt on his ability to fulfill his promises .\n\u201c The speech and reality have never been more detached , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York .\nBrinkley said that most Americans do n't remember a speech and that Trump will still have to deliver . \u201c He made a lot of promises he does n't have to fulfill , \u201d he said . \u201c You can say you 're going to Mars , you can say you 're going to build that , you can say there are all these problems that you did n't create . \u201d\nTrump , senior White House officials say , took an active role in crafting parts of the speech .
