    "content": "An initial set of post-convention polls out this week shows a sudden swing toward the newly minted Democratic presidential nominee and suggests Clinton begins the three-month sprint to the general election with a consistent \u2014 but not insurmountable \u2014 advantage .\nFive new public surveys , each conducted over the weekend following Democrats \u2019 national party convention , give Clinton a lead ranging from 3 to 9 points . Four of the five pollsters point to a clear Clinton bump , having found Trump ahead or down by only a single point the week before .\nWhat \u2019 s also clear is that the bump exceeds the rise in support for Trump after his convention the week prior . While Trump called his bounce \u201c the biggest bump in the history of conventions , \u201d the best poll for him showed his support ticking up 6 points , while other polls showed no change or a nominal Trump boost .\nClinton \u2019 s bounce appears to be larger . She rose 7 points in her best poll , and 3 or 4 points in the other three polls for which there \u2019 s a direct comparison after Trump \u2019 s convention but before Clinton officially earned her party \u2019 s nomination in Philadelphia .\nAnd that post-Philly bump has given Clinton an unquestionable lead in the general election as the campaign shifts to what could be a long stretch of relative stability . With the two conventions now in the rear-view mirror , the next defining moment of the campaign might not come for eight weeks : the first of three scheduled presidential debates on national television .\nThe bounciest of the new polls , a CNN/ORC International survey conducted Friday-Sunday , shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 points , 52 percent to 43 percent . That \u2019 s a massive shift from just a week prior , when CNN/ORC gave Trump a 3-point lead , 48 percent to 45 percent . Clinton \u2019 s 7-point bounce over that time was larger than Trump \u2019 s 6-point surge from a poll conducted shortly before the GOP convention in Cleveland .\nA new CBS News poll conducted over the same time frame shows Clinton ahead by 6 points , 47 percent to 41 percent . That \u2019 s a 4-point jump for Clinton , who trailed Trump by a point between the two conventions , 44 percent to 43 percent . ( This uses CBS News results including voters leaning toward one candidate , which CBS began to measure with the between-conventions survey . )\nTrump \u2019 s post-convention bounce in CBS News \u2019 polls , on the other hand , was just 2 points .\nThe third poll showing Clinton swelling against Trump was from the online pollster Morning Consult . A 4-point Trump lead after his convention became a 3-point Clinton edge in a new survey released Sunday \u2014 with a 3-point rise in support for Clinton over that time . ( That compares to a slightly larger , 5-point bump for Trump . )\nAnother online survey , a weekly NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released Tuesday morning , gives Clinton an 8-point lead , 50 percent to 42 percent . Since the survey was conducted over a 7-day period from last Monday-Sunday , it includes interviews conducted both during and after the Democratic convention \u2014 but a bounce is still apparent for Clinton . She \u2019 s ticked up 4 points from last week , when she led Trump by just 1 point .\nTrump , on the other hand , got no bounce in last week \u2019 s NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll .\nPublic Policy Polling , the Democratic \u201c robopollster , \u201d found Clinton with a 5-point lead in a post-convention national poll , 46 percent to 41 percent . But PPP hadn \u2019 t conducted a national poll since late June , when Clinton was ahead by 4 points . That suggests \u2014 after a July that included a scathing statement from FBI Director James Comey about her \u201c careless \u201d email practices and a raucous GOP convention \u2014 Clinton has emerged from her own convention still ahead .\nThere is one poll that continues to show Trump in the lead : a web survey from the Los Angeles Times and the University of Southern California . That poll is conducted differently than most others , surveying the same respondents day after day over the course of the campaign , rather than selecting a new , random sample for each poll .\nBut there are other measures that point to Clinton having a more successful convention , at least as reflected in the polls . While Gallup isn \u2019 t conducting public horse-race polling this cycle , the legendary pollster found voters were more likely to say they had a more favorable impression of the Democratic Party following its convention than the GOP after its gathering . Moreover , more respondents narrowly said the Democratic convention made them more likely to vote for Clinton than less likely \u2014 while a 51-percent majority of adults surveyed said the GOP convention actually made them less likely to vote for Trump . And while Trump \u2019 s acceptance speech in Cleveland beat Clinton \u2019 s in television ratings , respondents to the Gallup poll gave higher marks to Clinton \u2019 s speech .\nClinton \u2019 s favorability rating is on the rise following her convention , though it remains historically poor for a major party nominee . In the CBS News poll , Clinton \u2019 s favorable rating now stands at 36 percent , up from 31 percent before the convention . The percentage of voters who have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton shrank from 56 percent last week to 50 percent now .\nGallup is seeing a definite increase in Clinton \u2019 s favorable rating in its rolling , one-week samples measuring both candidates \u2019 favorability . The most recent update includes Americans surveyed last Monday through Sunday , during and after the Democratic convention . Clinton \u2019 s favorable rating is now at 42 percent \u2014 up from 37 percent a week ago . Trump \u2019 s , on the other hand , has slid back to 34 percent , after peaking at 37 percent last week .\nWhile the CNN/ORC poll shows the most dramatic swing on the ballot test , it is stable with regard to Clinton \u2019 s image rating . The poll shows Clinton \u2019 s favorable rating ticking up to 43 percent , from 41 percent the week prior . And the percentage of voters who have an unfavorable opinion dropped just a single point , from 55 percent last week to 54 percent this week .\nThe data \u2014 reflected in the five polls released over the past 48 hours \u2014 are somewhat limited thus far . And with the exception of a PPP poll in Pennsylvania , there hasn \u2019 t been any battleground-state polling since the Democratic convention to confirm Clinton \u2019 s bounce-back extended to the states that really matter .\nThe polls typically become more predictive of the final result following both conventions . And there are only a few defined moments left on the calendar on which the election could be decided , including the three scheduled Clinton-Trump debates . The first one , on Long Island , is in just under eight weeks \u2014 an extended period of campaigning for both candidates without the automatic national attention that comes with a convention or a debate .\nIn the interim , both candidates are plugging away on the campaign trail .
