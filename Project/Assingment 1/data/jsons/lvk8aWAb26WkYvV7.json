    "content": "Kentucky County That Gave War On Poverty A Face Still Struggles\nFifty years ago today , President Lyndon Johnson stood before Congress and declared an `` unconditional war on poverty in America . '' His arsenal included new programs : Medicaid , Medicare , Head Start , food stamps , more spending on education , and tax cuts to help create jobs .\nAt the time , 1 in 5 Americans was poor . Today , things are better , but tens of millions of Americans are still living at or below the poverty level . That raises the question : Did the war on poverty fail ? In the coming year , NPR will explore this question and others about the impact and extent of poverty in the U.S. , and what can be done to reduce it .\nPeople in the isolated hills of Martin County , Ky. , rarely saw outsiders , let alone a president . So when President Lyndon Johnson visited in 1964 to generate support for his proposed war on poverty , it was a big deal .\nLee Mueller , a young newspaper reporter at the time , recalls the crowds in downtown Inez , Ky. , the county seat , waiting for the presidential party to arrive at an abandoned miniature golf course .\n`` It was just like a hayfield full of long grass . It looked like helicopters landing in Vietnam or something when they came over the ridge , '' he says .\nMueller says the locals did n't know their role in this new , domestic war . For the White House , though , coming to Martin County gave poverty a face \u2014 and a name .\n`` In this south-central mountain country , over a third of the population is faced with chronic unemployment , '' says a government film on Johnson 's visit . `` Typical of this group is Tom Fletcher , his wife and eight children . Fletcher , an unemployed sawmill operator , earned only $ 400 last year and has been able to find little employment in the last two years . ''\nHow Is Poverty Measured ? The official poverty rate is based on the minimum income needed to feed a family in the 1950s . It 's updated each year to reflect changing prices but not the declining share that food plays in the typical family budget . What 's more , the rate does not account for many forms of government assistance such as food stamps or housing subsidies .\nAt the time , the poverty rate in this coal-mining area was more than 60 percent . Johnson visited the Fletchers on the porch of their home \u2014 a small wooden structure with fake brick siding . Photographers took what would become one of the iconic images of the war on poverty : the president crouched down , chatting with Tom Fletcher about the lack of jobs .\nFast-forward 50 years . The Fletcher cabin still stands along a windy road about 5 miles outside town . It now has wood siding and is painted orange . There 's a metal fence with a `` no trespassing '' sign to keep out strangers . There are lots of small houses and trailers along this road , but also some new , bigger homes that could be found in any American suburb .\nToday , the roads here are well-paved . People say the schools and hospitals are much better than they used to be . Still , Martin County remains one of the poorest counties in the country . Its poverty rate is 35 percent , more than twice the national average . Unemployment remains high . Only 9 percent of the adults have a college degree .\nMuch of the poverty today is tucked between the mountains in what are called `` the hollers . '' That 's where Norma Moore lives with her 8-year-old grandson , Brayden . She says his parents did n't want him . He was born with a rare blood disease and is severely disabled . `` And they said he was dying , and then at 4 months I got him , and I 've had him ever since , '' Moore says .\nBrayden does n't walk or talk . He 's in constant motion , rolling on the floor of their double-wide trailer home , bumping into walls and doors .\nThere 's no question that Moore 's life is incredibly stressful . She says she gets by on her faith . But here 's where the war on poverty has also made a big difference : Today , she gets food stamps and energy assistance to heat her home \u2014 programs with roots in Johnson 's anti-poverty initiatives \u2014 as well as Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) for her grandson .\nMoore shakes her head thinking about life without the help . `` I would be homeless . I would be the one living on the street if it was n't for that , '' she says . She looks down at her grandson on the floor . `` He would probably be in a home somewhere . ''\nToday , many people here rely on government aid . In fact , it 's the largest source of income in Martin County . People say it has helped to reduce hunger , improve health care and give young families a boost , especially at a time when coal-mining jobs are disappearing by the hundreds .\nHead Start is one of the signature programs of the war on poverty \u2014 helping low- and moderate-income children get ready for school .
