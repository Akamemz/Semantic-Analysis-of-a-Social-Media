Roosevelt saw the economic collapse as directly analogous to war. In his first inaugural address, he said that Americans \"must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.\"\n\nLike President Woodrow Wilson during World War I, President Roosevelt and his New Dealers moved to cartelize the economy with the enthusiastic support of business executives such as Gerard Swope, president of General Electric. \"There was scarcely a New Deal act or agency that did not owe something to the experience of World War I,\" according to FDR scholar William E.
