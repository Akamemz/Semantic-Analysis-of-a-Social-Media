They expected the candidates to offer voters detailed plans for encouraging job growth.\n\nNow, with the election just three weeks away, many Americans are still scratching their heads, wondering what exactly President Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney would do to improve the economy.\n\nDuring the first presidential debate, the moderator did little to nail down details on the topics that matter most to average people, such as home prices, gasoline, wages, exports and jobs. At tonight's televised town hall meeting at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., at least a few voters will have a chance to ask questions to clarify differences between the candidates on \"real\" economy issues.\n\nHere are five topics that many Americans would like to hear more about:\n\nHelping the housing sector\n\nThe housing sector has been in a depression since 2007. In recent months, some indicators have been turning up, but construction spending is still mostly moving sideways, and home prices generally remain far below 2006 levels.\n\nRomney has not said much about foreclosures and the home-price crash, except in a Las Vegas Review-Journal interview when he said: \"Let it run its course and hit the bottom.\"\n\nObama disagreed, saying in his State of the Union address in January that \"responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.\" He has backed modest programs to slow foreclosures, such as the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).\n\nQuestion No. 1: Given how long the housing crisis has dragged on, is there something more you and the Congress could be doing to help? Please be specific.\n\nHelping consumers cope with gas prices\n\nThis year, consumers have seen crazy swings in gasoline prices, with the average price per gallon shooting up from about $3.25 as the year began to $3.92 just three months later. Then the price fell again, rose again and now is back around $3.75.\n\nIt's tough to set a household budget when you never know how much you're going to pay at the pump. Both candidates agree Americans are too dependent on oil from the Middle East, a region where political instability contributes to price volatility.\n\n\"The plan is to control more of our own energy,\" Obama says.\n\n\"I'm going to take advantage of our energy resources and get us energy independent,\" Romney says.\n\nQuestion No. 2: Every president since Jimmy Carter has been talking about making us energy independent. Is it just beyond the power of a president to do anything about gasoline prices, or do you have a plan that is different from all of those past presidents?\n\nHelping households stay afloat\n\nFood experts warn that grocery prices could be headed higher. Breakfast \u2014 an important meal for children \u2014 is already costing more, with retail prices going up for eggs, bacon, orange juice and milk.\n\nMeanwhile, wages are hardly growing at all. Lots of families already have cut back on their driving, cancelled newspapers and clipped coupons. But until they get raises, budgets are tight.\n\nQuestion No. 3: Is there anything a president can do to help get U.S. wages moving up again?\n\nHelping factories by expanding exports\n\nBoth Obama and his Republican challenger say they want to boost U.S. exports. Selling more goods overseas certainly would be helpful to many U.S. factories.\n\n\"I want to export more products and outsource fewer jobs,\" Obama says.\n\n\"Where other nations are now competing, I want to make sure our goods can go throughout the world,\" Romney says.\n\nQuestion No. 4: You each have expressed support for trade pacts.

In fact, our trade deficit with South Korea is up nearly 25 percent so far this year. Why do you want more free-trade deals?\n\nHelping workers by increasing job training\n\nAbout 3.6 million jobs are open right now in this country. At the same time, about 12 million people are looking for work but getting turned down. Many employers say job seekers just don't have the right skills for the available openings.\n\nBoth Obama and Romney say they want to fix that mismatch by upgrading workers' skills.\n\n\"I'm going to make sure we have the kind of training programs that give people the skills they need for the jobs of today,\" Romney says.\n\n\"I want to give more Americans the chance to get the skills that they need to compete,\" Obama says.\n\nQuestion No. 5: What's the difference between your plans?
