Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNN on Sunday, House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that no president should pardon himself.\n\nWhy would Mr Trump need to pardon himself?\n\nIt all stems from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials in the election campaign that brought the president to power.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Donald Trump has constantly railed against the investigation in Twitter outbursts\n\nMr Trump has always maintained there was no collusion and that the investigation is a \"witch hunt\".\n\nPart of Mr Mueller's investigation is looking at whether Mr Trump sought to criminally obstruct it, in particular with the sacking of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, and with his reaction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the investigation.\n\nSo could he do it?\n\nNo-one really knows. There is no precedent for a president trying.\n\nIn the case of former President Richard Nixon, the Justice Department said he could not pardon himself, but others argue it is not precluded in the US Constitution.\n\nThis latter theory was something touched on in the newly leaked letter.\n\nSo what is this letter all about?\n\nIt is dated 29 January and was sent to Mr Mueller by John Dowd, one of Mr Trump's lawyers who has since left the team.\n\nThe New York Times obtained the letter and published it in full.\n\nIt appears to be an attempt to show the president as untouchable. Its main points are that, because the president is the nation's chief legal officer, he:\n\nCannot be subpoenaed\n\nCannot be indicted\n\nCannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because, given his absolute powers, that would effectively mean obstructing himself\n\nCiting the powers given to him by the Constitution, it says the president can \"terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon\".\n\nMr Giuliani said himself last week that the special counsel's investigation may be \"entirely illegitimate\".\n\nThe leaking of the letter certainly displeased Mr Trump:\n\nBut that was dated a while back and the probe is still going?\n\nIt is indeed. Robert Mueller is not going away.\n\nHe has requested an interview with the president over obstruction of justice. Mr Trump has previously said he might be willing to attend but his lawyers appear opposed, fearing it could lead to charges of perjury.\n\nMr Giuliani told ABC: \"It's beginning to get resolved in favour of not doing it.\"\n\nIf the president does not attend, Mr Mueller could try a grand jury subpoena but, as the letter above shows, the Trump team would try to block it.\n\nThe whole thing could end in a court battle over what can and what cannot be applied to a president.\n\nIn any case, any attempt to impeach the president over the Russia affair would not be affected.
