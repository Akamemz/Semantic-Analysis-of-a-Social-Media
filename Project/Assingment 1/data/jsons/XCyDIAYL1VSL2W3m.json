Trey Gowdy , from the indignant prosecutorial style he employs in Capitol Hill hearings to his three dogs , aptly named Judge , Jury and Bailiff .\nRepublicans and Democrats alike say the second-term South Carolina Republican is the right man to head the special congressional investigation into Benghazi , a job that could springboard him into positions such as attorney general or service in a Republican presidential administration . But they also say the forthright former prosecutor isn \u2019 t likely to cut corners on the investigation to score political points or raise his profile .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve put a lot of kids through law school , and there \u2019 s just some people who can do it and some people [ who ] can \u2019 t , \u201d said Dave Woodard , a political science professor at Clemson University who has served as an adviser to Mr. Gowdy . \u201c And he \u2019 s one that could . Extremely well-prepared but very effective in the courtroom . And that \u2019 s where he built his reputation . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John A.

We \u2019 re going to go wherever the facts take us , \u201d Mr. Gowdy said . \u201c Facts are neither Republican nor Democrat . They are facts . And if we overplay our hand or if we engage in a process that is not fair according to the American people , we will be punished as we should be for that . \u201d\nMr. Gowdy gained attention over the past year for his tough questioning during House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigations into the Obama administration .

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , and her aides have not tipped their hand on a decision .\nMr. Davis , who led a select committee investigating the government \u2019 s response to Hurricane Katrina , said Democratic leaders boycotted the inquiry , so he invited Gulf Coast lawmakers to join independently .\nThe Benghazi panel will look into the policy and security questions surrounding the September 2012 attack on the U.S. outpost in Libya that resulted in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans .\nMr. Gowdy made his first stumble by portraying the investigation as a trial and the White House as the defendant . He conceded on Fox that perhaps he needed to get out of a 16-year habit of speaking in trial metaphors .\nRep. Gerald E. Connolly , a Virginia Democrat who serves with Mr. Gowdy on the House oversight panel , said the trial analogy gave him pause .\nAfter congratulating Mr. Gowdy on the appointment , Mr. Connolly recalled , \u201c I said , \u2018 You have a choice . This is an opportunity for you to make your mark as a fair and balanced chairman who \u2019 s capable of resisting the baser pressures from your echo chamber on the right and rise to the occasion and show some stature , or you can be remembered as just another flack who ran it in a partisan fashion with very little credibility who came and went . \u201d\nMr. Connolly hastened to add that he has a good working relationship with Mr. Gowdy and wasn \u2019 t trying to be confrontational .\n\u201c But I was saying you \u2019 ve got two clear paths , and it matters which one you choose , \u201d he said . \u201c I like Trey Gowdy , and we \u2019 ve become very friendly and we have jousted , but done it in a civil and mutually respectful way , and we \u2019 ll see whether we have an opportunity to expand on that . \u201d\nMr. Woodard met Mr. Gowdy before his first political run for solicitor , South Carolina \u2019 s equivalent to a district attorney , in 2000 .
