    "content": "Throughout the Republican primaries , Donald Trump carved out stances that broke with longtime GOP orthodoxy . As a businessman who sometimes expressed support for Democrats and for positions favored by liberals in his home state of New York , Trump promised he would be an unconventional president capable of taking positions all along the political spectrum .\nBut since he was elected President , Trump has named Cabinet members who hew closely to what Republicans have advocated for decades . In fact , it 's starting to look a lot like Christmas for the Republican Party .\nFor all the talk about how Trump would defy the Republican Party and challenge the status quo , his Cabinet picks have been remarkably consistent -- and conservative . It should have become clear when Trump announced that Vice President-elect Mike Pence , a staunch right-wing conservative who has been a strong opponent of abortion rights as well as LGBT rights , also skeptical of climate change and a champion of creationism , would take over the transition from New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie .\nThe recent announcement that US Rep. Tom Price , an ardent opponent of Obamacare , will head the Department of Health and Human Services is just one more piece of evidence that Trump will govern with a rightward team of conservatives surrounding him . Trump apparently is aiming to build a new Republican coalition that combines blue-collar workers with the rest of the existing conservative establishment .\nSome Republican commentators are still acting as if things are up in the air . In his most recent column , David Brooks of The New York Times said that Trump is a threat to the party loyalty that has dominated American politics . `` He is hostile to the Republican establishment , '' Brooks wrote . `` His proposals cut across orthodox partisan lines . ''\nIf people are waiting for him to moderate or for his presidency to cause a major rupture in the GOP , they might be waiting for a long time . Everything so far suggests he is planning to make some pretty radical moves to reverse most of President Barack Obama 's policies and to go even further than that . For all the pleasantries that have been uttered between Trump and Obama , this President-elect is clearly is rightward-bound .\nThe early announcements about his appointments set a clear tone . With `` alt-right `` favorite Steve Bannon as his senior adviser and Reince Preibus , who headed the Republican National Committee , as his chief of staff , Trump instantly put into place figures who could appeal to congressional Republicans , the conservative media and right-wing organizations that hover around sites such as Breitbart.com .\nThen Trump went even further . He announced that Sen. Jeff Sessions , an ardent opponent of voting rights and a fierce adversary of legal and illegal immigrants , such as opposing giving visas to many high-skilled workers , would head the Justice Department . That sent a clear signal to most people in Washington about the direction his policies would take . With Michael Flynn , a retired lieutenant general , as his national security adviser , he has turned to someone who has argued that Islamism is a `` vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people '' and that it must be `` excised . ''\nUS Rep. Mike Pompeo , a conservative who was a driving force in the Benghazi investigation , heading the CIA sets up the agency to support an extremely aggressive stance in how the war on terrorism will be conducted .\nSouth Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley , nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations , came into politics as a tea party Republican , endorsed by Sarah Palin in her run for governor , and has an extremely conservative voting record on almost every issue . To be sure , she lowered the Confederate flag from the state Capitol after horrendous racially charged shootings in South Carolina , but that is a long way from establishing that she is a moderate in general .\nBetsy DeVos , who will be the secretary of education , is one of the most prominent and fervent advocates of using federal money for charter schools . She also comes from a family that has donated enormous amounts of money to all sorts of conservative causes , effectively the Koch brothers of the Midwest .\nThe transportation secretary-to-be , Elaine Chao , the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , had a solid , anti-union record when she was secretary of labor under President George W. Bush . Chao is well-networked in the most `` establishment '' Republican circles of Washington .\nAs labor secretary , she drew criticism from Democrats for failing to investigate complaints from workers or to promote new health regulations . When 12 miners died in the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia , critics argued she had not conducted sufficient safety inspections in mines .\nSome of the lower-level appointments have also sent congressional Republicans strong signals about where the administration will go . The announcement that KT McFarland , a former national security official and Fox News analyst , as deputy national security adviser pleased many hawks given her confrontational stands against Russia and , even more importantly , extremely tough posture toward Iran . While at Fox , McFarland responded to the terrorist attack in Brussels , Belgium , by saying that `` political correctness '' is `` getting us killed '' by preventing the United States from rounding up Muslims . `` Either bomb Iran , or let Iran get the bomb , '' she also said in a statement of her policy toward the region .\nBringing Price on board to head the HHS is an equally radical statement . Getting rid of Obamacare has been at the top of the list for many Republicans since it was passed . Price has never been shy about his positions on the program . `` Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration blatantly ignored the voices of the American people and rammed through a hyperpartisan piece of legislation that will have a disastrous effect on our nation 's health care system , '' the congressman said in 2010 . Unlike some Republicans , Price has not softened his views since the program went into effect .\nWhile it will be difficult for congressional Republicans to make a direct assault on Obamacare in the coming year , the other way in which a conservative administration can effectively gut a policy is to put an opponent in charge of the agency that administers it .\nThis was Ronald Reagan 's strategy for much of the 1980s : undermine federal programs from within . That 's why Reagan had Clarence Thomas , an opponent of affirmative action , head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or James Watt , an anti-environmentalist , as secretary of interior . With Price making big decisions about who should administer the program and how to direct resources within his agency , the Affordable Care Act will be vulnerable from day one even if it remains on the books .\nEven the so-called possible Team of Rivals appointments must be taken with a grain of salt . The possible appointment of Mitt Romney to be secretary of state has now become the chief question about whether Trump really wants a team of rivals and seeks to broaden his party .\nWhile it is true that Romney headed the anti-Trump effort within the GOP and there is no love lost between these men , a quick look at Romney 's 2012 campaign is reminder of how far to the right he is willing to go when it suits his political purposes . Romney was extremely hawkish in his positions about Iran , remaining an opponent of any kind of nuclear deal , and surrounded himself with advisers who made extreme statements about the threats from Islam . He told voters that he could wage a war on Iran without congressional approval . Although he differs from Trump in being more confrontational with Russia , something that would please most conservatives , there are not so many differences between them .\nAnother alternative would be to name retired Gen. David Petraeus to be secretary of state . Notwithstanding the controversy this will generate given his own classification scandal , having him at State , with Flynn at the National Security Council and possibly Marine Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary -- breaking a 65-year tradition of not having military men in that role -- would stack much of foreign policy with officials oriented toward the use of force rather than steeped in diplomacy to handle relations overseas .\nWhen it comes to the Koch brothers , they have a lot to be excited about . While they stayed far away from Trump during the campaign , the President-elect is making a number of appointments of loyal Koch acolytes to his team . As Politico reported , his transition team as well as several administration picks have tapped into the Koch world , including White House counsel Don McGahn to transition team executive members such as Rebekah Mercer . Another Politico article noted how despite the President-elect 's populist campaign Wall Street bankers and traders are celebrating the transition period as many major investors , from Wilbur Ross ( expected to be the secretary of commerce ) to Steven Mnuchin ( secretary of treasury ) , have been coming in and out of meetings at the Trump White House-in-waiting on Fifth Avenue .\nSo for all the talk about divisions within the GOP and Trump 's unorthodox policy position , this is really looking like a very traditional Republican administration , and one that will veer to the right , not the center , on domestic and foreign policy .\nWith Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress , the GOP will be in a strong position to move public policy in pretty dramatic fashion over the coming two years . And with Democrats defending more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018 , the policymaking window might be even bigger for this president than others have enjoyed in the past .",
