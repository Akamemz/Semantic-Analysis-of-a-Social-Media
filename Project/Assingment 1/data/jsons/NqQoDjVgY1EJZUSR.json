Mitch McConnell , statistically tied with his Democratic opponent in one of the most closely watched Senate races in America , never misses an opportunity to blast \u201c Obamacare \u201d : on the hustings in his home state of Kentucky and on the floor of the US Senate , where he serves as the minority leader .\nBut Obamacare may not turn out to be the campaign issue that Senator McConnell hopes it will be . True , Kentuckians \u2013 like most Americans \u2013 disapprove of the Affordable Care Act .
