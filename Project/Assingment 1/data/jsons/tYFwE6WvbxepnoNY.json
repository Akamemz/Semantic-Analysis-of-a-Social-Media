    "content": "But Trump and some of his aides have backed away from their own guidelines , opting instead to hail the broad economic reopening that health experts say has started too quickly . The dichotomy comes as the White House also tried to distance itself from a draft federal government report predicting an explosion of new coronavirus cases and 3,000 daily deaths by June 1 .\nIt underscores how an eagerness by Trump and several state governors to begin restarting normal activities after a weeks-long economic slowdown has clashed with a stubbornly high national caseload that has defied the president \u2019 s predictions of a swift and safe reopening . It also marks another round of confusing guidance from Trump , who released the guidelines with fanfare during a briefing and now shows no problem with states that ignore them .\n\u201c There \u2019 s not too many states that I know of that are going up . Almost everybody is headed in the right direction , \u201d Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Sunday , in which he presented a misleading and rosy assessment of the crisis . \u201c We \u2019 re on the right side of it , but we want to keep it that way , but we also want to get back to work . \u201d\nIn reality , new coronavirus cases are increasing in about a third of states , compared with just a few where there has been a sustained decline . A plurality of states are hovering around the same level , with neither a significant uptick nor decrease in daily cases . That mirrors the national trend , as the rate of new cases has leveled off in recent weeks but not declined .\nAshish Jha , director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , said most governors who have decided to open up are clearly not following the letter of the White House guidelines .\n\u201c The first part of the criteria is sustained decline . And we don \u2019 t see that , \u201d Jha said .\nTo date , 1.2 million people have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 68,000 have died in the United States . Both figures are widely believed to undercount the actual totals .\nThe White House continues to support its guidelines but wants local officials to take the lead in deciding how quickly to ease restrictions , according to a senior administration official , who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations . While individual states \u2019 decisions to move more quickly than recommended under the White House guidelines are regularly discussed during coronavirus task force meetings , those decisions are not seen as defiant toward the Trump administration , the official said .\nOne reason could be that Trump rarely discusses his own guidelines , instead encouraging states to move quickly to reverse the economic calamity that took hold as governors imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus . Trump has expressed support for protesters pushing their states to end the orders and tweeted about a need to \u201c LIBERATE \u201d several states \u2014 including places that White House guidelines indicate should remain in a state of lockdown .\nPolitically , governors have come to learn they are more likely to be criticized by Trump for maintaining stay-at-home orders that comply with White House guidelines than they are for opening up their economies before meeting the Trump administration \u2019 s own criteria for doing so .\nTrump has singled out Virginia for its reluctance to quickly ease social distancing measures , telling Fox News that it was one of the states that \u201c aren \u2019 t going fast enough . \u201d\nEven though the number of coronavirus cases in Virginia continues to rise , Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam ( D ) announced Monday that he would probably begin easing the state \u2019 s restrictions on May 15 \u2014 including by allowing some gatherings of more than 10 people if social distancing protocols are met .\n\u201c As you can see , our cases continue to rise , \u201d he said , before adding that the state \u2019 s percentage of positive tests \u2014 another key measure in the White House guidelines \u2014 had begun to decline .\nTrump \u2019 s light criticism of Georgia \u2019 s decision to begin opening up businesses including barbershops and bowling alleys before meeting White House benchmarks was short-lived .\nWhile the president said on April 23 , he was \u201c not happy \u201d with Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp ( R ) for the defying the guidelines , it took him only a week to deny his own remarks .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t say that , \u201d Trump said Friday when his quote about Kemp was read back to him . \u201c I said I didn \u2019 t like the particular place \u2014 a spa , a tattoo parlor . No , no , I think it \u2019 s wonderful . \u201d\nAs Trump leads the nation \u2019 s push for a quick economic reopening , some administration officials have continued to call on states to follow the White House \u2019 s detailed guidelines .\nAnthony S. Fauci , the nation \u2019 s top infectious-disease expert , has repeatedly warned governors against moving too quickly to lift restrictions , saying he was concerned that states that flout the White House guidelines could spark a resurgence of the virus .\n\u201c The guidelines are very , very explicit , and very clear , \u201d he said last week on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d show . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of leeway because we give the governors the opportunity to be very flexible , but you have to have the core principles of the guidelines . You can \u2019 t just leap over things and get into a situation where you \u2019 re really tempting a rebound . \u201d\nDeborah Birx , the White House coronavirus task force coordinator , has also called on states and localities to follow the administration \u2019 s guidelines but has stopped short of contradicting Trump \u2019 s push for governors to move as quickly as possible to return to normal .\n\u201c We made it very clear that the guidelines are based on very strong evidence and data , \u201d she said Sunday on Fox News . \u201c We \u2019 ve made it clear what the gating criteria is . \u201d\nIn Texas , for instance , new cases dipped in mid-April but have lately been on the rise , with a spike late last week to more than 1,000 daily that has brought the total to more than 32,000 . Nonetheless , Gov . Greg Abbott ( R ) went ahead with a plan to reopen the state \u2019 s stores , restaurants , movie theaters and malls provided they operate at less than 25 percent capacity .\nLauren Ancel Meyers , a University of Texas at Austin biologist who has modeled possible trend lines in the state \u2019 s capital as social distancing requirements are eased , said much will depend on how vigilant people remain with social distancing .\nModels of potential transmission in Austin that she has run range anywhere from \u201c hardly any additional hospitalizations \u201d to \u201c a catastrophic second wave . \u201d\nTennessee Gov . Bill Lee ( R ) let his stay-at-home order expire last week and replaced it with a far less restrictive set of rules that allow restaurants , shops and fitness centers to open in nearly all parts of the state . Hair and nail salons , which weren \u2019 t part of the original reopening , will be allowed to begin service again this week . That \u2019 s despite the fact that new cases have jumped in recent days and now total more than 13,000 .\nSome public officials have been unnerved at the speed with which the reopening has happened and the apparent disregard for guidelines set by medical experts .\n\u201c The state policymakers believe that the economic climate is more important than those guidelines , \u201d said Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke ( D ) . \u201c I don \u2019 t see any other explanation . \u201d\nBut as states have defied that criteria to begin restarting business activity \u2014 from retail stores in Colorado to restaurants in Florida to elective surgeries in Ohio \u2014 they have been cheered on by Trump and his allies .\nVice President Pence has hailed the 41 states that have announced or began plans for reopening .\nBut some of those states have pushed ahead with reopening plans that skip ahead of the White House \u2019 s recommended phased approach .

We don \u2019 t have the contact tracing . We can \u2019 t detect a rebound , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s a really problematic place to be . This is not where we want to be . \u201d\nAli Khan , dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska , said the governors are clearly reacting to \u201c shelter-in-place fatigue \u201d as they skirt the guidelines .
