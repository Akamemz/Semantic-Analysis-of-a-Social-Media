So he \u2019 s the one to aim at , \u201d said Feinstein who supports Biden over fellow California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris .\n\u201c He will be among the frontrunners , \u201d said Rep.

Younger , more left-leaning voters in particular are likely to be skeptical \u2014 especially when they see with their own eyes Biden \u2019 s conduct or liberal apostasies . But many Democrats are not as fire-breathing as those on Twitter , and having a cadre of senior party figures will help him in his pursuit of the nomination .\nAlready , it seems Biden \u2019 s rivals have moved on from his interactions with women to his lengthy record , with stories surfacing about his resistance to busing to integrate schools , past opposition to some abortion rights and comments like his Thursday praise for former Florida Republican Gov . Jeb Bush .\nSuch is the nature of being a frontrunner , and Biden is in some ways an easy target as a garrulous politician who got his start in another era . He served in the Senate for 36 years , spanning Democratic generations that shifted from a more ideologically diverse party with a real conservative wing to one where moderates are all but extinct from Capitol Hill .\nClyburn , the highest-ranking African American in Congress , has not endorsed any 2020 candidate , but he \u2019 s a long-time Biden ally and is eager to defend him .\nClyburn noted in an interview that Biden had been invited to eulogize former South Carolina Sens . Strom Thurmond and Fritz Hollings , who just died this month . Thurmond switched parties and revolted against Democrats \u2019 embrace of integration , while Hollings , another Democrat , became a civil rights supporter .\n\u201c Two extremes , but Joe Biden seems to be the bridge between those two . That \u2019 s what he brings into this discussion , that \u2019 s what he brings into this presidential campaign , \u201d Clyburn said . \u201c You will see people all over the place who support Joe Biden because there \u2019 s something about Joe Biden that \u2019 s a little bit different . \u201d\n\u201c He may be the most compassionate , caring public official I \u2019 ve ever worked with , \u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) . \u201c It is natural that he would get a positive response from people even if they think that a specific act of his may be suspect or questioned . \u201d\nThat reaction may be more crucial for Biden than any other candidate . It \u2019 s inarguable that Biden is gaffe-prone . Even in his attempt to acknowledge social norms have changed around invading women \u2019 s personal space , he joked about getting permission to touch kids .\nA \u201c very poor \u201d joke , said Sen. Jon Tester ( D-Mont . ) who nonetheless defended Biden in an interview .\n\u201c Very poor . He \u2019 s got ta be smarter than that . He can \u2019 t make light of it . Not now . Not when all this shit \u2019 s gone on , \u201d Tester said .\nSome Republicans are ready to exploit Biden 's weaknesses , despite Trump \u2018 s own issues with women voters .\nBiden `` should be held accountable for it . And I got the impression that the vice president thinks he didn \u2019 t do anything wrong and still doesn \u2019 t , '' said Sen. John Kennedy ( R-La . ) .\nOthers had a different view . Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) spoke to Biden last week after Manchin had gone on TV to defend Biden amid a wave of negative stories . Manchin told Biden to hold steady .\n\u201c I just said : \u2018 Joe , you \u2019 ve just got to be you . They can \u2019 t change you . The people who love you , love you because of who you are , not who they think you have to be or who they want you to be , \u2019 \u201d Manchin recounted in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on C-SPAN \u2019 s \u201c Newsmakers . \u201d\nYet even with the new scrutiny of Biden \u2019 s record , his support in the polls and among Democratic elected officials has not dropped . Clyburn said Biden is staffing up in South Carolina , a key early state , while several senators said Biden is still expected to jump into the race this month .\nIf there is a knock on the Biden brigade , it \u2019 s that the group does not come from the young , dynamic wing of the party . Feinstein , Coons and Sen. Tom Carper ( D-Del . ) are more centrist than most Senate Democrats , and Manchin is reviled by liberals ( and he won \u2019 t endorse Biden yet , anyway . ) Clyburn can offer Biden strong defenses from a unique place as the most senior black official in Congress , but he \u2019 s 78 and represents the old guard .\nYet no other White House hopeful has such a broad congressional coalition as Biden , who can likely count House members and senators like Doug Jones of Alabama to align with him once he gets in the race . The candidate most closely trailing him in the polls , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , has a fraction of the support in the party establishment that Biden has . Few rose to Sanders \u2019 defense amid criticism that he \u2019 s been to slow to release his tax returns , particularly in comparison to when Biden has faced a backlash .\n\u201c Longstanding relationships with people who know you , who know who you are and what you stand for , always gives you credibility , \u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell ( D-Mich. ) . Biden eulogized her husband , former Rep. John Dingell \u2014 the longest serving lawmaker in history \u2014 earlier this year .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not meaning to make a comparison , \u201d Coons said . But \u201c among the two dozen [ Senate Democrats ] who did serve with him , at least half of them are being advocates for him . \u201d\nEven some of Trump \u2019 s closest allies will struggle to attack Biden , particularly those that served with him in the Senate .\nSen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) said he expected to speak to Biden by phone soon and said that Biden will be \u201c very challenging \u201d to beat .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll stand up for Joe as a person . I \u2019 m not going to vote for him . I hope he \u2019 s not president . But he \u2019 s one of the most decent people I \u2019 ve ever met , \u201d Graham said .\nThough Graham is sure to be one of Trump \u2019 s most enthusiastic backers , he didn \u2019 t sound all that different from Carper , who is ready to dig in on Biden \u2019 s behalf for the next 18 months .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure that there will be plenty of people that will be coming at him on all kinds of different issues . That \u2019 s OK , \u201d Carper said . \u201c We need somebody who can win , defeat Donald Trump . \u2026 He \u2019 s the guy . \u201d",
