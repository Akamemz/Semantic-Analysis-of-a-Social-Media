That was 915 days ago.\n\nFrom the moment the last of the 22 pens he used to sign the bill into law left the parchment, the federal government has been gearing up \u2014 and, of course, collecting cash \u2014 for Day One, non-ironically set 915 days in the future, Oct. 1, 2013.\n\nIn the meantime, though, the community organizer from Chicagoland exempted everyone in his administration from the new law (as well as lawmakers and staffers in Congress). Lots of campaign donors and business buddies in blue states got waivers, too. But everyone else has to fall in line and get set for the federal government to gain an unfathomable degree of control over their lives.\n\nWell, not everyone. Months ago, the government that could hardly administer a Cash for Clunkers program had to bail on the \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d pushing the start date back to Oct. 1, 2015. That means businesses with more than 50 full-time employees are exempt from Obamacare.\n\nBut small businesses, the backbone of the American economy, are still forced to comply with the regressive law. The Wal-Marts and Best Buys and Olive Gardens escaped the government maw, but not the most vulnerable, entrepreneurial companies (which don\u2019t have million-dollar lobbyists eating stuffed shrimp with fat-cat lawmakers every night). Oh, and you have to enroll, too. No ifs, ands or buts.\n\nSo, your federal government has been in overdrive for 915 days, with millions of workers readying your new health care.

The administration announced that in 2014 businesses that use the exchanges will have only one available plan to cover employees \u2014 not a single alternative. So much for the president\u2019s vow of choice and competition.
