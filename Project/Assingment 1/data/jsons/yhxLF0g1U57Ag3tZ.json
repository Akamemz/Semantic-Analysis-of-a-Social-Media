Even arguments about annual military \u201c cuts \u201d are not really about cuts , but rather about the pace of the Pentagon \u2019 s growth compared to previous years . There is no question that sequestration would hurt the Pentagon budget , but it was intended as a doomsday device precisely because no one believed Congress and the president would allow the military to sustain such cuts .\nBottom line : The military gets more money , more respect , more bipartisan adulation from America \u2019 s leaders , than any other institution in the United States .\nSo what exactly is Governor Romney \u2019 s beef ? He claims that President Obama intends to cut more than one trillion dollars from the military budget . He points to a quote from former Defense Secretary Gates that such cuts would be \u201c devastating \u201d and wants to guarantee military spending at four percent of GDP . But let \u2019 s check the facts : half of that \u201c trillion \u201d are caps in 10-year projected growth rates in the defense budget that Republicans and Democrats ( and Pentagon leadership ) agreed to in the Budget Control Act . The proposed budget does not \u201c cut \u201d defense , but instead just lowers the rate of growth to keep up with inflation The other $ 500 billion are cuts from the sequester , which the Republicans supported in the Budget Control Act\nPresident Obama established a balanced strategy to guide military spending .
