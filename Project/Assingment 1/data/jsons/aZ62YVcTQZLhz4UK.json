''\nThe following September , a 17-year-old unaccompanied illegal immigrant girl identified only as `` Jane Doe '' wanted to get an abortion . She ended up getting her abortion , but her case pushed the question into the national spotlight . Three other immigrant girls , known only by the monickers `` Jane Poe , '' `` Jane Roe , '' and `` Jane Moe , '' soon followed with lawsuits of their own against the Trump administration .\nIn March 2018 , a judge issued an injunction preventing immigration authorities from keeping Doe , or any unaccompanied illegal immigrant minors , from receiving abortions .\nLast June , the Supreme Court ruled that the case initially filed by Jane Doe had become irrelevant since she had already had an abortion . Because of this , the high court did not rule on the underlying question of whether or not other illegal immigrant minors should be allowed to get abortions , but it did allow the suits to continue making their way through the lower courts , Reuters reported , in order to determine the outcome for other immigrants who were in similar situations .\nOn Friday , a panel of three judges on the D.C . Circuit Court unanimously upheld a lower court decision by ruling that the federal government did not have a right to prevent unaccompanied minors from getting abortions .\nAccording to Reuters , roughly 50,000 unaccompanied minors illegally entered the country and were moved to detention centers by U.S. immigration officials in 2018 .
