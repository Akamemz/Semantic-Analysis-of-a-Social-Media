From Spying on Congress: \u201cJust as disturbing as the revelation that the NSA is spying on members of Congress is the fear of what the NSA does with the information it collects\u2026 The lawlessness continues. The president\u2019s NSA spies remain out of control. They are spying on Congress and the courts; the military and the press; the CIA and other spies; friends, foes and the Pope.

Chris Christie, R-N.J., will hold a press conference this morning to answer the media uproar over newly revealed emails that show members of his staff intentionally caused traffic nightmares as payback to one of Christie\u2019s political foes. In a statement, Christie said he was misled by a member of his staff and is \u201coutraged and deeply saddened\u201d after newly released emails appear to show his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly tried to create traffic gridlock in Fort Lee, N.J.. The string of e-mails published by the NYT reveal gleeful discussions Kelly had about the success of lane closures on the George Washington Bridge last September in retaliation for Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's refusal to endorse Christie\u2019s 2013 re-election bid. Christie maintains the behavior was \u201cunsanctioned\u201d and promises to hold people \u201cresponsible for their actions.\u201d Fox News has more.\n\n[Watch Fox: Christie meets the press at 11 a.m. ET today.]\n\nThe swarm - Like a New York pro athlete, Christie has a much higher profile nationally because of his proximity to the pulsating core of American media. But like the sometimes sensations over the Yankees or Jets, there can be a high price. The New York area media is in overdrive over the bridge flap, the NY Daily News calling it \u201cChristie\u2019s Waterloo\u201d and declaring conclusively that it will end Christie\u2019s career as a national figure, one way or another. Democrats have wasted no time jumping on the opportunity to use the issue to taint the potential 2016 GOP presidential contender\u2019s image as a bipartisan problem solver. But as long as the popular New Jersey governor isn\u2019t personally connected to the alleged local dirty tricks and his outrage is proven sincere, this will more likely be a data point in his rivals\u2019 inevitable character attacks on the brash boss.\n\n[Watch Fox: Correspondent Eric Shawn is following the latest developments in the Bridge-gate controversy.]\n\nWill it stick? - GOP Strategist Mike Murphy weighs the potential long term damage to Christie\u2019s nascent presidential campaign in a NY Daily News OpEd, \u201cThe story is irresistible to the political press\u2026 because the idea of New Jersey\u2019s bombastic governor dropping the gridlocking equivalent of a nuclear weapon on a small-time mayor easily fits a lazy narrative about Christie having a vindictive side\u2026 My prediction? The whole thing will blow over. Sure, the media will howl for a week and the mayor of Fort Lee will spend the next two years darkly plotting ways to poison Christie\u2019s good name in New Hampshire. But Christie has already blasted the main chortling staffer in question. The circus will move on.\u201d\n\nHistory repeating - Fox News Radio\u2019s White House Correspondent Mike Majchrowitz points out the historical precedent for bridge battles in the New York region\u2019s politics. Majchrowitz shares Mason William\u2019s work \u201cCity of Ambition\u201d which details a doozy of a battle involving President Franklin Roosevelt and New York Mayor Fiorello LaGaurdia over the Triborough Bridge during the Depression. LaGaurdia had appointed a bitter personal enemy of Roosevelt, Robert Moses, to a board that oversaw the construction of the construction of the bridge. Things got so tense that Public Works Administrator Harold Ickes summoned LaGaurdia to Washington to push Moses\u2019 removal from the board or risk federal funding that would put the project in jeopardy.
