Jeb Bush \u2019 sdebut speech \u2014 on February 4th , in Detroit , the start of of his \u201c Right To Rise \u201d tour \u2014 took on heightened importance .\nPresidential campaigns are about much more than name recognition , r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , charisma , and money . All of these matter . Yet\u2026\nPurpose matters more . The electorate , not the elite , will decide , after interviewing the contenders throughout the primaries and then in the general election , who gets to occupy the Oval Office . And we voters want to , and get to , know what our candidates are promising for us before we hire them .\nThus it is uncommonly important that Jeb Bush \u2019 s first major speech as an aspirant was firmly grounded in the supply side vision of mutual prosperity . Governor Bush presented supply side economics more capably , and more emphatically , than any presidential contender since Ronald Reagan used it in 1980 to blow past Governor Bush \u2019 s father to secure the Republican presidential nomination . And then to blow past the hapless incumbent Jimmy Carter to inaugurate Morning in America .\nThere are important specifics still to be spelled out . Bush \u2019 s continuing viability depends on the specifics of what he will offer . Still , in his first at bat in the World Series of politics Bush hit a home run .\nThere is a lot to love in his speech . For me and for some other supply siders the coup de gr\u00e2ce came here :\nGrowth above all . A growing economy , whether here in Detroit or throughout this country is the difference between poverty and prosperity for millions . If you want to close the opportunity gap , grow the economy . This is a principle that concentrates the mind . If a law or a rule doesn \u2019 t contribute to growth , why do it ? If a law subtracts from growth , why are we discussing it ? And for what it \u2019 s worth , I don \u2019 t think the US should settle for anything less than 4 % growth a year \u2013 which is about twice our current average . At that rate , the middle class will thrive again . And in the coming months , I intend to detail how we can get there , with a mix of smart policies and reforms to tap our resources and capacity to innovate , whether in energy , manufacturing , health care or technology .\nThe fact that Bush recognizes the possibility and implications of of a 4 % rate of economic growth is extraordinary . Economic growth is not merely the best way . It is the only way to let the middle class thrive .\nThe \u201c right to rise \u201d almost certainly , absent a major foreign policy crisis , will be the issue on which Election 2016 will be fought out .

Reagan experienced a 7 % year -- and a 4.9 % average -- rebounding out of a recession . And as I previously have written :\n$ 6 trillion in new federal revenues is just the byproduct of 4 % economic growth . Of even greater importance : an economy generating more ( and better ) jobs than there are workers . That could cut the Gordian knot of immigration reform : America will be yearning for more immigrants , documented or not . 4 % growth ( somewhat less , actually ) makes Social Security and Medicare solvent for as far as the eye can see .\nBy declaring \u201c growth above all \u201d Bush covered the first essential requirement of a major presidential aspirant .
