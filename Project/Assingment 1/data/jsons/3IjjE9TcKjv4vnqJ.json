    "content": "Romney Softens Rhetoric , If Not Policies , In Speech To Latino Leaders\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney softened his tough primary-campaign tone on immigration , if not his positions , during a speech Thursday to national Hispanic leaders .\nIn comments to thousands gathered at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando , Fla. , the former Massachusetts governor criticized President Obama 's failure to take action on comprehensive immigration reform .\nAnd he characterized Obama 's decision last week to bypass Congress and defer deportation of many young illegal immigrants as an election-year sop to Hispanic voters .\nThe president 's action , Romney said , is `` a temporary measure that he seems to think will be just enough to get him through the election . ''\n`` After 3 1/2 years of putting every issue \u2014 from loan guarantees for his donors to cash for clunkers \u2014 before immigration , now the president has been seized by an overwhelming need to do what he could have done on Day One , '' Romney said . `` I think you deserve better . ''\nBefore last week 's action , Obama had resisted calls to use his executive authority to halt deportations of young illegal immigrants and allow them to apply for legal work permits . He 's scheduled to speak Friday at the 29th annual conference \u2014 the first sitting president to do so .\nHe 'll come in riding a wave of Hispanic support for last week 's action , a move that polls suggest has strong support as well from the nation at large .
