He is starting to look beyond the present crisis . \u201c Some of these things you \u2019 re doing now , these are things we should do all the time . \u201d\nOut in the community , many seniors have also become cut off from personal contact with family or friends , adding to the risk of isolation . But there are many creative ways to stay in touch , and community organizations and volunteers are going all out to ease the isolation of a lockdown .\nResidents in nursing homes are among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic . It \u2019 s not just the immediate threat of a disease that disproportionately afflicts the elderly and vulnerable . In order to slow infection rates , nursing facilities have had to bar visitors and end communal activities , and that exacts its own toll on older people who are struggling with isolation and loneliness .\nJulia Adams looked forward to two family outings a week : Thursday dinner and Sunday lunch . That changed last month when the 80-year-old \u2019 s assisted living home in New Middletown , Ohio , closed to visitors as a COVID-19 precaution .\n\u201c Mom had kept asking about going out to dinner , \u201d says her son Charley Adams . \u201c I just had to keep telling her : \u2018 Mom , you can \u2019 t leave , and I can \u2019 t come in . \u2019 \u201d\nHe could hear her disappointment on the phone . The facility has arranged Skype sessions to help families connect , he says , but he does n't know how to use it . So one Sunday he took matters into his own hands .\nMr. Adams , who owns a tree service business , went home to get his bucket truck . It extends 55 feet into the air , more than enough to reach his mom \u2019 s 3rd floor window .\n\u201c I called her on her phone \u2013 she had her blinds closed \u2013 and I said , Look out your window , Mom . \u201d\n\u201c Oh , it was wonderful , \u201d says Ms. Adams on a call from her room . She says her son \u2019 s surprise appearance was a big hit with the other residents , too .\nCourtesy of Corrie Adams Charley Adams visits his 80-year-old mom , Julia Adams , at her assisted living home in New Middletown , Ohio , on March 22 , 2020 . Mr. Adams has used his bucket truck to keep connected with his mom during the pandemic .\nSenior care organizations are scrambling to stave off the novel coronavirus as related deaths at these facilities mount \u2013 more than 3,600 according to the latest count from the Associated Press . Residents in nursing and retirement homes are considered particularly vulnerable because of their age , and many have underlying health conditions .\nStaff , too , are affected . Last week , a nursing home in Riverside , California , had to be evacuated because staff were too frightened to work . Dozens of residents , including employees , had tested positive for COVID-19 .\nYet as these facilities bar visitors , group activities , and communal dining , staff and families are finding creative ways to ease the isolation of elderly residents , from virtual pet therapy to window weddings . Ideally , that stream of love and dedication should continue even after the pandemic , say experts , who point out that seniors in an aging nation already struggle with isolation and loneliness .\n\u201c Many , many people across the nation are [ leaning ] into our shared humanity and working hard to be creative about how they remain connected , \u201d says Lisa Marsh Ryerson , president of the AARP Foundation , the charitable arm of the AARP , which has nearly 40 million members . \u201c As long as those circles of connection are inclusive of older adults , we \u2019 ll all benefit . \u201d\nEven before the pandemic , 1 in 4 older adults surveyed said they struggled with social isolation and 1 in 3 with loneliness , says Ms. Ryerson . Now that many seniors have become cut off from personal contact or lost work , isolation is a growing risk . It can bring on loneliness , and prolonged isolation has negative health effects \u2013 the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day , according to research .\n\u201c Vulnerable older people tend to be invisible in communities , or can be . At a time of social distancing , we need to be very wary they don \u2019 t become more invisible . \u201d\nIn California , Gov . Gavin Newsom , the first governor to direct people over 65 to stay home , is asking individuals to call or text five seniors or knock on a door \u2013 even while keeping a safe distance . He \u2019 s urging folks who want to help to call a hotline , 833-544-2374 , to ask about ways to reach out to seniors . The state is also partnering with AARP and a nonprofit phone line that connects people with social services , including meals .\nAARP recommends ways to boost your loved one \u2019 s morale , including letter writing and video calling , care packages with puzzles picturing the family , and virtual meals together .\nRoy Bateman , a retiree who lives alone in San Francisco , says he is not the type to ask for help . He was never very social before the virus , though he valued the couple of outings a week to meet friends for lunch or go to a Japanese conversation class . He used to walk a lot \u2013 up to 10 hours a week .\nNow he \u2019 s mostly on his computer , watching news and short videos because he can \u2019 t concentrate , or writing emails , while doing a little remote volunteer work . The former federal grants administrator is anxious about infection , and ventures out only very late at night . He lets his newspaper sit for a day , and without punctuating events in the week , Mr. Bateman is losing track of time \u2013 loosely measuring it by how many cans of vegetables are left in his kitchen .\nHis last grocery shopping trip was to Costco on March 13 and he needs to go soon . But if some unknown good Samaritan called him \u2013 as the governor suggests \u2013 he probably would say he doesn \u2019 t need anything , because that 's `` pretty much the case . '' And he \u2019 d rather pick out his own food . \u201c I \u2019 m not interested in getting homemade muffins , \u201d he says .\nStill , he appreciates the weekly call he gets from Openhouse , which serves LGBTQ seniors . \u201c It \u2019 s really nice . \u201d\nPastor D. Darrell Griffin , of Oakdale Covenant Church , an African American church on Chicago \u2019 s South Side , spends a lot of time calling seniors \u2013 phoning about 35 on a recent day . \u201c They were just so elated to hear my voice , elated that the church was thinking of them , \u201d he says .\nThe church also hosts a 6 a.m. telephone prayer line , which has been extended from five to six days a week because of the COVID-19 crisis . It \u2019 s designed to accommodate the lowest-tech parishioner . The connections are not good and the leader has to remind people to mute their phones . But it works , and more people are joining in .\nGlenna Ousley is one of the regulars . She said the pandemic has made her feel cut off , but not isolated . The prayer line has helped . \u201c It \u2019 s comforting , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s uplifting . It \u2019 s God affirming . It \u2019 s life affirming. \u201d She adds : \u201c We kind of feed off each other . We take comfort in knowing we \u2019 re not alone . \u201d\nAt the Oakdale church , seniors help each other . Richard Dobbey is 71 and head of the ushers , most of them elderly . He \u2019 s also involved in the church \u2019 s men \u2019 s group , and they \u2019 re checking in on the older seniors .\nHe is starting to look beyond the present crisis . \u201c Some of these things you \u2019 re doing now , these are things we should do all the time . \u201d\nMr. Dobbey recently helped organize a funeral dinner for a family . Parishioners cooked or picked up spaghetti , potato salad , green beans , three kinds of chicken , and \u201c four or five \u201d cakes , he said . They couldn \u2019 t go to the funeral , so they dropped the food off at the family \u2019 s house .\nThe head usher says he isn \u2019 t in good health and doesn \u2019 t go out much . But a few days ago , when the weather in Chicago turned warm , he walked to his driveway , sat in his car and rolled down the windows .\n\u201c I just wanted some air . I did that , and listened to music . My wife said , \u2018 What are you doing ? \u2019 It was good for me . I \u2019 m doing something for myself , \u201d he says .\nHelping themselves , and helping each other \u2013 that \u2019 s true for many seniors during this isolation .\nIn Los Angeles , Hugo and Elba Corzo used to love going out to see dancers from their native Guatemala , and to dance themselves .
