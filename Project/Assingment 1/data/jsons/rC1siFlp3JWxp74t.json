    "content": "A basic principle of democracy is that parties have to accept that their opponents are sometimes going to win . Fight the election hard , maybe even bitterly , but at the end of the day , politicians and parties need to accept that their opponents can and sometimes should be able to win elections and wield political power .\nIf we learned one thing about the Republican Party in 2018 , it \u2019 s that they don \u2019 t seem to believe this anymore .\nIn the wake of a midterm election where the Republicans lost 40 House seats , Republicans were willing to call perfectly legitimate election results into question simply because they didn \u2019 t like the outcome . President Trump spread wild conspiracy theories about \u201c forged \u201d ballots in the Florida Senate race and of undocumented immigrants voting en masse for Democrats in California House contests . We heard similar sentiments from establishment figures like Lindsey Graham , Paul Ryan , and Marco Rubio .\nSome state Republicans have even decided to nullify the results of this year \u2019 s elections . Last Friday , Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker signed a bill that seizes key powers from Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers , who defeated Walker in November . Michigan Republicans are currently weighing a similar bill , and both are following in the footsteps of North Carolina Republicans , who passed a power-stripping bill after a Democratic victory in the 2016 governor \u2019 s race .\nThese acts go well beyond the normal democratic give and take , where parties battle over the rules of elections at the margins . They violate basic democratic principles , revealing the modern GOP to be a threat to the American political system itself .\nToday \u2019 s Republicans aren \u2019 t ideologically opposed to democracy in the way that , say , fascists and Islamists are . It \u2019 s that they care more about power than they do about basic democratic principles and are willing to run roughshod over the latter if it helps them win the former . This Republican attitude is more democracy-indifferent than anti-democratic , reflecting a party so caught up in partisan combat that it can \u2019 t recognize the authoritarian road it \u2019 s traveling down .\nThe GOP \u2019 s authoritarian streak predates Trump but intersects with his autocratic political instincts . The president \u2019 s rhetoric about illegitimate elections is the kind of language that , in some countries , has caused political crises \u2014 where a leader who loses an election then refuses to admit defeat . But the institutionalized Republican Party is unwilling to check Trump and in fact backs his play , because he \u2019 s on their team against the Democrats .\nThe result is a mutually reinforcing cycle . Republicans \u2019 indifference to democracy allows Trump to behave in a wild and dangerous fashion ; in turn , Republicans defend Trump and further weaken the fundamentals of the democratic system .\nThis a recipe for a crisis , and 2018 showed us what the most likely flashpoint would be : a Trump defeat in the 2020 presidential election .\nAn astonishing number of Republicans attacked the legitimacy of the November election in the days and weeks afterward .\nTake Florida , where it initially appeared that Republicans had won both the Senate and governor races . As the count went on , it became clear that the election night consensus was premature , and Democrats Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum were narrowing the margins due to late-counted votes in liberal strongholds like Broward County . The closer the margins got , the more willing Republicans were to cry foul .\nFlorida Gov . Rick Scott , who was running for Senate , accused Nelson of \u201c clearly trying to commit voter fraud to win this election. \u201d Sen. Rubio accused \u201c Democrat lawyers \u201d of trying \u201c to change the results of the election. \u201d President Trump claimed Democrats were committing \u201c election theft. \u201d Even after the two races were eventually called in the GOP \u2019 s favor , some national Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Graham \u2014 continued to suggest that the Democratic gains in the state were somehow ill-gotten .\nIn California , where late-counted votes flipped every seat in traditionally Republican Orange County blue , Republicans continue to insist that something fishy happened . Trump was , of course , the bluntest : \u201c The Republicans don \u2019 t win , and that \u2019 s because of potentially illegal votes , \u201d he claimed without evidence in a mid-November Daily Caller interview .\nBut he wasn \u2019 t alone among leading Republicans . In late November , outgoing House Speaker Ryan claimed that \u201c there are a lot of races there we should have won , \u201d blaming the GOP defeats on allegedly \u201c bizarre \u201d voting and vote-counting procedures in the state .\nIn New Mexico \u2019 s Second Congressional District , Republican candidate Yvette Herrell went on Fox News in mid-November and claimed that there were \u201c over 100 documented complaints \u201d of dubious voting practices in her race . She provided no evidence to back her claim , and the state board of elections certified the race in the Democrat \u2019 s favor on November 27 . Nonetheless , Herrell has still not conceded ; in early December , representatives of her campaign went to a warehouse to look over ballots .\nThese acts , when all put together , aren \u2019 t just the typical sour grapes you hear from a party that lost an election . They show a willingness to call into question the very legitimacy of America \u2019 s electoral process .\n\u201c These shenanigans will almost certainly undermine trust in our electoral institutions , at least among Republicans , \u201d Steven Levitsky , a government professor at Harvard and co-author ( with Daniel Ziblatt ) of How Democracies Die , told me . \u201c When politicians and parties are unwilling to accept defeat , democracy is clearly imperiled . \u201d\nThe threat stems from a root cause identified by Levitsky and Ziblatt in their book : political polarization . In the contemporary United States , being a member of a political party is about more than just what policies you \u2019 d like to see implemented . It \u2019 s a core part of people \u2019 s identity , shaping everything from who they like to spend time with to their sense of self and place in the world . This makes Americans more likely to believe virtually anything that favors their partisan team .\nUnder these conditions , Republicans suggesting Democrats are stealing elections is profoundly dangerous . If Republican elites like Trump and Ryan say that Democrats have won using illegal votes or shady voting procedures , Republican voters will believe them \u2014 and will start believing that Democrats can never win elections legitimately .\n\u201c Elections are among the most fragile of our institutions , \u201d says Ziblatt , Levitsky \u2019 s co-author and Harvard colleague . \u201c It \u2019 s exactly here that the system can easily collapse upon itself , when people don \u2019 t accept [ election results ] as legitimate . \u201d\nWe first saw the kind of impact Trump \u2019 s rhetoric could have in 2016 , when the Republican candidate was commonly heard claiming the election would be \u201c rigged \u201d by \u201c millions \u201d of illegal votes cast in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s favor . A study in Political Research Quarterly found that Trump voters were considerably less likely to believe that the election would be fair prior to the elections \u2014 a gap they suggest is attributable , in part , to Trump \u2019 s rhetoric about election rigging . There was real fear that this would lead to Trump refusing to concede to Hillary Clinton in the event of a loss , and that he \u2019 d get backing from a considerable number of Republicans in doing so .\nTrump \u2019 s win obviated these concerns . The study found that , after the election , Republicans magically regained their faith in the fairness of American elections . This is consistent with what political scientists call a \u201c winner effect \u201d : Voters whose preferred candidate wins always see the election as more legitimate than those whose candidate lost .\nBut imagine if Trump loses to , say , Sen. Kamala Harris or Sen. Bernie Sanders . Republican voters would be primed to accept a Trump claim that the elections are illegitimate . This would precipitate a situation in which Republicans falsely allege fraud and refuse to accept a Democratic victory as legitimate .\nSuch a possibility represents , for political scientists , a crisis on the horizon .\nIn 2016 , amid the fears about Trump not accepting a Clinton victory , Cornell political scientist Tom Pepinsky looked at two recent examples of countries where major political parties and their supporters had concluded that elections were illegitimate : Thailand and Madagascar . In both cases , the failure of democratic political institutions to resolve a conflict over power led to the military stepping in to resolve the crisis . In Thailand \u2019 s case , that meant the military seizing power for itself .\nThere are huge differences between those two younger , poorer democracies and the United States . But when I recently spoke with Pepinsky about the GOP response to 2018 , he sounded worried that Trump and Republicans are acting in a way that resembles a political party in a weak democracy drifting toward authoritarianism .\n\u201c What I see that \u2019 s similar is that officials who are members of one political party are criticizing electoral procedures based on what they anticipate the outcomes to be , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s an example of something that \u2019 s very dangerous , that you can find in authoritarian contexts . \u201d\nAmerica has gotten through a legitimacy-threatening electoral event before : the Florida 2000 recount , which many Democrats still believe the Supreme Court stole from Al Gore . But in that case , both Gore and George W. Bush emphasized the importance of respecting the results ( at least publicly ) , working to repair the reputational damage to the system and protect its legitimacy .\nTrump , it seems , would not \u2014 nor , we learned in 2018 , would the rest of the Republican Party . It \u2019 s now conceivable that if a Democrat wins a close election in 2020 , Republicans as a party will simply refuse to accept the vote count .\n\u201c If [ Trump ] loses a close race , he \u2019 ll promote false claims of election fraud , and he \u2019 ll still be commander in chief for ten weeks , \u201d writes Seth Masket , a scholar of American politics at the University of Denver .\nThe historical record on what happens after this kind of rhetoric is not at all comforting .\nThis flirtation with crisis isn \u2019 t coming out of nowhere . It emerged out of a number of Republican actions in recent years aimed at unfairly tilting the electoral system in their favor .\nOver the past decade and a half , Republicans have shown disdain for procedural fairness and a willingness to put the pursuit of power over democratic principle . They have implemented measures that make it harder for racial minorities to vote , render votes from Democratic-leaning constituencies irrelevant , and even overturn the results of elections wholesale . There hasn \u2019 t been a systematic Republican plan to undermine democracy , but rather a series of decision points at which Republicans have made the wrong choice without any real backlash from inside the party .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t just about President Trump , \u201d says Ziblatt . \u201c There \u2019 s really an assault on electoral fairness , I would say , in Republican-governed states . And it \u2019 s really only in Republican-governed states where this has taken place . \u201d\nTake voter ID laws . In 2008 , four states had strict voter ID laws on the book ; by 2018 , 10 states had implemented such laws . All of them had Republican legislative majorities at the time of passage . While it \u2019 s not clear how large an effect voter ID laws have on turnout , it \u2019 s clear that black and Hispanic voters are the most affected .\nThe partisan intent is quite obvious , and at times openly stated . In 2012 , when Pennsylvania \u2019 s GOP legislature passed its voter ID law , the statehouse \u2019 s GOP leader Mike Turzai spoke openly about the effect on that year \u2019 s presidential election . \u201c Voter ID ... is gon na allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania , \u201d he bragged .\nThe spread of voter ID laws illustrates how Republicans have become so comfortable with undemocratic practices at the national level : What starts as legislation in a few GOP-controlled states quickly spreads across the country , becoming , in effect , a part of the party \u2019 s national policy agenda .\nTake voter purges , a tactic in which state governments go through the voter registration rolls and remove people who haven \u2019 t voted recently from the polls . Republicans have come up with strict ways to conduct these purges , which tend to remove voters from Democratic-leaning groups ( like young voters and Hispanics ) who don \u2019 t turn out every year .\nIn 2015 , Ohio passed a law that would set up an automated system for conducting purges , widely expected to routinely and disproportionately remove Democratic voters from the rolls . The Supreme Court upheld the law in a 5-4 partisan vote earlier this year ; afterwards , 12 Republican states began considering draft legislation that would implement similar systems .\nIn addition to making voting harder , Republicans have become willing to restructure the rules of the game such that Democrats \u2019 votes don \u2019 t matter nearly as much . Extreme gerrymandering is the most obvious such tactic .\nIn 2010 , Republican strategist Karl Rove wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal advocating a significant Republican push to gerrymander legislative districts after that year \u2019 s midterm elections . Rove \u2019 s idea manifested as Project REDMAP , a dark-money campaign to support Republican candidates for state legislature and then help them redraw House districts after the 2010 census .\nWe first saw the results of this years-long process in 2012 , when Republicans held the House despite President Obama winning reelection and more Americans voting for Democratic House candidates than Republican ones . But the consequences persist , making it significantly harder for Democrats to win office in places around the country .\nIn the 2018 election , Republicans won about 50 percent of the US House vote in North Carolina . That translated into 70 percent of House seats due to heavily gerrymandered districts . Wisconsin Democrats won every statewide election in 2018 but did not win majorities in either chamber of the state legislature . Once again , gerrymanders are to blame .\nNorth Carolina Rep. David Lewis , who chaired the state redistricting committee that put together a map so racially contorted that it was struck down in court in 2016 , openly professed the power politics behind extreme gerrymandering in a speech on the statehouse floor .\n\u201c I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats , \u201d he explained . \u201c So I drew this map in a way to help foster what I think is better for the country . \u201d\nDemocrats aren \u2019 t wholly innocent here . Maryland Democrats have also conducted an extreme partisan gerrymander , and New Jersey Democrats proposed a plan that could produce a pretty severe gerrymander in their favor earlier this year . But New Jersey Democrats backed off the plan after criticisms from by the state \u2019 s Democratic governor , the head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee , and national media like the New York Times Editorial Board . There was no such backlash from inside the party when state Republicans proposed any of their far more aggressive plans , illustrating the fundamental asymmetry between the two parties on the importance of democratic values .\nGerrymandering isn \u2019 t the only way modern Republicans have tried to nullify Democratic votes . Recent years have seen a more brazen tactic : passing laws that overturn the results of an election that Democrats won .\nIn 2016 , North Carolina voters elected a Democratic governor , Rory Cooper , seemingly breaking the Republican stranglehold on state government . But the state legislature convened a special session , passing a bill that would strip incoming Cooper of key powers \u2014 including , most notably , his ability to end Republican control over the state election supervision authorities .\nNorth Carolina Republicans got away with it . Once again , it \u2019 s proving a model . Wisconsin Republicans passed a similar bill targeting Governor-Elect Evers in early December , which Gov . Walker so recently signed .\nRepublicans were explicit about what they were up to in this case , too . During the debate over the bill , Wisconsin Speaker of the House Robin Vos warned Republicans that if they don \u2019 t pass the power grab , they \u201c are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in. \u201d That \u201c very liberal governor \u201d had of course just been voted in by the people of Wisconsin , presumably to enact the policies he had campaigned on .\nMichigan Republicans , meanwhile , are currently currently moving forward with a similar bill to hamstring incoming Democratic Gov.-elect Gretchen Witmer .\nAny one of these examples of state-level battles over electoral rules could , on its own , sound like an isolated incident . But when you take a step back and look at the history and spread of these tactics \u2014 voter ID laws , voter purges , gerrymandering , election nullification \u2014 it becomes clear that the national party is on board .\nWhen one Republican state legislature or elected official pushes the boundaries , others follow . When the Supreme Court \u2019 s conservative majority issues a ruling opening the door to electoral law changes that benefit Republicans at the expense of Democrats , Republican legislatures rush to follow suit . Some of the state-level laws , like voter ID and gerrymandering , are openly championed by national Republican leaders and conservative activists .\nThroughout it all , there has been no whiff of public criticism from the party \u2019 s national leadership or allies in the conservative media . That \u2019 s how you get a party that \u2019 s willing to indulge Donald Trump and his crisis-precipitating rhetoric about stolen elections .\nTo head off a looming 2020 crisis , Republican elites need to step back from the brink . Democrats calling out Trump \u2019 s penchant for making up fake charges of fraud won \u2019 t be enough to convince Republican voters that the election is legitimate . The power of partisanship is such that Republican voters will accept even nakedly false claims from their party if the other choice involves lining up with Democrats .\n\u201c It is essential , \u201d says Levitsky , \u201c that other GOP leaders speak out . \u201d\nThe 2018 Arizona Senate election offered an example of a Republican accepting a close defeat gracefully . On election night , the election between Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema seemed to be going in the Republican \u2019 s favor . But as in Florida and California , late-counted votes narrowed the total , eventually giving Sinema a slight edge .\nTrump , as usual , tried out his claim of vote rigging \u2014 tweeting that there were fake signatures on Arizona ballots and that it might be time to \u201c Call for a new Election \u201d ( spelling his ) .\nBut this time , key state Republicans didn \u2019 t go along with him . Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake , whose seat McSally and Sinema were contesting , tweeted that there was \u201c no evidence \u201d to support Trump \u2019 s claims . Republican Gov . Doug Ducey called for every vote to be counted . And most importantly , McSally herself conceded to Sinema immediately after nonpartisan election observers called the race in the Democrat \u2019 s favor .\nIt was an impressive display of unity on the part of leading Republicans ( the state Republican party was , as my colleague Dylan Scott notes , an exception ) . But the fact that this gracefulness is noteworthy at all is depressing : A loser accepting a legitimate defeat is the most basic of behaviors you should expect from a political party in a democratic system .\nWhat \u2019 s more , these Arizona Republicans don \u2019 t speak for the party overall . Flake is retiring , McSally has been defeated , and Ducey isn \u2019 t all that influential nationally . Arizona is the exception , and Trump is the rule .\nThe result is that the Republican commitments to norms that protect our democracy continue to disintegrate at an alarming pace .\n\u201c What we \u2019 ve learned a lot in the last couple of years about the nature of democracy is that democratic rules and norms depend on the ability of elites to agree and coordinate on those , \u201d says John Sides , a political scientist at George Washington University . \u201c It matters what choices leaders make , and what choices leaders can get away with . \u201d\nFor years now , Republicans have gotten away with undemocratic behaviors . The more they \u2019 ve been able to do it , the more brazen they \u2019 ve become \u2014 with Trump being the culmination of this evolution rather than some kind of outlier . We saw in 2018 just how far gone Trump \u2019 s Republican Party is : they are willing to baselessly allege fraud and conspiracy after elections they \u2019 ve lost . We should be worried about a dangerous , potentially crisis-inducing reprise in 2020 .",

While it\u2019s not clear how large an effect voter ID laws have on turnout, it\u2019s clear that black and Hispanic voters are the most affected.\n\nThe partisan intent is quite obvious, and at times openly stated. In 2012, when Pennsylvania\u2019s GOP legislature passed its voter ID law, the statehouse\u2019s GOP leader Mike Turzai spoke openly about the effect on that year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cVoter ID ... is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania,\u201d he bragged.\n\nThe spread of voter ID laws illustrates how Republicans have become so comfortable with undemocratic practices at the national level: What starts as legislation in a few GOP-controlled states quickly spreads across the country, becoming, in effect, a part of the party\u2019s national policy agenda.\n\nTake voter purges, a tactic in which state governments go through the voter registration rolls and remove people who haven\u2019t voted recently from the polls. Republicans have come up with strict ways to conduct these purges, which tend to remove voters from Democratic-leaning groups (like young voters and Hispanics) who don\u2019t turn out every year.\n\nIn 2015, Ohio passed a law that would set up an automated system for conducting purges, widely expected to routinely and disproportionately remove Democratic voters from the rolls. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a 5-4 partisan vote earlier this year; afterwards, 12 Republican states began considering draft legislation that would implement similar systems.\n\nIn addition to making voting harder, Republicans have become willing to restructure the rules of the game such that Democrats\u2019 votes don\u2019t matter nearly as much. Extreme gerrymandering is the most obvious such tactic.\n\nIn 2010, Republican strategist Karl Rove wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal advocating a significant Republican push to gerrymander legislative districts after that year\u2019s midterm elections. Rove\u2019s idea manifested as Project REDMAP, a dark-money campaign to support Republican candidates for state legislature and then help them redraw House districts after the 2010 census.\n\nWe first saw the results of this years-long process in 2012, when Republicans held the House despite President Obama winning reelection and more Americans voting for Democratic House candidates than Republican ones. But the consequences persist, making it significantly harder for Democrats to win office in places around the country.\n\nIn the 2018 election, Republicans won about 50 percent of the US House vote in North Carolina. That translated into 70 percent of House seats due to heavily gerrymandered districts. Wisconsin Democrats won every statewide election in 2018 but did not win majorities in either chamber of the state legislature. Once again, gerrymanders are to blame.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. David Lewis, who chaired the state redistricting committee that put together a map so racially contorted that it was struck down in court in 2016, openly professed the power politics behind extreme gerrymandering in a speech on the statehouse floor.\n\n\u201cI think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I drew this map in a way to help foster what I think is better for the country.\u201d\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t wholly innocent here. Maryland Democrats have also conducted an extreme partisan gerrymander, and New Jersey Democrats proposed a plan that could produce a pretty severe gerrymander in their favor earlier this year. But New Jersey Democrats backed off the plan after criticisms from by the state\u2019s Democratic governor, the head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and national media like the New York Times Editorial Board. There was no such backlash from inside the party when state Republicans proposed any of their far more aggressive plans, illustrating the fundamental asymmetry between the two parties on the importance of democratic values.\n\nGerrymandering isn\u2019t the only way modern Republicans have tried to nullify Democratic votes. Recent years have seen a more brazen tactic: passing laws that overturn the results of an election that Democrats won.\n\nIn 2016, North Carolina voters elected a Democratic governor, Rory Cooper, seemingly breaking the Republican stranglehold on state government. But the state legislature convened a special session, passing a bill that would strip incoming Cooper of key powers \u2014 including, most notably, his ability to end Republican control over the state election supervision authorities.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans got away with it. Once again, it\u2019s proving a model. Wisconsin Republicans passed a similar bill targeting Governor-Elect Evers in early December, which Gov. Walker so recently signed.\n\nRepublicans were explicit about what they were up to in this case, too. During the debate over the bill, Wisconsin Speaker of the House Robin Vos warned Republicans that if they don\u2019t pass the power grab, they \u201care going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in.\u201d That \u201cvery liberal governor\u201d had of course just been voted in by the people of Wisconsin, presumably to enact the policies he had campaigned on.\n\nMichigan Republicans, meanwhile, are currently currently moving forward with a similar bill to hamstring incoming Democratic Gov.-elect Gretchen Witmer.\n\nAny one of these examples of state-level battles over electoral rules could, on its own, sound like an isolated incident. But when you take a step back and look at the history and spread of these tactics \u2014 voter ID laws, voter purges, gerrymandering, election nullification \u2014 it becomes clear that the national party is on board.\n\nWhen one Republican state legislature or elected official pushes the boundaries, others follow. When the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority issues a ruling opening the door to electoral law changes that benefit Republicans at the expense of Democrats, Republican legislatures rush to follow suit. Some of the state-level laws, like voter ID and gerrymandering, are openly championed by national Republican leaders and conservative activists.\n\nThroughout it all, there has been no whiff of public criticism from the party\u2019s national leadership or allies in the conservative media. That\u2019s how you get a party that\u2019s willing to indulge Donald Trump and his crisis-precipitating rhetoric about stolen elections.\n\nThe twilight of the Republican elites\n\nTo head off a looming 2020 crisis, Republican elites need to step back from the brink. Democrats calling out Trump\u2019s penchant for making up fake charges of fraud won\u2019t be enough to convince Republican voters that the election is legitimate. The power of partisanship is such that Republican voters will accept even nakedly false claims from their party if the other choice involves lining up with Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt is essential,\u201d says Levitsky, \u201cthat other GOP leaders speak out.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 Arizona Senate election offered an example of a Republican accepting a close defeat gracefully. On election night, the election between Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema seemed to be going in the Republican\u2019s favor. But as in Florida and California, late-counted votes narrowed the total, eventually giving Sinema a slight edge.\n\nTrump, as usual, tried out his claim of vote rigging \u2014 tweeting that there were fake signatures on Arizona ballots and that it might be time to \u201cCall for a new Election\u201d (spelling his).\n\nBut this time, key state Republicans didn\u2019t go along with him. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, whose seat McSally and Sinema were contesting, tweeted that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to support Trump\u2019s claims. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey called for every vote to be counted. And most importantly, McSally herself conceded to Sinema immediately after nonpartisan election observers called the race in the Democrat\u2019s favor.\n\nIt was an impressive display of unity on the part of leading Republicans (the state Republican party was, as my colleague Dylan Scott notes, an exception). But the fact that this gracefulness is noteworthy at all is depressing: A loser accepting a legitimate defeat is the most basic of behaviors you should expect from a political party in a democratic system.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these Arizona Republicans don\u2019t speak for the party overall. Flake is retiring, McSally has been defeated, and Ducey isn\u2019t all that influential nationally. Arizona is the exception, and Trump is the rule.\n\nThe result is that the Republican commitments to norms that protect our democracy continue to disintegrate at an alarming pace.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last couple of years about the nature of democracy is that democratic rules and norms depend on the ability of elites to agree and coordinate on those,\u201d says John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University. \u201cIt matters what choices leaders make, and what choices leaders can get away with.\u201d\n\nFor years now, Republicans have gotten away with undemocratic behaviors. The more they\u2019ve been able to do it, the more brazen they\u2019ve become \u2014 with Trump being the culmination of this evolution rather than some kind of outlier. We saw in 2018 just how far gone Trump\u2019s Republican Party is: they are willing to baselessly allege fraud and conspiracy after elections they\u2019ve lost. We should be worried about a dangerous, potentially crisis-inducing reprise in 2020.",
