    "content": "Overall reported crime was down in the first half of last year , according to new federal data from more than 270 cities that show declines in all categories except rape .\nThe overall decline follows a national trend that is 10 years in the making , says Tod Burke , a criminologist at Radford University in Radford , Va. \u201c The trend is downward . This is all good news , \u201d he says .\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reported Tuesday that homicides dropped nearly 7 percent in the first half of 2013 , compared with the same period a year earlier . Violent crime fell 5 percent . The greatest drop in homicides , 14.5 percent , took place in the Northeast , but other regions also reported a falloff in homicide rates : the West ( 6.9 percent ) , South ( 5.4 percent ) and Midwest ( 4.3 percent ) .\nArson was the only category represented by a double-digit decrease last year at nearly 16 percent . Burglaries fell the second most , 8 percent . Robbery ( 1.8 percent ) and motor vehicle theft ( 3.2 percent ) fell the least .\nThere are multiple reasons why crime rates continue to fall . One is more effective policing techniques , which incorporate technology and data to target specific areas or individuals , and are much more effective in prevention efforts .\n\u201c It is no longer how many officers you have , it \u2019 s where you place them . You \u2019 re seeing a lot more creative policing than what was going on in the past , \u201d Professor Burke says .\nDigital and mobile technologies are also creating more awareness and connecting the public with law enforcement more immediately . Not only can the public serve as \u201c the eyes and ears of the police \u201d via the cameras they have on their devices , but they are able to send and receive alerts immediately , which can help preventing and solving crime . \u201c The community becomes an extension of the police , \u201d he says .\nOther factors include rising incarceration rates , which remove those most likely to commit crimes from the streets ; and urban removal efforts , which have improved blighted areas most likely to be havens for crime .\nThe FBI data are not a comprehensive representation of national crime trends , as only 272 cities report their statistics .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a snapshot and we should take it as just that , \u201d Burke says . Besides not including every city in the US , one disadvantage is that some municipalities may , intentionally or not , have different reporting methods for classifying certain crimes .\nIn releasing the data , the FBI announced it was the first time that the number of rapes was based on a new definition , which it said represents a clearer picture of sexual violence .\nStarting in 1927 , the FBI began collecting data on \u201c forcible rape , \u201d that is `` the carnal knowledge of a female , forcibly and against her will . '' In its latest crime report , the FBI has expanded its definition to include both genders of victim and perpetrator and a broader definition of what constitutes rape .\nThe difference in reporting is reflected in the numbers . Under the new definition , data show that rapes increased nearly nine percent in the first six months of 2013 , compared with the same time period the previous year . Under the old definition , the opposite was true : rape fell nearly 11 percent in 2013 .\nKatie Hanna , executive director of the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence in Cleveland , says that the former definition did not \u201c reflect the large number of victims we know , as advocates , are out there . \u201d\n\u201c By including the new definition , what it says is this is a public health issue we need to take seriously , '' Ms. Hanna says , adding that the number of rape victims is likely much greater , since a large percentage of victims choose not to report the crime .",
