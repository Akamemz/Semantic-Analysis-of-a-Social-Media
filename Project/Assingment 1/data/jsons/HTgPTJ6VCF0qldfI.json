DeMille award , these performers are playing to their base . They seem to willfully reject the fact that we just had a hard-fought election and their preferred candidate lost .\nMore fundamentally , whether it \u2019 s actors or singers or NFL quarterbacks , I think the country is growing weary of political diatribes being injected into entertainment events . They have every right to speak out , of course , but to do it before a mass audience tuning in for an awards show feels a little bit like hijacking the event .\nAnd , of course , if the president-elect responds , he \u2019 s depicted as a bully in liberal quarters . The banner headline in yesterday \u2019 s Huffington Post : \u201c TRUMP LASHES OUT AT MERYL : \u2018 HILLARY LOVER . \u2019 \u201d\nNow Streep was undeniably a Hillary Clinton supporter ; she introduced her at the Democratic convention . And she \u2019 s hardly some empty-headed teenage pop idol . So she began with a defense of Hollywood , saying it was composed of people from across the country , like her home state of New Jersey .\n\u201c There was one performance this year that stunned me , \u201d she said . \u201c It sank its hooks in my heart . Not because it was good . There was nothing good about it . But it was effective , and it did its job . It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth .\n\u201c It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter . Someone he outranked in privilege , power and the capacity to fight back . It kind of broke my heart when I saw it . I still can \u2019 t get it out of my head because it wasn \u2019 t in a movie . It was real life . \u201d\nStreep was referring , obviously , to the accusation that Trump mocked disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski , who has limited use of his arms , after Kovaleski said an article he wrote after 9/11 did not support the claim that thousands of Muslims had celebrated on New Jersey rooftops . Trump denied that he was making fun of the reporter \u2019 s disability as he did a jerking-around imitation of him ; it was not his finest hour .\nStreep revived the 2015 episode to paint a dark portrait of Trump : \u201c And this instinct to humiliate , when it \u2019 s modeled by someone in the public platform , by someone powerful , it filters down into everybody \u2019 s life , \u2019 cause it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing . \u201d\nTrump , not one to let such attacks pass , tweeted that Streep is \u201c one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood \u201d and \u201c a Hillary flunky who lost big. \u201d In a late-night phone call with a New York Times reporter , Trump said he wasn \u2019 t surprised at being chastised by \u201c liberal movie people , \u201d adding : \u201c I was never mocking anyone . I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story . \u201d\nStreep also had a message for the media : \u201c We need the principled press to hold power to account , to call him on the carpet for every outrage . \u201d\nNow I fully endorse the first part , about the press holding politicians accountable . The second part -- '' every outrage '' -- is obviously a partisan slam that assumes there will be endless outrages .\nI \u2019 d offer a brief reminder that Trump hasn \u2019 t even taken office yet .
