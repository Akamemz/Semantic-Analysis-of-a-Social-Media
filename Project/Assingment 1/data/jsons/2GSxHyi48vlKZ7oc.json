President Trump signaled to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , and Sen. David Perdue , R-Ga. , that he would sign the package \u2013 even without provisions for the border . The senators say the President indicated the disaster money was too important and had been stalled too long . States in the south and Midwest \u2013 stricken by hurricanes and flooding \u2013 could wait no longer .\nThat \u2019 s until Rep. Chip Roy , R-Texas , torpedoed everything Friday morning .\nThere are three ways the House and Senate can approve bills . They can conduct a standard roll call vote , where everyone either casts ballots as yea or nay . The House and Senate can hold a \u201c voice vote. \u201d That \u2019 s where everyone either hollers yea or nay . The loudest side is supposed to win .\nHowever , the lawmaker who is presiding always declares \u201c in the opinion of the chair , the ayes have it \u201d or \u201c the noes have it. \u201d But , if the losing side doesn \u2019 t like the outcome , they can always demand a recorded vote . Finally , there is \u201c unanimous consent. \u201d That \u2019 s where all 435 or 100 people must agree . All it takes is a solitary objection , even if everyone else wants to do something else . Lodging an objection stops everything .\nLONE GOP REP BLOCKS DISASTER AID BILL IN SURPRISE MOVE\nIt is said you can make the sun rise in the west if you obtain unanimous consent .\nThere were only three House members on the floor Friday when the House tried to advance the disaster aid measure by unanimous consent and sync up with the Senate . Rep. Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , presided over the session . Rep. Donna Shalala , D-Fla. , was on the floor to make the unanimous consent request . And then there was Roy .\nThose in favor of the measure outnumbered Roy two one .\nUnanimous consent is powerful - but hard to obtain . There \u2019 s only one reason Roy showed up Friday morning as the House attempted to approve the measure with a skeleton staff on hand . Passing the package by unanimous consent would mean the House and Senate were in alignment , having okayed the same package . The measure would then be ready for President Trump \u2019 s signature .\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , implored Democratic leaders to keep the House in session on Thursday to approve the disaster aid measure . But the House wasn \u2019 t going to budge until the Senate acted . Most House members jetted out of Washington midday Thursday for a week-and-a-half , starting the Memorial Day recess .\nIt was unclear until early Thursday afternoon as to the fate of the disaster package .

But the Senate was set to vote on a retooled plan once President Trump signaled he would sign the measure \u2013 even without the border provisions . Things came together very quickly in the Senate . But the House was long gone .\nOne may ask whether it would have been worthwhile to keep the House in session just to see if the Senate would act . Of course , there \u2019 s always grandstanding from lawmakers about such efforts . Lawmakers regularly trumpet why Congress should remain in session over a recess or a weekend to try to fix one issue or another . Those are often the same lawmakers who have a cab idling just outside the Capitol , ready to whisk them across the river to make a flight at Reagan National Airport .\nThe Memorial Day recess is particularly problematic for scheduling . Many members have big overseas work trips planned . A number of lawmakers are expected to go to Normandy , France in a few days for the 75th anniversary of D-Day . That \u2019 s to say nothing of lawmakers who are jetting back to their states and districts to participate in Memorial Day parades and visit cemeteries .\nTethering lawmakers to Washington for a day or two , without a clear idea that a consequential vote is coming presents a problem . Yes , the Senate approved the disaster bill just after the House abandoned Washington .
