After all , Democratic attempts to delay , interrupt , grandstand , and even \u201c Spartacus \u201d their way out of replacing former Justice Anthony Kennedy with a conservative jurist of President Trump \u2019 s choosing had thus far been unsuccessful , so why not pull out the old classic \u201c Anita Hill \u201d tactic ?

When she tried to scream , she said , he put his hand over her mouth . \u201d\nThe alleged incident left Ford so traumatized , apparently , that she neglected to go public or even file a police report for \u2026 wait for it ... 36 years .\nAnd it \u2019 s not like she didn \u2019 t have plenty of opportunities during those nearly four decades . Yet , Ford was silent with Kavanaugh clerked at the Supreme Court , silent when he was a White House attorney , and still silent after Kavanaugh became a U.S . Circuit Judge in 2006 - a process that required a lengthy and controversial Senate confirmation - and all the years thereafter , even as he weighed in on important cases regarding the environment , separation of powers , human rights , and criminal procedure , among others .\nNow , on the eve of Senate confirmation , Ford - a California clinical psychology college professor who just happens to be a registered Democrat - decides that justice MUST be served . It \u2019 s her \u201c civic responsibility , \u201d don \u2019 t you know .\n\u201c I thought he might inadvertently kill me , \u201d Ford told the Post . \u201c He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing . \u201d\nSounds serious , and it would be if it were true . But most people who almost get killed by criminals \u201c trying to attack \u201d them , you know , go to the police . But Ford , Ford actually told nobody until 2012 while in couples therapy with her husband of then-10-years . Even then , notes from the therapy say nothing of Kavanaugh \u2019 s name , only that she was , the Post reported , \u201c attacked by students \u2018 from an elitist boys \u2019 school \u2019 who went on to become \u2018 highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington . \u201d\nIn another therapy session in 2013 , Ford reportedly \u201c described a \u2018 rape attempt \u2019 in her late teens. \u201d Except , she was supposedly 15 at the time of the incident with Kavanaugh , hardly \u201c late teens. \u201d That may merely be shoddy wording , but it does underscore the ambiguity of trying to \u201c legislate \u201d an allegation that old and unsubstantiated .\nFord alleges that after she escaped and locked herself in a bathroom a \u201c drunk \u201d then-17-year old Kavanaugh and his classmate went \u201c down the stairs , hitting the walls. \u201d Then , after five or ten minutes , she exited the bathroom , walked through the living room , and out the door . She doesn \u2019 t recall how she made it home , but Ford didn \u2019 t tell her parents because she didn \u2019 t want to get in trouble for being at a party with alcohol .

Ford supposedly passed a polygraph test , so if those can be trusted we know at least she believes it . But what exactly ? An attempted rape ? A misplaced grope ? A clumsy , unwanted kiss ? A drunken make-out session that led to nothing ? All of it \u2019 s up in the air , and when you \u2019 re looking 36 years in the mirror , especially if you \u2019 re a liberal knowing you could score a much-needed goal for the # Resistance , it can pretty much become whatever you need it to be .\nAnd things only become more complicated when you enter the murky , controversial world of \u201c psychotherapy , \u201d where dreams and imagination can become reality , at least in one \u2019 s own mind .
