So as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered , the lab has drawn scrutiny .\nMatthew Pottinger , Trump 's deputy national security adviser , asked intelligence agencies in January to look into the idea of a Wuhan lab leak , The New York Times reported . But CIA officers did n't find any evidence .\nThere 's a reason for that , according to Jonna Mazet , an epidemiologist at the University of California , Davis , who has worked with and trained WIV researchers in the past .\n`` I know that we worked together to develop very stringent safety protocol , and it 's highly unlikely this was a lab accident , '' she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Here are four reasons why .\nReason 1 : The lab 's samples do n't match the new coronavirus\nThe WIV houses China 's only Biosafety-level-4 laboratory . Scientists study the most dangerous and infectious microbes known to humankind in these types of facilities . Some of the institute 's researchers , including virologist Shi Zhengli , have collected , sampled , and studied coronaviruses that circulate Chinese bats . In 2013 , Shi and her collaborators pinpointed the bat population most likely responsible for spreading SARS , in the Shitou Cave near Kunming .\nAfter her team sequenced the COVID-19 virus , Shi told Scientific American that she quickly checked her laboratory 's record from the past few years to check for accidents , especially during disposal . Then she cross-referenced the new coronavirus ' genome with the genetic information of other bat coronaviruses her team had collected . They did n't match .\n`` That really took a load off my mind , '' Shi said told Scientific American , adding , `` I had not slept a wink for days . ''\nMazet has met and worked with Shi through PREDICT , a pandemic early-warning program started by the US Agency for International Development . The program has trained staff and funded labs in 30 countries , including the WIV , but President Donald Trump shut down PREDICT last fall .\n`` I 've spoken to her recently , '' Mazet said of Shi . `` She is absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening . ''\nMazet added that Shi set up a secure , shared database into which PREDICT members could upload their work for public release .\nIn 2018 , US officials raised concerns about safety issues at WIV , according to diplomatic cables obtained by The Washington Post . But Mazet said Shi 's work in the lab and in the field was above reproach .\n`` In the field , they wear extreme personal protective equipment , including multiple layers of gloves , eye protection , full body suits , and masks , '' she said . ( She noted , however , that she has not personally visited the WIV and could n't speak to all the research done there . ) Samples collected from bats , Mazet added , get immediately split between some vials that contain chemicals that deactivate the virus , and other containers that leave the virus alive .\nA laboratory technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at `` Fire Eye '' laboratory in Wuhan in China 's Hubei province .

There , scientists wearing personal protective equipment ( PPE ) unload them into a freezer set to minus 80 degrees Celsius .\nWhen the samples are studied later , researchers only use the deactivated , non-infectious ones , Mazet said , adding that the vials with viable virus are locked down in a special area .\nReason 3 : The coronavirus is the latest in a long line of zoonotic disease outbreaks\nRather than a leak , the coronavirus is more likely the latest disease to have jumped from an animal host to humans , experts say .\nThis type of cross-species hop , called a spillover event , also led to outbreaks of Ebola and SARS .
