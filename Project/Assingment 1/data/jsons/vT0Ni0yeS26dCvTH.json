Hillary Clinton got the first invitation . President Barack Obama got an early ask too . But she wanted to make the season premiere of \u201c Saturday Night Live , \u201d and Obama passed too , opening up another opportunity for Biden to remind every Democratic operative paying attention that important voting blocs like him , a lot .\nThe Human Rights Campaign , meanwhile , jumped at the chance to rearrange its schedule to land Clinton , creating a breakfast event for her to speak and collect some loud \u201c Hillary ! Hillary ! \u201d chants .\nBut the comparisons were there for the taking -- and he kept offering them up .\nClinton delivered a forceful speech about the future of LGBT rights to a standing group of Human Rights Campaign board members and staff . Biden showed up eight hours later in a packed ballroom to remind the crowd that he \u2019 d been with them all along\u2014at least , longer than Clinton even if his own history in the Senate wasn \u2019 t always so pioneering on these issues .\nBiden detailed an LGBT agenda that put him way out ahead of Obama and the White House\u2014and placed him , conveniently , in a central role that boxed out much of Clinton \u2019 s call to action that morning .\nWhile Clinton said she supported the policy review underway at the Defense Department that might lead the military to allow transgender Americans to serve , Biden argued that he was the one who first spoke out about allowing the practice . He was the one , Biden said , who got Defense Secretary Ash Carter to agree to look into the issue .\nAnd while Clinton is eager to see the results of the review , Biden wouldn \u2019 t wait , saying instead that he was sure the administration needed to go forward with rewriting the policy .\nThe Human Rights Campaign \u2019 s major aim at this year \u2019 s dinner was whipping support for the Equality Act , which would override state laws that don \u2019 t include anti-LGBT discrimination provisions . \u201c As president , I will fight for it , \u201d Clinton said Saturday morning . Obama hasn \u2019 t taken a position . Biden endorsed it Saturday night .\nBiden also appears to have let slip a larger White House effort to reverse the dishonorable discharges of anyone who , through history , was kicked out of the military for being gay . That \u2019 s a move Clinton called for in her speech Saturday morning . Biden told them he and the president were already on it .\nAnd of course , he reminded the crowd that didn \u2019 t need reminding \u2014 HRC president Chad Griffin introduced him as \u201c someone who \u2019 s been known to be a little impatient when it comes to doing the right thing \u201d \u2014 that he was the one who leapfrogged Obama on endorsing gay marriage in 2012 and forcing the president \u2019 s hand . ( A sensitive enough issue for Clinton that Kate McKinnon 's `` could have been sooner '' dig about her late arrival on the issue was a lone cold note in her otherwise welcoming and warm `` Saturday Night Live '' appearance . )\n\u201c I made a point , \u201d Biden said , recalling his conversations in the West Wing with the people who were yelling at him . \u201c You guys are way out of step . The American people are already there . \u201d\nIf Biden runs , he \u2019 ll be counting on major support among the LGBT community , both in terms of votes and donors . Already , people connected with the vice president and with the Draft Biden effort have reached out to a number of LGBT donors , and he \u2019 d look to use the affection he generates within the community to energize a Democratic primary campaign and the larger progressive base that connects with their cause .\nTo hear Biden tell it , he \u2019 s been with the Human Rights Campaign for longer than the Human Rights Campaign has been around , this time pulling one of his less frequently used stories about his father to talk about a time when he was 17 years old\u2014this would have been 1959\u2014and he saw two men in business suits kiss each other goodbye on their way to work .\n\u201c Joey , they \u2019 re in love with each other . It \u2019 s that simple , \u201d Biden recalled his father telling him , then turning his attention to the 3,500 activists in black tie and their history of work : \u201c You left the Supreme Court no choice whatsoever but to recognize the simple proposition my father taught me 50 years ago . \u201d\nClinton in the morning talked about how the work of the Human Rights Campaign had helped get her thinking into the right place , and her promises for what she \u2019 d do in the White House .\n\u201c I want you to know that I get it , \u201d Clinton said , talking about a future beyond the relics of discrimination , like the Don \u2019 t Ask Don \u2019 t Tell policy that she condemned without acknowledging the sensitive history of her husband \u2019 s role in establishing that when he was president . \u201c I see the injustices and the dangers that you and your families still face , and I \u2019 m running for president to end them once and for all . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been fighting alongside you and others for equal rights \u2013 and I \u2019 m just getting warmed up , \u201d Clinton she added later .\nBiden talked about how the people in front of him had changed the country and created a foundation that couldn \u2019 t be undone , telling them , \u201c You did so much more than anything those of us in public life ever did . \u201d\nCaught in the middle was the Human Rights Campaign , a group that has much to celebrate from the Obama years and a president that Griffin repeatedly tried to whip up applause for as the \u201c most pro-equality president in the history of this nation , \u201d but who only generated a lukewarm response from the crowd .\nThe politics of the crowd weren \u2019 t hard to pin down\u2014a video montage ahead of Griffin \u2019 s speech documenting the history of LGBT rights finished by showing the work still to be done , cutting right from Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to Jeb Bush to Ted Cruz to Vladimir Putin to the president of Uganda .\nCruz and Mike Huckabee , who \u2019 ve rallied by the side of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis as she \u2019 s refused to certify same sex marriages , are \u201c whackadoo extremists , \u201d Griffin said , shaking his head and insisting that they had to make sure they and people like them never become president .\n`` The good news is we all have a say in what happens next November , '' Griffin said , prompting a woman at the dinner to shout , `` Run Joe Run !
