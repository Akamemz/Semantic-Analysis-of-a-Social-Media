But even some harsh critics of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy hold open the possibility that the president might find it easier to deal with the diminutive Asian tyrant than with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .\nAt a minimum , the Hanoi summit offers Trump a chance to shift a losing political narrative which dates back to the drubbing his party took in November \u2019 s midterm elections .\n\u201c A lot of positive things are going on , \u201d Trump insisted in a Friday White House news conference mostly devoted to his frustration that Congress had denied him on the border wall funding he \u2019 d long demanded . \u201c We \u2019 re working on a summit , \u201d he added , predicting that it \u201c will be a very successful one . \u201d\nIf so , the summit could be a step towards a historic diplomatic achievement that becomes central to his 2020 reelection pitch .
