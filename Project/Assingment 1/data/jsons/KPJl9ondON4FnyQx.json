Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 11 , 2016\nThat tweet sent shock waves through the political world yesterday . Democrats understood it to mean that the next four weeks are going to be an ugly mud-wrestling contest the likes of which this country has never seen . They donned their hazmat suits and ventured into the mire . The Republicans , on the other hand , understood that Donald Trump had just declared war on their party .\nIn a flurry of tweets , he characterized House speaker Paul Ryan as `` weak and ineffective '' and claimed he provided `` zero support . '' He then accused Sen. John McCain of being foul-mouthed and begging for his support in the past . And he said the GOP was harder to deal with than his Democratic rival declaring , \u201c Disloyal R \u2019 s are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary . They come at you from all sides . They don \u2019 t know how to win \u2014 I will teach them ! \u201d Trump was n't just unshackled , he had staged a prison break and was running screaming through the streets as his many millions of fans cheered him on .\nAll this evidently came as a surprise to the GOP establishment , which apparently assumed it could abandon all pretense of supporting its own presidential nominee with no repercussions . Apparently leading Republicans still do n't understand what is happening to their party . They seem to be under the impression that their only problem is a strange interloper by the name of Donald Trump , and they could n't be more wrong . Their problem is that they have a large and powerful faction of voters who despise them as much as they despise the Democrats .\nWhen President Obama was elected , the Republican base of the party , demoralized and defeated after the mess of the Bush administration , the Great Recession and the euphoria of the Obama campaign , quickly gathered its wits and reformed itself into a new entity they called the Tea Party . At first it simply existed to oppose President Obama 's agenda , the health care reforms in particular . Backed by big special interests and right-wing media , they became a force to reckon with and in 2010 , with the economy still mired in recession and people still feeling desperate , they helped the Republicans win back a congressional majority , along the way unseating some long-term Republican incumbents like Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah and Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina , both taken down by primary challenges from the Tea Party right . They marched into Washington with a mandate to confront the establishment .\nThe new insurrectionists also wanted to blow some things up just to show they could , which led to government shutdowns and `` hostage taking '' and sequestration . It proved they had power to gum up the works but it did n't result in taking back the White House in 2012 , even with Rep. Paul Ryan , every Republican 's dreamboat , on the ticket . That defeat did n't change their strategy one bit . In fact they redoubled their efforts to turn Washington into a combat zone and whatever small amount of comity was left fell completely apart .\nIn 2010 and 2012 , Tea Party candidates repeatedly won primaries against GOP incumbents or more qualified politicians , often leading to bad results in the general election . They tended to nominate extremists and fringe characters like Sharron Angle in Nevada and Richard Mourdock in Indiana who could n't win . To some extent the Tea Party base did n't care whether the GOP won the seat or not . They were happy to flex their muscles against the establishment and put all officeholders on notice that if they did n't toe the line , they could be next .\nThen came the earthquake of 2014 , when the Tea Party and talk radio joined together to help an obscure college professor named Dave Brat take down a very powerful member of Congress .

Eric Cantor of Virginia , the House majority leader , who had been touted just a couple of years earlier as one of the conservative Republican `` young guns , '' the future of the party . Pundits and analysts insisted at the time that the reasons were all local in nature and had nothing to do with broader trends . They were wrong . Brat won because of one issue : immigration , which was stimulating the right in a way they had n't seen since the early days of the Obamacare town halls . The primary defeat of Cantor showed the GOP leadership they had targets on their backs too .\nA year later , fellow Young Gun Paul Ryan reluctantly took the speakership after John Boehner sacrificed himself in order to get a budget agreement that would hold through the election .
