Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nA year ago , concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process , \u2588\u2588\u2588 argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates , for the Democratic Party , and for democracy . Two months later , Senator Bernie Sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race . Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice , hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies , and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money . Sanders \u2019 s clarion call for fundamental reform\u2014single-payer healthcare , tuition-free college , a $ 15-an-hour minimum wage , the breaking up of the big banks , ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes\u2014has inspired working people across the country . His bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters , and his foreign policy , which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change , speaks powerfully to war-weary citizens . Most important , Sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell Americans the truth about the challenges that confront us . He has summoned the people to a \u201c political revolution , \u201d arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of Wall Street bankers and billionaires . Ad Policy\nWe believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary\u2014and that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re endorsing Bernie Sanders for president . This magazine rarely makes endorsements in the Democratic primary ( we \u2019 ve done so only twice : for Jesse Jackson in 1988 , and for Barack Obama in 2008 ) . We do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many . Americans are waking up to this reality , and they are demanding change . This understanding animates both the Republican and Democratic primaries , though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions .\nAt the core of this crisis is inequality , both economic and political . The United States has become a plutocracy\u2014one in which , as Sanders puts it , \u201c we not only have massive wealth and income inequality , but a power structure which protects that inequality. \u201d America \u2019 s middle class has melted away , while the gap between rich and poor has reached Gilded Age extremes . The recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared . Indeed , in the United States it seems that nothing is shared these days\u2014not prosperity , nor security , nor even responsibility . While millions of Americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change , fossil-fuel companies promote climate skeptics so that they can continue to profit from the planet \u2019 s destruction . While Americans have tired of endless war , the military-industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country , damaged our reputation abroad , and created a perfect storm of Pentagon waste , fraud , and abuse . While Americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal-justice reform , African-American men , women , and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets , and mass incarceration continues largely unabated .\nAmericans are fed up and fighting back . Seen in isolation , the Fight for $ 15 , Black Lives Matter , the climate-justice movement , the immigrant-rights movement , the campaign for a financial-transactions tax , and the renewed push for single-payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes . Taken together , they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super-wealthy , while failing to meet the needs of the many . They share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money , where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy . Senator Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country .\nIn Bernie Sanders , these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion . In contrast to the right-wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division , the Vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic-socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity . We must turn to each other , not on each other , Sanders says , and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all . His campaign \u2019 s funding reflects this commitment , spurning the support of corporate super-PACS and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors . Thanks to his campaign \u2019 s integrity , Sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud , irresistible demand for systemic political change .\nFor over three decades , Bernie Sanders has defied the political odds , while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country \u2019 s increasingly downsized political map . As mayor of Burlington , he led the fight to keep the Lake Champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city \u2019 s downtown area , submitting balanced budgets all the while . In the US House of Representatives , he helped organize the Congressional Progressive Caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers . In the US Senate , he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses , wars of choice , the deregulation of banks , and bailouts for billionaires , and his effective chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Veterans \u2019 Affairs has earned bipartisan accolades .\nWhile we believe that Sanders would make a great president , we know his road to the White House remains steep . At press time , he is contesting for wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining ground on front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polls . His economic-populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters , but he has yet to marshal deep support among the African-American , Latino , and Asian-American voters who form core constituencies of the Democratic Party .\nThat said , his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition , and in Sanders , Democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk : a civil-rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice , women \u2019 s equality , and LGBT rights . And they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn : Challenged early in the campaign by Black Lives Matter activists , Sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account , reducing mass incarceration , and reforming discriminatory drug laws . Voters can trust Sanders because he doesn \u2019 t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo .\nVoters can trust Sanders because he doesn \u2019 t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo . Freed from these chains of special interest , he can take the bold measures that the country needs . Sanders alone proposes to break up the too-big-to-fail banks ; to invest in public education , from universal pre-K to tuition-free public college ; to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with Medicare for All reforms . He alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage . He alone stands ready to put Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure , and to confront climate change by making the United States a leader in renewable energy . His audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn \u2019 t widen debate ; rather , it narrows the range of possibility . While Sanders understands this , we fear that his chief rival for the Democratic nomination does not .\nHillary Clinton is a candidate who combines unmatched experience with intelligence , grit , and strength . She has responded to the populist temper of the times : questioning the sort of free-trade deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have championed ; calling for reforms on Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy ; courageously defending Planned Parenthood ; challenging the National Rifle Association ; and supporting trade unions . If nominated , she would be far more preferable to any of the extremists running for the GOP nomination ( and so would former Maryland governor Martin O \u2019 Malley ) . We understand that keeping the presidency out of the hands of right-wing Republicans is crucial , especially when the next president will reshape the Supreme Court . And there is no denying that if she were elected , Clinton would shatter the thickest glass ceiling and champion women \u2019 s rights in a way that no other president has .\nBut the limits of a Clinton presidency are clear . Her talk of seeking common ground with Republicans and making deals to \u201c get things done \u201d in Washington will not bring the change that is so desperately needed . Clinton has not ruled out raising the Social Security retirement age , and her plan falls short of increasing benefits for all . She rejects single-payer healthcare and refuses to consider breaking up the big banks . We also fear that she might accept a budgetary \u201c grand bargain \u201d with the Republicans that would lock in austerity for decades to come . Clinton is certainly seasoned , but her experience hasn \u2019 t prevented her from getting things wrong .\nOn foreign policy , Clinton is certainly seasoned , but her experience hasn \u2019 t prevented her from getting things wrong . Clinton now says that her 2002 vote to authorize George W. Bush \u2019 s invasion of Iraq was a mistake , but she apparently learned little from it . Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El-Gadhafi in Libya , leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base . She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al-Assad in Syria , an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war . She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no-fly zone . Her support for President Obama \u2019 s nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms . If elected , Clinton will be another \u201c war president \u201d at a time when America desperately needs peace .\nSanders \u2019 s approach is different and better . The senator hasn \u2019 t talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities , and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy . But what he has said ( and done ) inspires confidence . An opponent of the Iraq War from the start , he criticizes the notion of \u201c regime change \u201d and the presumption that America alone must police the world . He rejects a new Cold War with Russia . He supports the nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran , and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation . He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good-neighbor policy in the hemisphere . Sanders \u2019 s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home . He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession , and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change . And as a leader of the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership , he would undo the corporate-defined trade regime that has devastated America \u2019 s middle class . LIKE THIS ? HELP KEEP \u2588\u2588\u2588 INDEPENDENT DONATE NOW !\nCritics of Bernie Sanders dismiss him as an idealist ( he is ! ) on a quixotic crusade . Meanwhile , the corporate media has paid shamefully little attention to his campaign \u2019 s achievements , instead lavishing attention on the latest outrageous pronouncements by Donald Trump and the Republican candidates struggling to compete with him . Nonetheless , polls show that Sanders\u2014even as he still introduces himself to many voters\u2014is well poised to take on the eventual GOP nominee , frequently doing better than Clinton in these matchups . Moreover , in contrast to the modest audiences at Clinton \u2019 s campaign stops , the huge crowds at Sanders \u2019 s grassroots rallies indicate that he \u2019 ll be able to boost turnout in November .\nWhether his candidacy , and the inspired campaign it fuels , will spark a \u201c political revolution \u201d sufficient to win the Democratic nomination and the White House this year remains to be seen . We do know that his run has already created the space for a more powerful progressive movement and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible . This is a revolution that should live on , no matter who wins the nomination .\nBernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice . Theirs is an insurgency , a possibility , and a dream that we proudly endorse .",
