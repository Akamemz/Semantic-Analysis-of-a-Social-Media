Sharma thinks more AIs should be trained not just on the ups and downs of the last few years , but also on freak events like the Great Depression of the 1930s , the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987 , and the 2007-2008 financial crisis . \u201c A pandemic like this is a perfect trigger to build better machine-learning models , \u201d he says .\nEven so , you can \u2019 t prepare for everything . In general , if a machine-learning system doesn \u2019 t see what it \u2019 s expecting to see , then you will have problems , says David Excell , founder of Featurespace , a behavior analytics company that uses AI to detect credit card fraud . Perhaps surprisingly , Featurespace has not seen its AI hit too badly . People are still buying things on Amazon and subscribing to Netflix the way they were before , but they are not buying big-ticket items or spending in new places , which are the behaviors that can raise suspicions . \u201c People \u2019 s spending behavior is a contraction of their old habits , \u201d says Excell .\nThe firm \u2019 s engineers only had to step in to adjust for a surge in people buying garden equipment and power tools , says Excell . These are the kinds of mid-price anomalous purchases that fraud-detection algorithms might pick up on . \u201c I think there is certainly more oversight , \u201d says Excell . \u201c The world has changed , and the data has changed . \u201d\nLondon-based Phrasee is another AI company that is being hands-on .

But because natural-language generation can go very wrong , Phrasee always has humans check what goes into and comes out of its AI .\nWhen covid-19 hit , Phrasee realized that more sensitivity than usual might be required and started filtering out additional language . The company has banned specific phrases , such as \u201c going viral , \u201d and doesn \u2019 t allow language that refers to discouraged activities , such as \u201c party wear. \u201d It has even culled emojis that may be read as too happy or too alarming .

Every time a web page with ads loads , a super-fast auction takes place where automated bidders decide between themselves who gets to fill each ad box . The amount these algorithms decide to spend for an ad depends on a myriad of variables , but ultimately the decision is based on an estimate of how much you , the eyeballs on the page , are worth to them . There are lots of ways to predict customer behavior , including not only data about your past purchases but also the pigeonhole that ad companies have placed you in on the basis of your online activity .\nBut now one of the best predictors of whether someone who clicks an ad will buy your product is how long you say it will take to deliver it , says Cline .
