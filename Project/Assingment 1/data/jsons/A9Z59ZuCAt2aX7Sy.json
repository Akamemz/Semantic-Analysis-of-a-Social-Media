    "content": "Donald Trump is indeed serious about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act . And to show just how serious he is , on Tuesday he chose conservative Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services .\nRepresentative Price , a Republican doctor from Georgia , stridently opposes Obamacare . He has also put forward legislation to replace it in every Congress since the bill was passed in 2010 .\nIf putting Price in charge of HHS is like \u201c asking the fox to guard the hen house , \u201d as Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D ) of New York puts it , that \u2019 s fine with Republicans .\nAt last , under unified GOP control in Washington , Republicans have an opportunity to act on their vision of healthcare for America \u2013 a vision that greatly reduces the role of the federal government in health decisions .\n\u201c The Republican approach is designed to focus on the individual , the patient \u2013 not on a government program , \u201d says G. William Hoagland , senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center . \u201c It \u2019 s a very private-sector oriented approach to healthcare . \u201d\nIf the Senate confirms Price as secretary of HHS , he will oversee a $ 1 trillion budget , about 80,000 employees , and nearly a dozen divisions \u2013 from Medicare and Medicaid to the Food and Drug Administration .\nPrice firmly supports House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s effort to partly privatize Medicare , healthcare for seniors . He also wants to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding .\n`` There is much work to be done to ensure we have a health care system that works for patients , families , and doctors ; that leads the world in the cure and prevention of illness ; and that is based on sensible rules to protect the well-being of the country while embracing its innovative spirit , '' said Price in a statement about his appointment .\nAs an orthopedic surgeon with more than 20 years of experience and the chairman of the House Budget Committee since 2015 , he will bring a high level of practical knowledge \u2013 both medical and fiscal \u2013 to his new post in the executive branch .\n\u201c This is the absolute perfect choice , \u201d said Speaker Ryan in a statement .\nRepublicans are expected to attempt to repeal the ACA early next year , through a budgetary process that requires only a majority vote in both houses for approval . They used the same process in 2015 , gutting much of the law . President Obama vetoed it .\nBut the bigger challenge has always been to agree on a replacement . Republicans have circulated various proposals for replacing the ACA over the years , but they have not come to a consensus .\nIn the House , at least , they now seem to have generally settled on a series of points outlined in a document called \u201c A Better Way , \u201d which Price supports .\nIn the document , Republicans would keep popular provisions of the ACA , such as having pre-existing conditions covered and allowing young people to stay on their parents \u2019 insurance .\nBut they would drop the federal and state \u201c marketplace exchanges \u201d set up under the ACA . As individuals and families begin 2018 enrollment in the exchanges , many of them are facing skyrocketing premiums and far less choice among plans \u2013 though they do get federal subsidies to help bear the cost increases .\nThe Better Way outline would instead help people purchase insurance on the open market with the help of refundable tax credits . Price , Ryan , and President-elect Trump also all favor health insurance that is available across state lines . And they would provide greater incentives for people to put away pre-tax dollars in health savings accounts .\nFor those who are priced out of these policies , the House Republican plan calls for federally subsidized \u201c high-risk pools \u201d and for Medicaid ( healthcare for the poor ) to be devolved to the states in the form of block grants or based on a state \u2019 s population .\nHere , President-elect Trump \u2019 s other healthcare nominee , Seema Verma , would play a particularly important role . Ms. Verma was nominated Tuesday to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , a division of HHS .\nIncreasing the income threshold to qualify for Medicaid has been the ACA \u2019 s main tool to get more poor people health coverage . The Supreme Court made that expansion of Medicaid optional for states , and many red states have decided against Medicaid expansion .\nBut some went ahead , on their own terms . Verma worked with Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he was governor of Indiana to design a Medicaid expansion in keeping with his Republican principles . To some , her appointment signaled pragmatism .\n\u201c To me , the Verma announcement was reassuring . It \u2019 s not just \u2018 let \u2019 s throw a couple hundred thousand people off Medicaid rolls and let them fend for themselves , \u2019 \u201d says Daniel Derksen , director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona in Tucson .\nDr. Derksen , who once practiced medicine as a family physician , says that Medicaid expansion has greatly helped to cover more people and directly eased the bottom line of hospitals that treat uninsured patients \u2013 \u201c charity \u201d cases . States have been able to somewhat customize the expansion and that has helped it gain acceptance in some Republican states such as his own .\nHe says he appreciates the \u201c personal responsibility \u201d aspect of Indiana \u2019 s program , where residents have to contribute to the cost of their coverage . Those above a certain income level who fail to make their payments are dropped and not allowed back for six months .\nCritics \u2013 and not just Democrats \u2013 point to weaknesses in the Better Way plan . Medicaid grants to the states run the risk of failing as a safety net during times of recession , for instance . States are required to balance their budgets , yet the number of poor people who would need Medicaid increases during hard times .\nAlso , high-risk pools were tried before the ACA fully took effect , and didn \u2019 t work particularly well , says Derksen , who is a Republican . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to make insurance work when you \u2019 re only covering sick people , \u201d he says .\nHe also worries about insurers and Big Pharma having too much sway if the marketplace exchanges are eliminated . He prefers to see the exchanges modeled along the lines of Tricare , the military plan that goes out to bid among insurers .\nThen there 's the question of whether the GOP promise to retain the popular aspects of the ACA is doable without the various mandates to purchase or offer insurance , a point that Senator Schumer raises .\nSuch criticisms will make it far more difficult to replace the ACA than to repeal it .\nThat \u2019 s why House Republican majority leader Kevin McCarthy of California told reporters on Tuesday that the plan is to repeal first , then set a transition period in which the law would still be in effect while lawmakers would hash out a replacement .\nThe replacement would have to be bipartisan if it is to get past the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that \u2019 s now required for most legislation , Rep. McCarthy said . A slew of Democratic senators from red states who face reelection in 2018 may well feel pressure to compromise with the GOP on a replacement .\nAt the same time , not all Republicans in the Senate may agree with their House colleagues .\nBased on Democrat reactions on Tuesday , the bigger fight is likely to be over changes to Medicare \u2013 which Price sees as a cost-cutting priority for the next Congress .
