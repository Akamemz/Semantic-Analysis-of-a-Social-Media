Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who did not campaign in the state , scored three write-in votes , followed by a vote each for former South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came out ahead in the other two locations .\nOn the final day before the primary , meanwhile , Sen. Sanders emphasized to supporters that \u201c what happens here in New Hampshire is enormously important ... the whole country is not only looking at New Hampshire - in fact , the whole world is looking at New Hampshire . \u201d\nThe populist senator from Vermont who \u2019 s making his second straight White House run is in the driver \u2019 s seat \u2013 sitting atop the final public opinion polls , drawing large and energetic crowds in the closing days , and sporting arguably the largest grassroots get-out-the-vote operation in the Granite State .\nAfter getting out of Iowa \u2019 s caucuses with essentially a tie with 2020 nomination rival Buttigieg , expectations are high for Sanders in a state where he shares home-field advantage with fellow progressive standard-bearer Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts .\nAs he did in Iowa , Sanders is stressing to his supporters that \u201c if we have the highest voter turnout in New Hampshire primary history , I am confident that we are going to win here in New Hampshire and if we win here in New Hampshire , we 're going to set the pace to win Nevada and South Carolina and California . \u201d\nBut meeting expectations in a state where he crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago is crucial for Sanders .\nSanders closed out his bid in the first primary state with a massive rally and concert that drew over 7,500 to the University of New Hampshire at Durham - which was by far the largest crowd for any Democratic presidential candidate in New Hampshire this cycle .\nHe was joined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a bunch of other high profile surrogates .\n\u201c New Hampshire remains Bernie \u2019 s to lose . He dominated in 2016 and his coalition seems confident again . That said , if he doesn \u2019 t win , it \u2019 s a huge hit to the Sanders path , \u201d emphasized longtime Democratic strategist Sean Downey , a national adviser on Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2019 s now-defunct 2020 presidential bid and a veteran of numerous political campaigns in New Hampshire . \u2019\nTHE FINAL POLL POSITION IN NH AHEAD OF TUESDAY 'S PRIMARY\nSanders declared victory in Iowa \u2013 where the results dribbled in for days after a reporting debacle on caucus night \u2013 by pointing to his lead in the raw vote totals coming out of the caucus precinct sites .\nButtigieg -- the former South Bend , Indiana mayor -- also claimed victory , spotlighting his narrow edge in the percentage of state delegates won . And for Buttigieg \u2013 like Sanders \u2013 a strong finish in New Hampshire is vital for his hopes of capturing the nomination .\nButtigieg was also stressing the importance of the primary , telling supporters the eve of the primary that Tuesday will be a \u201c historic night that will set the course for the party and the rest of the world . We are lucky and unlucky enough to be in a point of history where it will be recorded what we did . \u201d\nThe 38-year old candidate \u2013 the youngest in the field \u2013 told supporters on the primary eve that Tuesday will be a `` historic night that will set the course for the party and the rest of the world . ''\nButtigieg closed in on Sanders in the polls in the days after the Iowa caucuses . But one of the two tracking polls suggested that the candidate saw his numbers drop over the weekend . That wasn \u2019 t reflected on the campaign trail , as Buttigieg drew more than 5,000 people to his events on Sunday .\nButtigieg has struggled to resonate with African American and Latino voters . And with the White House race moving next to Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 which have much more diverse electorates \u2013 a strong finish in New Hampshire is paramount for Buttigieg .\nPointing to the calendar ahead , Downey emphasized that \u201c Mayor Pete \u2019 s situation here is urgent given his real lack of traction in the south and out west . \u201d\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\nIllustrating the tension between the top two contenders , Buttigieg once again took aim at Sanders on Monday , saying that \u201c at a moment when our country is so divided we ca n't risk further polarizing the American people . That 's why I 'm very concerned about the suggestion that either you got to be for revolution , or you must be for the status quo because that vision of politics as all or nothing is a vision that most of us ca n't see where we fit in . \u201d\nSanders \u2013 who \u2019 s funding his massive campaign war chest through small-dollar grassroots donation \u2013 took jabs at Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 saying they \u201c have dozens and dozens of billionaires contributing to their campaigns . \u201d\nThe former vice president \u2019 s message on Monday night to his supporters : \u201c stick with me 24 hours and we \u2019 re going to be just fine . We \u2019 re going to win this nomination . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s said he \u2019 s not \u201c writing off \u201d New Hampshire\u2013 but it sure looks like he \u2019 s lowering expectations .\n\u201c I took a hit in Iowa and I \u2019 m probably going to take a hit here , \u201d Biden said in a striking moment at the top of Friday night \u2019 s prime-time Democratic presidential nomination debate .\nAsked the next day by Fox News if he was writing off the Granite State , the former vice president fired back , saying , \u201c I \u2019 m not writing off New Hampshire . I \u2019 m going to campaign like hell here in New Hampshire , as I \u2019 m going to do in Nevada , in South Carolina and beyond . Look , this is just getting going here . This is a marathon . \u201d\nFor Biden , however , at least a third-place finish here could be critical , if only to prevent an exodus of donors and the possible erosion of his so-called `` firewall '' of support in the looming South Carolina contest . With the race for first increasingly looking to be between Sanders and Buttigieg , Biden \u2019 s essentially battling with Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for a top-three ticket out of the Granite State .\nIt 's a stunning predicament for the candidate who was once the unrivaled front-runner for the nomination . He 's long made electability central to his campaign pitch . But University of New Hampshire pollster Andrew Smith highlighted that the final UNH tracking poll for CNN \u2013 conducted after Biden \u2019 s lackluster fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses , indicate that \u201c Bernie Sanders is seen as the most electable candidate \u201d to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November \u2019 s general election .\n\u201c If your candidacy is based on electability , once you don \u2019 t win elections , that electability argument dissipates very rapidly , \u201d Smith explained , \u201c If Biden does very poorly in New Hampshire , going forward those voters in Nevada and South Carolina are going to look at that electability argument in a very different light because to be electable , you need to win elections . \u201d\nWarren \u2013 once a co-frontrunner in the nomination race - is also under the spotlight . She faced a deluge of questions the past couple of days from reporters asking how crucial a strong finish in New Hampshire is to her White House bid\n\u201c I did n't start by doing polls a year ago , and I still do n't do polls , \u201d responded the senator , who famously avoids all talk of her position in the polls .\nWarren \u2013 who \u2019 s repeatedly avoided saying New Hampshire \u2019 s a \u201c must-win \u201d state , has emphasized that \u201c the way I see this is it \u2019 s going to be a long campaign\u2026we \u2019 ve built a campaign to go the distance . \u201d\nTalking to reporters on her campaign \u2019 s press bus on Monday , the candidate told reporters \u201c I 've been counted down and out for much of my life . \u201d\nBut she emphasized that \u201c you get knocked down , you get back up . And you keep fighting because it 's not about me , it 's about the people who are counting on me . \u201d\nDowney noted that \u201c with a full field , the difference between third and fourth could be a few points and I \u2019 d look to strong organizing game and surrogate operations from Warren and Biden to make things interesting . \u201d\nBut thanks to a last-minute surge , add Klobuchar to the mix in the fight for third place .\nKlobuchar touted on Monday that \u201c as you probably heard we \u2019 re on a bit of a surge . I woke up this morning to find out that we are third in two polls . \u201d\nOne of the two final surveys \u2013 a Suffolk University tracking poll for the Boston Globe and WBZ \u2013 suggested that Klobuchar soared nine percentage points over the past two days .\nBut the big question is whether Klobuchar can capitalize on her late tide of momentum .\nSmith cautioned that \u201c I don \u2019 t think though that Klobuchar \u2019 s going to have the organization necessary to take advantage of her debate performance and her performance in Iowa and get those people out to vote .
