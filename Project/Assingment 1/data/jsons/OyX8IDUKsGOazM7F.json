    "content": "A federal appeals court rejected President Donald Trump \u2019 s request to reinstate his executive order on immigration , ruling Thursday that the president 's temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries \u201c drips with religious intolerance , animus and discrimination . \u201d\nThe sharply worded ruling from the Fourth U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond , Va. , is one in a series of legal setbacks for the White House and sets the stage for the Supreme Court to resolve the matter .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said late Thursday the administration plans to appeal to the high court . The president has said his order is necessary to help fight terrorism .\nIf the high court chooses to intervene , the case would mark a highly unusual test of presidential power less than a year into the new administration .\nThe case was considered by the full Fourth Circuit , with 13 judges participating . Ten of those judges ruled against the president , and three dissented .\nThe White House could try to seek emergency intervention from the Supreme Court in hopes of getting the justices to reinstate the travel restrictions quickly while the case continues . Such a request could provide an early indication of what the court thinks of the case , but the administration would have to meet a high legal burden to get such emergency relief .\nAlternatively , the administration could petition the Supreme Court through the normal legal process , but the justices aren \u2019 t scheduled to hear oral arguments again until October unless the court agrees to make special accommodations .\nNeither the White House nor the Justice Department indicated Thursday how quickly the administration plans to move in seeking high court intervention .\nThe Fourth Circuit ruling affirmed a Maryland judge \u2019 s decision in March that blocked the president from implementing a 90-day ban on travel for people from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .\nMr. Trump said the restrictions , signed March 6 , were needed to protect the country from terrorist threats while U.S. officials reviewed vetting procedures for travelers from those countries .\n\u201c These clearly are very dangerous times , and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence , \u201d White House spokesman Michael Short said after Thursday \u2019 s ruling .\nMr. Short said the administration is confident that the order is \u201c fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld . \u201d\nChallengers to the executive order alleged the GOP president was attempting to make good on his campaign statements supporting \u201c a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. \u201d And they said the temporary ban laid the groundwork for a longer ban down the line .\n\u201c The Constitution \u2019 s prohibition on actions disfavoring or condemning any religion is a fundamental protection for all of us , and we can all be glad that the court today rejected the government \u2019 s request to set that principle aside , \u201d said Omar Jadwat , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued the case on behalf of several individuals and organizations that opposed the president \u2019 s order .\nCourts evaluating Mr. Trump \u2019 s order have been grappling with how much weight , if any , to give statements he made before he was elected and since .\nWhen the president signed his initial , broader travel ban on Jan. 27\u2014which he later withdrew because of adverse court rulings\u2014he read the title of the executive order , Protection of the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States , and said , \u201c We all know what that means. \u201d That comment has been subject to different interpretations .\nRudy Giuliani , a former New York City mayor who has served as a surrogate for Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign , publicly said that the president had been looking for a legal way to effectuate his campaign promise to ban Muslims .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s public comments have been the central focus of the litigation . Even the president \u2019 s detractors concede his executive order would be on firmer legal ground without his earlier comments about Muslims .\nThe majority of Fourth Circuit judges concluded they couldn \u2019 t ignore Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments and those of his associates when evaluating the White House policy . Such statements suggest the purpose of the executive order \u201c is to effectuate the promised Muslim ban , \u201d Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote .\nThe president has broad power to deny people entry to the U.S. \u201c but that power is not absolute .
