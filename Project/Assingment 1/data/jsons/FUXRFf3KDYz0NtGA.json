    "content": "White House Press Secretary stepped in it this week . During Tuesday \u2019 s briefing , he said this when answering a question related to the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed at least 80 people , including women and children , and the massive missile attack that occurred in response to that heinous assault . He made a reference to Adolf Hitler , saying that he didn \u2019 t stoop as low as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and gas his own people . It was wrong . It was stupid . and it was a total trainwreck since Zyklon B was used to gas victims of the Nazi Holocaust . [ emphasis mine ] :\nQ : Thanks a lot , Sean . The alliance between Russia and Syria is a strong one ; it goes back decades . President Putin has supplied personnel , he \u2019 s supplied military equipment to the Assad government . What makes you think that at this point he \u2019 s going to pull back in his support for President Assad and for the Syrian government right now ? MR. SPICER : I think a couple things . You look -- we did n't use chemical weapons in World War II . You had someone as despicable as Hitler who did n't even sink to using chemical weapons . So you have to , if you 're Russia , ask yourself is this a country that you and a regime that you want to align yourself with ? You have previously signed on to international agreements rightfully acknowledging that the use of chemical weapons should be out of bounds by every country . To not stand up to not only Assad , but your own word , should be troubling . [ \u2026 ] Q : Sean , thanks . I just want to give you an opportunity to clarify something you said that seems to be gaining some traction right now . \u201c Hitler didn \u2019 t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons. \u201d What did you mean by that ? MR. SPICER : I think when you come to sarin gas , there was no -- he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing , I mean , there was clearly -- I understand your point , thank you . Q : I 'm just getting -- MR. SPICER : Thank you , I appreciate that . There was not -- he brought them into the Holocaust center , I understand that . But I \u2019 m saying in the way that Assad used them , where he went into towns , dropped them down to innocent -- into the middle of towns . It was brought -- so the use of it -- I appreciate the clarification there . That was not the intent .\nTwitter ripped Spicer a new one .

Yet , if we \u2019 re going to rake Spicer over the coals , I guess MSNBC \u2019 s Chris Matthews , who is also their resident Hitler scholar , is next since he also said that the infamous German dictator never used chemical weapons . This was back in August of 2013 , when Ghouta , Syria was subject to a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of people , some estimates soared over a thousand ( via RCP ) [ emphasis mine ] :\nCHRIS MATTHEWS : `` The problem is , I do n't like it , first of all I 'm rather dovish , I do n't like what I 'm going to say but it 's true .
