''\nCipollone continued : \u201c It would violate the sacred trust that the American people have placed in you and have placed in them . The American people decide elections . They have one coming up in nine months . \u201d\nSaturday was the first chance Trump \u2019 s lawyers had to refute the House \u2019 s case of impeachment and they came out making a forceful case that there are no grounds to remove Trump from office . Not only are Democrats asking the Senate to undo the results of the 2016 election but to tear up all ballots in the 2020 election with Trump \u2019 s name , Cipollone charged .\n\u201c They 're asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done and they 're asking you to do it with no evidence . And that 's wrong , \u201d Cipollone said .\nBilled as a teaser for next week 's argument , Trump 's legal team gave a 2-hour preview of their legal argument . All told , they 'll have three days and up to 24 hours to launch their defense - the same amount of time as House managers -- but Cipollone told senators up front they would be `` respectful '' of their time and make their presentations shorter and less repetitive than Democrats .\nWHO ARE THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS ? MEET PELOSI 'S HAND-PICKED PROSECUTORS\nHouse impeachment managers spent the prior three days arguing that Trump needs to be removed from office because he \u2019 s put his own self-interests before that of national security by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political opponent , former Vice President Joe Biden , and withholding nearly $ 400 million in security assistance to a country at war with Russia .\nIn smoothly choreographed presentations that relied on videos from witnesses and slideshows , the seven House Democrats drilled home the narrative that Trump needs to be impeached for abusing his oath of office by soliciting foreign election inference solely to boost his 2020 reelection chances . Trump , they charge , then obstructed Congress from investigating when he got caught .\nBut Trump 's legal team sought Saturday sought to dismantle the argument on several fronts . First , Trump could n't have pressured Ukraine because President Volodymyr Zelensky did n't know it was on hold until after his phone call with Trump , they said .\nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow said the president 's actions ca n't be viewed in a `` vacuum '' and reminded that Trump was `` subjected '' to the `` Crossfire Hurricane '' FBI probe before he was president and then Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's probe after he was in office . Trump had reason to not `` blindly trust '' the intelligence community and turned instead to his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters , he said .\nSekulow noted the administration has placed holds on aid to a number of countries , including Afghanistan , Lebanon , El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras . The U.S. withheld $ 300 million in military aid to Pakistan because it was n't meeting counter-terrorism obligation , he said .\n`` You did n't hear about any of that from my Democratic colleagues , the House managers , '' Sekulow charged .\nGOP SENATORS : DEMS THREW BIDENS 'UNDER THE BUS ' IN TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\nBut Sen. Debbie Stabenow , D-Mich , noted the big difference was Congress was notified and supportive in previous cases . She pointed to a GAO report that found the Trump administration broke the law by withholding the aid against Congress 's wishes .\n`` He did actually break the law , '' Stabenow told Fox News . `` And so I 'm going to be interested in hearing how the White House responds to the fact , that in this particular case ... Congress was not informed and not involved , which is the process they 're supposed to take . ''\nSCHIFF REFERS TO CBS 'HEAD ON PIKE ' STORY , INFURIATING GOP : 'EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS IT IS NOT TRUE '\nTrump 's legal team went on offense by targeting the lead impeachment manager , Rep. Adam Schiff -- first showing the Intelligence Committee chairman reading the essence of Trump 's July 25 phone call with Zelensky -- and ripping Schiff 's rendition as `` a fake . '' They also showed contradictory videos of Schiff 's comments about first wanting to hear from the whistleblower and then changing course over security concerns for the person who blew open the Ukraine case .\n`` Adam Schiff got kneecapped , '' Sen. Rick Scott , R-Fla , told Fox News after the opening statements .\nBut Schiff called any allegations he colluded with the whistleblower `` nonsense . ''\n\u201c I don \u2019 t even know who the whistleblower is , \u201d Schiff , D-Calif. , said Saturday at a press conference .\nThe fifth full day of impeachment trial proceedings began around 9:50 a.m. with a procession of the House managers and their aides wheeling the 28,578-page trial record to the Secretary of the Senate . The binders and files transported in carts will serve as the permanent historical record of the evidence against Trump . Democrats believe the record should have been thousands of pages longer if the White House hadn \u2019 t thwarted their attempts to get documents related to dealings with Ukraine .\nHouse managers , led by Schiff , have an upward climb of getting two-thirds of the Senate to convict Trump on the two articles of impeachment , especially when Democrats are in the minority with 47 seats and GOP senators have little political incentive to defy Trump , who remains extremely popular among his Republican base .\nInstead of winning them over , Schiff and Rep.
