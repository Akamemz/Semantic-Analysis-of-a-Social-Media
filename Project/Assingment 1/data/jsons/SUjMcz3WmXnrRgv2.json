    "content": "In August 2018 , New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy , a Democrat , vetoed a bill that would have imposed a five-cent fee on both paper and plastic carryout bags , arguing that the legislation did not do enough to protect the Garden State 's famed natural beauty .\n`` Single-use carryout bags\u2014particularly plastic bags\u2014represent a significant source of the litter that clutters our communities and mars New Jersey 's beautiful shoreline and parks , '' wrote Murphy in his veto statement . `` Instituting a five-cent fee on single-use bags that only applies to certain retailers does not go far enough . ''\nState legislators have clearly heard this message , floating proposals to ban not just plastic grocery bags , but all single-use bags\u2014paper or plastic .\nWorking its way though the legislature right now is S2776 . As written , the legislation would ban food service businesses and other retailers who have stores larger than 1,000 square feet from providing their customers with plastic bags . The bill would also naturally ban plastic straws .\nViolators would be fined anywhere from $ 500 to $ 5,000 depending on the number of offenses .\nThe bill passed one state Senate committee back in September 2018 but has been idling in the legislature ever since .\nThat was until late last week , when Sen. Bob Smith ( D\u2013Middlesex ) , one of the bill 's sponsors , announced his intention to amend S2776 to ban these same stores from handing out paper bags too . The idea , Smith says , came to him while on vacation in Aruba , where a similar bag ban is in effect .\n`` Nobody 's grumbling , '' the senator told NJ.com , saying that the Arubans have really taken to bringing their own reusable bags to the store . `` Everybody in the line , they all do it . ''\nNJ.com reports that Aruba has a ban on retailers handing out plastic bags , and imposes a roughly 28-cent fee on paper bags .\nAccording to Smith 's comments on his yet-to-be released amendment , his bag ban would be more radical still . `` No bags whatsoever \u2026 No single-use plastic , no paper , '' he said to NJ.com .\nSmith stands a good chance of getting his paper bag ban through . He claims to already have the support of Senate leadership . The state 's grocery store association is also on board with the policy .\nStill , one wonders what the practical effects of Smith 's amendment , as well as the wider plastic bag ban , will be .\nA recent study of plastic bag bans in California found that the policy\u2014while still reducing plastic bag consumption overall\u2014did lead to a 120 percent spike in the purchase of smaller garbage bags .\nAs it turns out , the single-use plastic bags people used at the grocery store were hardly single-use at all , but rather were reused to line waste baskets or clean up after pets . When the free option disappeared , people simply started purchasing unprohibited garbage bags .\nNew Jersey 's bag ban would seem to have a similar potential for this kind of substitution . While it bars stores from handing out thinner plastic bags , it still allows them to provide customers with plastic tote bags provided they 're thicker than 10 mils .\nAs written , stores could well end up ditching their current carry-out bags for another type of thicker plastic bag , which would seemingly increase overall plastic consumption .\nSmith 's amendment has yet to be released , so it 's possible that the thicker plastic bags will be stripped out of the bill as well . The senator 's stated goal is to get people bringing their own reusable tote bags to the store .\nWhen accounting for the emissions and energy required to produce them , things like cotton tote bags are far worse for the environment . That same study of California 's bag bans found that reusable cotton bags would have to be reused 131 times in order to have the same impact on the climate as single-use plastic bags .\nThat 's a long time for a tote bag to last .
