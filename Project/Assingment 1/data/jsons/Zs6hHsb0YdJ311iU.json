    "content": "The impact of the coronavirus-induced economic shutdown tore through the U.S. labor market in April at historic levels , slashing 20.5 million workers from nonfarm payrolls and sending the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7 % , the Labor Department reported Friday . Both numbers easily smashed post-World War II era records and help reflect the profound damage done through efforts used to combat the virus . Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting payrolls to shed 21.5 million and the unemployment rate to go to 16 % . April 's unemployment rate topped the post-war record 10.8 % but was short of the Great Depression high estimated at 24.9 % . The financial crisis peak was 10 % in October 2009 . The bleak numbers paint a `` pretty dismal picture , but April may be it for job losses going forward with the country starting to reopen , '' said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank . `` If there is a silver-lining in today 's dismal jobs report , it is in the realization that the economy can not possibly get any worse than it is right now . ''\nA more encompassing measure that includes those not looking for work as well as those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also hit an all-time high of 22.8 % . That reading may be a more accurate picture of the current jobs situation as millions of workers are being paid to stay home and thus not willing or able to look for new jobs . Its previous worst level was 17.2 % in April 2010 . The jump in the `` real '' unemployment rate reflected a plunge in the labor participation rate to 60.7 % , its lowest level since 1973 . Despite the stunning numbers , Wall Street was poised for another rally Friday , and government bond yields were higher as well . The April numbers represent a stark reversal for a jobs market that had been on fire only two months ago . February saw a payroll gain of 230,000 that was high for a recovery that lasted nearly 11 years . The month 's total was revised down 45,000 . March 's initially reported loss of 701,000 also was pulled down further , to 870,000 .",
