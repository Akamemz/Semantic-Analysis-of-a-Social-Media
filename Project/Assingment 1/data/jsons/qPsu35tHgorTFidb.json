On both points , Carney sought -- at length -- to explain why Biden 's remarks were being misinterpreted .\nIt marked a rather messy postscript to a performance that , if nothing else , fired up the base in a way President Obama did not at last week 's debate .\nMore On This ... White House moves to insulate Biden , Obama on Libya security question\n`` I thought he presented a remarkably strong case for the policies that this president has put in place , '' Carney said Friday , before launching into a string of explanations about the finer details .\nBiden 's comment on Libya drew widespread criticism from Republicans . Mitt Romney , at a campaign rally Friday afternoon in Virginia , asserted that Biden had `` directly contradicted '' State Department testimony .\nBiden , during Thursday 's debate , made the statement in response to criticism from Paul Ryan about the protection of diplomatic posts in Libya in the run-up to the Sept. 11 terror attack .\n`` Well , we were n't told they wanted more security there . We did not know they wanted more security again , '' Biden said .\nYet State Department officials just one day earlier had acknowledged they knew about , and turned down , requests for more security .\nCarney explained that Biden `` was n't talking about the administration writ large , '' just the White House . `` He was speaking directly for himself and for the president . He meant the White House , '' Carney said .\nThis opened up a new line of questioning on whether Obama and Biden were ever briefed on the security requests - though Carney declined to say . Rather , he made clear that decisions on personnel were handled below them , at the State Department level .\nBiden also drew the tsk-tsk of fact-checkers when he claimed that under Obama 's tax plan , `` The middle class will pay less and people making $ 1 million or more will begin to contribute slightly more . ''\nHowever , under the tax plan Obama has been promoting for years , the threshold for a tax hike would be considerably lower - individuals making $ 200,000 and households making $ 250,000 , or about 2 percent of taxpayers .\nAsked whether Biden had just indicated a shift in policy , Carney said , `` absolutely not . ''\n`` Our position on the Bush tax cuts has not changed , '' Carney said .\nHe said Biden was just using the $ 1 million threshold `` as an example . '' Carney defended Biden 's `` extreme command '' of the facts , though , pointing out that he also referred to other numbers that accurately reflected the president 's plan -- at another point in the debate , Biden did refer to `` 97 percent of the small businesses in America '' that make less than $ 250,000 .\n`` Why is that statistic important ? Because , as you know , that 's the $ 250,000 threshold , as he made clear , that 97 percent of American businesses do not have taxable income above $ 250,000 -- which goes right to the threshold the president has set since he ran for office back in 2007 , '' Carney said .\nLibya was n't the only foreign policy area where Biden left a few open questions . On Afghanistan he said , `` We are leaving in 2014 . Period . ''\nHowever , that seemed to indicate there would be no flexibility to leave some kind of U.S. presence in the country after that point . Asked once again to clarify , Carney said , `` It 's our policy to withdraw our forces by 2014 , '' but appeared to leave more wiggle room than Biden did .\n`` I think , as was the case with Iraq ... there are always conversations ... about future relations between our country and a country like Iraq or with Afghanistan , but in terms of the forces that are there now and the policy of this president , as was the case with Iraq , we are ending that war in 2014 , '' he said .\nBiden made several other statements that raised eyebrows with the Romney campaign , though the White House did not necessarily address them Friday .\nIn addition to his comment on the Libya security issue , the vice president went a step further Thursday and placed the blame squarely on the shoulder of the intelligence community for the faulty narrative , pushed for more than a week by the administration , that the attack was a protest spun out of control .\n`` That was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community , '' Biden said .\nIn response , former CIA chief Michael Hayden and former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff -- now Romney advisers -- chided Biden .\n`` We were disappointed to see Vice President Biden blame the intelligence community for the inconsistent and shifting response of the Obama administration to the terrorist attacks in Benghazi , '' they said in a written statement . `` It is clear that any failure was not on the part of the intelligence community , but on the part of White House decision-makers who should have listened to , and acted on , available intelligence .
