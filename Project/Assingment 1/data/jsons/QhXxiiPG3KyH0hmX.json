Bernie Sanders stopped in Arkansas Tuesday for a Walmart shareholders meeting to push the retail giant to raise its minimum wage to $ 15 per hour . The meeting , which he was invited to speak as a proxy for a workers \u2019 group , allowed the Vermont senator to make national headlines and bolster his brand as a champion for American workers .\nAnd four candidates \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden , Sen. Cory Booker , South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , and former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2014 travelled to Atlanta Thursday for the DNC 's African American Leadership Council Summit and I Will Vote Gala .\nDemocrats see Georgia as a potential pickup in 2020 , an enthusiasm fueled largely by Democrat Stacey Abrams narrow defeat by Republican Brian Kemp in the governor \u2019 s race . The four White House hopefuls comments in Atlanta largely looked past Georgia \u2019 s primary and to the potential for Democrats in the general election .\n\u201c This is a blue state , \u201d Booker said of Georgia , which last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996 and where every statewide office is held by a Republican . \u201c What that means is we need to go back to organizing and build a 50-state party . \u201d\nIowa and New Hampshire have long played outsized roles in the presidential nomination contests because of their first-in-the-nation status .\nA strong-showing in either state can create momentum ; a poor performance \u2014 or even failure to meet polling expectations set going into the voting \u2014 can sink a campaign . As a result , candidates have poured disproportionate amounts of time and money into winning over voters in these states .\nThe dynamic can leave outsider voters , particularly those in late-voting primaries , feeling irrelevant .\n\u201c It is easy here to feel discounted and invisible , \u201d said Jessie Hubble , 35 , who attended Warren \u2019 s Elkhart event . She is considering voting for either Warren , Buttigieg or Biden . \u201c It \u2019 s really important for candidates to reach out , so people who need to hear their messages can feel close . \u201d\nMultiple factors appear to be pushing candidates to take a broader approach to their strategy early in the election cycle , said Karen Kedrowski , director for the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University .\nKedrowski noted that in two of the last three election cycles the nominee didn \u2019 t lock his or her nomination until deep into the nominating contests , a fact that could be pushing candidates to think earlier about the long game . Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 didn \u2019 t become the presumptive nominees until June . On the Republican side , Trump won enough delegates to secure the nomination in late May .\nBut perhaps an even more important factor is that California , the biggest and most delegate-rich state , has moved up its primary to March 3 \u2014 the Super Tuesday election day when 12 other states and voters living abroad will cast their ballot \u2014 from its early June date of recent election cycles .\nMissed convention : Biden faces stiff criticism from Democrats for skipping California convention\nThe top eight candidates in national polling already have made at least 41 campaign-related appearances in the state , excluding fundraisers .\nCalifornia , with about 40 million residents and three top 20 television markets , is a pricey state for candidates to compete in .
