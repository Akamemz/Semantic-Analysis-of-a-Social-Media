It removes the prospect of a bruising battle for big establishment donor cash and moderate , right of center , Republican primary voters between Romney , the 2012 nominee and Bush , heir to a dynastic political machine .\n`` I think it is hard to argue that today 's news did not help Gov . Bush , '' said Matt Moore , chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina , which holds one of the crucial early voting primaries next year .\nBush sent the Republican race into overdrive with his sudden announcement last month that he was actively exploring a run for president . Since then , he has been flying around the nation in an apparent bid to put up a formidable `` shock and awe '' early fundraising number to define the contest in his favor .\nThough Bush is seen as leading establishment Republicans , Romney 's decision could improve New Jersey Gov . Christie 's hopes of financing a long campaign .\n`` Today 's news certainly does re-open the fight for donors . I know many donors had been frozen in recent weeks , taking a 'wait and see ' approach , '' said Moore . `` There 's a finite amount of money that can be raised -- so every candidate benefits . ''\nKevin Madden , a one-time adviser to Romney who is now a CNN commentator , said his former boss 's decision opened up an early trial of strength between Christie and Bush .\n`` This becomes the first big test between those candidates , which one of them can quickly move to lock down those donors . It is a very successful , very large fundraising network . It 's going to be an important asset . ''\nSome party insiders also believe conservative candidates who can also straddle the line with the establishment could benefit from Romney 's departure .\nA top adviser to one potential Republican primary contender said in an interview that Romney 's exit likely helps both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , who both have strong conservative support but have also been warmly received by some establishment-minded donors .\n`` They 're acceptable to the establishment but they also have support within the various conservative bases \u2014 among economic conservatives , social conservatives and national security conservatives , '' the adviser said .\nRomney 's decision not to run does n't remove him from the 2016 calculus entirely \u2014 it sets him up to be a potential kingmaker in one of the most wide-open primary fields in recent memory .\nThough sources told CNN 's Dana Bash not to expect a Romney endorsement of another candidate in the near future , contenders will be clamoring for his blessing .\nA top Rubio aide said `` any leading candidate would '' want Romney 's support .\nJim Merrill , Romney 's top strategist in New Hampshire , said that his `` guess is [ Romney ] probably will '' endorse a candidate in the primary .\nRomney 's statement , however , made clear that he was not stepping aside in favor of Bush . In fact he appeared to take a veiled swipe at the 61-year-old former Florida governor .\n`` I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders , one who may not be as well known as I am today , one who has not yet taken their message across the country , one who is just getting started , may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee , '' Romney told his supporters .\nHe appeared to be implying that the GOP would be best served by a younger candidate taking on Clinton , who will be 69 at the time of the general election in November 2016 .\nRubio , 43 , quickly picked up on the idea of a generational shift , stressing repeatedly in a short statement praising Romney that he was close to the 2012 nominee .\n`` He certainly earned the right to consider running , so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead . ''\nWalker , 47 , also picked up the signals , thanking Romney in a tweet for `` opening the door for fresh leadership in America . ''\nRomney may also be making a point by sitting down for dinner on Friday night with Christie , 52 , in New York .\nHis exit will also shift the terrain more practically in the early states , where his former staffers can now join the campaign of their choice .\nMerrill said he 's been receiving calls from former Romney operatives in the state \u2014 and interested candidates \u2014 wondering what 's next , but he was n't yet leaning toward any candidate in particular .\n`` [ Romney 's ] not gon na be a candidate , so that means we are open for business , '' Merrill said .\nReverberations are also being felt in Iowa , where voters will get the 2016 ball rolling next year and where Romney lost by only a handful of votes to Rick Santorum on the way to the GOP nomination in 2012 .\nA Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll published Friday showed 57 percent of likely caucus goers had favorable feelings about Romney .
