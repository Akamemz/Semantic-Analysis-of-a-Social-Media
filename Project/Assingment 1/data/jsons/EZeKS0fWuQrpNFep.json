    "content": "Hobby Lobby has always contended that even though it wo n't provide employees with comprehensive contraceptive coverage , it really is a very nice place to work because it goes the extra mile for employees .

Allen started as a part-time cashier at Hobby Lobby in 2010 , and found out she was pregnant not too long after she started .
