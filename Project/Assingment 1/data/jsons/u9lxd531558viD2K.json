    "content": "This past weekend , protestors and activists , including students , clergy , and concerned citizens descended on Ferguson , Missouri , for a weekend of marches , protests , sit-ins , and civil disobedience billed Ferguson October . Yesterday as one activist , Patrisse Cullors-Brignac , an organizer with Black Lives Matter tweeted exultantly from the inside of a St. Louis County jail cell about having taken over a Wal-Mart , I waited to hear news of her safe release alongside rapper-activist Tef Poe , attorney and legal observer Justin Hansford , and Palestinian activist Bassem Masri , who handled live streaming for the Organization for Black Struggle .\nOf course , many on Twitter , could not understand why disturbing the peace in a private business should be acceptable . The point is \u2013 we are no longer standing for business as usual . Lest we forget , racial segregation of old happened in \u201c private \u201d businesses , too , in stores like Woolworth \u2019 s and Hecht \u2019 s . That John Crawford could not step into a Beaver Creek , Ohio Wal-Mart , wander aimlessly , as so many of us have done on a casual shopping trip , and reasonably expect to come out alive , suggests that time is out for business as usual .\nThis nation proclaims Black America backwards , sees us as stuck in the past , declares that our obsession with race \u2013not racism itself \u2013 is holding back progress . But really , Black people are the hands on our national clock , controlling the timing of America \u2019 s social progress . This time both hands are up , pointing straight to the sky . It is high noon in America . It is the deepest midnight in our hearts . But , \u201c from the darkness cometh the light , \u201d Lucy A. Delaney proclaimed in the title of her 1891 autobiography . Until those hands move , no longer held hostage by a state-issued weapon , nobody is going anywhere .\nBiblical platitudes don \u2019 t go far with this crowd , but I \u2019 m reminded of a verse : \u201c it is high time to awake out of sleep . ( Romans 13:11 ) \u201d\nIn college , some youth government leaders used this verse with the slogan , \u201c The Awakening . Don \u2019 t sleep. \u201d These days , young folks have remixed it , proclaiming \u201c stay woke. \u201d I am sitting with what it means that we have moved from \u201c Don \u2019 t Sleep to Stay Woke . \u201d\nFor we have awakened from a long , fitful slumber . Lulled there by our parents and grandparents , who marched in Selma , sat down in Greensboro , matriculated at Black colleges , and argued before the Supreme Court , they convinced us to adopt their freedom dreams , impressed them into our bodies , in every hug , in every $ 25 check pressed into a hand from a grandmother to a grandchild on his or her way to bigger and better , in every whispered prayer , in every indignity suffered silently but resolutely in the workplace .\nLangston Hughes famously asked , \u201c what happens to a dream deferred ?\nDoes it dry up like a raisin in the sun ?
