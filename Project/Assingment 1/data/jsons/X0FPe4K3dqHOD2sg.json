I 've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 , or 20 , or 30 years ago . ''\nAs Obama left office , more than half of Americans polled said they thought race relations between whites and blacks had gotten worse -- up even higher than after the Charleston church attack .\nDonald Trump announced his bid for the presidency with the slogan `` Make America Great Again . ''\nDonald Trump 's rhetoric on the campaign trail in 2016 seemed to bring those divisions out into the open . Trump received great support in perceived and outwardly racist language . From his call for a so-called Muslim ban , to denigrating Mexicans at his campaign announcement , Trump stirred America 's melting pot of diversity and haters emerged .\nIt was n't just race . Jews , Muslims , Latinos , gays , immigrants and other minority groups found themselves as targets of hate -- both online and in real life .\nWhen Trump declared he was going to Make America Great Again , racists heard a clarion call . White supremacists perceived the message as it was time to make America `` white '' again .\nTrump 's victory coincided with readership growth on white supremacist internet sites and language on message boards like 4chan and Reddit became increasingly vitriolic . A report from the Southern Poverty Law Center looking at hate groups in 2017 found there were more than 600 groups that adhere to some form of white supremacist ideology . Within that category , neo-Nazis saw the most growth over the past year , from 99 to 121 groups .\n`` Hail Trump ! Hail our people ! Hail victory ! '' Spencer yelled as supporters of the alt-right -- in reality just rebranded white nationalists -- raised their arms in a Nazi salute .\nLawyers for a man convicted of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction to kill Somali Muslim refugees the day after the election now argue that he should be given leniency as he was swept up in Trump 's rhetoric .\nThe truck of a black man was vandalized with swastikas , the n-word and `` wite pride '' graffiti in Michigan .\nThe ugly words from the campaign trail seemed to be echoed on the streets , in stores and even in schools . Day after day , stories of people becoming victims of hate incidents seemed to pop up . White schoolchildren telling classmates with darker skin to go back to Mexico . Swastikas spray-painted onto temples and cars in Jewish neighborhoods . Muslims wearing head coverings attacked on the streets . Videos of the incidents shared online and ricocheting around the world .\nEach incident sparked outrage in the mainstream , which helped recruiters for the hate movement . Parker was one of those recruiters , for the Klan and the National Socialist Movement . He found himself vulnerable when he left the Navy after 11 years ' service as a torpedo man on submarines and came home in a bad state to a crumbling marriage .\nWhen he reached out online , looking to fill a void , a Klansman got back to him within 15 minutes and started sowing the hate . Parker was hooked , eventually tattooing a swastika on his chest , a white power symbol on one leg and on the other , two SS lightning bolts , a reference to Hitler 's , elite paramilitary force is now common imagery for white supremacists .\nKen Parker shows the tattoos of a German Iron Cross , a Confederate flag and Nazi lightning bolts .\nAnd he would recruit too , saying the goal was to `` wake up the white race , let them know that we have a problem with minorities , Jewish people running everything . ''\n`` If me and another one of my white supremacist buddies were in the grocery store and we saw a Jewish person , ... we 'd start making fun of them , '' he explains . `` Like , oh , that hooked nose Jew over there , you know , probably looking for pennies , '' he said . `` Where you see a Muslim in the grocery store , we 'd start talking about , you know , the new Mohammed cartoon ... sometimes we thought about grabbing a pack of bacon and throwing it in her shopping cart and walking off . ''\nAs he spewed his insults , websites like Daily Stormer grew its readership ; the site is now visited more than 2.5 million times a month , according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb . YouTube channels and podcasts dedicated to white supremacy began growing exponentially , creating an easy way to spread racist and religious hatred propaganda .\nWe 're going to have a race war one day . Ken Parker , former Klansman and neo-Nazi , on the thinking of white supremacists\nAnti-Semitic fliers began showing up on campuses as an attempt to sway young minds . Banners were strung across roadways .\n`` For race and nation , '' one read . `` 'Diversity is a code word for White Genocide , '' another declared . `` Danger : Sanctuary City Ahead , '' read another . `` You will not replace us , end immigration now , '' another said .\nThe goal , as always , Parker explained , was to grow the numbers of people who felt the same as them .\n`` You ca n't go into a battle with like five people , '' he said . `` So that was the perspective they were looking at . We 're going to have a race war one day . And the more people on our side , the better . ''\nIf there was a war to be had , the preliminary battle seemed to be Charlottesville .\n`` I 'm not gon na lie , like there were all kinds of people that went to Charlottesville that knew there were going to be a bunch of conflicts and they were just chomping at the bit waiting to be able to defend themselves with , like , extremely excessive force , '' Parker said .\nAs he rode in a van to Charlottesville from Jacksonville , Florida , with `` all kind of white nationalists , Southern nationalists , Nazis whatever , '' he thought of George Lincoln Rockwell , the founder of the American Nazi Party . Rockwell had used a `` hate bus '' to harass Freedom Riders in the 1960s . Parker liked the similarities and dubbed his transport the `` race bus . ''\nGeorge Lincoln Rockwell , center , leader of the American Nazi Party , with followers and his `` hate bus '' in Alabama in 1961 .\n`` On paper , we were just going up there to , like , stand up for the white race and defend our heritage , keep the [ Confederate ] monuments from coming down , '' Parker says of those attending the Unite the Right rally . `` But honestly , I think everybody was just going to fight . ''\nCharlottesville followed numerous protests nationwide on campuses and in public parks where small groups held banners declaring white supremacy , sometimes in nominal support of keeping Confederate statues to honor American history .\nIn Charlottesville , the white supremacists ' long-held hatred of Jews and their perceived control of the levers of power , also came out into the open .\nNeo-Nazis and white supremacists march and chant at counter-protesters in Charlottesville .\nA group of white men carrying torches marched through town shouting `` Jews will not replace us . '' Some chanted Nazi slogans and carried Nazi flags .\nIt was the most overt display of anti-Semitism in years and chilled Jews in America , who had long felt safe in the United States even as they remembered the struggles and the mass murder of the Holocaust . There had been an increase in hateful rhetoric and anti-Semitic acts in Jewish neighborhoods tracked by the ADL , but this was hate in the open with a mass following .\nThe next day , counter protesters gathered to challenge the Unite the Right rally . Most were peaceful but there were violent clashes between the two sides , with Antifa extremists joining the opponents .\nA car was driven at a crowd of counter protesters , allegedly by a man fascinated with Nazism , killing Heather Heyer and injuring others .\nPeople are flung into the air as a car drives into a crowd demonstrating against the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville .\nHeyer 's death brought calls to end the violent hatred plaguing the country . But for some like Parker , the hate group recruiter , it brought joy . Someone who opposed their views had died .\n`` It was like jubilation with all the white nationalists when that happened , '' Parker said .\nHe eventually renounced white supremacism and his hateful views after meeting a Muslim filmmaker in Charlottesville . After they spent time together , Parker realized he did n't hate the woman . He now says he regrets his views and actions .\nThe delight over Charlottesville was magnified by President Trump 's contradictory responses to the event . When he said there was `` blame on both sides '' and `` fine people '' among the original protesters , white supremacists saw it as a nod he supported them .\nThose looking to spew hatred felt they were vindicated -- and continue to quote Trump 's words to this day .\nThe present administration has never gotten up and said , just stop hate . Millard Braunstein , whose mother 's grave was desecrated\nSome victims felt the lack of condemnation would leave hatred unchecked and raise the possibility of more violence .\n`` The present administration has never gotten up and said , just stop hate , '' Millard Braunstein , a 91-year-old resident of Cherry Hill , New Jersey , said . `` In Charlottesville the President said , there 's good people on both sides . Show me a good neo-Nazi and show me a good Ku Klux Klansmen . I mean , it just is n't there . ''\nBut even if America has not seen a repeat of a large white supremacist rally since , it 's arguable that no place is safe from hate .\nOne of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the US had a swastika burning after a rally this April in Draketown , Georgia .\nAn Indian engineer was gunned down in a bar in Olathe , Kansas , by a man who reportedly yelled `` Get out of my country . ''\nA 17-year-old in Virginia allegedly killed his girlfriend 's parents after the couple tried to get their daughter to stop dating him because of his suspected neo-Nazi views .\nMillard Braunstein was disgusted that his mother 's gravestone was desecrated in a Jewish cemetery .\nBraunstein , the 91-year-old in New Jersey , found his mother 's headstone was among about 100 gravesites desecrated in Philadelphia 's Mount Carmel Cemetery in February 2017 . Many were toppled and cracked .\n`` How could this happen in America today ? That was my first thought , '' Braunstein said .\nA headstone lies broken in two after vandalism at Mount Carmel Cemetery .\nFor Jews , the America they saw as a sanctuary , was in many cases gone . Anti-Semitic acts in 2017 were the second highest since the Anti-Defamation League began tracking it in 1979 .\nBarry Werber knew what it meant to have a refuge as a Jew .\n`` This was the land of milk and honey , '' he said . `` This was where everything would be right . ''\nSome of Werber 's cousins died in Nazi death camps . Those who survived were permanently scarred -- by numbers tattooed on their arms , and by worse .\nWerber tells the story of one cousin . `` He was used by the German scientists for experiments to find out if muscles will regrow once you cut them out of an arm . They had literally cut the muscles out of his arms to see if they would regrow , '' Werber recalls , beginning to choke up . `` And he had to live with that . Thank God I never had to go through that . ''\nBarry Werber , a survivor of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting , is fearful about the climate against Jews in America .\nWerber 's dose of hell would come unexpectedly , 73 years after the Holocaust and on American soil .\nHe went to temple to say the Mourner 's Kaddish for his mother , when a gunman walked in and shot his way through the building . Eleven of his fellow worshippers died in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history , according to the ADL .\nNeighbors rallied to say `` hate has no home here '' after the tragedy in Pittsburgh .\nHe buried so many friends in just one week . And always with a growing fear that rather than the `` Never Again '' refrain that followed the Holocaust , there will be an `` Again . '' He worries that people may become afraid to associate with Jews as they become frequent targets . It reminds him of the shtetls , the ghettos and little villages where Jews were clustered before the Nazis came for them .\n`` Can it happen again ? Unfortunately , it can if the wrongness continues to grow , and the allowance by any leadership allows it to grow , '' Werber says . `` There are always people out there willing to jump on bandwagons of hate and that 's exactly what it is . ''\nThe Pittsburgh shooter had been on Gab , a social media site favored by alt-right followers , that is a frequent source of hate imagery and language , especially towards Jews .\nMoments before the massacre , he published an anti-Semitic message , saying , `` I ca n't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered . Screw your optics , I 'm going in . '' According to an officer on the radio , the shooter told police , `` All these Jews need to die . ''\nAn hour before a shooter attempted to go inside this church it was packed with dozens of worshippers .\nThe doors of the First Baptist Church in Jeffersontown , Kentucky , are locked .\nPastor Nelson wishes it could be an open haven , like the temple in Pittsburgh or how Mother Emanuel had been in Charleston .\nBut since that black church was attacked , the doors have been closed at this house of worship that serves the largest and oldest black congregation in the area , surrounded by mostly white suburbs .\nLast month , parishioners were inside when a man approached , apparently intent on doing harm .\n`` Cameras capture him trying to get in and on the sanctuary door , '' Pastor Nelson says . `` He bangs on it and pulls on it and he backs up , put his hand on the gun . So whoever would 've opened it would have possibly have gotten shot and killed . ''\nUnable to get in , the man left . The locked doors may have saved some of Nelson 's flock , but they did not stop the hate .\nThe stranger went to a nearby supermarket . He walked through the sprawling aisles . He could have shot at many people , but he did n't . He chose two . They were black . Before he was captured , the shooter told a bystander , `` Whites do n't shoot whites . ''\nHis intention was clear . He sought to take the lives of black people . One of them was Vickie Jones , who was shopping for groceries for the evening when she was gunned down .\nKevin Gunn says the more racism is combated , the stronger it seems to return .\nHer nephew Kevin Gunn says he can not believe his aunt survived breast cancer only to die at the hands of hate .\n`` It hurts to think that there are people who are out there who just do n't like people because they 're different , whether it 's their skin color or race , gender , sexual orientation , '' he says .\nHe blames the rhetoric in politics and proliferation of hate online for the culture that seems to allow hate to thrive .\n`` We used to be able to meet people in the middle and agree to disagree , '' Gunn says .\nAntifa and counter protesters to a far-right rally argue in Washington in August 2018 .\nPastor Nelson also believes things are on a dangerous course . But he 's seen where we 've been , and as a black man living in the South there is little that surprises him anymore .\n`` I 'm not shocked or surprised by anything because of all that we 've gone through and continue to go through , '' he says . `` I 'm just always saddened that in 2018 and on the brink of 2019 it still has n't gotten any better . ''\nStill he tries to give a positive message to his parishioners .\n`` Although things and people will get worse , we do n't have to become worse with it . ''\nKevin Gunn says his aunt Vickie Jones was the heart of his family .\nGunn , who lost his aunt , ca n't think what worse even looks like .\n`` I think the more that we try to combat racism , it seems like it comes back two-fold now , '' Gunn says .\n`` It 's kind of like the Hydra , '' Gunn says , comparing racists to the multi-headed serpent of Greek mythology .\n`` You chop off one and then ... two more pop up in its place . ''\nParker , the now-repentant ex-Nazi , is getting his tattoos lasered off . As with America , the stain of hate may take a long time to disappear and eventually , hopefully , heal .",

Parker was hooked, eventually tattooing a swastika on his chest, a white power symbol on one leg and on the other, two SS lightning bolts, a reference to Hitler's, elite paramilitary force is now common imagery for white supremacists.\n\nKen Parker shows the tattoos of a German Iron Cross, a Confederate flag and Nazi lightning bolts.\n\nAnd he would recruit too, saying the goal was to \"wake up the white race, let them know that we have a problem with minorities, Jewish people running everything.\"\n\nHis hate spilled into real life.\n\n\"If me and another one of my white supremacist buddies were in the grocery store and we saw a Jewish person, ... we'd start making fun of them,\" he explains. \"Like, oh, that hooked nose Jew over there, you know, probably looking for pennies,\" he said. \"Where you see a Muslim in the grocery store, we'd start talking about, you know, the new Mohammed cartoon ... sometimes we thought about grabbing a pack of bacon and throwing it in her shopping cart and walking off.\"\n\nAs he spewed his insults, websites like Daily Stormer grew its readership; the site is now visited more than 2.5 million times a month, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb. YouTube channels and podcasts dedicated to white supremacy began growing exponentially, creating an easy way to spread racist and religious hatred propaganda.\n\nWe're going to have a race war one day. Ken Parker, former Klansman and neo-Nazi, on the thinking of white supremacists\n\nAnti-Semitic fliers began showing up on campuses as an attempt to sway young minds. Banners were strung across roadways.\n\n\"For race and nation,\" one read. \"'Diversity is a code word for White Genocide,\" another declared. \"Danger: Sanctuary City Ahead,\" read another. \"You will not replace us, end immigration now,\" another said.\n\nThe goal, as always, Parker explained, was to grow the numbers of people who felt the same as them.\n\n\"You can't go into a battle with like five people,\" he said. \"So that was the perspective they were looking at. We're going to have a race war one day. And the more people on our side, the better.\"\n\nLooking for a fight\n\nIf there was a war to be had, the preliminary battle seemed to be Charlottesville.\n\n\"I'm not gonna lie, like there were all kinds of people that went to Charlottesville that knew there were going to be a bunch of conflicts and they were just chomping at the bit waiting to be able to defend themselves with, like, extremely excessive force,\" Parker said.\n\nAs he rode in a van to Charlottesville from Jacksonville, Florida, with \"all kind of white nationalists, Southern nationalists, Nazis whatever,\" he thought of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. Rockwell had used a \"hate bus\" to harass Freedom Riders in the 1960s. Parker liked the similarities and dubbed his transport the \"race bus.\"\n\nGeorge Lincoln Rockwell, center, leader of the American Nazi Party, with followers and his \"hate bus\" in Alabama in 1961.\n\n\"On paper, we were just going up there to, like, stand up for the white race and defend our heritage, keep the [Confederate] monuments from coming down,\" Parker says of those attending the Unite the Right rally. \"But honestly, I think everybody was just going to fight.\"\n\nCharlottesville followed numerous protests nationwide on campuses and in public parks where small groups held banners declaring white supremacy, sometimes in nominal support of keeping Confederate statues to honor American history.\n\nIn Charlottesville, the white supremacists' long-held hatred of Jews and their perceived control of the levers of power, also came out into the open.\n\nNeo-Nazis and white supremacists march and chant at counter-protesters in Charlottesville.\n\nA group of white men carrying torches marched through town shouting \"Jews will not replace us.\" Some chanted Nazi slogans and carried Nazi flags.\n\nIt was the most overt display of anti-Semitism in years and chilled Jews in America, who had long felt safe in the United States even as they remembered the struggles and the mass murder of the Holocaust. There had been an increase in hateful rhetoric and anti-Semitic acts in Jewish neighborhoods tracked by the ADL , but this was hate in the open with a mass following.\n\nThe next day, counter protesters gathered to challenge the Unite the Right rally. Most were peaceful but there were violent clashes between the two sides, with Antifa extremists joining the opponents.\n\nA car was driven at a crowd of counter protesters, allegedly by a man fascinated with Nazism, killing Heather Heyer and injuring others.\n\nPeople are flung into the air as a car drives into a crowd demonstrating against the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nHeyer's death brought calls to end the violent hatred plaguing the country. But for some like Parker, the hate group recruiter, it brought joy. Someone who opposed their views had died.\n\nA poster at a memorial service for Heather Heyer.\n\n\"It was like jubilation with all the white nationalists when that happened,\" Parker said.\n\nHe eventually renounced white supremacism and his hateful views after meeting a Muslim filmmaker in Charlottesville. After they spent time together, Parker realized he didn't hate the woman. He now says he regrets his views and actions.\n\nThe delight over Charlottesville was magnified by President Trump's contradictory responses to the event. When he said there was \"blame on both sides\" and \"fine people\" among the original protesters , white supremacists saw it as a nod he supported them.\n\nThose looking to spew hatred felt they were vindicated -- and continue to quote Trump's words to this day.\n\nThe present administration has never gotten up and said, just stop hate. Millard Braunstein, whose mother's grave was desecrated\n\nSome victims felt the lack of condemnation would leave hatred unchecked and raise the possibility of more violence.\n\n\"The present administration has never gotten up and said, just stop hate,\" Millard Braunstein, a 91-year-old resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said. \"In Charlottesville the President said, there's good people on both sides. Show me a good neo-Nazi and show me a good Ku Klux Klansmen. I mean, it just isn't there.\"\n\nA race war did not break out after Charlottesville.\n\nBut even if America has not seen a repeat of a large white supremacist rally since, it's arguable that no place is safe from hate.\n\nOne of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the US had a swastika burning after a rally this April in Draketown, Georgia.\n\nAn Indian engineer was gunned down in a bar in Olathe, Kansas , by a man who reportedly yelled \"Get out of my country.\"\n\nA 17-year-old in Virginia allegedly killed his girlfriend's parents after the couple tried to get their daughter to stop dating him because of his suspected neo-Nazi views.\n\nEven the dead could not rest in peace.\n\nMillard Braunstein was disgusted that his mother's gravestone was desecrated in a Jewish cemetery.\n\nBraunstein, the 91-year-old in New Jersey, found his mother's headstone was among about 100 gravesites desecrated in Philadelphia's Mount Carmel Cemetery in February 2017. Many were toppled and cracked.\n\n\"How could this happen in America today? That was my first thought,\" Braunstein said.\n\nA headstone lies broken in two after vandalism at Mount Carmel Cemetery.\n\nFor Jews, the America they saw as a sanctuary, was in many cases gone. Anti-Semitic acts in 2017 were the second highest since the Anti-Defamation League began tracking it in 1979.\n\nBarry Werber knew what it meant to have a refuge as a Jew.\n\n\"This was the land of milk and honey,\" he said. \"This was where everything would be right.\"\n\nSome of Werber's cousins died in Nazi death camps. Those who survived were permanently scarred -- by numbers tattooed on their arms, and by worse.\n\nWerber tells the story of one cousin. \"He was used by the German scientists for experiments to find out if muscles will regrow once you cut them out of an arm. They had literally cut the muscles out of his arms to see if they would regrow,\" Werber recalls, beginning to choke up. \"And he had to live with that. Thank God I never had to go through that.\"\n\nBarry Werber, a survivor of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, is fearful about the climate against Jews in America.\n\nWerber's dose of hell would come unexpectedly, 73 years after the Holocaust and on American soil.\n\nHe went to temple to say the Mourner's Kaddish for his mother, when a gunman walked in and shot his way through the building. Eleven of his fellow worshippers died in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history, according to the ADL.\n\nNeighbors rallied to say \"hate has no home here\" after the tragedy in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe buried so many friends in just one week. And always with a growing fear that rather than the \"Never Again\" refrain that followed the Holocaust, there will be an \"Again.\" He worries that people may become afraid to associate with Jews as they become frequent targets. It reminds him of the shtetls, the ghettos and little villages where Jews were clustered before the Nazis came for them.\n\n\"Can it happen again? Unfortunately, it can if the wrongness continues to grow, and the allowance by any leadership allows it to grow,\" Werber says. \"There are always people out there willing to jump on bandwagons of hate and that's exactly what it is.\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh shooter had been on Gab, a social media site favored by alt-right followers, that is a frequent source of hate imagery and language, especially towards Jews.\n\nMoments before the massacre, he published an anti-Semitic message , saying, \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\" According to an officer on the radio, the shooter told police, \"All these Jews need to die.\"\n\nLocked out, but not locked up\n\nAn hour before a shooter attempted to go inside this church it was packed with dozens of worshippers.\n\nThe doors of the First Baptist Church in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, are locked.\n\nPastor Nelson wishes it could be an open haven, like the temple in Pittsburgh or how Mother Emanuel had been in Charleston.\n\nBut since that black church was attacked, the doors have been closed at this house of worship that serves the largest and oldest black congregation in the area, surrounded by mostly white suburbs.\n\nAnd the locked doors likely changed the church's history.\n\nLast month, parishioners were inside when a man approached , apparently intent on doing harm.\n\n\"Cameras capture him trying to get in and on the sanctuary door,\" Pastor Nelson says. \"He bangs on it and pulls on it and he backs up, put his hand on the gun. So whoever would've opened it would have possibly have gotten shot and killed.\"\n\nUnable to get in, the man left. The locked doors may have saved some of Nelson's flock, but they did not stop the hate.\n\nThe stranger went to a nearby supermarket. He walked through the sprawling aisles. He could have shot at many people, but he didn't. He chose two. They were black. Before he was captured, the shooter told a bystander, \"Whites don't shoot whites.\"\n\nHis intention was clear. He sought to take the lives of black people. One of them was Vickie Jones, who was shopping for groceries for the evening when she was gunned down.\n\nKevin Gunn says the more racism is combated, the stronger it seems to return.\n\nHer nephew Kevin Gunn says he cannot believe his aunt survived breast cancer only to die at the hands of hate.\n\n\"It hurts to think that there are people who are out there who just don't like people because they're different, whether it's their skin color or race, gender, sexual orientation,\" he says.\n\nHe blames the rhetoric in politics and proliferation of hate online for the culture that seems to allow hate to thrive.\n\n\"We used to be able to meet people in the middle and agree to disagree,\" Gunn says.\n\nAntifa and counter protesters to a far-right rally argue in Washington in August 2018.\n\nPastor Nelson also believes things are on a dangerous course. But he's seen where we've been, and as a black man living in the South there is little that surprises him anymore.\n\n\"I'm not shocked or surprised by anything because of all that we've gone through and continue to go through,\" he says. \"I'm just always saddened that in 2018 and on the brink of 2019 it still hasn't gotten any better.\"\n\nStill he tries to give a positive message to his parishioners.\n\n\"Although things and people will get worse, we don't have to become worse with it.\"\n\nKevin Gunn says his aunt Vickie Jones was the heart of his family.\n\nGunn, who lost his aunt, can't think what worse even looks like.\n\n\"I have to sleep at night,\" he says.\n\nBut he can't help but be fearful.\n\n\"I think the more that we try to combat racism, it seems like it comes back two-fold now,\" Gunn says.\n\n\"It's kind of like the Hydra,\" Gunn says, comparing racists to the multi-headed serpent of Greek mythology.\n\n\"You chop off one and then ... two more pop up in its place.\"\n\nParker, the now-repentant ex-Nazi, is getting his tattoos lasered off. As with America, the stain of hate may take a long time to disappear and eventually, hopefully, heal.",
