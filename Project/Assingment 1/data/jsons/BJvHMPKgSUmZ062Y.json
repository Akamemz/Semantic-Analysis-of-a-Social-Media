Nine of those applications had not yet been approved\u2014meaning they were not supposed to be made public . ( We made six of those public , after redacting their financial information , deeming that they were newsworthy . )\nOn Friday , Lois Lerner , the head of the division on tax-exempt organizations , apologized to Tea Party and other conservative groups because the IRS \u2019 Cincinnati office had unfairly targeted them . Tea Party groups had complained in early 2012 that they were being sent overly intrusive questionnaires in response to their applications .\nThat scrutiny appears to have gone beyond Tea Party groups to applicants saying they wanted to educate the public to \u201c make America a better place to live \u201d or that criticized how the country was being run , according to a draft audit cited by many outlets . The full audit , by the Treasury Department \u2019 s inspector general for tax administration , will reportedly be released this week . ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 was not contacted by the inspector general \u2019 s office . ) ( UPDATE May 14 : The audit has been released . )\nBefore the 2012 election , \u2588\u2588\u2588 devoted months to showing how dozens of social-welfare nonprofits had misled the IRS about their political activity on their applications and tax returns . Social-welfare nonprofits are allowed to spend money to influence elections , as long as their primary purpose is improving social welfare . Unlike super PACs and regular political action committees , they do not have to identify their donors .\nIn 2012 , nonprofits that didn \u2019 t have to report their donors poured an unprecedented $ 322 million into the election . Much of that money \u2014 84 percent \u2014 came from conservative groups .\nAs part of its reporting , \u2588\u2588\u2588 regularly requested applications from the IRS \u2019 s Cincinnati office , which is responsible for reviewing applications from nonprofits .\nSocial welfare nonprofits are not required to apply to the IRS to operate . Many politically active new conservative groups apply anyway . Getting IRS approval can help with donations and help insulate groups from further scrutiny . Many politically active new liberal nonprofits have not applied .\nApplications become public only after the IRS approves a group \u2019 s tax-exempt status .\nOn Nov. 15 , 2012 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 requested the applications of 67 nonprofits , all of which had spent money on the 2012 elections . ( Because no social welfare groups with Tea Party in their names spent money on the election , \u2588\u2588\u2588 did not at that point request their applications . We had requested the Tea Party applications earlier , after the groups first complained about being singled out by the IRS . In response , the IRS said it could find no record of the tax-exempt status of those groups \u2014 typically how it responds to requests for unapproved applications . )\nJust 13 days after \u2588\u2588\u2588 sent in its request , the IRS responded with the documents on 31 social welfare groups .\nOne of the applications the IRS released to \u2588\u2588\u2588 was from Crossroads GPS , the largest social-welfare nonprofit involved in the 2012 election . The group , started in part by GOP consultant Karl Rove , promised the IRS that any effort to influence elections would be \u201c limited. \u201d The group spent more than $ 70 million from anonymous donors in 2012 .\nApplications were sent to \u2588\u2588\u2588 from five other social welfare groups that had told the IRS that they wouldn \u2019 t spend money to sway elections . The other groups ended up spending more than $ 5 million related to the election , mainly to support Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney . Much of that money was spent by the Arizona group Americans for Responsible Leadership . The remaining four groups that told the IRS they wouldn \u2019 t engage in political spending were Freedom Path , Rightchange.com II , America Is Not Stupid and A Better America Now .\nThe IRS also sent \u2588\u2588\u2588 the applications of three small conservative groups that told the agency that they would spend some money on politics : Citizen Awareness Project , the YG Network and SecureAmericaNow.org .
