    "content": "Sometimes the truth or dishonesty of an assertion depends on definitions or on when you start counting . When it comes to unemployment , for instance , Mr. Romney counts from the month when Mr. Obama took office and inherited an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs at historic rates . Mr. Obama prefers to count from 2010 , when his policies arguably had started to take effect and the job picture had begun turning around , eschewing blame for the losses at the start of his term .\nBut one thing is clear : While they claim distance from typical Washington politics , both men have mastered the ancient Washington art of selective storytelling .\n\u201c Over 4 million jobs created in the last two years. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\nNowhere is the veracity of the candidates \u2019 statements more central than on the economic issues at the heart of their contest . The question of job creation provides a quintessential case study . By counting from January 2009 , Mr. Romney paints the bleak portrait of a country that despite a modest recovery still has fewer jobs than it did when Mr. Obama took office . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the country has 552,000 fewer jobs now than when the president was inaugurated .\nMr. Obama starts his count in March 2010 , after the money from his stimulus law was flowing and payrolls began growing again . And he generally cites private-sector employment , so that he can say 4.3 million jobs have been created . Counting government work forces , the job growth is actually lower , 3.8 million jobs , according to the bureau .\nIs it reasonable to start counting in January 2009 ? The economy was already shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month , and none of Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies would take effect for some time . Starting the count just one month later would show a small net increase in jobs for the president \u2019 s tenure in office . Yet if he can not be blamed for job losses in the early months of his term , can Mr. Obama be held responsible for not replacing the lost jobs more quickly ?\nMr. Obama has \u201c added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Romney\nThe total national debt now stands at $ 15.8 trillion , up from $ 10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office , an increase of nearly 50 percent . A commonly cited and more economically important subset , debt held by the public , has grown to $ 11 trillion from $ 6.3 trillion , a 75 percent increase \u2014 closer to Mr. Romney \u2019 s claim , but still $ 1.7 trillion short of matching the accumulated public debt of the first 43 presidents . Adjusted for inflation , the debt Mr. Obama incurred is smaller relative to the combined prior debt .\n\u201c Since President Obama assumed office ... federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Romney\n\u201c Since I \u2019 ve been president , federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\nBoth men may be exaggerating in their own ways \u2014 and once again it depends in part on when you start counting . The president based his claim on a column in Market Watch , which calculated that government spending during the Obama years has grown 1.4 percent annually , the lowest since President Dwight D. Eisenhower .\nBut that column started counting with the fiscal year that started on Oct. 1 , 2009 , more than eight months after Mr. Obama took office , on the theory that that was the first full fiscal year Mr. Obama could shape . It held Mr. Obama responsible for $ 140 billion in additional spending from those first eight months stemming largely from his stimulus spending program . The calculation also gave Mr. Obama credit for automatic spending cuts scheduled for the next fiscal year , which the president opposes and which may not actually take effect .\nUsing different ways to calculate spending , The Washington Post found that spending has been going up 5.2 percent a year under Mr. Obama , while The Associated Press put the figure at 3 percent , excluding 2009 . Either way , it is neither the \u201c lowest pace in nearly 60 years , \u201d as Mr. Obama claimed , nor \u201c at a pace without precedent in recent history , \u201d as Mr. Romney charged .\nGoing back to Eisenhower , federal spending has risen on average 7 percent a year , or 2.6 percent when adjusted for inflation . After the spending burst of 2009 , Mr. Obama , constrained by Congress and aided by repayments of bank and auto bailouts , increased spending just 0.5 percent a year over the next three fiscal years when adjusted for inflation ; only two other three-year periods since Eisenhower had lower spending growth .\nAnother way to judge spending is to look at what was anticipated based on the laws and policies at the time Mr. Obama took office versus what actually happened . In January 2009 , days before he was inaugurated , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast spending in the 2011 fiscal year , which ended last Sept. 30 , at $ 3.323 trillion . In reality , after the policies put in place by Mr. Obama and Congress , it turned out to be $ 3.603 trillion , 8.4 percent higher .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .

Please try again later . View all New York Times newsletters .\nYet another way to look at spending is as a share of the overall economy . For years up to and through most of George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , federal spending generally totaled about 20 percent or less of the nation \u2019 s overall economic output . In Mr. Bush \u2019 s final full fiscal year in office , ending Sept. 30 , 2008 , it rose to 20.8 percent .\nThe next fiscal year , in which Mr. Bush was president for four months and Mr. Obama for eight , it shot up to 25.2 percent , then dipped to 24.1 percent for each of the next two years , the highest levels since World War II . Of course one reason spending is a larger share of the economy is because the overall economy shrunk during the recession . But even if spending rose starkly during the economic crisis under the presidencies of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama , it has remained at the higher level since then under Mr. Obama .\n\u201c The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\nAgain , it depends on how it is counted . Looking at the five months from Mr. Obama \u2019 s inauguration to June 2009 , when the recession officially ended , and including state and local governments , which are not under his direct control , government employment at all levels was virtually unchanged , from 22,576,000 in January 2009 to 22,570,000 in June , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nTotal government employment was 21,969,000 in May 2012 , a reduction of about 600,000 jobs . But looking only at the federal work force under Mr. Obama \u2019 s direct control , then government employment has actually gone up . He inherited a federal work force of 2,061,700 , and it rose slightly through June 2009 to 2,109,700 ; by May of this year , it had grown further to 2,204,100 , a 7 percent increase .\nMr. Obama is not correct in saying this was the \u201c only time \u201d government shrank during a recession . During the recession from July 1981 through November 1982 , under President Ronald Reagan , and again during the recession from July 1990 through March 1991 , under the elder President George Bush , government employment shrank slightly , both over all and in the federal work force specifically . The White House said he meant the recession and the 35 months after it .\nEither way , while Mr. Obama has boasted of shrinking the public work force , he has advocated policies to prevent it from shrinking by helping state and local governments avoid laying off employees . In recent days , he has lamented that continuing economic troubles result in part from a decreasing public work force .\n\u201c We are only inches away from no longer being a free economy. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Romney\nIn attacking Mr. Obama \u2019 s stewardship of the economy , Mr. Romney has engaged in hyperbole at times \u2014 as with this claim . He has also contended that Mr. Obama made the recession \u201c worse \u201d and \u201c last longer \u201d and said that the president \u2019 s health care law would increase government spending to nearly half of the American economy .\nThere is plenty of debate over how effective Mr. Obama \u2019 s economic policies have been , especially given the painfully slow recovery , but economists do not generally claim that Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies worsened the recession or made it longer .\nThe 18-month recession officially ended in June 2009 , five months into Mr. Obama \u2019 s term , as measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research . And even critics who consider the president \u2019 s stimulus package a missed opportunity \u2014 from liberals who say it was too small to conservatives who say it was wasteful and poorly targeted \u2014 tend to acknowledge what the Congressional Budget Office has found : it did save and create jobs , lower unemployment and help the economy grow in the short term .\nDespite Mr. Romney \u2019 s claim , the new health care law will not drive government spending up to half of the economy , unless all health care spending in the country is reclassified as government spending . Given that the new law still relies heavily on private insurance provided by employers , it is a stretch to treat all of that as if it were government expenditures .\nExperts predict the new health care law will drive up health spending , as more people will be covered , but not by a huge share of the economy . The chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that with the new law , health care spending will rise to 21 percent of the economy in 2019 . Without the new law , it estimated , it would have risen to 20.8 percent of the economy .\nThe Congressional Budget Office recently estimated what would happen to federal spending under a number of different situations , taking the new health care law into account . The projection showing the biggest jump found that assuming that a number of current tax cuts are extended and several budget cuts currently scheduled to take effect next year are averted , federal spending will rise to 29 percent of the economy in 2030 from 24 percent in 2011 . But that rise is attributable in large part to rising interest payments required by ballooning debt .\nAnd the idea that the United States has almost ceased to be a free-market economy was labeled \u201c ridiculously false \u201d by PolitiFact , which cited an economic freedom index from the Heritage Foundation , a conservative research group , which ranks the United States the world \u2019 s 10th freest economy of 179 judged .\n\u201c A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didn \u2019 t need them and weren \u2019 t even asking for them. \u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\nMr. Obama makes it sound as if the surpluses projected at the end of President Bill Clinton \u2019 s tenure disappeared entirely because of Mr. Bush \u2019 s tax cuts . In fact , tax cuts for the wealthy were responsible for a small fraction of the disappearing surpluses .\nAn analysis by the Congressional Budget Office last year showed that of $ 5.6 trillion in surpluses projected over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office , $ 1.6 trillion went to the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 , or 29 percent . The rest of the anticipated surpluses vanished because of increased spending and lower-than-expected revenues stemming from economic downturns .\nMr. Obama supports keeping the tax cuts for all but the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans , or roughly 18 percent of the total cost . Extrapolated , that means the tax cuts \u201c for people who didn \u2019 t need them \u201d would have accounted for just 5 percent of the disappearing surpluses .",
