The popular picture of how politics works \u2014 reaching across the aisle , twisting arms , building coalitions behind common-sense policy \u2014 has clung to America \u2019 s self-conception long after the underlying structural features that enabled bipartisanship fundamentally shifted . What enabled bipartisanship was , to simplify matters , the existence of socially liberal Republicans in the Northeast and Democrats in the South who were fiscally conservative and virulently racist . Ideologically heterogeneous parties meant that transactional , cross-party coalitions were relatively easy to come by . Over the past several decades , the parties have polarized , i.e. , sorted themselves ideologically ( that \u2019 s what the GOP \u2019 s \u201c Southern strategy \u201d was about ) . Racist conservative Democrats became Republicans and social liberals became Democrats . The process has now all but completed : The rightmost national Democrat is now to the left of the leftmost national Republican . Crucially , however , the process of polarization has been asymmetrical . While almost all liberals have become Democrats and almost all conservatives have become Republicans , far more Republicans self-identify as conservative than Democrats do as liberal , and consequently the GOP has moved much further right than the Democratic Party has left . Part of the explanation is that there has been a demographic sorting as well .
