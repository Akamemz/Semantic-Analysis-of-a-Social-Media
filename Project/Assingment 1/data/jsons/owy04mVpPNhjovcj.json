    "content": "Senate Democrats are about to get rolled on Donald Trump \u2019 s Cabinet picks . They could spend years in the minority . And instead of the GOP collapse that many expected on Nov. 8 , it \u2019 s now Democrats soul-searching about what went wrong .\nBut as Harry Reid prepares to leave the Senate this month after 34 years in Washington , he says everything is just fine with his party , thank you .\nTo hear Reid tell it , the party \u2019 s electoral collapse wasn \u2019 t a result of poor messaging or even a bad candidate . It stemmed from looser campaign finance rules , FBI Director James Comey and the influence of a few powerful individuals \u2014 namely the Koch brothers , his long-running nemeses . The outgoing Senate minority leader is unapologetic on behalf of his party , and remains resolute that Democrats don \u2019 t need to chart a new political course after their 2016 debacle .\n\u201c They have Trump , I understand that . But I don \u2019 t think the Democratic Party is in that big of trouble , \u201d Reid said in a half-hour interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday , one day before he \u2019 ll deliver his farewell address . \u201c I mean , if Comey kept his mouth shut , we would have picked up a couple more Senate seats and we probably would have elected Hillary . \u201d\nAnd Reid not only refused to admit any misgivings about invoking the \u201c nuclear option \u201d for most nominations \u2014 a move that \u2019 s backfiring now by empowering Republicans \u2014 he predicted it \u2019 s just a matter of time before the filibuster is done away with altogether .\nThough the filibuster is Democrats \u2019 best weapon against Trump , Reid said it would be a \u201c mistake \u201d for his party to reflexively oppose whatever Trump proposes . But the outgoing minority leader also wants Democrats to stand firm for their core principles , urging lawmakers to do \u201c everything in their power \u201d to block \u201c wacky \u201d Supreme Court nominees and to not be \u201c complicit \u201d in supporting GOP priorities like tax cuts for the rich and repealing Obamacare .\nAnd Reid called a Republican senator a \u201c loser \u201d for his tirades against the Affordable Care Act , Reid \u2019 s signature legislative accomplishment as majority leader . It was a reprise of Reid 's famous put-down of George W. Bush a decade ago .\nThe no-apologies , no-regrets posture was true to form for the blunt-spoken son of Searchlight , Nevada , who scrapped his way to the pinnacle of power in the U.S. Senate .\nBut this is hardly the scenario that Reid envisioned for his departure : with a President-elect Trump and all-GOP Congress firmly in control of Washington . And Reid \u2019 s most controversial move as leader \u2014 invoking the \u201c nuclear option \u201d on Senate confirmations \u2014 will leave his party essentially powerless to halt Trump \u2019 s Cabinet selections .\nReid insisted that it was the right thing to do .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s my biggest achievement , but I \u2019 m satisfied we did it . We had to . Look at why it was done , \u201d said Reid , who turned 77 this month . \u201c We got almost 100 judges approved \u2026 we saved the integrity of different agencies of government . No , think of what our country would \u2019 ve been without that . \u201d\nReid predicted that the 60-vote filibuster threshold for legislation and for Supreme Court nominees will ultimately disappear altogether \u2014 calling it a natural evolution of the chamber .\nThe rules are \u201c going to erode , it \u2019 s just a question of when , \u201d Reid said . \u201c You can \u2019 t have a democracy decided by 60 out of 100 , and that \u2019 s why changing the rules is one of the best things that has happened to America in a long time . It \u2019 s good for us , it \u2019 s good for them . \u201d\nRepublicans blame Reid for most of the Senate \u2019 s stagnation in recent years , and his evisceration of the filibuster is one of their prime examples . Reid \u2019 s decision to water down the filibuster prompted now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) to declare that the Nevada Democrat will be remembered as the \u201c worst majority leader ever . \u201d\nThree years later , Reid says he understands why McConnell responded the way he did .\n\u201c I have no ill will toward him . He was mad , \u201d Reid said . \u201c He got his rear end kicked , OK ? \u201d\nReid even admitted that while he disagreed with McConnell \u2019 s retaliatory tactics , which led to Merrick Garland being blocked from being confirmed to the Supreme Court , he had to give Republicans credit for the result : control of Congress and the White House and , in all likelihood , a more conservative Supreme Court in time .\n\u201c Mitch rolled the dice , and he won . I told him personally : \u2018 Mitch , I disagreed with how you did it , but it \u2019 s admirable that you did it , \u2019 \u201d Reid recounted .\nBut though Reid largely spared McConnell from criticism despite their often-frosty relationship , not all Republicans escaped his wrath during the interview . After he changed the Senate rules in 2013 , Republicans came to the floor daily to denounce his leadership . One of them , Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming , hit a nerve with his criticisms of Reid and the ACA .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s the deal with him . He came to the floor every day to berate Obamacare . He became the laughingstock of the Democratic Caucus . What good did he do ? Nothing ! I sent Durbin out once in a while to make him look like a fool , \u201d Reid said . \u201c The point is , he lost . He was frustrated . \u201d\nBarrasso was reluctant to respond . Pressed , he shot back at Reid : \u201c He \u2019 s entitled to his opinion . And America has its own opinion . \u201d\nIn some quarters of the GOP , Sen. Harry Reid \u2019 s retirement is already drawing out praise . | John Shinkle/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nDemocrats , though , are confident that history will remember Reid more kindly .\nSen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) , who voted against Reid as minority leader in 2014 after the Democrats \u2019 shellacking in the election that year , predicted that \u201c Republicans and Democrats will reflect fondly on his tenacity . It \u2019 s one thing when you \u2019 re in the battle . It \u2019 s another thing when the battle \u2019 s a long time ago . \u201d\n\u201c It was a masterful effort , and his critics who dismiss him as ineffective are ignoring the obvious , \u201d added Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin , the second-ranking Senate Democrat , of Reid \u2019 s legislative record . \u201c He \u2019 s left a great legacy . \u201d\nIn some quarters of the GOP , Reid \u2019 s retirement is already drawing praise . Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , a key ally of McConnell \u2019 s , said he met privately with Reid every time he was readying a major bill for the floor .\n\u201c Without fail , he \u2019 s made it easier to pass the bill , \u201d Alexander said . \u201c He \u2019 s helped me create an environment to succeed . \u201d\nThat sentiment is more popular among veteran senators than newer members .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have any sense of nostalgia about Harry Reid , \u201d said Sen. Tim Scott ( R-S.C. ) .\nReid is generally not one for nostalgia , either . But he recalls a time more than 40 years ago , when he became lieutenant governor alongside Mike O \u2019 Callaghan , the former governor who , like Reid , had little state government experience until he and Reid were elected in 1970 .\nOne of the first tasks for the newly elected lieutenant governor was attending a state budget meeting . It was staffed by seasoned bureaucrats whom Reid knew were much more experienced and knowledgeable than either him or O \u2019 Callaghan .\n\u201c And that \u2019 s how I kind of felt during my career , \u201d Reid said . \u201c I \u2019 m sure there are people more capable than I , better looking than me , better educated than me , smarter than me .
