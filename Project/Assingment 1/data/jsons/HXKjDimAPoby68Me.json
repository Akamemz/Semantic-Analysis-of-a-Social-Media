But the founders would have been appalled at the suggestion that such measures are illegitimate solely because their result would be that the president is no longer the president . If that didn \u2019 t faze them even when the result could have been to hand the presidency to the president \u2019 s rival , it certainly wouldn \u2019 t faze them today , when it would hand the presidency to the president \u2019 s own handpicked running mate. \u201d Stephen I. Vladeck , New York Times\n\u201c The argument is often made that Trump has done wrong but that our marathon course should run through the voting booth , not the impeachment process : Let the electorate make the call . This argument leaves me incredulous given where we are in the course of events . The president appears to have attempted to direct the considerable powers of his office toward eroding the integrity of the electoral process . This is like saying that we should let the outcome of the boxing match determine whether the guy accused of having lead in his gloves has lead in his gloves. \u201d Danielle Allen , Washington Post\n\u201c The evidence that has surfaced thus far indicates that Trump orchestrated a mob-style shakedown , withholding nearly $ 400 million in military aid and a promised White House meeting in an attempt to coerce Zelensky into investigating \u2014 and publicly smearing \u2014 Joe Biden and his son Hunter . The play-ball-with-us message was apparently delivered not just by the president himself but also by various emissaries\u2026 In other words , Trump was actively and personally colluding with a foreign government to interfere in our coming presidential election . No wonder Republicans prefer to pound the table about process . \u201d Eugene Robinson , Washington Post\nRegarding the charges themselves , \u201c There \u2019 s no question that Trump was deeply involved in pressuring Ukraine . He even released a partial transcript showing it . In Watergate , everyone knew there was a crime , and the question was who did it . In the Ukraine scandal , everyone knows who did it . The only debate is whether it \u2019 s a crime , or perhaps a high crime\u2026 In earlier stages of the process , Republicans and Trump defenders could hide behind a series of excuses : The whistle-blower didn \u2019 t have firsthand knowledge , or there wasn \u2019 t really a quid pro quo , or the Ukrainians didn \u2019 t understand it as a quid pro quo , or maybe Trump didn \u2019 t know what was going on . But the testimony has shredded each of these , as witnesses with direct knowledge speak and more becomes clear about the Ukrainian side and Trump \u2019 s own involvement. \u201d David A. Graham , The Atlantic\nSome note , \u201c Trump \u2019 s critics will dismiss the vote as a procedural affair , which is almost always a straight party-line vote in the House . But in other ways , this resolution\u2014merely affirming an impeachment investigation , not judging any articles themselves\u2014should have been the easiest for Republicans to go along with . Instead , lawmakers once again retreated to their corners of comfort . Trump will begin the formal impeachment process with his party still behind him , the House having sent a signal of GOP unity to potential wobblers in the Senate\u2026 Count this initial vote as a win for the president . \u201d Russell Berman , The Atlantic\n\u201c Mr . Trump and his lawyers will have the opportunity to make statements , question witnesses and call their own , with the concurrence of the committee chairman . The rules are virtually identical to those adopted by Republicans when they pursued the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 \u2014 which makes their breathless claims about a \u2018 Soviet \u2019 process ludicrous as well as dishonest . One wrinkle is a provision that if Mr. Trump \u2018 unlawfully \u2019 refuses to make witnesses available or produce documents \u2014 as he has so far \u2014 the committee chair may restrict the president \u2019 s privileges . It seems only reasonable that Mr. Trump should not be allowed to call his own witnesses while blocking those sought by Democrats. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c The resolution undermines the president \u2019 s political defense . Republicans argued the House \u2019 s inquiry is a \u2018 sham process. \u2019 Absent an impeachment resolution , they say , the investigation lacked transparency , due process rights for the president and the validity of a House vote . They had a point . Until now\u2026 But perhaps most important , the resolution details the specific roles of committees and members\u2026 Several committees and chairmen can , and surely have , made legitimate arguments to be central participants in the impeachment inquiry . This resolution , like any offensive strategy , clearly delineates the role various powerful members and committees will play. \u201d Joshua C. Huder , New York Times\nThe right is critical of the resolution and impeachment in general .\nThe right is critical of the resolution and impeachment in general .\n\u201c If Democrats had uncovered a truly serious crime in this probe , that would likely convince at least 20 Senate Republicans to make Mike Pence president . The core problem is that Ukraine-Gate does n't appear to involve an explicit statutory crime at all , but instead an alleged abuse of authority to gain political advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden . The House can decide what constitutes an impeachable offense , but the Senate decides whether it 's even worthy of a full trial , let alone a removal . An impeachment without a removal will , in the end , look a lot like a political campaign no matter how much Pelosi improves the process . \u201d\n\u201c The base problem is Trump never said he was withholding aid in the July 25 call . The earliest tick the Ukrainians knew the aid was being delayed was \u2018 early August \u2019 and even that is based on anonymous media sources who somehow have not been found to testify . Official U.S. and Ukrainian officials instead say knowledge the funds were held up didn \u2019 t get to the Ukrainians until late August , shortly before they were released\u2026\n\u201c [ Furthermore ] nothing happened . Trump never asked the attorney general to contact Zelensky . It is unclear who if anyone Guiliani spoke with , but either way the Ukrainians never investigated anything . This impeachment will be the first in American history without any underlying actual crime taking place on the ground . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats want to impeach Mr. Trump for asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival for corruption , though the probe never happened , and for withholding aid to Ukraine that in the end wasn \u2019 t withheld . Assuming the facts bear this out , the attempt was self-serving and reckless and a long way from the \u2018 perfect \u2019 behavior Mr. Trump claims . But Democrats will need more than the facts on the public record so far to justify short-circuiting a Presidency . Their partisan rush to impeachment suggests that their real purpose is revenge for the humiliation of having lost in 2016 to a man they think is unworthy of the office . The impeachers have the burden of showing why this shouldn \u2019 t all be left to the judgment of American voters in 2020 . \u201d\nSome argue that \u201c President Trump deserves to face an impeachment hearing , but his Republican defenders are right that Democrats still aren \u2019 t promising a fair process\u2026 As it stands right now , the resolution is woefully inadequate , nonsensical , and unjust . It leaves the wrong committee largely in charge of the process ; it affords Republican congressmen too little opportunity to call witnesses ; it keeps too many of the proceedings behind closed doors ; and it still does not provide any specifics as to when and how the president \u2019 s own counsel will be allowed to rebut allegations against him . If this is how the impeachment investigation will proceed , it will fail to persuade large portions of the public that the allegations are legitimate . \u201d\n\u201c The House Democratic caucus has 233 members . In a group that large , many members will be role-players . Some members are serious policymakers . Some are mostly communicators . Some are deal-makers . Adam Schiff \u2019 s value to his party is his willingness to be a partisan attack dog who is willing to baldly speak untruths to the television cameras . It is normal and expected for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to have Schiff play a role . But to put Schiff in charge of the impeachment process reveals what sort of thing the Democrats are up to \u2014 and finding the truthis not the main goal . \u201d\n[ Ukranian President ] \u201c Zelensky has said repeatedly that he never felt extorted in his July 25 phone call with Trump . Zelensky told journalists on September 25 , \u2018 Nobody pushed me. \u2019 During extensive discussions with some 300 journalists in Kyiv , Zelensky said on October 10 : \u2018 There was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S. \u2019 The available evidence , from the supposed victim of Trump \u2019 s vise , is : What vise ? \u2026\n\u201c Zero Republicans voted for this impeachment resolution . Unlike the multi-party votes in favor of opening impeachment actions against presidents Clinton , Nixon , and Andrew Johnson , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and all but two Democrats voted to begin the effort to unseat President Trump with no backing whatsoever from the president \u2019 s own party . Thirty-one Democrats joined Republicans to launch impeachment against Democrat Clinton .
