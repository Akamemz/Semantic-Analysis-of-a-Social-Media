    "content": "The Obama administration unveiled the first major national safety restrictions for fracking on Friday , touching off a swift backlash from the president \u2019 s critics in Congress and the energy industry .\nTwo oil industry groups immediately sued to challenge the rules , calling them \u201c a reaction to unsubstantiated concerns , \u201d while 27 Senate Republicans introduced legislation to block them from taking effect . Meanwhile , green groups were divided on whether the long-awaited regulations go far enough .\n\u201c The political reaction is not surprising , \u201d Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told reporters Friday after her department released the finished rules . But she added , \u201c We \u2019 re confident from the process we went through that we \u2019 re doing the right thing for the American people . \u201d\nThe new rules are the federal government \u2019 s most comprehensive foray to date toward regulating the technology at the heart of the U.S. oil and gas boom , addressing worries such as potential dangers to drinking water . They also offered oil and gas supporters new room to accuse President Barack Obama of seeking to throttle fossil-fuel production , despite his repeated boasts about the nation \u2019 s booming energy supplies .\nAt the same time , the rules fall short of environmentalists \u2019 biggest demands for oversight of fracking operations \u2014 let alone some groups \u2019 calls for an all-out ban .\nInterior \u2019 s regulations apply only to land owned by the federal government or Indian tribes , so they won \u2019 t end the current patchwork of state laws and local ordinances governing the practice in hot spots like Pennsylvania , south Texas and North Dakota . But the industry and its supporters in Congress still call it an overreach , arguing that greens are massively exaggerating the dangers and that states are adequately regulating the industry already .\n\u201c If Interior was half as interested in new production as it is in new regulation , our nation would be in a far better place , \u201d said Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski , who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee .\nErik Milito , the American Petroleum Institute \u2019 s upstream operations director , issued a statement Friday that the rules threaten to create a \u201c duplicative layer of new federal regulation. \u201d He added : \u201c Despite the renaissance on state and private lands , energy production on federal lands has fallen , and this rule is just one more barrier to growth . \u201d\nTwo other industry groups \u2014 the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Western Energy Alliance \u2014 swiftly filed a federal lawsuit Friday in Wyoming attacking the rules . Senate Republicans , including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , didn \u2019 t even wait for the rule to come out before filing their hostile legislation late Thursday .\nOn the other side of the aisle , top House Natural Resources Committee Democrat Ra\u00fal Grijalva lamented that the rules represent \u201c the lowest common denominator . \u201d\n\u201c Instead of offering clarity and protecting our resources , today \u2019 s rule lets industry off the hook , \u201d the Arizona Democrat said .\nStill , the liberal Center for American Progress says the regulations are an important step .\n\u201c As with any rule , you can \u2019 t please everyone and you can \u2019 t make it perfect , but the rule will absolutely be a huge leap forward toward safer wells , improved transparency , and better protections for nearby communities , \u201d Matt Lee-Ashley , director of the group \u2019 s public lands project , said by email .\n\u201c Current federal well-drilling regulations are more than 30 years old and they simply have not kept pace with the technical complexities of today \u2019 s hydraulic fracturing operations , \u201d she said in a statement . \u201c This updated and strengthened rule provides a framework of safeguards and disclosure protocols that will allow for the continued responsible development of our federal oil and gas resources . \u201d\nThe debate touches on some of the most dominant energy issues of Obama \u2019 s presidency . Fracking , or hydraulic fracturing \u2014 which involves injecting water , sand and chemicals underground to break up oil- and gas-rich shale formations \u2014 has helped create boom towns in once-unlikely states while turning the U.S. into a rising energy superpower .\nThe resulting surge in domestic supplies during the past eight years has helped drive a swoon in oil and gas prices , putting money into consumers \u2019 pockets and strengthening the United States \u2019 hand against rival energy producers like Iran and Russia . But it has also weakened the bottom lines of many oil and gas producers , making them vulnerable to what Dan Naatz , a senior vice president at the Independent Petroleum Association of America , described as a regulatory \u201c death by a thousand cuts . \u201d\nKathleen Sgamma , a vice president at the industry group Western Energy Alliance , agreed that the withering downturn in oil prices \u201c strengthens their hand \u201d at Interior .\n\u201c The industry is weaker and won \u2019 t be able to fight back , \u201d she said in an interview about the upcoming fracking regulations . \u201c If they \u2019 re out on public lands where [ drilling activity ] is already more marginal , this is blood in the water . \u201d\nAnti-fracking activists had denounced an earlier draft from Interior as too weak , saying the president should do more to tamp down oil and gas production amid worries about illnesses , damaged roads , explosive fuel trains and even earthquakes , which some scientists suspect have been triggered by underground disposal of drilling waste .\nAmy Mall , a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council , said her group would stay worried about fracking \u2019 s effects on pollution and public health \u201c even if this rule were absolutely perfect , the strongest it could be , with rigorous penalties for noncompliance . \u201d\n\u201c Because none of those rules are strong enough and enforced enough , \u201d she added , and \u201c because we \u2019 re very concerned about how much oil and gas BLM is permitting and the process they \u2019 re using . \u201d\nInterior is expected to follow up in the next few months with new standards for the burning of fracking-generated methane gas , which can contribute to global warming .

That study could lead to even broader attempts at regulation , including on the private or state-owned lands where the vast majority of fracking occurs .\nThe rules released Friday will have an especially large impact in the West , where drillers on federal and tribal lands will have to abide by new standards for well construction and the management of fracking waste fluids .
