    "content": "House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz has been quietly planning a probe into the federal government 's record keeping \u2014 an investigation he acknowledges could put Hillary Clinton in the cross hairs .\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 published Tuesday , Chaffetz said the probe would n't focus on Clinton , but `` when she creates her own private email system , she 's ensnarled herself . ''\nBut on Wednesday evening , Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy summoned Chaffetz ( R-Utah ) to the Capitol to let him know that he is not permitted to launch an investigation that involves Clinton in any way .\nRyan and McCarthy have been clear from the beginning : They believe the FBI and Justice Department should handle the investigation into Clinton \u2019 s use of personal email for government business , and that congressional involvement could disrupt the criminal probe and give the appearance of a GOP witch hunt .\nRyan , however , had given Chaffetz a green light to proceed \u2014 with caution \u2014 investigating systematic problems within his committee \u2019 s broad jurisdiction , while making clear his preference that Chaffetz steer clear of Clinton personally .\nNow , following the \u2588\u2588\u2588 story , GOP leadership says he may not even investigate systematic issues if they involve Clinton .\nTheir directive puts Chaffetz in a position where he would have to investigate government officials \u2019 use of personal email and Freedom of Information Act requests without looking at the person who many say has violated transparency principles the most .\nThe back and forth comes just a day after the House Science Committee , which recently launched its own investigation into Clinton \u2019 s email server , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 it has changed direction and is now opting to delay its inquiry and defer to the FBI .\nChaffetz hadn \u2019 t scheduled a hearing yet , but the Utah Republican has obtained new information , according to sources close to the committee . Chaffetz said the probe will be larger than Clinton but that she \u2019 s right in the middle of it .\n\u201c The Oversight Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal Records Act , and we intend to pursue that , \u201d Chaffetz said in an interview this week before the GOP talked to him Wednesday evening . \u201c We also have jurisdiction on FOIA [ the Freedom of Information Act ] , so if you \u2019 re not providing emails , it begs the question of your compliance under FOIA . So , I \u2019 m not specifically trying to target the secretary , but when she creates her own private email system , she \u2019 s ensnarled herself . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c I \u2019 m trying to be as cautious as I can . I don \u2019 t think we should be any harder on her , but I don \u2019 t think we should be any easier on her . It \u2019 s bigger and broader than just Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nWithin House Republican leadership , there is heightened sensitivity to congressional scrutiny of Clinton . Ryan prefers that federal authorities handle any potential criminal elements of Clinton \u2019 s email scandal , while Rep. Trey Gowdy \u2019 s House Select Committee on Benghazi handle anything related to Benghazi .\nRep. Lamar Smith of Texas , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee , decided to delay his look at Clinton \u2019 s private email server after House Republican leadership expressed unease . An aide on the panel said the \u201c committee temporarily will defer to the FBI \u2019 s expanding investigation , \u201d citing new information that 22 emails on Clinton \u2019 s server were top secret .\n\u201c We expect the FBI to do its job and fully investigate cyber vulnerabilities that may have resulted from former Secretary Clinton \u2019 s decision to deviate from established cybersecurity standards and requirements , \u201d the aide said .\nChaffetz said he \u2019 s sensitive to the FBI investigation , but that won \u2019 t stop him .\n\u201c The FBI should pursue any violations and criminal allegations , \u201d Chaffetz said . \u201c I would argue we also have jurisdictional prerogative on Federal Records Act and FOIA [ matters ] . We \u2019 re being very cautious . I don \u2019 t want to overstep , but we \u2019 re also trying to move forward . \u201d\nTop Republicans seem divided over the wisdom of Chaffetz \u2019 s move . Some believe it \u2019 s a legitimate exercise of his oversight authority . But others think he \u2019 s on a partisan fishing expedition that will unavoidably target Clinton .\nFar from looking to protect Clinton , Ryan and McCarthy simply believe they should leave criminal matters to the FBI . Congressional interference would look ham-handed , overly partisan and could disrupt the federal investigation , the GOP leaders believe , according to sources close to them .\nChaffetz says his investigation will deal with systematic issues across the government . He \u2019 s aiming to examine noncompliance with FOIA , as well as the use of personal email for government business and how it could affect record-keeping policies . He said the use of private emails to conduct government business is \u201c bigger and broader than just problems at the State Department . \u201d\n\u201c They seem to be the worst offender , but you also have this problem at the Department of Defense , \u201d Chaffetz said . \u201c Anybody who would use a nongovernment server to interact on government business is in violation . That \u2019 s just been known for a long time , that is the law . [ Clinton ] is by no means the only violator . I \u2019 m still looking at it from 60,000 feet , and wondering who \u2019 s violating it , how are they doing it and how do we get them to be in compliance . The inspectors general keep issuing reports , and we \u2019 re not ignoring those . \u201d\nChaffetz , however , has long sought a role in investigating Clinton \u2014 as has his committee , which is filled with conservative lawmakers .\n\u201c I \u2019 m with the chairman on this , \u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) , the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus , who sits on the oversight panel . \u201c Look , we have jurisdiction over [ the ] Federal Records Act . And if it \u2019 s appropriate , and I think it is , for us to look at that , I think we should do it in a professional way . Look , there were 60,000 emails . She got to decide which ones were private and which ones went to State Department . Then the State Department got to further screen . We have yet to learn the date parameters , search terms , who had the final say \u201d over which emails to make available as public records .\nIn a Capitol filled with politicians brimming with ambition , the 48-year-old Chaffetz stands out . Just eight years into his congressional career , he chairs a committee with sweeping jurisdiction over the federal bureaucracy . He has considered running for the Senate , launched a quixotic bid against his former close friend McCarthy for speaker last fall and now is publicly musing about running for governor of Utah in 2020 .\nFormer Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) blocked Chaffetz from getting anywhere near the investigation .
