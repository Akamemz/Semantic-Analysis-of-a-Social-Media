    "content": "On October 21 , U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) Administrator Jim Bridenstine told the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology that he foresees NASA will land astronauts on the moon by 2035 . \u201c We need to learn how to live and work in another world , \u201d he told lawmakers . \u201c The moon is the best place to prove those capabilities and technologies . \u201d\nThe article that follows comprises the sixth instalment in \u201c Our Martian Moment , \u201d a multi-part \u2588\u2588\u2588 series in which our authors discuss what kind of society humans should build on Mars if and when we succeed in colonizing the red planet .\nFor science-fiction writers , Mars always has been a blank slate on which to write our hopes and project our fears . Ray Bradbury imagined a Mars settled by farmers who cover the red planet with idyllic midwestern American towns . Robert Heinlein , swept up in 1960s counterculture , imagined a Mars where gnostic aliens teach free love , spiritual wisdom and psychic powers to a hippy messiah . More recently , Kim Stanley Robinson \u2019 s Red Mars trilogy\u2014science fiction \u2019 s War and Peace\u2014imagines a Mars strangely like Berkeley , with a gig economy that allows citizens to spend an inordinate amount of time hiking and pursuing other outdoor recreations . Entrepreneurs , too , use Mars as their canvas\u2014including Elon Musk , who imagines a Martian society that features a system of direct democracy stripped of terrestrial bureaucracy .\nIn a distant , idealized future , life on Mars will be normalized , with the dangers inherent in interplanetary colonization having been mitigated by redundant infrastructure , a steady supply of food , water and air , and a growing wealth surplus . At such a time , we can suppose , some utopian project would be possible and even likely . But until such time , Martian lives will depend on delicate and unpredictable technical processes and life-support systems . And so the organization of Martian society will have to be based around a disciplined and rigorously meritocratic technocracy . The political overlay , whose decision-making protocols would be invoked only in regard to non-critical issues , would have to be an extension of our terrestrial government : To experiment with new forms of government during the perilous start-up period would be dangerous .\nHere , the vision of Star Trek is closer to the truth than the writings of Bradbury or Robinson . Star Trek portrays an overarching organization\u2014the United Federation of Planets\u2014which delegates enormous power to Starfleet , a uniformed space force characterized by military discipline and a strong tradition of meritocracy . Civilian administrators assert their primacy in the Star Trek universe , but typically only in contexts where there are no acute military , logistical or environmental risks .\nMars is a harsh world . The atmosphere is so thin that it might as well be a complete vacuum , and temperatures can get low enough to freeze carbon dioxide . There is negligible protection from radiation . Gravitational acceleration on the surface of Mars is only about 40 % of Earth \u2019 s gravity , which may present long-term dangers to any species that evolved on our planet . It is not at all obvious that Martian soil could ever grow Earth crops . For the first settlers , death by asphyxiation , hypothermia , dehydration and starvation will always be a clear and present danger . And so every aspect of operations will have to be conducted in a way that minimizes risk .\nOur best model for a Martian colonization program is the Apollo program , which landed the first humans on the moon\u2014though even in this case , technical compromises were made in order to keep the program funded . For example , manufacturing and development were spread around the United States during the 1960s as a means to attract the support of federal legislators who might otherwise cut funding . Each stage of the Saturn V rocket had a different manufacturer , complicating integration and assembly . And the tight timeline that John F. Kennedy had demanded entailed unnecessary risks . It required , for instance , an \u201c all up \u201d testing strategy for the Saturn V ( as opposed to testing each stage individually and repeatedly ) , a dangerous gamble that fortunately paid off .\nIn other respects , however , the program was run on a technically rigorous basis . NASA required that astronauts be well-educated ( preferably with a degree in engineering ) and have extensive flying experience ( preferably as a test pilot ) . Candidates were expected to have repeatedly demonstrated an extraordinary ability to remain calm under pressure . They also had to be in perfect health . ( Deke Slayton , one of the best performing astronauts , was grounded for years because of an irregular heart rhythm . )\nConsider the pedigree of the most famous of the Apollo astronauts , Neil Armstrong . As a child , he was obsessed with science , engineering and flight . He worked odd jobs to raise enough money to pay for flying lessons in Wapakoneta , Ohio , and hitchhiked to a nearby grass airstrip to take lessons . He earned his junior pilot license at 16 , before he could drive . He served as a pilot in the Korean war , and during one mission over North Korean airspace , lost part of a wing . Armstrong somehow managed to climb from treetop level to 14,000 feet , and fly his crippled F9F Panther back to South Korean airspace before ejecting .\nDuring the Gemini 8 mission , a short circuit caused a yaw thruster to misfire , sending Armstrong \u2019 s ship into a roll and then a tumble that reached a frequency of one rotation per second . Armstrong \u2019 s voice was eerily calm as he explained the problem and wrested back control , all the while\u2014as he euphemistically put it later\u2014 \u201c physiological limits were being approached . \u201d\nReaders can watch on YouTube as Armstrong aborts a 1969 flight on the LLTV ( Lunar Landing Training Vehicle ) , an ungainly machine meant to approximate the experience of piloting the Lunar Landing Module , little more than a jet engine that the pilot balanced atop . On one training flight , Armstrong \u2019 s LLTV controls failed and the vehicle began to roll over . He ejected at the last possible moment . As the LLTV exploded and burned , Armstrong brushed himself off , answered a few questions , and then drove to the office for a full day \u2019 s work . The other Apollo astronauts had similarly impressive back stories .\nYet our era has a complicated relationship with the idea of meritocracy , which some now present as an illusion that operates as a mask for privilege . One prominent academic tours the United States advising colleges on their human-resources policies , instructing academics that the words \u201c I believe the most qualified person should get the job \u201d comprise a form of \u201c microagression. \u201d Other university professors claim that even the articulation of \u201c objective \u201d baselines can be seen as part and parcel of \u201c white supremacy culture . \u201d\nThis shift in attitude was illustrated by coverage of the fiftieth anniversary of the Apollo landing in the New York Times . Much of the coverage was dedicated to attacking Apollo \u2019 s lack of diversity .

And I wish there \u2019 d been a female astronaut with him . But given the fierce competition for these roles , and the lopsided demographics of the pool from which NASA was recruiting , it wasn \u2019 t surprising that the selected individuals were all white men .\nThe fault lay less with NASA than with the racism and sexism that caused the talent pipeline to be so constrained . And once NASA and related organizations managed to diversify the talent entering that training pipeline , they went on to have a laudable record of diversity .
