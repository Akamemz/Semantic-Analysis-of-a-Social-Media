    "content": "Well , it \u2019 s in the hands of Bill Barr . It \u2019 s not here in the sense that we can publicly consume it and see what Bob Mueller found . It has just moved from one pocket , which we can \u2019 t see into , into another pocket that we can \u2019 t see into .\nBut it has moved pockets , at least , which is something . Something we \u2019 ve been waiting two years for .\nFrom The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is a special episode of \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : The Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general . It \u2019 s Friday afternoon , March 22 . So Mike , talk me through your day today .\nSo knowing it was going to be a big day , I turned on the recorder as soon as I left the house this morning and made my way into the office to hurry up and wait .\nmichael schmidt We expect the report to be finished today around noon .\nmichael schmidt I got a call from the office from my editor wanting to know what I knew . Told her I knew nothing . Last thing an editor wants to hear \u2014 nothing new .\nspeaker Excuse me . michael schmidt Yes ? speaker Do you know where the Jamaican Embassy is ? michael schmidt I do not , I \u2019 m sorry . Do you know what the address is ?\nWas stopped by a woman who couldn \u2019 t find the Jamaican embassy .\nmichael schmidt O.K. , so you \u2019 re going to want to go this way . Go to DuPont Circle , and make a right . Just keep on following that trail . speaker Oh , O.K. , so I \u2019 m going the wrong way . michael schmidt Well , we \u2019 re all going the wrong way .\nmichael schmidt Cold March day . Fairly cold here in Washington . 45 degrees .\nJust had a normal sort of walk into the office .\nmichael schmidt [ HUMMING ] Half a block away , coming up to 17th \u2014\nIt doesn \u2019 t seem like you \u2019 re in a big hurry to get to the office .\nWell , all the work has been done . We know what \u2019 s coming .\nmichael schmidt How are you ? speaker Hey , Mike . michael schmidt What \u2019 s going on ?\nmichael schmidt Big day ? No ? Not a big day ? All right .\nWalk into the office . And everyone wants to know \u2014\nspeaker 1 What do you got ? What do you got ? speaker 2 Chasing the report .\nspeaker This is the question I ask him every five \u2014 michael schmidt Days or \u2014 speaker Days or weeks . michael schmidt Days or weeks ?\nThe whole apparatus of The New York Times is jacked up for this moment .\nmichael schmidt We got Nick here . We \u2019 re all ready . speaker Gang \u2019 s all here .\nThere \u2019 s been a lot of time and planning that \u2019 s gone into this . There \u2019 s a lot of stories that have been written that are ready to go .\nspeaker Does that seem right ? michael schmidt Yep . speaker O.K .\nDean Baquet , our executive editor , calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller , our bureau chief , what do you know ?\nelisabeth bumiller You \u2019 re not so sure about it ? michael schmidt I \u2019 m less sure about the timing , but \u2014\nElizabeth calls me over to her desk , puts him on speakerphone . Mikey , what do you know ?\ndean baquet Do you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get ? michael schmidt My guess is not a lot because I don \u2019 t know what there is to get a heads-up on .\ndean baquet O.K . elisabeth bumiller That \u2019 s what we got . michael schmidt So that \u2019 s all we got . elisabeth bumiller And we have stories ready . Once we get the word from Justice , we just push a button . michael schmidt All the work is done . elisabeth bumiller We \u2019 re just tourists hanging around . michael schmidt We \u2019 re sort of lemmings at this point .\nSo it \u2019 s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts .\narchived recording The special counsel investigation is over . Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump . That report has been submitted . Now the question is , what happens to it ? How much gets released and when ? That is up to the new attorney general , Bill Barr .\nSo what do we know at this stage ? It is Friday afternoon . What \u2019 s our understanding ?\nOur understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them . They have to go through the report , see what \u2019 s there , digest it , and then figure out what to do with it . How much of it should be made public , how much of it should be given to Congress , and how much of it should remain secret .\nIs that really all we know at this point ? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found , if he \u2019 s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House , or how he \u2019 s thinking about this ?\nWe just know that Mueller is done . There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel \u2019 s office in the investigation . If anyone else has gotten caught up in this , they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel \u2019 s office .\nSo the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not . And that \u2019 s still going to take a while for him to figure out .\nCorrect . And it \u2019 s a very difficult process , because if there is criminality in regards to the president , it \u2019 s a very tricky issue to navigate . The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can \u2019 t be indicted . But if the president can \u2019 t be indicted , Congress should deal with that behavior . How do you give that information to Congress ? It \u2019 s not a snap decision you can make \u2014 like , O.K. , Mueller \u2019 s done , this is what he found . Let \u2019 s put this in another box and send it to Congress . It \u2019 s far trickier .\nSo how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report ?\nBarr is in this incredibly difficult spot , because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts . But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in , that his political enemies may want to know , but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done .\nAnd does how the attorney general handles that balance depend , in your mind , Mike , on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends ?\nYes . If Mueller says the president didn \u2019 t break the law , then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously . The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically , because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong . So if Barr learns from Mueller that there \u2019 s no criminality on the president , how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts ? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill ? In a normal criminal investigation , all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime . But this situation is different , because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime . So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey , look , this is what Mueller found . He only found X , Y , and Z . And if we wanted to make a case , he would have needed to have uncovered these other things , which he did not . And that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re confident with his findings .\nAnd on the other hand , if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president , how does Barr have to proceed ?\nWell , how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress ? What should be told to Congress ? Should Congress be told explicitly , look , Mueller believes the president violated these laws , and here \u2019 s the evidence to back it up ? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury ? The Justice Department can \u2019 t just hand over grand jury information to Congress . What if the information is classified ? They \u2019 re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress . They think Congress leaks like a sieve .\nIs it safe to say though , Mike , that if criminality is found by Mueller , Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found ?\nMaybe . Maybe . But look , this is a highly unusual situation . The person who runs the executive branch , the president , has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months . Very awkward situation .\nAnd the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president .\nCorrect . Has the job because the president put him there . So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says , well , how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics ? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts ?\nSo when will we know more ? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front ?\nWhen will we know more ? Barr and his deputies will go through this , and I don \u2019 t know \u2014 sometime in the next few days , sometime in the next few weeks . It may be a difficult process to unbraid . Mueller has been rummaging around the president \u2019 s life for 22 months . We don \u2019 t have clarity into everything Mueller \u2019 s found . What if Barr looks at it and says , eh , Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law . But actually , I don \u2019 t think he has it . Maybe there \u2019 s not enough there . Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found , simply on a legal basis . The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right . Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress , he \u2019 s got to have it right . He \u2019 s not going to have a second chance to say , well , you know , I gave you that stuff . But like , meh , maybe it \u2019 s not what I thought it was . Or , oh , let \u2019 s give you more . He has to get it right the first time . Otherwise , he \u2019 ll look like he \u2019 s waffling .\nAnd how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands ?\nBarr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation . He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another , either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts . So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible . He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country , and that the sooner it is resolved , the sooner the country can move on .\nAnd Mike , what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that \u2019 s sent to Congress , but from something else ? I think we \u2019 re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak , and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory .\nI don \u2019 t know . I mean , the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small . And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this , then the president can start to raise questions about what \u2019 s really going on . It will look nefarious . The Democrats will get their backs up and say , well , if this stuff is leaking out , why can \u2019 t we have access to it ? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here . Obviously , you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report , and they think , ah , screw it , I \u2019 m going to make this public . But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected .",
