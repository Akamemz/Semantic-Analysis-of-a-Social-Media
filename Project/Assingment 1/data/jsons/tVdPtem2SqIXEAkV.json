    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nMinority view : \u201c Mr. Assange is not a free-press hero . Yes , WikiLeaks acquired and published secret government documents , many of them newsworthy\u2026 Contrary to the norms of journalism , however , Mr. Assange sometimes obtained such records unethically\u2026 Also unlike real journalists , WikiLeaks dumped material into the public domain without any effort independently to verify its factuality or give named individuals an opportunity to comment . Nor , needless to say , would a real journalist have cooperated with a plot by an authoritarian regime \u2019 s intelligence service to harm one U.S. presidential candidate and benefit another\u2026 [ Assange ] is long overdue for personal accountability. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\nOne of Assange \u2019 s former colleagues writes , \u201c Assange might be an asshole . Scratch that ; Assange is an asshole . But we \u2019 re going to have to stand up for him anyway . \u201d James Ball , The Atlantic\nSome lament the fact that \u201c the Justice Department is likely to move aggressively to strip Assange of his core defenses\u2026 the government will ask the court to declare that the disclosure of the arguably unconstitutional surveillance program is immaterial . This would leave Assange with only the ability to challenge whether he helped with passwords and little or no opportunity to present evidence of his motivations or the threat to privacy . For the jurors , they could simply be faced with some Australian guy who helped with passwords in hacking national security information . It would be like trying a man for breaking and entering while barring evidence that the house was on fire and he thought he was rescuing people instead. \u201d Jonathan Turley , USA Today\n\u201c Defenders of this indictment will drone on about the centrality of hacking . Fine and good . But powerful people down the road may not draw any such disciplined conclusions from the document ; they may draw the reckless conclusion that the door is now open to insert the federal criminal apparatus more deeply into journalist-source interactions . \u201d Erik Wemple , Washington Post\nYet many argue that the evidence \u201c seems thin , limited mainly to Assange saying he \u2019 d had \u2018 no luck so far , \u2019 apparently in relation to attempts to crack the password . The meatier parts of the indictment speak more to normal journalistic practices . In its press release , the Justice Department noted Assange was \u2018 actively encouraging Manning \u2019 to provide more classified information ... \u201c Reporters have extremely complicated relationships with sources , especially whistleblower types like Manning , who are often under extreme stress and emotionally vulnerable . At different times , you might counsel the same person both for and against disclosure . It \u2019 s proper to work through all the reasons for action in any direction , including weighing the public \u2019 s interest , the effect on the source \u2019 s conscience and mental health , and personal and professional consequences . For this reason , placing criminal penalties on a prosecutor \u2019 s interpretation of such interactions will likely put a scare into anyone involved with national security reporting going forward. \u201d Matt Taibbi , Rolling Stone\n\u201c The Justice Department has made a very deliberate and careful move to focus not on WikiLeaks or Assange \u2019 s publication of classified documents but instead on the one moment in March 2010 when he appeared to briefly cross the line into computer hacking himself ( and not very successfully , at that ) . It \u2019 s an interesting strategy and one that may create other problems for the Justice Department related to extradition and the statute of limitations , but it tries to sidestep concerns about what going after Assange might mean for journalists\u2014a surprisingly cautious and measured choice for this Justice Department. \u201d Josephine Wolff , Slate\n\u201c It \u2019 s notable , and welcome , that Mr. Assange isn \u2019 t being charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 . Journalists including those at the Wall Street Journal sometimes feel the duty to disclose information in the public interest that governments would rather keep secret . Indicting Mr. Assange merely for releasing classified information could have set a precedent that prosecutors might have used in the future against journalists\u2026\n\u201c Helping a source illegally break into government databases isn \u2019 t legitimate journalism\u2026 Mr. Assange has never been a hero of transparency or democratic accountability . His targets always seem to be democratic institutions or governments , not authoritarians . \u201d\n\u201c We can debate the degree to which the First Amendment protects journalists who publish classified information ( a controversial and unsettled question ) ; but journalists have no immunity to commit crimes ( or conspire to commit them , or aid and abet their commission ) , in order to acquire the information that they then publish . \u201d\nI \u2019 m \u201c reflexively uncomfortable with the idea of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) prosecuting publishers for disseminating classified documents . Without whistleblowers and illegal disclosures , governments would often get away with grievous abuses of power . Even if those leaks are politically motivated , and even if the release of those documents fail to offer proper context , in the long run , protecting journalistic institutions that pursue transparency is a net benefit for free society\u2026\n\u201c [ But ] according to the indictment ( and there \u2019 s a chance of additional charges ) , Assange actively attempted to participate in espionage . He didn \u2019 t merely get his hands on information or solicit it . He is accused of conspiring to assist Manning in breaking into U.S. government files and cracking codes\u2026 Manning faced justice , and was sentenced to 35 years at Leavenworth before President Barack Obama commuted the sentence after seven . Why should Assange be spared the same justice ? \u201d\n\u201c There is no virtue in Assange . Those who celebrated his \u2018 transparency \u2019 in the Manning document dumps forget that responsible reporters who gain access to classified material carefully vet that material to make sure that their disclosures do not needlessly endanger innocent Americans , and they carefully weigh the value of the disclosure against the gravity of the harm . Assange and Manning did not seem to care about the men and women they betrayed\u2026\n\u201c Manning didn \u2019 t carefully extract evidence of alleged wrongdoing from classified files and go to the press ( a defensible , though still illegal , act ) . He just dumped hundreds of thousands of pages of classified files into Assange \u2019 s hands , and Assange posted them , en masse , on the Internet . Any jihadist or enemy with Internet access could read the documents and not just learn about the identities of American allies on the ground ( placing them at immediate , mortal risk ) but also gain extraordinary insight into American military tactics and plans . \u201d\n\u201c How many Iraqis and Afghans named in reports for being helpful to U.S. troops were later killed or abused for their cooperation ? How many business people , reporters , or professors who took the time to meet with U.S. diplomats lost their jobs when their willingness to talk and provide insight became publicly known ? How many people around the world will hesitate to cooperate with American officials in the future , suspecting that their assistance might be exposed ? ... We will never know the true human toll of the classified information compromised by Assange and Manning . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war .
