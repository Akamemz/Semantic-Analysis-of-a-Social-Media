    "content": "Republicans will have to go on record against giving minimum-wage workers a raise and potentially vote against a plan meant to defend pregnant workers from discrimination . Democrats will take sides on Iran \u2019 s nuclear talks , with Republicans daring them to side against Israel .\nAnd each party is trying to outdo the other on how much it loves Medicare .\nThe Senate \u2019 s famous budget \u201c vote-a-rama \u201d on Thursday won \u2019 t change any laws \u2014 far from it , it \u2019 s a daylong , only-in-Congress charade , the main purpose of which is to make the other party look bad and score political points .\nAnd yet it has the potential to be among the most consequential days in Congress this year . Some of the roll calls are bound to show up in campaign ads and talking points and floor speeches : Just ask Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) , who was attacked by her GOP opponent , Scott Brown , two weeks before her 2014 reelection for voting to \u201c pave the way \u201d for a carbon tax , a vote that was more than 18 months old at the time .\n\u201c So many attacks are not based in the substance of what we do here , \u201d Shaheen sighed when reminded of Brown \u2019 s broadside .\nIndeed , no other day of Congress elicits as many campaign advertisements as the vote-a-rama . Republicans are defending 24 seats in 2016 , and the most vulnerable senators are already bracing for Democrats to find avenues of attack for the campaign trail .\n\u201c I doubt very seriously anybody \u2019 s going to be paying attention to this long-term . Listen , they will make stuff up if they don \u2019 t find something here , \u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) . \u201c I \u2019 ll never vote with my reelection in mind . \u201d\nStill , it \u2019 s been two years since the Senate considered a budget \u2014 and had the accompanying all-nighter \u2014 so lawmakers are licking their chops for a spectacle expected to go into the wee hours Friday .\n\u201c I am thrilled , \u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas . \u201c The chance to let the Senate function and people get amendments that they can get votes on \u2014 that \u2019 s going to be extraordinary . \u201d\n\u201c I hate it more than \u2014 dislike it more than \u2014 any other day in the Senate because we \u2019 re going to be up until 2 a.m. , \u201d grumbled Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) .\nThe budget is nonbinding , yet an important political exercise for Mitch McConnell \u2019 s hopes of a governing majority . The Senate majority leader was still hunting for votes just a day before the final roll call that will come at the tail end of the vote-a-rama , as several Senate Republicans said they were still undecided .\nBut first lawmakers have to survive the voting marathon that could number 100 amendments or more . Here \u2019 s \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s guide to which votes are likely to be remembered long after the Senate \u2019 s late-night session .\nA vote on Iran has repeatedly been put off in the Senate as the Obama administration continued negotiations aimed at curbing Tehran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions . Now , hawkish Republicans can finally force Democrats to go on the record .\nSen. Mark Kirk ( R-Ill. ) is proposing an amendment to the budget that stresses support for imposing a new round of sanctions if Iran reneges on a nuclear agreement .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a way to stop the shift against Israel , \u201d Kirk said Wednesday . He added that he wants to \u201c get a good solid vote , people to say that Israel is our best friend in the region . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether Democrats will bite . Kirk \u2019 s ally on Iran policy and perhaps the most hawkish Senate Democrat \u2014 Bob Menendez of New Jersey \u2014 is staying away from Kirk \u2019 s proposal in the budget fight and prefers to address it when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes up the issue in mid-April . But it all lays the groundwork for the bigger Iran fight that \u2019 s expected next month .\nDemocratic wish list : Pay equity , minimum wage and free college\nSenate Democrats are reviving much of the agenda they used in 2014 to put Republicans in a tough spot on the budget .

Both the House and Senate try to get around the caps imposed by the Budget Control Act by relying on the Overseas Contingency Operations account \u2014 a fund intended for emergency war spending that doesn \u2019 t count against the limits .\nBut some Senate hawks want to go further . Republican Sens . Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas are pushing an amendment that would bring next year \u2019 s defense spending to about $ 697 billion for the next fiscal year with about $ 50 billion of which would be OCO money .

Rob Portman , who is up for reelection in the swing state of Ohio , could get to Washington and introduce his amendment intended to lower the Medicaid costs of caring for children .
