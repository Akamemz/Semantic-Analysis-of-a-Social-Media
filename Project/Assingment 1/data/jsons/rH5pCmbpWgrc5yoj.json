The pandemic could lead to 75,000 additional \u201c deaths of despair , \u201d according to Well Being Trust .\nThis week , COVID-19 deaths topped 93,000 in the United States , far more than the 58,000-plus Americans who died in the Vietnam War . Marginalized and vulnerable populations are bearing the brunt .\nIn California and across the country , pressure is on to reopen , expressed in lawsuits and protests . Over it all looms an election in November . No fewer than a dozen suits have been filed against California and Gov . Gavin Newsom by gun shops , churches , businesses , and even a bride to be .\nMichael Flood feels for America \u2019 s government leaders . They have difficult choices to make in deciding how quickly to reopen economies . As president of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank , he \u2019 s seeing both sides of human hurt in the coronavirus pandemic .\nOn one hand , a lockdown to prevent spread of the virus has caused great economic and mental stress , illustrated in the skyrocketing demand for food pantries in Los Angeles County , the most populous county in the nation . The food bank \u2019 s distribution has surged 80 % since the beginning of March \u2013 nearly twice the increase during the Great Recession . Several times a week , upward of a thousand cars line up at parking lots for drive-through groceries .\nAt the same time , two people who worked at the food bank \u2019 s partners have died from the virus . Los Angeles County is the epicenter for the outbreak in California , with about 2,000 deaths so far . The disease \u201c feels like a personal threat to all of us , \u201d explains Mr . Flood .\n\u201c We \u2019 re seeing on both ends , people who have died from COVID and this huge impact . I really struggle with this . It \u2019 s so hard to figure out . \u201d\nIt is no wonder that Mr . Flood is wrestling with trade-offs in the reopening . Much of the country is entering a \u201c gray space , \u201d as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti puts it . That space lies between flinging open the doors and cautionary measures to prevent a virus resurgence . It includes ethical dimensions as governors and local officials make life-altering choices , while those unhappy with the decisions push back in the courts and on the street . Americans need to have a national conversation about these choices and their consequences , say social scientists . But it \u2019 s a tough subject .\nHans Gutknecht/The Orange County Register/AP Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti , shown at a press conference in Reseda , Calif. , May 19 , 2020 , says the country is entering a \u201c gray space \u201d when it comes to decisionmaking around the coronavirus outbreak .\nAs New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo recently put it , \u201c How much is a human life worth ? That is the real discussion that no one is admitting , openly or freely . \u201d\nThe national narrative on choices surrounding the pandemic is evolving , says Anita Chandra , director of the Rand Corp. \u2019 s research on social and economic well-being . It started with \u201c we \u2019 re all in this together \u201d and \u201c sheltering in place \u201d to save lives and not overwhelm hospitals . Now , with the curve flattening in states like California , Washington , and New York , some people are saying that their personal liberty and other aspects of their well-being are more important .\nBut the conversation needs to advance further , and be more directly addressed , says Dr. Chandra . She puts it plainly , \u201c How much do you weigh different parts of our total well-being against each other ? \u201d It \u2019 s an \u201c uncomfortable \u201d question , she says , but necessary , because it forces moral questions about American values and prepares the country to deal with a possible resurgence of the virus \u2013 and learn from it .\nFor instance , what choices will government leaders make if the nation muddles through a summer of retail and restaurants at half capacity and sees an uptick in the economy \u2013 and then faces a spike of infections ? Many people will want to keep the economic vitality going , while others will worry about contracting the virus .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of fear . Even as we reopen , a lot of people say to me , \u2018 Don \u2019 t reopen . I don \u2019 t want to work . It \u2019 s not safe , \u2019 \u201d says Dr. Barbara Ferrer , director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health .\nThis week , COVID-19 deaths topped 93,000 in the United States , far more than the 58,000 Americans who died in the Vietnam War . Marginalized and vulnerable populations are bearing the brunt .\nAt the same time , isolation and joblessness have their own costs \u2013 among them , mental health , children \u2019 s welfare , and financial ruin . Unemployment stands at 14.7 % , the highest rate since the Great Depression . The pandemic could lead to 75,000 additional \u201c deaths of despair \u201d resulting from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide , according to the Well Being Trust , a national wellness foundation .\nIn trying to prevent COVID deaths , the medical profession is doing exactly what you would expect them to \u2013 save lives , says Dr. Chandra . But that needs to be \u201c balanced against all these other aspects of well-being . \u201d\nGovernments do have a mathematical way to figure a cost-benefit analysis for policies as they relate to risk of a lost life . It \u2019 s called the value of a statistical life , or VSL , and it \u2019 s based on how much individuals themselves are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death . Right now , VSLs range between $ 9 million and $ 11 million per life and are used to determine , for instance , the cost of environmental regulations or road improvements .\nBut some say that \u2019 s too blunt of an instrument to use \u2013 or at least use by itself \u2013 because it \u2019 s rooted in narrow trade-offs that don \u2019 t fit a broad condition like a pandemic . Questions about American values also have to be considered , says Dr. Chandra : \u201c What are the ethics around liberty and freedom of movement ? What are the ethics around whose life is worth more ? And what are the ethics around protecting the most vulnerable ? \u201d\nWellness experts regret that public health and the economy are being pitted against each other . The two are actually inextricably connected and support each other , they say . \u201c The question should be : How do we prevent the most number of people from dying from anything , period , \u201d says Benjamin Miller , chief strategy officer of Well Being Trust .\nGregory Bull/AP Workers at Pigment prepare floral arrangements for curbside service May 19 , 2020 , in San Diego . With encouraging results in their fight against the coronavirus , San Diego County supervisors voted Tuesday to ask the state to be a test case for whether more rapid reopening can safely occur .\n\u201c I think the way the choice is being presented is between saving grandma and saving the economy , and the way we look at it is if we \u2019 re not careful , we \u2019 re going to kill grandma and kill the economy , \u201d says Alex Tabarrok , director of the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia . \u201c These two things are not in opposition to one another . \u201d\nHe co-authored an Op-Ed in The Washington Post arguing that quick , congressional funding of sufficient testing , contact tracing , and quarantining would provide the confidence and safety needed to open up businesses and bring people back to work . This should be combined with \u201c zones \u201d that open at different paces , recognizing that the virus has not hit all regions equally .\nOthers see more federal spending as the way to protect against harm from disease and a decimated economy , pointing to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell \u2019 s remarks that Congress may need to do more in the way of fiscal support . The House passed a $ 3 trillion stimulus bill that would aid state and local governments that faces an uncertain future in the Senate . On the other hand , President Donald Trump is pushing for a speedy reopening , as is his treasury secretary , Steve Mnuchin .\nAnd then there are those who point to American creativity as a bridge to carry the country forward . A case in point : Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services , which provides free mental health , substance abuse , and suicide prevention help .\nThe group completely reoriented its work from on-site only to allow people to work remotely . In a herculean effort , it outfitted its 80 staff and 215 volunteers with laptops and headsets , trained them , and changed the setup for callers to the crisis line .\nThe inflow of calls related to COVID-19 has been huge , and for the first time , caller and counselor have been experiencing many of the same things . The nonprofit had to contend with virus exposure , quarantining staff . Some staff have lost family members , says Carolyn Levitan , the crisis line director .\nOn the other hand , the forced reorientation has opened a whole new way of operating , says Ms. Levitan . \u201c It \u2019 s a huge eye-opener . I \u2019 m really excited about it , \u201d she says . It turns out not everyone wants to endure Los Angeles traffic to volunteer in person , and people have other reasons for wanting to work from home .\nNo matter what state and county officials decide about the pace of reopening , though , her group will take a \u201c thoughtful \u201d approach . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be a very slow return for us , \u201d in part because of people \u2019 s fears about safety , though the center has put social distancing and extra hygiene measures in place .\nCounty leaders are now hoping to open up more fully by July 4 , but they still want to keep a lid on hospitalizations .\n\u201c We do acknowledge there are trade-offs , \u201d says Paul Simon , chief science officer for LA County \u2019 s Department of Public Health . Early on , everyone was focused on locking down the disease , but now health officials are looking closely at other indicators such as suicides ( a lagging indicator that has actually decreased slightly ) .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a tough situation with this pandemic and hard choices are going to have to be made , but I think they can be made in a thoughtful way . \u201d\nIn California and across the country , pressure is on to reopen , expressed in lawsuits and protests . Over it all looms an election in November . No fewer than a dozen suits have been filed against California and Gov . Gavin Newsom by gun shops , churches , businesses , and even a bride to be . Last week , the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the state \u2019 s \u201c safer at home \u201d order , saying it needed approval in the Legislature .\nEugene Volokh , who teaches at the University of California Los Angeles law school , says it is unlikely that it will be the courts that push reopening . Governments have \u201c extremely broad authority \u201d in a pandemic , especially over everyday business , he explains , citing the 1905 Supreme Court smallpox case , Jacobson v. Massachusetts . It may be a little different where some specific individual rights are involved \u2013 such as with churches or guns . Stay-at-home orders also may violate some state constitutions .\nBut it is economic pressure that will do the pushing , he says . \u201c Long before the courts accept any of these business claims , many states are going to recognize that at some point , the shutdown causes more harm than good. \u201d Governors don \u2019 t want to be seen as causing more deaths than the pandemic , he says , and at the same time , they need revenues to implement their programs and balance their budgets .\n\u201c The interests of business , and the interests of citizens , and the interests of government officials , while not completely aligned , will be largely aligned in favor of opening things up as long as it is seen as marginally safe . \u201d\nIndeed , with decreased hospitalizations , Governor Newsom this week relaxed criteria for counties to move further along the road to reopening . LA County officials , too , feel a sense of urgency from businesses to open or risk permanent job loss .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c Time is of the essence , \u201d said Kathryn Barger , chair of the county \u2019 s Board of Supervisors after meeting with business leaders this week . \u201c Now it is time to begin to move from safer at home , to safer at work , and safer in our communities . \u201d",
