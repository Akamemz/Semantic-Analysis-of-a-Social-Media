This is \u201c The Daily . \u201d\nspeaker O.K . Mike ? mike Yeah . speaker I want you to start on page 215 \u2014 \u201c factual results of the obstruction investigation . \u201d\nspeaker Sharon , here \u2019 s what I want you to excerpt . I want you to start on page four . Nick , I want you to start at the bottom of page eight .\nspeaker 1 That quote is new . speaker 2 It \u2019 s a pretty good quote .\nAll right . Mike Schmidt , Mark Mazzetti , it \u2019 s 9:15 on Thursday night . You \u2019 ve both now spent about 10 hours reading the Mueller report . Tell me about this thing .\nIt \u2019 s a breathtaking document . It \u2019 s over 400 pages of detailed insights and accounts of enormous issues we \u2019 ve been focused on over the past two years . It \u2019 s divided into , essentially , two halves \u2014 one for Russia , one for the president \u2019 s actions in office .\nIn other words , collusion and obstruction . Those are the two buckets .\nRight . The first half detailing the contact between Russians and Trump advisers isn \u2019 t enormously revealing , in the sense that we had already heard some weeks ago that there had not been a , quote , \u201c criminal conspiracy \u201d found by Mueller . At the same time , there \u2019 s an enormous amount of detail concluding that in the midst of this really historic effort by the Russians to sabotage the election \u2014 hacking and leaking of emails , social media manipulation , fake news \u2014 it says that the Trump campaign welcomed this . They saw a real benefit of what the Russians were doing , even if at the end of the day there wasn \u2019 t an active conspiracy .\nHe \u2019 s essentially saying that they were interested , they sought out information about emails , they wanted to know more about how they could get their hands on these messages . They welcomed all this , but they never crossed the line into breaking the law . Just because they sought out the fruits of the Russian hack doesn \u2019 t mean that they were part of the crime .\nAnd just to be very clear , how is what you \u2019 re describing , collectively , not collusion ?\nWell , I think we need to be careful , because the attorney general said that there was no collusion . And the president said there was no collusion . But the Mueller report is more nuanced . And the Mueller report says , you know , this \u201c collusion \u201d word doesn \u2019 t really mean anything to us . There \u2019 s no legal standard of collusion . So what we \u2019 re going to look at is what is a crime , and that is conspiracy . And that \u2019 s what we have to judge all of this voluminous evidence against . And they said that a conspiracy is two parties acting together in concert to break the law . And what Mueller is very clear about is that there is , quote , \u201c insufficient evidence \u201d of a conspiracy . He is not saying there was nothing . He is not saying full exoneration . But he \u2019 s saying there is insufficient evidence to meet the standard that he had established of a criminal conspiracy breaking the law .\nAnd what would Mueller have needed to see for this to add up to conspiracy ?\nThat would have looked like a conversation between the Trump campaign and the Russians where the Trump campaign was saying , hey guys , can you go break into the D.N.C . and steal some emails so we can then get them out and embarrass the Democrats and help us politically during the campaign ? That would have gotten you down the conspiracy path . And they did not find that .\nO.K . So let \u2019 s talk about obstruction . Mike , last time we talked , a couple weeks back , Mueller had sent his report to Barr . And Barr had sent a summary of that report to Congress in advance of this full report . And the most confusing thing about that summary was that Mueller had not made a call on whether the evidence added up to obstruction of justice .\nAnd today , we get to see what Mueller \u2019 s explanation is for why he didn \u2019 t make a determination on whether the president broke the law . And it \u2019 s not clear-cut . What it essentially is is that the president , under Justice Department policy , can not be indicted . And because the president can not be indicted , it \u2019 s unfair to accuse him while he \u2019 s in office of breaking the law , because there \u2019 s no way for him to go to court to defend himself . So , dear American public , Mueller essentially says , I am not going to make a determination on that issue . That could be made after the president leaves office . But for now , that would be unfair . So what I will do is I will lay out for you what I found , what the potential obstruction was , why it may be illegal . And after the president leaves office , the Justice Department could make a determination that he indeed broke the law and bring a case . And at the end of explaining why a determination was not made , Mueller says , if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice , we would so state . Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards , however , we are unable to reach that judgment . So Mueller is basically saying , if we felt comfortable that the president had done nothing wrong , we would tell you . And we are not telling you that .\nWell , Mike , you mentioned the incidents that he was not going to use as a basis for charging the president , because he felt he couldn \u2019 t charge the president . What were those that he laid out in the report ?\nWell , there \u2019 s about a dozen . And they follow in chronological order how Trump misled the public about his relationship with Russia , misled the public about his knowledge that Russia was behind the hacks . And as the presidency goes on and Mueller is appointed in May of 2017 , right after he takes office , the president starts to sort of lose his grip as he tries to maintain control of the investigation . He was intent on using his power as the head of the executive branch to protect himself and use the tools at his disposal \u2014 the people running the Justice Department , the F.B.I. , the intelligence community \u2014 to help protect him from this investigation .\nWell , a lot of them are ones that we know well . The firing of James Comey . His efforts to get his attorney general , Jeff Sessions , to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation , essentially reassert his control over something that he has stepped aside from because he has a conflict of interest . And when the president can \u2019 t get that done , he basically tries to get rid of Sessions and install a loyalist atop the Justice Department . These are things that had been reported in the press . We get a fuller , richer picture of them . And we really see what the president was saying behind closed doors and the immense pressure he was putting on people to try and use the system to protect himself from the system . But then we learn about incidents that we knew little about , like how the president went completely outside of his administration in government to Corey Lewandowski , his first campaign manager .\nAnd he leaned on Corey in the summer of 2017 to try and pressure Sessions , his attorney general . So here \u2019 s the president of the United States using someone who doesn \u2019 t even work for him to get to Sessions and try and get Sessions out there publicly to help clear Trump \u2019 s name . It \u2019 s just a remarkable way of using presidential power .\nWhich suggests that the president was meeting resistance within his own administration , and therefore reached out to somebody who didn \u2019 t even work for the government to try to get him to achieve this end .\nI don \u2019 t think many in the public will want to hold up the president \u2019 s aides as heroes , and a lot of them are probably not . But there is a picture here of folks that stopped the president time and time again and thwarted him from doing things that may have actually gotten him into trouble , that may have crossed that line , that may have made a stronger argument for Mueller about why the president did obstruct justice . One of the most detailed ones is on Trump \u2019 s efforts to get rid of Mueller and how his White House counsel would not do that . He would not call the Justice Department on the president \u2019 s behalf and say Mueller has to be removed for what the White House counsel , Don McGahn , thought were some bogus reasons Trump had cooked up about why he didn \u2019 t like Mueller . And in the document , as Mueller is recounting what happened in this incident , there are Nixonian echoes . It says , on June 17 , 2017 , the president called McGahn at home and directed him to call the acting attorney general and say that the special counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed . McGahn did not carry out the direction , however , deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential \u201c Saturday Night Massacre \u201d \u2014 a reference to when Richard Nixon fired the special counsel who was investigating him .\nI recognize that this question is a little bit meta , but if getting rid of Mueller had meant that the report was never completed , wouldn \u2019 t that have finally been obstruction of justice ? Because , literally , an investigation was obstructed .\nThere does seem to be a determination here about the success of the president \u2019 s efforts , or lack of success \u2014 that the fact that the Mueller investigation continued and finished means there is less of a case that the president obstructed justice . If there had been more of a Nixonian moment , where there was an 18-minute gap in tapes that were deliberately erased , that there was some tangible thing that had happened that had meant that prosecutors couldn \u2019 t get to the truth , there might possibly have been a different judgment and a different outcome .\nRight . I keep thinking of that 18-minute deletion when I think about Don McGahn . It \u2019 s as if nobody had ever said to Nixon what Don McGahn had said to President Trump \u2014 no , I \u2019 m not going to delete that tape . Sorry . But that \u2019 s what Don McGahn did to the president . That \u2019 s what happened with Trump over and over again .\nBecause everyone has seen \u201c All the President \u2019 s Men , \u201d and they know what happens . And , you know , you don \u2019 t want to be the guy who carries out the \u201c Saturday Night Massacre . \u201d\nSo the president really has these people around him to thank , in a lot of ways .\nAt the end of the day , there were these folks that were not going to go that extra inch and go over the line for him . And it looks like those measures probably saved him .\nI mean , Mueller lays this point out explicitly . This is a quote from the report . \u201c The president \u2019 s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful . But that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or cede to his requests . Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn , which ultimately resulted in Flynn \u2019 s prosecution and conviction for lying to the F.B.I . McGahn did not tell the acting attorney general that the special counsel must be removed , but was instead prepared to resign over the president \u2019 s order . Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the president \u2019 s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russian investigation to future election meddling only . And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the president \u2019 s direction to have the special counsel removed , despite the president \u2019 s multiple demands to do so . \u201d\nHmm . And Mike , before seeing this report , our understanding of why Mueller may not have reached a conclusion on obstruction of justice was that obstruction has a lot to do with intent . Why did the president take the actions that he took ? What did we learn from the report about how Mueller might have been thinking about that ?\nWe learn that the president was intent on ending the investigation into himself , but it \u2019 s less clear about what was truly motivating him .\nI guess I don \u2019 t quite understand that . If his intent is to end the investigation , how is that not obstruction of justice ?\nIt \u2019 s a clash of two theories . I mean , Mueller \u2019 s team clearly indicated that the actions come up to the line of obstruction of justice \u2014 that the intent to end the investigation to preserve his presidency does , in fact , approach something that is criminal obstruction of justice , even if they did not make that determination . The rub here is that it is at odds with the theory of Robert Mueller \u2019 s boss , Attorney General Barr . He got the job of attorney general , some say , based on his theory that the president can \u2019 t really obstruct justice . Barr says , today , in his press conference \u2014\narchived recording ( william barr ) President Trump faced an unprecedented situation . As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president , federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office .\nAt the heart of a obstruction of justice investigation is whether that person has corrupt intent . And his determination is that the president didn \u2019 t . And in a way , this big debate over the intent of the president \u2014 Barr kind of goes out of his way today to fill in the blanks , to sort of say , well , let \u2019 s look at the president \u2019 s intent .\narchived recording ( william barr ) At the same time , there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president \u2019 s personal culpability . Yet , as he said from the beginning , there was , in fact , no collusion .\narchived recording ( william barr ) There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency , propelled by his political opponents , and fueled by illegal leaks . Nonetheless , the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel \u2019 s investigation .\nYeah . He wanted this thing over . So in a way , what was one of the things that was so extraordinary about Barr \u2019 s press conference was that he explains the president \u2019 s reasoning in a way that the president hasn \u2019 t himself .\nSo Barr would say that trying to end the investigation to protect the presidency is not corrupt motive . In fact , in his telling , it \u2019 s arguably even important , maybe even a little bit noble . It \u2019 s in the best interest of the American people .\nSo there \u2019 s this totally compelling moment in the middle of the report that paints a scene of the president being told that a special counsel had just been appointed . And I \u2019 ll quote directly from the report . \u201c The president slumped back in his chair and said , \u2018 Oh , my God . This is terrible . This is the end of my presidency . I \u2019 m fucked. \u2019 The president became angry and lambasted the attorney general for his decision to recuse from the investigation , stating , \u2018 How could you let this happen , Jeff ? \u2019 The president said the position of attorney general was his most important appointment , and that Sessions had , quote , \u2018 let him down , \u2019 contrasting him with Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy . Sessions recalled that the president said to him , \u2018 You were supposed to protect me , \u2019 or words to that effect . The president returned to the consequences of the appointment and said , \u2018 Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels , it ruins your presidency . It takes years and years , and I won \u2019 t be able to do anything . This is the worst thing that ever happened to me. \u2019 \u201d The way this passage reads is the president \u2019 s anger about the appointment of a special counsel comes mostly from the recognition that it \u2019 s going to imperil his presidency . It means nothing will get done . It means that he \u2019 s going to spend the rest of his term fighting it . It \u2019 s not because he \u2019 s worried that Robert Mueller might find something that will one day land Donald Trump in jail . That \u2019 s one reading of this passage that would bolster the argument made by the attorney general that the president faced this extraordinary situation .\nI don \u2019 t think that makes any sense . Or at least I don \u2019 t understand it . I don \u2019 t understand how the attorney general can say there \u2019 s no issue of an underlying crime here when Donald Trump is sitting there acknowledging the potential threat from the depth and breadth of a special counsel \u2019 s investigation . He knew at that point , in May of 2017 , that he had had his personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , make hush money payments to women . Donald Trump was smart enough to know that a special counsel \u2014 like in Bill Clinton or any other presidency \u2014 rummages around on one issue and ends up on another . And what happens ? Mueller finds these weird transactions . He refers it to another U.S. attorney \u2019 s office . And the president is ultimately in a completely separate investigation , named as an unindicted co-conspirator .\nHow is there not an underlying crime that Donald Trump was afraid about ? In July of 2017 , myself and two colleagues go into the Oval Office to interview the president . He says , if Mueller looks at my finances , it \u2019 s crossing a red line . So what were Trump \u2019 s motivations for getting rid of Mueller ? Was he really worried about Russia ? Or was he worried that , hey , if this guy rummages around on Russia , he \u2019 s going to find something else ? Indeed , he did .\nSo Mike , you \u2019 re saying that Barr \u2019 s argument \u2014 that the president is just protecting the presidency \u2014 doesn \u2019 t really hold up . Because we know for a fact that the president understood , at this point , that when he says , I \u2019 m effed , that he has these payments made in coordination with Michael Cohen to these women as hush money , which have nothing to do with the Russia investigation , but which obviously could be incredibly damaging to him , and maybe even criminal .\nLook , no one has questioned the president about this in a law enforcement setting . I don \u2019 t know exactly what the president \u2019 s intentions were , but the idea that there was no underlying criminality in Donald Trump \u2019 s life in May of 2017 , when Mueller got appointed , is bogus . Because there was . Further , in December of 2017 , there is a report out there that Mueller has subpoenaed the president \u2019 s bank records .\nBefore the president \u2019 s lawyers are able to get the message to him that the report is wrong , he starts telling White House aides that Mueller has to go .\nI do think there \u2019 s a decent case to be made that there were underlying issues of criminality within his life . The Justice Department has said that itself .\nO.K . So regardless of the president \u2019 s intent , is it important whether or not he was successful in impeding this investigation , in thinking about the question of obstruction of justice ?\nWell , I think for the folks at the Justice Department who had to make the call about whether the president broke the law , one of the factors that played into their declination decision was the fact that when you looked at the investigation , the efforts that the president took did not significantly damage the inquiry .\nDespite the president \u2019 s best efforts , he was not very good at obstructing justice .\nRight . The existence of the Mueller report today suggests that the investigation did not get obstructed .\nDespite all of Donald Trump \u2019 s huffing and puffing and trying to get this person to do this and this person to do that , Bob Mueller moved ahead unimpeded for two years , finished his investigation , and the entire country got to see the fruits of it . Show us where the obstruction is , is what the president \u2019 s defenders would say .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So finally , I want to talk about Bill Barr \u2019 s role in all this . Because the position of many Democrats today was that Barr \u2014 in reaching a decision on obstruction of justice where Mueller did not , in holding a press conference ahead of the report \u2019 s release seeming to defend the president , all taken together \u2014 has undermined any credibility that he had , and that Democrats and the country need to see for themselves what Mueller had found . How are you thinking about Barr in this moment , having now spent time with the Mueller report ?\nI mean , the one thing is clear is that this has been a lot of red meat for Democrats in Congress to keep investigating . And one of the things that they \u2019 re going to keep investigating is Barr \u2019 s role in this entire process . They are going to try to get him up to testify . They are going to try to get more underlying documents in the Mueller investigation . They now see Barr as a clear target for them . I think a lot of people , because of all these actions , have a much different picture of the attorney general than they did a month or two ago .\nAnd they \u2019 re going to try to understand the differences between what Bob Mueller thinks about all this \u2014 the supposedly nonpartisan figure \u2014 and what Bill Barr thinks about this \u2014 the presidential appointee whose allegiances are clearly closer to the president .\nThere \u2019 s one answer to this . And that is that after this entire investigation in which Bob Mueller has said nothing publicly , including today , when there was a press conference held to talk about his report , we need to hear from Bob Mueller . We need for him to explain to us more how they came to this determination that they couldn \u2019 t say whether the president violated the law or not . Does Mueller think that Barr has misrepresented some of his findings ? What was his relationship with the Justice Department ? Did he believe that Congress should deal with this issue and that Barr shouldn \u2019 t have made a call on whether the president violated the law ? We need to hear from Mueller . We have never heard his voice in the past two years .\nSo inadvertently , in seeming to protect the president and not be representing Mueller , Bill Barr may be extending Democrats \u2019 interest in this investigation and the trouble for the president .\nAbsolutely . If you look back at what Barr has done in the last month , this could have turned out differently for him \u2014 if he had put out the report immediately after the letter or as soon after the letter as he could have , if he had characterized the report differently in that four-page letter , and if he hadn \u2019 t had a press conference on the day of the release before anyone had seen the report that had this appearance of trying to spin it for the president and protect the president . That seems to have created more problems both for Barr and the president than if they had just released the report .\nMark , thank you very much . Mike , thank you very much .",

Mike, last time we talked, a couple weeks back, Mueller had sent his report to Barr. And Barr had sent a summary of that report to Congress in advance of this full report. And the most confusing thing about that summary was that Mueller had not made a call on whether the evidence added up to obstruction of justice.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAnd today, we get to see what Mueller\u2019s explanation is for why he didn\u2019t make a determination on whether the president broke the law.

The firing of James Comey. His efforts to get his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation, essentially reassert his control over something that he has stepped aside from because he has a conflict of interest. And when the president can\u2019t get that done, he basically tries to get rid of Sessions and install a loyalist atop the Justice Department. These are things that had been reported in the press. We get a fuller, richer picture of them. And we really see what the president was saying behind closed doors and the immense pressure he was putting on people to try and use the system to protect himself from the system. But then we learn about incidents that we knew little about, like how the president went completely outside of his administration in government to Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAnd he leaned on Corey in the summer of 2017 to try and pressure Sessions, his attorney general. So here\u2019s the president of the United States using someone who doesn\u2019t even work for him to get to Sessions and try and get Sessions out there publicly to help clear Trump\u2019s name. It\u2019s just a remarkable way of using presidential power.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich suggests that the president was meeting resistance within his own administration, and therefore reached out to somebody who didn\u2019t even work for the government to try to get him to achieve this end.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI don\u2019t think many in the public will want to hold up the president\u2019s aides as heroes, and a lot of them are probably not. But there is a picture here of folks that stopped the president time and time again and thwarted him from doing things that may have actually gotten him into trouble, that may have crossed that line, that may have made a stronger argument for Mueller about why the president did obstruct justice. One of the most detailed ones is on Trump\u2019s efforts to get rid of Mueller and how his White House counsel would not do that. He would not call the Justice Department on the president\u2019s behalf and say Mueller has to be removed for what the White House counsel, Don McGahn, thought were some bogus reasons Trump had cooked up about why he didn\u2019t like Mueller. And in the document, as Mueller is recounting what happened in this incident, there are Nixonian echoes. It says, on June 17, 2017, the president called McGahn at home and directed him to call the acting attorney general and say that the special counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d \u2014 a reference to when Richard Nixon fired the special counsel who was investigating him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI recognize that this question is a little bit meta, but if getting rid of Mueller had meant that the report was never completed, wouldn\u2019t that have finally been obstruction of justice? Because, literally, an investigation was obstructed.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThere does seem to be a determination here about the success of the president\u2019s efforts, or lack of success \u2014 that the fact that the Mueller investigation continued and finished means there is less of a case that the president obstructed justice. If there had been more of a Nixonian moment, where there was an 18-minute gap in tapes that were deliberately erased, that there was some tangible thing that had happened that had meant that prosecutors couldn\u2019t get to the truth, there might possibly have been a different judgment and a different outcome.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I keep thinking of that 18-minute deletion when I think about Don McGahn. It\u2019s as if nobody had ever said to Nixon what Don McGahn had said to President Trump \u2014 no, I\u2019m not going to delete that tape. Sorry. But that\u2019s what Don McGahn did to the president. That\u2019s what happened with Trump over and over again.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBecause everyone has seen \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d and they know what happens. And, you know, you don\u2019t want to be the guy who carries out the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre.\u201d\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the president really has these people around him to thank, in a lot of ways.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nAt the end of the day, there were these folks that were not going to go that extra inch and go over the line for him. And it looks like those measures probably saved him.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nI mean, Mueller lays this point out explicitly. This is a quote from the report. \u201cThe president\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful. But that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or cede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn\u2019s prosecution and conviction for lying to the F.B.I. McGahn did not tell the acting attorney general that the special counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the president\u2019s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the president\u2019s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russian investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the president\u2019s direction to have the special counsel removed, despite the president\u2019s multiple demands to do so.\u201d\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. And Mike, before seeing this report, our understanding of why Mueller may not have reached a conclusion on obstruction of justice was that obstruction has a lot to do with intent. Why did the president take the actions that he took? What did we learn from the report about how Mueller might have been thinking about that?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWe learn that the president was intent on ending the investigation into himself, but it\u2019s less clear about what was truly motivating him.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI guess I don\u2019t quite understand that. If his intent is to end the investigation, how is that not obstruction of justice?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThis is the heart of this dispute right now.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nYeah.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIt\u2019s a clash of two theories. I mean, Mueller\u2019s team clearly indicated that the actions come up to the line of obstruction of justice \u2014 that the intent to end the investigation to preserve his presidency does, in fact, approach something that is criminal obstruction of justice, even if they did not make that determination. The rub here is that it is at odds with the theory of Robert Mueller\u2019s boss, Attorney General Barr. He got the job of attorney general, some say, based on his theory that the president can\u2019t really obstruct justice. Barr says, today, in his press conference \u2014\n\narchived recording (william barr) President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAt the heart of a obstruction of justice investigation is whether that person has corrupt intent. And his determination is that the president didn\u2019t. And in a way, this big debate over the intent of the president \u2014 Barr kind of goes out of his way today to fill in the blanks, to sort of say, well, let\u2019s look at the president\u2019s intent.\n\narchived recording (william barr) At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president\u2019s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThe president felt that this was consuming his presidency.\n\narchived recording (william barr) There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYeah. He wanted this thing over. So in a way, what was one of the things that was so extraordinary about Barr\u2019s press conference was that he explains the president\u2019s reasoning in a way that the president hasn\u2019t himself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Barr would say that trying to end the investigation to protect the presidency is not corrupt motive. In fact, in his telling, it\u2019s arguably even important, maybe even a little bit noble. It\u2019s in the best interest of the American people.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nPerhaps patriotic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nSo there\u2019s this totally compelling moment in the middle of the report that paints a scene of the president being told that a special counsel had just been appointed. And I\u2019ll quote directly from the report. \u201cThe president slumped back in his chair and said, \u2018Oh, my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m fucked.\u2019 The president became angry and lambasted the attorney general for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, \u2018How could you let this happen, Jeff?\u2019 The president said the position of attorney general was his most important appointment, and that Sessions had, quote, \u2018let him down,\u2019 contrasting him with Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the president said to him, \u2018You were supposed to protect me,\u2019 or words to that effect. The president returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, \u2018Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years, and I won\u2019t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u2019\u201d The way this passage reads is the president\u2019s anger about the appointment of a special counsel comes mostly from the recognition that it\u2019s going to imperil his presidency. It means nothing will get done. It means that he\u2019s going to spend the rest of his term fighting it. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s worried that Robert Mueller might find something that will one day land Donald Trump in jail. That\u2019s one reading of this passage that would bolster the argument made by the attorney general that the president faced this extraordinary situation.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI don\u2019t think that makes any sense. Or at least I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand how the attorney general can say there\u2019s no issue of an underlying crime here when Donald Trump is sitting there acknowledging the potential threat from the depth and breadth of a special counsel\u2019s investigation. He knew at that point, in May of 2017, that he had had his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, make hush money payments to women. Donald Trump was smart enough to know that a special counsel \u2014 like in Bill Clinton or any other presidency \u2014 rummages around on one issue and ends up on another. And what happens? Mueller finds these weird transactions. He refers it to another U.S. attorney\u2019s office. And the president is ultimately in a completely separate investigation, named as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nHow is there not an underlying crime that Donald Trump was afraid about? In July of 2017, myself and two colleagues go into the Oval Office to interview the president. He says, if Mueller looks at my finances, it\u2019s crossing a red line. So what were Trump\u2019s motivations for getting rid of Mueller? Was he really worried about Russia? Or was he worried that, hey, if this guy rummages around on Russia, he\u2019s going to find something else? Indeed, he did.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mike, you\u2019re saying that Barr\u2019s argument \u2014 that the president is just protecting the presidency \u2014 doesn\u2019t really hold up. Because we know for a fact that the president understood, at this point, that when he says, I\u2019m effed, that he has these payments made in coordination with Michael Cohen to these women as hush money, which have nothing to do with the Russia investigation, but which obviously could be incredibly damaging to him, and maybe even criminal.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nLook, no one has questioned the president about this in a law enforcement setting. I don\u2019t know exactly what the president\u2019s intentions were, but the idea that there was no underlying criminality in Donald Trump\u2019s life in May of 2017, when Mueller got appointed, is bogus. Because there was. Further, in December of 2017, there is a report out there that Mueller has subpoenaed the president\u2019s bank records.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nBefore the president\u2019s lawyers are able to get the message to him that the report is wrong, he starts telling White House aides that Mueller has to go.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nI do think there\u2019s a decent case to be made that there were underlying issues of criminality within his life. The Justice Department has said that itself.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K. So regardless of the president\u2019s intent, is it important whether or not he was successful in impeding this investigation, in thinking about the question of obstruction of justice?\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nWell, I think for the folks at the Justice Department who had to make the call about whether the president broke the law, one of the factors that played into their declination decision was the fact that when you looked at the investigation, the efforts that the president took did not significantly damage the inquiry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nDespite the president\u2019s best efforts, he was not very good at obstructing justice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. The existence of the Mueller report today suggests that the investigation did not get obstructed.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nDespite all of Donald Trump\u2019s huffing and puffing and trying to get this person to do this and this person to do that, Bob Mueller moved ahead unimpeded for two years, finished his investigation, and the entire country got to see the fruits of it. Show us where the obstruction is, is what the president\u2019s defenders would say.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So finally, I want to talk about Bill Barr\u2019s role in all this. Because the position of many Democrats today was that Barr \u2014 in reaching a decision on obstruction of justice where Mueller did not, in holding a press conference ahead of the report\u2019s release seeming to defend the president, all taken together \u2014 has undermined any credibility that he had, and that Democrats and the country need to see for themselves what Mueller had found. How are you thinking about Barr in this moment, having now spent time with the Mueller report?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nI mean, the one thing is clear is that this has been a lot of red meat for Democrats in Congress to keep investigating. And one of the things that they\u2019re going to keep investigating is Barr\u2019s role in this entire process. They are going to try to get him up to testify. They are going to try to get more underlying documents in the Mueller investigation. They now see Barr as a clear target for them. I think a lot of people, because of all these actions, have a much different picture of the attorney general than they did a month or two ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd they\u2019re going to try to understand the differences between what Bob Mueller thinks about all this \u2014 the supposedly nonpartisan figure \u2014 and what Bill Barr thinks about this \u2014 the presidential appointee whose allegiances are clearly closer to the president.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nThere\u2019s one answer to this. And that is that after this entire investigation in which Bob Mueller has said nothing publicly, including today, when there was a press conference held to talk about his report, we need to hear from Bob Mueller. We need for him to explain to us more how they came to this determination that they couldn\u2019t say whether the president violated the law or not. Does Mueller think that Barr has misrepresented some of his findings? What was his relationship with the Justice Department? Did he believe that Congress should deal with this issue and that Barr shouldn\u2019t have made a call on whether the president violated the law? We need to hear from Mueller. We have never heard his voice in the past two years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo inadvertently, in seeming to protect the president and not be representing Mueller, Bill Barr may be extending Democrats\u2019 interest in this investigation and the trouble for the president.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAbsolutely. If you look back at what Barr has done in the last month, this could have turned out differently for him \u2014 if he had put out the report immediately after the letter or as soon after the letter as he could have, if he had characterized the report differently in that four-page letter, and if he hadn\u2019t had a press conference on the day of the release before anyone had seen the report that had this appearance of trying to spin it for the president and protect the president. That seems to have created more problems both for Barr and the president than if they had just released the report.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much. Mike, thank you very much.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael schmidt\n\nThanks for having us.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro",
