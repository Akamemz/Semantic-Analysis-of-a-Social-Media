    "content": "In recent weeks Donald Trump has offered one provocative foreign-policy pronouncement after another , reflecting his view that America can no longer afford to pay for the world \u2019 s security and prosperity .\nThe United States , he says , should leave a NATO alliance where wealthy Europeans are mooching off a \u201c poor \u201d US for their national defense needs . Asian partners also need to prepare for an era of American retrenchment \u2013 to the extent that allies Japan and South Korea might want to acquire their own nuclear weapons , he suggests .\nAnd then , of course , there \u2019 s the matter of his envisioned southern border wall \u2013 which he says Mexico must either pay for or face a cutoff of the billions of dollars that Mexicans working in the US send back home each year .\nSuch proposals may leave most of Washington \u2019 s foreign-policy elite gasping for breath , but they resonate with a significant slice of the American public for a couple of key reasons , national security and opinion experts say .\nFor one thing , many in the US have tired of America \u2019 s role of superpower and sympathize with the idea that playing the world \u2019 s policeman has gotten too expensive and offers diminishing returns . Then there \u2019 s the fact that much of Mr. Trump \u2019 s more extreme thinking on US relations with the world has been around in milder forms for years \u2013 and has even picked up steam under President Obama .\nFor instance , former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates caused a stir when he used his farewell tour of Europe in 2011 to castigate European allies for not paying their fair share of the alliance defense bill . And Mr. Obama , elected as a kind of antidote to the interventionist George W. Bush , has as president espoused a more domestically focused America .
