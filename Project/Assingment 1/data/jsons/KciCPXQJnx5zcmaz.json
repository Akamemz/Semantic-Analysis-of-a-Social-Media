Foreign Policy reports of a renewed bombing campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) in Yemen following a late January raid the Trump administration insisted was a holdover from the Obama administration . According to Foreign Policy , the Obama administration `` handed over plans for a stepped-up campaign to the incoming Trump team in January '' and that there 'd been `` an immediate change in the tempo of operations .
