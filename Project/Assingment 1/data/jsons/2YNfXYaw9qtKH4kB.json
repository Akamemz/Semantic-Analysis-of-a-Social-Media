Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) recommended usingantitrust laws to curb the \u201c massive power \u201d of Facebook and other technology companies during a Tuesday interview with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Tonight .\nPollak asked Cruz about possible solutions to \u201c censorship of conservatives \u201d on Facebook and across the broader internet landscape .\nCruz described technology companies \u2019 growing control over the flow of information as a threat to democratic processes . He said , \u201c I think , number one , the growing power of tech to censor speech is a profound threat . We \u2019 re seeing now some two-thirds of Americans are getting their news through social media , and these tech companies are hard-left . They are are partisan Democrats , and what we \u2019 re seeing is they \u2019 re amplifying the views they agree with , those of liberal Democrats , and they are suppressing the views of conservatives . They are blocking conservatives . \u201d\nCruz added , \u201c The scope of the power is truly unprecedented . You think back to the heights of yellow journalism , when publisher William Randolph Hearst controlled much of media and in fact got America into the Spanish-American War . These tech companies have power William Randolph Hearst could never have imagined . The ability , if there \u2019 s a view they dislike , simply to silence it so that if you put a post out there , if you put a tweet out there , it simply goes into the void , into oblivion , and no one sees it . Likewise , they have the ability , if there are views they want to promote , to just have everything on your feed be the views they want to promote . That is invidious . It is invisible , and it is profoundly dangerous . \u201d\nCruz considered exposing technology firms to libel lawsuits to curb their political manipulation of the availability of information on their platforms . He said , \u201c Now your question is a hard one and a good one . What remedies are there ? I would say there are principally two . Number one , the question I asked Mark Zuckerberg , the opening question was , \u2018 Does Facebook consider itself a neutral public form ? \u2019 He danced around and refused to answer that . The reason the question matters is much , is under current law , Facebook and other tech companies have immunity from liability , so if someone posts something on their site , they can \u2019 t be sued for it , and it \u2019 s under what \u2019 s called the Communications Decency Act , section 230 . The entire reason Congress enacted section 230 was under the assumption these tech sites would be neutral public forums , [ that ] they would allow people to be speaking . So the reasoning was , we \u2019 ll protect you from being sued because it \u2019 s not you speaking , it \u2019 s somebody else . Well , if Facebook and the other tech companies are going to choose instead to be partisan political speakers , they have a right to do that . They \u2019 ve got a First Amendment to become and to be partisan political speakers , but there \u2019 s no reason on Earth they should get a special immunity from liability from Congress . \u201d\nCruz continued , \u201c Breitbart , if y \u2019 all go on the radio and say something that \u2019 s slanderous , you can be sued . If the New York Times prints something that is libel , they can be sued . So why on Earth should Facebook get a special immunity from liability that nobody else does .
