And it matches up well with the one she 'll use this week to take a new test linked to the Common Core standards .\nStill , the perky 11-year-old worries . During a recent practice exam at her school in Ohio , she could n't even log on . `` It would n't let me , '' she said . `` It kept saying it was n't right , and it just kept loading the whole time . ''\nHer state on Tuesday will be the first to administer one of two tests in English language arts and math based on the Common Core standards developed by two separate groups of states . By the end of the school year , about 12 million children in 29 states and the District of Columbia will take them , using computers or electronic tablets .\nThe exams are expected to be more difficult than the traditional spring standardized state exams they replace . In some states , they 'll require hours of additional testing time because students will have to do more than just fill in the bubble . The goal is to test students on critical thinking skills , requiring them to describe their reasoning and solve problems .\nThe tests have multimedia components , written essays , and multi-step calculations needed to solve math problems that go beyond just using rote memory . Students in some states will take adaptive versions in which questions get harder or easier depending on their answers .\nThe tests have been caught up in the debate playing out in state legislatures across the country about the federal role in education . Although more than 40 states have adopted Common Core , which spells out what reading and math skills students should master in each grade , several have decided not to offer the tests - known as the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium , and Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers , or PARCC . Some states are introducing other new state standardized tests this year .\nThe Common Core tests fulfill the requirement in the federal No Child Left Behind law for annual testing in reading and math in grades three to eight and again in high school . But as Congress seeks to rewrite the education law , there 's debate over whether the tests should be required by Washington , and whether students are being tested too much . Parents in pockets of the country have joined a movement to `` opt out '' of these standardized tests .\nQuestions also have been raised about students ' keyboarding skills and schools ' computer capacities .\nIn the Appalachian foothills where Kayla attends Morgan South Elementary School , administrators and teachers worry that they do n't have the bandwidth to provide reliable Internet connectivity on testing day . Both tests offer a paper option . PARCC officials anticipate that about a quarter of students will use the paper version ; Smarter Balanced officials estimate roughly 10 to 20 percent will take it on paper .\nJust eight days before the test , the Morgan Local School District in rural southeastern Ohio ordered 200 more Chromebooks , which worked best during the practice run .\nThe week before the test , Kayla and her classmates huddled in pairs sharing what devices were available at the school . `` They 'll be more comfortable with the technology , but it is a worry of mine that , as far as the content that 's on it , there 's still stuff I could be doing to prepare for the test , '' says their teacher , Carrie Young .\nEleven-year-old Colton Kidd says the screens on the Chromebooks are too small . Classmate Josie Jackson , 12 , prefers pencil and paper . But Liam Montgomery likes computerized tests : `` It 's easier to get the answers down , because I do n't have to flip back and forth . ''\nIn some places , school administrators and state leaders are only grudgingly moving forward .\nReferencing federal law , Illinois State Board of Education officials threatened to withhold funds from any district that did n't administer the PARCC exam . Chicago Public Schools officials cited technology concerns in announcing they wo n't give the exam in a majority of its schools .\nTrisha Kocanda , superintendent of the Winnetka Public Schools in Illinois , told parents that she 's concerned about the length of the tests and the `` excessive rigor .
