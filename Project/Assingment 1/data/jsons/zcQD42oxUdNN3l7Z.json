    "content": "The war on coal is not just political rhetoric , or a paranoid fantasy concocted by rapacious polluters . It \u2019 s real and it \u2019 s relentless . Over the past five years , it has killed a coal-fired power plant every 10 days . It has quietly transformed the U.S. electric grid and the global climate debate .\nThe industry and its supporters use \u201c war on coal \u201d as shorthand for a ferocious assault by a hostile White House , but the real war on coal is not primarily an Obama war , or even a Washington war . It \u2019 s a guerrilla war . The front lines are not at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Supreme Court . If you want to see how the fossil fuel that once powered most of the country is being battered by enemy forces , you have to watch state and local hearings where utility commissions and other obscure governing bodies debate individual coal plants . You probably won \u2019 t find much drama . You \u2019 ll definitely find lawyers from the Sierra Club \u2019 s Beyond Coal campaign , the boots on the ground in the war on coal .\nBeyond Coal is the most extensive , expensive and effective campaign in the Club \u2019 s 123-year history , and maybe the history of the environmental movement . It \u2019 s gone largely unnoticed amid the furor over the Keystone pipeline and President Barack Obama \u2019 s efforts to regulate carbon , but it \u2019 s helped retire more than one third of America \u2019 s coal plants since its launch in 2010 , one dull hearing at a time . With a vast war chest donated by Michael Bloomberg , unlikely allies from the business world , and a strategy that relies more on economics than ecology , its team of nearly 200 litigators and organizers has won battles in the Midwestern and Appalachian coal belts , in the reddest of red states , in almost every state that burns coal .\n\u201c They \u2019 re sophisticated , they \u2019 re very active , and they \u2019 re better funded than we are , \u201d says Mike Duncan , a former Republican National Committee chairman who now heads the industry-backed American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity . \u201c I don \u2019 t like what they \u2019 re doing ; we \u2019 re losing a lot of coal in this country . But they do show up . \u201d\nCoal still helps keep our lights on , generating nearly 40 percent of U.S. power . But it generated more than 50 percent just over a decade ago , and the big question now is how rapidly its decline will continue . Almost every watt of new generating capacity is coming from natural gas , wind or solar ; the coal industry now employs fewer workers than the solar industry , which barely existed in 2010 . Utilities no longer even bother to propose new coal plants to replace the old ones they retire . Coal industry stocks are tanking , and analysts are predicting a new wave of coal bankruptcies .\nThis is a big deal , because coal is America \u2019 s top source of greenhouse gases , and coal retirements are the main reason U.S. carbon emissions have declined 10 percent in a decade . Coal is also America \u2019 s top source of mercury , sulfur dioxide and other toxic air pollutants , so fewer coal plants also means less asthma and lung disease\u2014not to mention fewer coal-ash spills and coal-mining disasters . The shift toward cleaner-burning gas and zero-emissions renewables is the most important change in our electricity mix in decades , and while Obama has been an ally in the war on coal\u2014not always as aggressive an ally as the industry claims\u2014the Sierra Club is in the trenches . The U.S. had 523 coal-fired power plants when Beyond Coal began targeting them ; just last week , it celebrated the 190th retirement of its campaign in Asheville , N.C. , culminating a three-year fight that had been featured in the climate documentary \u201c Years of Living Dangerously . \u201d\nBeyond Coal isn \u2019 t the stereotypical Sierra Club campaign , tree-huggers shouting save-the-Earth slogans . Yes , it sometimes deploys its 2.4 million-member , grass-roots army to shutter plants with traditional not-in-my-back-yard organizing and right-to-breathe agitating . But it usually wins by arguing that ditching coal will save ratepayers money .\nBloomberg has donated to the Sierra Club 's vast war chest . | Getty | Getty | Getty\nBehind that argument lies a revolution in the economics of power , changes few Americans think about when they flick their switches . Coal used to be the cheapest form of electricity by far , but it \u2019 s gotten pricier as it \u2019 s been forced to clean up more of its mess , while the costs of gas , wind and solar have plunged in recent years . Now retrofitting old coal plants with the pollution controls needed to comply with Obama \u2019 s limits on soot , sulfur and mercury is becoming cost-prohibitive\u2014and the EPA is finalizing its new carbon rules as well as tougher ozone restrictions that should add to the burden . That \u2019 s why the Sierra Club finds itself in foxholes with big-box stores , manufacturers and other business interests , fighting coal upgrades that would jack up electricity bills , pushing for cheaper renewables and energy efficiency instead . In a case I watched in Oklahoma City , every stakeholder supported Beyond Coal \u2019 s push for a utility to buy more low-cost wind power\u2014including a coalition of industrial customers that reportedly included a Koch Industries-owned paper mill .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not burning bras . They \u2019 re fighting dollar to dollar , \u201d says attorney Jim Roth , who represented a group of hospitals on Beyond Coal \u2019 s side in the Oklahoma case . \u201c They \u2019 ve become masters at bringing financial arguments to environmental questions . \u201d\nAs the affordability case for coal has lost traction , the industry \u2019 s defenders have portrayed the war on coal as a war on reliability , an assault on 24-hour \u201c baseload \u201d plants that provide juice when the sun isn \u2019 t shining and the wind isn \u2019 t blowing . They ask how the Sierra Club expects America to run its refrigerators around the clock\u2014since it also opposes nuclear power and has a separate Beyond Gas campaign . Duncan \u2019 s group started a Twitter meme warning that Americans could end up # ColdInTheDark , and even Bloomberg suggested to me in a recent interview that the Club \u2019 s leaders seem to want Americans to wear loincloths and live in caves .\nIn fact , neither the decline of coal , nor the boom in renewables has blacked out the grid , and Beyond Coal \u2019 s leaders are confident electricity markets can handle much more intermittent power . In any case , they see coal as the lowest-hanging fruit in the struggle to stabilize the climate , not only our dirtiest fossil fuel but the one with the cheapest alternatives . In the long run , combating global warming will depend on a multitude of factors , from electric vehicles to carbon releases from deforestation to methane releases from belching cows , but for the next decade , our climate progress depends mostly on reducing our reliance on the black stuff . Coal retirements have enabled Obama to pledge U.S. emissions cuts of up to 28 percent by 2025 , which has , in turn , enabled him to strike a climate deal with China and pursue a global deal later this year in Paris .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve found the secret sauce to making progress in unlikely places , \u201d says Bruce Nilles , who leads Beyond Coal from the Club \u2019 s San Francisco headquarters . \u201c And every time we beat the coal boys , people say : \u2018 Whoa . It can be done . \u2019 \u201d\nThe Sierra Club can \u2019 t claim full credit for the coal bust . It didn \u2019 t ratchet down the prices of gas , wind and solar or enact the flurry of EPA rules ratcheting up the price of coal , although its lobbyists and lawyers have pushed hard for government support for renewables while fighting in court over just about every coal-related regulation . It didn \u2019 t produce the energy efficiency boom that has reined in electricity demand , either . Still , a Bloomberg Philanthropies analysis found that at least 40 percent of U.S. coal retirements could not have happened without Beyond Coal \u2019 s advocacy . The status quo wields a lot of power in the heavily regulated power sector , where economics and mathematics don \u2019 t always beat politics and inertia . The case for change keeps getting stronger , but someone has to make the case .\nWhen Mary Anne Hitt , Beyond Coal \u2019 s national director , first visited Indianapolis to fight an inner-city plant , the headline in the Star was : \u201c Beyond Coal \u2019 s Director Faces Tough Sell in Indiana. \u201d But after two years of door-knocking , phone-banking and educating officials on the new realities of electricity , the Sierra Club and its local partners helped shut down the plant . Hitt has seen the same kind of miracle in Chicago , in Omaha , alongside a Paiute tribe reservation in Nevada , even in coal strongholds like Kentucky . It \u2019 s starting to feel more like a pattern than a miracle .\n\u201c David is fighting Goliath every day , and David keeps winning , \u201d Hitt says .\nEnergy analysts have a way of making Goliath \u2019 s new underdog status seem inevitable . Then again , it wasn \u2019 t long ago that their burning question about the U.S. coal industry was not how fast it would go away , but how fast it would grow .\nMike Duncan , a former RNC chairman who now heads the industry-backed American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , says of Beyond Coal : \u201c I don \u2019 t like what they \u2019 re doing ; we \u2019 re losing a lot of coal in this country . But they do show up. \u201d | AP Photo\nThe story of coal is a rich vein in the American story , powering our industry , our railroads , our politics . For decades , the work of extracting coal after millions of years underground\u2014so dangerous for some , so lucrative for others\u2014was seen as God \u2019 s work . The alchemy of converting coal into valuable energy was seen as a fulfillment of America \u2019 s destiny to exploit nature for the benefit of mankind , even as the smog spewing out of coal smokestacks was seen as part of the dystopia of urban life .\nThese days , growing concerns about climate have heightened concerns about coal , which produces 75 percent of the power sector \u2019 s carbon , and more emissions than all our cars and trucks combined . But even at the dawn of the 21st century , the George W. Bush administration \u2019 s main concern about coal power and fossil energy in general was that the U.S. wasn \u2019 t producing enough of it . In 2001 , an energy task force led by Dick Cheney , after a series of secret meetings with fossil-fuel executives , called for a new power-plant construction boom , warning that the alternative was a national reprise of the rolling blackouts that had just roiled California . Utilities quickly proposed about 200 new coal plants , and faced no organized national opposition . Coal plants have a useful lifespan of at least 40 years , so the U.S. was poised to lock in a new generation of dirty power . And all that new capacity was poised to destroy any incentive to develop clean wind or solar power .\nThat \u2019 s when the Sierra Club got into its first big coal fight over a proposed billion-dollar plant south of Chicago , a welcome-to-the-NFL episode . The Chicago area already had poor air quality\u2014the coal plants around the Loop were known as the Ring of Fire\u2014and local volunteers , led by an indefatigable German immigrant named Verena Owen , were desperate to block the project . Their cause seemed hopeless , but for Owen , who is now Beyond Coal \u2019 s lead volunteer , it was personal . Her best friend had struggled to breathe whenever the air was hazy and eventually died of lung disease , leaving behind a daughter in kindergarten . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how many people we ended up saving , but I know one we didn \u2019 t , \u201d Owen says .\nThe first time Nilles , at the time a lawyer for the Sierra Club \u2019 s Midwest office in Chicago , tried to attend a hearing about the plant , union members who supported the project came early and packed the hall while the Club was holding a news conference . Illinois regulators soon rubber-stamped the permit . Owen and Nilles can still recite the date and time of the news dump : Friday , Oct. 10 , 2003 , at 5:10 p.m. , so the bureaucrats could ignore their calls and escape for the weekend . And the industry had an even easier time of it elsewhere . Nilles later reviewed the record for another billion-dollar plant that broke ground in Iowa about the same time , and discovered there hadn \u2019 t been a single public comment in opposition .\n\u201c Everything was going full speed in the wrong direction , and we had no capacity to fight , \u201d he says . \u201c We realized we needed a strategy . Fast . \u201d\nThe strategy that Nilles devised was to fight every new plant from every conceivable environmental , economic and political angle . The Sierra Club began organizing boot camps to teach lawyers and volunteers around the region how to block coal permits . Demand for the seminars was so intense that , at one point , Nilles \u2019 boss had to remind him that Texas was not part of the Midwest . But he figured Texans who breathed air and drank water had as much to lose from exposure to coal-fired pollutants as Midwesterners had . Some of the Club \u2019 s funders thought his fight-everything-everywhere approach was unrealistic during a national coal rush , but every proposed plant was in someone \u2019 s backyard , and the Club had members in every corner of the country . Nilles couldn \u2019 t imagine telling any of them their communities would have to be sacrificed for the greater tactical good .\nEnvironmentalists have always been good at blocking stuff , and over the next few years , the kitchen-sink strategy produced some improbable victories . Nilles exploited threats to an endangered clover to delay the Chicago-area plant , and the utility eventually abandoned it . A local Sierra Club chapter stopped a massive plant in Kentucky coal country after a 63-day hearing , convincing regulators that the proposal had inadequate pollution controls , and that adequate controls would be exorbitant for ratepayers . These were shoestring crusades with expert witnesses crashing on the couches of volunteers , but the victories felt contagious , spreading hope to activists in other states who read about them on the Club \u2019 s coal listserv .\nMeanwhile , the Sierra Club was canvassing its members to develop a new long-term strategic plan . To the surprise of then-Director Carl Pope , they overwhelmingly wanted climate and energy to be the top priority , a major shift for a group that had emphasized wilderness conservation since its creation by the legendary outdoorsman John Muir . At a meeting in Tucson in early 2006 , the Club \u2019 s board voted to build the fledgling Midwestern anti-coal effort into a national campaign . Climate activists are often accused of wasting energy on symbolic movement-building efforts with relatively limited impact on emissions , like their crusades to stop Keystone and get universities to divest from fossil fuels . Beyond Coal \u2019 s leaders do oppose the pipeline and support the divestment movement , but the rationale for the campaign was all about hunting where the ducks are .\n\u201c It was existential necessity : Look how many coal plants they want to build . Look how much carbon they \u2019 d produce . Well , it \u2019 s game over if we don \u2019 t stop them , \u201d Pope recalls . \u201c If we were going to focus on climate , we had to focus on coal . \u201d\nIn a bow to political realism , the initial goal was to make sure coal was \u201c mined responsibly , burned cleanly and disposed of safely. \u201d But the campaigners didn \u2019 t really believe coal could be burned cleanly . The original mouthful of a mission soon evolved to \u201c Move Beyond Coal , \u201d then just \u201c Beyond Coal. \u201d It was a much simpler message , helping to unite a variety of activists\u2014working for specific neighborhoods , Indian tribes , mountains targeted by mining outfits , public health , environmental justice , clean energy , and the climate\u2014against a common enemy . The Sierra Club would be the one constant presence in the war on coal , but it began partnering with more than 100 local , regional and national groups in its battles around the country .\nThe campaign was remarkably successful . Nilles and his team scoured every permit application for vulnerabilities and managed to block all but 30 of the 200 plants proposed in the Bush era . The nice thing about fighting new plants was that they didn \u2019 t exist yet , so it only took one deal breaker\u2014too much smog in a high-smog area , too close to a national park , too expensive for ratepayers , whatever\u2014to break a deal . Some of the plants that did get built still haunt Nilles , but those defeats did not doom the decarbonization of America . The game was not over .\nBy 2008 , with the economy crashing and power demand slumping , utilities had stopped pushing new coal plants . That \u2019 s when Nilles began plotting to go after old ones\u2014an even tougher challenge , but a vital one to avoid the game-over scenario . He had moved to the liberal college town of Madison , and he was amazed that an old coal plant a mile from his home still had no pollution controls ; it was way dirtier than the new plants he was fighting around the country . The nation \u2019 s fleet of existing coal plants was still emitting nearly 2 billion tons of carbon and causing an estimated 13,000 premature deaths every year . It felt good to stop projects that would have increased those numbers , but Nilles wanted to use the Club \u2019 s newfound expertise to reduce them .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a lot easier to throw ourselves in front of bulldozers to stop something than it is to shut something down that \u2019 s already part of the community , paying taxes , generating power , providing jobs , \u201d Nilles says . \u201c But that \u2019 s where the emissions are . \u201d\nThat was also the year Obama won the presidency , creating hope for stricter EPA regulation of sulfur , soot and ozone , plus the first-ever regulations of mercury , coal ash and carbon . As difficult as it would be to kill plants that had been operating for decades\u2014two-thirds of the coal fleet predated the Clean Air Act of 1970\u2014Nilles thought the combination of top-down rules from Washington and bottom-up pressure at state and local hearings could force utilities to confront investment decisions they had been delaying all those decades . Most utilities would need approval from their financial and environmental regulators before they could install expensive pollution controls . And while the utilities might be happy to charge their customers tens of millions of dollars for upgrades in order to comply with one new rule\u2014plus a tidy profit they \u2019 re usually guaranteed for capital improvements\u2014utility commissions might not let them start down that road if they faced hundreds of millions of dollars in additional compliance costs from rules still to come .\nOnce again , the campaign produced some inspiring early wins , including the retirement of that antiquated plant near Nilles in Madison . He also filed a lawsuit against his alma mater , the University of Wisconsin , to get it off coal . The Club quickly found that when it could stop investor-owned utilities from getting a blank check to charge ratepayers for coal upgrades , they would usually shut down the plants rather than risk shareholder dollars . That was even true in coal country , where homeowners , businesses and regulators were just as allergic to pricey upgrades\u2014and utilities were just as reluctant to foot the bill themselves . As Nilles \u2019 new deputy , Hitt , a West Virginia activist who had spent years trying to stop mining companies from blowing up mountains in Appalachia , found she could do more to protect the mountains by shutting down the plants that used their coal .\nBeyond Coal had grown from three staffers to a 15-state operation , but it still lacked the scale to fight 523 plants all over the country . It needed to get a lot bigger . That \u2019 s when the combative billionaire who has financed his own wars on guns , tobacco and Big Gulps took an interest in the war on coal .\nBeyond Coal \u2019 s pivotal moment came at a meeting in Gracie Mansion about , of all things , education reform . Michael Bloomberg , the Wall Street savant-turned media mogul-turned New York City mayor , was looking for a new outlet for his private philanthropy . It quickly became clear that education reform would not be that outlet .\n\u201c It was a terrible meeting in every way , and Mike was angry , \u201d recalls his longtime adviser , Kevin Sheekey . \u201c I said : \u2018 Look , if you don \u2019 t like this idea , that \u2019 s fine . We \u2019 ll bring you another. \u2019 He said : \u2018 No , I want another now . \u2019 \u201d\nAs it happened , Sheekey had just eaten lunch with Carl Pope , who was starting a $ 50 million fundraising drive to expand Beyond Coal \u2019 s staff to 45 states . The cap-and-trade plan that Obama supported to cut carbon emissions had stalled in Congress , and the carbon tax that Bloomberg supported was going nowhere as well . Washington was gridlocked . But Pope had explained to Sheekey that shutting down coal plants at the state and local level could do even more for the climate\u2014and have a huge impact on public health issues close to his boss \u2019 s heart .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a good idea , \u201d Bloomberg told Sheekey . \u201c We \u2019 ll just give Carl a check for the $ 50 million . Tell him to stop fundraising and get to work . \u201d\nBloomberg had never thought of himself as a Sierra Club kind of guy . But he saw coal as a killer , as well as the main threat to the climate , and the Club was in the field doing something about it . His only demand was a more analytical approach to the war on coal , with measurable deliverables , complex predictive models for vulnerable plants , and KPI\u2014Key Performance Indicators , as Pope later learned .\n\u201c The Sierra Club had never heard of KPI , \u201d Pope says . \u201c We just had a gut instinct for what would work . The mayor said : \u2018 Oh , no , no . This will be data-driven . \u2019 \u201d\nOn a sweltering day in July 2011 , Bloomberg announced his gift to the Club on a boat he had chartered on the Potomac River , in front of a 63-year-old coal plant he had always noticed on flights into Washington . He saw it as a perfect illustration of the city \u2019 s inability to get anything done .\n\u201c You \u2019 d think the politicians would at least care about the air they breathe themselves ! \u201d Bloomberg marveled to me in a recent interview .\nThat plant on the Potomac is now closed . So is the Massachusetts plant that Mitt Romney once said \u201c kills people , \u201d a line Obama actually used against him in coal-state campaign ads in 2012 . So are all of Chicago \u2019 s plants , as Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted in his first campaign ad in 2015 . Overall , the 190 plants that U.S. utilities have agreed to retire will eliminate about one fourth of America \u2019 s coal-fired capacity , a total of 79 gigawatts . And for every watt of coal capacity they \u2019 re taking out of commission , they \u2019 ve already installed a watt of wind or solar capacity . The Clean Air Task Force estimate of coal-fired premature deaths is down to about 7,500 a year , a decrease of 5,500 since Beyond Coal went national . And Bloomberg \u2019 s early support has helped attract more than $ 100 million from top foundations and wealthy individuals like the Silicon Valley billionaire Tom Steyer , the climate movement \u2019 s top political donor .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a reminder that you can do a lot with no help from Congress , \u201d Bloomberg says . \u201c I just wish we could point out the specific people who were saved . \u201d\nTo coal backers , Beyond Coal is pure urban elitist lunacy , the kind of nightmare you get when a nanny-state mayor from New York hooks up with eco-radicals from San Francisco and a liberal president in Washington . Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma\u2014chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , author of \u201c The Greatest Hoax , \u201d thrower of a Senate-floor snowball designed to highlight the folly of global-warming alarmism\u2014told me it \u2019 s hard to believe some Americans actually want to keep our abundant energy resources in the ground .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a war on all fossil fuels , and coal is the No . 1 target , \u201d Inhofe says . \u201c You got a president who doesn \u2019 t care how many jobs it costs , and rich people who don \u2019 t care how much money they spend . They can do a lot of damage . \u201d\nI got to watch the war in Inhofe \u2019 s state , and the damage wasn \u2019 t getting done the way Inhofe imagined . The job creators were siding with the environmentalists . Economics was the most powerful weapon in the Sierra Club \u2019 s arsenal .\nAt a dry hearing in a drab courtroom in Oklahoma City , a methodical Beyond Coal attorney named Kristin Henry , whose bio identifies her as \u201c one of the few environmentalists who would never be caught wearing Birkenstocks , \u201d was pinning down an Oklahoma Gas & Electric executive with a barrage of wouldn \u2019 t-you-agrees , isn \u2019 t-it-trues , and would-it-be-fair-to-say \u2019 s . The power company was out of compliance with a federal air-quality rule called \u201c regional haze , \u201d so it was offering to convert one of its two coal plants into a natural gas plant . Henry knew she couldn \u2019 t stop that . But OG & E also wanted to install massive new scrubbers on the other plant so it could keep burning coal for decades to come . Henry was determined to stop that .\nIn the 90 minutes Henry spent cross-examining OG & E \u2019 s Joseph Rowlett in early March , she didn \u2019 t ask a single question about climate or public health . She focused exclusively on OG & E \u2019 s request for the largest rate increase in state history , a 15 percent hike to finance the utility \u2019 s $ 700 million compliance plan . Through her deadpan , leading questions , she portrayed OG & E as a company desperate to get its customers to foot the bill to prop up an inefficient plant , pursuing retrofits it would never consider if its own shareholders had to swallow the costs , operating in a dream world where regional haze was coal \u2019 s only challenge . At one point , she got Rowlett to admit his calculations assumed there would be no additional coal regulations for the next thirty years , even though the EPA intends to finalize at least four new coal regulations this year alone .\n\u201c Isn \u2019 t it true you \u2019 re assuming zero over the next 30 years ? \u201d Henry asked .\nThe Sierra Club , even though it didn \u2019 t sound much like the Sierra Club , was clearly in hostile political territory . Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , a conservative Republican who has spearheaded a national campaign to protect fossil fuels from legal challenges , had joined OG & E in fighting the EPA haze rule all the way to the Supreme Court . Now he was supposed to be representing consumers at the OG & E hearing before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission , but he hadn \u2019 t even filed a brief about the record rate hike . \u201c That \u2019 s unheard of , \u201d one commission official told me . Pruitt didn \u2019 t attend the hearing , either\u2014the day it began , he was in Tulsa with Mike Huckabee raising money for his PAC\u2014but one of his deputies who did attend occasionally raised objections when OG & E witnesses were asked uncomfortable questions .\nBut if the political deck seemed stacked against the Sierra Club , Henry held the economic cards . In Oklahoma , coal imported from Wyoming now costs more per kilowatt hour than the abundant gas under the ground or the wind that famously comes sweeping down the plain . In another recent haze case , the Sierra Club cut a deal requiring Oklahoma \u2019 s other major utility to phase out its only coal plant and buy 200 megawatts of wind\u2014and the bids came in so low , the utility ended up buying 600 megawatts of wind . That \u2019 s why Wal-Mart , the hospital group and the coalition of industrial ratepayers all supported Beyond Coal \u2019 s push for more wind in the OG & E case . Cheap electricity has a way of scrambling political alliances .\nHenry and the lawyers for OG & E \u2019 s corporate customers formed a kind of tag team , taking turns blasting the company for refusing to even study new wind power . They repeatedly pointed out that in-state competitors as well as Florida and New Mexico utilities were buying Oklahoma wind for just 2 cents per kilowatt hour , even cheaper than coal without pollution controls , while OG & E hadn \u2019 t purchased new wind in four years\u2014even though its ads boasted about its commitment to wind . When its witnesses claimed their transmission lines were too congested to add new wind , Henry produced internal documents suggesting the congestion could be fixed for about 3 percent of the cost of the new coal scrubbers . As she pointed out , other Oklahoma utilities have much higher percentages of wind power on their systems .\nClosing coal plants can sound radical , but Henry framed it for the Republican utility commissioners as the conservative response to EPA rules , avoiding the risk of \u201c stranded \u201d investments in outdated plants that might have to be shut down anyway . The most economical way to meet haze limits , she suggested , would be to stop burning the coal that causes the haze . Al Armendariz , who was Obama \u2019 s Dallas-based regional EPA administrator and is now Beyond Coal \u2019 s Austin-based regional representative , says the Club \u2019 s victories in states like Georgia , Mississippi and Kentucky have helped normalize the idea of abandoning coal in Oklahoma .\n\u201c We get respect because of our track record , \u201d Armendariz says . \u201c When we say a utility isn \u2019 t acting prudently , people can \u2019 t just dismiss us as \u2018 Oh , of course the Sierra Club says that. \u2019 They see how we keep winning . They see these big industrial customers agreeing with us . Then they look at the numbers and see we \u2019 re right . \u201d\nStill , there \u2019 s no denying the war on coal is leading America into uncharted territory . The Sierra Club wants to eliminate all coal power by 2030 , but what will replace it ? Wind and solar , despite their rapid Obama-era growth , still make up just 5 percent of U.S. power capacity . And while technologies to store renewable energy ( such as Tesla \u2019 s newly announced battery packs ) are getting cheaper , they \u2019 re still a rounding error on the grid . Beyond Coal \u2019 s leaders are content to push cleaner power and let utilities figure out how to deliver it , but as OG & E Vice President Paul Renfrow told me : \u201c That \u2019 s easy for them to say . We have to keep the lights on . \u201d\nInhofe thinks the Sierra Club is simply obsessed with rooting out fossil fuels , citing \u201c the guy who wants to crucify people \u201d as an example of its extremism . He meant Armendariz , who left the EPA after he was caught on tape suggesting that harsh sanctions for law-breaking oil and gas companies could scare others into compliance , just as public crucifixions helped keep the peace in Roman times .\n\u201c The Sierra Club wants to stop coal now ? \u201d Inhofe asked . \u201c You \u2019 ll see , they \u2019 ll be after gas next . \u201d\nLong-term , he \u2019 s right . While the Club accepted some donations from natural gas interests under Pope , it is now formally committed to eliminating gas as well as coal by 2030 , and it has helped block new gas plants in cities like Austin and Carlsbad , California . After its victory last week in Asheville , Beyond Coal vowed to keep fighting to overturn Duke Energy \u2019 s decision to build a new gas plant to replace its 50-year-old coal plant . Even Bloomberg thinks the Club \u2019 s opposition to the fracking boom that has helped replace so much domestic coal with domestic gas is silly .\nThat said , Beyond Coal \u2019 s leaders , including Armendariz , understand that Beyond Gas is more aspirational than practical for now . They deeply prefer renewables to gas , but they almost as deeply prefer gas to coal . In Oklahoma City , Henry grilled OG & E witnesses about why they wanted to spend $ 500 million on scrubbers for coal boilers that could be retrofitted to burn gas for just $ 70 million . She shredded the implausible assumptions OG & E had made in its economic models to make scrubbing coal look cheaper than converting to gas , forcing one witness to admit gas prices were already 25 percent lower than his low-cost scenario . I sat in on one friendly lunch the Club \u2019 s legal team had with lawyers for a Conoco Phillips front group ; they all hoped to move OG & E beyond coal , and gas is clearly part of the short-term solution .\nWhen Brune took over the Sierra Club in 2010 , he halted the club \u2019 s gas-industry gifts . | Getty\n\u201c We want to be principled but pragmatic , \u201d says Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune , who stopped the Club \u2019 s gas-industry gifts when he took over in 2010 . \u201c We \u2019 ve wrestled with this , and there \u2019 s a definite disagreement with Bloomberg . We don \u2019 t see gas as an environmental fix . But we acknowledge that we still need some gas . \u201d\nCoal is different . Bloomberg calls it \u201c a dead man walking. \u201d When he made his initial gift to the Sierra Club , the goal was to secure the retirements of one third of the coal fleet by 2015 . The Club is only slightly behind schedule , and in April , Bloomberg came to Washington to announce another $ 30 million donation , with a new goal of retirement announcements for half of the fleet by 2017 . \u201c We \u2019 re doubling down on an incredibly successful strategy , \u201d Bloomberg said .\nThe campaign \u2019 s leaders believe coal has already passed a tipping point toward oblivion . Coal giants like Alpha Natural Resources , Arch Coal and Walter Energy are struggling to stay afloat . Just last week , in addition to the retirement announcement for the Asheville plant\u2014as well as another for a Milwaukee plant that wasn \u2019 t official enough for Beyond Coal to count as # 191\u2014the insurance giant AXA announced that it will sell off more than $ 500 million worth of coal investments , the largest financial institution to flee the space to date , while the EPA announced it was closing a loophole that allowed virtually unlimited emissions from malfunctioning coal plants , a response to yet another Sierra Club lawsuit . And the more dirty plants get shut down , the more residents near other dirty plants are asking : Why not ours ?\nIt \u2019 s hard to change the status quo , no matter how compelling the economic logic . Beyond Coal does not just deploy data . It organizes rallies and petitions and float-ins on kayaks ; it shames utility executives on billboards and airplane banners ; it mobilizes its members to show up at boring hearings where showing up can make a difference . If the Oklahoma City case displayed the war on coal as a numerical dispute , another hearing I watched south of Detroit was more like a street fight .\nRiver Rouge is a depressed community at the city \u2019 s edge , a blightscape of boarded-up bungalows , overgrown lots and pawn shops . There \u2019 s no grocery store and virtually no medical services , but there is a nice little park where kids play at the playground and adults fish in the Detroit River . Unfortunately , the park smells like rotten eggs , thanks to sulfur dioxide from a DTE Energy coal plant overlooking the playground . Michigan health officials have called this area \u201c the epicenter of the state \u2019 s asthma burden. \u201d The fish aren \u2019 t safe to eat , either , though people eat them .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just an unhealthy situation , \u201d says Alisha Winters , a local resident and mother of seven children , two with asthma . \u201c They figure they can get away with dumping on us . \u201d\nThe EPA has called out this area \u2019 s elevated sulfur dioxide levels , and last year Republican Governor Rick Snyder \u2019 s administration floated a compliance plan that would have required DTE to upgrade the coal-fired River Rouge Power Plant or ( more likely ) close it . But DTE proposed an alternative plan with no costly upgrades , and the state quietly accepted it . The Sierra Club has been mobilizing opposition ever since , drawing an unusual coalition of local whites , African-Americans , Latinos and Arab-Americans\u2014as well as a busload of white liberals from Ann Arbor\u2014for an environmental hearing in mid-March . The hearing had to be moved from City Hall to a school auditorium to accommodate the groundswell of protests , a far cry from that Chicago-area hearing over a decade ago where the Sierra Club got frozen out .\n\u201c We \u2019 re getting people to cross borders , physical and imaginary , \u201d says Rhonda Anderson , a sharecropper \u2019 s daughter who is now an organizer for Beyond Coal .\nIf the Oklahoma City hearing was financial , the River Rouge hearing was political , a multiracial show of force in \u201c I Love Clean Air \u201d T-shirts . Every speaker opposed the DTE plan , including an Indian-American medical student , an Arab-American law student , an African-American asthma educator , a Latina anti-poverty activist and a white nun . Ebony Elmore , a child care provider who lives a block from the plant , talked about her four siblings and three nieces with asthma , as well as her two parents with pulmonary disease . I happened to ask Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell , who was watching the testimony from the side of the hall , why she was there , just as another resident started telling a story about an 11-year-old local girl who died because she couldn \u2019 t get to her inhaler in time .\nA few days later , Governor Snyder\u2014whose top campaign supporters included one Michael Bloomberg\u2014announced a new effort to cut Michigan \u2019 s reliance on coal . That would have been a huge political burden for Snyder if he had run for president in a GOP primary , where \u201c anti-coal \u201d will be an epithet like \u201c anti-gun \u201d or \u201c anti-freedom , \u201d but he decided not to run , and coal is becoming a huge economic burden for his industrial state .\nThe already frenetic national pace of plant retirements will have to double for Beyond Coal to meet its 2017 goal , but utilities will face daunting investment decisions over the next two years . The EPA recently settled a sulfur lawsuit with the Sierra Club that could replicate the River Rouge dilemma across the nation . The agency has also imposed regional haze plans that already are replicating the Oklahoma dilemma in Arizona , Arkansas and Texas . Today , Beyond Coal has more than 100 legal cases pending over power supply . Meanwhile , it \u2019 s pursuing a new strategy on the power demand side , pushing blue states like Oregon to stop importing coal-fired electricity , which could shutter plants in red states like Montana . Even inside Texas , the Club has worked with relatively progressive cities like Austin , San Antonio and El Paso to replace their coal power with renewables .\nBeyond Coal is also continuing to lobby and litigate in Washington , pushing Obama to drop his \u201c all-of-the-above \u201d approach to energy and formally enlist in the war on coal . Obama has not been as maniacally anti-coal as the industry suggests , punting on ozone rules in his first term to avoid alienating voters in Ohio , issuing relatively weak restrictions on coal ash , taking a lenient approach to mining on public land , floating carbon rules with mild targets for the most coal-reliant states . Still , when you add up all he \u2019 s done and all he \u2019 s doing , you get a tremendously uncertain regulatory environment . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u2014whose wife , Elaine Chao , recently quit the Bloomberg Philanthropies board over coal\u2014has urged states to defy the Clean Power Plan , but utilities with fiduciary responsibilities don \u2019 t engage in much civil disobedience . They have already shut down dozens of plants to comply with mercury rules the Supreme Court could still strike down , and they \u2019 re starting to think about carbon , too .\nSome coal advocates still hold out hope that the decline can be reversed if Republicans can win the presidency and keep Congress . \u201c We \u2019 ve got a Congress that \u2019 s sympathetic , but we \u2019 ve still got a bureaucracy running amok , \u201d says Mike Duncan , the RNC chairman-turned-coal advocate . \u201c That will play in 2016 . Obviously , anytime you elect a leader , it \u2019 s important to this industry . \u201d\nIf the EPA stands down under the next president , the pace of retirements could slow . But it probably won \u2019 t stop . The trends are too strong . Nilles recently met with leaders of the utility Southern Company , which has slashed its dependence on coal in half over the past five years . Its executives rejected his vision of a coal-free America by 2030 , but some of them suggested 2050 could be realistic . In any case , the Sierra Club won a lot of coal fights during the pro-coal Bush administration , because they were ultimately local fights over local air .\nThe fights also have a global context . The Earth is already getting hotter , and the death of American coal would not avert a climate catastrophe if the rest of the world did not follow our lead . But the decline of American coal emissions will help U.S. negotiators insist that other countries do their part in the global negotiations in Paris . And while critics of climate action often grumble that it would be foolish for the U.S. to make sacrifices when China is still building a new coal plant every week , that \u2019 s no longer true . China actually decreased its coal use last year , and is shuttering all four plants in smog-shrouded Beijing . The trends killing coal in America\u2014cheap gas , wind and solar ; more energy efficiency ; stricter regulations\u2014are trending abroad as well . Cash-strapped U.S. mining firms are desperate to solve their domestic problems by selling more coal in foreign markets , but the Sierra Club has helped lead the fight to block six proposed coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest , which will help keep even more coal in the ground .\nThere will be no formal surrender in the war on coal , no battleship treaty to mark the end . But Beyond Coal \u2019 s leaders believe they can finish most of their work setting the U.S. electric sector on a greener path over the next five years . The next phase of the war on carbon would be to try to electrify everything else\u2014cars and trains that use oil-derived gasoline and diesel , as well as homes and businesses that rely on natural gas and heating oil . Nilles hopes power companies like OG & E and DTE that Beyond Coal has spent the last decade fighting with\u2014but then cutting deals with\u2014can become allies in Phase Two . And allies will be vital , because if King Coal seems like a rich and powerful enemy , it \u2019 s a pushover compared to Big Oil .\n\u201c Once we \u2019 ve taken out coal , we \u2019 ll need to take on oil , and who better to help than our new friends in the utility sector who can make money from electrification ? \u201d Nilles says with a grin . \u201c It \u2019 s a long fight . This is how we win . \u201d",
    "content_original": "The war on coal is not just political rhetoric, or a paranoid fantasy concocted by rapacious polluters. It\u2019s real and it\u2019s relentless. Over the past five years, it has killed a coal-fired power plant every 10 days. It has quietly transformed the U.S. electric grid and the global climate debate.\n\nThe industry and its supporters use \u201cwar on coal\u201d as shorthand for a ferocious assault by a hostile White House, but the real war on coal is not primarily an Obama war, or even a Washington war. It\u2019s a guerrilla war. The front lines are not at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Supreme Court. If you want to see how the fossil fuel that once powered most of the country is being battered by enemy forces, you have to watch state and local hearings where utility commissions and other obscure governing bodies debate individual coal plants. You probably won\u2019t find much drama. You\u2019ll definitely find lawyers from the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign, the boots on the ground in the war on coal.\n\nBeyond Coal is the most extensive, expensive and effective campaign in the Club\u2019s 123-year history, and maybe the history of the environmental movement. It\u2019s gone largely unnoticed amid the furor over the Keystone pipeline and President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to regulate carbon, but it\u2019s helped retire more than one third of America\u2019s coal plants since its launch in 2010, one dull hearing at a time. With a vast war chest donated by Michael Bloomberg, unlikely allies from the business world, and a strategy that relies more on economics than ecology, its team of nearly 200 litigators and organizers has won battles in the Midwestern and Appalachian coal belts, in the reddest of red states, in almost every state that burns coal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sophisticated, they\u2019re very active, and they\u2019re better funded than we are,\u201d says Mike Duncan, a former Republican National Committee chairman who now heads the industry-backed American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. \u201cI don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing; we\u2019re losing a lot of coal in this country. But they do show up.\u201d\n\nCoal still helps keep our lights on, generating nearly 40 percent of U.S. power. But it generated more than 50 percent just over a decade ago, and the big question now is how rapidly its decline will continue. Almost every watt of new generating capacity is coming from natural gas, wind or solar; the coal industry now employs fewer workers than the solar industry, which barely existed in 2010. Utilities no longer even bother to propose new coal plants to replace the old ones they retire. Coal industry stocks are tanking, and analysts are predicting a new wave of coal bankruptcies.\n\nThis is a big deal, because coal is America\u2019s top source of greenhouse gases, and coal retirements are the main reason U.S. carbon emissions have declined 10 percent in a decade. Coal is also America\u2019s top source of mercury, sulfur dioxide and other toxic air pollutants, so fewer coal plants also means less asthma and lung disease\u2014not to mention fewer coal-ash spills and coal-mining disasters. The shift toward cleaner-burning gas and zero-emissions renewables is the most important change in our electricity mix in decades, and while Obama has been an ally in the war on coal\u2014not always as aggressive an ally as the industry claims\u2014the Sierra Club is in the trenches. The U.S. had 523 coal-fired power plants when Beyond Coal began targeting them; just last week, it celebrated the 190th retirement of its campaign in Asheville, N.C., culminating a three-year fight that had been featured in the climate documentary \u201cYears of Living Dangerously.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeyond Coal isn\u2019t the stereotypical Sierra Club campaign, tree-huggers shouting save-the-Earth slogans. Yes, it sometimes deploys its 2.4 million-member, grass-roots army to shutter plants with traditional not-in-my-back-yard organizing and right-to-breathe agitating. But it usually wins by arguing that ditching coal will save ratepayers money.\n\nBloomberg has donated to the Sierra Club's vast war chest. | Getty | Getty | Getty\n\nBehind that argument lies a revolution in the economics of power, changes few Americans think about when they flick their switches. Coal used to be the cheapest form of electricity by far, but it\u2019s gotten pricier as it\u2019s been forced to clean up more of its mess, while the costs of gas, wind and solar have plunged in recent years. Now retrofitting old coal plants with the pollution controls needed to comply with Obama\u2019s limits on soot, sulfur and mercury is becoming cost-prohibitive\u2014and the EPA is finalizing its new carbon rules as well as tougher ozone restrictions that should add to the burden. That\u2019s why the Sierra Club finds itself in foxholes with big-box stores, manufacturers and other business interests, fighting coal upgrades that would jack up electricity bills, pushing for cheaper renewables and energy efficiency instead. In a case I watched in Oklahoma City, every stakeholder supported Beyond Coal\u2019s push for a utility to buy more low-cost wind power\u2014including a coalition of industrial customers that reportedly included a Koch Industries-owned paper mill.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not burning bras. They\u2019re fighting dollar to dollar,\u201d says attorney Jim Roth, who represented a group of hospitals on Beyond Coal\u2019s side in the Oklahoma case. \u201cThey\u2019ve become masters at bringing financial arguments to environmental questions.\u201d\n\nAs the affordability case for coal has lost traction, the industry\u2019s defenders have portrayed the war on coal as a war on reliability, an assault on 24-hour \u201cbaseload\u201d plants that provide juice when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing. They ask how the Sierra Club expects America to run its refrigerators around the clock\u2014since it also opposes nuclear power and has a separate Beyond Gas campaign. Duncan\u2019s group started a Twitter meme warning that Americans could end up #ColdInTheDark, and even Bloomberg suggested to me in a recent interview that the Club\u2019s leaders seem to want Americans to wear loincloths and live in caves.\n\nIn fact, neither the decline of coal, nor the boom in renewables has blacked out the grid, and Beyond Coal\u2019s leaders are confident electricity markets can handle much more intermittent power. In any case, they see coal as the lowest-hanging fruit in the struggle to stabilize the climate, not only our dirtiest fossil fuel but the one with the cheapest alternatives. In the long run, combating global warming will depend on a multitude of factors, from electric vehicles to carbon releases from deforestation to methane releases from belching cows, but for the next decade, our climate progress depends mostly on reducing our reliance on the black stuff. Coal retirements have enabled Obama to pledge U.S. emissions cuts of up to 28 percent by 2025, which has, in turn, enabled him to strike a climate deal with China and pursue a global deal later this year in Paris.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found the secret sauce to making progress in unlikely places,\u201d says Bruce Nilles, who leads Beyond Coal from the Club\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cAnd every time we beat the coal boys, people say: \u2018Whoa. It can be done.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Sierra Club can\u2019t claim full credit for the coal bust. It didn\u2019t ratchet down the prices of gas, wind and solar or enact the flurry of EPA rules ratcheting up the price of coal, although its lobbyists and lawyers have pushed hard for government support for renewables while fighting in court over just about every coal-related regulation. It didn\u2019t produce the energy efficiency boom that has reined in electricity demand, either. Still, a Bloomberg Philanthropies analysis found that at least 40 percent of U.S. coal retirements could not have happened without Beyond Coal\u2019s advocacy. The status quo wields a lot of power in the heavily regulated power sector, where economics and mathematics don\u2019t always beat politics and inertia. The case for change keeps getting stronger, but someone has to make the case.\n\nWhen Mary Anne Hitt, Beyond Coal\u2019s national director, first visited Indianapolis to fight an inner-city plant, the headline in the Star was: \u201cBeyond Coal\u2019s Director Faces Tough Sell in Indiana.\u201d But after two years of door-knocking, phone-banking and educating officials on the new realities of electricity, the Sierra Club and its local partners helped shut down the plant. Hitt has seen the same kind of miracle in Chicago, in Omaha, alongside a Paiute tribe reservation in Nevada, even in coal strongholds like Kentucky. It\u2019s starting to feel more like a pattern than a miracle.\n\n\u201cDavid is fighting Goliath every day, and David keeps winning,\u201d Hitt says.\n\nEnergy analysts have a way of making Goliath\u2019s new underdog status seem inevitable. Then again, it wasn\u2019t long ago that their burning question about the U.S. coal industry was not how fast it would go away, but how fast it would grow.\n\nMike Duncan, a former RNC chairman who now heads the industry-backed American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, says of Beyond Coal: \u201cI don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing; we\u2019re losing a lot of coal in this country. But they do show up.\u201d | AP Photo\n\nThe story of coal is a rich vein in the American story, powering our industry, our railroads, our politics. For decades, the work of extracting coal after millions of years underground\u2014so dangerous for some, so lucrative for others\u2014was seen as God\u2019s work. The alchemy of converting coal into valuable energy was seen as a fulfillment of America\u2019s destiny to exploit nature for the benefit of mankind, even as the smog spewing out of coal smokestacks was seen as part of the dystopia of urban life.\n\nThese days, growing concerns about climate have heightened concerns about coal, which produces 75 percent of the power sector\u2019s carbon, and more emissions than all our cars and trucks combined. But even at the dawn of the 21st century, the George W. Bush administration\u2019s main concern about coal power and fossil energy in general was that the U.S. wasn\u2019t producing enough of it. In 2001, an energy task force led by Dick Cheney, after a series of secret meetings with fossil-fuel executives, called for a new power-plant construction boom, warning that the alternative was a national reprise of the rolling blackouts that had just roiled California. Utilities quickly proposed about 200 new coal plants, and faced no organized national opposition. Coal plants have a useful lifespan of at least 40 years, so the U.S. was poised to lock in a new generation of dirty power. And all that new capacity was poised to destroy any incentive to develop clean wind or solar power.\n\nThat\u2019s when the Sierra Club got into its first big coal fight over a proposed billion-dollar plant south of Chicago, a welcome-to-the-NFL episode. The Chicago area already had poor air quality\u2014the coal plants around the Loop were known as the Ring of Fire\u2014and local volunteers, led by an indefatigable German immigrant named Verena Owen, were desperate to block the project. Their cause seemed hopeless, but for Owen, who is now Beyond Coal\u2019s lead volunteer, it was personal. Her best friend had struggled to breathe whenever the air was hazy and eventually died of lung disease, leaving behind a daughter in kindergarten. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people we ended up saving, but I know one we didn\u2019t,\u201d Owen says.\n\nThe first time Nilles, at the time a lawyer for the Sierra Club\u2019s Midwest office in Chicago, tried to attend a hearing about the plant, union members who supported the project came early and packed the hall while the Club was holding a news conference. Illinois regulators soon rubber-stamped the permit. Owen and Nilles can still recite the date and time of the news dump: Friday, Oct. 10, 2003, at 5:10 p.m., so the bureaucrats could ignore their calls and escape for the weekend. And the industry had an even easier time of it elsewhere. Nilles later reviewed the record for another billion-dollar plant that broke ground in Iowa about the same time, and discovered there hadn\u2019t been a single public comment in opposition.\n\n\u201cEverything was going full speed in the wrong direction, and we had no capacity to fight,\u201d he says. \u201cWe realized we needed a strategy. Fast.\u201d\n\nThe strategy that Nilles devised was to fight every new plant from every conceivable environmental, economic and political angle. The Sierra Club began organizing boot camps to teach lawyers and volunteers around the region how to block coal permits. Demand for the seminars was so intense that, at one point, Nilles\u2019 boss had to remind him that Texas was not part of the Midwest. But he figured Texans who breathed air and drank water had as much to lose from exposure to coal-fired pollutants as Midwesterners had. Some of the Club\u2019s funders thought his fight-everything-everywhere approach was unrealistic during a national coal rush, but every proposed plant was in someone\u2019s backyard, and the Club had members in every corner of the country. Nilles couldn\u2019t imagine telling any of them their communities would have to be sacrificed for the greater tactical good.\n\nEnvironmentalists have always been good at blocking stuff, and over the next few years, the kitchen-sink strategy produced some improbable victories. Nilles exploited threats to an endangered clover to delay the Chicago-area plant, and the utility eventually abandoned it. A local Sierra Club chapter stopped a massive plant in Kentucky coal country after a 63-day hearing, convincing regulators that the proposal had inadequate pollution controls, and that adequate controls would be exorbitant for ratepayers. These were shoestring crusades with expert witnesses crashing on the couches of volunteers, but the victories felt contagious, spreading hope to activists in other states who read about them on the Club\u2019s coal listserv.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sierra Club was canvassing its members to develop a new long-term strategic plan. To the surprise of then-Director Carl Pope, they overwhelmingly wanted climate and energy to be the top priority, a major shift for a group that had emphasized wilderness conservation since its creation by the legendary outdoorsman John Muir. At a meeting in Tucson in early 2006, the Club\u2019s board voted to build the fledgling Midwestern anti-coal effort into a national campaign. Climate activists are often accused of wasting energy on symbolic movement-building efforts with relatively limited impact on emissions, like their crusades to stop Keystone and get universities to divest from fossil fuels. Beyond Coal\u2019s leaders do oppose the pipeline and support the divestment movement, but the rationale for the campaign was all about hunting where the ducks are.\n\n\u201cIt was existential necessity: Look how many coal plants they want to build. Look how much carbon they\u2019d produce. Well, it\u2019s game over if we don\u2019t stop them,\u201d Pope recalls. \u201cIf we were going to focus on climate, we had to focus on coal.\u201d\n\nIn a bow to political realism, the initial goal was to make sure coal was \u201cmined responsibly, burned cleanly and disposed of safely.\u201d But the campaigners didn\u2019t really believe coal could be burned cleanly. The original mouthful of a mission soon evolved to \u201cMove Beyond Coal,\u201d then just \u201cBeyond Coal.\u201d It was a much simpler message, helping to unite a variety of activists\u2014working for specific neighborhoods, Indian tribes, mountains targeted by mining outfits, public health, environmental justice, clean energy, and the climate\u2014against a common enemy. The Sierra Club would be the one constant presence in the war on coal, but it began partnering with more than 100 local, regional and national groups in its battles around the country.\n\nThe campaign was remarkably successful. Nilles and his team scoured every permit application for vulnerabilities and managed to block all but 30 of the 200 plants proposed in the Bush era. The nice thing about fighting new plants was that they didn\u2019t exist yet, so it only took one deal breaker\u2014too much smog in a high-smog area, too close to a national park, too expensive for ratepayers, whatever\u2014to break a deal. Some of the plants that did get built still haunt Nilles, but those defeats did not doom the decarbonization of America. The game was not over.\n\nBy 2008, with the economy crashing and power demand slumping, utilities had stopped pushing new coal plants. That\u2019s when Nilles began plotting to go after old ones\u2014an even tougher challenge, but a vital one to avoid the game-over scenario. He had moved to the liberal college town of Madison, and he was amazed that an old coal plant a mile from his home still had no pollution controls; it was way dirtier than the new plants he was fighting around the country. The nation\u2019s fleet of existing coal plants was still emitting nearly 2 billion tons of carbon and causing an estimated 13,000 premature deaths every year. It felt good to stop projects that would have increased those numbers, but Nilles wanted to use the Club\u2019s newfound expertise to reduce them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to throw ourselves in front of bulldozers to stop something than it is to shut something down that\u2019s already part of the community, paying taxes, generating power, providing jobs,\u201d Nilles says. \u201cBut that\u2019s where the emissions are.\u201d\n\nThat was also the year Obama won the presidency, creating hope for stricter EPA regulation of sulfur, soot and ozone, plus the first-ever regulations of mercury, coal ash and carbon. As difficult as it would be to kill plants that had been operating for decades\u2014two-thirds of the coal fleet predated the Clean Air Act of 1970\u2014Nilles thought the combination of top-down rules from Washington and bottom-up pressure at state and local hearings could force utilities to confront investment decisions they had been delaying all those decades. Most utilities would need approval from their financial and environmental regulators before they could install expensive pollution controls. And while the utilities might be happy to charge their customers tens of millions of dollars for upgrades in order to comply with one new rule\u2014plus a tidy profit they\u2019re usually guaranteed for capital improvements\u2014utility commissions might not let them start down that road if they faced hundreds of millions of dollars in additional compliance costs from rules still to come.\n\nOnce again, the campaign produced some inspiring early wins, including the retirement of that antiquated plant near Nilles in Madison. He also filed a lawsuit against his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, to get it off coal. The Club quickly found that when it could stop investor-owned utilities from getting a blank check to charge ratepayers for coal upgrades, they would usually shut down the plants rather than risk shareholder dollars. That was even true in coal country, where homeowners, businesses and regulators were just as allergic to pricey upgrades\u2014and utilities were just as reluctant to foot the bill themselves. As Nilles\u2019 new deputy, Hitt, a West Virginia activist who had spent years trying to stop mining companies from blowing up mountains in Appalachia, found she could do more to protect the mountains by shutting down the plants that used their coal.\n\nBeyond Coal had grown from three staffers to a 15-state operation, but it still lacked the scale to fight 523 plants all over the country. It needed to get a lot bigger. That\u2019s when the combative billionaire who has financed his own wars on guns, tobacco and Big Gulps took an interest in the war on coal.\n\nBeyond Coal\u2019s pivotal moment came at a meeting in Gracie Mansion about, of all things, education reform. Michael Bloomberg, the Wall Street savant-turned media mogul-turned New York City mayor, was looking for a new outlet for his private philanthropy. It quickly became clear that education reform would not be that outlet.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible meeting in every way, and Mike was angry,\u201d recalls his longtime adviser, Kevin Sheekey. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, if you don\u2019t like this idea, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll bring you another.\u2019 He said: \u2018No, I want another now.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs it happened, Sheekey had just eaten lunch with Carl Pope, who was starting a $50 million fundraising drive to expand Beyond Coal\u2019s staff to 45 states. The cap-and-trade plan that Obama supported to cut carbon emissions had stalled in Congress, and the carbon tax that Bloomberg supported was going nowhere as well. Washington was gridlocked. But Pope had explained to Sheekey that shutting down coal plants at the state and local level could do even more for the climate\u2014and have a huge impact on public health issues close to his boss\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Bloomberg told Sheekey. \u201cWe\u2019ll just give Carl a check for the $50 million. Tell him to stop fundraising and get to work.\u201d\n\nBloomberg had never thought of himself as a Sierra Club kind of guy. But he saw coal as a killer, as well as the main threat to the climate, and the Club was in the field doing something about it. His only demand was a more analytical approach to the war on coal, with measurable deliverables, complex predictive models for vulnerable plants, and KPI\u2014Key Performance Indicators, as Pope later learned.\n\n\u201cThe Sierra Club had never heard of KPI,\u201d Pope says. \u201cWe just had a gut instinct for what would work. The mayor said: \u2018Oh, no, no. This will be data-driven.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn a sweltering day in July 2011, Bloomberg announced his gift to the Club on a boat he had chartered on the Potomac River, in front of a 63-year-old coal plant he had always noticed on flights into Washington. He saw it as a perfect illustration of the city\u2019s inability to get anything done.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think the politicians would at least care about the air they breathe themselves!\u201d Bloomberg marveled to me in a recent interview.\n\nThat plant on the Potomac is now closed. So is the Massachusetts plant that Mitt Romney once said \u201ckills people,\u201d a line Obama actually used against him in coal-state campaign ads in 2012. So are all of Chicago\u2019s plants, as Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted in his first campaign ad in 2015. Overall, the 190 plants that U.S. utilities have agreed to retire will eliminate about one fourth of America\u2019s coal-fired capacity, a total of 79 gigawatts. And for every watt of coal capacity they\u2019re taking out of commission, they\u2019ve already installed a watt of wind or solar capacity. The Clean Air Task Force estimate of coal-fired premature deaths is down to about 7,500 a year, a decrease of 5,500 since Beyond Coal went national. And Bloomberg\u2019s early support has helped attract more than $100 million from top foundations and wealthy individuals like the Silicon Valley billionaire Tom Steyer, the climate movement\u2019s top political donor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that you can do a lot with no help from Congress,\u201d Bloomberg says. \u201cI just wish we could point out the specific people who were saved.\u201d\n\nTo coal backers, Beyond Coal is pure urban elitist lunacy, the kind of nightmare you get when a nanny-state mayor from New York hooks up with eco-radicals from San Francisco and a liberal president in Washington. Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma\u2014chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, author of \u201cThe Greatest Hoax,\u201d thrower of a Senate-floor snowball designed to highlight the folly of global-warming alarmism\u2014told me it\u2019s hard to believe some Americans actually want to keep our abundant energy resources in the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war on all fossil fuels, and coal is the No. 1 target,\u201d Inhofe says. \u201cYou got a president who doesn\u2019t care how many jobs it costs, and rich people who don\u2019t care how much money they spend. They can do a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nI got to watch the war in Inhofe\u2019s state, and the damage wasn\u2019t getting done the way Inhofe imagined. The job creators were siding with the environmentalists. Economics was the most powerful weapon in the Sierra Club\u2019s arsenal.\n\nAt a dry hearing in a drab courtroom in Oklahoma City, a methodical Beyond Coal attorney named Kristin Henry, whose bio identifies her as \u201cone of the few environmentalists who would never be caught wearing Birkenstocks,\u201d was pinning down an Oklahoma Gas & Electric executive with a barrage of wouldn\u2019t-you-agrees, isn\u2019t-it-trues, and would-it-be-fair-to-say\u2019s. The power company was out of compliance with a federal air-quality rule called \u201cregional haze,\u201d so it was offering to convert one of its two coal plants into a natural gas plant. Henry knew she couldn\u2019t stop that. But OG&E also wanted to install massive new scrubbers on the other plant so it could keep burning coal for decades to come. Henry was determined to stop that.\n\nIn the 90 minutes Henry spent cross-examining OG&E\u2019s Joseph Rowlett in early March, she didn\u2019t ask a single question about climate or public health. She focused exclusively on OG&E\u2019s request for the largest rate increase in state history, a 15 percent hike to finance the utility\u2019s $700 million compliance plan. Through her deadpan, leading questions, she portrayed OG&E as a company desperate to get its customers to foot the bill to prop up an inefficient plant, pursuing retrofits it would never consider if its own shareholders had to swallow the costs, operating in a dream world where regional haze was coal\u2019s only challenge. At one point, she got Rowlett to admit his calculations assumed there would be no additional coal regulations for the next thirty years, even though the EPA intends to finalize at least four new coal regulations this year alone.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it true you\u2019re assuming zero over the next 30 years?\u201d Henry asked.\n\nRowlett paused a few seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe Sierra Club, even though it didn\u2019t sound much like the Sierra Club, was clearly in hostile political territory. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a conservative Republican who has spearheaded a national campaign to protect fossil fuels from legal challenges, had joined OG&E in fighting the EPA haze rule all the way to the Supreme Court. Now he was supposed to be representing consumers at the OG&E hearing before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, but he hadn\u2019t even filed a brief about the record rate hike. \u201cThat\u2019s unheard of,\u201d one commission official told me. Pruitt didn\u2019t attend the hearing, either\u2014the day it began, he was in Tulsa with Mike Huckabee raising money for his PAC\u2014but one of his deputies who did attend occasionally raised objections when OG&E witnesses were asked uncomfortable questions.\n\nBut if the political deck seemed stacked against the Sierra Club, Henry held the economic cards. In Oklahoma, coal imported from Wyoming now costs more per kilowatt hour than the abundant gas under the ground or the wind that famously comes sweeping down the plain. In another recent haze case, the Sierra Club cut a deal requiring Oklahoma\u2019s other major utility to phase out its only coal plant and buy 200 megawatts of wind\u2014and the bids came in so low, the utility ended up buying 600 megawatts of wind. That\u2019s why Wal-Mart, the hospital group and the coalition of industrial ratepayers all supported Beyond Coal\u2019s push for more wind in the OG&E case. Cheap electricity has a way of scrambling political alliances.\n\nHenry and the lawyers for OG&E\u2019s corporate customers formed a kind of tag team, taking turns blasting the company for refusing to even study new wind power. They repeatedly pointed out that in-state competitors as well as Florida and New Mexico utilities were buying Oklahoma wind for just 2 cents per kilowatt hour, even cheaper than coal without pollution controls, while OG&E hadn\u2019t purchased new wind in four years\u2014even though its ads boasted about its commitment to wind. When its witnesses claimed their transmission lines were too congested to add new wind, Henry produced internal documents suggesting the congestion could be fixed for about 3 percent of the cost of the new coal scrubbers. As she pointed out, other Oklahoma utilities have much higher percentages of wind power on their systems.\n\nClosing coal plants can sound radical, but Henry framed it for the Republican utility commissioners as the conservative response to EPA rules, avoiding the risk of \u201cstranded\u201d investments in outdated plants that might have to be shut down anyway. The most economical way to meet haze limits, she suggested, would be to stop burning the coal that causes the haze. Al Armendariz, who was Obama\u2019s Dallas-based regional EPA administrator and is now Beyond Coal\u2019s Austin-based regional representative, says the Club\u2019s victories in states like Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky have helped normalize the idea of abandoning coal in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cWe get respect because of our track record,\u201d Armendariz says. \u201cWhen we say a utility isn\u2019t acting prudently, people can\u2019t just dismiss us as \u2018Oh, of course the Sierra Club says that.\u2019 They see how we keep winning. They see these big industrial customers agreeing with us. Then they look at the numbers and see we\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s no denying the war on coal is leading America into uncharted territory. The Sierra Club wants to eliminate all coal power by 2030, but what will replace it? Wind and solar, despite their rapid Obama-era growth, still make up just 5 percent of U.S. power capacity. And while technologies to store renewable energy (such as Tesla\u2019s newly announced battery packs) are getting cheaper, they\u2019re still a rounding error on the grid. Beyond Coal\u2019s leaders are content to push cleaner power and let utilities figure out how to deliver it, but as OG&E Vice President Paul Renfrow told me: \u201cThat\u2019s easy for them to say. We have to keep the lights on.\u201d\n\nInhofe thinks the Sierra Club is simply obsessed with rooting out fossil fuels, citing \u201cthe guy who wants to crucify people\u201d as an example of its extremism. He meant Armendariz, who left the EPA after he was caught on tape suggesting that harsh sanctions for law-breaking oil and gas companies could scare others into compliance, just as public crucifixions helped keep the peace in Roman times.\n\n\u201cThe Sierra Club wants to stop coal now?\u201d Inhofe asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, they\u2019ll be after gas next.\u201d\n\nLong-term, he\u2019s right. While the Club accepted some donations from natural gas interests under Pope, it is now formally committed to eliminating gas as well as coal by 2030, and it has helped block new gas plants in cities like Austin and Carlsbad, California. After its victory last week in Asheville, Beyond Coal vowed to keep fighting to overturn Duke Energy\u2019s decision to build a new gas plant to replace its 50-year-old coal plant. Even Bloomberg thinks the Club\u2019s opposition to the fracking boom that has helped replace so much domestic coal with domestic gas is silly.\n\nThat said, Beyond Coal\u2019s leaders, including Armendariz, understand that Beyond Gas is more aspirational than practical for now. They deeply prefer renewables to gas, but they almost as deeply prefer gas to coal. In Oklahoma City, Henry grilled OG&E witnesses about why they wanted to spend $500 million on scrubbers for coal boilers that could be retrofitted to burn gas for just $70 million. She shredded the implausible assumptions OG&E had made in its economic models to make scrubbing coal look cheaper than converting to gas, forcing one witness to admit gas prices were already 25 percent lower than his low-cost scenario. I sat in on one friendly lunch the Club\u2019s legal team had with lawyers for a Conoco Phillips front group; they all hoped to move OG&E beyond coal, and gas is clearly part of the short-term solution.\n\nWhen Brune took over the Sierra Club in 2010, he halted the club\u2019s gas-industry gifts. | Getty\n\n\u201cWe want to be principled but pragmatic,\u201d says Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who stopped the Club\u2019s gas-industry gifts when he took over in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019ve wrestled with this, and there\u2019s a definite disagreement with Bloomberg. We don\u2019t see gas as an environmental fix. But we acknowledge that we still need some gas.\u201d\n\nCoal is different. Bloomberg calls it \u201ca dead man walking.\u201d When he made his initial gift to the Sierra Club, the goal was to secure the retirements of one third of the coal fleet by 2015. The Club is only slightly behind schedule, and in April, Bloomberg came to Washington to announce another $30 million donation, with a new goal of retirement announcements for half of the fleet by 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on an incredibly successful strategy,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s leaders believe coal has already passed a tipping point toward oblivion. Coal giants like Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal and Walter Energy are struggling to stay afloat. Just last week, in addition to the retirement announcement for the Asheville plant\u2014as well as another for a Milwaukee plant that wasn\u2019t official enough for Beyond Coal to count as #191\u2014the insurance giant AXA announced that it will sell off more than $500 million worth of coal investments, the largest financial institution to flee the space to date, while the EPA announced it was closing a loophole that allowed virtually unlimited emissions from malfunctioning coal plants, a response to yet another Sierra Club lawsuit. And the more dirty plants get shut down, the more residents near other dirty plants are asking: Why not ours?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to change the status quo, no matter how compelling the economic logic. Beyond Coal does not just deploy data. It organizes rallies and petitions and float-ins on kayaks; it shames utility executives on billboards and airplane banners; it mobilizes its members to show up at boring hearings where showing up can make a difference. If the Oklahoma City case displayed the war on coal as a numerical dispute, another hearing I watched south of Detroit was more like a street fight.\n\nRiver Rouge is a depressed community at the city\u2019s edge, a blightscape of boarded-up bungalows, overgrown lots and pawn shops. There\u2019s no grocery store and virtually no medical services, but there is a nice little park where kids play at the playground and adults fish in the Detroit River. Unfortunately, the park smells like rotten eggs, thanks to sulfur dioxide from a DTE Energy coal plant overlooking the playground. Michigan health officials have called this area \u201cthe epicenter of the state\u2019s asthma burden.\u201d The fish aren\u2019t safe to eat, either, though people eat them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an unhealthy situation,\u201d says Alisha Winters, a local resident and mother of seven children, two with asthma. \u201cThey figure they can get away with dumping on us.\u201d\n\nThe EPA has called out this area\u2019s elevated sulfur dioxide levels, and last year Republican Governor Rick Snyder\u2019s administration floated a compliance plan that would have required DTE to upgrade the coal-fired River Rouge Power Plant or (more likely) close it. But DTE proposed an alternative plan with no costly upgrades, and the state quietly accepted it. The Sierra Club has been mobilizing opposition ever since, drawing an unusual coalition of local whites, African-Americans, Latinos and Arab-Americans\u2014as well as a busload of white liberals from Ann Arbor\u2014for an environmental hearing in mid-March. The hearing had to be moved from City Hall to a school auditorium to accommodate the groundswell of protests, a far cry from that Chicago-area hearing over a decade ago where the Sierra Club got frozen out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting people to cross borders, physical and imaginary,\u201d says Rhonda Anderson, a sharecropper\u2019s daughter who is now an organizer for Beyond Coal.\n\nPlants that Beyond Coal helped shutter.

Bottom row: the Centralia Steam Plant, Washington; the Reid-Gardner power station, Nevada; the Crawford Generating Station, Chicago. | AP and Getty Images\n\nIf the Oklahoma City hearing was financial, the River Rouge hearing was political, a multiracial show of force in \u201cI Love Clean Air\u201d T-shirts. Every speaker opposed the DTE plan, including an Indian-American medical student, an Arab-American law student, an African-American asthma educator, a Latina anti-poverty activist and a white nun. Ebony Elmore, a child care provider who lives a block from the plant, talked about her four siblings and three nieces with asthma, as well as her two parents with pulmonary disease. I happened to ask Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who was watching the testimony from the side of the hall, why she was there, just as another resident started telling a story about an 11-year-old local girl who died because she couldn\u2019t get to her inhaler in time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Dingell whispered.\n\nA few days later, Governor Snyder\u2014whose top campaign supporters included one Michael Bloomberg\u2014announced a new effort to cut Michigan\u2019s reliance on coal. That would have been a huge political burden for Snyder if he had run for president in a GOP primary, where \u201canti-coal\u201d will be an epithet like \u201canti-gun\u201d or \u201canti-freedom,\u201d but he decided not to run, and coal is becoming a huge economic burden for his industrial state.\n\nThe already frenetic national pace of plant retirements will have to double for Beyond Coal to meet its 2017 goal, but utilities will face daunting investment decisions over the next two years. The EPA recently settled a sulfur lawsuit with the Sierra Club that could replicate the River Rouge dilemma across the nation. The agency has also imposed regional haze plans that already are replicating the Oklahoma dilemma in Arizona, Arkansas and Texas. Today, Beyond Coal has more than 100 legal cases pending over power supply. Meanwhile, it\u2019s pursuing a new strategy on the power demand side, pushing blue states like Oregon to stop importing coal-fired electricity, which could shutter plants in red states like Montana. Even inside Texas, the Club has worked with relatively progressive cities like Austin, San Antonio and El Paso to replace their coal power with renewables.\n\nBeyond Coal is also continuing to lobby and litigate in Washington, pushing Obama to drop his \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach to energy and formally enlist in the war on coal. Obama has not been as maniacally anti-coal as the industry suggests, punting on ozone rules in his first term to avoid alienating voters in Ohio, issuing relatively weak restrictions on coal ash, taking a lenient approach to mining on public land, floating carbon rules with mild targets for the most coal-reliant states. Still, when you add up all he\u2019s done and all he\u2019s doing, you get a tremendously uncertain regulatory environment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u2014whose wife, Elaine Chao, recently quit the Bloomberg Philanthropies board over coal\u2014has urged states to defy the Clean Power Plan, but utilities with fiduciary responsibilities don\u2019t engage in much civil disobedience. They have already shut down dozens of plants to comply with mercury rules the Supreme Court could still strike down, and they\u2019re starting to think about carbon, too.\n\nSome coal advocates still hold out hope that the decline can be reversed if Republicans can win the presidency and keep Congress. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a Congress that\u2019s sympathetic, but we\u2019ve still got a bureaucracy running amok,\u201d says Mike Duncan, the RNC chairman-turned-coal advocate. \u201cThat will play in 2016. Obviously, anytime you elect a leader, it\u2019s important to this industry.\u201d\n\nIf the EPA stands down under the next president, the pace of retirements could slow. But it probably won\u2019t stop. The trends are too strong. Nilles recently met with leaders of the utility Southern Company, which has slashed its dependence on coal in half over the past five years. Its executives rejected his vision of a coal-free America by 2030, but some of them suggested 2050 could be realistic. In any case, the Sierra Club won a lot of coal fights during the pro-coal Bush administration, because they were ultimately local fights over local air.\n\nThe fights also have a global context. The Earth is already getting hotter, and the death of American coal would not avert a climate catastrophe if the rest of the world did not follow our lead. But the decline of American coal emissions will help U.S. negotiators insist that other countries do their part in the global negotiations in Paris. And while critics of climate action often grumble that it would be foolish for the U.S. to make sacrifices when China is still building a new coal plant every week, that\u2019s no longer true. China actually decreased its coal use last year, and is shuttering all four plants in smog-shrouded Beijing. The trends killing coal in America\u2014cheap gas, wind and solar; more energy efficiency; stricter regulations\u2014are trending abroad as well. Cash-strapped U.S. mining firms are desperate to solve their domestic problems by selling more coal in foreign markets, but the Sierra Club has helped lead the fight to block six proposed coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest, which will help keep even more coal in the ground.\n\nThere will be no formal surrender in the war on coal, no battleship treaty to mark the end. But Beyond Coal\u2019s leaders believe they can finish most of their work setting the U.S. electric sector on a greener path over the next five years. The next phase of the war on carbon would be to try to electrify everything else\u2014cars and trains that use oil-derived gasoline and diesel, as well as homes and businesses that rely on natural gas and heating oil. Nilles hopes power companies like OG&E and DTE that Beyond Coal has spent the last decade fighting with\u2014but then cutting deals with\u2014can become allies in Phase Two. And allies will be vital, because if King Coal seems like a rich and powerful enemy, it\u2019s a pushover compared to Big Oil.\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve taken out coal, we\u2019ll need to take on oil, and who better to help than our new friends in the utility sector who can make money from electrification?\u201d Nilles says with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a long fight. This is how we win.\u201d\n\n",
