He added that one of the masked Antifa militants was `` approaching me while shaking a can of pepper spray . I wanted no part of whatever intentions they had for me so I immediately abandoned my camera duties and sprinted to safety . ''\nMillsap quickly encountered police decked out in riot gear at the city 's Justice Center \u2014 and one might assume that would 've taken care of his worries , as members of the brave Antifa mob stopped chasing him at that point but continued to yell at him , calling him a `` b * * * h . ''\nBut the cops had little sympathy for the video journalist , telling him if he goes back toward the Antifa mob , `` we 're not gon na come out and save you '' adding that `` you better come up with a different plan , like maybe go somewhere else , dude . ''\nPolice at least let Millsap get away from the Antifa mob by using a different route to the street \u2014 and the officer even suggested he `` skirt along the building so they do n't see you . ''\nWhen conservative journalist Andy Ngo picked up on the video , he asked Portland police to comment on the officer 's declaration that he would n't help Millsap , who was simply doing his job and exercising his right to shoot video of a public event .\nNgo said police wrote back to him , not answering his inquiry but saying `` just because an arrest is not made on the spot , it does not mean that an arrest wo n't be made in the future . ''\nConcluding his video description , Millsap noted that cops ' non-action on his behalf said loudly and clearly that `` masked thugs run the streets of Portland , Oregon , and if you are targeted by them , then you are the problem , according to Portland police . ''\nAmid the large Antifa gathering , police tweeted around 1 p.m. that `` lit flares '' were being thrown in the street and that `` several subjects '' were seen spray painting a monument within the park , KOIN-TV reported .\nSome of the protesters used `` metal-tipped umbrellas '' to jab `` people and chase them down the street , '' PPB said in a release .\nEarlier , a group of protesters pushed police while throwing oranges , a glass bottle , tennis balls , rock , concrete , batons , cans , and mud at the officers and other people .
