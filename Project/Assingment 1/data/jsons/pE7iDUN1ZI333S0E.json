Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign , Christine Peloza gave him $ 27 , the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run . Then , she kept giving , in $ 3 increments , clicking donate up to 20 times a day .\nBy the end of June , Mrs. Peloza , a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois , had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders , making her the most frequent contributor to any presidential campaign this year .\nMrs. Peloza is a standout example of a new trend in political fundraising . Instead of writing one large check to their preferred candidate , some donors are throwing them a few bucks dozens , or even hundreds , of times . Some repeat donors eventually pile up small contributions totaling $ 2,800 , the legal maximum for a federal election .\nA Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Election Commission data found that at least 1,900 people contributed 50 times or more to a single presidential candidate through the end of September . The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these \u201c super donors , \u201d the Journal found , with about 1,000 of them . The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers , led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who had at least 125 . And President Trump \u2019 s re-election campaign , which began in 2017 , has at least 250 .\nThe super donor trend is fueled by the increasing ease of giving money online\u2014sometimes by clicking a single button or through automated recurring payments\u2014and the premium that this year \u2019 s presidential candidates have placed on having a high volume of tiny donations , which they use as a proxy for grass-roots support .\nFrequent Funders The majority of super donors , who have donated 50 or more times to an indivdual candidate , gave to the Bernie Sanders campaign - especially at the end of fundraising quarters .

You have to get creative and work from the ground up . \u201d\nMessrs. Trump and Sanders stand apart from other 2020 candidates when it comes to high-frequency donors because they cultivated loyal fan bases during the 2016 presidential race . And the campaigns have perfected how to engage them , through emails , text messages and phone applications that ask for money , according to interviews with some of the most frequent givers .\nThe number of super donors , particularly for Mr. Trump , is likely higher than the Journal \u2019 s count because there is less public data available on the president \u2019 s donors than the Democratic candidates . That is because presidential campaigns only itemize donations when a donor hits the FEC \u2019 s $ 201 threshold requiring it . But ActBlue , the payment processor used by nearly all Democratic candidates , discloses information about all of its donors , including those who gave during the first half of the year . Mr. Trump began using a new Republican payment processor , which hasn \u2019 t yet filed a comprehensive public report .\nMr. Sanders \u2019 s campaign aides say his donors average three contributions apiece and that they have found repeat donors are more likely to become volunteers . \u201c We \u2019 re proud to have people who give what they can , when they can , \u201d said Tim Tagaris , a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and chief architect of Mr. Sanders \u2019 s 2016 digital fundraising program . \u201c It \u2019 s indicative of a campaign that has steady funding that can sustain for the long haul . \u201d\nWhile the campaigns are happy to have the cash flow in , the super donor phenomenon has at times created an accounting headache when it comes time to file their FEC reports . The campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have had to return money to supporters who went over campaign-contribution limits by donating many times in small increments . In total , Mr. Sanders refunded about $ 487,000 in contributions through the end of September , the FEC shows .\n\u201c I gave so much that the campaign recently cut me a check because I \u2019 d gone over the limit , \u201d said Trump donor Michael Burnham , 51 , who lives just outside Portland , Maine , and said the Trump campaign \u2019 s app is \u201c addictive. \u201d He has made at least 200 contributions to the re-election campaign , starting in January 2017 , FEC records show .\nOther donors say they have studied up on the best donation strategies .\nJohn Peloza at a Bernie Sanders rally in Chicago earlier this year .\nMrs. Peloza and her husband , John , supported Mr. Sanders during his 2016 run and knew they wanted to contribute again , as much as they legally could . Mr. Peloza , a 36-year-old steamfitter , has been a fan of the senator \u2019 s since catching a glimpse of him speaking on C-Span years ago and over time spread his enthusiasm to his wife , they said . They also volunteer for Mr. Sanders and promote him on social media and to their friends .\n\u201c He has a very well-established history of fighting for [ progressive ] policies because they are morally and ethically right , \u201d Mr. Peloza said .\nHe said he decided to give in larger chunks near the start of the campaign . Mrs. Peloza , meanwhile , said she thought it was important to show enthusiasm by showering the campaign with many small gifts . Part of why she did so , she said , was \u201c to balance out my husband \u2019 s much larger donations and provide a larger number of smaller donations to the campaign , \u201d she said .\nHer giving accelerated at key moments in the early part of the race , such as on April 25 , when former Vice President Joe Biden entered the race and became a competitor of Mr. Sanders . She gave 20 times that day .\nThe Journal \u2019 s analysis shows that Mr. Sanders \u2019 s frequent givers help run up the campaign \u2019 s donation totals at the end of each quarter ahead of FEC filing deadlines . Those contributors also give when the campaign sends out urgent fundraising appeals .\n\u201c I always donate around deadlines , \u201d said Ibrahim Jadoon , a 28-year-old professional education rights advocate in Richmond , Ky. Mr. Jadoon has contributed to Mr. Sanders more than 200 times , adding up to about $ 825 so far , FEC records show . He said he signed up to receive text messages from the campaign , uses its app and has saved his credit-card information with ActBlue , giving him the ability to donate with a single click .\nIbrahim Jadoon in Richmond , Ky. Mr. Jadoon has contributed to Mr. Sanders more than 200 times , adding up to about $ 825 so far , FEC records show .\n\u201c It would be really hard to find $ 2,800 on any one day , \u201d he said , \u201c or even $ 500. \u201d But giving here and there \u201c follows the Bernie vibe . It \u2019 s almost like , what can I do at the time ? \u201d\nThe Journal \u2019 s analysis found that Mr. Trump \u2019 s super donors gave in waves around events like the release of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and Democratic actions such as issuing subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry .\nHis most frequent donor , Richard DeRuyter , a 58-year-old former software engineer in southwest Missouri , has given more than 250 times to Mr. Trump \u2019 s re-election .\nMr. DeRuyter said he tends to give money whenever the Trump campaign sends a text or email promising to \u201c triple-match \u201d or \u201c quadruple-match \u201d money from donors . That is a common political fundraising strategy ; there is no evidence donations are actually \u201c matched , \u201d and the campaign didn \u2019 t respond to questions about it .\nJoseph Livi , a 69-year-old telephone-company retiree living near New Haven , Conn. , who has given more than 100 times to Mr. Trump \u2019 s re-election , said he gives \u201c when I think he needs a little reinforcement. \u201d He cited impeachment talks and media reports about Mr. Trump that he deems unfairly negative as reasons he has clicked the donate button .\n\u201c We \u2019 re giving not out of anger , but more like passion and angst , \u201d he said of his fellow donors to the president . \u201c We feel the injustice for him . \u201d",
