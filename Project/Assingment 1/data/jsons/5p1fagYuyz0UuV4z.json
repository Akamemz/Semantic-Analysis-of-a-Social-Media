    "content": "Former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg used prison labor to make campaign calls . Through a third-party vendor , the Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign contracted New Jersey-based call center company ProCom , which runs calls centers in New Jersey and Oklahoma . Two of the call centers in Oklahoma are operated out of state prisons . In at least one of the two prisons , incarcerated people were contracted to make calls on behalf of the Bloomberg campaign . According to a source , who asked for anonymity for fear of retribution , people incarcerated at the Dr. Eddie Warrior Correctional Center , a minimum-security women \u2019 s prison with a capacity of more than 900 , were making calls to California on behalf of Bloomberg . The people were required to end their calls by disclosing that the calls were paid for by the Bloomberg campaign . They did not disclose , however , that they were calling from behind bars .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t know about this and we never would have allowed it if we had . We don \u2019 t believe in this practice and we \u2019 ve now ended our relationship with the subcontractor in question . \u201d\nThe Bloomberg campaign confirmed the arrangement in an emailed statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We didn \u2019 t know about this and we never would have allowed it if we had , \u201d said Bloomberg spokesperson Julie Wood . \u201c We don \u2019 t believe in this practice and we \u2019 ve now ended our relationship with the subcontractor in question. \u201d The campaign said it did not know about the arrangement between ProCom and an undisclosed campaign vendor until \u2588\u2588\u2588 made its inquiry . The campaign then ended the relationship on Monday and said it has asked vendors to do a better job of vetting subcontractors in the future . \u201c The use of prison labor is the continued exploitation of people who are locked up , who really have virtually no other opportunities to have employment or make money other than the opportunities given to them by prison officials , \u201d said Alex Friedmann , managing editor of Prison Legal News and an advocate for incarcerated people \u2019 s rights .
