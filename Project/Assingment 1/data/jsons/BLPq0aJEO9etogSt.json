    "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 These young Chicago Cubs , most of them born in the 1990s , never did believe in curses , jinxes , spells or the gibberish that prevented their predecessors from winning a World Series .\nAnd when the rain started coming down just before the start of the 10th inning , almost midnight Wednesday in Game 7 of the World Series , it was the most beautiful sight they \u2019 ve ever seen .\nIt saved the Cubs from their worst collapse in franchise history , and perhaps the most painful winter any of them would ever endure , into the most beautiful evening of their lives .\nThe Cubs , for the first time in 108 years , at precisely 12:47 a.m . ET , were crowned World Series champions , ending the longest drought in sports history .\n\u201c We killed the curse , \u2019 \u2019 Cubs catcher Miguel Montero said . \u201c It \u2019 s done . It \u2019 s over . I can \u2019 t believe it .\nIn one of the most thrilling World Series games you \u2019 ll ever see , with the Cubs outlasting the Cleveland Indians , 8-7 , in 10 innings in Game 7 , they sent generations of fans into delirium , from Progressive Field in Cleveland to Wrigleyville .\n\u201c This one about made me pass out , \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 MVP Ben Zobrist said . \u201c It was just an epic battle . It was like a heavyweight fight , man . Just blow for blow , everybody playing their heart out .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t believe that we \u2019 re finally standing , after 108 years , finally able to hoist the trophy . \u2019 \u2019\nDavid Ross ' amazing exit : Cubs catcher homers , wins Game 7 , carried into retirement\nJason Heyward 's speech spurs Cubs during World Series Game 7 rain delay\nThe World Series trophy , still loitering in manager Joe Maddon \u2019 s office desk at 2 in the morning , surrounded by steak , lobster and bottles of red wine , will be on full display Friday when millions of fans will celebrate their long-awaited championship in downtown Chicago .\n\u201c For all of those leans years , these fans hung with us , \u2019 \u2019 says Cubs owner Tom Ricketts , who actually met his wife in the Wrigley bleachers . \u201c It was tough . When I think about what we did tonight , and everything we went through , I want to cry .\n`` You think about it , oh , my God , do you ever think about it . You think about the Cubs as a member of your family . Like all members of your family , you love them , but sometimes they let you down . And they might let you down for 108 years in a row .\n\u201c And we did . But I love the fact when a Cubs \u2019 fan walks into the office tomorrow , and someone asks when was the last time the Cubs won the World Series , they can say : 'yesterday . ' \u2019 \u2019\nAnd to think , the Cubs were so close to uttering that usual refrain , \u201c Wait \u2018 til Next Year , \u2019 until that rain started coming down , stopping the game for 17 minutes .\nThe delay gave them a chance to relax , compose themselves , while listening to right fielder Jason Heyward gather everyone in the weight room , giving one of the most impassioned speeches anyone ever heard .\n\u201c He told us whatever \u2019 s happened up to this point , \u2019 \u2019 Zobrist said , \u201c we 've got to forget about it . It 's over . We 're still the best team . We 're going to pull this thing out . We 're going to win this game .\n\u201c Most teams would have folded in that moment where we lost that lead , but hats off to J for making that moment happen , and kind of turning the page for us . ''\nSaid veteran Jon Lester , who pitched in relief for the first time since 2007 , delivering three strong innings : \u201c It was a big moment for us . It was a good meeting . He spoke up at the right time . \u2019 \u2019\nHeyward spoke passionately , reminding them of their talent , telling them they \u2019 ve come too far to lose now , with players like 22-year-old Addison Russell admitting later that he started crying .\nThey came back onto the field , produced a two-run rally started by the resilient Kyle Schwarber , with Zobrist and Montero hitting pay dirt with RBI hits , Zobrist 's double giving them the upper hand again .\nAnd then , they hung on for dear life , with Michael Martinez ending the game by hitting a soft grounder to third baseman Kris Bryant . He scooped it up , threw to first baseman Anthony Rizzo , and the Cubs and their fans rejoiced together , with grown men crying in the stands , and players almost too numb to move .\n\u201c I \u2019 m just exhausted from the emotions , \u2019 \u2019 said Cubs catcher David Ross , who became the oldest player to homer in a World Series game . \u201c I feel like we played for nine hours . To win a World Series in Chicago , a lot of teams have come through the Chicago Cubs \u2019 organization and weren \u2019 t able to do this , I couldn \u2019 t be more proud . \u2019 \u2019\nWhile the Cubs doused themselves with champagne , taking turns drenching actor Bill Murray ( \u201c I like the world we \u2019 re living in , the Cub world \u2019 \u2019 ) , while Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder ( \u201c I \u2019 m speechless , how beautiful is this \u2019 \u2019 ) , serenaded the crowd , it was the precipitation from the sky that everyone was talking about all night .\n\u201c I think the rain delay was the best thing that ever happened to us , \u2019 \u2019 Cubs GM Jed Hoyer said , \u201c to be honest with you . Things had kind of stopped going in our direction .\n\u201c I think that delay allowed our guys to regroup . And maybe , after 108 years , you get some divine intervention . \u2019 \u2019\nHow the Cubs erased a 3-1 deficit to win the World Series\nIt was Heyward , their $ 184 million player who struggled all season , who was the ring leader . It was the first time he ever called an entire team meeting . He wasn \u2019 t sure what quite prompted him to talk , but knew something was needed .\nThe Cubs were four outs away from winning the World Series in conventional style , leading 6-3 in the eighth inning , when Brandon Guyer lined a run-scoring double , bringing up Rajai Davis .\nDavis , sitting on a 2-and-2 fastball from closer Aroldis Chapman , sent the ball into the left field seats for a two-run homer . For the first time all evening , since Cubs leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler became the first player to lead off Game 7 with a homer , the game was tied , at 6-apiece .\nThe stadium was bedlam , with Cavs star LeBron James jumping up and down in his suite , high-fiving everyone around him .\nChapman , now trying to compose himself , gave up a single to Coco Crisp , struck out Yan Gomes for the final out , walked over to the dugout bench .\n\u201c Everybody wants to do their job , \u2019 \u2019 Chapman said . \u201c It didn \u2019 t work out the way I expected . I got hit around . \u2019 \u2019\nTeammates came over to console him , and he was hoping for another chance to close it out when Heyward reached third base with one out . Javy Baez botched a safety squeeze for the second out . Fowler then hit what appeared to be a go-ahead single , only for Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor to race far to his left , and throw him out from short left field .\nChapman , who had been used for 20 pitches in Game 6 to protect a five-run lead , mowed down the heart of the Indians \u2019 order in the bottom of the ninth , and then came the rains .\n\u201c When they pulled the tarp , \u2019 \u2019 Heyward said , \u201c I was like , \u201c We need to talk . We need to get together. \u2019 I told them , \u201c You \u2019 re awesome . Don \u2019 t get down . I had to remind them how good they are . How special they are .\n\u201c At that moment , I just had to vent a little bit . I was a little heated . It was a tough situation to overcome . I told them that we won 103 games . We overcame adversity all year . Let \u2019 s keep that fire . Here we are boys , let \u2019 s reset , and let \u2019 s go do this thing . \u2019 \u2019\nIt wasn \u2019 t exactly trainer Mickey Goldmill screaming at Rocky Balboa , or even David Ortiz passionately speaking to his Boston Red Sox teammates during the 2013 World Series , but , oh , did it ever do the trick .\n\u201c It was the best rain delay of all time , \u2019 \u2019 Rizzo said . \u201c You never , ever , want a rain delay , but it was the best . It kind of settled us down , and got us regrouped . \u2019 \u2019\nSaid Heyward : \u201c We didn \u2019 t know what was going to happen , but I knew we were ready to do what we did . We had new life . \u2019 \u2019\nThe next thing anyone knew , Rizzo was catching that ball from Bryant , stuffing the most famous ball in Cubs \u2019 history , into his back pocket , and the celebration was on .\n\u201c I threw the ball , \u2019 \u2019 Bryant said , laughing . \u201c Give me the ball . But he was joking about it for the last week . He said , \u201c If I get the last out , I \u2019 m keeping the ball , because that \u2019 s going to be worth a lot of money . \u2019 \u2019\n\u201c These guys are so young , \u2019 \u2019 said Lester , \u201c I don \u2019 t think they \u2019 ll understand it until they \u2019 re a little older .\n\u201c But I understand .
