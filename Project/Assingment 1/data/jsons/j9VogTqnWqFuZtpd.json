But how many it will ultimately help remains to be seen .\nThe uproar over the cancellations has ensnared the White House for weeks , shining a spotlight on Obama 's previous promise that people who liked their insurance plans can keep them .\n`` This fix wo n't solve every problem for every person . But it 's going to help a lot of people , '' the president said at the White House .\nBut the fix , as reported earlier by CNN 's Dana Bash , puts the onus of the renewals outside the president 's control : The administration is not requiring insurers or state insurance commissioners to extend the existing plans , but instead is letting them offer an additional year of coverage .\nAlso , insurers must notify policyholders of the difference in benefits between their policies and the Obamacare plans available on the insurance exchanges . And the companies must inform people that additional policies are available on the exchanges and that subsidies may be available to those who qualify .\nNot everyone who has received a cancellation notice , however , may be able to extend .\nSince insurance is regulated at the state level , it remains up to the commissioners to permit the extensions and the companies to do so . The president noted that not all commissioners may agree to extensions . At least four states -- California , Idaho , Virginia and Kentucky -- are requiring all individual plans adhere to Obamacare rules .\nThe insurance industry said the reversal could cause major problems , including a hike in premiums if fewer younger and healthier people opt to buy in the exchanges .\n`` Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers , '' said Karen Ignagni , chief executive of America 's Health Insurance Plans , an industry trade group. `` Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace and mitigate the adverse impact on consumers . ''\nIn his remarks , Obama said he did n't want his signature policy to be the reason people are losing their insurance .\n`` The key point is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who receive these notices , look , you know , I , the president of the United States , and the insurance -- the insurance model of the Affordable Care Act -- is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have , '' he said .\nBut he also stressed that the reason for health reform is that the current system did not work well , and that Americans will be able to find better quality insurance on the exchanges .\n`` It 's important that we do n't pretend that somehow that 's a place worth going back to , '' he said , of the existing individual market . `` Too often , it works fine , as long as you stay healthy . It does n't work well when you 're sick . ''\nAlso , in announcing the changes Thursday , Obama apologized for the rough start to enrollment in the federal and state exchanges .
