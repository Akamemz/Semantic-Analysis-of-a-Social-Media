    "content": "As early as 2013 , the F.B.I . had concerns about Paul Manafort and his deputy , Rick Gates , regarding their \u201c offshore consulting activities , \u201d and interviewed the pair repeatedly . At the time , Manafort was working for Ukrainian President ( and Putin puppet ) Viktor Yanukovych , from whom he allegedly received more than $ 12 million in secret payments .\nThe bureau also had long been interested in Carter Page , an obscure energy consultant whom it had first interviewed in 2013 in connection to his contacts with Victor Podobnyy , a Russian spy based in New York . Page \u2019 s chief distinction was his willingness to recite Kremlin talking points on foreign policy .\nManafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 . Page was named to Trump \u2019 s foreign policy team that same month . So was George Papadopoulos , another nonentity with pro-Russian views . Within two months , Papadopoulos was getting word of Russia \u2019 s hacking ops via a Kremlin-connected source , which he passed along to former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer that May . The Australians later related this to the F.B.I .\nRetired Gen. Mike Flynn , the future national security adviser , had his own financial ties to Russian companies and organizations that would stand to benefit from the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia . Flynn \u2019 s sudden advocacy for lifting sanctions was especially odd given that he was previously on record as an anti-Russia hawk .\nAll of this is independent of Christopher Steele \u2019 s notorious Russia dossier . Some pundits on the right are now breathlessly trying to claim that the bureau was spying on Page , and thus the campaign , via an informant before the formal investigation began , as if this is an outrage of the first order .\nBut the significant question is whether any competent counterintelligence officer would not have seen , in this constellation of facts , serious reason to believe that the Trump campaign was profoundly vulnerable to Russian manipulation , even ( or especially ) if the candidate himself didn \u2019 t know about it . Just imagine if Manafort or Flynn hadn \u2019 t had their Russia ties exposed and now occupied positions of trust in the White House . The Kremlin would surely know how to leverage their secrets .",
