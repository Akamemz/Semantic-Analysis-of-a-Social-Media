The party leaves this steamy city itching to beat President Barack Obama, finally accepting its new standard-bearer after his emotional acceptance speech and feeling a sense of comfort that its future could rest in the hands of two of this week\u2019s stars: Ryan and Rubio.\n\nThey leave more confident that Romney has a fall fight in him, and he certainly tried hard to win them over. He gave them a greater sense of his story, delivered powerfully through movies, testimonials, his wife\u2019s address and his own Thursday night, in which he choked up at times, and at others brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n( PHOTOS: Scenes from the RNC)\n\n1. Romney opened up\n\nIn a speech that was heavier than normal on biography, the candidate accepted his nomination by talking about the \u201cdisappointment\u201d of Obama\u2019s tenure, the desperate need for corrective action this election, and the promises the president made that weren\u2019t met.\n\nThe speech was largely an expanded version of his stump address, but it was well-written, and well-delivered. He performed as well as he has this cycle. Even Romney\u2019s detractors in the party said they thought he turned in a strong enough performance to help himself with voters just tuning in, and those beyond the GOP base. The nominee talked about his father in familiar terms to those who\u2019ve watched his speeches, but with genuine emotion, his voice catching at times.\n\nThe former Bain Capital head touted his business experience at length, before a televised audience of millions.\n\nRomney has tended toward the \u201cin sorrow, not anger\u201d approach toward Obama for much of the cycle, and he went there again last night, after recently using words like Obama\u2019s campaign of \u201chate\u201d and \u201canger\u201d in to characterize the president.\n\nRomney\u2019s best line of the night claimed that the most excitement surrounding Obama came on the day people voted for him. He hit a recurring line among Republicans for the past year, that Obama is Jimmy Carter 2.0. He did touch on the Medicare issue, albeit in passing.\n\nTopics he did not deal with \u2014 his Massachusetts record, the state-based health care plan he pushed through, the war in Afghanistan.\n\nRomney is not a naturally gifted speaker, and selling himself has remained a struggle. The expectations were low, but he did a commanding job on the convention\u2019s final night.\n\nThe commentary in the next few days will determine whether he was able to change the arc of a campaign that\u2019s seen a very rough July and August. Romney will likely get criticized by Democrats and some commentators for a lack of specifics - he outlined a contrasting governing philosophy with the incumbent. And in the short term, he may indeed see a bump.\n\n2. Rubio electrified.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s speech introducing Romney was among the best-received of the convention, as he delivered an emotional punch in a different way than Ryan did the night before. He told an aspirational story about his upbringing as a Cuban-American, speaking about his experience as deeply grounded in the American experience.\n\nHe described Romney as the best person to reclaim American exceptionalism, and framed much of the beginning of his speech as an attack on Obama. Other than the distraction of the red, lava lamp-like background behind Rubio, he was a success, and his speech played well on television.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Marco Rubio thrills RNC on final night)\n\nIt\u2019s a little less clear how Clint Eastwood, the convention\u2019s surprise guest who preceded Rubio, played on the small screen. The aging actor, his voice at times garbled, ad-libbed and riffed with a stool next to him, improvising an odd conversation with an imaginary Obama.\n\nHe can safely claim the title of first prime-time speaker at a political convention to lead the crowd in a chorus of, \u201cGo ahead, make my day.\u201d\n\nThe Romney family semmed less than thrilled when the camera panned to them, and the campaign made a game attempt at describing the actor as beyond the bounds of normal political discourse.
