    "content": "Senate Democrats filibustered the Keystone XL pipeline on Tuesday , in a vote that reverberated from Louisiana , where a key senator \u2019 s career is now likely doomed , to the broader national Democratic Party , where environmentalists have emerged triumphant in a divisive internal battle with labor unions .\nThe Keystone vote took on symbolism far beyond the small impact on American crude supplies and the slight effect expected on gas prices . Environmentalists drew lines and dared moderate and conservative Democrats to cross it . In the end , most were unwilling to defy the ascendant movement , and it marked a key moment in the climate change debate .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time to make this turn . And there \u2019 s no better moment to make this turn than on this pipeline that would bring the filthiest fuel in the planet into circulation , \u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat .\nThe vote fell one shy of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster , with 14 Democrats joining all 45 Republicans in backing the project .\nIn the near term , the vote means President Obama gets to avoid a difficult decision on whether to veto the bill . But Senate Republicans said he shouldn \u2019 t get too comfortable because they will pass a new version as soon as they take control of the chamber next year .\nBased on Tuesday \u2019 s vote and Senate balance next year , Republicans should have enough support to overcome a Democratic filibuster but not enough to override a presidential veto .\nMr. Obama refused to say whether he would veto this year \u2019 s bill , though he sounded skeptical when he spoke to reporters over the weekend . He said Congress should give him leeway to make a decision on his own .\nTraditional blue-collar labor unions , though , desperately sought the pipeline \u2019 s approval , saying it was a test of whether the Democratic Party could be trusted on jobs .\n\u201c The majority of Democrats in the Senate and the White House just don \u2019 t get it , even though the recent election results surely should have sunk in by now . They have lost their way , their purpose and their base , \u201d said Laborers \u2019 International Union of North America President Terry O \u2019 Sullivan .\nState Department officials have been delaying a decision for years , trying to decide whether to approve the final permit that would allow the pipeline to cross the international boundary between Canada and the U.S. , bringing crude from the oil deposits in the tar sands of Alberta to refineries in the U.S .\nThe pipeline is also awaiting action by courts and permitters in Nebraska , where some residents have challenged its proposed path . They say the pipeline would threaten critical natural habitat .\nThe Senate vote proved to be dramatic , chiefly because it wasn \u2019 t clear what the outcome would be .\nVote counters said over the weekend that Sen. Mary L. Landrieu , the Louisiana Democrat who pushed for the vote , was just shy of the support she needed \u2014 though she was optimistic .\nHer re-election bid is now likely doomed . Ms. Landrieu was already struggling to unify her party and eat into Republican support , and the pipeline , which she set up as a test of her leadership , backfired .\nIndeed , the comparison with her Republican opponent , Rep. Bill Cassidy , is striking . Mr. Cassidy was the sponsor of the House version of the Keystone bill , which cleared the lower chamber last week in a bipartisan vote .\nHer fellow Democrats did their best to defend Ms. Landrieu during the floor debate , praising her efforts even as they prepared to filibuster her bill and defeat her chief case for re-election .\n\u201c Without Mary Landrieu , we would not be having this debate , \u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer , chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , who led opposition to her fellow Democrat .\nAn emotional Ms. Landrieu stood in the well and watched as her colleagues voted and likely sealed her fate back home .\nAfterward , she told reporters she resented both sides trying to play politics with the issue and said she believed she had forced the issue onto the agenda thanks to her seniority in the Senate .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no blame . There \u2019 s only joy in the fight , \u201d Ms. Landrieu said .\nAnalysts said the vote was everything from a statement on U.S.-Canada relations to a proxy for where Congress stands on climate change and the future of fossil fuels in the economy . Some also said it hinted at a battle within Senate Democrats \u2019 ranks over whom they wanted to be the next top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and , more broadly , over which wing will control the Democratic Party going forward .\n\u201c The totemic nature of it can \u2019 t be avoided , \u201d said Michael McKenna , a Republican energy lobbyist . \u201c It \u2019 s essentially a choice between Mary Landrieu and Maria Cantwell , between [ Senate Majority Leader ] Harry Reid and [ West Virginia \u2019 s Sen. ] Joe Manchin , if you want to think of it that way .
