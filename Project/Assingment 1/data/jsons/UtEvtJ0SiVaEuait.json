    "content": "All 10 U.S. Navy sailors detained by Iran after drifting into its territorial waters a day earlier have been freed , the U.S. and Iran said Wednesday .\nThe Navy said the American crew members returned safely and there were no indications they had been harmed while in custody .\nThe nine men and one woman were held at an Iranian base on Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf after they were detained nearby on Tuesday . The tiny outpost has been used as a base for Revolutionary Guard speedboats as far back as the 1980s .\nThe sailors departed the island at 0843 GMT aboard the boats they were detained with , the Navy said . They were picked up by Navy aircraft and other sailors took control of their boats for the return voyage to Bahrain , where the U.S. 5th Fleet is based .\nThe Navy added that it `` will investigate the circumstances that led to the sailors ' presence in Iran . ''\nThe Revolutionary Guard 's official website published images of the detained U.S. sailors before their release , showing them sitting on the floor of a room . They look mostly bored or annoyed , though at least one of the sailors appears to be smiling . The sole woman had her hair covered by a brown cloth . The pictures also showed what appeared to be their two boats .\n`` After determining that their entry into Iran 's territorial waters was not intentional and their apology , the detained American sailors were released in international waters , '' a statement posted online by the Guard said Wednesday .\nUS Vice President Joe Biden says that America did not apologize to Iran over U.S. sailors allegedly entering Iranian territorial waters .\nBiden made the comments Wednesday in an interview with `` CBS This Morning . ''\nThe vice president said : `` There 's nothing to apologize for . When you have a problem with the boat you apologize the boat had a problem ? No , and there was no looking for any apology . This was just standard nautical practice . ''\nBiden said that the Iranians realized the U.S. sailors `` were there in distress and said they would release them and released them like ordinary nations would do . ''\nGen. Ali Fadavi , the navy chief of Iran 's powerful Revolutionary Guard , was quoted earlier Wednesday by Iranian state TV as saying that an investigation had shown the Americans entered Iranian territorial waters because of `` mechanical problems in their navigation system . ''\nU.S. officials also blamed mechanical trouble for the incident . They had said on Tuesday that Tehran assured them the crew and vessels would be returned safely and promptly .\nFadavi said the American boats had shown `` unprofessional acts '' for 40 minutes before being picked up by Iranian forces after entering the country 's territorial waters . He said Tehran did not consider the U.S. Navy boats violating Iranian territorial waters as an `` innocent passage . ''\nThe sailors were nonetheless allowed to make contact with the U.S. military , based on Iran 's `` responsibilities and Islamic mercy '' late Tuesday , he said .\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , who forged a personal relationship with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif during the three years of nuclear negotiations , called his Iranian counterpart immediately on learning of the incident , according to a senior U.S. official . Kerry `` personally engaged '' with Zarif on the issue , said the official , who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly .\nKerry said in a statement Wednesday : `` That this issue was resolved peacefully and efficiently is a testament to the critical role diplomacy plays in keeping our country safe , secure and strong . ''\nKerry has a close relationship with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif after the recent nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and world powers .\nKerry learned of the incident around 12:30 p.m. EST as he and U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter were meeting their Filipino counterparts at the State Department , the official said .\nFadavi said Zarif `` had a firm stance '' during the telephone conversation with Kerry about the sailors ' presence in Iran 's territorial waters and `` said they should not have come and should apologize . ''\nCarter said he was pleased with the sailors ' release and he thanked Kerry for his diplomatic efforts . `` Around the world , the U.S. Navy routinely provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress , and we appreciate the timely way in which this situation was resolved , '' Carter said .\nThe Guard 's 200,000-strong force is different from the regular Iranian military and is charged with protecting the ruling system . Its naval forces are heavily dependent on armed speedboats that can be used in teams to swarm much larger vessels .\nThe incident came amid heightened tensions with Iran , and only hours before President Barack Obama gave his final State of the Union address to Congress and the public .
