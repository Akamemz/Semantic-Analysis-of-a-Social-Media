    "content": "Nobody expected a whole lot of excitement from the first Democratic debate , and it delivered .\nThe decorous Las Vegas session was a pillow fight compared with those laugh-riot Donald Trump Republican melees . The reason : None of the five Democrats , especially Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders , were particularly inclined to savage each other , and there wasn \u2019 t much daylight between them on the issues even if they were in a more bellicose mood .\nClinton , a skilled and aggressive debater , was way more comfortable on the stage than during all those awful , forced-march email interviews and server-centric press conferences . But she had help . Her challengers , especially Sanders , were more intent on proving they belonged on the stage next to her than trying to knock her off of it .\nIf Joe Biden was waiting for signs of a Hillary Clinton collapse to coax him into the 2016 race , he should have shut off Tuesday \u2019 s debate and watched the baseball playoffs .\n1 . Hillary awakens ! Maybe it was stepping outside herself to become Val the Bartender on `` SNL '' that got the infamously tightly wound front-runner out of her own head \u2014 but the woman who won 18 million Democratic primary votes in \u2019 08 finally looked like a winner for the first time this year . For all her happy talk of adoring peach-pie interactions with adoring rope-line supporters in Ames , Clinton has always run best for president in grander , more overtly presidential environments . Before Tuesday , her most impressive performance took place in front of an elite D.C. audience at Brookings when she defended the Iran deal last month . This was a bigger stage , one befitting her status , and she projected a waking-from-a-nightmare vibe , comfortable enough to take a few swings at Sanders in the forceful but smooth senatorial way she perfected in two dozen solid debate performances against Barack Obama .\nLike a tourist from Brooklyn bragging about his own blackjack system , Sanders crowed about not overpreparing for Vegas \u2014 and was walloped by the house during the first hour : When the Vermont independent praised the health care systems of Denmark and Norway , Clinton sensed a Debate 101 opening . \u201c I love Denmark , \u201d she snarked . \u201c We are not Denmark . We are the United States of America . \u201d\nClinton may not get a bump in the polls , but she flat-out won the debate . Which raises the question : Why , oh why , did she lobby to limit the number of debates to six ?\n2 . Bernie gave her a free pass . The indisputable signature moment of the debate came about halfway through when Sanders , in the unaffected style that has won him so many admirers , expressed what seemed to be a heartfelt sentiment that ran counter to his own interests . \u201c The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails , \u201d Sanders declared , after Clinton tried ( with limited success ) to divert the inevitable email interrogation into an attack on the Republican-steered House Benghazi committee .\nClinton reacted to her gallows reprieve with undisguised relief . She smiled from ear to ear and grabbed Sanders \u2019 hand \u2014 a cheerful reversal of Rick Lazio \u2019 s infamous attempt to invade her podium personal space during a 2000 Senate debate . \u201c Thank you , Bernie , \u201d she said to thunderous applause . Sanders might yet have the last laugh : Clinton may have dodged a grilling among her fellow Democrats \u2014 but he came off as a magnanimous mensch , not the old , scolding uncle many Clinton backers have painted him to be .\n3 . O \u2019 Malley was the odd man out . No serious candidate ( with the exception of Scott Walker ) has underperformed quite as dramatically as former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley , who is registering low single digits everywhere \u2014 including his home state . It wasn \u2019 t that he was bad on Tuesday night ; he just slipped through the cracks , a liberal candidate trapped between an electrifying socialist and an increasingly progressive Clinton . The fact that the Democrats agree , in general terms , on virtually every policy area ( there \u2019 s no comparable split , for instance , on immigration reform as there is in the GOP field ) left O \u2019 Malley with precious little to differentiate himself from Clinton and Sanders . Add to that a bland delivery and lack of laugh lines \u2014 and there \u2019 s little reason to believe O \u2019 Malley revived his flagging candidacy .\n4 . A Trump-less debate is a smarter debate . Say what you want about the Democrats , they are a wonk pack . If you want two hours of personal combat with extended exchanges about The Donald \u2019 s hair , Carly Fiorina \u2019 s face , Rand Paul \u2019 s height or Jeb Bush \u2019 s testosterone levels , tune into the next GOP debate in a couple of weeks . If you had a hankering for the finer points of drug sentencing laws , the relative merits of Glass-Steagall vs. Dodd-Frank or the details of Clinton \u2019 s college tuition plan , this was the debate for you .\nThe civility of the discourse was also smart politics : Polls show that a vast majority of Democrats , even those who question her trustworthiness , are still broadly supportive of Clinton and are turned off by the kind of unrestricted verbal combat that has made the Republican scrums must-see TV .\n5 . Clinton did OK on emails \u2014 Wall Street , not so much . If Sanders was willing to give Clinton a pass on her scandals , he laser-focused on the issue at the core of his appeal to anti-establishment Democrats : economic inequality and sundry abuses of the financial services industry . \u201c Congress does n't regulate Wall Street . Wall Street regulates Congress , '' Sanders said . `` Saying \u2018 please do the right thing \u2019 is kind of naive . ''\nSanders , allying himself with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , has called for the breakup of the biggest banks to avoid the unfair centralization of capital and another financial crisis ; he \u2019 s been outspoken in opposing the appointment of Wall Street officials to the Treasury Department and regulatory agencies . Clinton has called for tighter regulation but doesn \u2019 t back the bank breakup \u2014 and she took substantial speaking fees from major Wall Street firms , including more than $ 600,000 from Goldman Sachs .\nCompared with Sanders \u2019 battle cry , Clinton \u2019 s rhetoric seemed tepid and reactive . `` I represented Wall Street when I was a senator from New York , '' she said . `` I went to Wall Street and said , 'Cut it out . ' '' Not exactly pitchforks .\n6 . Sanders can \u2019 t handle a gun . The Clinton campaign knew Sanders would out-Warren them on Wall Street \u2014 so they sprung a trap on the Brooklyn-bred Vermonter on guns , specifically his five votes in opposition to the Bill Clinton-backed Brady bill in the early 1990s when Sanders was a congressman . For once , Clinton had a force multiplier \u2014 Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley , whose super PAC has already run anti-Sanders ads , criticizing the votes . The two squeezed Sanders , whose broader appeal rests on his honesty and authenticity , as he stammered and squirmed .\nHe seemed unprepared : He said something about representing a \u201c rural state , \u201d then called a recent vote against holding gun manufacturers liable for violence \u201c large and complicated . \u201d\nClinton scowled . \u201c I was in the Senate at the same time , \u201d she shot back . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t that complicated to me . \u201d\n7 . Chafee and Webb were subatomic . Nobody expected Lincoln Chafee , who somehow managed to register a single percentage point in recent polls , to make much noise . The sole exception was his explanation for voting against a key bank-regulation bill when serving in the Senate as a Republican from Rhode Island : He said he was too much of a newbie to know better \u2014 and was grieving over his father \u2019 s death at the time .\nFormer Virginia Sen. Jim Webb , a former Navy secretary known for his way with words , whined endlessly about not getting enough mic time \u2014 then proceeded to meander through the questions he was asked . His one memorable moment came when moderator Anderson Cooper asked the candidates which enemies they were most proud of making . Clinton nailed it by answering \u201c the Iranians \u201d and \u201c Republicans . \u201d\nWebb , a glowering , muscle-bound presence at the end of the stage , responded with a chilling story about his tour in \u2018 Nam . \u201c I \u2019 d have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me , but he \u2019 s not around right now to talk , \u201d he said to nervous laughter in the hall .",
