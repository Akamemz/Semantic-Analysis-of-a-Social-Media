    "content": "Ten years into the recovery , the economy 's ability to create new jobs may be slowing , both because the U.S. is running out of workers and because the trade war may be worrying employers .\nEconomists expect to see 165,000 jobs were added in June , after a stunningly low 75,000 payrolls added in May , according to Dow Jones . But a soft ADP report Wednesday , with just 102,000 new private payrolls , dampened expectations for the government 's June payroll report , which will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m . ET .\nThe jobs report is also seen as a major input for the Fed to consider when it meets at the end of the month , and if there is more weakness than expected in job growth or wages data , it could be another catalyst for an expected interest rate cut . In the June report , the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6 % , while average hourly wages are expected to increase by 0.3 % , or 3.2 % year over year , up from 3.1 % in May .\n`` We 've known for a while with a very low unemployment rate that we 're running out of workers . Payroll gains are going to slow at some point . I do n't know if this is the point or not . I do n't trust the ADP number . I do n't know if the day of seeing 200,000 job numbers is over , '' said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank .\nADP is not seen as a strong indicator for the government 's employment report , but in May , its initial report of just 27,000 , later revised to 40,000 jobs , sent a strong message about a hiring slowdown that later showed up in the government 's weak May report .\nOn the other hand , some employment indicators remain strong . Weekly jobless claims data , viewed as the most current data on the labor market , fell by 8,000 to 221,000 in late June , signaling a solid enough jobs picture when it was released Wednesday .\nBut ADP 's data also contained some worrisome details , such as the decline of 37,000 jobs in companies employing one to 19 people . `` The thing that 's really puzzling is the slowdown in small business hiring . That 's really the engine for job growth in the economy . Seeing that slowdown is concerning , '' said Tom Simons , money market economist at Jefferies .\nSo far , it 's not clear how much employers are holding off on hires because they are fearful about an economic slowdown or because of uncertainty about trade or tariffs . But other data , showing slower manufacturing activity and weaker investment spending , has been a concern .\n`` Certainly , it would be a problem if jobs were weak for a second month in a row . For the Federal Reserve , they 're certainly worried and teed up to cut rates on July 31 . Any weakness in payrolls for a second month would be a virtual green light for a Fed rate cut , '' said Rupkey . `` It 's not going to be shocking for the market . ... But is the economy really ready to go into a tailspin with an actual downturn here ? It just does n't feel like it . Consumer spending is still high . ''\nBut the average hourly wage number inside Friday 's report could also be a factor for the Fed , especially if it 's shy of expectations .\n`` Expectations are for a deceleration in job growth . Job growth is decelerating quite sharply from 2018 . The real issue for the Fed is what 's wage growth , and it 's not been promising of late , '' said Diane Swonk , chief economist at Grant Thornton . `` We 've seen 3.1 % after hitting a peak of 3.4 % . If we stay in that 3 % range , that 's enough for the doves at the Fed to go . The question is can they bring the hawks along with them . They 're really going to be looking at the wage number . ''\nMoody 's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said he expects 135,000 jobs were added in June and that the report will show both a lack of workers and the impact of trade wars and tariffs on the economy . The ADP report is published in collaboration with Moody 's . Zandi said the ADP report reflects just private sector hires , and he expects a surge in government workers in June .\n`` I think the trade war is causing real damage . We were going to see some slowdown anyway because we were not going to be able to fill these open positions . This feels like it 's more than that . We went from a monthly gain of 225,000 last year to 165,000 , and the recent numbers suggest we could be at 125,000 to 150,000 . That 's more than can be explained than that people ca n't find workers , '' said Zandi .\nAt J.P. Morgan , economists are expecting a below-consensus 140,000 jobs in June .\n`` We are watching the different labor market reports for information about how the job market is responding to recent news on trade policy and other economic developments . While there have been occasional worrisome readings , overall it looks like the trend in job growth is cooling , but not in an especially severe way . We continue to forecast that Friday 's BLS report will show nonfarm job growth of 140,000 in June , '' wrote economist Daniel Silver .",
