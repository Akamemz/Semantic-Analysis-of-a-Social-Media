    "content": "Conservative Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh embarked on a round of courtesy calls Tuesday with key Republican senators who control his Supreme Court nomination , while frustrated Democrats argued for a postponement of the confirmation hearing until special counsel Robert Mueller completes the Russia investigation that they hope could damage President Trump .\nA day after Mr. Trump nominated the D.C . Circuit federal appeals court judge to replace retiring Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , the nominee made the traditional first visit to Capitol Hill , where he met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican . He was escorted by Vice President Mike Pence and former Sen. Jon Kyl , who will be the nominee \u2019 s guide for the confirmation process .\n\u201c We \u2019 re honored to be able to bring him here to the United States Senate and begin the important work the Senate will do discharging its constitutional duties to consider this good man as the president \u2019 s nominee , \u201d the vice president told Mr. McConnell .\nThe confirmation hearing could begin by Aug. 20 as the White House seeks to place Judge Kavanaugh on the high court for the start of its next term in October . Mr. Grassley gave no timeline but promised , \u201c It \u2019 s going to be thorough and going to be done right . \u201d\n\u201c Hopefully , it \u2019 s efficient , we get it done quickly , \u201d he said .\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , and all 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court to oppose Judge Kavanaugh . They said they feared he would be a pivotal vote to unravel Obamacare and reverse the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion . Sen. Kamala D. Harris , California Democrat , told young women that a possible ruling to overturn abortion rights \u201c will forever change your lives . \u201d\nAlready facing pressure from an energized Democratic base , Mr. Schumer vowed , \u201c I \u2019 m going to fight this nomination with everything I \u2019 ve got. \u201d But he rejected calls from some liberal activists to boycott Senate committee meetings or Senate floor action in a bid to derail Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination .\nIf Democrats can make voters aware of the nominee \u2019 s record , he said , \u201c then we will get a majority in the Senate to vote him down . \u201d\nBoth sides see the confirmation battle as a pivotal fight . Judge Kavanaugh would likely provide a fifth vote to tip the court \u2019 s balance in a more conservative direction for years to come .\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s record on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit , and his personal life story , make him a compelling choice .\n\u201c If these Democrats \u2014 whether they \u2019 re red states , blue states or purple states \u2014 actually look at the qualifications of Judge Brett Kavanaugh , they really have no choice but to confirm him , \u201d she said on Fox News .\nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said of the Democrats \u2019 tactics , \u201c While Democrats will stop at nothing to delay and obstruct the president \u2019 s choice , Judge Kavanaugh deserves a fair and swift confirmation hearing and up or down vote . \u201d\nIn judging a fair amount of time for confirmation , allies of the White House are looking at the benchmarks of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch , who was confirmed 66 days after his nomination last year , and Justice Sonia Sotomayor , whose confirmation process took 72 days in 2009 under President Obama . That timetable would put Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation vote in the second half of September .\nDemocrats lack the votes to stop the nomination if no Republican senator breaks ranks , and some liberals urged a delay of the confirmation . During a noon conference call hosted by liberal activist groups , one tactician advocated a strategy of using Mr. Mueller \u2019 s Russia investigation as a reason to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh , possibly until after November \u2019 s midterm elections .\n\u201c We can not rush this nomination , \u201d said Leslie Proll , a civil rights lawyer who is advising the NAACP on judicial nominations . \u201c There is a pending criminal investigation into the president . It would be irresponsible for the Senate to move forward without concluding that . \u201d\nSen. Cory A. Booker , New Jersey Democrat , a member of the Judiciary Committee and a likely 2020 presidential contender , also is arguing to halt any consideration of the nominee until Mr. Mueller wraps up his investigation .\n\u201c President Trump is currently a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation , and any nomination of a Supreme Court justice while that investigation continues is unacceptable because of the clear conflict of interest inherent in the president installing someone who could be the deciding vote on a number of potential issues from that investigation , \u201d Mr. Booker said .\nMr. Mueller \u2019 s team has said the president isn \u2019 t a \u201c target \u201d of the investigation , which is looking into suspected collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign in 2016 .\nMr. Schumer accused the president of using Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination to thwart the special counsel \u2019 s investigation . In earlier writings , Judge Kavanaugh expressed the view that presidents , as heads of the entire executive branch of government , should not be burdened by criminal investigations until after they leave office .\n\u201c He \u2019 s worried Mr. Mueller will go to the court and ask that the president be subpoenaed , \u201d Mr. Schumer said of the president . \u201c President Trump knows that Kavanaugh will be a barrier to preventing that investigation from going there . \u201d\nThe Democratic leader asserted , \u201c Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s background as a partisan political operative seems exactly like the kind of man President Trump would want on the Supreme Court if legal issues from the Mueller probe arise : deferential to a fault to executive authority , and with a long track record of partisan politics . \u201d\nMr. Grassley said Democrats \u2019 arguments are \u201c obstruction masquerading as silliness . \u201d\n\u201c President Clinton appointed Justice [ Stephen G. ] Breyer while the independent counsel was investigating the president over Whitewater , \u201d Mr. Grassley said on the Senate floor . \u201c At the time , his documents were under a grand jury subpoena . What other constitutional powers do the proponents of this argument believe the president should surrender simply because of an investigation ? \u201d\nLiberal activists vow to pressure two moderate Republican senators who support abortion rights : Susan M. Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska . Ms. Murkowski , who voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh for the appeals court in 2006 , said Tuesday that his nomination to the Supreme Court \u201c does put it into a different category . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s more to review , \u201d Ms. Murkowski said . \u201c I \u2019 m going to take my time . \u201d\nDemocrats and their allies also are hoping to slow down or derail the nomination with an exhaustive request for work records of the nominee . The first lawsuits were filed Tuesday demanding access to Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s records from his time in the George W. Bush White House from 2001 to 2006 , first as staff secretary and then as associate counsel , and from his time on the team of special counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the 1990s .\nFix the Court , an activist group , says it requested both sets of records long ago \u2014 in the case of the White House documents , the request was filed last year \u2014 but has yet to see anything .\n\u201c Federal agencies seem determined to make it as difficult as possible to obtain public records from judicial nominees , \u201d said Gabe Roth , executive director of Fix the Court .\nOf all the judges on Mr. Trump \u2019 s short list for the high court , Judge Kavanaugh had the lengthiest pedigree \u2014 and paper trail \u2014 in Washington . Internal White House communications are generally shielded from open-records laws , but communications with outside departments and agencies are not . Fix the Court requested communications between Judge Kavanaugh and the Justice Department .\nThe National Archives is already at work looking over which Kavanaugh documents it can release . That universe is likely larger than documents available under the Freedom of Information Act .\nMr. Schumer said he wants to see the documents produced before the Senate gets deep into vetting the nomination . He said it \u2019 s the same standard Democrats followed when they controlled the Senate and confirmed Justice Elena Kagan under President Obama .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not trying to delay . We just think it \u2019 s important to have these . The sooner , the better , \u201d he said .\nA bipartisan group of 34 of Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s former law clerks wrote in support of his nomination Tuesday to Mr. Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s ranking Democrat .\n\u201c We never once saw [ Judge Kavanaugh ] take a shortcut , treat a case as unimportant , or search for an easy answer , \u201d they wrote . \u201c Instead , in each case , large or small , he masters every detail and rereads every precedent . He listens carefully to the views of his colleagues and clerks , even \u2014 indeed , especially \u2014 when they differ from his own . \u201d\nThe NAACP \u2019 s Ms. Proll , however , called Judge Kavanaugh a \u201c dangerous ideologue \u201d and said the group has a message for lawmakers ahead of a confirmation vote .\n\u201c To each and every senator , we say this is the civil rights vote of your career , \u201d she said . \u201c We will be watching closely . Make no mistake \u2014 we are in the fight of our lives . We hope you are prepared for battle . \u201d\nThe White House also distributed a letter Tuesday night from dozens of Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s former classmates at Georgetown Prep high school and other alumni , praising his attributes .
