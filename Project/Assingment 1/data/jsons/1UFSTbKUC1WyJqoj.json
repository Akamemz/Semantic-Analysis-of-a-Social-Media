What will happen to the Supreme Court ?\nIt was the first session since the first presidential debate , and a good hour or so of the 80-minute class ended up being completely devoted to a question-filled discussion \u2014 sometimes veering into therapy-session territory \u2014 breaking down the week in presidential politics .\nHunt faced almost as many strong emotions as he did political queries .
