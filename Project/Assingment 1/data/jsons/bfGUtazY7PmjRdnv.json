    "content": "When it was signed , less than two years ago , the deal that Wisconsin struck with the electronics giant Foxconn contained all kinds of headline-grabbing numbers : the company promised a ten-billion-dollar investment in the state , a new 21.5-million-square-foot campus for manufacturing L.C.D . screens , and as many as thirteen thousand new jobs , paying an average wage of fifty-four thousand dollars a year . The manufacturing facility would be the Taiwan-based company \u2019 s first U.S. factory , and the prospect stirred the hopes of a region that still dreams of clawing back the middle-class factory jobs that were its pride in the middle of the twentieth century and that it lost to foreign competition long ago . As Dan Kaufman wrote for \u2588\u2588\u2588 last year , the deal also appeared poised to give a boost to the re\u00eblection prospects of Scott Walker , the conservative Republican who was then Wisconsin \u2019 s governor , who transformed the state into a bastion of conservative , free-market politics .\nBut since then Wisconsinites have found out a lot more about the $ 4.5 billion in taxpayer subsidies that Foxconn was promised\u2014money the company was being given despite the dramatic cuts that the state has made , in recent years , to education , infrastructure , and other public spending\u2014along with the pollution waivers and special legal privileges that it was granted and the bulldozing of neighborhoods that it needed to acquire the land it wanted .
