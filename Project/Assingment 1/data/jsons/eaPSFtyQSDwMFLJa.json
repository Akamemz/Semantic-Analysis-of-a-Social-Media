Make sure to tell all of your peers , \u201d said the message pushed to users of the Cruz mobile app .

He would stay in the race through Super Tuesday , dividing the religious right . And after he quit , Carson would continue to hold the Iowa messages against the Texas senator , questioning Cruz \u2019 s ethics and morals . He would later endorse Trump , a man who once suggested Carson was a child molester . So deep was Carson \u2019 s disdain for Cruz .\nFor Cruz , the episode opened the door to questions of trustworthiness that would dog him for the duration\u2014and it helped birth one of Trump \u2019 s most damning epithets : \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted . \u201d\nCruz would go on to win Iowa that night but the episode with Carson , fairly or not , fueled the characterization of Cruz long disseminated by Washington Republicans : that the gentleman from Texas was too slick , too ambitious , too unlikeable to ever be the nominee , let alone president .\nBut Cruz , powered by the most organized , adept and strategic campaign of the cycle , would go on to win hundreds of delegates and nine states . He began the race as an afterthought , and went on to outlive Jeb Bush , outlast Marco Rubio , and outmaneuver Trump at the arcane shadow game of selecting individual delegates who might be loyal .\nHe surpassed all expectations for a candidate who few gave much of a chance at the start . Cruz paired a distilled brand of pure conservatism with an instinct for the depth of anger in the electorate that few others saw . He raised millions from small donors and built a big-money operation , too .\nThere was even a brief moment , almost exactly four weeks ago in Wisconsin , when Cruz \u2019 s inner circle truly believed they had a clear path to victory , forcing Trump into a contested convention and winning on a second or third ballot . In his Milwaukee victory speech , Cruz hailed Wisconsin as a \u201c turning point . \u201d\nHe was right about that . He was wrong about the direction the race was about to turn .\nJust when Cruz had emerged as Trump \u2019 s sole serious challenger , he needed to win over the same Republican Party insiders he had built his career running against ; he needed them to rally around him . Their problem wasn \u2019 t with Cruz \u2019 s hard-line conservative principles . It was his hard-edged personality and political practices . They all had Carson stories of their own .\n\u201c The idea that there \u2019 s ever been a spokesperson less equipped to make an argument for party unity \u2014 I don \u2019 t think there is anybody , \u201d said Josh Holmes , who served as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s chief of staff when Cruz arrived in the Senate in 2012 .\nSo many of his congressional colleagues and mainstream Republicans stayed on the sidelines . Some embraced Trump . Others attacked Cruz , including former Speaker John Boehner , who called him \u201c Lucifer in the flesh. \u201d A few endorsed half-heartedly .\nThey might have feared Trump . But they loathed Cruz . One of Cruz \u2019 s few endorsers , Lindsey Graham , compared the choice to poison or being shot .\n\u201c Which one of Ted Cruz \u2019 s issues are they out of line with ? What is it that they \u2019 re so out of line with ? \u201d asked Tyler , who resigned as Cruz 's communications director in February . \u201c It \u2019 s petulance and it \u2019 s petty and it \u2019 s small . \u201d\nIt was also damaging , just as Cruz was about to run into a demographic buzzsaw . After constructing his campaign around a conservative base and religious right\u2014he launched his bid at the world \u2019 s largest evangelical university\u2014the race in April turned to the more secular Northeast . Cruz would lose not just the next six states but every county in them .\nThen , on Tuesday , Cruz made his last , failed stand in Indiana . He lost in a landslide .\n\u201c It all really happened very suddenly , \u201d said one Cruz source . \u201c We were on a high after Wisconsin , fundraising was going great . We knew we were going to lose New York and the \u2018 Acela primary , \u2019 not a big surprise , but when it happened , it just had a different impact . The margins of Trump \u2019 s victory hurt us . We are all still trying to come to terms with it ourselves . \u201d\nFrom the start , Cruz \u2019 s campaign was unusually open about the process and planning that went into running for president . The week of his surprise announcement at Liberty University , he and his team were talking openly about the four \u201c lanes \u201d in the race : tea party , libertarian , evangelical and establishment .\nCruz , they said , would compete to consolidate three of them\u2014all but the traditional \u201c establishment \u201d Republican lane filled with familiar names like Rubio , Chris Christie and Bush . Cruz \u2019 s goal was simple : No one would outflank him on the right on policy . And no one would outflank him on anger with the Republican elites .\nHe succeeded on the former . But Trump dominated him on the latter .\nThat consolidation strategy was borne not just of Cruz \u2019 s political pedigree but also of the 2016 calendar . A spate of Southern states had jumped the line to vote on March 1 , in what became known as the SEC primary . Evangelical-rich Texas , Georgia , Alabama , Arkansas , Oklahoma and Tennessee would vote that day . As campaign manager Roe bragged to \u2588\u2588\u2588 last fall , \u201c My 19-month-old daughter couldn \u2019 t color a map that \u2019 s better for us . \u201d\nBut after Cruz carried Iowa , an ominous warning sign came in South Carolina , where Trump carried what was supposed to be Cruz \u2019 s base , winning evangelical voters 33 percent to 27 percent , according to exit polling .\nIndeed , Trump \u2019 s Southern success would repeat itself on Super Tuesday , a day Cruz himself had once described as his firewall . Trump collected 254 of the delegates up for grabs that day , outpacing Cruz \u2019 s haul of 218 , almost half of which came from Texas . Cruz \u2019 s strategists had constructed their entire campaign to push through the latter half of the calendar with the lead .\nBut after Super Tuesday , Cruz was running from behind . His team launched an alternative plan\u2014to deny Trump the outright win and take the nomination to a contested convention .\nAnd for a while , it appeared to be working . Over the course of March and April , as Trump racked primary win after primary win , Cruz \u2019 s data team shifted from targeting voters to identifying state activists who might serve as loyal delegates in Cleveland . And suddenly , Cruz looked like he was back on track\u2014his team was able to sell the idea that keeping Trump from clinching was the GOP \u2019 s last chance to save the party from a celebrity billionaire few would classify as conservative .\nSuddenly , Cruz was winning the race he thought would matter .\nBut he was doing something else in turn\u2014handing Trump a claim many Republicans saw as legitimate . Cruz , Trump said , was trying to snatch the nomination away from the man Republican voters clearly preferred .\nBut as the 2016 field narrowed , it was the \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d label that increasing stuck to Cruz , just as Trump \u2019 s \u201c low energy \u201d moniker clung mercilessly to Bush .\nTrump wasn \u2019 t the first candidate to question Cruz \u2019 s integrity . Rubio tagged him as \u201c calculated \u201d ( and his super PAC used the tagline \u201c CalculaTed , \u201d a play on Cruz \u2019 s \u201c TrusTed \u201d slogan ) . Supporters of Mike Huckabee attacked Cruz in Iowa for not tithing . Even Carly Fiorina , Cruz \u2019 s short-lived future running mate , said in January of Cruz : \u201c He says whatever he needs to say to get elected . \u201d\nBut as the 2016 field narrowed , it was the \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d label that increasingly stuck to Cruz , just as Trump \u2019 s \u201c low energy \u201d moniker clung mercilessly to Bush . And it deeply irked Cruz , a detail-oriented lawyer who parses his words as closely as any politician , according to those close to him .\nTrump said it dates from the Iowa caucus episode with Carson . \u201c I call him `` Lyin ' Ted Cruz '' after what he did to Ben Carson and many other things , \u201d Trump told Sean Hannity in late March . \u201c You know , he lies . He really lies . \u201d\nThe fact that Cruz had spent months and months praising Trump \u2019 s every move in 2015 , only to turn into his harshest critic when it became politically expedient in early 2016 only fed into Trump \u2019 s caricature .\n`` When it comes to Donald Trump , I like Donald Trump . I think he 's terrific , I think he 's brash , I think he speaks the truth , '' Cruz had gushed last June . \u201c I have been glad to praise Donald Trump , \u201d Cruz boasted last August . In September , Cruz even invited Trump to keynote a rally he was organizing at the foot of the Capitol .\nLast year , Cruz would chide the press as small-minded for their efforts to goad him into criticizing whatever Trump \u2019 s latest outlandish statement was . \u201c The Establishment \u2019 s only hope : Trump & me in a cage match , \u201d Cruz tweeted in December to diffuse tensions ahead of a debate . \u201c Sorry to disappoint \u2014 @ realDonaldTrump is terrific . # DealWithIt . \u201d\nBut as he feuded with Trump in the final three months of the race , he blamed the same media he \u2019 d accused of stoking tensions for now giving Trump a free pass . He said executives wanted to boost ratings and revenue , or that they were secret Democrats out to help Hillary Clinton . By the end , Cruz wasn \u2019 t just lashing out at the mainstream media , as he had from the beginning , but some of the key conservative organs of the right : Hannity , Fox News and the Drudge Report , to name a few .\nIn January , Cruz had hailed the Drudge Report as a valuable avenue to bypass media gatekeepers . But in April , he said Drudge was in Trump \u2019 s pocket : \u201c The Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign . \u201d\nStill , four weeks ago , when Cruz strode onto the stage at Milwaukee \u2019 s American Serb Hall , many in his campaign believed they were watching the likely Republican nominee . According to internal polls , Cruz had come from behind to land a victory in Wisconsin that was fueled not only by his traditional conservative base , but by a new coalition of women , more centrist Republicans and young people .\nCruz had been talking for months about conservatives coalescing behind his campaign . Now it was actually happening .\nMy theory was , if we can expand this coalition the way we did in Wisconsin , we can go into the Northeastern states\u2014it \u2019 s a Trump stronghold , we don \u2019 t have to win \u2014 but we have to be strong . Well , what a fucking disaster that was . \u201d\nHis campaign hoped that Wisconsin\u2014a more diverse , blue-collar state\u2014would offer a blueprint for how Cruz could break through as the race headed into rougher territory in the more moderate Northeast .\n\u201c My theory was , if we can expand this coalition the way we did in Wisconsin , we can go into the Northeastern states\u2014it \u2019 s a Trump stronghold , we don \u2019 t have to win\u2014but we have to be strong , \u201d said one knowledgeable Cruz source . \u201c Well , what a fucking disaster that was . \u201d\nBack before the Iowa caucuses , Cruz \u2019 s campaign had conceived of a clever line defining Trump as a liberal without explicitly attacking him : accusing him of \u201c New York values. \u201d It was straight out of Roe \u2019 s old playbook . In his Missouri days , Roe had successfully beaten an opponent by hammering her \u201c San Francisco values . \u201d\nIt worked in Iowa . But as the race actually turned to New York three months later , the line hung around Cruz like an albatross . Meanwhile , the country \u2019 s most aggressive press corps lay in wait . \u201c Take the F U Train Ted , \u201d the cover of the New York Daily News greeted him .\nIn the liberal Northeast , Cruz began to talk more and more about winning the loyalties of delegates at party conventions and the need to stop Trump , and less about his conservative agenda .\n\u201c Somewhere after Wisconsin , our message became , \u2018 We hate Trump , everybody hates Trump , I \u2019 m going to beat Trump , \u2019 and , \u2018 Wow , we \u2019 ve got this awesome convention delegate counting thing because we \u2019 re so good at process , \u201d the Cruz source said . \u201c That \u2019 s a problem . That \u2019 s not Ted being Ted \u2026 it \u2019 s just what the story became . It seems like we weren \u2019 t able to do anything about it . \u201d\n\u201c The Wisconsin win , \u201d the Cruz source continued , \u201c was the biggest day in the campaign . We all thought we were going to get it . But after the win , we started trending down in every state , state by state . \u201d\nCruz finished third in New York with less than 15 percent of the vote , more than 35 percentage points behind Trump . The margin was devastating .\nState Sen. Michael Hough , Cruz \u2019 s Maryland campaign chair , said Cruz had had a path to collecting at least some delegates in Maryland immediately after Wisconsin . But after getting blown out in New York , all momentum halted .\n\u201c For a short time there was some hope we could do something for him , \u201d Hough said . \u201c But I think the New York thing , the media idea that , \u2018 Oh , it \u2019 s over , \u2019 I think it swung all the momentum to Trump . \u201d\nA week after New York , Cruz would lose not just Maryland , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Delaware and Connecticut but every county and congressional district in those states . The only state Cruz would win delegates in was Rhode Island ; he never campaigned there .\nCruz \u2019 s inner circle gathered this Monday . It was not a conversation his team had expected to have just weeks after winning big in Wisconsin . But the day before the Indiana primary , there they were , gathered in the seventh-floor offices of Cruz \u2019 s Houston headquarters , discussing the senator \u2019 s suddenly shaky future .\n\u201c It was the first time there was any discussion about it in that senior staff meeting , \u201d which happened every Monday , said someone close to the campaign . \u201c The polls continued to show we weren \u2019 t going to do well in Indiana , that \u2019 s where things were going . Then the question became , \u2018 OK , what happened , what do you do next ? \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c It was really after the losses of last week , the magnitude of the Trump victories , the fact that he broke 50 percent , 60 percent , \u201d said another Cruz source involved . \u201c It destroyed our narrative that there \u2019 s a ceiling to his support . \u201d\nChad Sweet , Cruz \u2019 s campaign chairman and an old friend , was adamant in the Monday meeting that the senator would stay in , regardless of Indiana , according to two sources . But not everyone agreed . The discussion stretched beyond 2016 to Cruz \u2019 s Senate seat and his political future .\nStill , Cruz had $ 9 million in the bank , after all , and some of his allies saw no downside to staying in as long as Trump didn \u2019 t have the needed delegates .\nBut by the time polls opened in Indiana , Cruz had already pulled every political stunt he could to blunt Trump \u2019 s momentum . He \u2019 d struck a pact with John Kasich to pull out of Indiana , in exchange for Cruz abandoning two later states . And he \u2019 d named his vice presidential pick , Fiorina , less than 24 hours after he had been mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination . It was a blatant play to draw attention . It didn \u2019 t work .\nThe New York Times didn \u2019 t even devote a separate story to the announcement for the printed edition , instead pairing it with Bernie Sanders cutting back his staff . \u201c Failing hopefuls regroup to save their campaigns , \u201d read the headline .\nCruz did get a spike on social media but it didn \u2019 t last . The next day , Boehner calling him \u201c Lucifer \u201d and a \u201c miserable son of a bitch \u201d drowned out Fiorina , with 82,428 mentions of Cruz and Boehner compared with 66,434 for Cruz and Fiorina , according to Zignal Labs , which tracks digital conversation .\nTyler said the Cruz campaign had been in a bind .\n\u201c Doing nothing would have been dumb , \u201d he said . \u201c Doing something was smart and so it was a smart move . But in terms of the timing , sometimes you don \u2019 t have a choice . You know what \u2019 s going to happen but you have to do it anyway . \u201d\nCruz allies bristled toward the end that the so-called Never Trump movement never fully embraced him , and that those who did , did so too late . Some in the campaign blamed Kasich \u2019 s refusal to drop out for preventing a unification around Cruz . \u201c He clearly hurt us , \u201d said a source close to the campaign .\nBut Cruz \u2019 s lack of relationships loomed large . \u201c We all know that Ted Cruz is hated by every human being in Washington that draws breath , \u201d said Rick Wilson , a Republican strategist who has worked in opposition to Trump . \u201c Ted not having a lot of friends in D.C. \u2014 it adds ups . \u201d\nCruz woke up on the morning of the Indiana primary to rain and the news that Trump was touting a National Enquirer story that claimed , without evidence , that his father was involved in John F. Kennedy \u2019 s assassination .\nIn a heated news conference , the usually measured Cruz unleashed . He called Trump \u201c amoral \u201d and a \u201c serial philanderer , \u201d leveling the kinds of accusations that he had proudly avoided for the entirety of the campaign . And he aimed , once again , to push back on the \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d moniker with which Trump had so effectively tagged him .\n`` This man is a pathological liar , he does n't know the difference between truth and lies , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c In a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book , he accuses everyone of lying . ''\nCruz suffered indignity after indignity in the lead-up to the Indiana primary , from a squalling child protester whom he found himself scolding , to his would-be running mate falling off a stage in a video that went viral in political circles . And on Monday , in another video that dominated the day , Cruz engaged with Trump protesters , one of whom took to simply yelling \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted ! \u201d as the senator sought to make his points .\nCruz had had enough . He made the final call Tuesday in a meeting with Roe , his campaign manager , and Johnson , his chief strategist .\nSome staffers had already been bracing for the news after being told to fly to Indianapolis from Houston on Tuesday . Many were informed by texts from Roe , thanking them for their hard work , less than an hour before Cruz made the announcement official . In a sign of the tight ship Roe ran , the news did not leak out until Roe himself walked over to a small group of reporters at the watch party , minutes before Cruz took the stage , and gave the Texas Tribune reporter the go-ahead to tweet the development .\nFiorina was still speaking on stage , after not even a week on the ticket . The televisions at the rally had been switched off shortly before she took the stage . CNN had been playing .\nCorrection : An earlier version of this story identified \u201c Take the F U Train Ted \u201d as a New York Post cover . It was a cover for the New York Daily News .",

As campaign manager Roe bragged to POLITICO last fall, \u201cMy 19-month-old daughter couldn\u2019t color a map that\u2019s better for us.\u201d\n\nBut after Cruz carried Iowa, an ominous warning sign came in South Carolina, where Trump carried what was supposed to be Cruz\u2019s base, winning evangelical voters 33 percent to 27 percent, according to exit polling.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s Southern success would repeat itself on Super Tuesday, a day Cruz himself had once described as his firewall. Trump collected 254 of the delegates up for grabs that day, outpacing Cruz\u2019s haul of 218, almost half of which came from Texas. Cruz\u2019s strategists had constructed their entire campaign to push through the latter half of the calendar with the lead.\n\nBut after Super Tuesday, Cruz was running from behind. His team launched an alternative plan\u2014to deny Trump the outright win and take the nomination to a contested convention.\n\nAnd for a while, it appeared to be working. Over the course of March and April, as Trump racked primary win after primary win, Cruz\u2019s data team shifted from targeting voters to identifying state activists who might serve as loyal delegates in Cleveland. And suddenly, Cruz looked like he was back on track\u2014his team was able to sell the idea that keeping Trump from clinching was the GOP\u2019s last chance to save the party from a celebrity billionaire few would classify as conservative.\n\nSuddenly, Cruz was winning the race he thought would matter.\n\nBut he was doing something else in turn\u2014handing Trump a claim many Republicans saw as legitimate. Cruz, Trump said, was trying to snatch the nomination away from the man Republican voters clearly preferred.\n\nBut as the 2016 field narrowed, it was the \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d label that increasing stuck to Cruz, just as Trump\u2019s \u201clow energy\u201d moniker clung mercilessly to Bush.\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t the first candidate to question Cruz\u2019s integrity. Rubio tagged him as \u201ccalculated\u201d (and his super PAC used the tagline \u201cCalculaTed,\u201d a play on Cruz\u2019s \u201cTrusTed\u201d slogan). Supporters of Mike Huckabee attacked Cruz in Iowa for not tithing. Even Carly Fiorina, Cruz\u2019s short-lived future running mate, said in January of Cruz: \u201cHe says whatever he needs to say to get elected.\u201d\n\nBut as the 2016 field narrowed, it was the \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d label that increasingly stuck to Cruz, just as Trump\u2019s \u201clow energy\u201d moniker clung mercilessly to Bush. And it deeply irked Cruz, a detail-oriented lawyer who parses his words as closely as any politician, according to those close to him.\n\nTrump said it dates from the Iowa caucus episode with Carson. \u201cI call him \"Lyin' Ted Cruz\" after what he did to Ben Carson and many other things,\u201d Trump told Sean Hannity in late March. \u201cYou know, he lies. He really lies.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Cruz had spent months and months praising Trump\u2019s every move in 2015, only to turn into his harshest critic when it became politically expedient in early 2016 only fed into Trump\u2019s caricature.\n\n\"When it comes to Donald Trump, I like Donald Trump. I think he's terrific, I think he's brash, I think he speaks the truth,\" Cruz had gushed last June. \u201cI have been glad to praise Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz boasted last August. In September, Cruz even invited Trump to keynote a rally he was organizing at the foot of the Capitol.\n\nLast year, Cruz would chide the press as small-minded for their efforts to goad him into criticizing whatever Trump\u2019s latest outlandish statement was. \u201cThe Establishment\u2019s only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,\u201d Cruz tweeted in December to diffuse tensions ahead of a debate. \u201cSorry to disappoint \u2014 @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt.\u201d\n\nBut as he feuded with Trump in the final three months of the race, he blamed the same media he\u2019d accused of stoking tensions for now giving Trump a free pass. He said executives wanted to boost ratings and revenue, or that they were secret Democrats out to help Hillary Clinton. By the end, Cruz wasn\u2019t just lashing out at the mainstream media, as he had from the beginning, but some of the key conservative organs of the right: Hannity, Fox News and the Drudge Report, to name a few.\n\nIn January, Cruz had hailed the Drudge Report as a valuable avenue to bypass media gatekeepers. But in April, he said Drudge was in Trump\u2019s pocket: \u201cThe Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\nStill, four weeks ago, when Cruz strode onto the stage at Milwaukee\u2019s American Serb Hall, many in his campaign believed they were watching the likely Republican nominee. According to internal polls, Cruz had come from behind to land a victory in Wisconsin that was fueled not only by his traditional conservative base, but by a new coalition of women, more centrist Republicans and young people.\n\nCruz had been talking for months about conservatives coalescing behind his campaign. Now it was actually happening.\n\nMy theory was, if we can expand this coalition the way we did in Wisconsin, we can go into the Northeastern states\u2014it\u2019s a Trump stronghold, we don\u2019t have to win \u2014 but we have to be strong. Well, what a fucking disaster that was.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis campaign hoped that Wisconsin\u2014a more diverse, blue-collar state\u2014would offer a blueprint for how Cruz could break through as the race headed into rougher territory in the more moderate Northeast.\n\n\u201cMy theory was, if we can expand this coalition the way we did in Wisconsin, we can go into the Northeastern states\u2014it\u2019s a Trump stronghold, we don\u2019t have to win\u2014but we have to be strong,\u201d said one knowledgeable Cruz source. \u201cWell, what a fucking disaster that was.\u201d\n\nBack before the Iowa caucuses, Cruz\u2019s campaign had conceived of a clever line defining Trump as a liberal without explicitly attacking him: accusing him of \u201cNew York values.\u201d It was straight out of Roe\u2019s old playbook. In his Missouri days, Roe had successfully beaten an opponent by hammering her \u201cSan Francisco values.\u201d\n\nIt worked in Iowa. But as the race actually turned to New York three months later, the line hung around Cruz like an albatross. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s most aggressive press corps lay in wait. \u201cTake the F U Train Ted,\u201d the cover of the New York Daily News greeted him.\n\nIn the liberal Northeast, Cruz began to talk more and more about winning the loyalties of delegates at party conventions and the need to stop Trump, and less about his conservative agenda.\n\n\u201cSomewhere after Wisconsin, our message became, \u2018We hate Trump, everybody hates Trump, I\u2019m going to beat Trump,\u2019 and, \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve got this awesome convention delegate counting thing because we\u2019re so good at process,\u201d the Cruz source said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s not Ted being Ted \u2026 it\u2019s just what the story became. It seems like we weren\u2019t able to do anything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wisconsin win,\u201d the Cruz source continued, \u201cwas the biggest day in the campaign. We all thought we were going to get it. But after the win, we started trending down in every state, state by state.\u201d\n\nCruz finished third in New York with less than 15 percent of the vote, more than 35 percentage points behind Trump. The margin was devastating.\n\nState Sen. Michael Hough, Cruz\u2019s Maryland campaign chair, said Cruz had had a path to collecting at least some delegates in Maryland immediately after Wisconsin. But after getting blown out in New York, all momentum halted.\n\n\u201cFor a short time there was some hope we could do something for him,\u201d Hough said. \u201cBut I think the New York thing, the media idea that, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s over,\u2019 I think it swung all the momentum to Trump.\u201d\n\nA week after New York, Cruz would lose not just Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut but every county and congressional district in those states. The only state Cruz would win delegates in was Rhode Island; he never campaigned there.\n\n***\n\nCruz\u2019s inner circle gathered this Monday. It was not a conversation his team had expected to have just weeks after winning big in Wisconsin. But the day before the Indiana primary, there they were, gathered in the seventh-floor offices of Cruz\u2019s Houston headquarters, discussing the senator\u2019s suddenly shaky future.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time there was any discussion about it in that senior staff meeting,\u201d which happened every Monday, said someone close to the campaign. \u201cThe polls continued to show we weren\u2019t going to do well in Indiana, that\u2019s where things were going. Then the question became, \u2018OK, what happened, what do you do next?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really after the losses of last week, the magnitude of the Trump victories, the fact that he broke 50 percent, 60 percent,\u201d said another Cruz source involved. \u201cIt destroyed our narrative that there\u2019s a ceiling to his support.\u201d\n\nChad Sweet, Cruz\u2019s campaign chairman and an old friend, was adamant in the Monday meeting that the senator would stay in, regardless of Indiana, according to two sources. But not everyone agreed. The discussion stretched beyond 2016 to Cruz\u2019s Senate seat and his political future.\n\nStill, Cruz had $9 million in the bank, after all, and some of his allies saw no downside to staying in as long as Trump didn\u2019t have the needed delegates.\n\nGetty\n\nBut by the time polls opened in Indiana, Cruz had already pulled every political stunt he could to blunt Trump\u2019s momentum. He\u2019d struck a pact with John Kasich to pull out of Indiana, in exchange for Cruz abandoning two later states. And he\u2019d named his vice presidential pick, Fiorina, less than 24 hours after he had been mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination. It was a blatant play to draw attention. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nThe New York Times didn\u2019t even devote a separate story to the announcement for the printed edition, instead pairing it with Bernie Sanders cutting back his staff. \u201cFailing hopefuls regroup to save their campaigns,\u201d read the headline.\n\nCruz did get a spike on social media but it didn\u2019t last. The next day, Boehner calling him \u201cLucifer\u201d and a \u201cmiserable son of a bitch\u201d drowned out Fiorina, with 82,428 mentions of Cruz and Boehner compared with 66,434 for Cruz and Fiorina, according to Zignal Labs, which tracks digital conversation.\n\nTyler said the Cruz campaign had been in a bind.\n\n\u201cDoing nothing would have been dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing something was smart and so it was a smart move. But in terms of the timing, sometimes you don\u2019t have a choice. You know what\u2019s going to happen but you have to do it anyway.\u201d\n\nCruz allies bristled toward the end that the so-called Never Trump movement never fully embraced him, and that those who did, did so too late. Some in the campaign blamed Kasich\u2019s refusal to drop out for preventing a unification around Cruz. \u201cHe clearly hurt us,\u201d said a source close to the campaign.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s lack of relationships loomed large. \u201cWe all know that Ted Cruz is hated by every human being in Washington that draws breath,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist who has worked in opposition to Trump. \u201cTed not having a lot of friends in D.C. \u2014 it adds ups.\u201d\n\nUltimately, there was nothing left to try.\n\n***\n\nCruz woke up on the morning of the Indiana primary to rain and the news that Trump was touting a National Enquirer story that claimed, without evidence, that his father was involved in John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nThe day would only get worse.\n\nIn a heated news conference, the usually measured Cruz unleashed. He called Trump \u201camoral\u201d and a \u201cserial philanderer,\u201d leveling the kinds of accusations that he had proudly avoided for the entirety of the campaign. And he aimed, once again, to push back on the \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d moniker with which Trump had so effectively tagged him.\n\n\"This man is a pathological liar, he doesn't know the difference between truth and lies,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIn a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book, he accuses everyone of lying.\"\n\nCruz suffered indignity after indignity in the lead-up to the Indiana primary, from a squalling child protester whom he found himself scolding, to his would-be running mate falling off a stage in a video that went viral in political circles. And on Monday, in another video that dominated the day, Cruz engaged with Trump protesters, one of whom took to simply yelling \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted!\u201d as the senator sought to make his points.\n\nCruz had had enough. He made the final call Tuesday in a meeting with Roe, his campaign manager, and Johnson, his chief strategist.\n\nSome staffers had already been bracing for the news after being told to fly to Indianapolis from Houston on Tuesday. Many were informed by texts from Roe, thanking them for their hard work, less than an hour before Cruz made the announcement official. In a sign of the tight ship Roe ran, the news did not leak out until Roe himself walked over to a small group of reporters at the watch party, minutes before Cruz took the stage, and gave the Texas Tribune reporter the go-ahead to tweet the development.\n\nFiorina was still speaking on stage, after not even a week on the ticket. The televisions at the rally had been switched off shortly before she took the stage. CNN had been playing.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story identified \u201cTake the F U Train Ted\u201d as a New York Post cover. It was a cover for the New York Daily News.",
