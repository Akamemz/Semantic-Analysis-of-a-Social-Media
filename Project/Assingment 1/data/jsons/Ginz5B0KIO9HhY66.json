This is big news for the major oil producing countries , obviously , but it also has important \u2014 and dramatically positive \u2014 implications for the short-term American economic outlook . That 's obvious if you 're a heavy driver looking for some relief at the pump , but in truth the positive consequences are broad and widespread and the impact should be felt even by non-drivers .\nHere are six ways cheaper oil is great news for the American economy .\nFalling oil prices lead to lower gasoline prices , which leads commuters to have lower spending on fueling their cars . That leaves them with more money in their pockets to spend on other stuff . Studies of the impact of gasoline price increases tend to show a particularly marked impact on food spending . Higher gasoline prices meant less dining out and more food at home , and a shift in grocery purchases toward less expensive items . Cheaper gasoline should have the precise opposite effect .\nConsumers will splurge more on their non-durable spending \u2014 buying pricier groceries and eating out more frequently . That 's good news for grocers ' and restauranteurs ' profit margins , and it also means you should see more hiring in those sectors .\nIn some times and places , a shift of consumer spending away from gasoline and toward other goods would simply lead to higher prices for those goods . But the American economy continues to exhibit a fair amount of labor market weakness , meaning that there is room for non-inflationary hiring . In other words , there are plenty of part-time workers out there eager for extra shifts and still a fair number of long-term unemployed looking for jobs .\nWith consumers paying less at the pump , they 'll be demanding more locally produced goods and services and that demand will improve labor markets across the country .\nThis does n't necessarily make a ton of sense , but studies consistently show that consumers respond to short-term changes in gasoline prices by buying more or less fuel efficient vehicles .
