A typical cabinet secretary has to win over senior career officials within his or her department , persuade congressional committees and subcommittees to back the administration \u2019 s policy , line up nongovernmental organizations to pressure wavering senators or congressmen , sell the policy to the public , and effectively tell an impatient president what can and can \u2019 t be done realistically .\n\u201c You have to judge each administration by just how hard it is to get change in government , \u201d says Carl DeMaio , a senior fellow who directs the presidential transitions initiative of the Performance Institute , a nonpartisan , private think tank seeking to improve public- and private-sector performance . \u201c When you do see turnarounds in government , it 's exceptional . \u201d\nThose with prior experience \u2013 such as former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , Mr. Trump \u2019 s nominee for Transportation secretary \u2013 have a greater chance of success , government management experts say .
