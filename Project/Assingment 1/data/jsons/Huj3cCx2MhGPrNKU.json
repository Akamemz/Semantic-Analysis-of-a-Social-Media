They did not elaborate on what the women were supposed to do to prove that these events , which occurred decades ago , really took place . Apparently Senator John McCain considered corroborating statements from their friends and family sufficient , as he did not qualify his call for Moore to step down .\nMoore adamantly denied the claims \u2014 without addressing the specifics \u2014 telling his supporters that he is the victim of a campaign to \u201c silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me . \u201d\nThe Obama-Clinton Machine \u2019 s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I \u2019 ve EVER faced !\nWe are are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message .
