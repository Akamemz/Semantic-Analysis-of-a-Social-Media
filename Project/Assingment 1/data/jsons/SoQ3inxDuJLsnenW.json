In light of all we \u2019 ve seen during this stupidest of years , a year where I had to move my book about this country tearing itself apart from the fiction section to nonfiction , how the hell can anyone keep a straight face as he , she , or xe demands that we default to trust the system ?\nOkay , this is where Team Fake Pearl Clutch jumps in and whines about my \u201c dangerous talk \u201d and about how I have no \u201c honor \u201d because I won \u2019 t submit in advance to another establishment okie-doke . Yeah , sure , whatever \u2013 and the emperor caught pneumonia because the little kid pointed out that he wasn \u2019 t wearing any clothes , not because he was walking around with his junk in the wind .\nThe system is manifestly rigged \u2013 even Heap Big Chief Warren used to say so until a memo informed her that this meme is now inconvenient \u2013 so spare me your sanctimonious crap about our sacred system . Our loyalty is properly only to the Constitution , not a perversion of it . Just because you hold office under Article I , II , or III doesn \u2019 t mean we still owe you respect or deference when you treat your obligations to the People like a teenage Thai boy at one of Raymond Burr \u2019 s Halloween parties .\nWe owe the system nothing . Nada . Zip . Instead , the system owes us fairness and honesty , and without them it has no right to our default acceptance of its results . That acceptance must be earned . This means that the system must aggressively police its own integrity , and this year it has utterly failed to do so .\nThe most important thing in a democratic republic , the keystone that holds it together and ensures the peaceful transition of power , is the ability for a loser to accept a loss . We used to be able to fight out our political differences and , if we came up short , shrug and say , \u201c Well , next time we \u2019 ll convince a majority. \u201d We could move on , confident that the playing field had been level , that we had been heard , and that we had lost fair and square .\n`` Not anymore . Trump \u2019 s wrong about a lot , but he \u2019 s not wrong about this . He may very well lose , but it won \u2019 t be fair and square . And Trump is not the problem for saying so .\nIn a sudden and shocking burst of coherence during the third debate , in which Trump put a cherry on top of his brutal trouncing of his Westworld-escapee opponent by refusing to agree to be scammed , The Donald articulated a three-point critique of the system that its defenders have not even tried to answer . Instead , all we got was fake outrage over Trump \u2019 s perfectly legitimate rejection of the default legitimacy of our illegitimate system .\nHis first point was that the media is not merely biased but an active partisan player for the Democrats . The media ignores what hurts the left ( remember the 24/7 coverage of Project Veritas ? Good times ) and plays up nonsense that helps it ( remember the 24/7 coverage of Chubby de la Cartel Chica ? Bueno times ) . The media , as it loves to crow , is a vital component of the system , but only when it at least pretends to be objective . By going full Goebbels \u2013 never go full Goebbels \u2013 it undercut and wrecked the foundational ability of all citizens to be heard and respected and to believe that they are competing on a level playing field . If you aren \u2019 t one of the mouth-breathing drool donors in love with Hillary , do you feel you \u2019 ve been heard or respected ? Do you believe Trump has been able to compete on a level playing field ?\nThen there is electoral integrity . We \u2019 ve seen numerous investigations of voter fraud and no one cares . We have one party refusing to clear voter rolls of ineligible voters , while also on a quest to ensure that no one need prove his identity to vote . Sure , Democrats have good reason to believe their voters are too lazy and/or stupid to obtain ID cards , but we all know why they really oppose voter ID : it makes it harder to cheat . And then there \u2019 s Project Veritas . We have a Democrat party operative and the husband of a sitting Democrat congressbeing caught on tape proving Democrat catspaws paid to cause violence at a Trump rally , violence which the media covered and blamed on Trump to damaging effect . And this guy went to the White House hundreds of times and frequently met with President Faily McWorsethancarter .\nHey Pearl Clutchers , read that again and tell me how this isn \u2019 t a thousand times worse than Watergate . Then tell me how this is getting only a millionth of the outrage and coverage if the system isn \u2019 t rigged .\nSo we \u2019 re supposed to take it on faith that the votes are going to be counted fairly ? Uh huh , sure . If you think Trump is somehow morally obligated to preemptively give up his right to challenge the result after that , you can kiss his hanging chad .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the corruption of the rule of law . Trump was right \u2013 Hillary should not even be running because if we had a single justice system \u2013 instead of one for the powerful and connected and another for everyone else \u2013 her unhealthy carcass would be in federal prison . That \u2019 s not hyperbole \u2013 that \u2019 s literal truth understood by anyone who worked with classified materials and/or actually passed a bar exam . Then there is the IRS persecution of conservative organizations that has gone totally unpunished . And , of course , the Wikileaks treasure trove has shown that the Democrats simply ignore the law in their campaigns , secure in the knowledge that they will never be held accountable while their opponents will see a weaponized FBI and DOJ turned upon them .\nIt would be nice to be able to say , \u201c Well , she won fair and square. \u201d But that \u2019 s not going to happen . My gut says that a majority of people will vote for her , but I live in Los Angeles and a lot of people around here are libfascist half-wits , so maybe my perspective is skewed . Maybe the polls are right \u2013 you know , the super scientific ones putting the race somewhere between Felonia von Pantsuit up 12 and Trump up 3 . But this election won \u2019 t be \u201c fair \u201d in any sense of the word . The media has put not just its thumb but its bloated behind on the scale . All of us have not been heard , much less been respected . How can we trust the votes will be counted fairly when clearly documented admissions of election tampering get a mere shrug if they aren \u2019 t ignored entirely ?\nSorry ( not sorry ) , but like Trump , I refuse to be a good little boy and politely agree in advance to accept whatever the ruling class chooses to do without protest or complaint . You want us to respect and honor what you say are the results of the election ? Start by respecting and honoring us .\nIs this dangerous talk ? Hell yes \u2013 but the danger doesn \u2019 t come from us pointing out the corruption . The danger is the corruption .
