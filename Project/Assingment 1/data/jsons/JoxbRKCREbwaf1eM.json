( Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters )\n\u2018 No one will come to trample our country , our land ! \u2019\nOne of the reasons border apprehensions have dropped from their alarming peak in May is that Mexico has been pretty aggressive in stopping third-country nationals from traversing its territory on their way north to make bogus asylum claims so they can be released into the U.S .\nBut why has Mexico been willing to work with us like this ? It \u2019 s especially curious because in the past , Mexico was not at all eager to help us limit illegal immigration , a pattern we might have expected to intensify with last year \u2019 s election as president of left-wing populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ( commonly known as AMLO , pronounced as a word rather than initials ) .\nNo doubt President Trump \u2019 s tariff threats had some effect . Three-quarters of Mexico \u2019 s exports go to the U.S. , and despite increased integration of our economies over the past couple of decades , they still need us a lot more than we need them . Also , Trump \u2019 s mercurial temperament clearly has the Mexicans worried that he could do something rash ( similar to Iran \u2019 s fears about Reagan if the hostages weren \u2019 t released before he was inaugurated ) .\nBut it \u2019 s unlikely that these things would be enough to move a sometimes touchy nationalist like AMLO . Rather , I think a big part of the explanation is that the current flow of illegals is mainly made up of foreigners , not Mexicans . Earlier waves of mass infiltration across our southern border consisted mainly of Mexicans , and while Mexico quickly took back its people who had been nabbed by the Border Patrol , it did little if anything to reduce the flow . They did establish a police-like unit of the country \u2019 s immigration agency called Grupo Beta , which worked on Mexico \u2019 s northern border ( opposite our southern border ) , but its remit was to help potential illegals with water and first aid and protect them from criminals .\nBut the current flow is very different . Yes , there are still a significant number of Mexicans sneaking across the border , but fewer than there used to be . Mexico \u2019 s economy has grown and developed to a point where fewer people see the need to emigrate . Also , there just aren \u2019 t that many able-bodied , working-aged people left in rural areas of Mexico , which is now about as urbanized as the U.S .\nThe current illegal flow , by contrast , is mainly non-Mexican , mostly from Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador ( the \u201c northern triangle \u201d countries of Central America ) , but with growing numbers from Haiti , Cuba , various African countries , and even the Middle East . There had always been a small number of what the Border Patrol calls OTMs ( Other Than Mexicans ) , but they now constitute the majority of the flow .\nWhen the first caravan to catch the world \u2019 s attention passed through Mexican towns on its way north in spring 2018 , it was often welcomed with mariachi bands , offers of food and water , and even medical checkups . But as more caravans arrived , plus many migrants in smaller groups , all drawn by loopholes in American law that facilitated their release into the U.S. , the welcome started to wear out . As the Washington Post wrote this spring :\nBut six months and several caravans later , much of that welcome has dried up . Most media have left .
