But there were some signs Monday that tensions are mounting .\nResidents told CNN that armed militants seized the police station in Kramatorsk , Ukraine , late Monday .

MUST WATCH Security group 's mission in Ukraine 03:01\nThe government of acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov has talked tough but done little to curb pro-Russian activities in the east , possibly afraid that a crackdown could send Russian forces across the border . The occupation of buildings continued in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern Ukraine .\nInternational monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe met Monday with pro-Russian leaders in Slaviansk , but no breakthroughs were reported .\nThe monitors were called for in the agreement among Russia , the United States and the European Union last week that was meant to reduce tensions in the region , which while part of Ukraine has long looked toward Russia for cultural and economic ties .\nIn three towns , pro-Russian protesters and militants have made it clear to CNN they have no intention of moving until the `` illegal '' government in Kiev also moves out of official buildings .\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed those sentiments Monday , saying that Ukrainian officials were not implementing the agreement negotiated in Geneva , Switzerland .\n`` On the contrary , not a single step has been taken by those who have seized power in Kiev to eliminate the reasons of this deep crisis inside Ukraine , '' he said .\nRussia has said before that it holds no sway over pro-Russian protesters and militants .\nGeoffrey Pyatt , the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , told CNN 's Candy Crowley on Sunday that he has seen progress . He had just met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia and the ambassador who heads the OSCE 's special monitoring mission , along with his European Union and Russian counterparts .\n`` I think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the Geneva framework a success , '' he said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` There are obviously some real challenges at this point , '' including the violence in Slaviansk .\n`` But we also believe that there has been some progress . I 'm seeing reports this morning that at least one of these ( occupied ) government buildings now has a Ukrainian flag flying over it , '' he said . `` And the OSCE has monitors on the ground who are reaching out , engaging with local political elites , seeing if there 's a way to de-escalate the crisis . ''\nThere is `` no military solution '' to the crisis , Pyatt said . `` It has to be solved through diplomacy . ''\nMeanwhile , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived Monday in Kiev to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine and deliver a new aid package aimed at shoring up the Ukrainian government .\nThe bundle includes new economic and energy aid as well as governance assistance , a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing Monday .\nIt 's likely to sit well with Ukrainian leaders struggling to keep their country going amid widespread financial problems and a growing showdown with Russia over that country 's annexation of Crimea and troubles in Ukraine 's pro-Russian east .\nOn the streets of Kiev , ordinary citizens said they know there 's only so much the United States can do . Some said they 'd like to see the U.S. send troops .\n`` Our army is very bad . Maybe the U.S. can give us some military help , '' one Ukrainian said .\nBut others say that 's too much , even with pro-Russian forces occupying government buildings in the east and thousands of Russian troops massed along the Ukrainian border .\n`` I think we want consultations , but no American troops , '' another Ukrainian citizen told CNN .\nU.S. officials have ruled out the possibility of deploying U.S. forces to Ukraine .\nBut some U.S. lawmakers have argued that the United States should send weapons .\nThat would n't help the situation and might make it worse , U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper '' on Monday .\nIt wo n't take sending weapons , Rhodes said , to send a message to Russia .\n`` We 've signaled how we can escalate our sanctions , '' he said . `` In the long run , if Russia runs this play , they 're going to lose a lot . ''\nSpeaking to CNN from Kiev on Monday , Rep. Ed Royce said the United States needs to do more to reduce Ukraine 's reliance on natural gas and oil from Russia by exporting fuel there from the United States .\n`` What has put Putin in the driver 's seat over here is the fact that he controls oil and gas . He 's got a monopoly on it , '' the California Republican said . `` And that would be something we could upset . ''\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week that the United States , however , will continue its beefed-up presence in Poland because of the crisis . Among fellow members of NATO , Poland has expressed particular concern about Russian plans in Ukraine .\nThe Defense Department is also sending some nonlethal aid to Ukrainian security forces , including medical supplies , helmets , shelters and water purification equipment .",

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted Hide Caption 168 of 168\n\nDiplomatic efforts\n\nThe government of acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov has talked tough but done little to curb pro-Russian activities in the east, possibly afraid that a crackdown could send Russian forces across the border. The occupation of buildings continued in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern Ukraine.\n\nInternational monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe met Monday with pro-Russian leaders in Slaviansk, but no breakthroughs were reported.\n\nThe monitors were called for in the agreement among Russia, the United States and the European Union last week that was meant to reduce tensions in the region, which while part of Ukraine has long looked toward Russia for cultural and economic ties.\n\nIn three towns, pro-Russian protesters and militants have made it clear to CNN they have no intention of moving until the \"illegal\" government in Kiev also moves out of official buildings.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed those sentiments Monday, saying that Ukrainian officials were not implementing the agreement negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n\"On the contrary, not a single step has been taken by those who have seized power in Kiev to eliminate the reasons of this deep crisis inside Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nRussia has said before that it holds no sway over pro-Russian protesters and militants.\n\nGeoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday that he has seen progress. He had just met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia and the ambassador who heads the OSCE's special monitoring mission, along with his European Union and Russian counterparts.\n\n\"I think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the Geneva framework a success,\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There are obviously some real challenges at this point,\" including the violence in Slaviansk.\n\n\"But we also believe that there has been some progress. I'm seeing reports this morning that at least one of these (occupied) government buildings now has a Ukrainian flag flying over it,\" he said. \"And the OSCE has monitors on the ground who are reaching out, engaging with local political elites, seeing if there's a way to de-escalate the crisis.\"\n\nThere is \"no military solution\" to the crisis, Pyatt said. \"It has to be solved through diplomacy.\"\n\nBiden visits Kiev\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived Monday in Kiev to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine and deliver a new aid package aimed at shoring up the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe bundle includes new economic and energy aid as well as governance assistance, a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing Monday.\n\nIt's likely to sit well with Ukrainian leaders struggling to keep their country going amid widespread financial problems and a growing showdown with Russia over that country's annexation of Crimea and troubles in Ukraine's pro-Russian east.\n\nOn the streets of Kiev, ordinary citizens said they know there's only so much the United States can do. Some said they'd like to see the U.S. send troops.\n\n\"Our army is very bad. Maybe the U.S. can give us some military help,\" one Ukrainian said.\n\nBut others say that's too much, even with pro-Russian forces occupying government buildings in the east and thousands of Russian troops massed along the Ukrainian border.\n\n\"I think we want consultations, but no American troops,\" another Ukrainian citizen told CNN.\n\nU.S. officials have ruled out the possibility of deploying U.S. forces to Ukraine.\n\nBut some U.S. lawmakers have argued that the United States should send weapons.\n\nThat wouldn't help the situation and might make it worse, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" on Monday.\n\nIt won't take sending weapons, Rhodes said, to send a message to Russia.\n\n\"We've signaled how we can escalate our sanctions,\" he said. \"In the long run, if Russia runs this play, they're going to lose a lot.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN from Kiev on Monday, Rep. Ed Royce said the United States needs to do more to reduce Ukraine's reliance on natural gas and oil from Russia by exporting fuel there from the United States.\n\n\"What has put Putin in the driver's seat over here is the fact that he controls oil and gas. He's got a monopoly on it,\" the California Republican said. \"And that would be something we could upset.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week that the United States, however, will continue its beefed-up presence in Poland because of the crisis. Among fellow members of NATO, Poland has expressed particular concern about Russian plans in Ukraine.\n\nThe Defense Department is also sending some nonlethal aid to Ukrainian security forces, including medical supplies, helmets, shelters and water purification equipment.",
