''\nIn a 5-4 decision , the court upheld the law and found that the so-called individual mandate is constitutional under Congress ' taxing power but not under the commerce clause of the Constitution , as the government originally had argued .\nRepublicans -- including presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- claimed the mandate should be seen as a tax increase . Obama had previously rejected the idea that the mandate amounts to a tax .\nRomney lashed out at the ruling and the president , claiming the law 's provisions to impose a penalty on those who are n't insured amounts to a tax increase .

( It ) would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command . The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance . ( It ) is therefore constitutional , because it can reasonably be read as a tax . ''\n`` Here 's the bottom line now , '' said Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. `` It is constitutional according to the Supreme Court because it is a tax increase ... now millions of Americans will have an IRS problem beginning in 2014 . ''\nRepublicans likely will use the tax argument as a battle cry on the campaign trail as Romney quickly repeated his vow to repeal the law if he is elected president .\n`` What the court did not do on its last day of session , I will do on my first day if I am elected president of the United States , '' Romney said Thursday . `` I will act to repeal Obamacare .
