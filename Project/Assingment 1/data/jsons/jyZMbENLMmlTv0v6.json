    "content": "Welcome to a 2016 Republican presidential primary unlike any other . A crowded field , angry electorate and uncharacteristically divided establishment , not to mention the wild-card role of super PACs , have already made this nominating contest more frenzied and unpredictable than its recent predecessors . It \u2019 s become conventional wisdom that , whatever the chaos of the early campaign , a winner is most likely to emerge by mid-March . This cycle , we can \u2019 t be so sure . In fact , the better you understand how the 2016 calendar works , the more likely it seems we can face a messy slog that runs into late spring and possibly even into the July convention\u2014an unlikely fate at this point but one that \u2019 s no longer impossible .\nFor starters , the 2016 calendar quite deliberately avoids having a mid-March nominee .\nIn past cycles\u20142008 , 2000 and 1996\u2014the eventual GOP nominees won quickly by concentrating their attention on the first four or five state contests , leveraging their momentum into a front-loaded Super Tuesday and becoming inevitable by early to mid-March . After the 2008 GOP primary , in which 34 states voted by February 5 , Republican Party leaders concluded that the frontloaded calendar had given John McCain a too-early primary win and allowed the Obama-Clinton primary to capture a lopsided share of attention . In response , those GOP leaders pushed through new calendar rules designed to create a longer , more contested race : They encouraged states to push their primaries later , and required states voting during the first two weeks of March to agree to allocate their delegates proportionally according to the voting results , rather than in a winner-take-all fashion , making those contests far less decisive . ( The period is two weeks shorter in 2016 than it was in 2012 , but about as many delegates will be chosen . )\nThe 2012 presidential election was the first time the new rules took effect , and they dramatically prolonged the primary season . In every election since 1996 , the GOP had settled on a clear nominee in March\u2014as early as March 4 , in McCain \u2019 s case . Although Mitt Romney did as well as any of his predecessors early on in the 2012 primary\u2014effectively tying Iowa , winning New Hampshire , losing South Carolina , and then winning Florida and Nevada\u2014he didn \u2019 t have enough delegates to secure the nomination until April 24 , after 41 states had voted . Critics blamed Romney \u2019 s long slog on weakness as a candidate , but the changes in the primary calendar certainly played a major role .\nThe 2016 rules are much the same as the ones that dragged out Romney \u2019 s victory , but the circumstances of the race all point to a longer , harder fight . Traditionally , the Republican nominee is known when more than 68 percent of the delegates have been chosen , which won \u2019 t happen until April 19 this year . On top of that , the race itself is far more complex than it was in 2012 : Romney \u2019 s anti-establishment challengers petered out relatively quickly , while the two candidates currently leading the polls this year\u2014Donald Trump and Ted Cruz\u2014are themselves anti-establishment candidates , and are continuing to gain momentum just as the voting season begins .\nWhat can we expect along the winding path ahead ? This will be my seventh cycle working in presidential politics , including previously as a lawyer for the Republican National Committee and then on George W. Bush \u2019 s , Mitt Romney \u2019 s and Scott Walker \u2019 s presidential campaigns . More than any of the other primary seasons I \u2019 ve seen , this is the year to expect the unexpected .\nFor the candidates , the primary calendar is like a giant jigsaw puzzle . They \u2019 ll need victories in order to gain credibility , and resources in order to pick up the 1,237 delegates that make for a majority ( having the most votes doesn \u2019 t always mean getting the most delegates ) . They \u2019 ll need to decide whether to run statewide campaigns , mostly through TV ads , or use advanced data techniques to target specific places\u2014whether through ads , old-fashioned door-knocking or other techniques .\nFor the rest of us who are following along , the solution to that jigsaw puzzle may be just as confounding . Beginning in Iowa on February 1 , voters will determine whether GOP officials will get their wish of knowing the nominee by March 22 , or whether the Law of Unintended Consequences will create an unusually divisive , long and inconclusive primary season that becomes a gift for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders .\nAs we prepare for 19 weeks of voting , here \u2019 s an insider \u2019 s look at how major calendar moments could bring the nominating process to an end\u2014or carry the chaos over to yet another contested round .\n4 states ; 133 delegates chosen , 5.4 percent of the total\nThe 1996 , 2000 and 2008 primaries taught campaigns to dump resources into Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and Nevada , four states whose symbolic value far outweighs their delegate count . Winning them is best . But beating expectations is almost as good\u2014it \u2019 s why you see the 2016 establishment candidates , well behind Trump and Cruz in the polls , beating up each other instead of the frontrunners . Early success brings the transfusion of dollars and volunteers essential to amassing delegates in March and beyond . The 2012 calendar changes and Romney \u2019 s experience have diminished the February states \u2019 impact , leaving Super Tuesday on March 1 as the more crucial battle . But the four early states are still a determining factor for the rest of the primary .\nWinning two of the first four states will be a huge boost to any campaign . Winning three of four is the only scenario that could produce a March nominee , and right now , Trump and Cruz are the only candidates who look to have a chance to do that . At minimum , February should clarify the number of GOP primary lanes\u2014whether there \u2019 s a \u201c Trump \u201d lane in addition to the traditional \u201c establishment \u201d and \u201c conservative \u201d lanes .\nAn oddity of the 2016 race is the absence of a consensus establishment candidate this close to voting\u2014especially since that candidate has won every contested primary since 1968 . Even rarer is that no establishment candidate is within range of Trump and Cruz in Iowa or New Hampshire . Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich can take some solace in remembering that Newt Gingrich won the 2012 South Carolina primary without first coming close in either Iowa or New Hampshire . But that \u2019 s far from guaranteed . The establishment \u2019 s weakness could provide a ( rare ) quick win for a candidate from the conservative or Trump lanes , or allow more candidates to win delegates so that the contest continues for longer than is historically the case . As a matter of simple math , the prospect of viable candidates from three ideological lanes rather than two increases the chances of a contested convention .\n12 states ; 624 delegates chosen , 31 percent of the total cumulatively\nAfter February \u2019 s primaries\u2014essentially , four statewide races\u2014the nominating contest becomes a national delegate hunt . Only 10 primaries , with 16.2 percent of the delegates , are true winner-take-all states , in which the top vote getter receives all the delegates . The rest of the states allow multiple candidates to win their delegates by choosing them in one of three ways : proportionally ( 31 states or territories , amounting to 54.5 percent of delegates ) ; by congressional district , with the statewide winner getting at-large delegates ( 10 states , 24.8 percent of delegates ) ; or in a caucus or convention ( five states , 4.5 percent of delegates ) .\nMarch awards the most delegates of any month , with 12 diverse states\u2014primarily from the South but also Alaska , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Vermont and Wyoming\u2014voting in proportional contests on Super Tuesday . These contests will no doubt winnow the field . The question is whether more than two candidates will survive the primaries \u2019 first Demolition Derby .\nTo a large extent , that depends how well the campaigns find ways to say they won and their competitors lost , which means March 1-2 will be the cycle \u2019 s most competitive spin days . A number of candidates are likely to claim \u201c victory \u201d and viability , based on everything from winning the most states , delegates , congressional districts or delegates in different regions to having the greatest consistent finishes in multiple states to being the leading candidate in the establishment wing . Creativity will know no bounds .\nRight now , Trump and Cruz look like a lock to pick up delegates on Super Tuesday . But a decisive factor for the rest primary is whether Rubio , Bush , Christie or Kasich can do well enough for the establishment forces to awaken and coalesce around one candidate .\nMeanwhile , the stakes are obviously going to get higher at this point : If no candidate puts the nomination away , every day will bring gut-wrenching choices for the surviving campaigns as money and human resources ebb and flow and become pieces on the primary calendar chessboard .\n11 states ; 356 delegates chosen , 45 percent of the total cumulatively\nThis stretch of the nominating process isn \u2019 t likely to change much .\nOf the eleven states that vote from March 5-12 , only Michigan awards more than 50 delegates . So unless one candidate runs the table on March 1 , there will not be a presumptive nominee by March 12 . Just 45 percent of the delegates will be decided by this point , all of them ( except South Carolina ) chosen proportionally . That means even a candidate winning 40 percent of the vote across the board will have amassed only 451 delegates , or 34 percent of those needed to win . ( For some perspective , Trump is currently polling at about 35 percent . )\nIn a multi-candidate field , that \u2019 s reason for multiple candidates to continue after March 12 . The campaigns \u2019 main challenge at this point will be how successfully they claim they \u2019 re winning or still in the race . In 2016 , the stakes are likely to be higher for the establishment candidates still in the race at this point . The pressure from elected officials and donors will mount on those who have no hope of winning a majority of delegates to agree on a single candidate to challenge Trump and/or Cruz . Yet it \u2019 s also possible that the trailing three establishment candidates will see a contested convention on the horizon , and decide to continue trying to win delegates to gain leverage at that convention .\n5 states ; 357 delegates chosen , 60 percent of the total cumulatively\nNot enough delegates are chosen between March 16 and April 19 to alter the dynamics of a race . So either a presumptive nominee emerges from the voting on March 15 , or the long , cold primary season is destined to continue for at least five more weeks .\nFive big states hold contests on this day , providing campaigns with divergent paths to win delegates . March 15 features the first true winner-take-all statewide primaries ( Florida and Ohio ) ; the direct election of individual delegates in congressional districts ( Illinois ) ; a winner-take-all contest by congressional district ( Missouri ) ; and a proportional statewide primary with no minimum threshold to win delegates ( North Carolina ) .\nIn Florida , Bush last year convinced the legislature to make the state a true winner-take-all before Rubio appeared to be a threat . Now it \u2019 s hard see either Bush or Rubio going on to win the nomination if he loses his home state , making Florida a death cage competition between the two\u2014or a huge opportunity for a third candidate to knock out both and run away with 99 delegates . Florida will also be the most expensive state ; California and Texas are not statewide winner-take-alls , so candidates can target their resources to pick up delegates . But while Bush and Rubio will have to spend what it takes to win here , the other candidates\u2014if they operate on the assumption that Bush and Rubio have home court advantage\u2014don \u2019 t have to spend time or money competing in Florida .\nSimilar to Bush , Kasich last year made his state of Ohio true winner-take-all contest . If Kasich is still in the race at this point , no other candidate needs to spend a dime in his state , unless they see an opportunity to knock out the governor . Even if he fares poorly earlier in the primaries , Kasich could stay in the race just to win Ohio \u2019 s 66 delegates ; since he controls the state mechanisms enough to be able to control a block of delegates , he could become one of the convention \u2019 s only real \u201c brokers . \u201d",
