    "content": "Since the publication of his attorney general \u2019 s short report on the outcome of the Mueller investigation , Donald Trump has looked like a president unleashed . He has attacked his enemies , demanded the resignation of journalists who he says peddled \u201c fake news \u201d , and advanced controversial policies on health and immigration . With a cloud over his presidency lifted , he is free to act like never before . Meanwhile , Democrats feel under pressure to move on to discussing other issues or risk looking like McCarthyite obsessives .\nSuch , anyway , is the conventional wisdom . But what if it is wrong ?\nWhen Trump is caught red-handed in a lie or scandal , he has a time-worn playbook for weathering it . First , he lies about the facts of the matter , attempting to create enough uncertainty to inoculate his base and a portion of the rest of the population against accepting the reality of what has happened . Second , he pivots to attacking his antagonists ( which in the past have included a dead senator , the father of a fallen soldier , and judges of Mexican heritage ) . Finally , he tries to change the subject .\nFar from Trump emerging into a new phase of his presidency with the release of the Barr report , he has in fact lapsed into this age-old pattern . Phases one and two came quickly , with Trump and his surrogates claiming that the president had been completely exonerated even though Mueller explicitly did not make this judgment . They then accused the media and Democrats of corruptly conspiring to bring down the president .\nBefore we can move on from the Mueller report , we need to know much more\nBut it is the next part of the administration \u2019 s response , phase three , which is so uniquely Trumpian . The president has frequently managed to survive scandals that might have felled other politicians because he is so adept at changing the conversation by sparking a new furor , which eclipses the old one . The result has been a presidency of serial scandals which can easily induce a sense of numbness in his opponents , while making himself appear invulnerable to any particular one of the hundreds of controversies encircling him .\nSince the release of the Barr report , Trump has attempted to change the topic in two ways . The first is on healthcare . Last Monday , the Trump administration filed a letter in a Texas court declaring that it would like to see the entirety of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as Obamacare \u2013 declared unconstitutional . Backing a wacky legal challenge that has been levied against the ACA , the administration is advocating stripping healthcare benefits from tens of millions of Americans with no plan for how to provide them with alternative coverage . Although the move is a sure political loser for Republicans , Trump charged ahead anyway .\nSecond , Trump has stepped up his anti-immigrant rhetoric and threatened to close the US border with Mexico , another self-destructive move which would harm millions of Americans . Nearly $ 1.7bn in commerce flows over the border daily , and automakers and farmers \u2013 exactly the Americans who Trump claims to stand up for \u2013 would be most affected by the closure . It would also undermine cooperation with Mexico , which is necessary to handle the migrant crisis . For good measure , Trump announced last week that he would cut off aid to Central American countries that need it in order to stem the flow of refugees .\nCongress must investigate Trump .

Instead , they need to stay focused on obtaining a full copy of the Mueller report and making its contents known to the public .\nIn 2016 , the integrity of America \u2019 s electoral process was attacked by a foreign power . Since that time , the president and his allies have engaged in a sinister and baffling pattern of behavior designed to hide their own connections to that power . All we know so far is that Mueller was not able to prove that they criminally colluded with Russia , and that he was unable to exonerate the president of criminally obstructing the inquiry .

It is about establishing the principle that America has a president , not a king , and that the president is bound by the rule of law . It is about returning a bare modicum of accountability to American public life after years of congressional Republicans shirking their constitutional duty to hold the executive branch to account . It is about finding out exactly how American national security was compromised in 2016 , and why the president and his surrogates are so keen to pretend it wasn \u2019 t .
