    "content": "I get really really tired of hearing the phrase \u201c mental illness \u201d thrown around as a way to avoid saying other terms like \u201c toxic masculinity , \u201d \u201c white supremacy , \u201d \u201c misogyny \u201d or \u201c racism . \u201d\nWe barely know anything about the suspect in the Charleston , South Carolina , atrocity . We certainly don \u2019 t have testimony from a mental health professional responsible for his care that he suffered from any specific mental illness , or that he suffered from a mental illness at all .\nWe do have statistics showing that the vast majority of people who commit acts of violence do not have a diagnosis of mental illness and , conversely , people who have mental illness are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators .\nWe know that the stigma of people who suffer from mental illness as scary , dangerous potential murderers hurts people every single day -- it costs people relationships and jobs , it scares people away from seeking help who need it , it brings shame and fear down on the heads of people who already have it bad enough .\nBut the media insists on trotting out \u201c mental illness \u201d and blaring out that phrase nonstop in the wake of any mass killing . I had to grit my teeth every time I personally debated someone defaulting to the mindless mantra of \u201c The real issue is mental illness \u201d over the Isla Vista shootings .\n\u201c The real issue is mental illness \u201d is a goddamn cop-out . I almost never hear it from actual mental health professionals , or advocates working in the mental health sphere , or anyone who actually has any kind of informed opinion on mental health or serious policy proposals for how to improve our treatment of the mentally ill in this country .\nWhat I hear from people who bleat on about \u201c The real issue is mental illness , \u201d when pressed for specific suggestions on how to deal with said \u201c real issue , \u201d is terrifying nonsense designed to throw the mentally ill under the bus . Elliot Rodger \u2019 s parents should \u2019 ve been able to force risperidone down his throat . Seung-Hui Cho should \u2019 ve been forcibly institutionalized . Anyone with a mental illness diagnosis should surrender all of their constitutional rights , right now , rather than at all compromise the right to bear arms of self-declared sane people .\nWhat \u2019 s interesting is to watch who the mentally ill people are being thrown under the bus to defend . In the wake of Sandy Hook , the NRA tells us that creating a national registry of firearms owners would be giving the government dangerously unchecked tyrannical power , but a national registry of the mentally ill would not -- even though a \u201c sane \u201d person holding a gun is intrinsically more dangerous than a \u201c crazy \u201d person , no matter how crazy , without a gun .\nWe \u2019 ve successfully created a world so topsy-turvy that seeking medical help for depression or anxiety is apparently stronger evidence of violent tendencies than going out and purchasing a weapon whose only purpose is committing acts of violence . We \u2019 ve got a narrative going where doing the former is something we \u2019 re OK with stigmatizing but not the latter . God bless America .\nWhat \u2019 s also interesting is the way \u201c The real issue is mental illness \u201d is deployed against mass murderers the way it \u2019 s deployed in general -- as a way to discredit their own words . When you call someone \u201c mentally ill \u201d in this culture it \u2019 s a way to admonish people not to listen to them , to ignore anything they say about their own actions and motivations , to give yourself the authority to say you know them better than they know themselves .\nThis is cruel , ignorant bullshit when it \u2019 s used to discredit people who are the victims of crimes . It is , in fact , one major factor behind the fact that the mentally ill are far more likely to be the targets of violence than the perpetrators -- every predator loves a victim who won \u2019 t be allowed to speak in their own defense .\nBut it \u2019 s also bullshit when used to discredit the perpetrators of crimes . Mass murderers frequently aren \u2019 t particularly shy about the motives behind what they do -- the nature of the crime they commit is attention-seeking , is an attempt to get news coverage for their cause , to use one local atrocity to create fear within an entire population . ( According to the dictionary , by the way , this is called \u201c terrorism , \u201d but we only ever seem to use that word for the actions of a certain kind -- by which I mean a certain color -- of mass killer . )\nElliot Rodger told us why he did what he did , at great length , in detail and with citations to the \u201c redpill \u201d websites from which he got his deranged ideology . It isn \u2019 t , at the end of the day , rocket science -- he killed women because he resented them for not sleeping with him , and he killed men because he resented them for having the success he felt he was denied .\nYes , whatever mental illness he may have had contributed to the way his beliefs were at odds with reality . But it didn \u2019 t cause his beliefs to spring like magic from inside his brain with no connection to the outside world .\nThat \u2019 s as deliberately obtuse as reading the Facebook rants of a man who rambled on at great length about how much he hated religion and in particular hated Islam and deciding that the explanation for his murdering a Muslim family is that he must \u2019 ve just \u201c gone crazy \u201d over a parking dispute .\nNow we \u2019 ve got a man who wore symbols of solidarity with apartheid regimes , a man who lived in a culture surrounded by deadly weapons who , like many others , received a gift of a deadly weapon as a rite of passage into manhood .\nHe straight-up told his victims , before shooting them , that he was doing it to defend \u201c our country \u201d from black people \u201c taking over. \u201d He told a woman that he was intentionally sparing her life so she could tell people what he did .\nThere is no reasonable interpretation of his actions that don \u2019 t make this a textbook act of terrorism against black Americans as a community .\nAnd yet almost immediately we \u2019 ve heard the same , tired refrain of \u201c The real issue is mental illness . \u201d\nWell , \u201c mental illness \u201d never created any idea , motivation or belief system . \u201c Mental illness \u201d refers to the way our minds can distort the ideas we get from the world , but the ideas still come from somewhere .\nOne of the highest-profile cases of full-blown schizophrenia in history is that of John Nash , who , unlike the vast , vast majority of mentally ill people , really did develop a whole system of delusions entirely separate from reality . And yet even then the movie A Beautiful Mind whitewashes what those beliefs actually were -- when he came up with an all-powerful conspiracy that was monitoring his every move , that conspiracy by sheer coincidence was a conspiracy of the world \u2019 s Jews .\nWas it just sheer bad luck for Jewish people that a random genius \u2019 random fertile imagination made them into demonic villains ? Or did he get that idea from somewhere ?\nMisogynistic rants that exactly match Elliot Rodger \u2019 s are just a Google search away , if you have a strong stomach . So are racist threats that exactly match Dylann Roof \u2019 s . Are all those people \u201c mentally ill \u201d ? And if so is there some pill you could distribute to cure it ?\nDylann Roof is a fanboy of the South African and Rhodesian governments . As horrific as Roof \u2019 s crime was , the crimes that occurred over decades of apartheid rule were far , far worse , and committed by thousands of statesmen , bureaucrats and law enforcement officials . Were all of them also \u201c mentally ill \u201d ? At the risk of Godwinning myself , John Nash wasn \u2019 t the only person to think the Jews were a global demonic conspiracy out to get him -- at one point in history a large portion of the Western world bought into that and killed six million people because of it . Were they all \u201c mentally ill \u201d ?\nEven when violence stems purely from delusion in the mind of someone who \u2019 s genuinely totally detached from reality -- which is extremely rare -- that violence seems to have a way of finding its way to culturally approved targets . Yeah , most white supremacists aren \u2019 t \u201c crazy \u201d enough to go on a shooting spree , most misogynists aren \u2019 t \u201c crazy \u201d enough to murder women who turn them down , most anti-government zealots aren \u2019 t \u201c crazy \u201d enough to shoot up or blow up government buildings .\nBut the \u201c crazy \u201d ones always seem to have a respectable counterpart who makes a respectable living pumping out the rhetoric that ends up in the \u201c crazy \u201d one \u2019 s manifesto -- drawing crosshairs on liberals and calling abortion doctors mass murderers -- who , once an atrocity happens , then immediately throws the \u201c crazy \u201d person under the bus for taking their words too seriously , too literally .\nAnd the big splashy headliner atrocities tend to distract us from the ones that don \u2019 t make headline news . People are willing to call one white man emptying five magazines and murdering nine black people in a church and openly saying it was because of race a hate crime , even if they have to then cover it up with the fig leaf of individual \u201c mental illness \u201d -- but a white man wearing a uniform who fires two magazines at two people in a car in a \u201c bad neighborhood \u201d in Cleveland ? That just ends up a statistic in a DoJ report on systemic bias .\nAnd hundreds of years of history in which an entire country \u2019 s economy was set up around chaining up millions of black people , forcing them to work and shooting them if they get out of line ? That \u2019 s just history .\nThe reason a certain kind of person loves talking about \u201c mental illness \u201d is to draw attention to the big bold scary exceptional crimes and treat them as exceptions . It \u2019 s to distract from the fact that the worst crimes in history were committed by people just doing their jobs -- cops enforcing the law , soldiers following orders , bureaucrats signing paperwork . That if we define \u201c sanity \u201d as going along to get along with what \u2019 s \u201c normal \u201d in the society around you , then for most of history the sane thing has been to aid and abet monstrous evil .\nWe love to talk about individuals \u2019 mental illness so we can avoid talking about the biggest , scariest problem of all -- societal illness . That the danger isn \u2019 t any one person \u2019 s madness , but that the world we live in is mad .",
