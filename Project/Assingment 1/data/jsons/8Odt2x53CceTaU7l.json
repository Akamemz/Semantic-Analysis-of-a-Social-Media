    "content": "Climate change skeptics are doing a bit of gloating following a series of mainstream media reports that acknowledge what those skeptics have long held -- the earth is not warming , at least not in the last 10 years .\n`` The idea that CO2 is the tail that wags the dog is no longer scientifically tenable , '' said Marc Morano of ClimateDepot.com , a website devoted to countering the prevailing acceptance of man-made global warming .\nIn recent weeks , Der Spiegel , the Telegraph and the Economist have reported the unexpected stabilizing of global surface temperatures . Even former NASA scientist and outspoken climate change activist James Hansen has acknowledged the 10-year lull .\nMorano said : `` In the peer-reviewed literature we 're finding hundreds of factors influence global temperature , everything from ocean cycles to the tilt of the earth 's axis to water vapor , methane , cloud feedback , volcanic dust , all of these factors are coming together . They 're now realizing it was n't the simple story we 've been told of your SUV is creating a dangerously warm planet . ''\nMany climate scientists and environmentalists agree with Morano 's description of climate complexity , but reject his denials of global warming as a problem .\n`` This is a highly complex calculation to make in the first place . The short period of time , only 10 years in which the increasing temperature has leveled , really does n't tell us very much other than the fact that temperatures may still be rising but just not as fast as they were before , '' said Elgie Holstein , the senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former assistant secretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n`` What 's compelling about the climate science , '' Holstein said , `` is that we have literally thousands of the world 's leading scientists around the country pretty much saying the same thing about where we 're headed , and it 's not reassuring . ''\nBut the surface temperature stabilization suggests that computer models which predict harsh consequences of global warming may need reassessing .\nAs The Economist put it on March 30 , `` It may be that the climate is responding to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in ways that had not been properly understood before . This possibility , if true , could have profound significance both for climate science and for environmental and social policy . ''\nIndeed , no one disputes that levels of carbon dioxide are increasing globally , but CO2 's impact has not been as great as many scientists had predicted .\n`` In the peer-reviewed literature , they 've tried to explain away this lull , '' said Morano . `` In the proceedings of the National Academy of Science a year or two ago they had a study blaming Chinese coal use for the lack of global warming . So , in an ironic twist , global warming proponents are now claiming that that coal use is saving us from dangerous global warming . ''\nHolstein believes the temperature lull is not entirely unexpected or unpredicted .\n`` We 're within ranges of these climate models that are saying we 're still on track to some pretty troublesome impacts if we do n't do something about it , '' he said .\nA Gallup survey conducted March 7-10 found 58 percent of Americans say they worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming .\nThat was up from 51 percent in 2011 -- but still below the 62-72 percent levels seen between 1999 and 2001 .",
