Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) that would restore the subsidies for current Obamacare enrollees through September 2017 . But the administration would have to pay a heavy price \u2014 the bill would also repeal Obamacare \u2019 s individual and employer mandates and insurance coverage requirements .\n\u201c In that moment of what could be political chaos , we \u2019 re offering such a reasonable proposal that solves a mess , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c It fixes a mess caused by a sloppily written law , unlawfully implemented . All we \u2019 re asking for is a little bit of freedom back , which would be , I think , pretty popular , \u201d Johnson said . Even Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) is backing Johnson \u2019 s measure , along with the rest of the chamber \u2019 s GOP leaders .\nJohnson , who \u2019 s got a tight race in 2016 , says the legislation would be a bridge to ensure that consumers can keep the insurance they have \u2014 a promise that President Barack Obama was widely criticized for breaking in 2014 .\nBut even if Johnson could somehow persuade Obama and Senate Democrats to accept his plan \u2014 a herculean task \u2014 the bigger problem will be his Republican colleagues in the House .\nThe growing divide between the two chambers leaves the GOP in an awkward spot . The court could gut Obamacare in June , handing Republicans a long-sought victory they couldn \u2019 t achieve legislatively . But without a backup plan that the whole party supports , the GOP has no way to blunt the political damage if millions of Americans lose the ability to pay for their health insurance .\nWhen asked about Johnson \u2019 s bill , Rep. Matt Salmon ( R-Ariz. ) gave a thumbs-down and , imitating a game-show buzzer , said only \u201c Eerrrrrrntt ! \u201d\nRepublican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores of Texas , who said he is planning to release an Obamacare replacement plan in the coming days , said : \u201c If you \u2019 re voting for an extension , you \u2019 re essentially voting for the continuation of Obamacare \u2014 that \u2019 s a real problem . \u201d\nThe court is expected to hand down a ruling in King v. Burwell in late June . Democratic lawmakers insist that there is no way to undo the damage if the court sides with the challengers , short of passing legislation that simply restores the subsidies .
