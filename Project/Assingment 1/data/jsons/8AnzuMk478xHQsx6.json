    "content": "Have you ever undertaken some task you felt less than qualified for , but knew that someone needed to do ? Consider this piece my version of that , and let me put what I do understand about it in a nutshell : based on developments in our post-9/11 world , we could be watching the birth of a new American political system and way of governing for which , as yet , we have no name .\nAnd here \u2019 s what I find strange : the evidence of this , however inchoate , is all around us and yet it \u2019 s as if we can \u2019 t bear to take it in or make sense of it or even say that it might be so .\nLet me make my case , however minimally , based on five areas in which at least the faint outlines of that new system seem to be emerging : political campaigns and elections ; the privatization of Washington through the marriage of the corporation and the state ; the de-legitimization of our traditional system of governance ; the empowerment of the national security state as an untouchable fourth branch of government ; and the demobilization of `` we the people . ''\nWhatever this may add up to , it seems to be based , at least in part , on the increasing concentration of wealth and power in a new plutocratic class and in that ever-expanding national security state . Certainly , something out of the ordinary is underway , and yet its birth pangs , while widely reported , are generally categorized as aspects of an exceedingly familiar American system somewhat in disarray .\nCheck out the news about the 2016 presidential election and you \u2019 ll quickly feel a sense of been-there , done-that . As a start , the two names most associated with it , Bush and Clinton , couldn \u2019 t be more familiar , highlighting as they do the curiously dynastic quality of recent presidential contests . ( If a Bush or Clinton should win in 2016 and again in 2020 , a member of one of those families will have controlled the presidency for 28 of the last 36 years . )\nTake , for instance , \u201c Why 2016 Is Likely to Become a Close Race , \u201d a recent piece Nate Cohn wrote for my hometown paper . A noted election statistician , Cohn points out that , despite Hillary Clinton \u2019 s historically staggering lead in Democratic primary polls ( and lack of serious challengers ) , she could lose the general election . He bases this on what we know about her polling popularity from the Monica Lewinsky moment of the 1990s to the present . Cohn assures readers that Hillary will not \u201c be a Democratic Eisenhower , a popular , senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory. \u201d It \u2019 s the sort of comparison that offers a certain implicit reassurance about the near future . ( No , Virginia , we haven \u2019 t left the world of politics in which former general and president Dwight D. Eisenhower can still be a touchstone . )\nCohn may be right when it comes to Hillary \u2019 s electability , but this is not Dwight D. Eisenhower \u2019 s or even Al Gore \u2019 s America . If you want a measure of that , consider this year \u2019 s primaries . I mean , of course , the 2015 ones . Once upon a time , the campaign season started with candidates flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire early in the election year to establish their bona fides among party voters . These days , however , those are already late primaries .\nThe early primaries , the ones that count , take place among a small group of millionaires andbillionaires , a new caste flush with cash who will personally , or through complex networks of funders , pour multi-millions of dollars into the campaigns of candidates of their choice . So the early primaries -- this year mainly a Republican affair -- are taking place in resort spots like Las Vegas , Rancho Mirage , California , and Sea Island , Georgia , as has been widely reported . These \u201c contests \u201d involve groveling politicians appearing at the beck and call of the rich and powerful , and so reflect our new 1 % electoral system . ( The main pro-Hillary super PAC , for instance , is aiming for a kitty of $ 500 million heading into 2016 , while the Koch brothers network has already promised to drop almost $ 1 billion into the coming campaign season , doubling their efforts in the last presidential election year . )\nEver since the Supreme Court opened up the ultimate floodgates with its 2010 Citizens United decision , each subsequent election has seen record-breaking amounts of money donated and spent . The 2012 presidential campaign was the first $ 2 billion election ; campaign 2016 is expected to hit the $ 5 billion mark without breaking a sweat . By comparison , according to Burton Abrams and Russell Settle in their study , \u201c The Effect of Broadcasting on Political Campaign Spending , \u201d Republicans and Democrats spent just under $ 13 million combined in 1956 when Eisenhower won his second term .\nIn the meantime , it \u2019 s still true that the 2016 primaries will involve actual voters , as will the election that follows . The previous election season , the midterms of 2014 , cost almost $ 4 billion , a record despite the number of small donors continuing to drop . It also represented the lowest midterm voter turnout since World War II . ( See : demobilization of the public , below -- and add in the demobilization of the Democrats as a real party , the breaking of organized labor , the fragmenting of the Republican Party , and the return of voter suppression laws visibly meant to limit the franchise . ) It hardly matters just what the flood of new money does in such elections , when you can feel the weight of inequality bearing down on the whole process in a way that is pushing us somewhere new .\n2 . The Privatization of the State ( or the U.S. as a Prospective Third-World Nation )\nIn the recent coverage of the Hillary Clinton email flap , you can find endless references to the Clintons of yore in wink-wink , you-know-how-they-are-style reporting ; and yes , she did delete a lot of emails ; and yes , it \u2019 s an election year coming and , as everyone points out , the Republicans are going to do their best to keep the email issue alive until hell freezes over , etc. , etc . Again , the coverage , while eyeball gluing , is in a you \u2019 ve-seen-it-all-before , you \u2019 ll-see-it-all-again-mode .\nHowever , you haven \u2019 t seen it all before . The most striking aspect of this little brouhaha lies in what \u2019 s most obvious but least highlighted . An American secretary of state chose to set up her own private , safeguarded email system for doing government work ; that is , she chose to privatize her communications . If this were Cairo , it might not warrant a second thought . But it didn \u2019 t happen in some third-world state . It was the act of a key official of the planet \u2019 s reigning ( or thrashing ) superpower , which -- even if it wasn \u2019 t the first time such a thing had ever occurred -- should be taken as a tiny symptom of something that couldn \u2019 t be larger or , in the long stretch of history , newer : the ongoing privatization of the American state , or at least the national security part of it .\nThough the marriage of the state and the corporation has a pre-history , the full-scale arrival of the warrior corporation only occurred after 9/11 . Someday , that will undoubtedly be seen as a seminal moment in the formation of whatever may be coming in this country . Only 13 years later , there is no part of the war state that has not experienced major forms of privatization . The U.S. military could no longer go to war without its crony corporationsdoing KP and guard duty , delivering the mail , building the bases , and being involved in just about all of its activities , including training the militaries of foreign allies and even fighting . Such warrior corporations are now involved in every aspect of the national security state , including torture , drone strikes , and -- to the tune of hundreds of thousands of contract employees like Edward Snowden -- intelligence gathering and spying . You name it and , in these years , it \u2019 s been at least partly privatized .\nAll you have to do is read reporter James Risen \u2019 s recent book , Pay Any Price , on how the global war on terror was fought in Washington , and you know that privatization has brought something else with it : corruption , scams , and the gaming of the system for profits of a sort that might normally be associated with a typical third-world kleptocracy . And all of this , a new world being born , was reflected in a tiny way in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s very personal decision about her emails .\nThough it \u2019 s a subject I know so much less about , this kind of privatization ( and the corruption that goes with it ) is undoubtedly underway in the non-war-making , non-security-projecting part of the American state as well .\nOn a third front , American \u201c confidence \u201d in the three classic check-and-balance branches of government , as measured by polling outfits , continues to fall . In 2014 , Americans expressing a \u201c great deal of confidence \u201d in the Supreme Court hit a new low of 23 % ; in the presidency , it was 11 % , and in Congress a bottom-scraping 5 % . ( The military , on the other hand , registers at 50 % . ) The figures for \u201c hardly any confidence at all \u201d are respectively 20 % , 44 % , and more than 50 % . All are in or near record-breaking territory for the last four decades .\nIt seems fair to say that in recent years Congress has been engaged in a process of delegitimizing itself . Where that body once had the genuine power to declare war , for example , it is now \u201c debating \u201d in a desultory fashion an \u201c authorization \u201d for a war against the Islamic State in Syria , Iraq , and possibly elsewhere that has already been underway for eight months and whose course , it seems , will be essentially unaltered , whether Congress authorizes it or not .\nWhat would President Harry Truman , who once famously ran a presidential campaign against a \u201c do-nothing \u201d Congress , have to say about a body that truly can do just about nothing ? Or rather , to give the Republican war hawks in that new Congress their due , not quite nothing . They are proving capable of acting effectively to delegitimize the presidency as well . House Majority Leader John Boehner \u2019 s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to undercut the president 's Iranian nuclear negotiations and the lettersigned by 47 Republican senators and directed to the Iranian ayatollahs are striking examples of this . They are visibly meant to tear down an \u201c imperial presidency \u201d that Republicans gloried in not so long ago .\nThe radical nature of that letter , not as an act of state but of its de-legitimization , was noted even in Iran , where fundamentalist Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei proclaimed it \u201c a sign of a decline in political ethics and the destruction of the American establishment from within. \u201d Here , however , the letter is either being covered as a singularly extreme one-off act ( \u201c treason ! \u201d ) or , as Jon Stewart did on \u201c The Daily Show , \u201d as part of a repetitive tit-for-tat between Democrats and Republicans over who controls foreign policy . It is , in fact , neither . It represents part of a growing pattern in which Congress becomes an ever less effective body , except in its willingness to take on and potentially take out the presidency .\nIn the twenty-first century , all that \u201c small government \u201d Republicans and \u201c big government \u201d Democrats can agree on is offering essentially unconditional support to the military and the national security state . The Republican Party -- its various factions increasingly at each other \u2019 s throats almost as often as at those of the Democrats -- seems reasonably united solely on issues of war-making and security . As for the Democrats , an unpopular administration , facing constant attack by those who loath President Obama , has kept its footing in part by allying with and fusing with the national security state . A president who came into office rejecting torture and promoting sunshine and transparency in government has , in the course of six-plus years , come to identify himself almost totally with the U.S. military , the CIA , the NSA , and the like . While it has launched an unprecedented campaign against whistleblowers and leakers ( as well as sunshine and transparency ) , the Obama White House has proved a powerful enabler of , but also remarkably dependent upon , that state-within-a-state , a strange fate for \u201c the imperial presidency . \u201d\n4 . The Rise of the National Security State as the Fourth Branch of Government\nOne \u201c branch \u201d of government is , however , visibly on the rise and rapidly gaining independence from just about any kind of oversight . Its ability to enact its wishes with almost no opposition in Washington is a striking feature of our moment . But while the symptoms of this process are regularly reported , the overall phenomenon -- the creation of ade facto fourth branch of government -- gets remarkably little attention . In the war on terror era , the national security state has come into its own . Its growth has been phenomenal . Though it \u2019 s seldom pointed out , it should be considered remarkable that in this period we gained a second full-scale \u201c defense department , \u201d the Department of Homeland Security , and that it and the Pentagon have become even more entrenched , each surrounded by its own growing \u201c complex \u201d of private corporations , lobbyists , and allied politicians . The militarization of the country has , in these years , proceeded apace .\nMeanwhile , the duplication to be found in the U.S. Intelligence Community with its 17 major agencies and outfits is staggering . Its growing ability to surveil and spy on a global scale , including on its own citizens , puts the totalitarian states of the twentieth century to shame . That the various parts of the national security state can act in just about any fashion without fear of accountability in a court of law is by now too obvious to belabor . As wealth has traveled upwards in American society in ways not seen since the first Gilded Age , so taxpayer dollars have migrated into the national security state in an almost plutocratic fashion .\nNew reports regularly surface about the further activities of parts of that state . In recent weeks , for instance , we learned from Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley of the Intercept that the CIA has spent years trying to break the encryption on Apple iPhones and iPads ; it has , that is , been aggressively seeking to attack an all-American corporation ( even if significant parts of its production process are actually in China ) . Meanwhile , Devlin Barrett of the Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA , an agency barred from domestic spying operations of any sort , has been helping the U.S . Marshals Service ( part of the Justice Department ) create an airborne digital dragnet on American cell phones . Planes flying out of five U.S. cities carry a form of technology that `` mimics a cellphone tower . '' This technology , developed and tested in distant American war zones and now brought to `` the homeland , '' is just part of the ongoing militarization of the country from its borders to its police forces . And there \u2019 s hardly been a week since Edward Snowden first released crucial NSA documents in June 2013 when such \u201c advances \u201d haven \u2019 t been in the news .\nNews also regularly bubbles up about the further expansion , reorganization , and upgrading of parts of the intelligence world , the sorts of reports that have become the barely noticed background hum of our lives . Recently , for instance , Director John Brennan announced a major reorganization of the CIA meant to break down the classic separation between spies and analysts at the Agency , while creating a new Directorate of Digital Innovation responsible for , among other things , cyberwarfare and cyberespionage . At about the same time , according to the New York Times , the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications , an obscure State Department agency , was given a new and expansive role in coordinating \u201c all the existing attempts at countermessaging [ against online propaganda by terror outfits like the Islamic State ] by much larger federal departments , including the Pentagon , Homeland Security and intelligence agencies . \u201d\nThis sort of thing is par for the course in an era in which the national security state has only grown stronger , endlessly elaborating , duplicating , and overlapping the various parts of its increasingly labyrinthine structure . And keep in mind that , in a structure that has fought hardto keep what it 's doing cloaked in secrecy , there is so much more that we don \u2019 t know . Still , we should know enough to realize that this ongoing process reflects something new in our American world ( even if no one cares to notice ) .\nIn The Age of Acquiescence , a new book about America \u2019 s two Gilded Ages , Steve Fraser asks why it was that , in the nineteenth century , another period of plutocratic excesses , concentration of wealth and inequality , buying of politicians , and attempts to demobilize the public , Americans took to the streets with such determination and in remarkable numbers over long periods of time to protest their treatment , and stayed there even when the brute power of the state was called out against them . In our own moment , Fraser wonders , why has the silence of the public in the face of similar developments been so striking ?\nAfter all , a grim new American system is arising before our eyes . Everything we once learned in the civics textbooks of our childhoods about how our government works now seems askew , while the growth of poverty , the flatlining of wages , the rise of the .01 % , the collapse of labor , and the militarization of society are all evident .\nThe process of demobilizing the public certainly began with the military . It was initially a response to the disruptive and rebellious draftees of the Vietnam-era . In 1973 , at the stroke of a presidential pen , the citizen \u2019 s army was declared no more , the raising of new recruits was turned over to advertising agencies ( a preview of the privatization of the state to come ) , and the public was sent home , never again to meddle in military affairs . Since 2001 , that form of demobilization has been etched in stone and transformed into a way of life in the name of the \u201c safety \u201d and \u201c security \u201d of the public .\nSince then , \u201c we the people \u201d have made ourselves felt in only three disparate ways : from the left in the Occupy movement , which , with its slogans about the 1 % and the 99 % , put the issue of growing economic inequality on the map of American consciousness ; from the right , in the Tea Party movement , a complex expression of discontent backed and at least partially funded by right-wing operatives and billionaires , and aimed at the de-legitimization of the \u201c nanny state \u201d ; and the recent round of post-Ferguson protests spurred at least in part by the militarization of the police in black and brown communities around the country .\nOtherwise , a moment of increasing extremity has also been a moment of -- to use Fraser \u2019 s word -- \u201c acquiescence. \u201d Someday , we \u2019 ll assumedly understand far better how this all came to be . In the meantime , let me be as clear as I can be about something that seems murky indeed : this period doesn \u2019 t represent a version , no matter how perverse or extreme , of politics as usual ; nor is the 2016 campaign an election as usual ; nor are we experiencing Washington as usual . Put together our 1 % elections , the privatization of our government , the de-legitimization of Congress and the presidency , as well as the empowerment of the national security state and the U.S. military , and add in the demobilization of the American public ( in the name of protecting us from terrorism ) , and you have something like a new ballgame .\nWhile significant planning has been involved in all of this , there may be no ruling pattern or design . Much of it may be happening in a purely seat-of-the-pants fashion . In response , there has been no urge to officially declare that something new is afoot , let alone convene a new constitutional convention . Still , don \u2019 t for a second think that the American political system isn \u2019 t being rewritten on the run by interested parties in Congress , our present crop of billionaires , corporate interests , lobbyists , the Pentagon , and the officials of the national security state .\nOut of the chaos of this prolonged moment and inside the shell of the old system , a new culture , a new kind of politics , a new kind of governance is being born right before our eyes . Call it what you want . But call it something . Stop pretending it \u2019 s not happening .",
    "content_original": "Have you ever undertaken some task you felt less than qualified for, but knew that someone needed to do? Consider this piece my version of that, and let me put what I do understand about it in a nutshell: based on developments in our post-9/11 world, we could be watching the birth of a new American political system and way of governing for which, as yet, we have no name.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I find strange: the evidence of this, however inchoate, is all around us and yet it\u2019s as if we can\u2019t bear to take it in or make sense of it or even say that it might be so.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nLet me make my case, however minimally, based on five areas in which at least the faint outlines of that new system seem to be emerging: political campaigns and elections; the privatization of Washington through the marriage of the corporation and the state; the de-legitimization of our traditional system of governance; the empowerment of the national security state as an untouchable fourth branch of government; and the demobilization of \"we the people.\"\n\nWhatever this may add up to, it seems to be based, at least in part, on the increasing concentration of wealth and power in a new plutocratic class and in that ever-expanding national security state. Certainly, something out of the ordinary is underway, and yet its birth pangs, while widely reported, are generally categorized as aspects of an exceedingly familiar American system somewhat in disarray.\n\n1. 1% Elections\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCheck out the news about the 2016 presidential election and you\u2019ll quickly feel a sense of been-there, done-that. As a start, the two names most associated with it, Bush and Clinton, couldn\u2019t be more familiar, highlighting as they do the curiously dynastic quality of recent presidential contests. (If a Bush or Clinton should win in 2016 and again in 2020, a member of one of those families will have controlled the presidency for 28 of the last 36 years.)\n\nTake, for instance, \u201cWhy 2016 Is Likely to Become a Close Race,\u201d a recent piece Nate Cohn wrote for my hometown paper. A noted election statistician, Cohn points out that, despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s historically staggering lead in Democratic primary polls (and lack of serious challengers), she could lose the general election. He bases this on what we know about her polling popularity from the Monica Lewinsky moment of the 1990s to the present. Cohn assures readers that Hillary will not \u201cbe a Democratic Eisenhower, a popular, senior statesperson who cruises to an easy victory.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of comparison that offers a certain implicit reassurance about the near future. (No, Virginia, we haven\u2019t left the world of politics in which former general and president Dwight D. Eisenhower can still be a touchstone.)\n\nCohn may be right when it comes to Hillary\u2019s electability, but this is not Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s or even Al Gore\u2019s America. If you want a measure of that, consider this year\u2019s primaries. I mean, of course, the 2015 ones. Once upon a time, the campaign season started with candidates flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire early in the election year to establish their bona fides among party voters. These days, however, those are already late primaries.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe early primaries, the ones that count, take place among a small group of millionaires andbillionaires, a new caste flush with cash who will personally, or through complex networks of funders, pour multi-millions of dollars into the campaigns of candidates of their choice. So the early primaries -- this year mainly a Republican affair -- are taking place in resort spots like Las Vegas, Rancho Mirage, California, and Sea Island, Georgia, as has been widely reported. These \u201ccontests\u201d involve groveling politicians appearing at the beck and call of the rich and powerful, and so reflect our new 1% electoral system. (The main pro-Hillary super PAC, for instance, is aiming for a kitty of $500 million heading into 2016, while the Koch brothers network has already promised to drop almost $1 billion into the coming campaign season, doubling their efforts in the last presidential election year.)\n\nEver since the Supreme Court opened up the ultimate floodgates with its 2010 Citizens United decision, each subsequent election has seen record-breaking amounts of money donated and spent. The 2012 presidential campaign was the first $2 billion election; campaign 2016 is expected to hit the $5 billion mark without breaking a sweat. By comparison, according to Burton Abrams and Russell Settle in their study, \u201cThe Effect of Broadcasting on Political Campaign Spending,\u201d Republicans and Democrats spent just under $13 million combined in 1956 when Eisenhower won his second term.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s still true that the 2016 primaries will involve actual voters, as will the election that follows. The previous election season, the midterms of 2014, cost almost $4 billion, a record despite the number of small donors continuing to drop. It also represented the lowest midterm voter turnout since World War II. (See: demobilization of the public, below -- and add in the demobilization of the Democrats as a real party, the breaking of organized labor, the fragmenting of the Republican Party, and the return of voter suppression laws visibly meant to limit the franchise.) It hardly matters just what the flood of new money does in such elections, when you can feel the weight of inequality bearing down on the whole process in a way that is pushing us somewhere new.\n\n2. The Privatization of the State (or the U.S. as a Prospective Third-World Nation)\n\nIn the recent coverage of the Hillary Clinton email flap, you can find endless references to the Clintons of yore in wink-wink, you-know-how-they-are-style reporting; and yes, she did delete a lot of emails; and yes, it\u2019s an election year coming and, as everyone points out, the Republicans are going to do their best to keep the email issue alive until hell freezes over, etc., etc. Again, the coverage, while eyeball gluing, is in a you\u2019ve-seen-it-all-before, you\u2019ll-see-it-all-again-mode.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHowever, you haven\u2019t seen it all before. The most striking aspect of this little brouhaha lies in what\u2019s most obvious but least highlighted. An American secretary of state chose to set up her own private, safeguarded email system for doing government work; that is, she chose to privatize her communications. If this were Cairo, it might not warrant a second thought. But it didn\u2019t happen in some third-world state. It was the act of a key official of the planet\u2019s reigning (or thrashing) superpower, which -- even if it wasn\u2019t the first time such a thing had ever occurred -- should be taken as a tiny symptom of something that couldn\u2019t be larger or, in the long stretch of history, newer: the ongoing privatization of the American state, or at least the national security part of it.\n\nThough the marriage of the state and the corporation has a pre-history, the full-scale arrival of the warrior corporation only occurred after 9/11. Someday, that will undoubtedly be seen as a seminal moment in the formation of whatever may be coming in this country. Only 13 years later, there is no part of the war state that has not experienced major forms of privatization. The U.S. military could no longer go to war without its crony corporationsdoing KP and guard duty, delivering the mail, building the bases, and being involved in just about all of its activities, including training the militaries of foreign allies and even fighting. Such warrior corporations are now involved in every aspect of the national security state, including torture, drone strikes, and -- to the tune of hundreds of thousands of contract employees like Edward Snowden -- intelligence gathering and spying. You name it and, in these years, it\u2019s been at least partly privatized.\n\nAll you have to do is read reporter James Risen\u2019s recent book, Pay Any Price, on how the global war on terror was fought in Washington, and you know that privatization has brought something else with it: corruption, scams, and the gaming of the system for profits of a sort that might normally be associated with a typical third-world kleptocracy. And all of this, a new world being born, was reflected in a tiny way in Hillary Clinton\u2019s very personal decision about her emails.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThough it\u2019s a subject I know so much less about, this kind of privatization (and the corruption that goes with it) is undoubtedly underway in the non-war-making, non-security-projecting part of the American state as well.\n\n3. The De-legitimization of Congress and the Presidency\n\n\n\nOn a third front, American \u201cconfidence\u201d in the three classic check-and-balance branches of government, as measured by polling outfits, continues to fall. In 2014, Americans expressing a \u201cgreat deal of confidence\u201d in the Supreme Court hit a new low of 23%; in the presidency, it was 11%, and in Congress a bottom-scraping 5%. (The military, on the other hand, registers at 50%.) The figures for \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d are respectively 20%, 44%, and more than 50%. All are in or near record-breaking territory for the last four decades.\n\nIt seems fair to say that in recent years Congress has been engaged in a process of delegitimizing itself. Where that body once had the genuine power to declare war, for example, it is now \u201cdebating\u201d in a desultory fashion an \u201cauthorization\u201d for a war against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and possibly elsewhere that has already been underway for eight months and whose course, it seems, will be essentially unaltered, whether Congress authorizes it or not.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat would President Harry Truman, who once famously ran a presidential campaign against a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress, have to say about a body that truly can do just about nothing? Or rather, to give the Republican war hawks in that new Congress their due, not quite nothing. They are proving capable of acting effectively to delegitimize the presidency as well. House Majority Leader John Boehner\u2019s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to undercut the president's Iranian nuclear negotiations and the lettersigned by 47 Republican senators and directed to the Iranian ayatollahs are striking examples of this. They are visibly meant to tear down an \u201cimperial presidency\u201d that Republicans gloried in not so long ago.\n\nThe radical nature of that letter, not as an act of state but of its de-legitimization, was noted even in Iran, where fundamentalist Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei proclaimed it \u201ca sign of a decline in political ethics and the destruction of the American establishment from within.\u201d Here, however, the letter is either being covered as a singularly extreme one-off act (\u201ctreason!\u201d) or, as Jon Stewart did on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d as part of a repetitive tit-for-tat between Democrats and Republicans over who controls foreign policy. It is, in fact, neither. It represents part of a growing pattern in which Congress becomes an ever less effective body, except in its willingness to take on and potentially take out the presidency.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, all that \u201csmall government\u201d Republicans and \u201cbig government\u201d Democrats can agree on is offering essentially unconditional support to the military and the national security state. The Republican Party -- its various factions increasingly at each other\u2019s throats almost as often as at those of the Democrats -- seems reasonably united solely on issues of war-making and security. As for the Democrats, an unpopular administration, facing constant attack by those who loath President Obama, has kept its footing in part by allying with and fusing with the national security state. A president who came into office rejecting torture and promoting sunshine and transparency in government has, in the course of six-plus years, come to identify himself almost totally with the U.S. military, the CIA, the NSA, and the like. While it has launched an unprecedented campaign against whistleblowers and leakers (as well as sunshine and transparency), the Obama White House has proved a powerful enabler of, but also remarkably dependent upon, that state-within-a-state, a strange fate for \u201cthe imperial presidency.\u201d\n\n4. The Rise of the National Security State as the Fourth Branch of Government\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne \u201cbranch\u201d of government is, however, visibly on the rise and rapidly gaining independence from just about any kind of oversight. Its ability to enact its wishes with almost no opposition in Washington is a striking feature of our moment. But while the symptoms of this process are regularly reported, the overall phenomenon -- the creation of ade facto fourth branch of government -- gets remarkably little attention. In the war on terror era, the national security state has come into its own. Its growth has been phenomenal. Though it\u2019s seldom pointed out, it should be considered remarkable that in this period we gained a second full-scale \u201cdefense department,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security, and that it and the Pentagon have become even more entrenched, each surrounded by its own growing \u201ccomplex\u201d of private corporations, lobbyists, and allied politicians. The militarization of the country has, in these years, proceeded apace.\n\nMeanwhile, the duplication to be found in the U.S. Intelligence Community with its 17 major agencies and outfits is staggering. Its growing ability to surveil and spy on a global scale, including on its own citizens, puts the totalitarian states of the twentieth century to shame. That the various parts of the national security state can act in just about any fashion without fear of accountability in a court of law is by now too obvious to belabor. As wealth has traveled upwards in American society in ways not seen since the first Gilded Age, so taxpayer dollars have migrated into the national security state in an almost plutocratic fashion.\n\nNew reports regularly surface about the further activities of parts of that state. In recent weeks, for instance, we learned from Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley of the Intercept that the CIA has spent years trying to break the encryption on Apple iPhones and iPads; it has, that is, been aggressively seeking to attack an all-American corporation (even if significant parts of its production process are actually in China). Meanwhile, Devlin Barrett of the Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA, an agency barred from domestic spying operations of any sort, has been helping the U.S. Marshals Service (part of the Justice Department) create an airborne digital dragnet on American cell phones. Planes flying out of five U.S. cities carry a form of technology that \"mimics a cellphone tower.\" This technology, developed and tested in distant American war zones and now brought to \"the homeland,\" is just part of the ongoing militarization of the country from its borders to its police forces. And there\u2019s hardly been a week since Edward Snowden first released crucial NSA documents in June 2013 when such \u201cadvances\u201d haven\u2019t been in the news.\n\nNews also regularly bubbles up about the further expansion, reorganization, and upgrading of parts of the intelligence world, the sorts of reports that have become the barely noticed background hum of our lives. Recently, for instance, Director John Brennan announced a major reorganization of the CIA meant to break down the classic separation between spies and analysts at the Agency, while creating a new Directorate of Digital Innovation responsible for, among other things, cyberwarfare and cyberespionage. At about the same time, according to the New York Times, the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, an obscure State Department agency, was given a new and expansive role in coordinating \u201call the existing attempts at countermessaging [against online propaganda by terror outfits like the Islamic State] by much larger federal departments, including the Pentagon, Homeland Security and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThis sort of thing is par for the course in an era in which the national security state has only grown stronger, endlessly elaborating, duplicating, and overlapping the various parts of its increasingly labyrinthine structure. And keep in mind that, in a structure that has fought hardto keep what it's doing cloaked in secrecy, there is so much more that we don\u2019t know. Still, we should know enough to realize that this ongoing process reflects something new in our American world (even if no one cares to notice).\n\n5. The Demobilization of the American People\n\nIn The Age of Acquiescence, a new book about America\u2019s two Gilded Ages, Steve Fraser asks why it was that, in the nineteenth century, another period of plutocratic excesses, concentration of wealth and inequality, buying of politicians, and attempts to demobilize the public, Americans took to the streets with such determination and in remarkable numbers over long periods of time to protest their treatment, and stayed there even when the brute power of the state was called out against them. In our own moment, Fraser wonders, why has the silence of the public in the face of similar developments been so striking?\n\nAfter all, a grim new American system is arising before our eyes. Everything we once learned in the civics textbooks of our childhoods about how our government works now seems askew, while the growth of poverty, the flatlining of wages, the rise of the .01%, the collapse of labor, and the militarization of society are all evident.\n\nThe process of demobilizing the public certainly began with the military. It was initially a response to the disruptive and rebellious draftees of the Vietnam-era. In 1973, at the stroke of a presidential pen, the citizen\u2019s army was declared no more, the raising of new recruits was turned over to advertising agencies (a preview of the privatization of the state to come), and the public was sent home, never again to meddle in military affairs. Since 2001, that form of demobilization has been etched in stone and transformed into a way of life in the name of the \u201csafety\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d of the public.\n\nSince then, \u201cwe the people\u201d have made ourselves felt in only three disparate ways: from the left in the Occupy movement, which, with its slogans about the 1% and the 99%, put the issue of growing economic inequality on the map of American consciousness; from the right, in the Tea Party movement, a complex expression of discontent backed and at least partially funded by right-wing operatives and billionaires, and aimed at the de-legitimization of the \u201cnanny state\u201d; and the recent round of post-Ferguson protests spurred at least in part by the militarization of the police in black and brown communities around the country.\n\nThe Birth of a New System\n\nOtherwise, a moment of increasing extremity has also been a moment of -- to use Fraser\u2019s word -- \u201cacquiescence.\u201d Someday, we\u2019ll assumedly understand far better how this all came to be. In the meantime, let me be as clear as I can be about something that seems murky indeed: this period doesn\u2019t represent a version, no matter how perverse or extreme, of politics as usual; nor is the 2016 campaign an election as usual; nor are we experiencing Washington as usual. Put together our 1% elections, the privatization of our government, the de-legitimization of Congress and the presidency, as well as the empowerment of the national security state and the U.S. military, and add in the demobilization of the American public (in the name of protecting us from terrorism), and you have something like a new ballgame.\n\nWhile significant planning has been involved in all of this, there may be no ruling pattern or design. Much of it may be happening in a purely seat-of-the-pants fashion. In response, there has been no urge to officially declare that something new is afoot, let alone convene a new constitutional convention. Still, don\u2019t for a second think that the American political system isn\u2019t being rewritten on the run by interested parties in Congress, our present crop of billionaires, corporate interests, lobbyists, the Pentagon, and the officials of the national security state.\n\nOut of the chaos of this prolonged moment and inside the shell of the old system, a new culture, a new kind of politics, a new kind of governance is being born right before our eyes. Call it what you want. But call it something. Stop pretending it\u2019s not happening.",
