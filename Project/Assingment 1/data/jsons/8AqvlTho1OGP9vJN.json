    "content": "Outside First Universalist Church in Minneapolis , a Black Lives Matter poster hangs , wilted in the sun , above a crowd of Minnesotans waiting eagerly to enter . The group is an unusual mashup : mostly teenagers and those who would qualify for the senior special at IHOP , both cohorts outfitted in political pins , caps , and T-shirts . As I sit on the steps of the church , a man with salt-white hair hands me an informative flyer about the Green New Deal . It \u2019 s as if whatever activism bug bit the flower children has come out of hibernation to infect Gen Z .\nInside , an environmental justice event hosted by U.S. congresswoman Ilhan Omar is about to start . The venue is packed , and a local pop-punk band called Butter Boys has just finished its opening set . Juwaria Jama , a 15-year-old activist scheduled to speak alongside Omar , nervously walks over to the pew to chat with her friend , fellow teen activist Raina Meyer . After , a middle-aged white woman leans over to Meyer with a giddy , starstruck look on her face : \u201c Was that Ilhan Omar \u2019 s daughter ? \u201d\nShe \u2019 s referring to Jama , who is Black and wears the hijab . But Jama looks nothing like Isra Hirsi , Omar \u2019 s actual daughter .\nIsra , meanwhile , is standing in the back of the church , awaiting her cue to give the closing statement . When it \u2019 s time , she introduces herself as the co-executive director of a group called U.S . Youth Climate Strike , leaving out her relation to Omar . The climate crisis , she tells the crowd , \u201c is the fight of my generation , and it needs to be addressed urgently . \u201d\nOn stage , Isra reads off her candy-colored phone through tortoise shell glasses . Her wrist is wrapped in a green scrunchie that matches her striped green and blue tee . She speaks quickly but confidently , just as she does off-stage . She \u2019 s 16 ( though her bright eyes and soft complexion make her look arguably younger ) , but she doesn \u2019 t smile or stutter nervously through her words . She hasn \u2019 t been doing this long ; she \u2019 s a natural .\nIt was only this year , in January 2019 , that Isra founded the U.S . Youth Climate Strike\u2014the American arm of a global youth climate change movement\u2014alongside 12-year-old Denver activist Haven Coleman ( who has since stepped away , making Isra the sole executive director ) . In March , the organization \u2019 s largest strike inspired an estimated 1.6 million students across 120 countries to skip school in order to demand action on climate change from adults in power . Since then , she has organized locally and nationally for environmental justice with a focus on carving out space for young people of color within the movement . Most recently , she \u2019 s been rallying students to participate in the global climate strike on September 20 , during which she \u2019 ll be speaking at the Minneapolis march .\nSince January , Isra \u2019 s advocacy has awarded her both positive and negative recognition from inside her school \u2019 s hallways to the pages of Time magazine and Jacobin and the tweets of presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .\nBut Isra isn \u2019 t impressed by attention\u2014her family has had more than enough of it in the past couple of years .\nU.S . Youth Climate Strike launched the same month that Isra \u2019 s mother took office and quickly became the country \u2019 s most scrutinized congresswoman after achieving a series of historic firsts : becoming the first Somali-American legislator in the U.S. in 2017\u2014and then the first Muslim woman ( alongside Rashida Tlaib ) , first person to wear the hijab , and first Somali American in Congress in 2019 . Today , Omar is the most famous Muslim woman in America , the embodiment of representation realized .\nThis puts Isra in a tricky position : She \u2019 s both a symbol of supposed racial and religious equality in the U.S.\u2014the kind that makes white women grin proudly at Black Muslim girls that aren \u2019 t even her\u2014and a teenager trying to figure out who she is in the wake of her mother \u2019 s own colossal assertion of identity , all while staring down the serious task of literally saving the world . Faced with the pitfalls of imposed national visibility ( harassment , safety threats , tokenization , bullying ) , she \u2019 s challenged with figuring out how to channel that attention to the thing that actually sets her apart : her vision for environmental justice .\nA year ago , Isra didn \u2019 t have a sense of climate urgency , though she \u2019 s been active in local social justice movements ever since she attended her first protest at six years old . Later , in middle school , she was mainly focused on the Black Lives Matter movement . At age 12 , alongside her family and thousands of organizers , she helped shut down the Mall of America to demand justice for Jamar Clark , a 24-year-old Black man who was killed in 2015 by two Minneapolis police officers who were never charged with his murder . Entering high school , the fight to end gun violence had Isra \u2019 s attention , particularly in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting .\nAt the time , climate activism didn \u2019 t feel that important to her , relative to other issues\u2014partially because it was never framed that way . \u201c Gun control and climate change are [ considered ] white issues , \u201d she said when I met with her in Minneapolis , \u201c Black lives , police brutality , whatever , are not . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t until she joined a high school environmental club during her freshman year that she learned how , at its core , climate change affects communities of color the most . Black people , for example , are almost twice as likely as other residents to die during a heatwave in Los Angeles due to segregation and a lower likelihood of having access to air conditioners . And a 2018 report by the EPA found that people of color are much more likely to live in communities affected by environmental pollutants , as well as more likely to develop health complications as a result .\nIsra earnestly described her arrival to climate consciousness as \u201c really , really late in the game. \u201d She was 15 .\n\u201c [ They \u2019 re ] talking about how much they love grass and their lakes\u2014I ca n't connect with you on that . \u201d\nShe quickly made up for lost time , determined to build an environmental justice movement in which young people of color could see themselves . Raised in the city for most of her life , Isra doesn \u2019 t care all that much for nature . She \u2019 s not into hiking , though she did go camping once ( mainly because it was a free trip ) . Her advocacy has nothing to do with a deep love for the outdoors and everything to do with the communities disproportionately hurt by climate change\u2014not because their favorite rafting river is drying up , but because their drinking water is poisoned and the air they breathe is killing them . To her , this is the only climate advocacy that makes sense .\n\u201c [ They \u2019 re ] talking about how much they love grass and their lakes\u2014I ca n't connect with you on that , \u201d she said of white-led environmental groups . \u201c So it 's a subtle We do n't want you here because they talk about things , knowing people like me ca n't relate . \u201d\nHer values are clear in the scope of her initiatives . This spring , with her sights set on 2020 , she worked toward putting climate change on the agendas of presidential candidates\u2014despite the fact that she still won \u2019 t be old enough to vote on Election Day . Meanwhile , she urged her school district to grant Eid al-Fitr as an official holiday ( although she said she met with the superintendent multiple times , it has yet to happen ) . And on social media , as she recounted her efforts , she began amassing a following by making intersectional activism seem accessible .\nAt home , things were changing fast , too . Her mom \u2019 s new job meant she was now away in D.C. the majority of the time , though the effects of her new position in Congress were very much felt by Isra , her younger brother and sister , and their father in Minnesota . After only a few months in office , the Omar-Hirsi family had to relocate to a safer , more discreet , and , to Isra \u2019 s dismay , whiter neighborhood , due to safety threats against Omar and her family .\nIt \u2019 s 4 p.m. on a hot Ramadan day and Isra is dragging her feet across a bright green lawn in Minneapolis \u2019 s Gold Medal Park . By the time she gets to me , her shoulders are slouched over in fatigue beneath her tight curls , which are pulled half-up in two small , baby blue ties . She doesn \u2019 t seem particularly excited to be spending her evening with a journalist ; after all , people like me have been blowing up her phone for months . Turns out she \u2019 s also had a rough day .\n\u201c We did a seminar during seventh period about hate speech , \u201d she said , shaking her head . \u201c It just went horrible . \u201d\nIsra was leading the seminar with a few other classmates when students in the audience began sending in live , anonymous questions through an online forum that quickly turned cruel , as things often do when teenagers meet digital anonymity . \u201c We have free speech , why can \u2019 t white people say the N word ? \u201d asked one student . Then , they began specifically targeting Isra and another girl on stage . \u201c Isra is so white-washed , \u201d someone in the crowd wrote . \u201c This girl needs to get off the stage , she 's so annoying , \u201d wrote another .\n\u201c She has poise and wisdom that is beyond her years . ''\nTo the average 16-year-old , the experience might have been devastating , and Isra admits that the comments from her classmates\u2014who she described as usually pretty \u201c woke \u201d \u2014caught her off-guard . But after recounting the story , she quickly shrugs it off . For better or worse , she is accustomed to public harassment .\nPlus , Isra is remarkably self-assured and logic-driven for a teen , something her mother has noticed too . \u201c I \u2019 m constantly inspired by her drive and tenacity\u2014and how she unapologetically shows up in the world , \u201d said Omar in a statement about Isra . \u201c She has poise and wisdom that is beyond her years , and it makes me feel blessed every single day that she was gifted to me as my first-born . \u201d\nSince joining Congress , Omar has been the target of relentless defamation campaigns , which rely on anti-Black Islamophobia , and often come for Isra , too , flooding her DMs despite the fact that she \u2019 s a minor . When she checks her phone between classes , in addition to national organizers blowing up her notifications , she expects to find messages from strangers telling her to \u201c go back \u201d to a country in which she \u2019 s never lived .\nThings got really bad in April , when Donald Trump tweeted a strangely edited video of Omar \u2019 s face layered over the Twin Towers during the 9/11 attacks , causing a surge of death threats , which she was already receiving . Several politicians denounced the president \u2019 s actions , and Omar \u2019 s supporters began tweeting # IStandWithIlhan .\nAt the time , Isra was immersed in U.S . Youth Climate Strike \u2019 s mission to get every presidential candidate to agree to attend a climate debate . While the country rallied either for or against her mother , instead of keeping a low profile , Isra chased down presidential candidates to confront them in person about whether or not they \u2019 d sign on to a live discussion on the climate crisis .\n\u201c I feel like it 's a weird thing to say\u2026 [ but ] it does n't really impact me , \u201d Isra said of the way her mother has been targeted . She pauses between words , apparently wary of coming off as cold . After Trump \u2019 s video , she recalls taking a moment ; she didn \u2019 t think attacks against her mother would get this bad . \u201c But then I was just like , It 's whatever . She said she was fine . I can move on . ''\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t want to be known as Ilhan Omar \u2019 s daughter , I wanted to be known as myself . \u201d\nThe word that Isra uses over and over again to describe this time in her life is \u201c weird. \u201d It was weird when people at school approached her to see how she was coping ; it was weird when her principal told her to tell her mother that the school stands with her ; \u201c It \u2019 s kind of weird when you 're getting text messages like , \u2018 Are you okay , is your family safe ? \u2019 and , in reality , I 'm completely fine , \u201d she said .\nIsra has been the subject of heightened attention and teasing since age 13 , when her mother became a state representative . Much of it is harmless , if annoying , like when her social studies teacher starts class by saying , \u201c Isra , you \u2019 ll know what happened in Congress this morning . \u201d\nOther comments are less innocent . \u201c The criticism I receive [ about ] my mother was never really in my face until today , \u201d she said , referring to the hate speech seminar earlier where one student went so far as to call Isra an \u201c incest baby \u201d based on an inaccurate and Islamophobic rumor about her mother \u2019 s marriage history .\nBut this spring , the taunts Isra faced began to change their tune . As the world anticipated and then watched the magnitude of the youth climate marches around the globe , their eyes turned to the teens who made it happen , like Greta Thunberg and Isra . And as she became more and more well-known , the teasing shifted to being about her ( or the \u201c PC police \u201d as some students call her ) and her accomplishments\u2014rather than her mother \u2019 s . Ironically , though , that shift is what she \u2019 d long been wanting : to be seen for who she is\u2014not who she comes from\u2014and most of all , for what she has achieved .\nIn Mid-August , Isra published a post on Medium grappling with the resentment she \u2019 s built up around her mother \u2019 s fame . \u201c For months , I was frustrated with her presence in my work because I felt like it caused me more harm than good , \u201d it reads . \u201c I didn \u2019 t want to be known as Ilhan Omar \u2019 s daughter , I wanted to be known as myself . \u201d\nBut it isn \u2019 t only Omar who \u2019 s had a presence in Isra \u2019 s work ; Isra has been influencing her mother \u2019 s work too . \u201c The urgency in which she expresses concern for the state of the world is what fuels me to do the work that I do , whether it is climate change or gun violence prevention , \u201d Omar said .\nEventually , who she was and how people saw her began to overlap , and her reach and influence grew of its own accord . Even back in April , days after Trump \u2019 s video tweet , Barack Obama tweeted at Isra recognizing her work as a climate advocate . He did not mention Ilhan Omar .\nNo earlier than 8:51 p.m. , the sun finally shows itself out for the day . We \u2019 re breaking our fast at an Italian restaurant of Isra \u2019 s choice across the street from her favorite Target in downtown Minneapolis . The restaurant is fancier than it looked online , and Isra laughs at her last-minute decision to change into white Crocs .\nAt the table , I tell her about the woman at the church who confused her with Jama . She laughs . \u201c We look nothing alike ! \u201d she says in between bites of mashed potatoes and pasta , two of the few foods she actually eats . ( She is a self-described picky eater , and told me , among other things , that she finds ketchup spicy . )\nThis particular brand of white person\u2014the type that worships Omar and , in the same breath , perpetuates the very biases she \u2019 s fighting against\u2014is very familiar to Isra . \u201c I live in a district where everybody is obsessed with my mother , \u201d she said . ( She \u2019 s right ; Omar won 78 percent of the vote in her district . ) But , time and time again , it was this type of clueless white person that Isra encountered in the homogenous environmental clubs and organizations she joined before leaving to co-found U.S . Youth Climate Strike .\n\u201c My identity has kind of forced me into this box . You 're that one intersectional person and it 's like , Oh look at Isra , this Black , Muslim , climate activist talking about Black people , just because I happen to exude those identities when you look at me . \u201d\n\u201c They would invite us to events just so we could be the tokens , \u201d she said , explaining how she and other people of color were treated in these supposedly progressive activist spaces . \u201c They would compliment us on our speaking , just so that we would want to do it again . \u201d\nIsra is used to being paraded because of her identity . It seems that because of that experience , she \u2019 s developed a clear sense of how she \u2019 s perceived and the labels that both propel her forward and hold her back , often at the same time . \u201c I do n't get to walk into a room and call myself a climate activist without being a Black activist , a Muslim activist , a feminist , \u201d she said , her tone indifferent and matter-of-fact . \u201c My identity has kind of forced me into this box . You 're that one intersectional person and it 's like , Oh look at Isra , this Black , Muslim , climate activist talking about Black people , just because I happen to exude those identities when you look at me . \u201d\nOn top of that , she \u2019 s been hyper-aware of being seen only through the context of her mother . \u201c I have to prove to the world that I 'm not doing what I 'm doing because of her , \u201d she said . That can be frustrating , given that Omar is hardly involved in Isra \u2019 s organizing . \u201c A simple retweet that I do n't ask for , but that 's all . I started doing these things without even telling her , \u201d she said . Proving to others that her advocacy work was of her own prerogative became a task in itself .\n\u201c I live 2 lives- that of a climate justice organizer and that of a politician \u2019 s daughter , \u201d Isra wrote in her August Medium post .\nPerhaps this double life is part of why Isra seems adamant about not preoccupying herself with the promise of representation . She understands that her mother can exist as a Congresswoman who will be written into American history books , and at the same time , that her visibility alone could never be enough to cure a country whose inner workings are inherently racist . Plus , in her own experiences , the line between representation and tokenization has been worn so thin that it \u2019 s hard to know if it exists at all .\nDespite the eyes on her back and people \u2019 s preoccupation with how to label her , Isra has been laser-focused on pragmatic organizing efforts that have paid off . At the end of April , she got presidential candidates Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang to agree to a climate debate by confronting them face-to-face , but the Democratic National Committee disappointingly refused to host the debate for which she and her co-organizers at U.S . Youth Climate Strike had been pushing . In September , however , the efforts of their grassroots work were realized when a debate on climate change featuring Democratic presidential candidates aired on CNN .\nIn yet another performance of premature wisdom , Isra ends her Medium essay with a realization : that her proximity to the most polarizing woman in Congress is , in fact , a privilege that she \u2019 s taken for granted . \u201c I want to find ways to recognize this new privilege as a net positive in the spaces that I exist in , \u201d she wrote , \u201c while at the same time learning when it \u2019 s my time to step back and pass on the mic . \u201d\nThis summer , Isra got to reap the benefits of that privilege , spending two weeks in Congress with her mom . When we \u2019 d spoken at the beginning of summer , she told me she was interested in going into politics one day\u2014maybe even running for president\u2014potentially after law school . Today , that aspiration has been tempered . If she absolutely had to go into politics , she said , she \u2019 d definitely stop at the local level . Her impression of Congress ?",

For better or worse, she is accustomed to public harassment.\n\nPlus, Isra is remarkably self-assured and logic-driven for a teen, something her mother has noticed too. \u201cI\u2019m constantly inspired by her drive and tenacity\u2014and how she unapologetically shows up in the world,\u201d said Omar in a statement about Isra. \u201cShe has poise and wisdom that is beyond her years, and it makes me feel blessed every single day that she was gifted to me as my first-born.\u201d\n\nSince joining Congress, Omar has been the target of relentless defamation campaigns, which rely on anti-Black Islamophobia, and often come for Isra, too, flooding her DMs despite the fact that she\u2019s a minor. When she checks her phone between classes, in addition to national organizers blowing up her notifications, she expects to find messages from strangers telling her to \u201cgo back\u201d to a country in which she\u2019s never lived.\n\nThings got really bad in April, when Donald Trump tweeted a strangely edited video of Omar\u2019s face layered over the Twin Towers during the 9/11 attacks, causing a surge of death threats, which she was already receiving. Several politicians denounced the president\u2019s actions, and Omar\u2019s supporters began tweeting #IStandWithIlhan.\n\nAt the time, Isra was immersed in U.S. Youth Climate Strike\u2019s mission to get every presidential candidate to agree to attend a climate debate. While the country rallied either for or against her mother, instead of keeping a low profile, Isra chased down presidential candidates to confront them in person about whether or not they\u2019d sign on to a live discussion on the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cI feel like it's a weird thing to say\u2026 [but] it doesn't really impact me,\u201d Isra said of the way her mother has been targeted. She pauses between words, apparently wary of coming off as cold. After Trump\u2019s video, she recalls taking a moment; she didn\u2019t think attacks against her mother would get this bad. \u201cBut then I was just like, It's whatever. She said she was fine. I can move on.\"\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be known as Ilhan Omar\u2019s daughter, I wanted to be known as myself.\u201d\n\nThe word that Isra uses over and over again to describe this time in her life is \u201cweird.\u201d It was weird when people at school approached her to see how she was coping; it was weird when her principal told her to tell her mother that the school stands with her; \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird when you're getting text messages like, \u2018Are you okay, is your family safe?\u2019 and, in reality, I'm completely fine,\u201d she said.\n\nIsra has been the subject of heightened attention and teasing since age 13, when her mother became a state representative. Much of it is harmless, if annoying, like when her social studies teacher starts class by saying, \u201cIsra, you\u2019ll know what happened in Congress this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like no\u2026 I don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nOther comments are less innocent. \u201cThe criticism I receive [about] my mother was never really in my face until today,\u201d she said, referring to the hate speech seminar earlier where one student went so far as to call Isra an \u201cincest baby\u201d based on an inaccurate and Islamophobic rumor about her mother\u2019s marriage history.\n\nBut this spring, the taunts Isra faced began to change their tune. As the world anticipated and then watched the magnitude of the youth climate marches around the globe, their eyes turned to the teens who made it happen, like Greta Thunberg and Isra. And as she became more and more well-known, the teasing shifted to being about her (or the \u201cPC police\u201d as some students call her) and her accomplishments\u2014rather than her mother\u2019s. Ironically, though, that shift is what she\u2019d long been wanting: to be seen for who she is\u2014not who she comes from\u2014and most of all, for what she has achieved.\n\nIn Mid-August, Isra published a post on Medium grappling with the resentment she\u2019s built up around her mother\u2019s fame. \u201cFor months, I was frustrated with her presence in my work because I felt like it caused me more harm than good,\u201d it reads. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be known as Ilhan Omar\u2019s daughter, I wanted to be known as myself.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t only Omar who\u2019s had a presence in Isra\u2019s work; Isra has been influencing her mother\u2019s work too. \u201cThe urgency in which she expresses concern for the state of the world is what fuels me to do the work that I do, whether it is climate change or gun violence prevention,\u201d Omar said.\n\nEventually, who she was and how people saw her began to overlap, and her reach and influence grew of its own accord. Even back in April, days after Trump\u2019s video tweet, Barack Obama tweeted at Isra recognizing her work as a climate advocate. He did not mention Ilhan Omar.\n\nNo earlier than 8:51 p.m., the sun finally shows itself out for the day. We\u2019re breaking our fast at an Italian restaurant of Isra\u2019s choice across the street from her favorite Target in downtown Minneapolis. The restaurant is fancier than it looked online, and Isra laughs at her last-minute decision to change into white Crocs.\n\nAt the table, I tell her about the woman at the church who confused her with Jama. She laughs. \u201cWe look nothing alike!\u201d she says in between bites of mashed potatoes and pasta, two of the few foods she actually eats. (She is a self-described picky eater, and told me, among other things, that she finds ketchup spicy.)\n\nThis particular brand of white person\u2014the type that worships Omar and, in the same breath, perpetuates the very biases she\u2019s fighting against\u2014is very familiar to Isra. \u201cI live in a district where everybody is obsessed with my mother,\u201d she said. (She\u2019s right; Omar won 78 percent of the vote in her district.) But, time and time again, it was this type of clueless white person that Isra encountered in the homogenous environmental clubs and organizations she joined before leaving to co-found U.S. Youth Climate Strike.\n\n\u201cMy identity has kind of forced me into this box. You're that one intersectional person and it's like, Oh look at Isra, this Black, Muslim, climate activist talking about Black people, just because I happen to exude those identities when you look at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would invite us to events just so we could be the tokens,\u201d she said, explaining how she and other people of color were treated in these supposedly progressive activist spaces. \u201cThey would compliment us on our speaking, just so that we would want to do it again.\u201d\n\nIsra is used to being paraded because of her identity. It seems that because of that experience, she\u2019s developed a clear sense of how she\u2019s perceived and the labels that both propel her forward and hold her back, often at the same time. \u201cI don't get to walk into a room and call myself a climate activist without being a Black activist, a Muslim activist, a feminist,\u201d she said, her tone indifferent and matter-of-fact. \u201cMy identity has kind of forced me into this box. You're that one intersectional person and it's like, Oh look at Isra, this Black, Muslim, climate activist talking about Black people, just because I happen to exude those identities when you look at me.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, she\u2019s been hyper-aware of being seen only through the context of her mother. \u201cI have to prove to the world that I'm not doing what I'm doing because of her,\u201d she said. That can be frustrating, given that Omar is hardly involved in Isra\u2019s organizing. \u201cA simple retweet that I don't ask for, but that's all. I started doing these things without even telling her,\u201d she said. Proving to others that her advocacy work was of her own prerogative became a task in itself.\n\n\u201cI live 2 lives- that of a climate justice organizer and that of a politician\u2019s daughter,\u201d Isra wrote in her August Medium post.\n\nPerhaps this double life is part of why Isra seems adamant about not preoccupying herself with the promise of representation. She understands that her mother can exist as a Congresswoman who will be written into American history books, and at the same time, that her visibility alone could never be enough to cure a country whose inner workings are inherently racist. Plus, in her own experiences, the line between representation and tokenization has been worn so thin that it\u2019s hard to know if it exists at all.\n\nDespite the eyes on her back and people\u2019s preoccupation with how to label her, Isra has been laser-focused on pragmatic organizing efforts that have paid off. At the end of April, she got presidential candidates Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang to agree to a climate debate by confronting them face-to-face, but the Democratic National Committee disappointingly refused to host the debate for which she and her co-organizers at U.S. Youth Climate Strike had been pushing. In September, however, the efforts of their grassroots work were realized when a debate on climate change featuring Democratic presidential candidates aired on CNN.\n\nIn yet another performance of premature wisdom, Isra ends her Medium essay with a realization: that her proximity to the most polarizing woman in Congress is, in fact, a privilege that she\u2019s taken for granted. \u201cI want to find ways to recognize this new privilege as a net positive in the spaces that I exist in,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwhile at the same time learning when it\u2019s my time to step back and pass on the mic.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Isra got to reap the benefits of that privilege, spending two weeks in Congress with her mom. When we\u2019d spoken at the beginning of summer, she told me she was interested in going into politics one day\u2014maybe even running for president\u2014potentially after law school. Today, that aspiration has been tempered. If she absolutely had to go into politics, she said, she\u2019d definitely stop at the local level. Her impression of Congress?\n\n\u201cReally, really childish.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.",
