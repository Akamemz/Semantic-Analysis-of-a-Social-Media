    "content": "The New York Times has created a spectacle around one of the stodgiest features of presidential primary season : the newspaper endorsement .

While nearly everyone else in the world of Democratic politics seems to have made up their mind , the board needs more time to choose between a more radical approach to fixing America \u2019 s many ills ( represented by Warren ) and a more conventional one ( Klobuchar ) . The Times editorial page has taken its reputation for careful , sober decision-making to the point of paralysis\u2014calling into question all the ostensible reasons for opening up the endorsement process in the first place .\nIn announcing the change earlier this month , Kathleen Kingsbury , the deputy editor of the editorial page , said the board aimed to make it \u201c our most transparent endorsement process to date. \u201d Transparency has become something of a theme for the Times , with Executive Editor Dean Baquet telling Meet the Press last year that it was crucial for shoring up the institution \u2019 s credibility in an era of fake news . \u201c We went through generations of just assuming everybody believed us , \u201d he said . \u201c What I think we \u2019 re going to have to get very aggressive at is to be really transparent , to assume nothing , and to make sure people know where we are , how we do our work , to show our work more aggressively . \u201d",
