''\nRepublican lawmakers also seized on the acknowledgment , after having complained about the suspected harassment more than a year ago . Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called for a `` government-wide review '' to assure `` these thuggish practices '' are not in use elsewhere . House Republican Leader Eric Cantor later said the House would investigate .\nReaction was swift and harsh after Lois Lerner , who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups , acknowledged the issue at a conference Friday sponsored by the American Bar Association .\nShe confirmed that organizations were singled out because they included the words `` tea party '' or `` patriot '' in their applications for tax-exempt status .\nMore On This ... Numerous Tea Party chapters claim IRS attempts to sabotage nonprofit status\nIn some cases , groups were asked for their list of donors , she said .\n`` That was wrong . That was absolutely incorrect , it was insensitive and it was inappropriate , '' Lerner said . `` The IRS would like to apologize for that . ''\nLerner said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias . After her talk , she told The Associated Press that no high-level IRS officials knew about the practice . She did not say when they found out .\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said the agency 's inspector general was investigating , calling the agents ' actions `` inappropriate '' and saying `` there needs to be action taken '' if wrongdoing is found .\nAs conservatives condemned the IRS for the additional scrutiny , IRS officials after the conference tried to offer a fuller explanation of what happened .\nThe IRS put out a written statement saying protocol was changed at the Cincinnati office in response to the rising number of applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups .

Unlike other charitable groups , these organizations are allowed to participate in political activities but their primary activity must be social welfare .\nThe agents tried to `` centralize work '' in response to the applications , the IRS said , leading to problems the agency claims have since been fixed .\n`` Mistakes were made initially , but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale . We fixed the situation last year and have made significant progress in moving the centralized cases through our system , '' the IRS said .\nOn a hastily arranged conference call Friday , Lerner said that the staffers who flagged those groups did so as `` short-hand '' to deal with the `` great number '' of cases in the system .\nShe acknowledged that some of the letters sent were `` far too broad '' and that asking for donors is `` generally not what we do . ''\n`` We made some mistakes , some people did n't use good judgment , '' she said , while claiming the reviews were not partisan .\nDuring the conference earlier Friday , Lerner said the number of groups filing for the tax-exempt status more than doubled from 2010 to 2012 , to more than 3,400 . To handle the influx , the IRS centralized its review of these applications in the office in Cincinnati . As part of the review , staffers look for signs that groups are participating in political activity . If so , IRS agents take a closer look to make sure that politics is n't the group 's primary activity , Lerner said .\nIn all , about 300 groups were singled out for additional review , Lerner said . Of those , about a quarter were singled out because they had `` tea party '' or `` patriot '' somewhere in their applications . Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked , though some withdrew their applications .\nMany conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS . They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy , intrusive questionnaires .\nThe forms , which the groups made available at the time , sought information about group members ' political activities , including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members .\nGroups shared some of those forms with FoxNews.com back in February 2012 , when the complaints first surfaced . In letters sent from IRS offices in Cincinnati , chapters including the Waco ( Texas ) Tea Party and the Ohio Liberty Council were asked to provide a list of donors , identify volunteers , financial support for and relationships with political candidates and parties , and even printed copies of their Facebook pages .\n`` Some of what they ( the IRS ) asked was reasonable , but there were some requests on there that were strange , '' Toby Marie Walker , president of the Waco Tea Party , told FoxNews.com last year .\nA dozen Republican senators wrote to the IRS in March 2012 expressing concerns about various accounts that the IRS inquiries were `` perceived to be excessive .
