    "content": "We might as well pack it in , guys . A new Bloomberg poll says Obama 's up by thirteen points :\nObama leads Romney 53 percent to 40 percent among likely voters , even as the public gives him low marks on handling the economy and the deficit , and six in 10 say the nation is headed down the wrong track , according to the poll conducted June 15- 18 . The survey shows Romney , a former Massachusetts governor , has yet to repair the damage done to his image during the Republican primary . Thirty-nine percent of Americans view him favorably , about the same as when he announced his presidential candidacy last June , while 48 percent see him unfavorably -- a 17-percentage point jump during a nomination fight dominated by attacks ads . A majority of likely voters , 55 percent , view him as more out of touch with average Americans compared with 36 percent who say the president is more out of touch .\nSo Americans apparently believe that President `` Doing Fine '' is 20 percentage points less `` out of touch '' with average Americans than his opponent . Fascinating . I 'm sure he 'll ponder that statistic as he enters the back nine on his 101st presidential golf outing . The survey sample is skewed , obviously , but let 's address this survey from another perspective . Ask yourself the following questions :\n( 1 ) Do you believe Obama fever is twice as hot as it was in 2008 ( when Obama won by roughly 6.5 points ) ? This poll says it is . ( 2 ) How has Barack Obama netted 13 points since Bloomberg 's March poll , which had the race tied at 47 ? ( 3 ) Does Bloomberg have a better grasp on this race than Rasmussen and Gallup , both of which show Romney ahead today by identical 47-45 margins ? ( 4 ) Does Barack Obama have a commanding lead nationally , despite being tied or down in new polls out of Michigan and Iowa -- both states that he won by double digits last time ? ( 5 ) If Barack Obama is cruising to a decisive victory , why is an expanding pool of elected Democrats choosing to jump ship from September 's Democratic National Convention , where Obama will be re-nominated ? ( 6 ) How massive would Obama 's lead be if he had n't just suffered a solid month of failed attacks , exploded narratives , party defections , botched events , inadvertent tells , and dreadful economic news ? 30 points ? 50 ?\nParting thought : With economic numbers being revised downward today , might the US cross back into negative job growth this month ? It 's ugly out there . Thank goodness the private sector is doing fine , and the president has so much breathing room in the polls . Thanks , Bloomberg .",
