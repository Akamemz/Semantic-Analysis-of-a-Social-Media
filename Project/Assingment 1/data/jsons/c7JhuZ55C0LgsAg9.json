The two nations have made peace and become close allies since the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 75 years ago and the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima four years later .\nBut the two leaders ' message is clear . What the Obama-Abe visit will demonstrate is that reconciliation is not a one-and-done , but is a perpetual work in progress between onetime adversaries \u2013 even after decades of close relations . Coming seven months after Mr. Obama \u2019 s groundbreaking visit to Hiroshima , Mr. Abe \u2019 s Pearl Harbor trip is yet another step beyond a declaration made decades ago .\n\u201c To some extent , these two events \u2026 are the last remaining hurdles in the process of reconciliation , \u201d says James Schoff , a senior fellow and expert in US-Japan relations at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . \u201c This is taking us a greater distance down this road \u2013 and it \u2019 s a long road . \u201d\nDemonstrating the power of reconciliation can be an important example for other relationships , some diplomatic experts say . The progress of the US-Japan relationship shows it can only happen after leaders and the people behind them grasp how reconciliation is not simply a nicety but crucially in their self-interest , some experts say .\nThat motivation may help explain Abe \u2019 s initiative to visit Pearl Harbor , where a surprise Japanese attack killed more than 2,400 American service members and civilians .
