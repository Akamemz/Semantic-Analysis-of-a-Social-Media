See the recent reports about a rise of coronavirus in rural America .\nCNN 's Jeff Zeleny is the rare person who has traveled lately . Here 's what he had to say about the protest :\nZW : First and most important , the thing that struck me most in your story was this apparent backlash to social distance in the form of a protest that could literally be heard from the governor 's office . Did that feel different to you than a normal partisan disagreement ? Was it more grassroots or groundswell ?\nJZ : The protest was large , but the thing that struck me the most is that it went on and on , with honking horns , blaring music and raucous jeers for more than five hours . It was protest-by-parade \u2014 definitely not organic , considering it was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition , but the anger was absolutely real . It had the feel of a Trump rally from 2016 and a Tea Party rally from 2010 \u2014 back at a time when rallies were the norm .\nWhat was striking was dozens upon dozens of people who stood on steps of the Capitol and the surrounding sidewalk , defying not only the strict stay-at-home orders , but also blatantly ignoring basic medical common sense .\nThere 's no question the economic pain is real in Michigan , with about one-quarter of the state 's eligible workforce seeking some type of unemployment help . But the Village People 's `` YMCA , '' which blasted from a Trump trailer that 's often seen at the President 's campaign rallies , seemed oddly discordant on a day that the state 's death toll hovered around 2,000 people .\nZW : Second , you 're the first person I 've talked to recently that has been away from their house . What was it like in an airport ? In a hotel ? Or did you avoid both ?\nJZ : I flew from Reagan National in Washington to the Detroit Metro Airport , both of which were virtually empty . The biggest inconvenience : No coffee for my 6 a.m. flight on Wednesday , since all restaurants were closed . And only bottled water , with a side of Biscotti and Purell wipes served in a plastic bag , on the plane . But I 'm certainly not complaining , given the janitorial staff and airline workers still on duty as before .\nI travel often \u2014 or I did before the pandemic \u2014 but I do n't believe I 've ever stayed in an entirely empty hotel . The front desk manager told me only one other room was occupied , which was for my colleague Jake Carpenter , a CNN photojournalist . I limited my trip to one night and ordered pizza and salad from a nearby restaurant in East Lansing .\nZW : Third , how do you interview people in person and social distance ?\nJZ : I mainly just observed people at the rally , having conversations with only a couple people from a respectable distance . Their hand-made signs made their opinions easily known .\nI traveled to Lansing to interview the governor , which we did from six feet away in two chairs , with two cameras . I spent time in her office , where I also stayed at a safe distance .\nAnd this is what the Detroit airport looks like as I fly back to Washington . The only person you can see in this picture is President Trump on the television .\nIt sounds like science fiction . But this is real . CNN 's Ray Sanchez tried to envision what life will be like in the near term . What was most striking was his description of how contact tracing -- tracking whether you 've come into contact with the disease -- could work in practice .\nForget about privacy . The tracing of people with regard to coronavirus is underway in China and some other places . In China , the use of a color-coded badge on your phone dictates where you can go .
