Trump \u2019 s dad also treated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi as a non-event and made bargaining chips of the Hong Kong protesters .\nBarack Obama and Don Jr get it right when they ding the left \u2019 s social justice warriors for their paroxysms of wokeness .

Also , What \u2019 s better than capitalism and trolling combined ? ? ? Answer : NOTHING ! \u201d\nIt appears Don Jr has taken a page from the playbook of Yair Netanyahu , the son of Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel \u2019 s beleaguered prime minister and Trump Sr \u2019 s one-time political soulmate . For years , the younger Netanyahu has served as the keeper of his father \u2019 s ideological flame and troller-in-chief of his adversaries .\nUnlike Yair , Don Jr \u2019 s proximity to his father represents an evolution of sorts , one that Triggered only hints at . Don Jr acknowledges that he was shipped off to the Hill School amid his parents \u2019 acrimonious and tabloid-headlining divorce . He also touches on his discomfort with his father \u2019 s lifestyle .\n\u201c There was something , \u201d he writes , \u201c that made me feel uncomfortable around the people who populated the rich circles my father lived and worked in . Even when my father would bring home a celebrity \u2026 I would run in the other direction . \u201d\nLeft unsaid is that as a 12-year-old , Don Jr did not talk to his father for a year while his father \u2019 s marriage to Ivana , his mother , crumbled before the cameras .\nUnsurprisingly , Don Jr goes full bore at the Clintons and the Bidens , labelling the former family \u201c one of the most corrupt and uncivil political machines in the history of our nation \u201d . Unfortunately , the Trumps appear to have an edge over the Clintons when it comes to grifting : at least the Clinton Foundation was real . The Trump Foundation and Trump University ? Not so much .\nTrump says he wants to read Ukraine call transcript in TV 'fireside chat ' Read more\nIndeed , as the president framed things the other day as he backtracked over holding the G7 confab at the Doral : \u201c You people with this phony Emoluments Clause . \u201d\nSaid differently , Bill Clinton was impeached because of his zipper . The incumbent president is in hot water for making the US government a Kleenex for his raging grudges and ambitions .\nAs for the Bidens , Don Jr had this to say on Fox News : \u201c I wish my name was Hunter Biden . I could go abroad , make millions off of my father \u2019 s presidency \u2013 I \u2019 d be a really rich guy ! It would be incredible ! \u201d\nStill , Triggered \u2019 s critique of the left \u2019 s use of shaming as a cudgel should not be ignored . The fact is , members of the Democratic establishment continue to worship at the twin altars of identity politics and political correctness .\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed , Richard Stengel , an undersecretary in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s state department , argued that the constitution should not protect hate speech , which should be banned \u201c because the intellectual underpinning of the first amendment was engineered for a simpler era \u201d .

His convention speech warranted the attention it received .\nDon Jr offers a less impulsive and younger version of the incumbent . He \u2019 s a bona fide hunter and outdoorsman . For him , guns aren \u2019 t a prop . In a rifle-centric party , that counts for plenty . Unlike Jared Kushner , there \u2019 s a there there and he \u2019 s a lot more fun than Mike Pence .\nThe GOP has been recast in the president \u2019 s image .
