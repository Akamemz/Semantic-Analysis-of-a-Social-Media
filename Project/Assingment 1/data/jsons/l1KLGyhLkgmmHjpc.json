These results demonstrate that there is n't much risk of airplane terrorism , and we should ratchet security down to pre-9/11 levels .\nWe do n't need perfect airport security . We just need security that 's good enough to dissuade someone from building a plot around evading it . If you 're caught with a gun or a bomb , the TSA will detain you and call the FBI .

A 95 % failure rate is too high , but a 20 % one is n't .\nPrevious TSA excuses were that the results were isolated to a single airport , or not realistic simulations of terrorist behavior . That almost certainly was n't true then , but the TSA ca n't even argue that now .

Pretty much everyone I know has inadvertently carried a knife through airport security , and some people have told me about guns they mistakenly carried on airplanes . The TSA publishes statistics about how many guns it detects ; last year , it was 2,212 . This does n't mean the TSA missed 44,000 guns last year ; a weapon that is mistakenly left in a carry-on bag is going to be easier to detect than a weapon deliberately hidden in the same bag .

Security screening is an incredibly boring job , and almost all alerts are false alarms . It 's very hard for people to remain vigilant in this sort of situation , and sloppiness is inevitable .\nThere are also technology failures . We know that current screening technologies are terrible at detecting the plastic explosive PETN -- that 's what the underwear bomber had -- and that a disassembled weapon has an excellent chance of getting through airport security .

The only reason they 've been able to get away with the scam for so long is that there is n't much of a threat of terrorism to defend against .\nEven with all these actual and potential failures , there have been no successful terrorist attacks against airplanes since 9/11 . If there were lots of terrorists just waiting for us to let our guard down to destroy American planes , we would have seen attacks \u2014 attempted or successful \u2014 after all these years of screening failures . No one has hijacked a plane with a knife or a gun since 9/11 .
