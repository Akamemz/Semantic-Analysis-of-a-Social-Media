Breitbart , unsurprisingly , blamed it all on a supposed \u201c deep state \u201d of US national security officials committed to harming the Trump presidency .\nThe spin is meant to distract attention from the enormity of the new scandal \u2014 and from the likely repercussions of Trump \u2019 s actions . The White House has good reason for desperately hoping it can change the topic : The president \u2019 s gaffe will make US allies less likely to share vital intelligence and add new fuel to the administration \u2019 s ongoing war with the American intelligence community just when US spies can least afford the distraction .\nThat \u2019 s because Trump \u2019 s disclosures represent a direct threat to US counterterrorism efforts , which rely less on the skills of individual operatives and more on the web of intelligence-sharing agreements that Washington has with allies around the globe .\nThe best known is the decades-old Five Eyes agreement between the US , Canada , the United Kingdom , New Zealand , and Australia that calls for the nations to share information and not carry out espionage missions against one another .\nBut the US also maintains formal and informal intelligence-sharing arrangements with countries closer to the main battlefields of the war against ISIS and al-Qaeda . Those include deals with Jordan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Turkey , and other Middle Eastern nations that have worked hard to develop granular knowledge of the terror groups that threaten them at least as much as they threaten the West .\nThose are also precisely the kinds of agreements that could fall apart because of Trump \u2019 s cavalier decision to give Russia information Washington had received from one of its allies in the terror fight . As the Washington Post \u2019 s Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe write :\nThe information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government , officials said . The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia , and officials said Trump \u2019 s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State\nWe don \u2019 t yet know which country had its secrets given to Moscow , nor the exact details of the intelligence Trump shared .
