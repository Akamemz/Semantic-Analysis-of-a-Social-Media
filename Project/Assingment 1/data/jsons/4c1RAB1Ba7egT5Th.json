However , Yaniv \u2019 s identity has long been suspected by the public , according to John Carpay , President of the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms , which is representing five women Yaniv has filed complaints against .\nOne proud lesbian .

He believes multiple women have likely been forced to shut down their businesses as a result of Yaniv \u2019 s complaints , as he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . In the hearing Wednesday , Maria Da Silva , an immigrant from Brazil with young children , testified that Yaniv \u2019 s complaint forced her to close the Brazilian wax business she operated out of her home .\nThe women who refused Yaniv the procedure say they are not qualified to perform a Brazilian wax service on male genitalia , as it is entirely different from the service intended for women . An esthetician who does perform Brazilian waxes on men testified at an earlier hearing that this service requires completely different expertise .\nThe Human Rights Tribunal has not announced their decision on the cases , and will not do so until a few weeks or months have passed , according to Carpay .\nBesides being unqualified for the procedure , Carpay says the women facing complaints have religious and safety reasons for denying Yaniv the service . Esthetician Sukhi Hehar Gill , a practicing Sikh , says she denied Yaniv \u2019 s request for the procedure because it is contrary to her faith to travel to a client \u2019 s house if they are biologically male , according to the Justice Centre .\nYaniv posted a tweet Thursday arguing the refusal of women to wax her genitalia is \u201c about businesses and individuals using their religion and culture to refuse service to protected groups . \u201d\nThis is not about waxing .
