A federal law enforcement source told FoxNews.com Tuesday that prosecutors have convened a grand jury to investigate Mateen 's wife , Noor Salman , who could be charged as an accessory .\nFBI agents have interviewed Omar Mateen 's wife , Noor Salman , in the days since Sunday 's massacre that also wounded 53 more . She is reportedly cooperating , but formal charges could help ensure she told the feds all she knows .\nMultiple reports said the Rodeo , Calif. , home where Salman grew up was visited by the FBI Tuesday . The FBI has refused comment to the press outside of official media briefings .\nA federal law enforcement source additionally told Fox News that Salman knew of her husband 's deadly plans and did nothing to stop him .\nMateen died in a shootout with police early Sunday morning . While Salman has been widely referred to as Mateen 's wife , the only proof of their marriage is her listing as his wife on a 2013 mortgage document and family members who said the two were married and had a 3-year-old son .\nOn a separate front , the FBI is piecing together Mateen \u2019 s radical Islam roots , and two trips to Saudi Arabia could be a sign of his growing religious devotion . His stated reason for both the 2011 and 2012 trips was umrah , a Muslim pilgrimage to the Kingdom that is not as significant as the hajj , a trip all Muslims must make to Mecca at least once in their lives . Either or both of the trips could also have included a deadly diversion for terror training , according to experts who are dubious that a working-class Muslim-American would make the pilgrimage twice in two years .\nThe FBI took a computer , camera and other equipment from Mateen 's two-bedroom condominium in Fort Pierce , some 120 miles from the scene of the shooting and hours-long hostage situation that culminated in his death .\nAlthough ISIS has taken credit for the attack and lavished praise on Mateen , it is still unclear whether he received direction , or simply inspiration , from the terrorist group . However , Fox News reported Tuesday that Mateen was more than just an acquaintance of another radicalized terrorist who left Florida for Syria where he blew himself up in 2014 .\nFox News was told the relationship between Mateen and American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha -- who drove 16 tons of explosives into a Syrian government facility on behalf of Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front , was `` complex .
