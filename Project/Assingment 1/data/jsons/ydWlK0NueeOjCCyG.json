The move affects 30,000 employees , or about 5 percent of Wal-Mart 's total part-time workforce , but comes after the company already had scaled back the number of part-time workers who were eligible for health insurance coverage since 2011 .\nThe announcement follows similar decisions by Target , Home Depot and others to completely eliminate health insurance benefits for part-time employees . It also comes a day after Wal-Mart said it is teaming up with an online health insurance agency called DirectHealth.com to help customers shop for health insurance plans .\n`` We had to make some tough decisions , '' Sally Welborn , Wal-Mart 's senior vice president of benefits , told The Associated Press .\nWelborn said she did n't know how much Wal-Mart will save by dropping part-time employees , but added that the company will use a third-party organization to help part-time workers find insurance alternatives : `` We are trying to balance the needs of ( workers ) as well as the costs of ( workers ) as well as the cost to Wal-Mart .
