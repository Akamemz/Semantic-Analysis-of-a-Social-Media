Officers are alert to the fact that if they shoot a black individual , the odds of social outcry are far greater than if they shoot a white individual . \u201d\nIn fact , he said , officers involved in shootings have told him that they were actually relieved that the person they shot was white , not black .\n\u201c The second things is , I \u2019 ve had multiple officers tell me they were worried in the wake of a shooting because they shot a black person , and I \u2019 ve had multiple officers tell me that they were glad that the person they shot was white , \u201d Mr. Klinger said . \u201c Because then they knew they weren \u2019 t going to have to be subject to the racial harangue . \u201d\nThe interviews , which he conducted for a book he \u2019 s planning to finish this year , run directly counter to the prevailing view pushed by social justice groups , politicians and others : that shooting victims such as 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson were victims at least in part of racial discrimination against blacks among cops .\n\u201c Police officers \u2014 at least the ones I interviewed \u2014 are very sensitive to the race issue , but not in the way this popular narrative is running , i.e. , cops are out there trying to find young black men who don \u2019 t have guns so they can shoot them down like dogs in the street , \u201d Mr. Klinger said . \u201c That just isn \u2019 t anything I \u2019 ve found in any of the research that I \u2019 ve done . \u201d\nThe study , \u201c Racial and ethnic bias in decisions to shoot seen through a stronger lens : experimental results from high-fidelity laboratory simulations , \u201d was conducted by Mr. Klinger and Washington State University assistant research professor Lois James and criminal justice and criminology professor Bryan Vila .\nFor their research , the authors used a pioneering WSU simulation involving full-size , high-definition video instead of photos and handguns modified to shoot infrared beams instead of the \u201c shoot \u201d buttons typically used in deadly-force studies .\nAbout a third of the scenarios in the study were \u201c no shoot \u201d situations in which perpetrators of different races held cellphones or wallets , while the rest were \u201c shoot \u201d situations in which suspects were armed with knives or guns .\nThe study found that the 48 participants waited longest before firing on black suspects in \u201c shoot \u201d scenarios , even though the participants exhibited \u201c stronger threat responses \u201d when facing black suspects than with white or Hispanic suspects .\nEighty-five percent of the participants were white , and none was a police officer .
