    "content": "A day before leaving office , President Barack Obama broke one of his own records . By using the president \u2019 s pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes , he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history \u2014 breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week .\nIt \u2019 s the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president \u2019 s clemency power to get hundreds of people \u2014 most of them nonviolent drug offenders \u2014 out of prison sooner . And it tops off another presidential record : With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency , Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman ( excluding Gerald Ford \u2019 s clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers ) .\nDepending on how you look at it , Obama \u2019 s effort in the twilight of his presidency is either a historic act of criminal justice reform \u2014 or too little too late . Obama \u2019 s rejected thousands of petitions for reduced sentences , and there are still thousands more waiting for review \u2014 and the Trump administration , under Attorney General\u2013nominee Jeff Sessions , is extremely unlikely to give them a second look .\nThe Thursday actions are the last batch of clemency approvals that Obama will grant . But while it \u2019 s now clear that Obama \u2019 s done something very significant indeed , it \u2019 s also near-certain that it will , in some ways , fall short .\nThe president \u2019 s power of clemency \u2014 which includes both officially absolving people with criminal convictions of their crimes ( pardons ) and reducing sentences of people currently incarcerated ( commutations ) \u2014 is established in the Constitution , and it \u2019 s very broad . So even though pardons and commutations are given to individual people , it \u2019 s arguably the most direct tool the president has to reduce mass incarceration if he so chooses .\nIn the last year of his presidency , Obama has stepped up to the plate . He \u2019 s used the pardon power to reduce more sentences than any other president \u2014 thanks almost entirely to his administration \u2019 s actions over the past year .\nObama \u2019 s been a critic of mass incarceration , or at least of disproportionate sentences for drug crimes ( which are the most common type of crime among federal prisoners ) , since he came into office . But for the first several years of his presidency , he was historically stingy in using the pardon power to help prisoners he claimed were serving unfair sentences .\nThe change from then to now is a story of how easy it is for a single federal official to slow down a process \u2014 and how hard it is for a single official to speed it up .\nFor the first term of his presidency , the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney was a \u201c tough-on-crime \u201d holdover from the George W. Bush administration . The chief pardon attorney was so resistant to pardoning federal prisoners that in at least one case he withheld relevant evidence that would have made a pardon applicant look better when presenting the application to Obama for review .\nIn early 2014 , the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office \u2014 and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison . It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate , and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who \u2019 d been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels .\nThe applications came in . The approvals did not . It turned out that using the pardon power to grant big batches of commutations wasn \u2019 t just a matter of who was at the head of the pardon office , but how willing Department of Justice leadership and the White House were to take risks . ( When politicians are afraid that just one person they release can go on to commit another crime , it makes it hard to release anyone at all . )\nIn early 2016 , the pardon attorney Obama had hired to oversee the commutation push quit \u2014 with a letter making it clear that she didn \u2019 t feel the administration was keeping its promises on clemency . Days after her resignation , the commutations picked up . And they \u2019 ve barely stopped since .\nThousands of prisoners are still waiting \u2014 and President Trump is unlikely to help\nObama didn \u2019 t approve all the petitions he got . As of late December , nearly 14,000 applications for commutations ( many of them submitted per the White House \u2019 s 2014 request ) were still pending , along with more than 2,000 applications for full pardons . And the administration had already formally denied more than 16,000 petitions .\nObama could have approved every one of those applications , and it would still be a drop in the mass incarceration bucket \u2014 since his actions focused mostly on drug offenders . While about half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug crimes , prison sentences for drugs aren \u2019 t the biggest cause of mass incarceration in the US as a whole : Only about 16 percent of state prisoners , who make up about 87 percent of the overall prison population , are in for drug crimes . So a focus on reducing prison sentences for other crimes , including violent ones , is likely needed to truly end mass incarceration .\nAnd Obama \u2019 s clemency actions only captured a fraction of federal inmates . As of 2015 , there were around 92,000 federal prisoners in for drug crimes , and more than 100,000 in for other crimes \u2014 far more inmates than Obama \u2019 s nearly 2,000 clemency approvals reached .\nEven among drug offenders , Obama has reduced fewer prison sentences than the US Sentencing Commission did by reducing the recommended baseline for federal drug prisoners \u2014 a move that has already let out thousands of prisoners before their original release dates . And by commuting sentences rather than pardoning people , the president has released ex-prisoners into a world where their criminal records can still stop them from getting jobs , public housing , or the vote .\nBut most people would agree being out of prison without those things is still better than being in prison without them . The thousands of people who are waiting to hear about their commutations certainly believe that . So does the Obama administration .\nPresident-elect Trump ran on a \u201c tough on crime \u201d platform . He indirectly attacked Obama \u2019 s attempts at clemency \u2014 and by \u201c indirectly \u201d I mean \u201c exaggerated it to the point of lying , \u201d excoriating Obama for releasing \u201c thousands \u201d of \u201c violent criminals . \u201d\nSessions , Trump \u2019 s nominee for attorney general , is likewise a crime hawk . He \u2019 s criticized Obama \u2019 s use of the pardon power as a violation of the \u201c rule of law. \u201d It \u2019 s extremely unlikely that he \u2019 s going to turn around , once in office , and continue a policy that he vocally opposed .\nSome criminal justice reformers have urged Obama to commute sentences for whole categories of prisoners , to make the biggest possible impact before turning the executive branch over to people whose views on criminal justice are so different from his own . Others have just urged him to get through the stack of applications at the pardon office quicker .\nObama did the second , but it didn \u2019 t go in the way reformers would like \u2014 it \u2019 s resulted in thousands of rejections . And it now seems clear he won \u2019 t do the first . Obama will leave office having helped nearly 2,000 individuals \u2014 but will leave many more languishing behind bars .",
