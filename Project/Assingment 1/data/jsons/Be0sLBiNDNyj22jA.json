    "content": "Gary Cohn , the former second in command at Goldman Sachs , should follow Stephen Bannon out the door and resign as Donald Trump \u2019 s chief economic adviser in the White House . Unlike Bannon , he should resign on principle . He should resign\u2014not because of anything he has done wrong , in fact , quite the contrary\u2014but because it is the right thing for him to do in the wake of Trump \u2019 s disgraceful reaction to the horrific events that played out last weekend in Charlottesville , Virginia . He should resign despite the fact the stock markets will probably react negatively to the departure of one of the only halfway-sane economic voices in this administration . He should resign for his own dignity and so that the reputation he worked so hard to build on Wall Street during the last 30 years doesn \u2019 t get further destroyed by the monster that is Donald Trump .\nWill he ? That \u2019 s a question that plenty of people on Wall Street and in Washington have been debating this week . There has been some reporting since Trump \u2019 s pathetic question-and-answer session on Tuesday from the lobby of Trump Tower that Cohn is \u201c deeply upset , \u201d according to Maggie Haberman , at The New York Times , and \u201c disgusted , \u201d according to her colleague Glenn Thrush , about Trump \u2019 s defense of white nationalists , neo-Nazis , and their Tiki torch-carrying brethren . I am told Cohn \u201c is dying \u201d inside the Trump lunatic asylum , and that \u201c this is a real inflection point for him. \u201d It should be . During previous interviews with me , he has made it clear that it is increasingly difficult for him to stay in an administration that , among other things , has advocated keeping Muslims out of the country , rejected the Paris climate accord , and doesn \u2019 t seem to be able to accomplish the things he cares about . He has told me that he \u2019 s in it mainly for the chance to reform the tax code , which hasn \u2019 t been overhauled in 30 years .\nBut is he really sticking around Washington so that he can help people who are already rich pay less in taxes ? Is he really sticking around for the increasingly slim chance that comprehensive tax reform might happen ? Larry Summers , the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary ( who also once had Cohn \u2019 s job ) said on Bloomberg TV yesterday that the chances of meaningful tax reform are likely dead . So what gives , Gary ? Why put up with this shit anymore ? Following Trump \u2019 s Tuesday afternoon diatribe , I texted Cohn , wondering how he and Steve Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary\u2014both very wealthy , Jewish , former Goldman partners\u2014could stand by Trump \u2019 s side during the impromptu press conference where he doubled-down on his failure to condemn the white nationalists that marched Charlottesville , Virginia , resulting in the killing of Heather Heyer . He did not reply . I still have not heard from him .\nThere is no reason for him to stick around anymore . There is no economic agenda that has much of a near-term chance of getting done . He has already successfully converted his $ 250 million fortune in Goldman stock into Treasury securities on a tax-deferred basis . No one can take away from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 the fact that he was the nation \u2019 s top political economic adviser , just as were his former Goldman colleagues Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman . Summers has also strongly implied that he should resign , on principle . ( He said if he were in Cohn \u2019 s shoes he would resign but added that he learned \u201c long ago \u201d not to \u201c stand in other people \u2019 s shoes. \u201d ) So what \u2019 s holding Cohn back from doing what is so obviously the right thing for him to do ? Why is he continuing to serve such an incompetent leader ?\nI think the answer is ego . Cohn wants Trump to name him chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , replacing Janet Yellen , whose term expires next February . It would be the perfect way for him to fulfill his boundless ambitions and also give him a graceful exit out of the White House . If he got the job\u2014which he isn \u2019 t particularly well qualified for ; he \u2019 s not an economist , not that that is a prerequisite ( Summers is far better qualified but not under consideration ) \u2014he would become the first Goldman Sachs alumnus to become Fed chairman . ( Goldman Sachs alumni head up the Bank of England and the European Central Bank . ) That would put him in truly rarefied air\u2014above Rubin , Mnuchin and Hank Paulson , all of whom have served as Treasury secretary .
