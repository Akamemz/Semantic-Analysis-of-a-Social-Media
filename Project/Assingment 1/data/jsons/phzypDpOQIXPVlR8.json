    "content": "This weekend , as violence and protests over the death of George Floyd shook the country , President Donald Trump called for \u201c law and order. \u201d \u201c We support the overwhelming majority of police officers who are \u2026 devoted public servants , \u201d said Trump . \u201c It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of American democracy : the rule of law and our independent system of justice . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a standard Republican message , and there \u2019 s a lot of truth to it . But Trump doesn \u2019 t believe in the rule of law . His record shows an uglier pattern : He supports cops when they target people of color . He opposes cops when they target him and his friends .\nIn 1989 , five black and Latino teenagers were arrested for a horrific rape in New York . Trump responded with a full-page newspaper ad that demanded , \u201c BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY . BRING BACK OUR POLICE ! \u201d Trump insisted that the teens were guilty , even after they were exonerated . In 2012 , he endorsed police surveillance of American Muslims . In 2014 , when President Barack Obama spoke about the killing of Eric Garner , Trump tweeted , \u201c Obama now wants to deny due process to the police. \u201d In 2015 , when violence erupted over the death of Freddie Gray , Trump jeered : \u201c Our great African American President hasn \u2019 t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore ! \u201d\nAs president , Trump stayed on this theme . His inaugural address depicted an \u201c American carnage \u201d of \u201c crime and gangs and drugs. \u201d He praised police , especially when they battled MS-13 , a Latino gang . He told officers not to worry about protecting suspects from injury during arrests . All along , he assumed that law enforcement was on his side . He bragged that \u201c the cops , \u201d like \u201c the plumbers \u201d and \u201c the truck drivers , \u201d were \u201c the people that like me best . \u201d\nBut not every cop was smitten by Trump . In 2017 , then\u2013FBI Director James Comey refused to clear the president and his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in the Russia investigation . So Trump fired Comey . In January 2019 , Trump discovered that the bureau had launched an inquiry into the firing . \u201c Wow , just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI \u2026 opened up an investigation on me , \u201d the president tweeted . Trump needed to explain why he , the putative friend of cops , had fired the head of the FBI . So he labeled Comey a \u201c bad cop , \u201d a \u201c crooked cop , \u201d and a \u201c dirty cop . \u201d\nIn March 2019 , special counsel Robert Mueller , another former FBI director , filed a report documenting Trump \u2019 s misconduct in the Russia investigation . Trump responded by calling every member of the investigative team a \u201c dirty cop. \u201d He applied that slur to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , former FBI agent Peter Strzok , former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , the FBI \u201c leadership , \u201d \u201c people in the Justice Department , \u201d and \u201c Mueller and the gang. \u201d Trump claimed that they had \u201c forged documents , \u201d had used \u201c an illegal document , \u201d and had tampered with evidence . He said they had been caught \u201c in the act \u201d and had been exposed as \u201c dirty cops \u201d by the Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general .\nNone of this was true . But Trump \u2019 s smear campaign served three objectives . First , it helped him turn the investigation of himself into an investigation of the cops . \u201c It was an illegal investigation , \u201d said Trump . \u201c We never did anything wrong . The people that did something wrong were the other side\u2014the dirty cops. \u201d On Twitter , he demanded , \u201c INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS ! \u201d He suggested that the \u201c Dirty ( Filthy ) Cops \u201d should be put \u201c in jail for treason . \u201d\nSecond , the anti-cop narrative cast Trump as the hero . In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , he called Comey \u201c one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen. \u201d Purging Comey and Comey \u2019 s associates\u2014essentially , anyone who had investigated Trump\u2014was \u201c one of my greatest achievements , \u201d said Trump , \u201c because we have no place in our country for people like that . \u201d\nThird , the anti-cop narrative laid a foundation for reversing the convictions of Trump \u2019 s henchmen . \u201c If Comey & the top people in the FBI were dirty cops , \u201d Trump tweeted , \u201c wouldn \u2019 t all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed ? \u201d When Trump was asked about pardoning Roger Stone\u2014another adviser convicted in the Russia inquiry\u2014he said Stone and Flynn were victims of a \u201c hoax \u201d investigation run by \u201c dirty cops . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s attacks on law enforcement culminated in a bizarre commencement address to reformed ex-convicts in February . He was supposed to talk about repentance and rehabilitation . Instead , he accused \u201c dirty cops \u201d of railroading Stone and Flynn . Stone had been convicted of witness tampering . \u201c But the man that he was tampering didn \u2019 t seem to have much of a problem with it , \u201d Trump complained to the ex-convicts . \u201c And it \u2019 s not like the tampering that I see on television when you watch a movie . \u201d\nStill , Trump was happy to praise cops who revered him and shared his resentments . In October 2019 , the police union in Minneapolis\u2014where Floyd would die at the hands of four officers\u2014peddled \u201c Cops for Trump \u201d T-shirts on its website . Trump promoted the T-shirts and thanked the police for supporting him and \u201c fighting the Radical Left Mayor. \u201d On Oct. 10 , at a nearly all-white rally in Minneapolis , he declared , \u201c Cops love Trump . Trump loves cops. \u201d More than a dozen white officers , including the head of the police union , paraded onstage to shake the president \u2019 s hand . Then Trump launched into his next riff : \u201c For many years , leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia. \u201d The crowd booed .\nThe past month should dispel any doubts about the racial pattern in Trump \u2019 s thinking . On April 30 , he accused \u201c dirty , filthy cops \u201d of victimizing Flynn . On May 8 , he accused the FBI of tampering with Flynn \u2019 s interview records . On May 23 , he castigated former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to rein in the \u201c dirty cops. \u201d On May 26 , he called them \u201c dishonest slime bags. \u201d Then Floyd \u2019 s death engulfed the country , and Trump switched sides . He denounced the \u201c THUGS \u201d rioting over Floyd \u2019 s death , as he had previously denounced , with an explicitly racial jab at Obama , the protesters after Gray \u2019 s death . He warned , in the words of an infamous racist police chief , \u201c When the looting starts , the shooting starts. \u201d He threatened protesters and rioters with \u201c vicious dogs , \u201d \u201c ominous weapons , \u201d and \u201c the unlimited power of our Military. \u201d At a White House meeting with business executives on Friday , Trump insisted that on the whole , \u201c Our police have been very outstanding . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no mystery left about the president \u2019 s views on cops . He loves them when they \u2019 re targeting minorities . But when they investigate him or his friends , he calls them dirty . He \u2019 s not interested in order , justice , or the rule of law .
