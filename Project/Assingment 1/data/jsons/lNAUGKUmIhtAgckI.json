    "content": "Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces , but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence . The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders .\nIt ended a high-stakes two-day crisis and practical siege of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world . The attack prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East .\nIn an orchestrated assault , hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound , destroying a reception area , smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters .

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound .\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces , an umbrella group of state-allied militias \u2014 many backed by Iran \u2014 called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government , saying `` your message has been received . '' By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River , outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies .\nU.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead . `` After achieving the intended aim , we pulled out from this place triumphantly , '' said Fadhil al-Gezzi , a militia supporter . `` We rubbed America 's nose in the dirt .
