I was at the Museum of American History. \u201d \u201c Before DACA I always felt like I was in between two worlds . I was born in Honduras . But if I were to go back to Honduras , it \u2019 s like I \u2019 m foreign to them. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s a tug of war . When you \u2019 re undocumented , you \u2019 re always just aware of the situations , of the locations , who you were talking to , how you are interacting with folks , ensuring that you don \u2019 t do anything that will bring attention to you because you live a life of shadows. \u201d \u201c You know , I have been able to accomplish a lot more than when I was undocumented . To get a social security number , loans from the bank , a better job. \u201d \u201c Every time my parents call me after 11 p.m. , it \u2019 s like my heart is racing . When you are an immigrant in this country , you wake up every day with the fear that you could be taken away , right , that your family could be broken up. \u201d \u201c I have been preparing my kids of , for , you know , These are the risk [ s ] . This could happen to your dad and to me. \u201d \u201c I just can \u2019 t imagine , you know , my nieces and nephews being separated from their parents or them going back to a country that they don \u2019 t know because this is their home . They shouldn \u2019 t live with that fear that I had to grow up with . That \u2019 s not a normal life . That \u2019 s not normal . And I know that like my friends that are U.S. citizens don \u2019 t go through that . And nobody should go through that. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m not leaving my home , and I think if Trump ever wanted to talk to us , if he wanted to talk to these Dreamers he would realize that we love this country . We want to stay here , and ... \u201d \u201c ... if it \u2019 s taken away , I \u2019 m losing my job , I \u2019 m losing the opportunity to work and school . People don \u2019 t understand but it \u2019 s a big thing , it \u2019 s a huge thing , it \u2019 s privileges that some people here take for granted. \u201d \u201c Taking DACA away is like taking a family member away from me . That wall that Donald Trump wants to build , you know , it \u2019 s putting a wall in front of me where I won \u2019 t be able to move forward . You are not just taking something away from us , but you \u2019 re taking something away from this country. \u201d \u201c This land is not a white America . It \u2019 s not . This is a land of immigrants. \u201d \u201c I mean , I was already a person before DACA . A lot of people say , \u2018 Oh , you know , what \u2019 s going to happen after DACA ? \u2019 I \u2019 m not going down without a fight. \u201d \u201c You know , whatever happens next , I love this country and I belong here. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m fighting for my family , \u201c I \u2019 m fighting for the friends of mine that can \u2019 t even stand up because they \u2019 re scared. \u201d \u201c We just want to stay here and contribute to this country , to the economy ...
