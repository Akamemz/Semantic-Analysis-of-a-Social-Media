    "content": "Americans are being subjected to a massive public relations assault attempting to persuade them that \u201c fracking \u201d for natural gas and oil is the key to America \u2019 s energy future and that this change will free them forever from the bondage of oil imports .\nWhat has really changed is the nation \u2019 s energy conversation . Until recently , it was about how the United States should reduce its dependency on climate-changing fossil fuels . Now the \u201c conversation \u201d has become a harangue about the energy , jobs , and tax revenues the industry insists will flow from fracking and how these outweigh environmental concerns .\nThe data do not adequately support these claims . Though the fracking revolution is only a few years old , it \u2019 s already losing steam . There are several reasons why .\nFracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is a method of extracting natural gas and oil from low-permeability ( usually shale ) rock formations that don \u2019 t yield to conventional technologies . In the process , water , sand , and various chemicals are injected into shale rock at high pressure to open fractures in the rock and release gas or oil .\nA few years ago , fracking for shale gas or tight oil was still novel and confined to small regions , but now tens of thousands of wells have been drilled . Millions of Americans have personal experience with the noise , truck traffic , fumes , and local political turmoil that seem inevitably to follow in fracking \u2019 s wake . Hundreds of anti-fracking citizen groups have formed , public sentiment seems to be turning , and communities have begun seeking bans or moratoriums on the practice .\nEnvironmental problems can \u2019 t be swept under the carpet any longer . The image of a home-owner lighting his tap water on fire in Josh Fox \u2019 s documentary film \u201c Gasland \u201d has become a clich\u00e9 ; still , for a while the natural gas industry successfully argued that adverse effects from fracking on water , air , soil , wildlife , livestock , and human health are negligible .\nIndustry-funded studies declared the practice safe , and the Environmental Protection Agency appeared to back them up .

Former Mobil Oil vice president , Louis W. Allstadt , who spent his career running oil production operations and company mergers , now speaks on behalf of anti-fracking resistance groups .
