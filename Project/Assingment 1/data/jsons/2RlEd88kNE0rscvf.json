Mark Meadows has started negotiating a deal with a top House moderate , Rep. Tom MacArthur ( R-NJ ) , which would work to stabilize Obamacare \u2019 s individual markets , funding key payments to insurers while giving states more flexibility for their own health care programs .\nMeanwhile , on Friday , while most of Congress was home on recess , three House Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Reps. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) , Scott Perry ( PA ) , Tom Garrett ( VA ) \u2014 were on the House floor introducing and signing a discharge petition that would force the House to vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill .\nRepublicans have been stuck in an intra-party battle between reviving Obamacare repeal or moving on and taking small steps to stabilize the law since last month \u2019 s failure in the Senate . The Freedom Caucus is now at the heart of that predicament : While they make a very public gesture to force another repeal vote , their leader is also setting up a scenario in which the law could largely remain in place .\nThere is a new more moderate plan in nascent stages\nMeadows has entered into initial talks with MacArthur about a much more modest health care bill that would actually be designed to stabilize Obamacare , as Axios first reported .\nA House aide emphasized that these talks are in their early stages and do not represent an endorsement from the full Freedom Caucus .\nThe outline of the emerging deal is pretty simple , per the aide :\nCongress would authorize cost-sharing reduction payments , which compensate insurers for providing discounts on out-of-pocket costs for lower-income customers .\nIn exchange , states would be given more flexibility under an existing Obamacare waiver program to pursue their own health care policies .\nThe cost-sharing reduction payments , which \u2588\u2588\u2588 has explained in great detail , have been repeatedly threatened by Trump in recent weeks . Because of an ongoing lawsuit , Trump could cut off the payments at any time , which could cause insurers to either hike their premiums or drop out of the market altogether . Some top Republicans in Congress have urged Trump not to follow through on the threat , but congressional action is the only sure way to prevent it .\nBut other Republicans , particularly the most ardent anti-Obamacare members in the Freedom Caucus , would be reluctant to support funding for the health care law without getting anything in return . So their win in this deal would be more flexibility for the state waivers already available under Obamacare .\nConservatives have been seeking such state flexibility throughout the Obamacare repeal debate \u2014 it \u2019 s not yet clear how the new proposal would differ from previous iterations . There is a wide range of possibilities : The waivers could give states a blank check to undo Obamacare \u2019 s insurance regulations or they could leave most of the law \u2019 s safeguards in place . It would depend entirely on the specific legislative language .\nPart of the theory for conservatives , per the House aide , is that addressing the waivers in the stabilization bill would eliminate the need to deal with them in a bigger repeal-and-replace bill that Meadows and others still hope to revive . Those proposals have consistently run into trouble under the Senate \u2019 s procedural rules , which limit what policies Republicans can include in a \u201c budget reconciliation \u201d bill that needs only 50 votes to advance in the upper chamber .\nBut it \u2019 s not clear how this actually helps Republicans get the 50th vote in the Senate for any Obamacare repeal bill . The objections from the Republican senators who voted against three different repeal bills last month were not about the waiver proposals .\nRepublican leaders also have a packed schedule for the foreseeable future , with government funding and the federal debt ceiling on tap in September , and seem genuinely eager to move onto other issues like tax reform rather than continuing to litigate health care .\nSo in the end , this could wind up being the best deal the Freedom Caucus and other anti-Obamacare Republicans can get .
