    "content": "Finally , \u201c There 's been much discussion of the Republican Party 's high-profile losses on Tuesday in Kentucky and Virginia , but historic GOP losses in Pennsylvania might be more concerning for the party in 2020 \u2026 Pennsylvania is a key swing state that went for President Donald Trump in 2016 and will be a central battleground state in 2020 . Trump won the state by less than 1 percentage point \u2014 or about 44,000 votes of the more than 6 million cast \u2014 handing him Pennsylvania 's 20 electoral votes. \u201d Eliza Relman , Business Insider\n\u201c The real winners [ were ] Medicaid expansion and education \u2026 Republicans in Arizona , Oklahoma and elsewhere have seen that tangling with teachers usually doesn \u2019 t work out well ; they \u2019 ve also learned that as much as they may dislike the Affordable Care Act , it \u2019 s a political nightmare to mess with . Every time an election like this happens , it makes politicians more likely to heed those lessons. \u201d Jonathan Bernstein , Bloomberg\nSome caution that \u201c To interpret [ Mr. Beshear \u2019 s win ] as a sign of Mr. Trump \u2019 s and Mr. McConnell \u2019 s waning power in a Republican stronghold is shortsighted . One glance at the other statewide races tells the tale : As Mr. Trump himself tweeted Wednesday morning , all were won handily by Republicans . Mr. McConnell \u2019 s fabled political organization appears to remain intact \u2026 those breaking out the bourbon in the belief that Trump Fever is abating in Kentucky should put away their glasses. \u201d Jason Kyle Howard , New York Times\n\u201c Matt Bevin made it his top priority as governor to shred the ACA\u2026 He shifted 31,000 people off Medicaid and S-Chip , the state children \u2019 s health-insurance plan . He added work requirements for Medicaid , and other practical barriers to coverage . Bevin \u2019 s personal behavior may have been extreme , but his policy priorities as governor were squarely in the GOP mainstream . Squeezing the ACA has been Trump policy , too . Nationwide , Medicaid and S-Chip enrollment has declined by 1.7 million over the past two years , a decline too big to be explained solely by improvements in the job market\u2026Trump is a historically unpopular president , delivering a historically unpopular agenda . If that message failed in Kentucky , where will it succeed ? \u201d David Frum , The Atlantic\n\u201c In Virginia , voters demonstrated that support for gun control is now an asset , not a liability , in American politics . More broadly : Railing against impeachment and attacking Democrats as \u2018 socialists \u2019 won \u2019 t get the job done for Republicans when the GOP finds itself on the wrong end of questions such as health care and education\u2026 Trump \u2019 s failure to rally Republicans with his anti-impeachment message in Kentucky \u2014 a state the president carried by 30 points and that is home to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) , up for reelection next year \u2014 should give Republicans pause about a Trump-centric approach to their own political futures\u2026 Voters want elections to be about them , not the narcissist in the White House. \u201d E.J . Dionne Jr. , Washington Post\n\u201c Some of the forces at work were demographic : an influx of immigrants , a tech boom that brought a surge of highly educated and affluent residents to the northern suburbs . But the wounds the Republicans have suffered have also been self-inflicted , as their party in Virginia was taken over by hard-line forces on the right\u2026 After the state was shaken by a mass shooting in Virginia Beach that left a dozen people dead , these were the Republicans who abruptly shut down a special legislative session on gun control after only 90 minutes without considering a single bill\u2026 they were not even willing to contemplate expanding background checks or \u2018 red flag \u2019 laws to take weapons away from people deemed to be dangerous. \u201d Karen Tumulty , Washington Post\nThe co-executive director of New Virginia Majority writes , \u201c We talk to people , all year , about issues that are important to them : affordable health care , access to a good education , reforming the criminal justice system , protecting voting rights and making sure our communities have clean air , water and public lands . That is what voters responded to this fall\u2026 Democrats and national progressive organizations have the resources to take their case to the people and win , but they have to start early and organize relentlessly . When they lose , they have to stay in place and keep fighting for every political inch they can get . No place is unwinnable forever. \u201d Tram Nguyen , New York Times\n\u201c In 2017 , Democrats were severely disadvantaged by a Republican-drawn racial gerrymander that trapped a huge number of black voters in a handful of noncompetitive districts for nearly a decade . By 2019 , that gerrymander was dead , killed off by the courts\u2026 Tuesday \u2019 s blowout demonstrates that there \u2019 s no mysterious or insurmountable hurdle that organically prevents Democrats from translating a landslide ( in overall votes ) into a majority in the General Assembly . The problem was not that Democratic voters tend to cluster in urban regions , as some Republicans have long claimed . The problem was illicit redistricting . Now the chief question facing Virginia Democrats is whether they will engage in tit-for-tat gerrymandering after the 2020 census , capitalizing upon their power to entrench Republicans in the minority. \u201d Mark Joseph Stern , Slate\nThe right argues that Bevin \u2019 s loss was an outlier , but nevertheless is concerned about what the overall results say about GOP prospects .\nThe right argues that Bevin \u2019 s loss was an outlier , but nevertheless is concerned about what the overall results say about GOP prospects .\n\u201c Bevin is the most unpopular governor in the country , according to data from Morning Consult , which at last count found that just 32 percent of registered voters in the state approved of the job he was doing while 56 percent disapproved\u2026 He attempted to push hugely unpopular reforms to the state \u2019 s pension and entitlement programs , as well as to its education system , earning him powerful enemies in both parties . His abrasive style turned off voters and legislators alike . These weaknesses were likely the biggest factor in his loss to Beshear\u2026\n\u201c [ Moreover ] until Bevin \u2019 s election in 2015 , Democrats had held the governorship in Kentucky for almost the entirety of the past two decades . Though Bevin \u2019 s loss isn \u2019 t a great sign for the GOP , it also isn \u2019 t evidence that the party is collapsing in Kentucky , especially given that the other five major statewide contests last night went to Republicans . Republican attorney-general candidate Daniel Cameron , for instance , defeated his Democratic opponent by about 15 points , and in the process raked in well over 100,000 more votes than either Bevin or Beshear . Every other GOP candidate on the ballot won his or her contest by at least 15 points . \u201d\n\u201c Given how close this race was \u2014 Bevin lost by less than 5,000 votes \u2014 it 's understandable he 'd want a recount , or a recanvass at the very least , to ensure that all the tallies were conducted correctly . But as soon as that process is complete , Bevin should put an end to this chaos and concede . If he doesn \u2019 t , he risks becoming the next Stacey Abrams , the failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate , who to this day pretends she was robbed of the governorship despite losing to Gov . Brian Kemp by over 50,000 votes\u2026\n\u201c Instead of admitting her loss , Abrams vilified Kemp and encouraged the creation of a myth that voter suppression somehow caused her narrow defeat . Republicans rightly criticized Abrams for playing the victim and abandoning individual responsibility . They should now demand the same from Bevin , who is crying foul play without evidence , just like Abrams . Bevin lost the Kentucky race not because Democrats skewed the results , but because he was so deeply unpopular among his own red-leaning electorate that they chose a Democrat instead . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats watched to their dismay as the political reaction to Barack Obama \u2019 s polarizing governance cost them the House , most governorships and state legislatures , and finally the Senate and the White House . Republicans are now experiencing the reverse effect under President Trump\u2026 This turnout trend has now continued for three Novembers , and Republicans who try to explain it away are fooling themselves . The GOP under Mr. Trump is losing more college-educated suburban voters , especially women , than it is gaining rural voters or working-class former Democrats\u2026\n\u201c The fair judgment a year from Election Day in 2020 is that Mr. Trump is highly vulnerable in his bid for a second term . He could benefit if the economy rebounds from its recent 2 % rate of growth , and perhaps Democrats bent on impeachment will overreach . But Mr. Trump may need Democrats to nominate an opponent whose agenda is far enough to the left to scare suburban voters who are tired of the daily melodrama of the Trump Presidency . \u201d\n\u201c A down-on-its-heels , opioid-ravaged , working-class , alienated electorate found its champion in Trump\u2026 Trump has made Trump voters , but not Republicans , out of working-class independents and Democrats , and he has madeDemocratic voters out of independents and Republicans . Trump has also motivated Democrats to unprecedented levels . The net effect is a massive shift of the electorate towards Democrats\u2026\n\u201c The results in 2018 and 2019 don \u2019 t mean the white working-class independents have soured on Trump . They mean that the populist love of Trump was never a love of the GOP\u2026 For Trump , it may look like an even trade : lose the wealthy whites and gain the working-class whites . But for the rest of his party , it \u2019 s one-sided : lose the wealthy whites but don \u2019 t gain anything . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
