    "content": "In a congressional special election in suburban Atlanta last night , Jon Ossoff , a thirty-year-old Democrat , won far more votes than any Republican challenger , but not quite enough to avoid a runoff with a former Georgia secretary of state named Karen Handel . The progressive energy of the first months of the Trump Administration had gathered behind Ossoff , and his campaign raised more than eight million dollars , an astonishing amount , much of it in small donations from around the country . Some of the progressive enthusiasm had to do with the sense of possibility\u2014prosperous Southern suburbs trended toward Hillary Clinton in the Presidential election\u2014but it was also about the sheer thrill of planting a flag in enemy territory . The seat , in Georgia \u2019 s Sixth District , was once held by Newt Gingrich . Speaking around midnight , Ossoff conceded that the election might soon move to a runoff . \u201c But let me tell you this , \u201d he said . \u201c There is no doubt that this is already a victory for the ages. \u201d His chances in the runoff , two months away , are something like fifty-fifty .\nOssoff , who was raised in the district and attended Georgetown University \u2019 s School of Foreign Service , looks his age , with an undergraduate \u2019 s flop of hair , and for much of the campaign his youth had been the main talking point about him . Republicans spent a million dollars to air an advertisement that featured Ossoff playing Han Solo in a video made by his college a-cappella group . But Ossoff \u2019 s youth also gave him an outsider sheen , which helped to amplify his appeal to grassroots progressives . One biographical detail , much repeated , was that Ossoff owns only two suits , one gray and one blue .\nDespite these sartorial restrictions , Ossoff has spent most of his working life on Capitol Hill , as a staffer for the Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson , who represents Georgia \u2019 s Fourth District , also in the Atlanta suburbs . Ossoff managed the identity-politics currents of the Democratic Party adeptly . His early campaign literature showed him linking arms , Selma-style , with the civil-rights hero and longtime Congressman John Lewis , of Georgia \u2019 s Fifth , whose endorsement he had secured .
