Border security\n\nThe bill summary introduces two statuses on the pathway to legal residency: registered provisional immigrant (RPI) and lawful permanent resident. Neither is attainable without border security, with the exception of immigrants eligible for the DREAM Act.\n\nTo be considered eligible, an undocumented immigrant cannot have arrived in the United States after December 31, 2011, and cannot have any felony convictions in the United States or abroad.\n\nBut smaller offenses can also block residency. For example, the applicant cannot accumulate three misdemeanor convictions, such as reckless driving, trespassing or vandalism. Voting illegally also triggers ineligibility and authorities can turn back applicants if they have certain infectious diseases or questionable \"morality.\"\n\nTime and money\n\nLegal status can also be pricey. An undocumented immigrant must pay a penalty of up to $500 for having come to the United States illegally and also pay any owed back taxes as part of attaining provisional consideration.\n\nBut once the applicant qualifies for that status, the registered provisional immigrant may work for any U.S. employer and is free to travel outside the country.\n\nThe status lasts for six years and can be extended for an additional $500 fee, if the applicant has not gotten into any trouble with the law.\n\nAfter 10 years as provisional, an immigrant may become a lawful permanent resident by following the same guidelines other immigrants must use to receive a green card, which includes a fee of $1,000.\n\nAgain, before any provisional status RPI is allowed to transition into lawful permanent resident status, the Southern border must be certifiably secure.\n\nIn addition, the secretary of Homeland Security must have \"implemented a mandatory employment verification system to be used by all employers to prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining employment in the United States,\" according to the bill summary.\n\nMeeting with Obama\n\nTwo senators from the \"Gang of Eight\" -- John McCain, R-Arizona, and Chuck Schumer, D-New York -- discussed the bill with President Barack Obama on Tuesday at the White House.\n\nOut of respect for the victims of the violence that marred the marathon, Schumer and McCain canceled a news conference on Tuesday where the proposal was to have been formally rolled out.\n\nThe other legislators in the \"Gang of Eight\" are Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois.\n\nMembers of the Republican-led House of Representatives, which is typically more conservative than the Senate, are working on their own immigration overhaul plan, which also includes border security measures.\n\nBlue card for ag workers\n\nThe \"Gang of Eight\" proposal calls for issuing agricultural workers a new type of legal status card: a blue card.\n\nAgricultural workers who are currently in the country illegally can apply for the card if they have worked in the U.S. agriculture industry for at least 100 days in the two years prior to Dec. 31, 2012.\n\nApplicants must also pay a $400 fee, show they have paid their taxes and have not committed a criminal offense.\n\nThe bill sets caps for new guest agricultural workers.
