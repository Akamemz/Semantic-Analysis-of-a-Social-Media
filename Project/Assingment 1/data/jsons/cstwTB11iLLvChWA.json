    "content": "One of the overlooked aspects of President Obama \u2019 s decision to delay taking executive action on deportations is the degree to which it helped out Republicans . The emerging conventional wisdom is that by punting on the issue , Obama did a favor to Democrats running in red states who were afraid that a renewed focus on immigration would anger conservatives and boost turnout for their Republican opponents . But , as anyone who \u2019 s been paying attention for the last nine years can tell you , immigration debates tend to be very thorny issues for Republicans as well .\nBefore Obama made his announcement , Republican leaders in Congress were very concerned that the hard-right faction of the House GOP would mount a rebellion if the party didn \u2019 t use the upcoming debate over government funding to try and block Obama on immigration . \u201c If Obama does move forward with an executive action , \u201d Rep.

Whenever the Democrats find themselves in a politically awkward position on immigration , Cruz can be counted on to swoop in and put the spotlight right back on himself and the GOP .\nWhen the controversy over the crush of immigrant minors at the border was at its height this summer , Democrats were paralyzed by internal divisions and arguing among themselves over how to address it . But then Cruz popped up and started demanding that legislation to address the border crisis include language to undo DACA , making himself a lightning rod for anti-immigrant sentiment .
