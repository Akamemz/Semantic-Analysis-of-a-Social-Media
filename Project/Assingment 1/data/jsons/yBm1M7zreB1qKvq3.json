    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014On the eve of a critical Senate hearing that could decide the fate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , a third woman came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s as partisan anger deepened on both sides .\nThe revelations shocked Capitol Hill , where Republican lawmakers are seeking to advance a nomination that legal scholars and lawmakers have said could cement a conservative majority .\nJudge Kavanaugh \u2019 s judicial elevation , once expected to move smoothly through the Senate , now hangs on the votes of a handful of GOP senators who said they were troubled by the late-breaking claims . Sens . Jeff Flake of Arizona , Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all said they would determine their votes after Thursday \u2019 s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing .\nWith a 51-49 advantage , Republicans can \u2019 t afford more than one defection , assuming no Democrat votes for him .\nAt the hearing , Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford , who has accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers , are scheduled to testify separately about the alleged incident . The judge has denied Dr. Ford \u2019 s claims .\nCommittee aides also were seeking on Wednesday to speak with the judge \u2019 s latest accuser , Julie Swetnick , who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh was at a party in the early 1980s when she was gang-raped and that he tried to get women drunk at several gatherings . She wasn \u2019 t scheduled to appear at the hearing .\nA second accuser , Deborah Ramirez , alleged in a New Yorker story published last Sunday that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party when they were both freshmen at Yale .\nMr. Kavanaugh has forcefully denied all of the allegations against him , saying at one point he felt like he was in the Twilight Zone . \u201c This is crazy town\u2014it \u2019 s a smear campaign , \u201d Mr. Kavanaugh told committee aides .\nSenate Judiciary Committee staff in a statement late Wednesday laid out the committee \u2019 s actions to investigate the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh , including witnesses they had contacted to attempt to corroborate the claims . They also noted that since Dr. Ford made her allegations public , committee staffers have spoken to two men\u2014one of whom has been interviewed twice and has submitted a written statement\u2014who believe that they , not Judge Kavanaugh , committed the assault Dr. Ford described .\nA spokesman for Dr. Ford \u2019 s lawyer didn \u2019 t immediately respond to a request for comment .\nDuring a news conference Wednesday , President Trump said the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are \u201c all false to me , \u201d but he left open the possibility that he could be persuaded otherwise after Thursday \u2019 s hearing .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to see what happens tomorrow . I \u2019 m going to be watching , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Believe it or not I \u2019 m going to see what \u2019 s said . It \u2019 s possible that they will be convincing . \u201d\nBoth Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh released testimony they plan to deliver at Thursday \u2019 s hearing , giving a glimpse of the conflicting stories they intend to tell . Judge Kavanaugh addressed more directly than he has in the past the issue of his drinking in high school .\n\u201c I was not perfect in those days , just as I am not perfect today , \u201d he intends to tell senators . \u201c I drank beer with my friends , usually on weekends . Sometimes I had too many . In retrospect , I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now . But\u2026I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes . \u201d\nDr. Ford plans to deliver a detailed description of the alleged attack , when she has said Judge Kavanaugh , at a party , groped her and tried to take off her clothes . \u201c I tried to yell for help , \u201d her statement says . \u201c When I did , Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming . This was what terrified me the most , and has had the most impact on my life . \u201d\nThe accusations have emerged as a test of how Congress handles sexual-misconduct issues in the age of the \u201c # Me Too \u201d movement , which could influence the midterm elections . Republican lawmakers , concerned about the optics of their 11-man judiciary committee roster , hired a female outside counsel to do most of their questioning of Dr. Ford .\nThe committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination on Friday , and the full Senate could act on it early next week .\nOn Wednesday , Ms. Swetnick issued a sworn statement , made public in a tweet by attorney Michael Avenatti , alleging that between 1981 and 1982 , she became aware of efforts by Judge Kavanaugh and his high-school friend , Mark Judge , to \u201c \u2018 spike \u2019 the \u2018 punch \u2019 \u201d at house parties she attended with drugs \u201c and/or grain alcohol \u201d and \u201c target \u201d women .\nIn a statement released by the White House on Wednesday , Judge Kavanaugh called the allegations \u201c ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. \u201d Of Ms. Swetnick , he said : \u201c I don \u2019 t know who this is and this never happened. \u201d Mr. Judge \u2019 s lawyer denied the allegations .\nMs. Swetnick claimed she attended more than 10 house parties in the Washington area between 1981 and 1983 with Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge , and saw them \u201c drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct , including being overly aggressive with girls \u201d and grabbing them \u201c without their consent . \u201d\nShe said that in 1982 , she was drugged and raped by a group of boys , and said Messrs. Kavanaugh and Judge were \u201c present \u201d when she was victimized . She said witnesses could verify her account and that she told people about the attack shortly after it happened .\nShe also said she had a \u201c firm recollection \u201d that at these house parties , boys lined up outside rooms \u201c waiting for their \u2018 turn \u2019 with a girl inside the room , \u201d and that those boys included Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge .\nHigh-school friends of Judge Kavanaugh on Wednesday rebutted the new allegations of sexual misconduct . In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee , more than 60 people who said they knew the Supreme Court nominee in high school dismissed as \u201c nonsense \u201d accusations that he spiked drinks at parties so women could be assaulted . They said they didn \u2019 t know Ms. Swetnick .\nMr. Avenatti also represents Stephanie Clifford , the former adult-film star whom a lawyer for President Trump paid in October 2016 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump . Mr. Avenatti in recent days has repeatedly called for a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh .\nHours after Mr. Avenatti tweeted the sworn declaration from Ms. Swetnick , Mr. Trump attacked him on Twitter , calling him a \u201c third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations , like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh . \u201d\nWednesday \u2019 s developments did little to shift the views of many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle .\nAt Thursday \u2019 s hearing , veteran sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell will question Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , the woman who has accused him of trying to rape her when they were teenagers . Here \u2019 s what you need to know . Jack Kurtz/Associated Press\nSen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C ) tweeted his skepticism about Ms. Swetnick \u2019 s claims . \u201c I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to\u2014according to the affidavit\u2014ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it , \u201d Mr. Graham wrote .\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the Democratic leader , wrote on Twitter that it would be a \u201c travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country \u201d if the Republicans proceeded with Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination without an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . He called on the judge to withdraw .\nOn Tuesday , Judge Kavanaugh also was asked about two more claims of sexual misconduct , filed anonymously , during an interview with Judiciary Committee staff , according to a transcript released Wednesday .

And Democrats said Wednesday that anonymous charges shouldn \u2019 t be measured the same as those made by women speaking publicly .\nMs. Swetnick graduated from Gaithersburg High School in 1980 , according to a spokeswoman for Montgomery County Public Schools , which would mean she attended the parties described in her declaration after she had graduated .

The company ultimately reached a financial settlement with Ms. Swetnick , the people said .\nA spokesman for New York Life confirmed that Ms. Swetnick worked there as an agent for less than two years , from 2006 to 2008 .
