For months , I \u2019 ve watched Donald Trump decry as \u201c rigged \u201d everything from the Democratic primaries , the Republican primary rules ( that \u2019 s right , the same rules that helped him win the nomination ) and the fall debate schedule . And I \u2019 ve winced as many Bernie Sanders supporters have accused the Democratic National Committee of \u201c rigging \u201d the primaries and thrown around wild , roundly debunked conspiracy theories about deleted votes .\nHere \u2019 s the truth : Washington is rigged , but not in a literal sense and not in any of the nefarious ways those loud voices are contending . Instead , the blame may lie more with voters than politicians : Our legislative process is not designed to withstand the current levels of partisan polarization in the electorate .\nVoters \u2019 vexation with standard-issue , do-nothing D.C. politicians and party elites helps explain the Trump and Sanders phenomena of 2016 , and the \u201c rigging \u201d theories seem to arise out of that frustration and suspicion . Yet much of this anger with \u201c insiders \u201d is misdirected . If only our political problems were due to \u201c rigging \u201d elections , we could arrest someone and get on with it . But our problems are much more structural .\nIn 2012 , my colleague Nate Silver wrote : \u201c Why is compromise so hard in the House ? Some commentators , especially liberals , attribute it to what they say is the irrationality of Republican members of Congress . But the answer could be this instead : Individual members of Congress are responding fairly rationally to their incentives. \u201d That \u2019 s truer than ever : When narrow primary bases dominate elections , everyone loses . And politicians as a whole get blamed .\nSure , many politicians on both the right and left fan the flames of partisan hysteria and feed off their base \u2019 s fire \u2014 and they tend to get disproportionate attention . But in my experience , most candidates and officeholders don \u2019 t see the world as red versus blue : They genuinely run for office to solve problems , not to please special-interest groups or for self-glorification . Unfortunately , they increasingly find themselves trapped in a voter-driven vicious cycle that shows no sign of abating .\n1 . Geographic sorting \u2014 Voters tend to cluster near other people who share their cultural and political values , and the parties \u2019 coalitions have become far more geographically isolated in recent decades . In the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon election , 52 percent of the nation \u2019 s voters lived in states decided by 5 percentage points or less . In the 2012 Obama-Romney race , just 17 percent of all voters lived in such states .\nAs a corollary , there are far fewer truly competitive congressional districts . Just 90 of 435 House districts had a Cook Political Report Partisan Voter Index score , an attempt to measure the partisan lean of an area independent of the candidates on the ballot , between D+5 and R+5 , down 45 percent from 164 in 1998 .\nSure , gerrymandering has played a role in the House , but sorting is the dominant factor : In the impossible-to-gerrymander Senate , the number of seats with a score between D+5 and R+5 has declined from 52 in 1998 to 28 today .\n2 . Straight-ticket voting \u2014 Voters are splitting their tickets \u2014 voting for a Republican for one office and a Democrat for another \u2014 at lower rates than we \u2019 ve seen in decades . They \u2019 re just not making distinctions between parties \u2019 presidential and congressional candidates like they used to . The decline of local news readership probably plays a role \u2014 after all , these outlets have traditionally provided an avenue for candidates to build a personal brand independent of their party \u2019 s .\nIn turn , that \u2019 s further narrowing the trading range of Senate and House seats that are truly up for grabs in November . Even a 53 percent Democratic district or 54 percent Republican district can now be considered a safe seat in most cases . Most races are no longer contests between two candidates with unique backgrounds and qualifications ; more often they are censuses of how many Republicans or Democrats live in a given state or district .\n3 . Primaries have become the new general elections \u2014 The Cook Political Report currently rates just 37 of 435 House seats as competitive this fall , less than 9 percent of the House . As a result , primary elections have become tantamount to general elections in the vast majority of seats . Because primaries are held on many different dates , they tend to generate less national attention and attract disproportionate shares of hardcore , ideological party activists to the polls .\nIn 2014 , only 14.6 percent of eligible voters participated in congressional primaries \u2014 a record low , according to the Center for the Study of the American Electorate . That means a tiny fraction of voters who are the most hardened partisans are essentially electing more than 90 percent of members of Congress . And these low-turnout primaries are often easy prey for ideological interest groups who demand purity .\n4 . Congress grinds to a halt \u2014 The enormous pressure to please narrow , extreme and grossly unrepresentative bases of primary voters has straitjacketed members who would otherwise be willing to collaborate across the aisle , ditch talking points or behave in a way that reflects their true conscience . No one wants to risk alienating their base unnecessarily for fear of becoming the next Eric Cantor .\nOne vehemently anti-Trump GOP member recently confessed to me that the NRCC , his party \u2019 s campaign committee , had pressured him not to declare # NeverTrump until after his state \u2019 s candidate filing deadline had passed , for fear that his stance would generate a primary challenge on the right and jeopardize the seat . My hunch is that some GOP members will be more willing to speak out against their nominee after their primaries pass .\nThe big picture , however , is that the tyranny of primaries has turned Congress into a legislative graveyard . The last two full Congresses , the 112th and 113th , were the two least productive in history . Last week , federal officials confirmed the first local transmission of the Zika virus in Florida , yet Congress is still struggling to pass emergency funding because of partisan squabbling over abortion and environmental regulations .\n5 . Anger at politicians grows \u2014 Every year , legions of candidates take to the airwaves with trite tropes about how \u201c Washington is broken \u201d and how they can fix it , in most cases by just fighting the other party harder . But most candidates end up contributing to the very problem they \u2019 re decrying . When no one gets anything they want and Congress can \u2019 t address basic problems , voters grow even more disillusioned with D.C. and hungrier for an outsider .\nThis has been especially true among Republican primary voters , who hold their own leaders in contempt for having fallen short of overturning President Obama \u2019 s agenda after hearing overzealous campaign promises in 2010 and 2014 . So while Hillary Clinton was barely able to turn back an insurgent in the Democratic primaries , Trump was able to co-opt the entire GOP by capturing 14 million votes from a pool of 220 million eligible U.S. voters .\nHow do we escape this insidious cycle of polarization ? I have no easy solutions . But it might be time for a national conversation about how we can structurally modernize our system of elections to incentivize bipartisanship instead of fringe behavior .
