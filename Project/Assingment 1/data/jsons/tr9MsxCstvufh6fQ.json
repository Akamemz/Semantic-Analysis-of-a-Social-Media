    "content": "ISIS reportedly used chemical weapons against Kurdish forces in Iraq on Wednesday , according to The Wall Street Journal .\nThe attack occurred in northern Iraq , where 60 Peshmerga fighters suffered injuries that appeared to be the result of chemical weapons .\nThe officials said Islamic State could have obtained the mustard agent in Syria , whose government admitted to having large quantities in 2013 when it agreed to give up its chemical-weapons arsenal . The use of mustard agent would mark an upgrade in Islamic State \u2019 s battlefield capabilities , and a worrisome one given U.S. intelligence fears about hidden caches of chemical weapons in Syria , where Islamic State controls wide swaths of territory . It raises new questions about the evolving threat posed by Islamic State and the ability of U.S. allies on the ground to combat it . Frontline Kurdish , Iraqi and moderate Syrian forces say they aren \u2019 t getting enough U.S. support now to counter Islamic State \u2019 s conventional capabilities . Officials say these forces may need specialized equipment and training to help protect them against unconventional weapons if they become a fixture on the battlefield .\nMustard gas was among the chemical weapons banned by the United Nations in 1993 .

Sulfur mustard is generally colorless in its gaseous state , though it may have a faint yellow or green tint .
