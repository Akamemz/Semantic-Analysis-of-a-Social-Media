    "content": "During a Tuesday appearance on the View , no less than the former Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) James Clapper described what was done by the Obama administration to Donald \u2019 s Trump campaign as \u201c spying . \u201d\nAlthough Clapper said he does not like the word \u201c spying \u201d ( considering how the disclosure of this spying has blown up in the Obama administration \u2019 s face , who can blame him ? ) , he still used the word twice \u2014 because there is no other word .\nSounding rattled and defensive , even though he was among friends , Clapper , a left-wing partisan who served as DNI during the Obama administration , attempted to spin the \u201c spying \u201d into something that was for Trump \u2019 s own good and the good of the country .\n\u201c With the informant business , well , the point here is the Russians , \u201d Clapper volunteered . \u201c Not spying on the campaign but what are the Russians doing ? And in a sense , unfortunately , what they were trying to do is protect our political system and protect the campaign . \u201d\nView co-host Joy Behar asked , \u201c Trump \u2026 claims it \u2019 s spying . Other people say it \u2019 s a whistleblower or informant \u2014 he says it \u2019 s spying , it \u2019 s bigger than Watergate . So I ask you , was the FBI spying on Trump \u2019 s campaign ? \u201d\nAgain describing what happened as \u201c spying , \u201d Clapper said the \u201c spying \u201d was done on the Russians , not on the Trump campaign ( as I will explain below , this is simply not true ) .\n\u201c No , they were not , \u201d Clapper replied . \u201c They were spying on , a term I don \u2019 t particularly like , but on what the Russians were doing . Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating , trying to gain access , trying to gain leverage or influence which is what they do . \u201d\nIt is fascinating watching the anti-Trump media attempt to hurl semantics as a means to smear Trump as a liar for calling straight-up spying spying .\nThis social media back-and-forth between Aaron Blake , an anti-Trump activist for the far-left Washington Post , and Fox News \u2019 s Brit Hume , shows you just how foolish the media are willing to look to pretend the Obama administration did not spy on the Trump campaign , even though that is now a proven fact .\nStill no evidence there was a `` SPY .
