    "content": "Barack Obama 's approval rating on handling international affairs has dropped under water for the first time in his presidency in a new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll , a further challenge as he seeks to regain his footing in his second term .\nThe shift is a blow particularly since it directly follows an attempt by Obama to redefine his foreign policy , including a major address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point last week . He 's faced criticism on fronts ranging from Russia 's annexation of Crimea to newfound assertiveness by China , continued civil war in Syria and the challenges of Afghanistan 's future .\nThe reset effort looks unsuccessful so far : At 41 percent , Obama 's approval rating for handling international affairs is down slightly , by 6 points , from early March , and down further , by 13 points , since his re-election , to a career low . Fifty percent disapprove , a new high , with those who strongly disapprove outnumbering strong approvers by 2-1 .\nIn further criticism on the international front , 58 percent say the Obama administration has tried to cover up the facts about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , in 2012 , essentially the same as sentiment on the issue a year ago . Fewer , but still half - 51 percent - favor a fresh round of congressional hearings .\nSome respite may be in the offing : While Obama gets an even 45-45 percent rating on handling one central element of U.S. foreign policy , the situation in Afghanistan , that blossoms to 77 percent support - including 57 percent `` strong '' support - specifically for his plan , announced last week , to remove most U.S. forces there . Even among Republicans and strong conservatives , hardly Obama fans , six in 10 support the drawdown .\nHere at home , further , the president escapes substantial blame for the veterans ' hospitals scandal that forced a Cabinet resignation last week . But his weak ratings on domestic issues , notably the economy and the health care law , continue to damage Obama and his party , and his lost ground on international affairs only adds to his to-do list .\nStill , this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , suggests that Obama 's spring could be worse . Results released yesterday found broad support for proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions , a new initiative of Obama 's . And his job approval overall has ticked up to 46 percent , from a career-low 41 percent in late April . But 51 percent disapprove ; the president has n't seen a net positive approval rating since last July , nearly a year ago .\nDomestic issues dominate public concerns , and here the president 's performance remains more unpopular than popular . Fifty-three percent disapprove of his handling of the economy , vs. 43 percent who approve . Fifty-six percent disapprove of his handling of the implementation of the new health care law , vs. 39 percent approval . And half view his work on immigration negatively , up 9 points in the past year as the issue has bogged down in Congress . Just 38 percent approve .\nAcross these , moreover , intensity of sentiment is sharply against the president , with strong disapproval exceeding strong approval by roughly 2-1 margins .\nOther presidents have done worse . At roughly this point in 2006 , Obama 's predecessor , George W. Bush , had a then career-low 33 percent approval rating overall , 13 points lower than Obama 's today , with 38 percent approval on handling the economy , 34 percent on immigration and 32 percent on the war in Iraq .\n2014 ELECTION/ISSUES - Those comparisons may be cold comfort to Democrats today . In mid-May 2006 , en route to their midterm takeover of the House and Senate , Democratic candidates for Congress led Republicans by 52-40 percent among registered voters . Today the same matchup is an essentially even 47-45 percent , and it 's +2 Republican , 48-46 percent , among those who say they 'll vote for sure .\nNarrowing further , to the likeliest midterm voters , customarily favors the GOP . That means the Democrats , given their usual deficit in turnout , want a substantial lead among registered voters to stave off midterm losses . They 've been nowhere near it since the partial federal government shutdown last fall .\nIssue concerns underscore the Democrats ' challenges and the Republicans ' opportunities . Obama 's ratings are weak both on the top issue that Americans say will inform their midterm vote choices - the economy - and on one of the next-tier issues , the Affordable Care Act .\nAlongside Obamacare are the federal budget deficit and `` the way Washington is working , '' fraught ground for both parties . Others , some of them potentially more helpful to the Democrats , receive lower priorities , including issues of special concern to women , immigration , global warming and gay marriage .\nAll these provide plenty of room for the to-and-fro of the midterms . For example , Obama 's approval rating for handling the economy , while still weak , is 8 points better than his career low , 35 percent in October 2011 , and strong disapproval of his economic performance is 12 points off its peak . Economic progress - or its absence - should prove crucial .\nDivisions among groups , naturally , are of interest as well . The gender gap is wider than it customarily winds up in midterms ; among women , registered voters favor Democrats over Republicans for Congress by a 10-point margin , while among men , it 's Republicans +9 .\nWhites favor GOP candidates by 16 points , with one exception ; college-educated white women provide a continued toehold for Democratic candidates . Nonwhites , for their part , prefer Democrats by 67-23 percent .\nThere 's also the potential influence of the Tea Party political movement . Thirty-nine percent of Americans support the Tea Party , about average in the past three years , including 11 percent who do so strongly . But more are opposed - 46 percent - including 24 percent strongly opposed .\nBy beating back Tea Party candidates in a number of high-profile primaries this season , more traditional Republicans may bolster their chances in the political center . That said , their Democratic opponents may have pushback in suggesting that the GOP 's mainstream has moved in the Tea Party 's direction .\nCome Election Day , though , a central factor is likely to be Obama himself . Among registered voters who approve of his job performance , 81 percent currently favor the Democrat in their congressional district . Among those who disapprove of the president , 72 percent back their local Republican candidate . As goes the president 's popularity , then , so , to a large degree , go his party 's fortunes .\nHEAT OR LIGHT ? - Two specific issues of the day remain wildcards in political terms , with , at least so far , more heat than light in terms of their impact .\nOne is a new congressional investigation focused on the attack that killed a U.S. diplomat and three others in Benghazi . As noted , echoing Republican criticisms , 58 percent think the Obama administration has tried to cover up the facts rather than honestly disclosing what happened ( it was 55 percent a year ago ) . Somewhat fewer , however , either support launching a new investigation , 51 percent , or disapprove of the way then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton handled the issue , 50 percent .\nNext is the scandal over the concealment of long patient wait times at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals : Nearly all , 97 percent , call this a serious issue ( 82 percent , very serious ) , and 65 percent say Eric Shinseki , the secretary of veterans affairs , did the right thing by resigning . At the same time , 60 percent say Obama himself deserves at most only limited blame - `` just some '' or none - for these problems ; 38 percent assign him more blame , but few - 19 percent - give him `` a great deal '' of it .\nOne question that summarizes these competing issues asks Americans whom they trust more to handle the main problems the nation faces - Obama or the Republicans in Congress . A year and half ago , on a roll after his re-election , Obama led in this measure by 15 points . Six months ago that had contracted to an even split , 41-41 percent . Today it 's almost as close - 43 percent for Obama , 38 percent for the Republicans - tight enough to leave control of the political high ground , up to the midterms and beyond , very much up for grabs .\nMETHODOLOGY - This \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone May 29-June 1 , 2014 , in English and Spanish , among a random national sample of 1,002 adults , including landline and cell-phone-only respondents . Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points , including design effect . Partisan divisions are 33-24-35 percent , Democrats-Republicans-independents .\nThe survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York , N.Y. , with sampling , data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York , N.Y .",
