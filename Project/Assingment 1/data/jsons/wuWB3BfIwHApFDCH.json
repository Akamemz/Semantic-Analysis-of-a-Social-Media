Upon entering office , he vowed that North Korea would n't develop an intercontinental ballistic missile on his watch , only to stand by as Kim presided over multiple defiant tests of his new capabilities . Now , some close observers of North Korea say Kim may be using Trump \u2019 s intense focus on his re-election next November as leverage to pressure him into lifting sanctions and striking a deal that favors Pyongyang .\nGiven that Trump has just been impeached , Kim may even view him as even more susceptible to exploitation .\n\u201c Tactically , the election plays a role and the whole impeachment process plays a role , \u201d said Jung Pak , a former senior U.S. intelligence officer now with the Brookings Institution . \u201c Kim probably sees Trump as being hemmed in domestically and more desperate for a deal . \u201d\nThis past week , Stephen Biegun , the U.S. special representative for North Korea , visited U.S. allies Japan and South Korea to assure them of America \u2019 s continued commitment to their safety and to ending Pyongyang \u2019 s nuclear program .\nBiegun also traveled to Beijing to talk to Chinese officials about their role in coaxing Kim to back down .\nWhile in South Korea , Biegun urged North Korea to jump-start negotiations , which have gone nowhere since Trump and Kim held a truncated February summit in Vietnam .\n`` Let 's get this done . We are here and you know how to reach us , '' Biegun said .\nBiegun said the U.S. is well aware of North Korea \u2019 s plans for a \u201c Christmas gift , \u201d which analysts and officials say could range from a space satellite launch to an ICBM test . But Biegun also said the U.S. won \u2019 t put a time limit on negotiations as Kim appears to have done .\n\u201c Let me be absolutely clear : The United States does not have a deadline , \u201d he said .\nBiegun did not manage to secure a session with North Korean officials \u2013 at least not one publicly announced . An East Asian diplomat following the situation said a Biegun-North Korea meeting would have been be a key indicator of progress for the U.S .\n\u201c Beijing and Pyongyang are only a 2-hour flight distance , \u201d the diplomat noted .\nTrump , meanwhile , appears to view Election Day as a pseudo-deadline of his own when it comes to North Korea .

North Korea , under the leadership of Kim Jong Un , has tremendous economic potential , but it must denuclearize as promised . \u201d\nThe tweet \u2013 an extraordinary appeal to an adversary that regularly threatens to incinerate U.S. cities \u2013 didn \u2019 t appear to have the intended effect .

They also said his tweets were \u201c corroboration that he feels fear . \u201d\nThe direct insults were striking because during much of the Trump-Kim romance \u2013 Trump once said the pair \u201c fell in love \u201d \u2013 Kim and his functionaries avoided criticizing the U.S. president himself , even though they were willing to attack some of his aides .\nTrump and Kim have met face-to-face three times : at a historic summit in Singapore in June 2018 ; in Hanoi in February ; and along the North Korean-South Korean border in June .\nWhile the two signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization in Singapore , the relationship stumbled in Vietnam . There , Trump refused to agree to lift numerous U.S. sanctions on North Korea in exchange for what U.S. officials said were limited curbs on its nuclear program . The summit ended early , without a clear plan for the next step . Since then , despite Trump and Biegun \u2019 s appeals , and despite the June meeting , there \u2019 s been little progress .\nNorth Korea has repeatedly warned of a year-end deadline for Trump to offer concessions , presumed to include lifting sanctions . Since May , North Korea has also started once again testing missiles , which it had stopped doing while the Trump-Kim diplomacy was going well .\nTrump has downplayed the recent tests because they involve short-range projectiles that don \u2019 t threaten the continental United States , though they 've alarmed U.S. allies . If North Korea \u2019 s \u201c Christmas gift \u201d turns out to be a long-range missile test or even a nuclear test \u2013 the last one of which it conducted in 2017 \u2013 that would raise pressure on Trump to recalibrate .\n\u201c Trump will be forced to act and act in a strong way , \u201d predicted Joseph Yun , a former U.S. special representative for North Korea Policy .\nTrump and his aides have taken several , norm-shattering steps to end the decades-old , seemingly intractable U.S. conflict with North Korea . That includes having Trump become the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader and the first to set foot on North Korean soil .\nTrump also has cancelled joint military exercises with regional allies , which he often calls \u201c war games , \u201d to help sweeten incentives for Pyongyang to talk .\nJust last month , the Pentagon said the U.S. and South Korea were postponing a joint aerial military exercise in an act of goodwill toward North Korea .
