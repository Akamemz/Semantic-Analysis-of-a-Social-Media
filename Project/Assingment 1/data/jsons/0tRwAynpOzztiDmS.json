    "content": "On Wednesday , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with the feminist students who sued the University of Mary Washington ( UMW ) for failing to protect them from harassment via the anonymous texting app Yik Yak . If it stands , this outcome will imperil free speech on campuses .\n`` Make no mistake , the majority 's novel and unsupported decision will have a profound effect , particularly on institutions of higher education , '' writes Judge Steven Agee in a persuasive dissent . `` Institutions , like the University , will be compelled to venture into an ethereal world of non-university forums at great cost and significant liability , in order to avoid the Catch-22 Title IX liability the majority now proclaims . '' ( Title IX is the federal statute that governs campus sexual misconduct . )\nThe case is the result of a series of disturbing events that took place during the 2014\u20132015 school year at Mary Washington , a public university located in Fredericksburg , Virginia . Members of an activist young group , Feminists United on Campus , alleged that male rugby team members had engaged in sexist chanting . Many people vented their frustration with the feminists using the anonymous texting app Yik Yak ( which has long since ceased to exist ) ; some of these texts were threatening . The April 17 murder of Grace Mann , a member of the group , seemed to confirm that female students were being targeted\u2014though police never found any evidence that the killer , Steven Vander Briel , had sent , or acted on , the Yik Yak threats .\nFeminists United on Campus eventually filed a Title IX complaint against the university alleging that the administration failed to protect students from sexual harassment . In response , UMW President Richard Hurley denied that he possessed either the responsibility or the authority to curb the offensive speech in question .\n`` [ A ] s a public university , UMW is obligated to comply with all federal laws\u2014not just Title IX , '' wrote Hurley . `` The First Amendment prohibits prior restraints on speech , and banning Yik Yak is tantamount to a content-based prohibition on speech .

(Also of note: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is currently taking significant steps to clarify that the scope of Title IX is more limited than what the Obama administration dubiously asserted.) I don't expect this decision to stand; if it did, public universities could face renewed pressure to police sexually suggestive speech on campus.",
