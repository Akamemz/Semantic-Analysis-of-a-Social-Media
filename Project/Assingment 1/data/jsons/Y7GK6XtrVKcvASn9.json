    "content": "The stereotype of a mass shooter is a white male with a history of mental illness or domestic violence . While that may be anecdotally true , the largest single study of mass shooters ever funded by the U.S. government has found that nearly all mass shooters have four specific things in common .\nA new Department of Justice-funded study of all mass shootings \u2014 killings of four or more people in a public place \u2014 since 1966 found that the shooters typically have an experience with childhood trauma , a personal crisis or specific grievance , and a \u201c script \u201d or examples that validate their feelings or provide a roadmap . And then there \u2019 s the fourth thing : access to a firearm .\nThe root cause of mass shootings is an intensely partisan debate , with one side blaming mental health and the others blaming guns . Researchers hope that the findings in the study could usher in a more holistic and evidence-based approach to the issue \u2014 and provide opportunities for policy action .\n\u201c Data is data , \u201d said Jillian Peterson , a psychologist at Hamline University and co-author of the study . \u201c Data isn \u2019 t political . Our hope is that it pushes these conversations further . \u201d\nThe study , compiled by the Violence Project , a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to reducing violence in society , was published Tuesday and is the most comprehensive and detailed database of mass shooters to date , coded to 100 different variables . Its release comes less than a week after a teenage boy killed two students at his high school in Santa Clarita , California , before fatally shooting himself in the head .\nThe researchers used the FBI \u2019 s definition of a \u201c mass murder \u201d \u2014 four or more people killed , excluding the perpetrator \u2014 and applied it to shootings in one public place . The dataset stretches back to August 1 , 1966 , when a former Marine opened fire from an observation deck at the University of Texas , killing 15 people . It wasn \u2019 t the first mass shooting in the U.S. , but researchers chose it as a starting point because it was the first to be substantively covered on radio and TV .\nThe database delivers a number of arresting findings . Mass shootings are becoming much more frequent and deadly : Of the 167 incidents the researchers logged in that 53-year period , 20 % have occurred in the last five years , and half since 2000 .\nThey \u2019 re also increasingly motivated by racial , religious , or misogynist hatred , particularly the ones that occurred in the past five years .\nAnd in an era when tightening gun laws , including background checks , is a national political issue , the study found that more than half of all mass shooters in the database obtained their guns legally .\nBut researchers said they were particularly struck by how many mass shooters displayed symptoms of being in some sort of crisis prior to the shooting . \u201c Those are opportunities for prevention , \u201d said Peterson .\nExperts have long cautioned that there is no single profile for a mass shooter . But the Violence Project researchers found some personal characteristics often align with certain types of locations targeted by shooters , and created five general categories :\nK-12 shooters : White males , typically students or former students of the school , with a history of trauma . Most are suicidal , plan their crime extensively , and make others aware of their plans at some point before the shooting . They use multiple guns that they typically steal from a family member .\nCollege and university shooters : Non-white males who are current students of the university , are suicidal , and have a history of violence and childhood trauma . They typically use legally obtained handguns and leave behind some sort of manifesto .\nWorkplace shooters : Fortysomething males without a specific racial profile . Most are employees of their targeted location , often a blue-collar job site , and have some grievance against the workplace . They use legally purchased handguns and assault rifles .\nPlace of worship shooters : White males in their 40s , typically motivated by hate or domestic violence that spills out into public . Their crimes typically involve little planning .\nShooters at a commercial location ( such as a store or restaurant ) : White men in their 30s with a violent history and criminal record . They typically have no connection to the targeted location and use a single , legally obtained firearm . About a third show evidence of a \u201c thought disorder , \u201d a term for a mental health condition , like schizophrenia , that results in disorganized thinking , paranoia , or delusions .\nThe study shows that the number of shooters who are motivated by racism , religious hate , and misogyny have increased since the 1960s \u2014 most dramatically in the last five years .\nSince 2015 , hate-fueled shootings targeting black churchgoers in Charleston , Jews at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway , women at a yoga studio in Tallahassee , and Latinos at a Walmart in El Paso , have dominated national headlines and added another layer of complexity to the problem of mass violence in America .\nREAD : A Marine used a neo-Nazi site to recruit for a `` racial holy war . ''\nBetween 1966 and 2000 , there were 75 mass shootings . Of those , 9 % were motivated by racism , 1 % by religious hatred , and 7 % by misogyny . Of the 32 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. just since 2015 , 18 % were motivated by racism , 15 % by religious hatred , and 21 % by misogyny .\nThe increase in ideologically motivated mass shootings has coincided with the emergence of a newly emboldened far right , who \u2019 ve forged national and even international alliances of hate online . The sharp rise in misogyny-inspired shootings also squares with the rise of the \u201c Incels , \u201d short for \u201c involuntarily celibate , \u201d an online subculture comprised of angry young men who deeply resent and blame women for their isolation .\nMental health is a factor \u2014 but rarely the cause\nTwo-thirds of the mass shooters in the database had a documented history of mental health problems . While this seems high , researchers point out that roughly 50 % of Americans have experienced some kind of mental health problem at some point in their lives .\nMoreover , the percentage of shooters whose crimes were directly motivated by the symptoms of a mental disorder ( such as delusions or hallucinations caused by psychosis ) is much smaller : roughly 16 % . That is a smaller percentage than shooters motivated by hate , a workplace grievance , or an interpersonal conflict .\n\u201c If someone has a mental health history , I think we \u2019 ve gotten in the habit of blaming that for their actions , \u201d said Peterson . \u201c But someone can have , say , depression , and it \u2019 s not like everything they do is driven by that . \u201d\nREAD : Trump blamed `` mentally ill monsters '' for Dayton and El Paso massacres .\nThat said , the study found strong links between suicidal motivations and mass shootings .
