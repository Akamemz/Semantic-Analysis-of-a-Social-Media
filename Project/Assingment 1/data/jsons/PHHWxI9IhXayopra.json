But Favreau had already given himself away . In retrospect , the tweet is even more telling and confirms that knowledge of the spying was widespread at Obama \u2019 s White House .

We are back in the denial phase . But at the height of the hysteria after Trump \u2019 s election and inauguration , members of the Obama administration wanted everyone to know they had been spying on Trump and feared that he would destroy their \u201c intelligence. \u201d They leaked to the New York Times in March 2017 that they had \u201c scrambled \u201d to preserve the supposed damning results of their spying , in order to leave a \u201c clear trail of intelligence for government investigators . \u201d\nBy \u201c intelligence , \u201d they meant their own feverishly partisan sifting through negligible , half-cocked leads . Had there been any substance to their \u201c intelligence , \u201d they would have leaked it out . Having failed , they still thought they deserved an A for effort . They also saw the future political benefits of sliming Trump with innuendo , striking a posture that can be summed up as : Trust us , you guys , what we have found is really bad , but we can \u2019 t tell you yet . They couldn \u2019 t tell us because they had nothing to tell , but they needed to leave the impression of yet-to-be-disclosed dirt in order to trigger the Mueller investigation , and thanks to the recusal of Jeff Sessions they pulled it off .\nApologists for the Obama administration \u2019 s spying are still playing this game , wallowing in what they would have once called unconscionable McCarthyism . They make sinister references to \u201c intelligence , \u201d never tell us what it is , and then paper over the nothingness with blather about the \u201c depth \u201d of this or that person \u2019 s \u201c concern. \u201d Christopher Steele was \u201c worried , \u201d John Brennan was \u201c worried , \u201d and so on . Who cares ? Where is the evidence ?\nSo far the \u201c evidence \u201d justifying the Obama administration \u2019 s spying on the Trump campaign has been stunning in its simpleminded crudity . The \u201c evidence \u201d includes : candidate Trump didn \u2019 t condemn Putin enough , Trump once jokingly told Russia to look for Hillary \u2019 s deleted emails , the RNC strengthened ( but not sufficiently so to the satisfaction of the media ) a Russian plank in its platform , Stefan Halper saw Michael Flynn talking to a Russian woman at Cambridge back in 2014 , Carter Page gave a speech in Moscow , Russian government officials were overheard talking about the Trump campaign ( this is non-evidence hyped as worrisome \u201c signals intelligence \u201d that is common about any presidential campaign ) , and an Australian diplomat had a chat at a London bar with a Trump campaign volunteer who said something speculative that anybody reading the newspaper could have also ventured .\nIs the threshold for something as significant as spying on an opposing presidential campaign really this low ? The answer is yes , if those with the power to start the probe are partisans in the grip of Trump Derangement Syndrome . The capacity of John Brennan and Jim Comey to believe the worst about Trump lies at the root of this debacle and explains why they would treat his campaign as a criminal enterprise to be infiltrated .\nIn recent days , the chattering class has tried out the feeble , question-begging cry : Well , what were they supposed to do ? Ignore this \u201c troubling information \u201d ? It is hilarious to watch Philip Agee-quoting ACLU donors and former cheerleaders of the Church committee suddenly turn into the most paranoid , gung-ho institutionalists , for whom every government investigation , no matter how flimsy its foundation , deserves a robust defense . My gosh , they say , we are talking about \u201c suspected Russian agents \u201d ! How could you not shadow them ? Never mind that the FBI so far is 0 for 4 ; never mind that the FBI didn \u2019 t have anything close to a justification for placing Page , Papadopoulos , Manafort , and Flynn in the category of probable Russian agents .\nJust as a basketball player who fouls his way into the key and then misses the dunk doesn \u2019 t want anyone to see a replay of the game , so the Obama administration doesn \u2019 t want the public to see the tape , as it were , of how it sought FISA warrants based on Hillary \u2019 s campaign smears , ran a spy into the Trump \u2019 s campaign ranks , and still came up empty .
