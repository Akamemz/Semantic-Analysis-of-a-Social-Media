He has conducted his Cabinet search out in the open , like a casting call for \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d as applicants ( and well-wishers ) come and go through the lobby of Trump Tower . And he will keep having big rallies , starting Thursday in Cincinnati , as he launches a \u201c thank you \u201d tour of battleground states .\nAt the same time , Trump is also behaving as a conventional Republican . He has named GOP establishment figures to top posts \u2013 starting with national party chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff , and continuing with South Carolina Gov .

Tom Price as Health and Human Services secretary , and former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao as Transportation secretary .\nIn so doing , Trump has reassured GOP regulars and consolidated the party behind him . Trump \u2019 s conventional early Cabinet picks took on added significance following two controversial appointments : Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as chief strategist and Michael Flynn as national security adviser .\nBut Trump \u2019 s maverick , populist side remains supremely important : It helps keep his voters with him , including disaffected , working-class Democrats and first-time voters inspired by Trump \u2019 s promise to \u201c make America great again. \u201d The election of 2016 was a cry for change , and just by winning , the billionaire businessman/political novice has broken the mold .
