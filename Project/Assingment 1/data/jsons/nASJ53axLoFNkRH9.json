    "content": "One of the most seductive parts of President Barack Obama 's political message ( and the message of progressive Democrats in general ) is sympathy for the poor and a willingness to talk about the disparities of capitalism -- about the rich being too rich and the poor being screwed . In some ways , it 's the predominant message of the Obama era .\nAnd though it 's reasonable to contend that Republicans need to display more compassion -- if for nothing else than their own political survival -- is n't it also reasonable to take stock of how things have gone for the poor under four-plus years of progressive rule ?\nNow , if you 're heavily invested in the market , life is peachy . A confounding fact , no doubt , when one considers that nearly every economic indicator known to mankind has been pretty abysmal of late . We are experiencing high unemployment , a shrinking labor force , stagnant gross domestic product growth and rickety consumer confidence . A disconnected market , though , has been on a historic boom . So if we need any more proof that life really is n't fair , think about this : The rich have the Federal Reserve , and you have Harry Reid .\nWhat does it mean in substance ? According to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data , thanks to a robust stock and bond market , coupled with a lousy housing market , the recovery has meant that households with a net worth in the upper 7 percent have seen their net worth rise , on average , by nearly 30 percent in the years after the recession and that everyone else 's net worth has dropped by an average of 4 percent .\nThe economic gap between whites and minorities is even worse . According to the Urban Institute , whites , on average , have two times the income of blacks and Hispanics and six times the wealth , and that gap is accelerating .\nThis is going on , if you can imagine , even after a tax hike on the wealthy .\nThe left 's answer to this accelerating disparity under Obama will , no doubt , be more regulatory burdens , more tax hikes ( the president is still obsessed with closing loopholes on private jets -- a rounding error , in his budget ) , more deficit spending and more programs that smooth over all the unjust vagaries of life . Most often , these solutions erect barriers to mobility for small businesses and entrepreneurs -- the types of people who help alter the dynamics of mobility . Despite what you may hear , more revenue for government does n't create wealth . A freer economy and more societal stability do .\nIf Americans believe that government should promote opportunity and mobility and not equality of outcomes , as this administration claims , allowing more economic freedom would not leave us hapless in the face of unregulated anarchy . It would do the opposite . It would invite more innovation and more opportunity .\nOr forget policy . Maybe this is a moral question . Maybe it 's a question of leadership . You may believe that government has no business telling us how to lead our lives . I would agree . But if the president were really concerned about inequality , rather than praising abortion mills , he might want to speak out on the importance of families , which , whether we like it or not , are one of the leading indicators of personal prosperity . He might want to speak out about the immorality of a welfare state that helps destroy those families .\nBecause really , what policy passed or proposed by Democrats over the past four years has started or would start fixing the income disparity in any substantive way ?
