Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate , solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP 's establishment . He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23 . `` These are all of our stories , '' Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia . `` These are who we are as Americans . And yet for so many Americans , the promise of America seems more and more distant . ''\nBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination . This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House . `` So , ladies and gentlemen , I am officially running for president of the United States , and we are going to make our country great again , '' Trump told the crowd at his announcement .\nClinton reveled in her win , which broke Bernie Sanders ' string of successes in the West and Midwest .\nThe victories pushed both candidates much closer to their parties ' nominations , leaving their opponents no room for error if either is to be stopped .\nThe Queens-born businessman put weeks of negative headlines -- from staff changes to delegate losses to abortion flip-flops -- behind him by crushing Ted Cruz and John Kasich in his home state .

MUST WATCH Trump wins big in New York 01:16\nOn stage at Trump Tower , the Republican front-runner surrounded himself with some of his high-profile business friends to cap what he called `` an amazing week .

''\nTrump , facing a Cruz campaign adept at the inside baseball of delegate-counting , on Tuesday accused the Republican Party of trying to `` take the election away '' from him . He touted the delegates he would capture in New York , emphasizing he won them in a primary election where voters went to the polls -- an un-subtle dig at Cruz , who has done better in caucuses or party conventions . `` The people are n't going to stand for it . It 's a crooked system . It 's a system that 's rigged , '' Trump told the cheering crowd at Trump Tower .\nThe good news for Trump should n't stop . April 26 -- the next Super Tuesday \u2014 features Maryland , Pennsylvania and other northeastern states that should also be friendly to the front-runner .\nIt 's a sure sign that Clinton is expecting to celebrate when her campaign announces she 'll deliver a speech on the night of a big election .\nIt 's also a win that makes it much harder for Sanders to ever catch Clinton . In a nod to his supporters , whom Clinton would need if she wins the nomination , Clinton said at her victory party : `` To all the people who supported Senator Sanders , I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us .

Exit polls showed Clinton performed better than usual among voters ages 30-49 ( though Sanders trounced her again with those 18-29 ) , and kept her advantages among minorities , women and older voters . Sanders , meanwhile , still outperformed Clinton with younger voters , men and whites .\nThose advantages have been enough for Clinton so far -- and they do n't bode well for Sanders in states like New Jersey and California , where he 'd need to crush Clinton to have any chance of catching her in pledged delegates .\nSanders hoped he 'd win New York . In fact , as a pro-Clinton group gleefully pointed out Tuesday , he 'd said at least 27 times that he expected to win . For two weeks he 'd practically moved back to his hometown of Brooklyn .\nBut Sanders lost big . He congratulated Clinton for her win , but he also was quick to blame the system . New York 's primary is closed -- which means only registered Democrats can participate , limiting Sanders ' ability to turn out the many independent voters who have helped him win other states .\nThe closed primary , Sanders said Tuesday evening in Pennsylvania as the crowd booed New York 's laws , is `` wrong . ''\n`` That has got to change in future elections , '' he said .\nSanders , though , will face the same problem next Tuesday , when Pennsylvania , Maryland , Connecticut , Delaware and Rhode Island vote .

There , 126,000 voters were dropped from the registration list since last fall . His supporters were active on social media Tuesday pointing to both the closed primary and the Brooklyn woes as evidence the contest was unfair .\nThe Sanders camp 's eagerness to dismiss New York 's results come as tensions flare between the two campaigns . Clinton 's aides are furious with Sanders ' allegations that she is violating campaign finance rules through her joint fundraising account with the Democratic National Committee -- worried it will do long-term damage to the party 's brand and play into Trump 's casting of Clinton as `` Crooked Hillary . '' Sanders , meanwhile , unloaded on Clinton over paid speeches , Wall Street contributions and trade in a speech in Pennsylvania .\nStill , he has n't addressed the fundamental weakness of his campaign : an inability to win black voters , CNN political commentator Van Jones notes . He pulled out all the stops in New York , leaning on former NAACP head Ben Jealous , releasing an ad by Spike Lee that featured Harry Belafonte , Rosario Dawson and Danny Glover , and leaning on alliances with the Working Families Party and the Transit Workers Union , both with strong black ties .\nIf Sanders could n't improve his performance with African-Americans in New York , it 's not clear that he ever will .\nTurns out bashing `` New York values '' is n't the way to make friends and influence people who vote in the New York primary .\nIn Philadelphia on Tuesday night , Cruz spoke before New York 's polls closed \u2014 sparing him , for the moment , the awkwardness of addressing his third-place finish and his zero delegate haul .\nJUST WATCHED New Yorkers on Ted Cruz and 'New York values ' Replay More Videos ...

He 'd already campaigned in Maryland on Monday , and is fighting for conservatives in a district-by-district bid to deny Trump delegates .\nEverything Cruz did on Tuesday night -- from the location of his event to the 8:30 p.m . ET timing -- reinforced that he was n't holding his breath for a good night in New York . Aides said if he could hold Trump under 90 of the state 's 95 delegates , even that would count as an acceptable result .\nKasich 's strategy of eating just about everything in sight -- pizza with a fork at Gino 's Pizzeria , soup , a pickle and apple strudel at PJ Bernstein Deli , a massive sub at Mike 's Deli -- helped him to a distant second-place finish , but did earn him a few delegates , denying Trump a clean sweep of his home state .\nJUST WATCHED Kasich eats New York pizza with a fork Replay More Videos ...

''\nThe Democratic contest has become increasingly heated and personal in recent days -- but even as Sanders amps up the attacks and Clinton 's campaign frets over the potential impact , the party 's primary voters do n't seem worried .\nSixty-seven percent of Democratic voters surveyed in early exit polls said the campaign between Sanders and Clinton has energized the party , while just 29 % said it has divided the party .\nIn the short term , the extended primary is frustrating Clinton 's camp . Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri called Sanders ' campaign `` destructive '' to the point that Sanders ' continuation in the race is `` not productive to Democrats '' and `` not productive for the country . ''\nBut in the long run , Democratic voters ' engagement and interest in the contest could help Clinton , who will need to consolidate Sanders ' supporters if she clinches the nomination -- and could find it easier to do that if they 're not turned off by an extended intra-party battle .\nSixty percent say the GOP campaign has divided the party , compared to 36 % who say it has energized it .\nThat could have something to do with the state 's leading candidate , Trump , consistently declaring the nominating process `` rigged '' against him .\nThe numbers show that Republicans could have the tougher challenge in bringing the party together behind its eventual nominee .\nTrump 's Tuesday rout punctuated that reality . His victory made clear that no other Republican stands a chance of catching him at the polls -- even as party members fight to deny him delegates .",
