Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , fellow Midwesterner , is also drawing larger , more enthusiastic crowds . \u201c We need to build a blue wall around those states ... and make Donald Trump pay for it , \u201d says Senator Klobuchar , who won reelection last year in 42 counties that went for Mr. Trump .\n\u201c I \u2019 m more worried about [ finding ] the candidate that can beat Donald Trump than policy , \u201d says John Keenan , a father in Concord , standing with his young daughter outside the Statehouse , waiting for Joe Biden to emerge . Though former Vice President Biden has been the go-to centrist candidate , Mr. Keenan is leaning toward Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Indiana .\nProgressives are coming under greater scrutiny . Even liberal voters who love Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s bold ideas like \u201c Medicare for All \u201d are questioning whether she can really win \u2013 especially in the heartland . The last thing they want is for Mr. Trump to eke out another Electoral College victory . For that , they \u2019 re willing to compromise on issues they care about .\nWho can beat Donald Trump ? For many voters turning up at Democratic events in New Hampshire , that \u2019 s the No . 1 question on their mind .\nAs the New Hampshire primary draws closer , and average voters start coming out to hear the presidential candidates in person , there \u2019 s a common refrain at Democratic events : We want someone who can beat President Donald Trump \u2013 and not just in coastal states like ours .\nEven some avowed progressives are expressing concern that , as much as they love Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s calls for systemic change , programs like \u201c Medicare for All \u201d might be more than fellow voters across the nation can swallow , especially in the heartland .\nThat may explain an uptick of interest in Midwestern candidates like South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , as well as the last-minute entry of former Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick and the possible bid by a centrist like Michael Bloomberg . Despite the unusually large Democratic field , what \u2019 s emerging is a deepening sense that beating Mr. Trump will be no cakewalk .\nA recent New York Times poll indicated that among the front-runners , only former Vice President Joe Biden would beat Mr. Trump in a majority of Midwestern battleground states \u2013 and only barely .\n\u201c We need to build a blue wall around those states ... and make Donald Trump pay for it , \u201d Senator Klobuchar told a theater full of voters in Rochester , New Hampshire , so packed at lunchtime on a weekday that more than a few people had to stand . To do that , she emphasized , the nominee must reach out not only to Midwestern Democrats but also to independents and \u201c Republicans of conscience . \u201d\nElise Amendola/AP Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks outside the Statehouse in Concord , New Hampshire , after filing to be placed on the 2020 New Hampshire primary ballot , on Oct. 30 , 2019 .\nThat message has won the support of Patrick Quinn , a Republican who credits President Trump \u2019 s tax cut with dramatically improving his income as a travel nurse but calls the president himself \u201c vile . \u201d\n\u201c For the first time ever , I started looking at Democratic candidates , \u201d says Mr. Quinn , who paid $ 45 for a ticket to a recent Democratic gala in southern New Hampshire headlined by Senator Klobuchar . By the end of the night , he was sold on her \u2013 despite his friends \u2019 reactions on Facebook . \u201c I \u2019 m happy to donate to her campaign , support her in any way that I can . \u201d\nIn particular , Mr. Quinn , who still plans to vote for Republicans in every race other than the presidential contest , says he \u2019 s impressed with the Minnesota senator \u2019 s bipartisan record . She has passed more than 100 bills as the lead Democrat and was the primary sponsor of a third of those , compared with a handful for senators like Bernie Sanders and Ms. Warren .\nThat no doubt contributed to her winning 42 counties in 2018 that had gone for Mr. Trump just two years prior . And what about in a face-off ? A recent poll shows her beating the president by 17 points in the state .\n\u201c The heartland is not flyover country to me , \u201d Ms. Klobuchar told a packed audience at a retirement community in Exeter , New Hampshire , earlier that day . Demonstrating how she would spar with Mr. Trump on a debate stage , she added , \u201c I don \u2019 t think about these farmers and workers in the middle of the country as poker chips in a bankrupt casino like you do , as you bankrupt the country \u2013 they are my neighbors and friends . \u201d\nThe go-to candidate for centrist voters all along has been Mr. Biden , a Roman Catholic who comes from a blue-collar family in Scranton , Pennsylvania , and is seen as having a more natural appeal to some of the white working-class voters who ditched the Democrats for Mr. Trump in 2016 .\nCharles Krupa/AP Democratic presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick files to have his name listed on the New Hampshire primary ballot , on Nov. 14 , 2019 , in Concord , New Hampshire .\nWhen he arrives at the New Hampshire capitol to officially file his papers for the Feb. 11 primary , the narrow hallways are packed with firefighters and other supporters chanting his name . \u201c J-O-E for 6-0-3 , \u201d they yell , referring to the state \u2019 s area code . As the former vice president walks with his wife past gilded portraits depicting New Hampshire statesmen , young staffers beat on upside-down plastic buckets hastily painted the day before , leaving a trail of blue paint chips behind them .\nOutside , a modest crowd assembles in the frigid weather , awaiting Mr. Biden \u2019 s exit . They include voters who have just put the schedule of candidate visits on their fridge and are coming out for the first time , as well as people like John Keenan , who saw the crowd and stopped to see what it was about .\n\u201c I \u2019 m more worried about [ finding ] the candidate that can beat Donald Trump than policy , \u201d says Mr. Keenan , who was shopping with his daughter to replace her pink Converse low-tops . He says he likes Mr. Biden but also Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Warren \u2013 and adds that he knows it will take someone really strong to beat the president . \u201c When [ Mr. Biden ] is under the gun , he \u2019 s not as quick as he could be . \u201d\nOthers dismiss the idea that Mr. Biden is too old or should pass the baton to a new generation , noting that he would be able to enter the White House on Day One knowing how to run it , and could leverage his many relationships with world leaders to repair America \u2019 s alliances .\n\u201c What better way to pass the baton than to right the ship and then pass it on to the next generation ? \u201d says Chris , a New Hampshire voter who didn \u2019 t want to give his last name because he is a federal employee .\n\u201c The character of our nation is on the ballot , \u201d Mr. Biden said when he took to the stage before a modest crowd that had braved snow squalls on a frigid Friday afternoon . He indirectly addressed the president \u2019 s criticism around his and his son \u2019 s involvement in Ukraine . \u201c I \u2019 ve learned two things the last several weeks : One is that Vladimir Putin doesn \u2019 t want me to be president , \u201d he says . The other \u2013 \u201c that Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t want me to be the nominee . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s scared of you ! \u201d shouts one woman amid more drumming and cheers .\nIn a five-minute speech , Mr. Biden presents himself as the only one who can bring the country together and make progress on key issues like health care , while still respecting Americans \u2019 freedom to choose for themselves .\nMr. Biden is the only candidate who has a chance of beating Mr. Trump , says Dianetta Gilmore of Brooklyn , New York , when he finishes , pushing a cart of Biden buttons toward a line of protesters on the sidewalk with Medicare for All signs .

While some back that theory , others argue that it would be better to find a moderate candidate who can woo back former Obama supporters who went for Mr. Trump , win over disaffected Republicans , and help the country heal .\nMr. Buttigieg , the 38-year-old gay Harvard grad and Navy reservist , tells voters they don \u2019 t have to settle for one or the other .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t let anybody tell you that we \u2019 re going to have to choose \u2013 either solve the problems , or everyone is going to be united but we can \u2019 t get anything done . That \u2019 s not an acceptable choice , \u201d he said , adding that the nation needs a president \u201c who can stand on the rubble of what has been busted in our society and in our politics , pick up the pieces , implement bold solutions to get something done about those issues , and find a way to do it that \u2019 s actually going to unify the American people . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
