    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) A House panel approved a measure Wednesday that cuts funding for Amtrak , less than a day after a train derailment left at least seven people dead and many more injured .\nThe Republican-led House Appropriations Committee voted 30-21 to reduce grants to Amtrak by $ 252 million -- a drop of about 15 % from last year 's level . The cut would apply only to Amtrak 's capital spending and would n't touch funding levels for safety and operations . The measure still needs to clear the full House and Senate before it would go into effect in October .\nDemocrats on the panel fought unsuccessfully to boost Amtrak funding by $ 1 billion , to $ 2.4 billion . But Republicans argued that such a spending increase would need to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget , and they admonished Democrats for pointing to the derailment in an effort to increase funding for the passenger rail service .\n`` Do n't use this tragedy in that way .
