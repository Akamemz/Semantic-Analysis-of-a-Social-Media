    "content": "During a tense phone call with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough in early March , Sen. Chuck Schumer delivered a blunt message : He would join a growing chorus of senators defying the wishes of President Barack Obama by demanding that Congress have an official say over any nuclear deal with Iran .\nBut in a nod to the president , Schumer later made clear that he would give administration officials more time to negotiate a nuclear pact before pushing forward with a congressional review bill .\nThe conversations underscored the unusually conflicted \u2014 yet increasingly influential \u2014 role Schumer is playing as the Iran talks approach a critical juncture . The New York Democrat was already among a handful of senators with the power to undermine or even scuttle a nuclear agreement . Then on Friday , he became the Democratic leader-in-waiting following Sen. Harry Reid \u2019 s retirement announcement .\nNow senators on both sides of the aisle will be watching Schumer \u2014 closely \u2014 to see how he responds to any deal .\nAs a leading pro-Israel voice among Senate Democrats , Schumer is at odds with the White House on Iran , yet he also needs to maintain good relations with Obama . He has to balance his own views on the negotiations with those of a Senate Democratic Caucus that is , by and large , eager to avoid conflict with Iran and stand with the president . Further complicating the matter is a home-state constituency with very strong feelings about Israel and the threat posed to it by Iran .\n\u201c It \u2019 s obvious that he has a very real , pro-Israel constituency , \u201d said Sen. John McCain , the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman and a friend of Schumer \u2019 s . \u201c Yet at the same time , he has loyalty to the president . So he has to balance those . \u201d\nIndeed , the Iran deal is a key early test for the New Yorker as he works to solidify his standing as Reid \u2019 s heir apparent . Schumer has long been reluctant to take assertive positions when his caucus is divided . But the prominent Jewish Democrat \u2014 he will be the first person of his faith to serve as a Senate party leader \u2014 may have to if a deal is clinched and faces a backlash from the powerful pro-Israel lobby .\nSchumer is widely seen as a barometer of whether the White House will have enough support on Capitol Hill to sustain a veto on a bill by Sens . Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) and Robert Menendez ( D-N.J. ) requiring that Congress review any Iran agreement . The view is that if Schumer pushes hard for the Corker-Menendez plan , it will almost certainly clear the 67 votes needed to override a veto , since having him publicly call for the proposal gives other Democrats the political cover to break with Obama on the issue .\nAdding to his role is the likelihood that Menendez will be indicted soon on federal corruption charges , potentially sidelining him in the debate . The New Jersey senator is the other leading Democratic hawk defending Israel .\n\u201c Schumer has played a pretty pivotal role in making sure we keep our unity in the Senate , \u201d said Sen.
