    "content": "It 's been one year since Rush Limbaugh 's invective-filled tirade against then-Georgetown Law student Sandra Fluke . With hundreds of advertisers and millions of dollars lost , the business of right-wing radio is suffering , but Rush Limbaugh continues to act as if it were business as usual , which is why Limbaugh is still bad for business .\nOn February 29 , 2012 , Rush Limbaugh initiated a three-day smear campaign against Sandra Fluke , launching 46 personal attacks against her . This moment and Limbaugh 's subsequent refusal to apologize for , or even acknowledge , all but two of those attacks put the spotlight on the right-wing talk business model that Limbaugh helped construct .\nDuring the following weeks , headlines tracked in near real-time the names of advertisers exiting Limbaugh 's show as pundits and natterers speculated about Limbaugh 's future . As so often happens , the buzz faded and the news cycle rolled on . But the consequences did n't fade , they intensified . This is due in large part to scores of independent organizers , like the Flush Rush and the # StopRush community .\nRush Limbaugh 's recklessness damaged the radio industry and the business of conservative talk .\nWhen advertisers began fleeing from his program , Limbaugh dismissed the losses as akin to losing a \u201c couple of French fries \u201d and insisted that \u201c nobody is losing any money here. \u201d This position seemed less tenable after Limbaugh employed the services of a crisis manager to handle the fallout , and the right-wing talker 's protestations were proven false once financial reports started rolling in .\nFor example , Cumulus Media , a radio company that carries Limbaugh 's show in 38 markets , reported millions of dollars in lost revenue and attributed the losses in part to the Limbaugh advertiser fallout . Dial Global , a radio syndication company , reported roughly $ 100 million in losses for 2012 and publicly cited Limbaugh as a significant contributing factor .\nOwing to the structure of radio advertising , the losses Limbaugh felt rippled outward , intensifying their effect . Reports indicate that 70 percent of advertisers did n't know their ads were running during Limbaugh 's show . From my own extensive conversations with advertisers , I would say that more than half were not aware that their ads were running during Limbaugh 's show . That may seem unlikely , but it 's quite possible after you consider how the ads got there in the first place .\nAdvertisers pay media buyers to negotiate rates and coordinate ad buys with radio companies . Typically they 're just buying a certain number of commercials during a defined period of time . Consequently , the advertiser is often several steps removed from the actual ad placement . Once notified that their ads are running during his program , advertisers often immediately recognize that they should n't be supporting Limbaugh . They contact their buyer to request that the ads be removed and instruct them to exclude Limbaugh from future ad buys . After a few of their clients request the same thing , savvy buyers get the message . They start proactively excluding clients from Limbaugh 's show . Many go a step further and exclude their clients ' ads from programming similar to Limbaugh 's , which amplifies the negative impact on right-wing radio .\nRadio companies are still not equipped to respond to these kinds of client requests , which creates additional problems . The increased frequency of ads being run in error frustrates advertisers and strains relationships with the buying agencies . The Limbaugh advertiser problem is so significant that it has even spilled over into the business of online radio streams , according to Erica Farber , who is CEO of the Radio Association of Broadcasters .\nAt a Talkers forum last year , Norm Pattiz , CEO of Courtside Entertainment , summed up the destructive effect Limbaugh has had on the entire industry , noting that a \u201c tremendous chunk of advertising revenue was wiped out in terms of support for national talk radio programs. \u201d Pattiz added that \u201c the movement in talk radio to some degree is moving away from conservative talk radio and into other genres . \u201d\nDespite continued rebukes by advertisers , and seemingly without regard for the damage he is causing , Rush Limbaugh adds to the problem by proceeding as if it were business as usual .\nEvery day , Rush Limbaugh reminds advertisers why they should be wary about associating with right-wing radio by filling his airtime with the same kinds of bigotry , deceit , and chicanery that have come to define his brand .\nLast July , Limbaugh argued that feminism is \u201c ruining women \u201d and asserted that feminism was established so that \u201c unattractive women \u201d could have \u201c easier access to the mainstream. \u201d In September , Limbaugh warned that men 's penises are shrinking and blamed \u201c feminazis \u201d and \u201c chickification . \u201d\nLast month , Limbaugh inexplicably claimed \u201c African-Americans today can be convinced that they are still slaves. \u201d He also launched a series of slavery-based attacks on Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee , wondering if Jackson Lee had \u201c outlived her usefulness on the plantation . \u201d\nIn December , he asked a caller : \u201c You 're a woman and you like the Super Bowl ? Or , is that when your husband beats you ? \u201d Last month , he told another caller : \u201c You know how to stop abortion ?
