Expecting a crowd -- of mostly media and friends , or their `` chosen family , '' as many of their kin do n't approve of their relationship -- they awoke at 5 a.m. Monday to get dressed `` so that when we got out of the tent we 'd look like a million bucks , '' Sisson said .\nSisson , 24 , and Wolfe , 21 , have known each other for seven years . They 've been dating for two .
