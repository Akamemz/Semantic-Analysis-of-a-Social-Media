The Republican presidential nominee 's campaign is in chaos , fending off allegations from four separate women -- all going public on the same day , `` coincidentally '' -- that he fondled , kissed , or groped them without their consent . The alleged incidents date as far back as the 1980 's , through as recently as 2013 . None of these women went to the authorities at the time , but all have friends or family who confirm that they reported the episodes contemporaneously . Matt told you about the New York Times report last night . As those accusations entered the media bloodstream , more pieces dropped . A Yahoo ! News story links to a Facebook post from a 2013 Miss Universe contestant who describes Trump 's degrading treatment of the women in the pageant , later commenting that Trump `` continually grabbed my ass '' during the process . She is daring Trump to sue her , saying that she has `` worse stories '' she could share . Separately , here 's a Florida allegation via the Palm Beach Post :\nFor more than 10 years , it was something Mindy McGillivray said she shared only with a close circle of family and friends . That changed Sunday night . Donald Trump was asked during the presidential debate about when he bragged that he kissed women without their consent and grabbed their genitals \u2013 remarks captured on audio that surfaced last week . Trump apologized for the remarks and dismissed them as \u201c locker room talk. \u201d But the debate moderator , CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper , asked Trump to clarify : \u201c Have you ever done those things ? \u201d \u201c No , I have not , '' Trump replied . Watching at home in Palm Springs , McGillivray said she rose from her couch and yelled at the TV screen : \u2018 You liar ! \u2019 McGillivray , 36 , said she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago 13 years ago . She said she never reported it to authorities .
