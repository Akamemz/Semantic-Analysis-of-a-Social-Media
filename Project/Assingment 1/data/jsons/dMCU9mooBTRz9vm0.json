Earlier , House leaders abruptly canceled a planned vote on a package meant to address the surge of illegal immigrant minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border , with a combination of funding and policy changes , after failing to gather enough votes for it .\nLawmakers began heading out for the five-week summer recess . But incoming House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , then took to the floor to say `` additional votes are possible , '' indicating lawmakers should stay . Boos could be heard in the House chamber as he made the announcement .\nBut House Republicans later huddled on Capitol Hill before the House adjourned for the day . It was scheduled to meet again Friday morning .\nMeanwhile , a different piece of border legislation died Thursday night in the Senate on a procedural vote . So even if the House did succeed in passing a bill Friday , there was no prospect for reaching a deal to send a bill to Obama 's desk .\nThe second thoughts in the House reflected deep concerns in the GOP caucus about the prospect of leaving for the August recess without addressing the border bill , amid criticism from both sides of the aisle .\nIt remains unclear whether there 's any chance enough votes can be rounded up to pass the measure .
