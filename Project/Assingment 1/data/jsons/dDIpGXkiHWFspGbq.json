John Allen , facing an internal investigation for `` inappropriate communications '' with a woman at the heart of the David Petraeus controversy , engaged in much more than `` flirtatious '' behavior , sources tell Fox News -- with one official even likening the email exchanges to `` phone sex . ''\nThe investigation focuses on emails between Allen and Jill Kelley , a close friend of the Petraeus family . Kelley was the woman who originally notified the FBI when she received threatening emails from Petraeus ' mistress Paula Broadwell -- and that investigation later uncovered the affair .\nOne senior defense official initially described the nature of the communications between Allen and Kelley as `` flirtatious .
