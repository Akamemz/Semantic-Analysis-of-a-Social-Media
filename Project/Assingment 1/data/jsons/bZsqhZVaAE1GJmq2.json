    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nRegarding Buttigieg \u2019 s education proposal , \u201c it stops short of the free-college-for-all plans that Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) have offered , which would wastefully hand tuition subsidies to wealthy families who don \u2019 t need the help . The result is that Mr. Buttigieg can devote some of the money he would raise from the 1 percent to other worthy causes , whereas Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren need new and different revenue-raisers \u2014 some of them implausible or economically risky \u2014 to fund their more expansive programs . It is more progressive to target aid to those who require it , conserving federal resources to do the maximum good\u2026 [ Buttigieg has ] resisted the faux-progressive lure of big , universal programs and designed one that would provide help to those who need it. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c African Americans have evolved on LGBTQ equality just like everyone else . According to the Pew Research Center , only 29 percent of blacks supported same-sex marriage in 2009 . Ten years later , a majority ( 51 percent ) now does . Sure , that is lower than other ethnic groups , but not significantly so\u2026 Black voters don \u2019 t own homophobia and they are not monolithic . Black voters have their specific concerns and they have hopes , dreams and aspirations that are as American as they come . If candidates want their votes , they have to work for them continually and ask for them with sincerity . And if a candidate fails to win over African Americans , the fault is not those voters . It \u2019 s the messenger and their message . Or they simply thought someone else stood a better chance of winning. \u201d Jonathan Capehart , Washington Post\n\u201c Black voters generally favor candidates with a demonstrated history of loyalty to the community . Buttigieg is a young man , relatively unknown , and with a curious history on race relations in South Bend , Ind . He will have to get over those hurdles . Pretending those hurdles don \u2019 t exist , and instead assigning the blame to black homophobia , hurts Buttigieg \u2019 s campaign more than helps it . \u201d Charles M. Blow , New York Times\n\u201c What \u2019 s clear is that Buttigieg is doing well in Iowa mostly because Iowa voters are exactly the kind of people who love Pete Buttigieg : aging , mostly white voters with midwestern sensibilities . The South Bend Mayor is about twice as popular with voters over 65 as he is with voters under 30 , according to a recent New York Times/Siena poll , and overwhelmingly favored by white voters over voters of color . Many midwestern moderates are also drawn to his brand of hopeful liberalism\u2026 But those strengths don \u2019 t necessarily translate outside Iowa \u2026 It \u2019 s not that black voters in South Carolina necessarily dislikePete Buttigieg\u2014they just don \u2019 t likehim . The most typical reaction from the black voters I spoke with during Buttigieg \u2019 s most recent swing through South Carolina was resounding indifference : not a sneer , but a shrug. \u201d Charlotte Alter , Time\nButtigieg \u201c has criticized Warren for being evasive about how she would pay for her Medicare for All plan , which credible sources estimate would cost between $ 31tn and $ 34tn over a decade . Buttigieg \u2019 s proposed Medicare-for-all-who-want-it alternative would also represent an expensive advance on the status quo . But by allowing Americans who have private insurance to keep it if they wish \u2013 unlike Warren and Sanders , who would eliminate it \u2013 Buttigieg can advertise himself as both a progressive and a pragmatist\u2026 \u201c Buttigieg is the most articulate speaker and debater in the presidential race\u2026 [ he ] evokes many of the same themes that launched Obama to the White House in the last decade \u2026 In less than a hundred days , we \u2019 ll find out if Iowa \u2019 s Democratic voters consider his version of \u2018 hope and change \u2019 to be the best approach to take on Trump. \u201d Geoffrey Kabaservice , The Guardian\n\u201c As voters have developed Goldilocks syndrome about the leading Democratic candidates \u2014 too old , too liberal , too \u2026 female ? \u2014 Buttigieg has benefitted from the strong vanilla flavor of his political porridge . His stump speech is about \u2018 American values , correctly understood , \u2019 addresses \u2018 the crisis of belonging , \u2019 scolds the \u2018 cheap nationalism of hugging the flag \u2019 and encourages \u2018 Republicans of conscience \u2019 to come on into the Democratic Party . Like Biden , Buttigieg is selling voters on a nostalgic return to some age of innocence and patriotism that existed before Trump. \u201d Clare Malone , FiveThirtyEight\nThe right remains skeptical that Buttigieg will win the nomination , and criticizes his economic plan .\nThe right remains skeptical that Buttigieg will win the nomination , and criticizes his economic plan .\n\u201c Buttigieg \u2019 s lead has been the headline of the day for mainstream media outlets , but the reason he has a lead is because Buttigieg flooded Iowa with paid TV advertisements\u2026 Buttigieg \u2019 s campaign spent $ 870,000 between November 5 to 11 on TV ads in Iowa alone\u2026 In the third quarter of fundraising , Buttigieg raised $ 19.1 million . Between November 5 to 11 , Buttigieg \u2019 s campaign spent approximately 5 percent of that money in just one week\u2013high spending for just one state\u2026 Nationally , Buttigieg is far from the top three and not \u2018 top tier. \u2019 With intense money poured into television ads and staff in Iowa , Buttigieg may be at the top in one state , but this poll is not indicative of his campaign on the national level . \u201d\n\u201c The Buttigieg campaign is heavily invested in Iowa and has little in the way of infrastructure or support elsewhere\u2026 To have a sustainable campaign , Buttigieg must look beyond Iowa and broaden his appeal while fending off attacks from his rivals . If Mayor Pete can hold on for three months to pull off an upset victory in Iowa , then he may be able to parley his new frontrunner status into more victories . \u201d\n\u201c A big question hanging over Buttigieg \u2019 s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary votersto capture the nomination\u2026 Buttigieg \u2019 s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden , former vice president to America \u2019 s first black president , retains a commanding lead among black voters . But Buttigieg \u2019 s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation\u2026\n\u201c Gallup has long tested voters \u2019 bias against political candidates based on various factors\u2026 this year , 17 percent of Democrats said they would not vote for a gay or lesbian candidate . A spokeswoman for Gallup tells National Review that while 9 percent of white Democrats said they would not vote for a gay or lesbian candidate , 22 percent of non-white Democrats said they would not vote for a gay or lesbian candidate . And recall that this is a question about voting in a general election for a \u2018 generally well-qualified \u2019 nominee of one \u2019 s own party . The percentage of Democrats who would be reluctant to vote for a candidate in the Democratic primary due to his sexual orientation is surely higher than that . \u201d\n\u201c For Democrats to avoid a contested convention\u2026 they need for the field to narrow to essentially two main candidates relatively early on . This seemed to be a possibility when it was looking like Warren and Joe Biden were co-front-runners\u2026\n\u201c A Buttigieg victory in Iowa would be particularly disruptive . A big reason is that for months , polls have consistently shown him in the low single digits among black voters , who play a critical role in later states . While it might be conceivable for a candidate to lose black voters and still win , no Democrat will be able to do as poorly as Buttigieg has been performing and have a path to the nomination . But if he wins Iowa , he 'll have ample reason to justify staying in the race for a long time ( and the cash to do it ) , which would allow him to vacuum up delegates in states and congressional districts with whiter electorates . \u201d\n\u201c Buttigieg is getting a hard look from anxious Democrats . If Joe Biden can \u2019 t perform better and Elizabeth Warren seems unelectable , then who \u2019 s on deck ? Maybe it \u2019 s Pete , the mild Midwestern mayor\u2026 As a result , he \u2019 ll be getting more scrutiny for his ideas , and on Friday he released what he called \u2018 An Economic Agenda for American Families. \u2019 For a candidate who wants to occupy the moderate lane , Mr. Buttigieg \u2019 s policy details veer notably left\u2026\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t an economic agenda , and there isn \u2019 t a pro-growth item anywhere . It \u2019 s a social-welfare spending and union wish list . Mr. Buttigieg tosses off these grand plans in a seven-page campaign paper , which mentions not once how he intends to pay for them . Don \u2019 t forget the billions more he has allocated to green energy , as well as his $ 1.5 trillion health-care public option , \u2018 Medicare for All Who Want It. \u2019 So far Mayor Pete \u2019 s agenda totals $ 5.7 trillion , as his campaign told the Indianapolis Star last week . Mr. Buttigieg plans to pay for it , the Star reports , \u2018 largely through a capital gains tax on the top 1 % of all earners and through eliminating President Donald Trump \u2019 s tax cuts. \u2019 Details to come later , apparently . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
