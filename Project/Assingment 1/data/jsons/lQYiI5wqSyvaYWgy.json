    "content": "On April 16 , President Donald Trump and the White House 's COVID-19 task force outlined a three-step process for states to begin unwinding their economic shutdowns . The plan was contingent on ramping up testing and slowing the spread of new cases , and it likely would have taken months to progress from phase one to phase three .\nJust three weeks later , a growing number of states have largely discarded the federal plan in favor of their own efforts aimed at restarting their shattered economies .\nOn April 22 , Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Wolf outlined a three-step process for reopening regions of his state , with counties progressing from `` red '' to `` yellow '' to `` green . '' Counties can be fully reopened when there are fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over two weeks . The state has cleared 37 counties ( out of 67 ) to move to the `` yellow '' stage on May 15 .\nLess than three weeks later , officials in six Pennsylvania counties that have yet to meet that threshold have declared their intention to reopen anyway , and sheriffs in two other counties say they will not issue citations to businesses that open in defiance of the state 's shutdown order . Although the county commissioners acted independently from one another , all make more or less the same argument : The state-mandated economic shutdown has been ruinous , the vast majority of coronavirus deaths in Pennsylvania have been in nursing homes , and the 50-in-100,000 threshold will take too long to reach .\nThe response to the coronavirus pandemic may appear to have been directed by government edict . State governments ordered people to stay home and forced businesses to close , and the White House had daily press briefings to prescribe courses of action . Frustrated residents of various states have directed their outrage towards governors by staging protests at state capitols .\nBut the weekslong shutdowns that some parts of the country continue to endure were never enforceable from the White House or from any state capitol . They always depended on voluntary compliance from residents . Indeed , most state-level stay-at-home orders came days or even weeks after most Americans were already staying home , as research from FiveThirtyEight pretty conclusively shows .\nThat compliance is now fraying in many places . And that 's why governments can not fully control the economic reopening . It 's not a few dozen protesters who will end the quarantines ; it 's the millions of other people who have simply started going about their lives again .\nOfficials need to recognize the limits of their authority .
