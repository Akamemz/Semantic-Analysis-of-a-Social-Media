More important , it could have more impact on the immediate future of the country than her husband 's celebrated 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention in Boston . Why ?\nHer speech tied the Obamas ' personal stories directly to the lives of millions of voters struggling not to be the first generation of Americans unable to offer hope of greater opportunities to their children than they had , thus drawing a contrast with Mitt Romney as an unnamed but unmistakable caricature of privilege without shading her talk with negativity or animosity .\nIn fact the overall emotion , and there was far more real as opposed to rhetorical emotion than any speech at this level in memory , was a feeling rarely conveyed in our political language today -- love .\nThe first lady was not afraid to use the word love openly and often , in relation to working people of all classes , armed services families , immigrants , parents and especially to her husband and her children . And she was not afraid to show an emotional connection to her words in a performance that was as remarkable for its passion and sincerity as for its many quotable lines .\nLike humor , authentic feeling is risky business in historic addresses , but the rewards can be a level of connection and a sense of strength deeper than any amount of lectern-pounding can drive home .\nBut while these qualities , like the many others now being cited by commentators of all beliefs and backgrounds , help explain why the first lady 's speech already has a place in the history books , they do not explain why it may actually change what will be written in them .
