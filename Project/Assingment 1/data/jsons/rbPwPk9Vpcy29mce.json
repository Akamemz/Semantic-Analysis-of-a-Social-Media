    "content": "A quiet but telling revelation about the Clinton Foundation : Though the organization claims to devote 88 percent of its expenditures on \u201c life changing work , \u201d it really spent a mere 10 percent on charitable grants that support such works .\nSo says Sean Davis , the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov . Rick Perry .\n\u201c Hillary Clinton \u2019 s non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants , \u201d says Mr. Davis , who reached this conclusion after examining the foundation \u2019 s 2013 tax filings and doing all the math . He found that 10 percent of all expenditures \u2014 that \u2019 s $ 8.5 million \u2014 went to travel costs . Employee fringe benefits amounted to $ 3.7 million , computer and tech costs were $ 2.1 million , rent $ 4 million and the final bill for all those foundation conferences was $ 9.2 million .\nYes , well . The tax-exempt organization has claimed that no more than 12 percent of its expenditures went to these \u201c overhead expenses , \u201d Mr. Davis observes .\n\u201c How can both claims be true ? Easy : they \u2019 re not . The claim from the Clinton Foundation that 88 percent of all expenditures go directly to life-changing work is demonstrably false . Office chairs do not directly save lives . The Internet connection for the group \u2019 s headquarters does not directly change lives , \u201d he concludes in the research .\nSEE ALSO : Hillary Clinton gets gay-friendly social media avatar , 1 year after saying marriage is a state issue\nIt is the cold reality for presidential hopefuls : favorability ratings come and go . A candidate can be \u201c ridin \u2019 high in April and shot down in May , \u201d as Frank Sinatra counseled in the 1966 anthem \u201c That \u2019 s Life . \u201d\nOne Republican seems to be ridin \u2019 high at the very moment . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker has maintained a lead over his rivals in several polls over the weeks , including one released Tuesday from Public Policy Polling , this gauging the sentiment of those all-important Iowa Republican voters .\n\u201c Walker has the highest favorability out of anyone in the field , with 59 percent viewing him favorably , \u201d the survey states . \u201c The key to Walker \u2019 s success is that he \u2019 s winning both among voters who are most concerned about electability in the general election and among voters who are most concerned with having the most conservative candidate . \u201d\nAmong voters who say that a \u201c being able to win \u201d is their top priority , Mr. Walker leads by a narrower margin . His lead is much more emphatic among voters who say \u201c conservatism is their top priority \u201d : 29 percent favor the governor , compared to 14 percent for Sen. Ted Cruz , 12 percent for Sen. Rand Paul , and 10 percent for Mike Huckabee \u2014 who won the 2008 Republican presidential caucuses in the Hawkeye State .\n\u201c If I decide to run , I will make the country great again , because I love this country and this country is going to hell , and everybody knows it As you know , I knew Ronald Reagan . I have a great respect for Ronald Reagan . We \u2019 re different in that he was a politician .

Senators Rand Paul , Ted Cruz , and Marco Rubio have made it clear that they stand with taxpayers now and in the future , \u201d says Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , the nonpartisan coalition which maintains the aforementioned pledge .\nIt \u2019 s popular with everyone else .
