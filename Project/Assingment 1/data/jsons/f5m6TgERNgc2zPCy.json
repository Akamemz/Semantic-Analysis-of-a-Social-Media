    "content": "A Pentagon official signaled Wednesday that the U.S. is pressing the Turkish government to intervene in support of Kurdish forces desperately battling to keep the Syrian border town of Kobani from falling into Islamic State hands .\nPentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told Fox News that U.S. officials are talking with the Turks about `` what they can or will or may do here . ''\nHe added : `` This is a decision the Turkish government has to make . We ca n't make it for them . ''\nAt a press briefing later in the day , Kirby clarified that the United States is not `` making demands of the Turks , '' but hopes they will `` contribute what they can . ''\nThe situation in the town of Kobani has intensified , and with it concerns over whether partners on the ground are doing enough .\nThe New York Times reported earlier that the White House is growing frustrated with Turkish inaction as the situation next door in Kobani gets worse .\nKirby also stressed the `` limits of airpower '' and said the U.S. needs more help on the ground .\n`` There 's just so much you can do from the air , '' he told Fox News . `` You 've got to have willing partners on the ground . You 've got to have ground forces . ''\nThe New York Times quoted a senior administration official who slammed the Ankara government for `` dragging its feet to act to prevent a massacre less than a mile from its border . ''\n`` After all the fulminating about Syria 's humanitarian catastrophe , they 're inventing reasons not to act to avoid another catastrophe , '' the official continued . `` This is n't how a NATO ally acts while hell is unfolding a stone 's throw from their border . ''\nThe Times reported that Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu multiple times over the prior 72 hours in an effort to resolve tensions between the two sides .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the U.S.-led coalition 's air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the Islamic State group 's advance . Turkish troops have been massed near the border since the assault on Kobani began , but have so far not taken an offensive posture .\n`` Kobani is about to fall , '' Erdogan told Syrian refugees in the Turkish border town of Gaziantep , according to The Associated Press . The Turkish president called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition , which is fighting both the extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad .\n`` We asked for three things : one , for a no-fly zone to be created ; two , for a secure zone parallel to the region to be declared ; and for the moderate opposition in Syria and Iraq to be trained and equipped . ''\nThe Times reported that President Obama prefers that Erdogan not tether the fight against Islamic State , commonly known as ISIS , to the effort to overthrow Assad . U.S. officials also tell the paper that Erdogan 's demand for a no-fly zone against the Syrian Air Force is meaningless on the grounds that the airstrikes have created a no-fly zone in all but name .\nThe call for a buffer zone inside Syria was , meanwhile , prompting confusion .
