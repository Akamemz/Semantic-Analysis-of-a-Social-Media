This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap ' to keep the UK in the EU 's customs union , which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals . There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , and about 14 % of those crossings are consignments of goods , some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer . Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border , but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras , which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland .\nAsked whether the agreement was the final possible deal for the EU , he declined to comment .\nUnder the agreement , Barnier said , Northern Ireland would stay in the EU \u2019 s single market for goods and the EU \u2019 s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland .\n\u201c This means that all applicable procedures on goods will take place at points on entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island , \u201d he said .\nBut Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK \u2019 s customs territory , to allow the prime minister to boast the country \u201c whole and entire \u201d had left the EU .\nBarnier said : \u201c It will therefore benefit from the UK future trade policy . But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into our single market . So what have we done to square this circle ?

However , for goods at risk of entering the single market the UK authorities will apply the EU tariffs . \u201d\nBusinesses in Northern Ireland will be able to apply for rebates if the UK has lower tariff rates on goods imported from outside the EU .\nThe new Irish protocol also includes a last-minute compromise on VAT , after negotiators worked through the night to resolve this final sticking point .

A joint committee of EU and UK officials will oversee how the system works .\nUnder a complicated consent mechanism , four years after the end of the transition period , the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements .\nThe assembly would have to decide whether to vote by a simple majority or under a vote in which 40 % of both nationalist and unionist assembly members would be required to give their assent .
