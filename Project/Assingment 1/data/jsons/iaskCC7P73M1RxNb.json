The hospital cited the 2003 SARS outbreak , Covid-19 cases in South Korea and China , the assessment of the hospital \u2019 s senior medical staff , and the effectiveness of the protective gear in an internal communication seen by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c My frustration is that I have never felt like my safety is important , \u201d this physician said . \u201c When I \u2019 m going to work , I could endanger me and my family and I feel like my institution doesn \u2019 t even care at all . \u201d\nReached for comment about the concerns of its staff , New York-Presbyterian said it is \u201c treating a large influx of COVID-19 patients , as anticipated . The health and safety of every patient in our care , as well as our entire staff , continues to be our highest priority . \u201d\n\u201c We continue to implement measures to increase capacity , including triage tents and reassignment of beds and units , cancellations of all elective surgeries , and utilization of telemedicine if possible , \u201d the hospital said in a statement . \u201c We are also conserving supplies , including personal protective equipment , to help meet this challenge , which we expect to continue . \u201d\nNew York is living through what other cities may soon experience . Morale is low and the mood anxious across the country , as the pandemic continues to worsen . Based on what we \u2019 ve seen already in other countries , a lot of doctors and nurses are highly likely to get sick .\n\u201c As soon as you have the first case , you immediately have a staffing problem ; you \u2019 re probably furloughing people who made the first contacts before you had test results , \u201d Chip Kahn , president of the Federation of American Hospitals , said . \u201c Then as you get further into it , it gets more and more intense . \u201d\nAnd the problem that other countries face may be worse in America .\n\u201c With already lower staffing ratios plus the very real risk of losing more [ health care workers ] due to illness , this could spiral and get much worse , \u201d Jen Kates , who leads the global health program at the Kaiser Family Foundation , said .\nIf too many doctors and nurses get infected themselves and can \u2019 t care for patients , or if hospitals lay off workers because they are losing revenue with many of their other operations on hold , the health system \u2019 s capacity is going to deteriorate even further .\nHealth care workers face more exposure to the coronavirus , and they may also get sicker\nDoctors and nurses may have a higher chance of getting seriously ill from the coronavirus if they do get infected . The numbers from the initial Wuhan , China , outbreak indicate 15 percent of the roughly 1,700 Covid-19 cases for medical personnel as of mid-February were critical or severe . Five had died .\nThe World Health Organization \u2019 s report found that health care workers were actually not more at risk of infection than other people . But the WHO also noted that \u201c attention to the prevention of infection in health care workers is of paramount importance in China . Surveillance among health care workers identified factors early in the outbreak that placed [ health care workers ] at higher risk of infection , and this information has been used to modify policies to improve protection . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that they \u2019 re getting infected at higher rates ; instead , they \u2019 re getting sicker than one might expect on the basis of their age , \u201d says Peter Hotez , the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College , of health care workers in Wuhan .\nOne theory for why that could be : Medical staff are exposed to high levels of the virus as they work in hospitals and interact with patients . But we don \u2019 t know for sure .\nThe early data from the European countries hit the hardest by Covid-19 indicates health care workers account for a significant share of their Covid-19 cases . In Spain , government officials reported on Tuesday that medical staff accounted for 14 percent of the country \u2019 s nearly 40,000 reported cases . In Italy as of March 22 , almost 1 in 10 coronavirus cases was a health care worker .\nAnd in America , given our known shortage of protective medical gear and lax protocols reported at some hospitals , we can not necessarily expect the same resilience among our medical staff as China saw . More than 100 workers in Boston \u2019 s three biggest hospitals have already tested positive for Covid-19 , according to local news reports on Wednesday .\n\u201c The burden it \u2019 s placing on our hospitals , with the lack of equipment \u2014 we feel ill-prepared for it , \u201d said Stefan Flores , an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University in New York City .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like showing up to war with a knife at this point . I don \u2019 t know if I am going to have a mask the next day , \u201d Flores said . He keeps two or three masks in a bioprotective bag at the end of the workday , washing it and preventing it from being soiled , because he doesn \u2019 t know when they \u2019 re going to get more . He leaves them in a designated section of his apartment .\nAn ER doctor in Pennsylvania told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that as hospitals face personal protective gear shortages , incomplete protection from exposure means more doctors and medical staff out sick . That will lead to worse outcomes overall for coronavirus patients .\nBut they have no choice but to adapt to these circumstances ; hospitals and ERs can \u2019 t shutter in the middle of an outbreak because they lack protective equipment .\nDemand for personal protective gear has been extraordinary ; one health care supply company reported it had seen demand for N95 masks double during the outbreak . Some hospitals have reportedly run out of a month \u2019 s worth of supplies in just a few days .\nMeanwhile , hospitals are already pushing staff to the limit in an effort to keep enough doctors and nurses on call to respond to the pandemic . One nurse at a major metropolitan hospital , who asked for anonymity to avoid angering their employer , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that staff had been instructed to come to work as long as their temperature did not exceed 101 degrees Fahrenheit and they weren \u2019 t coughing , regardless of their known exposure to the coronavirus . They were given brown bags to keep their N95 mask in so the mask could be reused .\nFlores said that initially , doctors and medical staff at his hospital were asked to quarantine if they were simply exposed to a coronavirus patient . \u201c Obviously , that very changed quickly once we realized with the sheer number of people who actually were infected with [ coronavirus ] was so high that it was fine ; you were going to be exposed . Now , it \u2019 s as long as you \u2019 re symptomatic . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just infections that could shrink hospital staff . Many hospitals are starting to postpone elective surgeries ( which can include procedures for serious conditions like cancer and heart disease , as well as less urgent surgeries ) so as to free up more staff for coronavirus response and to reduce the risk of more people getting infected .\nCanceled surgeries mean a loss in revenue for those hospitals . One rural hospital in Georgia told Modern Healthcare it could lose half of its revenue with elective services delayed . Industry leaders have warned that hundreds of hospitals could close without a huge infusion of cash from Congress . The deal recently struck in the Senate would pump $ 100 billion into US hospitals in a bid to stave off disaster .\nIf doctors and nurses can \u2019 t work , hospitals can \u2019 t care for as many people\nBefore the coronavirus ever came to our shores , America was at a hospital staffing disadvantage compared to other rich countries . Overall , US hospitals employ as many people or more per capita as our economic peers . But staffing is disproportionately tilted toward administrative work in the United States .\nIf you focus on health care professionals specifically , US hospitals trail behind most European countries and Canada . Our hospitals employ almost as many administrative staff as medical staff , according to estimates from the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker .\nAnd US hospitals were already at risk of being overrun if the number of Covid-19 cases explodes before fears about staffing shortages fully set in .\nAmerica has about 924,000 hospital beds , about 98,000 of which can be used for people who need intensive care , according to the American Hospital Association . The number of Covid-19 cases that will require ICU care could expand far beyond what the US is currently capable of providing .\nImperial College London projections from last week , while just one set of estimates among many and based largely on modeling for influenza outbreaks instead of the current facts on the ground , painted a grim picture . It found even the most aggressive mitigation strategies \u2014 general social distancing , quarantines , closing schools \u2014 would not be enough to prevent US hospitals from eventually being overwhelmed unless the country is willing to commit to these drastic measures until a vaccine becomes available .\nFor people 60 and older , between 17 and 25 percent of cases are expected to require hospitalization ; of those , 25 percent or more will require intensive care ( as many as 70 percent for patients 80 and older ) , according to this analysis . The ability of hospitals to provide that care will be imperative if we are to protect those most vulnerable populations .\nItalian hospitals could provide a frightening preview of what \u2019 s to come in the US as their system is overwhelmed by coronavirus and medical personnel are put at risk . A group of doctors from a hospital in Bergamo , Italy , facing 4,305 Covid-19 cases in their city with just 48 ICU beds available , painted a grave picture in a recent New England Journal of Medicine op-ed :\nWe are learning that hospitals might be the main Covid-19 carriers , as they are rapidly populated by infected patients , facilitating transmission to uninfected patients . Patients are transported by our regional system,1 which also contributes to spreading the disease as its ambulances and personnel rapidly become vectors . Health workers are asymptomatic carriers or sick without surveillance ; some might die , including young people , which increases the stress of those on the front line .\nThe toll on hospital workers will manifest in many ways . Research out of China found high levels of stress and depression among health care workers who were responding to the coronavirus outbreak .\nAlready , US doctors are on edge .
