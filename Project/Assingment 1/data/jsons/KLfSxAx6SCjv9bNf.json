Pushkov said on Twitter , according to The Telegraph :\n`` Information about the use by Assad of chemical weapons has been fabricated in the same place as the lies about ( Saddam ) Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction ...

Some worried , Deb said , that such a victory would embolden the Assad regime to walk away from the peace talks they had agreed to .\n`` This announcement appears to be an attempt to recalibrate the balance of power on the ground , but still in the service of a negotiated settlement , '' she said .\n-- A No Fly Zone : The Wall Street Journal reports that among the options for the United States is setting up a no-fly zone over Syria . The paper says :\n`` Asked by the White House to develop options for Syria , military planners have said that creating an area to train and equip rebel forces would require keeping Syrian aircraft well away from the Jordanian border . `` To do that , the military envisages creating a no-fly zone stretching up to 25 miles into Syria which would be enforced using aircraft flown from Jordanian bases and flying inside the kingdom , according to U.S . officials . ''\n-- 'Caravan Of Lies ' : Reuters reports that the Syrian Foreign Ministry called the White House statement about the use of chemical weapons a `` caravan of lies . '' The ministry also said the decision by the United States to provide military support for the rebeles reveals a `` flagrant double standard '' when it comes to how it deals with terrorism .",
