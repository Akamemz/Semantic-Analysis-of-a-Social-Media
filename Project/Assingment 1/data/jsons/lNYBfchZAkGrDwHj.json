    "content": "The jobs and unemployment numbers come out at precisely 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time , almost always on the first Friday of the month , and at 8:31 the pundits are either jumping for joy or slumping in disappointment over what those numbers \u201c reveal . \u201d\nThey need to stop doing that , because one month \u2019 s numbers don \u2019 t tell you the big picture .\nHere \u2019 s what the big picture reveals : We \u2019 re in trouble . Big trouble . We-can \u2019 t-go-on-like-this trouble . And an increase of 200,000 or so jobs each month and a decrease of a tenth-of-a-percent in the unemployment rate every few months will do nothing to change that .\nThat \u2019 s because If you have a job , you get paid , and a portion of your pay goes to the government in the form of income taxes , which provide the money the government needs to run the country , which is expressed in the form of an annual budget .\nIf the government collects more in taxes than the budget requires , we have a surplus . ( We \u2019 ll pause for laughter . )\nIf the government collects less in taxes than the budget requires , we have a deficit .\nAnd that \u2019 s what we have right now . Our government set a budget of $ 3 trillion last fiscal year , and it spent close to $ 3.6 trillion . The difference between those amounts is our deficit \u2013 about $ 600 billion .\nTo get rid of that deficit , we need to raise more money . And to do that , we need to increase the number of people with jobs who pay the taxes that provide that money .\nSo how many more full-time jobs do we need to break even ? The answer to that is why we \u2019 re in trouble .\nOn average , each new full-time job pays around $ 50,000 , a salary that translates to about $ 12,500 in federal income tax . When we divide $ 600 billion by $ 12,500 , we learn that we need to add 48 MILLION new full-time jobs to make up the deficit .\nSo much for the \u201c good news \u201d that 209,000 jobs -- and they weren \u2019 t even all full-time jobs -- were created in July . At this rate , 2.5 million new jobs will be created each year . It \u2019 s terrific that all those people will have jobs , but the tax revenue generated from those jobs will reduce the deficit by only $ 30 billion \u2013 a mere 5 percent of the total deficit .\nSo how do we eliminate the deficit ? We not only have to increase job growth at multiples of what we \u2019 re doing now , but we also have to cut spending \u2013 drastically .\nIf we doubled the number of jobs created each month to 400,000 , it would reduce the deficit by $ 60 billion in a year . This means we would have to cut expenses by 15 percent to eliminate the remaining $ 540 billion deficit .\nBut our government is incapable of cutting expenses . Remember the big fight over the sequester ? All that did was slow the rate of increase in spending , not cut total spending itself .\nKeep this in mind every time you read about a bill that requires spending . Stop for a moment to think in terms of how many new full-time jobs it will take to pay for it . If we think about where the money has to come from , maybe we \u2019 ll decide we don \u2019 t need that bill .\nStop for a moment and think when you consider President Obama \u2019 s request to spend $ 4 billion to help solve our border crisis . To pay that $ 4 billion , we \u2019 ll need to create 320,000 new jobs \u2026 all for a piece of legislation designed to bring illegal workers into America who will take jobs away from Americans , thus decreasing the number of tax-generating jobs for American citizens .\nRemember , the government \u2019 s money doesn \u2019 t grow on trees , and it doesn \u2019 t come from a printing press . It comes from tax revenue .\nAnd there \u2019 s more thing . . . I haven \u2019 t even mentioned our $ 18 trillion national debt .",
