    "content": "On a frigid March morning , Eric Holder strode into a brick union hall on the west side of Milwaukee , across from a credit union and an auto body shop . The Merrill Park neighborhood was once the center of the city \u2019 s Irish political machine , filled with stately Victorian houses\u2014including the childhood home of Spencer Tracy\u2014but it was now mostly African American and economically depressed .\nHolder had dressed down from his usual suit and tie : He wore a black fleece jacket , white button-down , and dark blue jeans . He was warmly greeted by Angela Lang , the 29-year-old executive director of Black Leaders Organ\u00adizing for Communities ( BLOC ) , a local group that works to increase voter turnout in Milwaukee \u2019 s black neighborhoods from an office in the union hall \u2019 s basement , which was filled with campaign flyers and maps . It was the 68-year-old former attorney general \u2019 s third visit to Milwaukee in a year , and Lang addressed him as \u201c our No . 1 cousin . \u201d\nThe reason for Holder \u2019 s visits was Wisconsin \u2019 s assault on voting rights . The Wisconsin GOP had passed a voter ID law , designed to depress Democratic participation , that took effect before the 2016 election . As a result , turnout in Milwaukee \u2019 s black neighborhoods dropped by more than 20 percent .\nNot long after the election , Holder launched the Nation\u00adal Democratic Redistricting Committee ( NDRC ) , a political action committee that aims to unrig the system that has entrenched Republican control of the country \u2019 s most important swing states . He \u2019 d received the backing of top Democrats , including former President Barack Obama , who in December 2018 folded his own political operation , Organizing for Action , into Holder \u2019 s to give the fight against gerrymandering more clout . Now , while other top Democrats are focused on the White House , Holder has set his sights on neighborhoods like Merrill Park and on races like the one he was there to talk about , a state Supreme Court contest that had received virtually no attention outside Wisconsin .\n\u201c This state is in some ways ground zero for gerrymandering , \u201d Holder told two dozen BLOC canvassers who would knock on doors that afternoon for the progressive judge running in the race . \u201c Last year they called it a blue wave , and yet you didn \u2019 t flip one congressional seat here in Wisconsin . That \u2019 s not because you didn \u2019 t work hard or people didn \u2019 t vote . It was because of gerrymandering. \u201d Republicans had so effectively gerrymandered the state that even when Democrats won 53 percent of the statewide vote in 2018 , they took only 36 percent of the seats in the state legislature .\nHolder views gerrymandering , which manipulates district lines to benefit one party , as part of a broader struggle for voting rights , since it effectively diminishes the value of certain communities \u2019 votes . \u201c There is a direct connection between gerrymandering and voter suppression , not only here in Wisconsin but in places around the country , \u201d Holder told me before his speech at the union hall . \u201c It is not a coincidence that you see the greatest amount of voter suppression in those states where you see the greatest amount of gerrymandering . \u201d\nFor decades , Democrats successfully fought these twin efforts at disenfranchisement in the courts . As Obama \u2019 s attorney general , Holder led that charge , filing lawsuits against states like North Carolina and Texas that challenged Republican-\u00adbacked laws curbing the right to vote . But this tactic was handed an enormous defeat in 2013 , when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in Shelby County v. Holder , ruling that states with a long history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval to change voting laws . Last week , the court struck another blow , declaring that federal courts couldn \u2019 t block partisan gerrymandering . Voting rights advocates face not only a hostile Trump administration but a growing number of federal benches controlled by conservatives . As the GOP \u2019 s war on voting has intensified , the traditional ways of protecting ballot access are no longer reliable .\n\u201c There is a direct connection between gerrymandering and voter suppression , not only here in Wisconsin but in places around the country , \u201d Holder said .\nSo Holder is pursuing a new strategy , trying to elect down-ballot candidates who can deliver fairer maps and voting laws . The NDRC invested $ 350,000 in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race , hoping that a liberal majority on the seven-\u00admember court might strike down any egregious gerrymanders in the next round of redistricting in 2021 . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that 10 years or so ago , you would have a former attorney general campaigning for a state Supreme Court justice , \u201d Holder told me . \u201c This is a recognition on the part of the Democratic Party , on the part of progressives , that we need to focus on state and local elections to a much greater degree than we have in the past . \u201d\nBut if Democrats are belatedly recognizing this need , few besides Holder are acting on it . He is playing a long game in a party driven by instant gratification and consumed by the mess in the White House . While the party \u2019 s presidential contenders are attracting big crowds , donors , and volunteers determined to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020 , Holder is focused on 2021 .\nThe Constitution requires states to redraw their political districts every 10 years . In 2011 , after routing Democrats in midterm elections the previous fall , Republicans took control of critical swing states including Wisconsin , drawing electoral maps that cemented their power . Now history is at risk of repeating itself . If Democrats don \u2019 t start devoting more attention and resources to state races , Holder warned the BLOC canvassers , 2021 could end up like 2011 . The battle for control of state governments will determine the arc of American politics for the next decade , but it is already overshadowed by the 20-some Democrats running for president . Holder is fighting not just a well-funded Republican opposition but also his own party \u2019 s narrow focus on the presidency .\n\u201c I understand people are going to be legitimately focused on the presidential race , as we should be , \u201d Holder said . \u201c But it \u2019 s going to be my job to make sure we don \u2019 t lose sight of those other races that are going to be extremely important . \u201d\nUntil recently , Holder \u2019 s strategy was a radical concept within the Democratic Party . Before the NDRC , there was no single group formulating a centralized strategy for gaining control of the redistricting process , as Republicans had done so successfully in 2010 . That \u2019 s where Holder came in . Never before had a Democrat of his stature devoted so much attention to such a wonky issue .\n\u201c I famously said I \u2019 ve got to make redistricting sexy , \u201d Holder recalled with a laugh as we sat in his Washington , DC , office at the law firm Covington & Burling , located in the glitzy new CityCenterDC complex . His corner office has views of the Washington Monument and busts of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on the shelves . \u201c My hope was\u2014and I know President Obama \u2019 s hope was\u2014that my being directly involved would give this effort a degree of attention that it might not otherwise have , \u201d he said .\nDemocrats didn \u2019 t have a redistricting strategy because , for many years , they didn \u2019 t need one . They controlled a majority of state legislatures for most of the post\u2013World War II era , drawing electoral maps in twice as many states as Re\u00adpublicans in the 1980s and 1990s . Democrats were sitting pretty heading into the 2010 elections after winning big in 2006 and 2008 , controlling more than 60 percent of state legislative chambers .\nNever before has a Democrat of Holder \u2019 s stature devoted so much attention to such a wonky issue .\nThen the GOP launched an aggressive bid to reclaim power at the state level , creating the Redistricting Majority Project ( REDMAP ) to target state legislative races and put Republicans in charge of redistricting efforts after the 2010 census . The effort was overseen by former Repub\u00adlican National Committee Chair Ed Gillespie and advised by strategists like Karl Rove . \u201c He who controls redistricting can control Congress , \u201d Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal at the time .\nMassively aided by the Supreme Court \u2019 s 2010 Citizens United decision that allowed unlimited corporate political spending , REDMAP raised $ 30 million , including from oil , tobacco , and health insurance companies , three times as much as its Democratic counterpart . Republicans hoped to flip 25 to 30 House seats occupied by Democrats . They ended up winning 63 , plus 20 new legislative chambers , giving them control of nearly every important swing state and the power to draw four times as many state legislative and House districts as Democrats . Nearly a decade later , Republi\u00adcans still control every legislative chamber in heavily gerry\u00admandered states like Michigan , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin .\nDemocrats had no comparable strategy . And when the party controlled the White House and Congress after Obama \u2019 s 2008 victory , it paid little attention to the states . By the end of Obama \u2019 s second term , Democrats had lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats . \u201c This has been one of the big failures of our party , \u201d said former Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , who led the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005 . \u201c We have not paid attention to the importance of redistricting\u2014haven \u2019 t put the time in historically . \u201d\n\u201c One of the great deficiencies of the Obama operation during the eight years he was president , \u201d said Obama \u2019 s former chief strategist , David Axelrod , \u201c was that not enough attention was paid to legislative races. \u201d The president , consumed by the financial crisis and the Obamacare fight , didn \u2019 t sustain a political operation that could combat the tea party wave and the GOP \u2019 s surgical targeting of state races . Now , Axelrod said , this deficiency is something Obama , a former state senator , \u201c feels acutely , feels some responsibility for , and wants to help remedy . \u201d\nMcAuliffe and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi convened discussions during the 2016 Democratic Nation\u00adal Convention about creating a group focused solely on redistricting . The initiative took on new urgency after Hillary Clinton lost the presidential race even as she won the popular vote , re\u00adinforcing the imperative that Democrats regain power at the state level . After the election , McAuliffe , Pelosi , and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer visited the White House to get Obama \u2019 s blessing . \u201c It was the president who said , \u2018 I \u2019 ll bring Eric in , \u2019 \u201d McAuliffe recalled . Obama decided to make redistricting reform a central focus of his post-\u00adpresidency and tapped Holder as his top lieutenant . Obama has hosted fundraisers for the effort , endorsed candidates in races the NDRC has targeted , and used his email list and social media profile to draw attention to the fight against gerrymandering . \u201c In America , politicians shouldn \u2019 t pick their voters , \u201d Obama said in a 2018 video promoting Holder \u2019 s group . \u201c Voters are supposed to pick their politicians . \u201d\nFor Holder , the cause was personal . \u201c The right to vote , \u201d he said when he launched the NDRC in 2017 , was \u201c a right that has been a part of my consciousness as long as I can remember. \u201d As a 12-year-old in 1963 , Holder sat in his basement in East Elmhurst , Queens , and watched on a black-and-white television as Vivian Malone became one of the first black students to integrate the University of Alabama . Twenty-six years later , he would marry her younger sister , Sharon , an obstetrician . Vivian went on to lead a group that registered black voters in the South and worked in the Justice Department \u2019 s Civil Rights Division . She died in 2005 , before Holder became the first black attorney general . \u201c Her not being able to see her brother-in-law become attorney general of the United States is one of those really unfortunate things , \u201d Holder told me in Wisconsin , his eyes welling up . \u201c Even thinking about it now , I can get a little emotional . \u201d\nMore votes , fewer seats In some Republican controlled states , gerrymandering has made it all but impossible for Democrats to retake assemblies , even when they win a majority of the statewide vote .\nChallenging the GOP \u2019 s redistricting edge required a multipronged approach : Holder \u2019 s group has filed or assisted a dozen lawsuits against gerrymandered maps , supported local candidates whose races had implications for redistricting , and backed state ballot measures to establish independent redistricting commissions . \u201c He \u2019 s a uniting force between the different pieces of the Democratic ecosystem to get onto a shared strategy to rebuild Democratic power in the states , \u201d said Jessica Post , executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and an NDRC board member . \u201c Having a central electoral coordinating hub is really important . \u201d\nThe Democrats \u2019 gains in 2018 were impressive . Holder \u2019 s group raised $ 35 million\u2014comparable to what REDMAP raised in 2010\u2014helping Democrats flip about 300 state legislative seats , six legis\u00adlative chambers , and seven governorships . In four states , including Wiscon\u00adsin , Republicans lost sole control of state government , and with it their ability to single-handedly draw new districts . The NDRC targeted 230 state seats held by Republicans , focusing on suburban areas that were changing demographically ; Democrats won 60 percent of them . Holder stumped for candidates in 24 states . \u201c We gave financial support to races that otherwise might not have gotten financial support , \u201d he said . \u201c I campaigned in races that would not have gotten that kind of high-level attention . \u201d\nThough he hoped to elect more Demo\u00adcrats , Holder \u2019 s overriding goal was to make the redistricting process less skewed , putting him in conflict with some Democrats who wanted to maximize partisan gain . When New Jersey Democrats proposed giving legislative leaders more power over the drawing of district lines last year , Holder quickly denounced the plan . \u201c I \u2019 m here for a fair process , not to gerrymander for Democrats , \u201d he told me .\nHolder , who has never run for elected office , is an unlikely public face for a major political campaign . He \u2019 s charismatic by the standards of a career lawyer , but no one would mistake him for Obama on the stump , though they do share a love of dad jokes . Still , Holder \u2019 s devotion to technocratic details can be an advantage when it comes to the nuances of redistricting . Holder said he viewed the fight against gerrymandering as a \u201c jigsaw puzzle \u201d and delighted in figuring out which pieces went where .\nHis efforts in Wisconsin began in March 2018 , when the NDRC spent half a million dollars to elect Rebecca Dallet to the state Supreme Court , a huge amount for a state judicial race . Her victory brought Democrats one seat closer to ending the conservative majority on the court , which can rule on state voting laws . To increase African American turnout , Holder \u2019 s group funded BLOC , which knocked on 35,000 doors in Milwaukee in the spring of 2018 and helped achieve higher turnout in Dallet \u2019 s race in neighborhoods like Merrill Park than in a 2015 Supreme Court race .\nHolder returned to Milwaukee last fall to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers , for whom BLOC knocked on more than 173,000 doors in black neighborhoods that statewide political candidates usually bypassed . Evers defeated Gov . Scott Walker by just 30,000 votes , giving Democrats veto power over the state \u2019 s redistricting maps in 2021 .\nHolder also continued the efforts he \u2019 d begun as attorney general by taking Republi\u00adcans to court for infringing on voting rights . When Walker refused to hold special elections for vacant state legislative seats in February 2018 , Holder \u2019 s group sued and won . After the 2018 election , when Republicans cut back on early voting , Holder \u2019 s group sued and won again .\nWalker criticized Holder \u2019 s work in Wisconsin on Twitter several months before the election ; after losing , Walker became finance chair of a new group , the National Republican Redistricting Trust , focused on combating the NDRC . \u201c My role is to counter Eric Holder \u2019 s efforts , \u201d Walker tweeted . \u201c He , with [ t ] he help of former President Obama , have raised some $ 200 million that they are using in court and on the campaign trail . Their goal is to secure Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s control as Speaker for a decade or more. \u201d Walker dramatically overstated the amount raised by Holder \u2019 s group , but it was telling that the former Wisconsin governor\u2014whose party Holder had been desperately trying to catch up with\u2014now thought Holder was ahead of him .\nThe question now is whether Holder \u2019 s group can lock in and expand the gains made in 2018 . Over the next year , the NDRC plans to almost triple its staff to 30 , and the absorption of Obama \u2019 s vaunted Organizing for Action list will give Holder \u2019 s group access to hundreds of thousands of new volunteers to work on state races . \u201c The single most impor\u00adtant thing that could be done at the grassroots level over the next few years is to make sure the rules of the road are fair , \u201d Obama said on a call with these volunteers in December 2018 .\nDemocrats are within six seats of flipping state legislative chambers in Pennsyl\u00advania , North Carolina , Minne\u00adsota , Arizona , and Michigan . \u201c We \u2019 re much closer across the country than people think , \u201d said the DLCC \u2019 s Post . But the GOP still controls 62 of 99 state legislative chambers nationwide and holds the governor \u2019 s mansion and both legislative bodies in 22 states , compared to 14 for Democrats . The bulk of the NDRC \u2019 s efforts will focus on five Republican-controlled gerrymandered states : Florida , Georgia , Ohio , Texas , and North Carolina . Gaining seats there will mean targeting districts in conservative exurbs where Democrats came up short in 2018 . Mark Gersh , a Democratic redistricting expert working with Holder \u2019 s group , said the team is \u201c trying to figure out whether Trump \u2019 s plummeting popularity and behavior might enable us to go beyond the parts we know we can win , because there \u2019 s not enough of them . We won all the low-hanging fruit last time . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s momentum , though . The once-wonky issue of voting rights has become a rallying cry for Democrats . In 2018 , voters in five states approved ballot initiatives that curbed gerrymandering . When Democrats took control of the House , their first piece of legislation was a sweeping reform bill that called for independent redistricting commissions to draw all House districts . ( The proposal died in the Senate after Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on it . ) Schumer said in March that the fight for voting rights should be one of the Democrats \u2019 top three issues , alongside climate change and income inequality .\nVoting rights are \u201c part of a basket of issues that are motivating to people who feel like the character of our democracy is being threatened and that democracy itself is being manipulated , \u201d said Axelrod . But Democrats are still in jeopardy of ignoring the state and local races that will determine the country \u2019 s voting maps . \u201c Our concern is there \u2019 s wall-to-wall coverage of Trump scandals , wall-to-wall coverage of crowd size and presidential announcements , and our job is to continue to make sure people know that the next decade of democracy is on the line in 2020 , \u201d said Post .\nDemocratic strategists working on down-ballot races say the presidential campaign is siphoning away resources . \u201c It \u2019 s harder to recruit people [ to run ] , it \u2019 s harder to get attention to these races , it \u2019 s harder to raise money for them , \u201d said Amanda Litman , executive director of Run for Something , which recruits progressive candidates for local offices . \u201c Quite a few of the donors we work really closely with have been hesitant to reengage , either because they \u2019 re tapped out from 2018 or they \u2019 re waiting for the presidential race to shake out . \u201d\nDemocratic strategists working on down-ballot races say the presidential campaign is siphoning away resources .\nLitman \u2019 s group is coordinating with the NDRC to recruit state legislative candidates to run in every district in the 12 states Holder is targeting in 2020 , but she said reaching Run for Something \u2019 s $ 3 million fundraising goal this year \u201c is like pulling teeth. \u201d That \u2019 s small change for presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden , who each raised about twice that sum on the first day of their campaigns , but it could make the difference in flipping multiple state legislative chambers , Litman said .\nMore money might have changed the outcome of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race . Lisa Neubauer , the progressive judge backed by Holder , was favored to win . But in the final week of the race , the Republican State Leadership Committee , the same group that bankrolled the GOP \u2019 s takeover of the state legislature in 2010 , launched a $ 1.3 million ad campaign for Neubauer \u2019 s opponent , Brian Hagedorn , an ultraconservative judge and former chief counsel to Walker . Meanwhile , Republicans made Holder a talking point\u2014a Facebook ad from Hagedorn admonished , \u201c We can \u2019 t let Eric Holder reshape Wisconsin \u2019 s Supreme Court \u201d \u2014and Neubauer called on Holder and other outside funders to stay out of the race . Turnout surged in conservative , rural parts of the state , and Hagedorn won by about 6,000 votes , cementing a right-wing majority on the court through at least 2023 .\nThe day after the election , Holder spoke at the annual convention of Al Sharpton \u2019 s National Action Network . A dozen Democratic presidential candidates were there , and none had campaigned for Neubauer . \u201c It seems I \u2019 m the only one here who isn \u2019 t running for president in 2020 , \u201d Holder joked . He \u2019 d flirted with his own long-shot presidential bid but decided against it , in part to remain focused on redistricting . He said \u201c we should have won \u201d the Supreme Court race and worried that the presidential contenders weren \u2019 t talking enough about the down-ballot contests that Democrats need to win to reverse the GOP \u2019 s redistricting edge .\nHolder was dismayed that he \u2019 d been the only prominent Democrat to campaign for Neubauer . \u201c I \u2019 m still a little bit wound up about this one , \u201d he told me two weeks after the election . \u201c This should be a wake-up call for us . I felt a little lonely out there in Wisconsin . \u201d",

The Merrill Park neighborhood was once the center of the city\u2019s Irish political machine, filled with stately Victorian houses\u2014including the childhood home of Spencer Tracy\u2014but it was now mostly African American and economically depressed.\n\nHolder had dressed down from his usual suit and tie: He wore a black fleece jacket, white button-down, and dark blue jeans. He was warmly greeted by Angela Lang, the 29-year-old executive director of Black Leaders Organ\u00adizing for Communities (BLOC), a local group that works to increase voter turnout in Milwaukee\u2019s black neighborhoods from an office in the union hall\u2019s basement, which was filled with campaign flyers and maps. It was the 68-year-old former attorney general\u2019s third visit to Milwaukee in a year, and Lang addressed him as \u201cour No. 1 cousin.\u201d\n\nThe reason for Holder\u2019s visits was Wisconsin\u2019s assault on voting rights. The Wisconsin GOP had passed a voter ID law, designed to depress Democratic participation, that took effect before the 2016 election. As a result, turnout in Milwaukee\u2019s black neighborhoods dropped by more than 20 percent.\n\nVideo Eric Holder's Bold Plan to Fix America \ufeff\n\nNot long after the election, Holder launched the Nation\u00adal Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC), a political action committee that aims to unrig the system that has entrenched Republican control of the country\u2019s most important swing states. He\u2019d received the backing of top Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, who in December 2018 folded his own political operation, Organizing for Action, into Holder\u2019s to give the fight against gerrymandering more clout. Now, while other top Democrats are focused on the White House, Holder has set his sights on neighborhoods like Merrill Park and on races like the one he was there to talk about, a state Supreme Court contest that had received virtually no attention outside Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThis state is in some ways ground zero for gerrymandering,\u201d Holder told two dozen BLOC canvassers who would knock on doors that afternoon for the progressive judge running in the race. \u201cLast year they called it a blue wave, and yet you didn\u2019t flip one congressional seat here in Wisconsin. That\u2019s not because you didn\u2019t work hard or people didn\u2019t vote. It was because of gerrymandering.\u201d Republicans had so effectively gerrymandered the state that even when Democrats won 53 percent of the statewide vote in 2018, they took only 36 percent of the seats in the state legislature.\n\nHolder views gerrymandering, which manipulates district lines to benefit one party, as part of a broader struggle for voting rights, since it effectively diminishes the value of certain communities\u2019 votes. \u201cThere is a direct connection between gerrymandering and voter suppression, not only here in Wisconsin but in places around the country,\u201d Holder told me before his speech at the union hall. \u201cIt is not a coincidence that you see the greatest amount of voter suppression in those states where you see the greatest amount of gerrymandering.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Democrats successfully fought these twin efforts at disenfranchisement in the courts. As Obama\u2019s attorney general, Holder led that charge, filing lawsuits against states like North Carolina and Texas that challenged Republican-\u00adbacked laws curbing the right to vote. But this tactic was handed an enormous defeat in 2013, when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in Shelby County v. Holder, ruling that states with a long history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval to change voting laws. Last week, the court struck another blow, declaring that federal courts couldn\u2019t block partisan gerrymandering. Voting rights advocates face not only a hostile Trump administration but a growing number of federal benches controlled by conservatives. As the GOP\u2019s war on voting has intensified, the traditional ways of protecting ballot access are no longer reliable.\n\n\u201cThere is a direct connection between gerrymandering and voter suppression, not only here in Wisconsin but in places around the country,\u201d Holder said.\n\nSo Holder is pursuing a new strategy, trying to elect down-ballot candidates who can deliver fairer maps and voting laws. The NDRC invested $350,000 in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, hoping that a liberal majority on the seven-\u00admember court might strike down any egregious gerrymanders in the next round of redistricting in 2021. \u201cI don\u2019t think that 10 years or so ago, you would have a former attorney general campaigning for a state Supreme Court justice,\u201d Holder told me. \u201cThis is a recognition on the part of the Democratic Party, on the part of progressives, that we need to focus on state and local elections to a much greater degree than we have in the past.\u201d\n\nBut if Democrats are belatedly recognizing this need, few besides Holder are acting on it. He is playing a long game in a party driven by instant gratification and consumed by the mess in the White House. While the party\u2019s presidential contenders are attracting big crowds, donors, and volunteers determined to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020, Holder is focused on 2021.\n\nThe Constitution requires states to redraw their political districts every 10 years. In 2011, after routing Democrats in midterm elections the previous fall, Republicans took control of critical swing states including Wisconsin, drawing electoral maps that cemented their power. Now history is at risk of repeating itself. If Democrats don\u2019t start devoting more attention and resources to state races, Holder warned the BLOC canvassers, 2021 could end up like 2011. The battle for control of state governments will determine the arc of American politics for the next decade, but it is already overshadowed by the 20-some Democrats running for president. Holder is fighting not just a well-funded Republican opposition but also his own party\u2019s narrow focus on the presidency.\n\n\u201cI understand people are going to be legitimately focused on the presidential race, as we should be,\u201d Holder said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be my job to make sure we don\u2019t lose sight of those other races that are going to be extremely important.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, Holder\u2019s strategy was a radical concept within the Democratic Party.

His corner office has views of the Washington Monument and busts of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on the shelves. \u201cMy hope was\u2014and I know President Obama\u2019s hope was\u2014that my being directly involved would give this effort a degree of attention that it might not otherwise have,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t have a redistricting strategy because, for many years, they didn\u2019t need one. They controlled a majority of state legislatures for most of the post\u2013World War II era, drawing electoral maps in twice as many states as Re\u00adpublicans in the 1980s and 1990s. Democrats were sitting pretty heading into the 2010 elections after winning big in 2006 and 2008, controlling more than 60 percent of state legislative chambers.\n\nNever before has a Democrat of Holder\u2019s stature devoted so much attention to such a wonky issue.\n\nThen the GOP launched an aggressive bid to reclaim power at the state level, creating the Redistricting Majority Project (REDMAP) to target state legislative races and put Republicans in charge of redistricting efforts after the 2010 census. The effort was overseen by former Repub\u00adlican National Committee Chair Ed Gillespie and advised by strategists like Karl Rove. \u201cHe who controls redistricting can control Congress,\u201d Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal at the time.\n\nMassively aided by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision that allowed unlimited corporate political spending, REDMAP raised $30 million, including from oil, tobacco, and health insurance companies, three times as much as its Democratic counterpart. Republicans hoped to flip 25 to 30 House seats occupied by Democrats. They ended up winning 63, plus 20 new legislative chambers, giving them control of nearly every important swing state and the power to draw four times as many state legislative and House districts as Democrats. Nearly a decade later, Republi\u00adcans still control every legislative chamber in heavily gerry\u00admandered states like Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nDemocrats had no comparable strategy. And when the party controlled the White House and Congress after Obama\u2019s 2008 victory, it paid little attention to the states. By the end of Obama\u2019s second term, Democrats had lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. \u201cThis has been one of the big failures of our party,\u201d said former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who led the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005. \u201cWe have not paid attention to the importance of redistricting\u2014haven\u2019t put the time in historically.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the great deficiencies of the Obama operation during the eight years he was president,\u201d said Obama\u2019s former chief strategist, David Axelrod, \u201cwas that not enough attention was paid to legislative races.\u201d The president, consumed by the financial crisis and the Obamacare fight, didn\u2019t sustain a political operation that could combat the tea party wave and the GOP\u2019s surgical targeting of state races. Now, Axelrod said, this deficiency is something Obama, a former state senator, \u201cfeels acutely, feels some responsibility for, and wants to help remedy.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi convened discussions during the 2016 Democratic Nation\u00adal Convention about creating a group focused solely on redistricting. The initiative took on new urgency after Hillary Clinton lost the presidential race even as she won the popular vote, re\u00adinforcing the imperative that Democrats regain power at the state level. After the election, McAuliffe, Pelosi, and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer visited the White House to get Obama\u2019s blessing. \u201cIt was the president who said, \u2018I\u2019ll bring Eric in,\u2019\u201d McAuliffe recalled. Obama decided to make redistricting reform a central focus of his post-\u00adpresidency and tapped Holder as his top lieutenant. Obama has hosted fundraisers for the effort, endorsed candidates in races the NDRC has targeted, and used his email list and social media profile to draw attention to the fight against gerrymandering. \u201cIn America, politicians shouldn\u2019t pick their voters,\u201d Obama said in a 2018 video promoting Holder\u2019s group. \u201cVoters are supposed to pick their politicians.\u201d\n\nFor Holder, the cause was personal. \u201cThe right to vote,\u201d he said when he launched the NDRC in 2017, was \u201ca right that has been a part of my consciousness as long as I can remember.\u201d As a 12-year-old in 1963, Holder sat in his basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, and watched on a black-and-white television as Vivian Malone became one of the first black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Twenty-six years later, he would marry her younger sister, Sharon, an obstetrician. Vivian went on to lead a group that registered black voters in the South and worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. She died in 2005, before Holder became the first black attorney general. \u201cHer not being able to see her brother-in-law become attorney general of the United States is one of those really unfortunate things,\u201d Holder told me in Wisconsin, his eyes welling up. \u201cEven thinking about it now, I can get a little emotional.\u201d\n\nMore votes, fewer seats In some Republican controlled states, gerrymandering has made it all but impossible for Democrats to retake assemblies, even when they win a majority of the statewide vote.\n\nChallenging the GOP\u2019s redistricting edge required a multipronged approach: Holder\u2019s group has filed or assisted a dozen lawsuits against gerrymandered maps, supported local candidates whose races had implications for redistricting, and backed state ballot measures to establish independent redistricting commissions. \u201cHe\u2019s a uniting force between the different pieces of the Democratic ecosystem to get onto a shared strategy to rebuild Democratic power in the states,\u201d said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and an NDRC board member. \u201cHaving a central electoral coordinating hub is really important.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 gains in 2018 were impressive. Holder\u2019s group raised $35 million\u2014comparable to what REDMAP raised in 2010\u2014helping Democrats flip about 300 state legislative seats, six legis\u00adlative chambers, and seven governorships. In four states, including Wiscon\u00adsin, Republicans lost sole control of state government, and with it their ability to single-handedly draw new districts. The NDRC targeted 230 state seats held by Republicans, focusing on suburban areas that were changing demographically; Democrats won 60 percent of them. Holder stumped for candidates in 24 states. \u201cWe gave financial support to races that otherwise might not have gotten financial support,\u201d he said. \u201cI campaigned in races that would not have gotten that kind of high-level attention.\u201d\n\nParty control of state legislatures\n\nThough he hoped to elect more Demo\u00adcrats, Holder\u2019s overriding goal was to make the redistricting process less skewed, putting him in conflict with some Democrats who wanted to maximize partisan gain. When New Jersey Democrats proposed giving legislative leaders more power over the drawing of district lines last year, Holder quickly denounced the plan. \u201cI\u2019m here for a fair process, not to gerrymander for Democrats,\u201d he told me.\n\nHolder, who has never run for elected office, is an unlikely public face for a major political campaign. He\u2019s charismatic by the standards of a career lawyer, but no one would mistake him for Obama on the stump, though they do share a love of dad jokes. Still, Holder\u2019s devotion to technocratic details can be an advantage when it comes to the nuances of redistricting. Holder said he viewed the fight against gerrymandering as a \u201cjigsaw puzzle\u201d and delighted in figuring out which pieces went where.\n\nHis efforts in Wisconsin began in March 2018, when the NDRC spent half a million dollars to elect Rebecca Dallet to the state Supreme Court, a huge amount for a state judicial race. Her victory brought Democrats one seat closer to ending the conservative majority on the court, which can rule on state voting laws. To increase African American turnout, Holder\u2019s group funded BLOC, which knocked on 35,000 doors in Milwaukee in the spring of 2018 and helped achieve higher turnout in Dallet\u2019s race in neighborhoods like Merrill Park than in a 2015 Supreme Court race.\n\nHolder returned to Milwaukee last fall to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers, for whom BLOC knocked on more than 173,000 doors in black neighborhoods that statewide political candidates usually bypassed. Evers defeated Gov. Scott Walker by just 30,000 votes, giving Democrats veto power over the state\u2019s redistricting maps in 2021.\n\nHolder also continued the efforts he\u2019d begun as attorney general by taking Republi\u00adcans to court for infringing on voting rights. When Walker refused to hold special elections for vacant state legislative seats in February 2018, Holder\u2019s group sued and won. After the 2018 election, when Republicans cut back on early voting, Holder\u2019s group sued and won again.\n\nWalker criticized Holder\u2019s work in Wisconsin on Twitter several months before the election; after losing, Walker became finance chair of a new group, the National Republican Redistricting Trust, focused on combating the NDRC. \u201cMy role is to counter Eric Holder\u2019s efforts,\u201d Walker tweeted. \u201cHe, with [t]he help of former President Obama, have raised some $200 million that they are using in court and on the campaign trail. Their goal is to secure Nancy Pelosi\u2019s control as Speaker for a decade or more.\u201d Walker dramatically overstated the amount raised by Holder\u2019s group, but it was telling that the former Wisconsin governor\u2014whose party Holder had been desperately trying to catch up with\u2014now thought Holder was ahead of him.\n\nThe question now is whether Holder\u2019s group can lock in and expand the gains made in 2018. Over the next year, the NDRC plans to almost triple its staff to 30, and the absorption of Obama\u2019s vaunted Organizing for Action list will give Holder\u2019s group access to hundreds of thousands of new volunteers to work on state races. \u201cThe single most impor\u00adtant thing that could be done at the grassroots level over the next few years is to make sure the rules of the road are fair,\u201d Obama said on a call with these volunteers in December 2018.\n\nDemocrats are within six seats of flipping state legislative chambers in Pennsyl\u00advania, North Carolina, Minne\u00adsota, Arizona, and Michigan. \u201cWe\u2019re much closer across the country than people think,\u201d said the DLCC\u2019s Post. But the GOP still controls 62 of 99 state legislative chambers nationwide and holds the governor\u2019s mansion and both legislative bodies in 22 states, compared to 14 for Democrats. The bulk of the NDRC\u2019s efforts will focus on five Republican-controlled gerrymandered states: Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Texas, and North Carolina. Gaining seats there will mean targeting districts in conservative exurbs where Democrats came up short in 2018. Mark Gersh, a Democratic redistricting expert working with Holder\u2019s group, said the team is \u201ctrying to figure out whether Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity and behavior might enable us to go beyond the parts we know we can win, because there\u2019s not enough of them. We won all the low-hanging fruit last time.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s momentum, though. The once-wonky issue of voting rights has become a rallying cry for Democrats. In 2018, voters in five states approved ballot initiatives that curbed gerrymandering. When Democrats took control of the House, their first piece of legislation was a sweeping reform bill that called for independent redistricting commissions to draw all House districts. (The proposal died in the Senate after Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on it.) Schumer said in March that the fight for voting rights should be one of the Democrats\u2019 top three issues, alongside climate change and income inequality.\n\nVoting rights are \u201cpart of a basket of issues that are motivating to people who feel like the character of our democracy is being threatened and that democracy itself is being manipulated,\u201d said Axelrod. But Democrats are still in jeopardy of ignoring the state and local races that will determine the country\u2019s voting maps. \u201cOur concern is there\u2019s wall-to-wall coverage of Trump scandals, wall-to-wall coverage of crowd size and presidential announcements, and our job is to continue to make sure people know that the next decade of democracy is on the line in 2020,\u201d said Post.\n\nDemocratic strategists working on down-ballot races say the presidential campaign is siphoning away resources. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to recruit people [to run], it\u2019s harder to get attention to these races, it\u2019s harder to raise money for them,\u201d said Amanda Litman, executive director of Run for Something, which recruits progressive candidates for local offices. \u201cQuite a few of the donors we work really closely with have been hesitant to reengage, either because they\u2019re tapped out from 2018 or they\u2019re waiting for the presidential race to shake out.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategists working on down-ballot races say the presidential campaign is siphoning away resources.\n\nLitman\u2019s group is coordinating with the NDRC to recruit state legislative candidates to run in every district in the 12 states Holder is targeting in 2020, but she said reaching Run for Something\u2019s $3 million fundraising goal this year \u201cis like pulling teeth.\u201d That\u2019s small change for presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who each raised about twice that sum on the first day of their campaigns, but it could make the difference in flipping multiple state legislative chambers, Litman said.\n\nMore money might have changed the outcome of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Lisa Neubauer, the progressive judge backed by Holder, was favored to win. But in the final week of the race, the Republican State Leadership Committee, the same group that bankrolled the GOP\u2019s takeover of the state legislature in 2010, launched a $1.3 million ad campaign for Neubauer\u2019s opponent, Brian Hagedorn, an ultraconservative judge and former chief counsel to Walker. Meanwhile, Republicans made Holder a talking point\u2014a Facebook ad from Hagedorn admonished, \u201cWe can\u2019t let Eric Holder reshape Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court\u201d\u2014and Neubauer called on Holder and other outside funders to stay out of the race. Turnout surged in conservative, rural parts of the state, and Hagedorn won by about 6,000 votes, cementing a right-wing majority on the court through at least 2023.\n\nThe day after the election, Holder spoke at the annual convention of Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. A dozen Democratic presidential candidates were there, and none had campaigned for Neubauer. \u201cIt seems I\u2019m the only one here who isn\u2019t running for president in 2020,\u201d Holder joked. He\u2019d flirted with his own long-shot presidential bid but decided against it, in part to remain focused on redistricting. He said \u201cwe should have won\u201d the Supreme Court race and worried that the presidential contenders weren\u2019t talking enough about the down-ballot contests that Democrats need to win to reverse the GOP\u2019s redistricting edge.\n\nHolder was dismayed that he\u2019d been the only prominent Democrat to campaign for Neubauer. \u201cI\u2019m still a little bit wound up about this one,\u201d he told me two weeks after the election. \u201cThis should be a wake-up call for us. I felt a little lonely out there in Wisconsin.\u201d",
