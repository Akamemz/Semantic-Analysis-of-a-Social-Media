We can now add 'lying after the fact ' to the list . Facing intense questions about the department 's disastrous response to explicit warning signs about the perpetrator , the Sheriff 's office released an indignant statement at nearly 10 pm on Saturday night . The media 's coverage was unfair , the memo suggested , because an inaccurate statistic was being reported for public consumption :\nI 'm not sure it 's a helpful talking point to insist that county sheriffs `` only '' responded to , um , 23 prior incidents involving the killer or his family , as opposed to 39 .

He also rejects the scandalous allegation from other law enforcement officials that multiple county sheriff officers who were on location failed to enter the building while the shooter was still actively spraying students with bullets . We know this is true of at least one officer , who has resigned ; Israel downplays the serious and credible accusation that there were three others as an 'unconfirmed claim .
