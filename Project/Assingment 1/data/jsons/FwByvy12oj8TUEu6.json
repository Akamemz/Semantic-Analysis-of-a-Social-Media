Overlooking it was largely the problem , in the first place .\nTrump won because of a cultural issue that flies under the radar and remains stubbornly difficult to define , but is nevertheless hugely important to a great number of Americans : political correctness .\nMore specifically , Trump won because he convinced a great number of Americans that he would destroy political correctness .\nI have tried to call attention to this issue for years . I have warned that political correctness actually is a problem on college campuses , where the far-left has gained institutional power and used it to punish people for saying or thinking the wrong thing . And ever since Donald Trump became a serious threat to win the GOP presidential primaries , I have warned that a lot of people , both on campus and off it , were furious about political-correctness-run-amok\u2014so furious that they would give power to any man who stood in opposition to it .\nI have watched this play out on campus after campus . I have watched dissident student groups invite Milo Yiannopoulos to speak\u2014not because they particularly agree with his views , but because he denounces censorship and undermines political correctness . I have watched students cheer his theatrics , his insulting behavior , and his narcissism solely because the enforcers of campus goodthink are outraged by it . It 's not about his ideas , or policies . It 's not even about him . It 's about vengeance for social oppression .\nTrump has done to America what Yiannopoulos did to campus . This is a view Yiannopoulos shares . When I spoke with him about Trump 's success months ago , he told me , `` Nobody votes for Trump or likes Trump on the basis of policy positions . That 's a misunderstanding of what the Trump phenomenon is . ''\nHe described Trump as `` an icon of irreverent resistance to political correctness . '' Correctly , I might add .\nWhat is political correctness ? It 's notoriously hard to define . I recently appeared on a panel with CNN 's Sally Kohn , who described political correctness as being polite and having good manners . That 's fine\u2014it can mean different things to different people . I like manners . I like being polite . That 's not what I 'm talking about .\nThe segment of the electorate who flocked to Trump because he positioned himself as `` an icon of irreverent resistance to political correctness '' think it means this : smug , entitled , elitist , privileged leftists jumping down the throats of ordinary folks who are n't up-to-date on the latest requirements of progressive society .\nExample : A lot of people think there are only two genders\u2014boy and girl . Maybe they 're wrong . Maybe they should change that view . Maybe it 's insensitive to the trans community . Maybe it even flies in the face of modern social psychology . But people think it . Political correctness is the social force that holds them in contempt for that , or punishes them outright .\nIf you 're a leftist reading this , you probably think that 's stupid . You probably ca n't understand why someone would get so bent out of shape about being told their words are hurtful . You probably think it 's not a big deal and these people need to get over themselves . Who 's the delicate snowflake now , huh ? you 're probably thinking . I 'm telling you : your failure to acknowledge this miscalculation and adjust your approach has delivered the country to Trump .\nThere 's a related problem : the boy-who-cried-wolf situation . I was happy to see a few liberals , like Bill Maher , owning up to it . Maher admitted during a recent show that he was wrong to treat George Bush , Mitt Romney , and John McCain like they were apocalyptic threats to the nation : it robbed him of the ability to treat Trump more seriously . The left said McCain was a racist supported by racists , it said Romney was a racist supported by racists , but when an actually racist Republican came along\u2014and racists cheered him\u2014it had lost its ability to credibly make that accusation .\nThis is akin to the political-correctness-run-amok problem : both are examples of the left 's horrible over-reach during the Obama years .
