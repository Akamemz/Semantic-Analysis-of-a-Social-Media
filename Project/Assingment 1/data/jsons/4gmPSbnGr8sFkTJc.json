    "content": "In the wake of two mass shootings earlier this month in El Paso , Texas , and Dayton , Ohio , the societal role of video games grabbed a familiar media spotlight . The El Paso shooter briefly referenced Call of Duty , a wildly popular game in which players assume the roles of soldiers during historical and fictional wartime , in his \u201c manifesto. \u201d And just this small mention of the video game seemed to have prompted President Donald Trump to return to a theme he \u2019 s emphasized before when looking to assign greater blame for violent incidents .\n\u201c We must stop the glorification of violence in our society , \u201d he said in an August 5 press conference . \u201c This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace . It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s statement suggesting a link between video games and real-world violence echoed sentiments shared by other lawmakers following the back-to-back mass shootings . It \u2019 s a response that major media outlets and retailers have also adopted of late ; ESPN recently chose to delay broadcasting an esports tournament because of the shootings \u2014 a decision that seems to imply the network believes in a link between gaming and real-world violence . And Walmart made a controversial decision to temporarily remove all video game displays from its stores , even as it continues to openly sell guns .\nBut many members of the public , as well as researchers and some politicians , have counterargued that blaming video games sidesteps the real issue at the root of America \u2019 s mass shooting problem : a need for stronger gun control . The frenzied debate over video games within the larger conversation around gun violence underscores both how intense the fight over gun control has become and how easily games can become mired in political rhetoric .\nBut this isn \u2019 t a new development ; blaming video games for real-world violence \u2014 any kind of real-world violence \u2014 is a longstanding cultural and political habit whose origins date back to the 1970s . It \u2019 s also arguably part of a larger recurring wave of concern over any pop culture that \u2019 s been perceived as morally deviant , from rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll to the occult , depending on the era . But as mass shootings continue to occur nationwide and attempts to stop them by enacting gun control legislature remain divisive , video games have again become an easy target .\nThe most recent clamor arose from a clash among several familiar foes . In one corner : politicians like Trump who cite video games as evidence of immoral and violent media \u2019 s negative societal impact . In another : people who play video games and resist this reading , while also trying to lodge separate critiques of violence within gaming . In another : scientists at odds over whether there are factual and causal links between video games and real-world violence . And in still another : members of the general public who , upon receiving alarmist messages about games from politicians and the news media , react with yet more alarm .\nSubscribe to Today , Explained Looking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle ? Host Sean Rameswaram will guide you through the most important stories at the end of each day . Subscribe on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Overcast , or wherever you listen to podcasts .\nWhat is new , however , is that recent criticism of the narrative that video games lead to real-world violence seems particularly intensified , and it \u2019 s coming not just from gamers but also from scientists , some media outlets , even mass shooting survivors : David Hogg , who became a gun control advocate after surviving the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland , Florida , unveiled a new March for Our Lives gun control initiative in August , pointedly stating in his announcement on Twitter , \u201c We know video games aren \u2019 t to blame . \u201d\nAnd on all sides is a sense that frustration is growing because so little has changed since the last time we had this debate \u2014 and since the time before that and the time before that .\nThere \u2019 s no science proving a link between video games and real-world violence . But that hasn \u2019 t quelled a debate that \u2019 s raged for decades .\nHistorically , video games have played a verifiable role in a handful of mass shootings , but the science linking video games to gun violence is murky . A vast body of psychology research , most of it conducted before 2015 , argues strenuously that video games can contribute to increases in aggression . Yet much of this research has been contested by newer , contradictory findings from both psychologists and scholars in different academic fields . For example , Nickie Phillips , a criminologist whose research deals with violence in popular media , told me that \u201c most criminologists are dismissive of a causal link between media and crime , \u201d and that they \u2019 re instead interested in questions of violence as a social construct and how that contributes to political discourse .\nThat type of research , she stressed , is likely to be less flashy and headline-grabbing than psychology studies , which are more focused on pointing to direct behaviors and their causes . \u201c Social meanings of crime are in transition , \u201d Phillips said . \u201c There \u2019 s not a single variable . As a public , we want a single concrete explanation as to why people commit atrocities , when the answers can be very complex . \u201d\nThe debate over the science is easy to wade into , but it obscures just how preoccupied America is with dangerous media . The oldest moral panic over a video game may be the controversy over a 1976 game called Death Race , which awarded players points for driving over fleeing pedestrians dubbed \u201c gremlins. \u201d The game became mired in controversy , even sparking a segment on 60 Minutes . Interestingly , other games of the era that framed their mechanics through wartime violence , like the 1974 military game Tank , failed to cause as much public concern .\nIn his 2017 book Moral Combat : Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong , psychologist Patrick Markey points out that before concerned citizens fixated on video games , many of them were worried about arcades \u2014 not because of the games they contained , but because they were licentious hangouts for teens . ( Insert \u201c Ya Got Trouble \u201d here . ) By the 1980s , \u201c Arcades were being shut down across the nation by activist parents intent on protecting their children from the dangerous influences lurking within these neon-drenched dungeons , \u201d Markey writes .\nThen came the franchise that evolved arcade panic into gameplay panic : Midway Games \u2019 Mortal Kombat , infamous for its gory \u201c fatality \u201d moves . With its 1992 arcade debut , Mortal Kombat sparked hysteria among concerned adults that led to a 1993 congressional hearing and the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board , or ESRB . The fighting game franchise still incites debate with every new release .\n\u201c Like people were really going to go out and rip people \u2019 s spines out , \u201d Cypheroftyr , a gaming critic who typically goes by her internet handle , told me over the phone regarding the mainstream anxiety around Mortal Kombat in the 1990s . Cypheroftyr is an avid player of shooter games and other action games and the founder of the nonprofit I Need Diverse Games .\n\u201c I \u2019 m old enough to remember the whole Jack Thompson era of trying to say video games are violent and they should be banned , \u201d she said , referencing the infamous disbarred obscenity lawyer known for a strident crusade against games and other media that has spanned decades .\nCypheroftyr pointed out that after the Columbine shooting in April 1999 , politicians \u201c were trying to blame both video games and Marilyn Manson . It just feels like this is too easy a scapegoat . \u201d\nPoliticians have long seized on the idea that recreational fantasy and fictional media have an influence on real-world evil . In 2007 , for example , Sen. Mitt Romney ( R\u2013UT ) blamed \u201c music and movies and TV and video games \u201d for being full of \u201c pornography and violence , \u201d which he argued had influenced the Columbine shooters and , later , the 2007 Virginia Tech shooter .\nVideo games seem especially prone to garnering political attention in the wake of a tragedy \u2014 especially first-person shooters like Call of Duty . A stereotype of a mass shooter , isolated and perpetually consuming graphic violent content , seems to linger in the public \u2019 s consciousness . A neighbor of the 2018 Parkland shooter , for instance , told the Miami Herald that the shooter would play video games for up to 12 to 15 hours a day \u2014 and although that anecdotal report was unverified , it was still widely circulated .\nA 2015 Pew study of 2,000 US adults found that even though 49 percent of adult Americans play video games , 40 percent of Americans also believe in a link between games and violence \u2014 specifically , that \u201c people who play violent video games are more likely to be violent themselves. \u201d Additionally , 32 percent of the people who told Pew they play video games also said they believe gaming contributes to an increase in aggression , even though their own experience as , presumably , nonviolent gamers would offer at least some evidence to the contrary .\n\u201c I find it more plausible that America \u2019 s long-standing culture of gun violence has affected video games ... than the other way around \u201d \u2014game developer Naomi Clark\nOne person who sees a correlation between violent games and a propensity for real-world violence is Tim Winter . Winter is the president of the Parents Television Council , a nonpartisan advocacy group that lobbies the entertainment industry against marketing graphic violence to children . He spent several years overseeing MGM \u2019 s former video game publishing division , MGM Interactive , and moved into advocacy when he became a parent . Growing up , his children played all kinds of video games , except for those he considered too graphic or violent .\nIn a phone interview , Winter told me his view aligns with the research supporting links between games and aggression .\n\u201c Anyone who uses the term \u2018 moral panic \u2019 in my view is trying to diminish a bona fide conversation that needs to take place , \u201d Winter said . \u201c It \u2019 s a simple PR move to refute something that might actually have some value in the broader conversation . \u201d\nDuring our conversation , he compared the connection between violent media and harmful real-world effects to that between cigarettes and lung cancer . If you consume in moderation , he argues , you \u2019 ll probably be fine ; but , over time , exposure to violent media can have \u201c a cumulative negative effect. \u201d ( In fact , studies of infrequent smokers have shown that their risk of coronary disease is roughly equal to that of frequent smokers , and their risk of cancer is still significantly higher than that of nonsmokers . )\n\u201c What I believe to be true is that the media we consume has a very powerful impact on shaping our belief structure , our cognitive development , our values , and our opinions , \u201d he said .\nHe added that it would be foolish to point to any one act of violence and say it was caused by any one video game \u2014 that , he argued , \u201c would be like saying lung cancer was caused by that one specific cigarette I smoked . \u201d\n\u201c But if you are likely to smoke packs a day over the course of many years , it has a cumulative negative effect on your health , \u201d he continued . \u201c I believe based on the research on both sides that that \u2019 s the prevailing truth . \u201d\nThe debate endures because gun control isn \u2019 t being addressed \u2014 and games are an easy target\nLike many people I spoke with for this story , Winter believes that the debate about gun violence has remained largely at a standstill since Columbine , while the number of mass shootings nationwide has continued to increase .\n\u201c If you look at the broader issue of gun violence in America , you have a number of organizations and constituencies pointing at different causes , \u201d he said . \u201c When you look back at what those arguments are , it \u2019 s the same arguments that have been made going back to Columbine . Whether it \u2019 s gun control , whether it \u2019 s mental illness , whether it \u2019 s violence in media culture \u2014 whatever the debate is about those three root causes , very little progress has been made on any of them . \u201d\nThe glorification of violence is so culturally embedded in American media through TV , film , games , books , and practically every other available medium that there seems to be very little impetus to change anything about America \u2019 s gun culture . We can define \u201c gun culture \u201d here as the addition of an embrace of gun ownership and a nationwide oversupply of guns to what Phillips described as \u201c a culture of violence \u201d \u2014 one in which violence \u201c becomes our go-to way of solving problems \u2014 whether that \u2019 s individual violence , police violence , state violence . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s a commodification of violence , \u201d she said , \u201c and we have to understand what that means . \u201d\nNaomi Clark , an independent game developer and co-chair of New York University \u2019 s Game Center program , agreed . \u201c I find it more plausible that America \u2019 s long-standing culture of gun violence has affected video games , as a form of culture , than the other way around , \u201d she told me in an email . \u201c After all , this nation \u2019 s cultural traditions and attachments around guns are far older than video games . \u201d\nIn light of incidents like Walmart \u2019 s removal of video game displays after the recent mass shootings while continuing to advertise guns , the connection between the shootings and America \u2019 s continued valorization of guns feels extremely stark . \u201c We could ban video games tomorrow and mass shootings would still happen , \u201d Cypheroftyr told me .\n\u201c What \u2019 s new about the current debate is that the scapegoat of videogaming has never been more nakedly exposed for what it is , \u201d gaming sociologist Katherine Cross wrote in an email , \u201c with Republicans and conservatives manifestly fearful of blaming systematic white supremacism , Trump \u2019 s rhetoric , or our nation \u2019 s permissive and freewheeling gun culture for the recent rash of terrorism . \u201d\nBecause of the sensitivity around the issue of gun control , it \u2019 s easy for politicians to score points with constituents by focusing a conversation on games and sidestepping other action . \u201c Politicians often blame video games because they are a safe target , \u201d Moral Combat author Markey told me in an email . \u201c There isn \u2019 t a giant video game lobby like other potential causes of mass shootings ( like the NRA [ National Rifle Association ] ) . So [ by targeting games ] , a politician can make it appear they are doing something without risking losing any votes . \u201d\nAnd the general public is often susceptible to this rhetoric , both because it \u2019 s emotional and because it may feed what they think they already know about games \u2014 even if that \u2019 s not a lot . \u201c The narrative that violence in video games contributes to the gun violence in America is , I think , a good example of a bad idea that seems right to people who don \u2019 t look too closely at the facts , \u201d Zak Garriss , a video game writer and designer who \u2019 s worked on a wide range of games , told me in an email .\n\u201c Video games are a global industry , dwarfing other entertainment industries in revenue in markets comprised of gamers from the UK , Germany , France , Japan , the US , and basically anywhere there \u2019 s electricity . Yet the spree shooting phenomenon seems to be seriously and uniquely a US issue right now . It \u2019 s also worth noting that the ratings systems across these countries vary , and in the case of Europe , are often more liberal in many regards than the US system , \u201d Garriss said .\nHe also pointed out that this conversation frequently overshadows the important , innovative work that many games are engaged in . \u201c Games like Stardew Valley , Minecraft , or Journey craft experiences that help people relax , detox after a day , bond with friends , \u201d he said . \u201c Games like Papers , Please , That Dragon Cancer , or Life Is Strange interrogate the harder and the darker elements of the human experience like love , grief , loneliness , and death . \u201d\nIn other words , a conversation that focuses on games and guns alone dismisses the vital cultural role that video games play as art . \u201c Play video games and you can jump on giant mushrooms , shoot a wizard on the moon , grow a farm , fall in love , experience nearly infinite worlds really , \u201d Garriss told me . \u201c If games have a unifying organizing principle , I \u2019 d say it \u2019 s to delight . The pursuit of fun . \u201d\nHe continued : \u201c To me , the tragedy , if there is one , in the current discourse around video games and violence , lies in failing to see the magic happening in the play . As devs , it \u2019 s a magic we \u2019 re chasing with every game . And as players , I think it \u2019 s a magic that has not just the potential but the actual power to bring people together , to aid mental health , to make us think , to help us heal . And to experience delight . \u201d\nBut for some members of the public , games \u2019 recreational , relaxational , and artistic values might be another thing that make them suspect . \u201c If they don \u2019 t play games or \u2018 aged out of it , \u2019 they might see them as frivolous or a waste of time , \u201d Cypheroftyr says . \u201c It \u2019 s easy to go , \u2018 Oh , you \u2019 re still playing video games ? Why are you wasting your life ? \u2019 \u201d\nThat idea \u2014 that video games are a waste of time \u2014 is another longstanding element of cultural assumptions around games of all kinds , Clark , the game developer , told me . \u201c Games have been an easy target in every era because there \u2019 s something inherently unproductive or even anti-productive about them , and so there \u2019 s also a long history of game designers trying to rehabilitate games and make them \u2018 do work \u2019 or provide instruction . \u201d\nAll of this makes it incredibly easy to fixate on video games instead of addressing difficult but more relevant targets , like NRA funding and easy access to guns . And that , in turn , makes it a complicated proposition to extricate video games from conversations about gun violence , let alone limit the conversation around violent games to people who might actually be in a position to create change , like the people who make the games in the first place .\nYet what \u2019 s striking when you drill down into the community around gaming is how many gamers agree with many of the arguments politicians are making . As a fan of shooter games , Cypheroftyr told me she routinely plays violent games like Call of Duty and the military action role-playing game ( RPG ) The Division . \u201c I \u2019 m not out here trying to murder people , \u201d she stressed . But like the Parents Television Council \u2019 s Winter , Cypheroftyr and many of the other people I spoke with agree that the gaming industry needs to do a lot more to examine the at times shocking imagery it perpetuates .\nMany members of the gaming community are already discussing game violence\nMultiple people I spoke with expressed frustration that the conversation about video games \u2019 role in mass shootings is obscuring another , very important conversation to be had within the gaming community about violent games .\nClark told me that the public \u2019 s lack of nuance and an insistence on a binary reading of the issue is part of the problem . \u201c Most people are capable of understanding that causes are complex , \u201d she said , \u201c that you can \u2019 t just point to one thing and say , \u2018 This is mostly or entirely to blame ! \u2019 \u201d\nBut she also cautioned that the gaming community \u2019 s reactionary defensiveness to this lack of nuance also prevents many video game fans from acknowledging that games do play a role within a violent culture . \u201c That complexity cuts both ways , \u201d she told me . \u201c Even though it \u2019 s silly to say that \u2018 games cause violence , \u2019 it \u2019 s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem . \u201d\n\u201c Even though it \u2019 s silly to say that \u2018 games cause violence , \u2019 it \u2019 s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem \u201d \u2014game developer Naomi Clark\nThat culture is endemic to the gaming industry , added Justin Carter , a freelance journalist whose work focuses on video games and culture .\n\u201c The industry does have a fetishization of guns and violence , \u201d Carter said . \u201c You look at games like Borderlands or Destiny and one of the selling points is how many guns there are. \u201d The upcoming first-person shooter game Borderlands 3 , he pointed out , boasts \u201c over a billion \u201d different guns from its 12 fictional weapons manufacturers , all of which tout special perks to get players to try their guns . These perks serve as marketing both inside and outside the game ; the game \u2019 s publisher , 2K Games , invites players to exult in violence using language that speaks for itself :\nDeliver devastating critical hits to enemies \u2019 soft-and-sensitives , then joy-puke as your bullets ricochet towards other targets . ... Step 1 : Hit your enemies with tracker tags . Step 2 : Unleash a hail of Smart Bullets that track towards your targets . Step 3 : Loot ! Deal guaranteed elemental damage with your finger glued to the trigger ...\n\u201c There are very few [ action/adventure ] games that give you options other than murdering people , \u201d Cypheroftyr said . \u201c Games don \u2019 t do enough to show the other side of it . You shoot someone , you die , they die , you reset , you reload , and nothing happens . \u201d\n\u201c I know that if I shoot people in a game it \u2019 s not real , \u201d she added . \u201c 99.9 percent of people don \u2019 t need to be told that . I \u2019 m not playing out a power fantasy or anything , but I \u2019 ve become more aware of how most games [ that ] use violence [ do so ] to solve problems . \u201d\nAn insistence from game developers on blithely ignoring the potential political messages of their games is another frustration for her . \u201c All these game makers are like , there \u2019 s no politics in the game . There \u2019 s no message . And I \u2019 m like ... did you just send me through a war museum and you \u2019 re telling me this ? ! \u201d\nThe game Cypheroftyr is referencing is The Division 2 , which features a section where players can engage in enemy combat during a walkthrough of a Vietnam War memorial museum . While she loves the game , she told me the fact that players use weapons from the Vietnam War era while in a war museum belies game developers \u2019 frequent arguments that such games are apolitical .\nAnother game Cypheroftyr has found disturbing in its attempt to background politics without any real self-reflection is the popular adventure game Detroit Become Human , which displays pacifist Martin Luther King Jr. quotes alongside gameplay that allows players to choose extreme violence as an option . \u201c You can take a more pacifistic approach , but you may not get the ending you want , \u201d she explained .\nShe noted , too , that the military uses video games for training as part of what \u2019 s been dubbed the \u201c military-entertainment complex , \u201d with tactics involving shooter games that some ex-soldiers have referred to as \u201c more like brainwashing than anything. \u201d The US Army began exploring virtual training in 1999 and began developing its first tactics game a year later . The result , Full Spectrum Command , was a military-only version of 2003 \u2019 s Full Spectrum Warrior . Since then , the military has used video games to teach soldiers everything from how to deal with combat scenarios to how to interact with Iraqi civilians .\nThe close connection between games and sanctioned real-world violence , i.e. , war , is hard to deny with any plausibility . \u201c When someone insists that these two parts of culture have absolutely nothing to do with each other , \u201d Clark said , \u201c it smacks of denial , and many game developers are asking themselves , \u2018 Do I want to be part of this landscape ? \u2019 even if they have zero belief that video games are causing violence . \u201d\nFor all the gaming industry \u2019 s faults when it comes to frankly addressing gaming \u2019 s role in a violent culture , however , many people are quick to point out that critiques of in-game violence can also come from the video games themselves . In Batman : Arkham Asylum , for example , researchers Christina Fawcett and Steven Kohm recently found that the game \u201c directly implicate [ s ] the player in violence enacted upon the bodies of criminals and patients alike. \u201d Other games shift the focus away from the perpetrators to the victims \u2014 for example , This War of Mine is a survival game inspired by the Bosnian War that focuses not on soldiers but on civilians dealing with the costs of wartime violence .\nBut acknowledging that critiques of violent games are coming from within the gaming community doesn \u2019 t play well as part of the gun control debate . \u201c It \u2019 s far too easy to scapegoat video games as low-hanging fruit instead of addressing the real issues , \u201d Cypheroftyr said , \u201c like the ease with which we can get weapons in this country , and why we don \u2019 t do more to punish the perpetrators [ of gun violence ] . \u201d She also cites the cultural tendency to excuse masculine aggression early on with a \u201c b \u201c boys will be boys \u201d mentality \u2014 which can breed the kind of entitlement that leads to more violence later on .\nAll these factors combine to make the conversation around violent video games inherently political and part of a larger ongoing debate that ultimately centers on which media messages are the most responsible for fueling real-world violence .\nThe conversation surrounding violent games implicates violent gaming culture itself \u2014 which , in turn , implicates politicians who rail against games\nGames journalist Carter told me he feels the gaming community needs to , in essence , reject the whole debate entirely because at this point in its life cycle , it \u2019 s disingenuous .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been through enough shootings that you know the playbook , and it \u2019 s annoying that gamers and people in the industry will take this as a position that needs defending , \u201d he told me . \u201c It \u2019 s not a conversation worth having anymore solely on post-traumatic terms . \u201d\nDiscussions about video game violence need to be held mainly within the games community , Carter said , and held \u201c with people who are actually interested in figuring out a solution instead of politicians looking to pass off the blame for their ineptitude and greed . \u201d\nBut some gamers told me they don \u2019 t trust the gaming community to frame the conversation with appropriate nuance . All of them cited Gamergate \u2019 s violent male entitlement and the effect that its subsequent bleed into the larger alt-right movement \u2019 s misogyny and white supremacy have had on mainstream culture at large .\n\u201c The framing of that rhetoric that began in Gamergate as part of the \u2018 low \u2019 culture of niche internet forums became part of the mainstream political discourse , \u201d criminologist Phillips pointed out . \u201c The expression of their misogyny and the notion of being pushed out of their white male-dominated space was a microcosm of what was to come . We \u2019 re talking about 8chan now , but [ the growth of the alt-right ] was fueled by gaming culture. \u201d She points to Gamergate as an example of the complicated interplay between gaming culture , online communities full of toxic , violent rhetoric , and the rise of online extremism that \u2019 s increasingly moving offline .\nGaming sociologist Cross agreed . \u201c At this moment , there is urgent need to shine a light on video game culture , the fan spaces that have been infiltrated by white supremacists looking to recruit that minority of gamers who rage against \u2018 political correctness , \u2019 \u201d she told me .\n\u201c We treat video games as unreal , as unserious play , and that creates a shadow over gaming forums and fan communities that has allowed toxicity to take root . It \u2019 s also allowed neo-Nazis to operate mostly unseen . That is what needs to change . \u201d\nThe resulting shadow over gaming has spread far and wide \u2014 and found violent echoes in the rhetoric of Trump himself . \u201c Look at what the person in the very highest office of the US is cultivating , \u201d Cypheroftyr said . \u201c Toxic masculinity , this idea that men , especially white men , have been fed that they \u2019 re losing \u2018 their \u2019 country . \u201d\n\u201c While video games do not influence us in a monkey-see-monkey-do manner , they do , like all media , shape how we see the world , \u201d Cross argues . \u201c Republicans , in broaching that possibility , open themselves up to the critique that their leader , who makes frequent use of both old media and social media , might also be influential in a toxic way . \u201d\nAnd this , ultimately , may be why the current debate around video games and violence feels particularly intense : The extremes of toxic gaming culture are fueling the attitudes of toxic alt-right culture , which in turn fuels the rhetoric of President Trump and many other right-wing politicians \u2014 the same rhetoric that many white supremacist mass shooters are using to justify their atrocities .\nSo when Trump rails against violence in video games , as he \u2019 s now done multiple times , he \u2019 s protesting a fictionalized version of the real-life violence that his own rhetoric seems to tacitly encourage . If we are to accept the argument that media violence as represented by games is capable of bringing about real-world violence , then surely no media influence is more powerful or full of dangerous potential than that wielded by the president of the United States .\nIn 2018 , Vice \u2019 s gaming vertical Waypoint devoted a week to \u201c guns and games \u201d ; in a moving piece outlining the intent of the project , editor Austin Walker observed that unlike real-world violence , \u201c in big-budget action games , and especially games that give the player guns and plentiful ammunition , violence is cheap and endlessly repeatable . \u201d\nYet now , barely a year later , mass shootings and other incidents of real-world violence have also begun to seem endlessly repeatable . Perhaps that is why , at last , the urgency of shifting our cultural focus from fixing violence in games to fixing violence in the real world feels like it is finally outstripping the incessant debate .",
    "content_original": "In the wake of two mass shootings earlier this month in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the societal role of video games grabbed a familiar media spotlight. The El Paso shooter briefly referenced Call of Duty, a wildly popular game in which players assume the roles of soldiers during historical and fictional wartime, in his \u201cmanifesto.\u201d And just this small mention of the video game seemed to have prompted President Donald Trump to return to a theme he\u2019s emphasized before when looking to assign greater blame for violent incidents.\n\n\u201cWe must stop the glorification of violence in our society,\u201d he said in an August 5 press conference. \u201cThis includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s statement suggesting a link between video games and real-world violence echoed sentiments shared by other lawmakers following the back-to-back mass shootings. It\u2019s a response that major media outlets and retailers have also adopted of late; ESPN recently chose to delay broadcasting an esports tournament because of the shootings \u2014 a decision that seems to imply the network believes in a link between gaming and real-world violence. And Walmart made a controversial decision to temporarily remove all video game displays from its stores, even as it continues to openly sell guns.\n\nBut many members of the public, as well as researchers and some politicians, have counterargued that blaming video games sidesteps the real issue at the root of America\u2019s mass shooting problem: a need for stronger gun control. The frenzied debate over video games within the larger conversation around gun violence underscores both how intense the fight over gun control has become and how easily games can become mired in political rhetoric.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a new development; blaming video games for real-world violence \u2014 any kind of real-world violence \u2014 is a longstanding cultural and political habit whose origins date back to the 1970s. It\u2019s also arguably part of a larger recurring wave of concern over any pop culture that\u2019s been perceived as morally deviant, from rock \u2019n\u2019 roll to the occult, depending on the era. But as mass shootings continue to occur nationwide and attempts to stop them by enacting gun control legislature remain divisive, video games have again become an easy target.\n\nThe most recent clamor arose from a clash among several familiar foes. In one corner: politicians like Trump who cite video games as evidence of immoral and violent media\u2019s negative societal impact. In another: people who play video games and resist this reading, while also trying to lodge separate critiques of violence within gaming. In another: scientists at odds over whether there are factual and causal links between video games and real-world violence. And in still another: members of the general public who, upon receiving alarmist messages about games from politicians and the news media, react with yet more alarm.\n\nSubscribe to Today, Explained Looking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhat is new, however, is that recent criticism of the narrative that video games lead to real-world violence seems particularly intensified, and it\u2019s coming not just from gamers but also from scientists, some media outlets, even mass shooting survivors: David Hogg, who became a gun control advocate after surviving the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, unveiled a new March for Our Lives gun control initiative in August, pointedly stating in his announcement on Twitter, \u201cWe know video games aren\u2019t to blame.\u201d\n\nAnd on all sides is a sense that frustration is growing because so little has changed since the last time we had this debate \u2014 and since the time before that and the time before that.\n\nThere\u2019s no science proving a link between video games and real-world violence. But that hasn\u2019t quelled a debate that\u2019s raged for decades.\n\nHistorically, video games have played a verifiable role in a handful of mass shootings, but the science linking video games to gun violence is murky. A vast body of psychology research, most of it conducted before 2015, argues strenuously that video games can contribute to increases in aggression. Yet much of this research has been contested by newer, contradictory findings from both psychologists and scholars in different academic fields. For example, Nickie Phillips, a criminologist whose research deals with violence in popular media, told me that \u201cmost criminologists are dismissive of a causal link between media and crime,\u201d and that they\u2019re instead interested in questions of violence as a social construct and how that contributes to political discourse.\n\nThat type of research, she stressed, is likely to be less flashy and headline-grabbing than psychology studies, which are more focused on pointing to direct behaviors and their causes. \u201cSocial meanings of crime are in transition,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single variable. As a public, we want a single concrete explanation as to why people commit atrocities, when the answers can be very complex.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the science is easy to wade into, but it obscures just how preoccupied America is with dangerous media. The oldest moral panic over a video game may be the controversy over a 1976 game called Death Race, which awarded players points for driving over fleeing pedestrians dubbed \u201cgremlins.\u201d The game became mired in controversy, even sparking a segment on 60 Minutes. Interestingly, other games of the era that framed their mechanics through wartime violence, like the 1974 military game Tank, failed to cause as much public concern.\n\nIn his 2017 book Moral Combat: Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong, psychologist Patrick Markey points out that before concerned citizens fixated on video games, many of them were worried about arcades \u2014 not because of the games they contained, but because they were licentious hangouts for teens. (Insert \u201cYa Got Trouble\u201d here.) By the 1980s, \u201cArcades were being shut down across the nation by activist parents intent on protecting their children from the dangerous influences lurking within these neon-drenched dungeons,\u201d Markey writes.\n\nThen came the franchise that evolved arcade panic into gameplay panic: Midway Games\u2019 Mortal Kombat, infamous for its gory \u201cfatality\u201d moves. With its 1992 arcade debut, Mortal Kombat sparked hysteria among concerned adults that led to a 1993 congressional hearing and the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB. The fighting game franchise still incites debate with every new release.\n\n\u201cLike people were really going to go out and rip people\u2019s spines out,\u201d Cypheroftyr, a gaming critic who typically goes by her internet handle, told me over the phone regarding the mainstream anxiety around Mortal Kombat in the 1990s. Cypheroftyr is an avid player of shooter games and other action games and the founder of the nonprofit I Need Diverse Games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember the whole Jack Thompson era of trying to say video games are violent and they should be banned,\u201d she said, referencing the infamous disbarred obscenity lawyer known for a strident crusade against games and other media that has spanned decades.\n\nCypheroftyr pointed out that after the Columbine shooting in April 1999, politicians \u201cwere trying to blame both video games and Marilyn Manson. It just feels like this is too easy a scapegoat.\u201d\n\nPoliticians have long seized on the idea that recreational fantasy and fictional media have an influence on real-world evil. In 2007, for example, Sen. Mitt Romney (R\u2013UT) blamed \u201cmusic and movies and TV and video games\u201d for being full of \u201cpornography and violence,\u201d which he argued had influenced the Columbine shooters and, later, the 2007 Virginia Tech shooter.\n\nVideo games seem especially prone to garnering political attention in the wake of a tragedy \u2014 especially first-person shooters like Call of Duty. A stereotype of a mass shooter, isolated and perpetually consuming graphic violent content, seems to linger in the public\u2019s consciousness. A neighbor of the 2018 Parkland shooter, for instance, told the Miami Herald that the shooter would play video games for up to 12 to 15 hours a day \u2014 and although that anecdotal report was unverified, it was still widely circulated.\n\nA 2015 Pew study of 2,000 US adults found that even though 49 percent of adult Americans play video games, 40 percent of Americans also believe in a link between games and violence \u2014 specifically, that \u201cpeople who play violent video games are more likely to be violent themselves.\u201d Additionally, 32 percent of the people who told Pew they play video games also said they believe gaming contributes to an increase in aggression, even though their own experience as, presumably, nonviolent gamers would offer at least some evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cI find it more plausible that America\u2019s long-standing culture of gun violence has affected video games ... than the other way around\u201d \u2014game developer Naomi Clark\n\nOne person who sees a correlation between violent games and a propensity for real-world violence is Tim Winter. Winter is the president of the Parents Television Council, a nonpartisan advocacy group that lobbies the entertainment industry against marketing graphic violence to children. He spent several years overseeing MGM\u2019s former video game publishing division, MGM Interactive, and moved into advocacy when he became a parent. Growing up, his children played all kinds of video games, except for those he considered too graphic or violent.\n\nIn a phone interview, Winter told me his view aligns with the research supporting links between games and aggression.\n\n\u201cAnyone who uses the term \u2018moral panic\u2019 in my view is trying to diminish a bona fide conversation that needs to take place,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple PR move to refute something that might actually have some value in the broader conversation.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, he compared the connection between violent media and harmful real-world effects to that between cigarettes and lung cancer. If you consume in moderation, he argues, you\u2019ll probably be fine; but, over time, exposure to violent media can have \u201ca cumulative negative effect.\u201d (In fact, studies of infrequent smokers have shown that their risk of coronary disease is roughly equal to that of frequent smokers, and their risk of cancer is still significantly higher than that of nonsmokers.)\n\n\u201cWhat I believe to be true is that the media we consume has a very powerful impact on shaping our belief structure, our cognitive development, our values, and our opinions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that it would be foolish to point to any one act of violence and say it was caused by any one video game \u2014 that, he argued, \u201cwould be like saying lung cancer was caused by that one specific cigarette I smoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you are likely to smoke packs a day over the course of many years, it has a cumulative negative effect on your health,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe based on the research on both sides that that\u2019s the prevailing truth.\u201d\n\nThe debate endures because gun control isn\u2019t being addressed \u2014 and games are an easy target\n\nLike many people I spoke with for this story, Winter believes that the debate about gun violence has remained largely at a standstill since Columbine, while the number of mass shootings nationwide has continued to increase.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the broader issue of gun violence in America, you have a number of organizations and constituencies pointing at different causes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look back at what those arguments are, it\u2019s the same arguments that have been made going back to Columbine. Whether it\u2019s gun control, whether it\u2019s mental illness, whether it\u2019s violence in media culture \u2014 whatever the debate is about those three root causes, very little progress has been made on any of them.\u201d\n\nThe glorification of violence is so culturally embedded in American media through TV, film, games, books, and practically every other available medium that there seems to be very little impetus to change anything about America\u2019s gun culture. We can define \u201cgun culture\u201d here as the addition of an embrace of gun ownership and a nationwide oversupply of guns to what Phillips described as \u201ca culture of violence\u201d \u2014 one in which violence \u201cbecomes our go-to way of solving problems \u2014 whether that\u2019s individual violence, police violence, state violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a commodification of violence,\u201d she said, \u201cand we have to understand what that means.\u201d\n\nNaomi Clark, an independent game developer and co-chair of New York University\u2019s Game Center program, agreed. \u201cI find it more plausible that America\u2019s long-standing culture of gun violence has affected video games, as a form of culture, than the other way around,\u201d she told me in an email. \u201cAfter all, this nation\u2019s cultural traditions and attachments around guns are far older than video games.\u201d\n\nIn light of incidents like Walmart\u2019s removal of video game displays after the recent mass shootings while continuing to advertise guns, the connection between the shootings and America\u2019s continued valorization of guns feels extremely stark. \u201cWe could ban video games tomorrow and mass shootings would still happen,\u201d Cypheroftyr told me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s new about the current debate is that the scapegoat of videogaming has never been more nakedly exposed for what it is,\u201d gaming sociologist Katherine Cross wrote in an email, \u201cwith Republicans and conservatives manifestly fearful of blaming systematic white supremacism, Trump\u2019s rhetoric, or our nation\u2019s permissive and freewheeling gun culture for the recent rash of terrorism.\u201d\n\nBecause of the sensitivity around the issue of gun control, it\u2019s easy for politicians to score points with constituents by focusing a conversation on games and sidestepping other action. \u201cPoliticians often blame video games because they are a safe target,\u201d Moral Combat author Markey told me in an email. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a giant video game lobby like other potential causes of mass shootings (like the NRA [National Rifle Association]). So [by targeting games], a politician can make it appear they are doing something without risking losing any votes.\u201d\n\nAnd the general public is often susceptible to this rhetoric, both because it\u2019s emotional and because it may feed what they think they already know about games \u2014 even if that\u2019s not a lot. \u201cThe narrative that violence in video games contributes to the gun violence in America is, I think, a good example of a bad idea that seems right to people who don\u2019t look too closely at the facts,\u201d Zak Garriss, a video game writer and designer who\u2019s worked on a wide range of games, told me in an email.\n\n\u201cVideo games are a global industry, dwarfing other entertainment industries in revenue in markets comprised of gamers from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, the US, and basically anywhere there\u2019s electricity. Yet the spree shooting phenomenon seems to be seriously and uniquely a US issue right now. It\u2019s also worth noting that the ratings systems across these countries vary, and in the case of Europe, are often more liberal in many regards than the US system,\u201d Garriss said.\n\nHe also pointed out that this conversation frequently overshadows the important, innovative work that many games are engaged in. \u201cGames like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, or Journey craft experiences that help people relax, detox after a day, bond with friends,\u201d he said. \u201cGames like Papers, Please, That Dragon Cancer, or Life Is Strange interrogate the harder and the darker elements of the human experience like love, grief, loneliness, and death.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a conversation that focuses on games and guns alone dismisses the vital cultural role that video games play as art. \u201cPlay video games and you can jump on giant mushrooms, shoot a wizard on the moon, grow a farm, fall in love, experience nearly infinite worlds really,\u201d Garriss told me. \u201cIf games have a unifying organizing principle, I\u2019d say it\u2019s to delight. The pursuit of fun.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cTo me, the tragedy, if there is one, in the current discourse around video games and violence, lies in failing to see the magic happening in the play. As devs, it\u2019s a magic we\u2019re chasing with every game. And as players, I think it\u2019s a magic that has not just the potential but the actual power to bring people together, to aid mental health, to make us think, to help us heal. And to experience delight.\u201d\n\nBut for some members of the public, games\u2019 recreational, relaxational, and artistic values might be another thing that make them suspect. \u201cIf they don\u2019t play games or \u2018aged out of it,\u2019 they might see them as frivolous or a waste of time,\u201d Cypheroftyr says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to go, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re still playing video games? Why are you wasting your life?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat idea \u2014 that video games are a waste of time \u2014 is another longstanding element of cultural assumptions around games of all kinds, Clark, the game developer, told me. \u201cGames have been an easy target in every era because there\u2019s something inherently unproductive or even anti-productive about them, and so there\u2019s also a long history of game designers trying to rehabilitate games and make them \u2018do work\u2019 or provide instruction.\u201d\n\nAll of this makes it incredibly easy to fixate on video games instead of addressing difficult but more relevant targets, like NRA funding and easy access to guns. And that, in turn, makes it a complicated proposition to extricate video games from conversations about gun violence, let alone limit the conversation around violent games to people who might actually be in a position to create change, like the people who make the games in the first place.\n\nYet what\u2019s striking when you drill down into the community around gaming is how many gamers agree with many of the arguments politicians are making. As a fan of shooter games, Cypheroftyr told me she routinely plays violent games like Call of Duty and the military action role-playing game (RPG) The Division. \u201cI\u2019m not out here trying to murder people,\u201d she stressed. But like the Parents Television Council\u2019s Winter, Cypheroftyr and many of the other people I spoke with agree that the gaming industry needs to do a lot more to examine the at times shocking imagery it perpetuates.\n\nMany members of the gaming community are already discussing game violence\n\nMultiple people I spoke with expressed frustration that the conversation about video games\u2019 role in mass shootings is obscuring another, very important conversation to be had within the gaming community about violent games.\n\nClark told me that the public\u2019s lack of nuance and an insistence on a binary reading of the issue is part of the problem. \u201cMost people are capable of understanding that causes are complex,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you can\u2019t just point to one thing and say, \u2018This is mostly or entirely to blame!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she also cautioned that the gaming community\u2019s reactionary defensiveness to this lack of nuance also prevents many video game fans from acknowledging that games do play a role within a violent culture. \u201cThat complexity cuts both ways,\u201d she told me. \u201cEven though it\u2019s silly to say that \u2018games cause violence,\u2019 it\u2019s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s silly to say that \u2018games cause violence,\u2019 it\u2019s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem\u201d \u2014game developer Naomi Clark\n\nThat culture is endemic to the gaming industry, added Justin Carter, a freelance journalist whose work focuses on video games and culture.\n\n\u201cThe industry does have a fetishization of guns and violence,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYou look at games like Borderlands or Destiny and one of the selling points is how many guns there are.\u201d The upcoming first-person shooter game Borderlands 3, he pointed out, boasts \u201cover a billion\u201d different guns from its 12 fictional weapons manufacturers, all of which tout special perks to get players to try their guns. These perks serve as marketing both inside and outside the game; the game\u2019s publisher, 2K Games, invites players to exult in violence using language that speaks for itself:\n\nDeliver devastating critical hits to enemies\u2019 soft-and-sensitives, then joy-puke as your bullets ricochet towards other targets. ... Step 1: Hit your enemies with tracker tags. Step 2: Unleash a hail of Smart Bullets that track towards your targets. Step 3: Loot! Deal guaranteed elemental damage with your finger glued to the trigger ...\n\n\u201cThere are very few [action/adventure] games that give you options other than murdering people,\u201d Cypheroftyr said. \u201cGames don\u2019t do enough to show the other side of it. You shoot someone, you die, they die, you reset, you reload, and nothing happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that if I shoot people in a game it\u2019s not real,\u201d she added. \u201c99.9 percent of people don\u2019t need to be told that. I\u2019m not playing out a power fantasy or anything, but I\u2019ve become more aware of how most games [that] use violence [do so] to solve problems.\u201d\n\nAn insistence from game developers on blithely ignoring the potential political messages of their games is another frustration for her. \u201cAll these game makers are like, there\u2019s no politics in the game. There\u2019s no message. And I\u2019m like ... did you just send me through a war museum and you\u2019re telling me this?!\u201d\n\nThe game Cypheroftyr is referencing is The Division 2, which features a section where players can engage in enemy combat during a walkthrough of a Vietnam War memorial museum. While she loves the game, she told me the fact that players use weapons from the Vietnam War era while in a war museum belies game developers\u2019 frequent arguments that such games are apolitical.\n\nAnother game Cypheroftyr has found disturbing in its attempt to background politics without any real self-reflection is the popular adventure game Detroit Become Human, which displays pacifist Martin Luther King Jr. quotes alongside gameplay that allows players to choose extreme violence as an option. \u201cYou can take a more pacifistic approach, but you may not get the ending you want,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe noted, too, that the military uses video games for training as part of what\u2019s been dubbed the \u201cmilitary-entertainment complex,\u201d with tactics involving shooter games that some ex-soldiers have referred to as \u201cmore like brainwashing than anything.\u201d The US Army began exploring virtual training in 1999 and began developing its first tactics game a year later. The result, Full Spectrum Command, was a military-only version of 2003\u2019s Full Spectrum Warrior. Since then, the military has used video games to teach soldiers everything from how to deal with combat scenarios to how to interact with Iraqi civilians.\n\nThe close connection between games and sanctioned real-world violence, i.e., war, is hard to deny with any plausibility. \u201cWhen someone insists that these two parts of culture have absolutely nothing to do with each other,\u201d Clark said, \u201cit smacks of denial, and many game developers are asking themselves, \u2018Do I want to be part of this landscape?\u2019 even if they have zero belief that video games are causing violence.\u201d\n\nFor all the gaming industry\u2019s faults when it comes to frankly addressing gaming\u2019s role in a violent culture, however, many people are quick to point out that critiques of in-game violence can also come from the video games themselves. In Batman: Arkham Asylum, for example, researchers Christina Fawcett and Steven Kohm recently found that the game \u201cdirectly implicate[s] the player in violence enacted upon the bodies of criminals and patients alike.\u201d Other games shift the focus away from the perpetrators to the victims \u2014 for example, This War of Mine is a survival game inspired by the Bosnian War that focuses not on soldiers but on civilians dealing with the costs of wartime violence.\n\nBut acknowledging that critiques of violent games are coming from within the gaming community doesn\u2019t play well as part of the gun control debate. \u201cIt\u2019s far too easy to scapegoat video games as low-hanging fruit instead of addressing the real issues,\u201d Cypheroftyr said, \u201clike the ease with which we can get weapons in this country, and why we don\u2019t do more to punish the perpetrators [of gun violence].\u201d She also cites the cultural tendency to excuse masculine aggression early on with a \u201cb\u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentality \u2014 which can breed the kind of entitlement that leads to more violence later on.\n\nAll these factors combine to make the conversation around violent video games inherently political and part of a larger ongoing debate that ultimately centers on which media messages are the most responsible for fueling real-world violence.\n\nThe conversation surrounding violent games implicates violent gaming culture itself \u2014 which, in turn, implicates politicians who rail against games\n\nGames journalist Carter told me he feels the gaming community needs to, in essence, reject the whole debate entirely because at this point in its life cycle, it\u2019s disingenuous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through enough shootings that you know the playbook, and it\u2019s annoying that gamers and people in the industry will take this as a position that needs defending,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation worth having anymore solely on post-traumatic terms.\u201d\n\nDiscussions about video game violence need to be held mainly within the games community, Carter said, and held \u201cwith people who are actually interested in figuring out a solution instead of politicians looking to pass off the blame for their ineptitude and greed.\u201d\n\nBut some gamers told me they don\u2019t trust the gaming community to frame the conversation with appropriate nuance. All of them cited Gamergate\u2019s violent male entitlement and the effect that its subsequent bleed into the larger alt-right movement\u2019s misogyny and white supremacy have had on mainstream culture at large.\n\n\u201cThe framing of that rhetoric that began in Gamergate as part of the \u2018low\u2019 culture of niche internet forums became part of the mainstream political discourse,\u201d criminologist Phillips pointed out. \u201cThe expression of their misogyny and the notion of being pushed out of their white male-dominated space was a microcosm of what was to come. We\u2019re talking about 8chan now, but [the growth of the alt-right] was fueled by gaming culture.\u201d She points to Gamergate as an example of the complicated interplay between gaming culture, online communities full of toxic, violent rhetoric, and the rise of online extremism that\u2019s increasingly moving offline.\n\nGaming sociologist Cross agreed. \u201cAt this moment, there is urgent need to shine a light on video game culture, the fan spaces that have been infiltrated by white supremacists looking to recruit that minority of gamers who rage against \u2018political correctness,\u2019\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cWe treat video games as unreal, as unserious play, and that creates a shadow over gaming forums and fan communities that has allowed toxicity to take root. It\u2019s also allowed neo-Nazis to operate mostly unseen. That is what needs to change.\u201d\n\nThe resulting shadow over gaming has spread far and wide \u2014 and found violent echoes in the rhetoric of Trump himself. \u201cLook at what the person in the very highest office of the US is cultivating,\u201d Cypheroftyr said. \u201cToxic masculinity, this idea that men, especially white men, have been fed that they\u2019re losing \u2018their\u2019 country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile video games do not influence us in a monkey-see-monkey-do manner, they do, like all media, shape how we see the world,\u201d Cross argues. \u201cRepublicans, in broaching that possibility, open themselves up to the critique that their leader, who makes frequent use of both old media and social media, might also be influential in a toxic way.\u201d\n\nAnd this, ultimately, may be why the current debate around video games and violence feels particularly intense: The extremes of toxic gaming culture are fueling the attitudes of toxic alt-right culture, which in turn fuels the rhetoric of President Trump and many other right-wing politicians \u2014 the same rhetoric that many white supremacist mass shooters are using to justify their atrocities.\n\nSo when Trump rails against violence in video games, as he\u2019s now done multiple times, he\u2019s protesting a fictionalized version of the real-life violence that his own rhetoric seems to tacitly encourage. If we are to accept the argument that media violence as represented by games is capable of bringing about real-world violence, then surely no media influence is more powerful or full of dangerous potential than that wielded by the president of the United States.\n\nIn 2018, Vice\u2019s gaming vertical Waypoint devoted a week to \u201cguns and games\u201d; in a moving piece outlining the intent of the project, editor Austin Walker observed that unlike real-world violence, \u201cin big-budget action games, and especially games that give the player guns and plentiful ammunition, violence is cheap and endlessly repeatable.\u201d\n\nYet now, barely a year later, mass shootings and other incidents of real-world violence have also begun to seem endlessly repeatable. Perhaps that is why, at last, the urgency of shifting our cultural focus from fixing violence in games to fixing violence in the real world feels like it is finally outstripping the incessant debate.",
