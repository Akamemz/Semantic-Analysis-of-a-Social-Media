In fairness , in 2016 , more than 1,700 filed . But ...\n-One of them is President Trump . He 's not only already set up a reelection committee earlier maybe than anyone in history , but his campaign released the first ad of the 2020 cycle . Remarkably , it 's touting what he 's accomplished \u2014 in his first 100 days ( ! ) .There 's already been a flap about stations not running it because of a falsehood in it .\nTrump 's election may have been a threshold moment in presidential politics , opening the door for anyone to run or at least think about it , who might not have before . Becoming president is no longer about the ascendancy of current officerholders or lifelong public servants . That experience is no longer a prerequisite . Now , wealth , power and celebrity not only have a door open for access , but for the possibility of themselves being in charge . It 's atypical for Washington and more like what 's seen in Hollywood or major financial centers , like New York or London .\nIt 's , in part , the evolution of decades of disengagement from the American public , more interested in celebrity than the policy-wonk world of Washington . Presidential elections have become treated like reality shows , giving presidential candidates outsize attention compared to the actual power they have , while lower-level , closer-to-home elections and civic engagement get far less attention from voters and the media . The consequences of that are not yet known , but already what 's emerged is activists dominating .\nFor 2020 , people are already taking steps to be part of the conversation . And the list below reflects the new reality . It 's a who 's who of politics , business and , yes , even one outright Hollywood actor with no political experience .\nSome people , not of the 129 , who have been making noise ...\n-Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg was on a tractor , feeding baby cows , eating cheese curds , holding kittens , talking to cops , firemen and military leaders . He even ditched the hoodie for a suit in a black church . He posted it all to his Facebook page . Seriously . There 's been plenty of speculation about Zuckerberg and campaign-like writings he 's done recently . Asked by Buzzfeed if he has plans to run , he said , `` No . '' But when pressed if he 'd explicitly rule it out , `` Zuckerberg did not immediately respond , '' Buzzfeed wrote .\n-He 's not the only CEO being talked about \u2014 Disney 's Bob Iger is reportedly being `` pelted with entreaties to run . '' His contract with Disney happens to expire in July 2019 . Perfect timing . And ...\n-When Howard Schultz stepped down as CEO of Starbucks in December , there was all kinds of speculation that he 'd run for president ( see : here , here , and here ) . In his farewell to his employees and investors , he talked of `` rising nationalism , '' `` shared values '' and the need to build `` a great and enduring America . '' He said : `` We 're living in a fragile world . There 's a need for more passionate government . ''\nIn 2016 , he told CNN , `` never say never '' to a run .\n-Former Vice President Joe Biden was in New Hampshire this week . `` Guys , I 'm not running , '' he insisted . Maybe he just likes the spring foliage ?\nStill , Biden 's making lots of stops that are raising eyebrows \u2014 he 's speaking at a Florida Democratic fundraiser , making several commencement speeches and said at a conference in San Diego : `` I do n't plan on running , but everybody says because I wo n't commit that I will not run under any circumstances , that means I 'm running . '' And remember , Biden teased tongue-in-cheek in December : `` I 'm going to run in 2020 \u2014 for president . What the hell , man , anyway . ''\n-Elizabeth Warren has been on a book tour . She not only trash talked Republicans but Democrats , too . As for 2020 , she told NPR 's Audie Cornish , `` I do n't have any plan to do that . '' No plans ... OK . When Matt Lauer told her on NBC 's Today Show that people are printing , `` She persisted '' bumper stickers , she just smiled and remained silent .\n-Bernie Sanders was also on tour with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez . He was mobbed by adoring fans , which he seemed to like , but there were some awkward moments that show he 's still not quite willing to get in line with the establishment .\n-Kirsten Gillibrand , who replaced Hillary Clinton in the Senate , ruled out running in 2020 . But is that ironclad ? Asked about 2020 in Upstate New York , the New York senator said , `` Well , I 'm dedicated to serving our state as our senator , and I 'm running for re-election , so I can continue to be their senator . '' Asked if she 's ruling it out , she said : `` I 'm focused entirely on running for Senate , so yes , I 'm ruling it out . '' What happens when or if that focus changes ? Here 's the thing : she needs to win reelection in 2018 before she could even think about going public with plans to run for president . She was rumored shortly after the 2016 election to be reaching out to Clinton donors .\n-Ohio Gov . John Kasich is also selling books . Asked on CNN if he 's running for president again , Kasich said , `` No , no , no . '' Buuuut ... `` You do n't close the door on anything , '' he added .\n-Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota is also part of the book club . He has a book coming out at the end of the month , Al Franken , Giant of the Senate . Him running `` is n't as crazy as you might think '' and `` is n't a joke , '' others have written . There 's already a `` Draft Franken 2020 '' site . But he told a Minnesota radio show , `` First of all , I 'm not running for president . I think that normally what senators do is to enter the presidential race , then lose very quickly and run for the Senate . That seems to be how it works . '' He bluntly said , `` No , '' he is n't running . Yet ... his forceful questioning in hearings has raised his profile . `` It 's very clear now that he is trying to raise his profile and position himself as a leading critic of Donald Trump , '' Jim Manley , a former top aide to former Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , told The Hill .\n-The Rock , yes , The Rock , is on the cover of National Review as `` The Celebrity We Need , '' written by someone else who almost ran for president in 2016 . And before you dismiss a celebrity actor formerly involved with wrestling , look at the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .\n-Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper told NPR 's Wait Wait Do n't Tell Me game show that he might be open to a run . `` Two years from now , if everyone else is running , then we 'll see , '' he said .\nOthers come up , but they 're not likely to run ( this time ) ...\n-Hillary Clinton is setting up a PAC and writing a book . But no one expects she 'd run . This week , though , she noted how close she was to winning .\n-Michelle Obama is super popular . But she says no chance she 's running . `` No , No . No , '' she told Oprah . `` Look , that 's one thing I do n't do , I do n't make stuff up , I 'm not coy . I have n't proven that . I 'm pretty direct \u2014 if I were interested in it , I 'd say it . I do n't believe in playing games . ... People do n't really understand how hard this is .
