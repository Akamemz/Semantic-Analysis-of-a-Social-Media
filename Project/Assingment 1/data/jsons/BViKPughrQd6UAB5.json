'' asked one expert .\nRobert Cohen / AP Devation Powell , the father of slain 3-year-old Kennedi Powell , hugs his cousin Shylar Roberts , 5 , near where Kennedi was shot , in St. Louis on June 10 . Sharonda Edmondson , Kennedi 's great-aunt , sits next to them .\nOn Monday , students at a St. Louis elementary school held a moment of silence for their 8-year-old classmate , Jurnee Thompson , who was shot and killed outside a restaurant after a football game . Over the weekend , other children attended the funeral of Xavier Usanga , a 7-year-old who died after a bullet pierced his throat while he was playing with his sisters in their backyard . Since April , at least 13 black kids and teenagers in the city of St. Louis have died as a result of gunfire in what has been one of the deadliest and most violent summers for young people in the city in years . So many children have have been shot and killed in such a short time that police are offering $ 100,000 \u2014 $ 25,000 for four cases involving a child under 10 \u2014 until Sept. 1 for any information to help solve some of the cases . Officials have arrested only one suspect in the string of killings , with police begging the community for help at a press conference Saturday . St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson explained that the short time window in which tipsters could claim the reward money `` expresses the urgency of the situation . '' \u201c This is urgent , \u201d said Mayor Krewson , telling the crowd how `` reckless gun violence '' claimed the life of 8-year-old Thompson , who was shot in the head while standing next to her family , waiting for their food . `` We are all at risk when these suspects remain on the street , '' she urged . `` If you are as outraged as I am ... please help . '' Federal data ranks St. Louis as one of the most violent cities in the US , with a murder rate that has hovered between 186 and 205 since 2015 , one of the highest in the country . As of Monday , police had recorded 134 homicide cases in 2019 ; guns were used in nearly all of them . The murder rate in East St. Louis , which has a population of about 26,000 , is 19 times higher than the national average . More than 95 % of the residents are black and the majority of families live in poverty . The Belleville News Democrat compiled data from 2000 to 2018 and found that 83 % of 410 murders with a cause of death were gun-related . More than 90 % of the victims were black and 75 % of homicides were never solved . However , experts say that because the victims are black and lower-income , their stories do not permeate the national conversation when it comes to gun violence . `` When looking at coverage of issues like gun violence , we ca n't ignore the systemic issues that disproportionately affect black and brown people , '' said Martin Reynolds , co-executive director of the Maynard Institute , which advocates for diversity in the news media . Ignoring how race , socioeconomic status , and lack of opportunity have lead to `` disproportionate amounts of gun violence in communities '' like St. Louis is part of the problem , Reynolds told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` How would this series of horrific shootings of children and teens be covered by journalists if this violence happened in a white , middle class neighborhood ? '' he asked . `` It would be cast , as it should be , as a public health crisis and a system in need of structural change . '' As gun violence has intensified , ripping through barbecues , family gatherings , and football games , more and more children have been caught in the crossfire . In 2016 , 12 children in the St. Louis metro area died in shootings . In 2017 , that number jumped to 19 . So far this year , 18 kids are dead as a result of gunfire , according to data compiled by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . `` Ask anyone in this city about this and they will tell you that we are going through an extreme time , '' Meredith Pierce , a spokesperson for the St. Louis Public Schools , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday . `` This has been a more violent time than I can ever remember , and I 've been at this job for six and a half years . It 's been horrible . '' The school district has lost nine current and former students this year : football players , second-graders , first-year high school students , 16-year-olds . It has three crisis teams that it sends to campuses to help students and teachers process losing a child to gun violence . Counselors visited two separate schools to provide comfort and mental health resources Monday , Pierce said . The victims range in age . Six of the victims died before their eleventh birthday . Five others will never graduate from high school , according to data from St. Louis Police , which classifies a `` juvenile '' as under the age of 17 .\nThey have been shot playing outside , sitting on their front porches , eating pizza , walking home , standing near a restaurant .
