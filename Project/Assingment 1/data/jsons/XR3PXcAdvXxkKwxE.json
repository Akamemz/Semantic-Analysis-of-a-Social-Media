    "content": "Indianapolis ( CNN ) After a decisive win in Wisconsin , Ted Cruz triumphantly declared that his political fortunes were shifting : `` Tonight is a turning point , '' the Texas senator boomed at a victory rally in Milwaukee .\nBut just a month later , his quest to stop Donald Trump collapsed .\nCruz lost seven consecutive primaries , culminating with Tuesday 's defeat in Indiana that led him to end his run for the Republican presidential nomination .\n`` Together we left it all on the field in Indiana . We gave it everything we 've got , '' Cruz said Tuesday night . `` But the voters chose another path . and so , with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation , we are suspending our campaign . ''\nCruz 's campaign threw everything against the wall as Indiana became a must-win .\nHe struck a dubious bargain with John Kasich to keep the Ohio governor from campaigning in Indiana -- and failed to effectively court Kasich 's supporters . He hastily announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate -- a move seen as desperate and compounded by failing to send Fiorina to the parts of the state where she could help . Even a highly coveted endorsement from Mike Pence lacked pizzazz -- in a radio interview , the Indiana governor first lavished praise on Trump before saying he would vote for Cruz .\nAnd heading into Indiana , Cruz also suffered from a number of cringe-worthy gaffes . Footage of Cruz referring to a basketball `` ring '' and seemingly failing to notice when Fiorina fell off the stage in front of him trailed the senator as he attempted to break out of his rut .\nFinally , he got mad . Tuesday , a visibly frustrated Cruz let loose an angry tirade against Trump Tuesday morning , calling the New York real estate mogul a `` pathological liar '' and a `` narcissist . ''\n`` He is proud of being a serial philanderer . ... He describes his own battles with venereal diseases as his own personal Vietnam , '' Cruz said\nIn the end , Cruz 's defeat boiled down to this : He never fulfilled his promise to unite the religious right with economic conservatives .\nTen days before Indiana 's primary , Cruz and Kasich announced a potential game-changer : Kasich would skip Indiana to let Cruz have a one-on-one shot at Trump there ; Cruz in turn would stay out of Oregon and New Mexico .\nThen , Cruz overlooked the most important part : Winning Kasich 's voters .\nThe Ohio governor was most popular among the moderate , fiscal-focused voters in the densely populated , heavily Republican donut counties that surround Indianapolis -- especially Hamilton County to the north and Hendricks County to the west . There , he was seen as a version of Indiana 's popular former governor , Mitch Daniels .\nCruz was never a neat ideological fit -- particularly given his penchant for playing up the same social fights over religious freedom and LGBT rights that have battered the popularity of Daniels ' successor , Pence .\nBut his campaign did n't appear to truly court those voters anyway . Instead , the Texas senator spent his time on the trail courting rural , religious voters , and playing defense in urban , industrial areas . He stayed focused on social issues -- with one exception : Cruz borrowed Trump 's attack on Carrier , the Indianapolis air conditioning manufacturer that is shipping jobs to Mexico . That message , though , meant little in the well-heeled donut counties .\n`` Cruz needed to focus more on fiscal issues and national security . Those are the issues that would have appealed to Kasich voters , '' said Jennifer Hallowell , an Indiana Republican strategist . `` I think they perhaps misread the state , or viewed the Republican electorate in Indiana as one-size-fits-all . And Hoosier Republicans are not a monolithic group . ''\nHallowell added of the alliance : `` Kasich voters went running to Trump after that announcement . ''\nComplicating the matter was that Kasich and Cruz downplayed the alliance publicly , making it appear that the campaigns did n't have their act together .\nCraig Dunn , the Howard County GOP chairman and a Kasich supporter , said many of the Ohio governor 's backers approached him and said : `` OK , now who am I supposed to vote for ? '' That , he said , is because they 'd `` heard Kasich say , you can go ahead and vote for me . ''\nDeepening Cruz 's struggles : He 'd tapped into the network of ground troops led by Curt Smith , the head of the Indiana Family Institute . But those volunteers ' focus was on the social issues that Cruz already had covered .\n`` Evan Bayh told me this when I first went to work for him : The key to Indiana is to know that yes , we 're a Republican state and we 're a conservative state , but we 're conservative on money , not social issues , '' said Dan Parker , the former Indiana Democratic Party chairman , of the former Democratic governor . `` And Cruz missed that . ''\nWhen Cruz named Fiorina , the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and one-time presidential candidate , as his future running mate , many local Republicans saw it as a big step toward reaching the party 's members who were still uncomfortable with Cruz and not ready to back Trump .\n`` After it was pretty obvious that the Kasich deal backfired , the next opportunity would have been to have Carly Fiorina spend a lot of time in the suburban areas around Indianapolis , '' Hallowell said . `` She appealed to moderate Republicans and women during the debates , and I think had an opportunity to deliver a message and bring folks on board . ''\nAfter all , Fiorina was an experienced businesswoman who counted Indiana 's former lieutenant governor , Sue Ellspermann , among her strong early supporters . And Trump had a weak business record in Indiana , where he 'd tried and failed to enter the state 's casino business .\nBut Indiana operatives said they were baffled by how Cruz 's campaign deployed Fiorina . Instead of using her as a force multiplier , she largely campaigned alongside Cruz -- and never in the donut counties .\nMonday , Cruz 's campaign finally changed its approach , sending Fiorina to campaign in the key suburbs of Brownsburg , Carmel and Fishers .\nIt was , Republicans said , a repeat of the mistake that was already hurting Cruz 's campaign .\n`` I do n't know if he took donut county Republican for granted thinking they would vote based on strategy or if he does n't know how to message to them in a way that 's fiscal first , social second , '' said Pete Seat , a former George W. Bush press aide who 's now an Indiana Republican strategist .\nAs Trump was going five-for-five a week ago in the East Coast `` Acela primary , '' Cruz was already campaigning in Indiana -- in Knightstown , the home of the gym made famous by the 1986 basketball film `` Hoosiers . ''\nBut he made an awkward rhetorical stumble there , referring to the `` basketball ring '' instead of the rim .\nThe next day , Trump rolled out his biggest Hoosier endorsement : legendary Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight .\nThe contrast was stark and immediate . Friday in Evansville , Knight mocked Cruz in an appearance on `` Fox and Friends '' alongside Trump . `` A guy that would come into this state and think that we played with rings instead of baskets is not a guy that 's very well prepared to do a whole hell of a lot , '' the coach said of Cruz .\nThe episode was damaging because it left Cruz looking like a politician relying on gimmickry -- and with no real response .\nTrump had made an even bigger mistake of his own , touting the endorsement of Mike Tyson , the boxer who in 1992 was convicted of rape in Indianapolis .\nIndiana Democrats wondered why Cruz did n't hit Trump harder over Tyson -- and lump in Knight , who 'd famously declared in 1988 that `` I think that if rape is inevitable , relax and enjoy it , '' and was eventually pushed out of his coaching job after a string of controversies over abuse of players .\n`` Bobby Knight would be very popular with Trump voters , but he 's not very popular with people who actually graduated from IU -- that actually have a degree from Indiana University , '' said Parker . `` Why did n't Cruz put his wife out and say that it 's abhorrent that Donald Trump would accept an endorsement from a person that said , a woman should just sit back and enjoy it ? ''\nTrump kept leaning on Knight as his top Indiana surrogate . And soon , he added more well-known former coaches to the mix : Purdue men 's basketball coach Gene Keady ; Notre Dame men 's basketball coach Digger Phelps and Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz .\nCruz picked up a big Indiana endorsement of his own when Gov . Mike Pence appeared on the show of Indianapolis talk radio host Greg Garrison -- for former DA who prosecuted Tyson -- and said he 'd be supporting Cruz .\nIt was n't much of an endorsement , though . Before even mentioning Cruz , Pence heaped praise on Trump , commending him for drawing attention to Carrier 's decision to shift jobs to Mexico .\n`` I know you ca n't tell a person how to endorse you , but it was an awfully tepid endorsement , '' said Dunn , the Howard County Republican chairman . `` He belabored the point with the wonderful , nice things that Donald Trump had done in terms of bringing voters in -- and then , 'Oh , I do n't want to tell people how to vote , but I 'm going to vote for Ted Cruz , but I do n't want to tell people how to vote . ' That 's better than nothing , but not a whole lot better than nothing . ''\nWhile Cruz cut a 30-second TV ad out of the endorsement , Trump once again used what was supposed to be a helpful moment for the Texas senator to mock him .\n`` All the pundits said , 'You know what , I think that was maybe the weakest endorsement in the history of endorsements , ' '' Trump told supporters in Carmel on Monday . `` In the end , they had to re-run the tape just to find out who he was endorsing . ''\nPence made things worse in an interview with CNN 's Dana Bash , when he made clear that he 'd `` support the Republican nominee '' -- Cruz or not .\nThe botched Pence endorsement underscored one of the biggest differences between Wisconsin , the site of Cruz 's last big Midwestern win , and Indiana : In Wisconsin , he had an aggressive ally in Gov . Scott Walker . In Indiana , the only influential supporter he had was -- with his eyes on his own tough re-election battle against Democrat John Gregg -- eager to avoid alienating anyone in his own party .\nAnother big difference between Wisconsin and Indiana : Conservative talk radio .

But in Indiana -- a state where Pence was once the rising talk radio star -- there was no such resistance .\nOn Monday night , Trump packed a huge crowd into one of his signature mega-rallies in South Bend .
