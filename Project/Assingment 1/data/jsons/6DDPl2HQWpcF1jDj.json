    "content": "Moreover , the House committees can be stonewalled by the executive ( although few would have anticipated , I think , the total , run-out-the-clock tactics of the current administration ) . Basketball fans will recognize this as a form of \u201c stall ball . \u201d\nWhat I propose is a kind of \u201c shot clock \u201d remedy that can augment the House investigatory process in light of presidential obstruction . I would favor a statute that provided for fast-track court hearings and expedited appeals as a way of curtailing the tactic of complete refusal to cooperate with requests for documents and testimony under oath before the House oversight committees . If the individuals subpoenaed still failed to comply after a court ordered them to do so , they could be held in contempt with all the political repercussions that would attend such a rebuke . At a minimum , it would be difficult to avoid the inference that something truly odious was being hidden .\nImpeachment needs the legitimacy that the courts can provide , and it also needs timely and sufficient testimony . It simply can not be that an administration can claim that the charges against it are without sufficient evidentiary bases and at the same time prevent the Congress from gaining access to the relevant evidence .\nOne can not expect impeachment to work as designed if Congress does not work at all . But it still serves a useful function .\nFrank O . Bowman III is a constitutional law professor and the author of High Crimes & Misdemeanors : A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump .\nImpeachment is not broken . Congress is broken . Which is a much bigger problem . Nonetheless , impeachment may be able to serve a useful democratic function .\nMidway through the process that will almost surely produce impeachment of Donald Trump in the House of Representatives and his acquittal in the Senate , there are several reasons one might view impeachment as \u201c broken. \u201d The reasons any given observer advances , like so much in our fractured political life , are likely to differ depending largely on that observer \u2019 s political perspective .\nThose who view Trump as having demonstrated in many ways and on multiple occasions that he is unfit for office and a genuine danger to republican government may view impeachment as broken because it will not remove him . People of this view might reasonably ask whether a mechanism incapable of responding to precisely the sort of threat for which it was inserted into the Constitution is of any value .\nConversely , the loyal supporters of Mr. Trump are likely to complain that impeachment is broken because all the inquiries into his behavior are nothing more than vengeful efforts by Trump \u2019 s opponents to overturn the results of the 2016 election .\nBoth sets of complaints are reflections of a deeper malady\u2014our politics is now so fractured that Congress has become increasingly incapable of performing any of its core functions . When the national legislature is unable , year after year , even to debate and pass a budget without histrionic confrontations that shut the government or threaten the nation \u2019 s credit , it is hardly surprising that it can not effectively wield the extraordinary constitutional remedy of presidential impeachment .\nMore particularly , when the Framers wrote impeachment into the Constitution , they made several assumptions about Congress . First , as Alexander Hamilton candidly acknowledged in Federalist 65 , they recognized that impeachment would inevitably summon partisan passions that could overwhelm considered judgment of the facts . But they also assumed some irreducible minimum of public virtue in at least a solid majority of elected public officials , and thus that when confronted by the danger of an obviously unfit and authoritarian president , partisan impulses would be subordinated to public duty . Second , they built the system of inter-branch checks and balances on the assumption that the members of each branch would naturally protect the institutional prerogatives of the branch to which they belonged even against threats to those prerogatives from another branch controlled by their own party . In short , they assumed that members of Congress would naturally resist any president , even one of their own party , if he continually encroached on congressional power .\nNeither of these founding assumptions seem warranted in the present moment . The assumption that Congress would jealously guard its prerogatives against the president has been doubtful for decades , replaced by the dual tendencies to delegate even routine decision-making to the executive branch and to evade politically difficult choices like those involving war and peace . Congressional willingness to stand up for itself has declined still further under Trump and may have reached its historical nadir with the failure to override Trump \u2019 s emergency declaration that he had the right to take for his wall money Congress appropriated for other purposes .\nAnd as for public virtue , at least if that means some minimal devotion to seeking truth and promoting the national interest over partisan advantage , I will leave to the reader the judgment of whether those qualities are on display , and if so by whom , during the current impeachment debates .\nIn short , one can not expect impeachment to work as designed if Congress does not work at all . That said , even a hobbled impeachment process may yet serve a beneficial end . Impeachment remains a powerful tool for investigating presidential wrongdoing and exposing it for public judgment . In the present case , impeachment will almost surely not produce removal of Donald Trump , as in my view the Framers would certainly have expected it to do . But it will , at the least , shed light on his conduct and therefore allow the electorate to judge him in 2020 . That is a genuinely good thing .\nCongress should put uncooperative witnesses in jail\u2014or at least remember that it can .\nMary Frances Berry is the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought and Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania . She is the author of 12 books , including Why ERA Failed : Politics , Women 's Rights , and the Amending Process of the Constitution .\nImpeachment is not broken enough to require the almost impossible effort to amend the Constitution , which was deliberately made difficult to achieve . But given widespread frustration over the process , the House and Senate could make some changes before the next impeachment surfaces . These are simple changes in public relations and procedure which might increase confidence ( even among participants ) in the process , and reduce public polarization .\nThe House and Senate have powers that should be used next time if members believe the issue is serious enough for impeachment . Both chambers can hold witnesses in contempt and keep them under guard until they produce documents or agree to testify , even if witnesses subsequently assert Fifth Amendment immunity by refusing to discuss substance . Last used in 1935 , Congress \u2019 contempt power would be sure to trigger a backlash if used to hold Donald Trump or close associates in jail until they agreed to testify\u2014but it \u2019 s a tool of last resort , and available in dire circumstances like these . A majority of the House or Senate must vote in favor . Obviously , if the House majority is prepared to impeach , it might also get the votes to approve contempt and detention .\nSecond , the House , and afterwards the Senate , should bend over backwards to appear apolitical . That means , for example , not using hearsay testimony to prove statements that the person being investigated made any particular statement . The investigation should not include witnesses to facts who are explaining what someone told them rather than what they actually heard or saw firsthand .

In the United States , most impeached officers have been federal judges but , as we know by now , there have been only two American presidents who have actually been impeached , Andrew Johnson and William Jefferson Clinton . In both cases , the House voted to impeach and then the Senate , per the instructions of the Constitution , put the presidents on trial .\nBut the Constitution is a guideline , not a handbook . It does not define the terms \u201c high crimes and misdemeanors , \u201d which is what seems to stick in the throat of the process . For what are they ? In Federalist 65 , Alexander Hamilton clarified\u2014sort of : a high crime is an abuse of executive authority , proceeding from \u201c an abuse or violation of some public trust. \u201d Impeachment is a \u201c national inquest into the conduct of public men. \u201d Murky : Are impeachments to proceed because of violations of law\u2014or infractions against that thing called public trust ? The answer is both , though it 's absolutely true that the civil officer need not have broken a specific law\u2014to have stolen a chicken , for instance , or have crossed the street against the lights . Rather , the framers of the Constitution were aware that anyone in a position of power must be held accountable for their actions in order to maintain a responsible and good government . To prevent an unprincipled demagogue from acting above the law , the framers thus incorporated impeachment into the Constitution , precisely to prevent corruption from within , keep elections free of foreign powers , and avert obstruction of justice or abuse of power .\nThat 's where we are today , and what the legal scholars before the House Judiciary Committee told us on Wednesday .
