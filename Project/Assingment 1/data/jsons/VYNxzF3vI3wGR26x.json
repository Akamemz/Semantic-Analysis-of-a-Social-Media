Ed Royce , R-Calif. , complained in a letter to Kerry that his committee was not consulted about the payment . The Obama administration claimed the agreement was made to settle a dispute with Iran over $ 400 million in frozen funds that dated back to 1979 . The remaining $ 1.3 billion was described by the Obama administration as `` interest '' .\n`` It is unclear how this $ 1.7 billion payment is in the national security interests of the United States , '' Royce wrote .\nRoyce 's letter included 10 questions to Kerry about the settlement . Among them are how the administration calculated the $ 1.3 billion `` interest '' on the payment , a timeline of negotiations over the payment since this past summer 's nuclear deal , and why the money was not used to `` compensate American victims of Iranian terrorism who have been awarded judgments against Iran . ''\nRoyce 's letter also asks for a list of U.S. officials who participated in negotiations with Iran over the payment , the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement .\nThe White House announced the payment on Jan. 17 , the same day that Iran released five American prisoners , including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian , former Marine Amir Hekmati , and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini .\nAt the time , Obama defended the amount paid by the U.S. , saying it was `` much less than the amount Iran sought . '' The president added that the one-time payment was preferable to letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a judgement from the Iran-US Claims Tribunal , which is based in The Hague and was created in the deal that ended the Iran hostage crisis in 1981 .\n`` I have a larger concern that in choosing to resolve this relatively minor bilateral dispute at this time , the Obama Administration is aggressively moving towards reestablishing diplomatic relations with Iran , '' Royce wrote . `` Such action would clearly violate the President \u2019 s pledge to 'remain vigilant ' in countering the threat Iran poses to the United States and our allies in the region .
