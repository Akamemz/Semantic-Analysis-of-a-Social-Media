Larry Hogan ( R ) signed an equal pay law that advocates are calling one of the nation 's strongest . It strengthens existing laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender , and also includes gender identity .\n`` It really makes Maryland a leader in the equal pay movement , '' said Charly Carter , executive director of Maryland Working Families , in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Carter helped push the bill through the legislature , along with other advocates .\nThe equal pay law comes right on the heels of Hogan signing the Contraceptive Equity Act last week , which makes birth control more consistently affordable . That law goes further than the Affordable Care Act by forbidding insurers from charging any copays on any federally approved birth control , including emergency contraception and vasectomies .\nIt might seem surprising that Hogan , a Republican , would be willing to sign both of these fairly progressive bills that feminist advocates have been pushing for . And the new equal pay law in particular was a hard-fought battle against Republicans who did n't want it passed , or who did n't want it to go as far as equal pay advocates did . But Carter said it 's `` politically smart '' for Hogan to do so , since the measures are so popular with Maryland voters .\nCarter says one part of the law closes loopholes and makes it harder for employers to justify pay disparities between men and women .\nThe law also says you can not forbid your employees from discussing their salaries . It also makes it much easier for workers to sue if their boss unjustly fires or retaliates against them for discussing their pay .\nSome employers either explicitly or implicitly ban the discussion of salaries , because they 're afraid of stoking resentments or revealing inequities . And advocates say that this lack of pay transparency contributes to the wage gap . Unconscious bias means women are frequently offered lower salaries for various reasons , and sometimes employers have no idea that they 're consistently paying women less than men until they conduct pay audits .\nThe way the system is currently set up is also incredibly unfair to low-wage workers , most of whom are women , Carter said . For practical purposes , many of them have little or no legal protection against retaliation . All they can do is appeal to the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) \u2014 a lengthy process that not even all workers can avail themselves of .\n`` If you 're making minimum wage , if you 're making $ 30,000 a year , you do n't have two years and lawyers ' fees to go after your employer for treating you badly , '' Carter said .\nWhere else are laws like these being passed or proposed ?\nA national law that 's pretty similar to Maryland 's , the Paycheck Fairness Act , is going nowhere in Congress \u2014 like most progressive initiatives these days .
