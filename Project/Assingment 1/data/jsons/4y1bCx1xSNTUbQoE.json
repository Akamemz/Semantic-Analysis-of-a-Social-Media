And as many Americans prepare for the traditional Memorial Day kickoff to the summer season , longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills is scheduled to sit for a sworn deposition Friday in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch .\nMills \u2019 testimony would be the first known time a member of Clinton \u2019 s inner circle has been questioned under oath in the email controversy . Another top Clinton aide , Huma Abedin , is set to testify next month . And Clinton herself is awaiting a judge 's ruling on whether she should be required to give a deposition .\nNo matter how that comes out , Clinton also faces an ongoing FBI investigation into the email set up . Some of her aides have already been questioned . She 's expressed a willingness to sit down with investigators \u2014 something they 're expected to take her up on in the next few weeks . Unless it takes place in complete secrecy , such a session would be the highest-profile legal spectacle the former first lady has faced since she testified 20 years ago before a federal grand jury investigating the disappearance and reappearance of Whitewater billing records .\n`` I think the [ Office of Inspector General ] report is going to be of interest and the testimony is going to be out there , '' said Judicial Watch 's Tom Fitton . `` I think the courts will take action this summer .... I do n't see any of this going away . ''\nOn top of all that , there 's an expected House report on Benghazi . And a slew of planned document releases from the State Department that a conservative group is planning to make into a movie .\n`` We have been for months and we will be for the next several months on the receiving end of document productions from the State Department and others , '' said David Bossie of Citizens United , another conservative organization . `` We have been and continue to be in the works on a Hillary documentary .... We 'd like to have something launch on or around the the Democratic Convention . ''\nTrump has also indicated he 's planning to turn up the heat on the issue , once Clinton has finished fighting out the battle for the Democratic nomination with Sen. Bernie Sanders .\nSanders `` didn \u2019 t pick up on the emails , which I think was a big mistake , '' Trump said Sunday on Fox News. `` I \u2019 m going to pick up bigly . Because frankly she shouldn \u2019 t even be allowed to run for president . \u201d\nClinton allies are bracing for the onslaught and have already moved to take the sting out of some of the potential blows .\n`` All of this has been a political hit job from the beginning , '' said David Brock of the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record . `` Whether it \u2019 s the report being written in the State Department \u2019 s Office of Inspector General with the help of a former confidante of Chuck Grassley , at the same time Senator Grassley has been on a political crusade to hurt Hillary Clinton , or the final report of the discredited House Benghazi Committee , we will do as we have from the beginning : preempt , debunk and push back on these partisan lies . \u201d\nEarlier this month , as word spread that the release of the inspector general 's report was nearing , Brock 's group sought to discredit the probe by convening a conference call with reporters . Longtime Democratic attorney Joe Sandler highlighted the complaints of conflicts of interest , charges that the inspector general 's office and Grassley aides have denied .\nThe IG report did provide some cover to Clinton , finding that the agency suffers from `` longstanding , systemic weaknesses '' with records that `` go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State .

''\nClinton 's supporters on Capitol Hill are also at work trying to bolster her case and uncover facts her backers can rely on .\nEarlier this month , three Democratic senators obtained a letter from the State Department suggesting that reports about 2,100 classified emails were found in Clinton 's account may have exaggerated the import of that claim . A top State official suggested there was nothing wrong with Clinton handling about 2,000 of those messages in unclassified channels because they were only classified in order to prevent the release of those messages to the public following FOIA requests .\nState legislative affairs chief Julia Frifield wrote in the letter that diplomats `` routinely '' handle foreign government information on unclassified systems and their jobs essentially require that .
