The account of a tumultuous time is crisp and spare , but the entries quoted from Biden \u2019 s episodic diary betray his mounting anguish .\n\u201c It happened , \u201d Biden wrote at the end , 7:51 PM on May 30 , 2015 . \u201c My God , my boy . My beautiful boy . \u201d\nA son who had escaped death decades earlier , surviving a car crash that killed his mother and sister , had been lost at age 46 .\nNow , feelings of \u201c abject grief \u201d sweep over him less often , Biden told \u2588\u2588\u2588 as he launched his book \u2019 s publicity tour , replaced by a sense that \u201c I can make ( it through ) this , and we can make Beau proud. \u201d At 74 , he stands tall and straight , natty in a navy jacket , with the easy smile and affable manner that prompted fans on social media to nickname him \u201c Uncle Joe . \u201d\nBut his eyes swell with tears as he recounts his son \u2019 s final days , and he pauses a beat to regain his composure . \u201c We kept thinking the science would outrun the cancer , \u201d he says , \u201c and we didn \u2019 t make it . \u201d\nIn the book , Biden reveals that he thought \u201c hard \u201d after he and President Obama were re-elected in 2012 about whether that election should be his last , whether it was time to shift the family \u2019 s focus to Beau \u2019 s political future . The younger Biden had been elected to a second term as Delaware attorney general two years earlier . He would declare his intention to run for governor in 2016 , a race political analysts predicted would be his to lose .\n\u201c I looked down the road and there would be a time in which , if I would continue to run after the vice presidency , it would crowd Beau out , \u201d Biden said in the interview , leaning forward in his chair , recalling his private debate . \u201c I really started to think that I \u2019 ve had all this time ; I love what I do . But is it just too small a pond for two potentially national figures with the same name ? \u201d\nIt was Barack Obama who dubbed Beau \u201c Joe Biden 2.0 . \u201d\n\u201c He had all the best of me , but with the bugs and flaws engineered out , \u201d Biden wrote . In some ways , Beau resembled Obama more than he did his dad . He was savvier about new technologies and more disciplined as a speaker . \u201c Beau didn \u2019 t make many mistakes , \u201d Biden says , laughing at the contrast to his own reputation as , in his words , a \u201c gaffe machine . \u201d\nBeau refused to talk about his long-term aspirations , Biden says , but those around him did . As the commander of allied forces in Iraq , Gen. Roy Odierno had gotten to know Beau during his tour of duty there with the Delaware National Guard . In a eulogy at his funeral , Odierno , by then the Army Chief of Staff , said he had fully expected to one day be saluting Beau as commander in chief .\nHis father had had the same thought . \u201c I did , \u201d he says . \u201c I did . \u201d\nAfter he had been diagnosed in 2013 with glioblastoma \u2014 the most aggressive form of brain cancer , and a near-certain death sentence \u2014 Beau urged his father not to be deterred from running for president in 2016 . So did the rest of the family . But Biden says when the time for a decision was pressing , his grief was too fresh , his family still reeling . \u201c I didn \u2019 t have the emotional energy to do it , \u201d he says .\nIf he could have brought himself to run , he believes he could have gone the distance in what would have been his third bid for the presidency .\nFirst , would he have defeated Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination ? \u201c I think I would have , \u201d he says . \u201c I thought I was best qualified to finish the job that Barack and I had started . \u201d\nSecond , would he have beaten Donald Trump in the general election ? He responds with a slow grin . \u201c The polling data indicated that , and I did not take issue with the polling data . \u201d\nBiden argues that his connection with middle-class voters and the authenticity he projects would have been the right fit in the unpredictable presidential election just past \u2014 and perhaps the one still ahead . When it comes to the 2020 contest , he says it \u2019 s not yet time to make a decision about running , but he leaves little doubt that he wants to think about it when it is time .\nOne factor will be his age and health , and the desire by some Democrats to turn to a new generation of leaders . Biden , who celebrates his 75th birthday next week , would be the nation \u2019 s oldest president ever if elected in 2020 .\nCLOSE Joe Biden would beat President Trump in the 2020 general election\u2026 according to a new Politico and Morning Consult Poll .
