So willing that he got up from his dinner , moved over to sit in private with Vladimir Putin , and joined the Russian leader to chat for an hour with only a Kremlin-provided interpreter as a witness . Did they talk about Syria ? Crimea ? Sanctions ? Clearing up some building permits for Trump \u2019 s buddies the Agalorovs ?\nWe don \u2019 t know . Because Donald Trump thinks so little of the American people , so little of Congress , so little of the responsibilities of his position , that he didn \u2019 t even bother to mention the meeting . He doesn \u2019 t feel the need to produce either a truthful transcript or even the sketchiest alibi . What did they talk about ? Nunya . Now STFU .\nTrump didn \u2019 t bother to tell America what he \u2019 d done\u2014and not one member of his staff lifted a pen or went to a mike to mention that Trump \u2019 s debriefing had extended into hour three , or that the pesky presence of Rex Tillerson and a U.S.-source translator was not needed for the \u2026 good stuff .\nIt \u2019 s not as if Trump tried to cover up his actions . He \u2019 s not in a role where he can stroll over unnoticed . He just flagrantly , openly , in-your-face-ly did it while the leaders of the world looked on .\nThe dinner discussion caught the attention of other leaders around the table , some of whom later remarked privately on the odd spectacle of an American president seeming to single out the Russian leader for special attention at a summit meeting that included some of the United States \u2019 staunchest , oldest allies .\nIf Trump had sat down for an hour of discussion with Theresa May or Angela Merkel , the concerns over the one-sided privacy of affair would be negligible , because the goals of the UK or Germany run mostly parallel to those of the United States \u2026 or should . But Trump chose to sit down with a proudly autocratic bigot and mass murderer .
