New York is just the latest of more than a dozen states figuring out how to balance public health concerns with concluding a Democratic primary .\nNew York Gov . Andrew Cuomo announced the delay at his daily coronavirus press conference Saturday , saying , \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s wise to be bringing a lot of people to one location to vote , a lot of people touching one doorknob , a lot of people touching one pen . \u201d\nThe move will be an easy one , he explained , because the state had a state- and congressional-level primary already scheduled for June 23 .\nBut the choice to delay the Democratic contest could come with consequences . Democratic National Committee rules mandate states that push their primaries to a date after June 9 have their delegates reduced by 50 percent .\nAnd the rules also say any candidate campaigning in a state with a contest outside of the DNC \u2019 s designated primary calendar will not be awarded any delegates from that state . Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden , the last two candidates in the primary race , aren \u2019 t physically campaigning in New York ( or any other state ) , but the DNC defines \u201c campaigning \u201d broadly as being inclusive of but \u201c not limited to \u201d :\nPurchasing print , internet , or electronic advertising that reaches a significant percentage of the voters in the aforementioned state ; hiring campaign workers ; opening an office ; making public appearances ; holding news conferences ; coordinating volunteer activities ; sending mail , other than fundraising requests that are also sent to potential donors in other states ; using paid or volunteer phoners or automated calls to contact voters ; sending emails or establishing a website specific to that state ; holding events to which Democratic voters are invited ; attending events sponsored by state or local Democratic organizations ; or paying for campaign materials to be used in such a state .\nThe DNC further notes its Rules and Bylaws Committee can add to this list and has final say over whether a campaign \u2019 s activities are in violation of this rule . That means that although , for instance , podcasting isn \u2019 t included in this list , Biden \u2019 s new podcast could perhaps be seen as being in violation of this rule , given it is distributed nationwide , including to New York , Louisiana , and Kentucky \u2014 all states that now have post-June 9 primaries .\nIn light of these rules , most states rescheduling their primaries set new dates just ahead of this June 9 cutoff . Pennsylvania , Connecticut , and Ohio , for example , joined a growing list of states holding primaries on June 2 . Other places , like Puerto Rico , cut things a little closer : Its primary will be on June 7 .\nIt is not yet clear whether these rules will be enforced , particularly now that the most delegate-rich state left on the calendar , New York , has chosen a delay .\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said , \u201c We will continue to monitor the situation and work with state parties around their delegate selection plans , and if states move beyond the June 9th window stated in our rules , the Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to discuss and determine next steps . \u201d\nWhat those next steps are remains to be seen . In the meantime , however , the DNC is making it plain that it doesn \u2019 t want states postponing primaries at all .\nThe DNC argues mail-in voting is the solution to the coronavirus voting issue\nFollowing Ohio \u2019 s Super Tuesday III announcement that it would delay its primary , DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement , \u201c States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote , instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable . \u201d\nIn a Sunday USA Today op-ed by Perez and six other Democratic Party leaders , the party expounded upon this point , arguing that states should simply expand their voting periods to at least 20 days before elections \u2014 and their voting hours \u2014 to allow voters to cast ballots in socially distant ways . This would not solve the problem Cuomo cited as his primary concern : that voters risk exposure by coming into contact with high-touch surfaces such as ballot pens and the handles of polling place doors .\nTo that end , the authors also suggest states work to expand their mail-in voting programs , writing :\nStates should automatically mail ballots to registered voters ; voters should be able to mail back those ballots for free or with prepaid postage by the date of the primary ; voters should also be able to drop off ballots at predesignated locations , as is the case in Arizona , or have someone else drop it off for them ; and ballots should be accepted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days of the election .\nAnd the DNC is now committing to helping states pay for these reforms , with the leaders writing , \u201c any state that voluntarily complies with such reforms will receive payments equal to the costs they \u2019 ve incurred . \u201d\nAhead of November , Perez and his colleagues further pressed Congress and the White House to embrace a proposal by Sens . Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden that , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ella Nilsen has explained , \u201c if 25 percent of US states declare an emergency ... would trigger a requirement to allow any voter to vote from home via a mail-in ballot. \u201d All states have done so , which would place the bill in effect if it were to become law as written .\nNilsen noted the bill \u2019 s authors hoped the proposal would be included in the Covid-19 stimulus package Congress passed last week ; it was not , and it won \u2019 t be able to be taken up until at least April 20 , when the Senate ends its current recess , if at all .\nThe ratification of such a proposal would go a long way toward addressing Perez \u2019 s second concern earlier this March , namely that the \u201c timing around the virus remains unpredictable . \u201d\nWhile delays certainly allow states to strengthen \u2014 and in some cases fully develop \u2014 their vote-by-mail infrastructure , it is true that on June 23 or November 3 the United States may still find itself needing to maintain extreme social distancing practices . In fact , many experts say this is likely , and that unless a precise system of testing , surveillance , and tracking is developed , the United States may have to continue to shelter in place until a vaccine is developed , a process that could take until September 2021 \u2014 if not longer .\nThis means that Perez is correct in arguing the delays that have been decided on so far may not enfranchise those who would like to vote but are concerned about contracting the coronavirus . It is important to note , however , delays will re-enfranchise some voters : those infected with the virus during their state \u2019 s primary .\nThis is particularly true in New York . Saturday , Cuomo said the state is likely to see its case peak in three weeks \u2014 that is , right around April 28 , the day it was meant to hold its presidential primary .\nAs of March 30 , the state has nearly 60,000 confirmed cases , meaning more than 60,000 New Yorkers will be at home in bed or in hospitals on ventilators when its original primary date comes around . Not all of that number will be Democrats , but given New York is a solidly blue state , a large number of them will be , and the postponement should allow most of them to vote . Officials hope social distancing measures will force the state \u2019 s case count much lower , allowing more people to participate than would have otherwise been able to .\nPublic health experts like Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci have both said the US can expect confirmed case counts to go up in the weeks to come and that it takes time to see the benefits of social distancing . This would suggest that delaying primaries in general will allow them to be held at a time when fewer people are sick . But also that it would be wise to , as the DNC has recommended , adopt vote-by-mail measures that will keep people from having to travel to the polls .\nUltimately , the delays seem unlikely to change the course of the race\nBefore the full scope of the coronavirus pandemic became apparent , Biden appeared poised to become his party \u2019 s presidential nominee . A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the nomination without the aid of superdelegates , and with March \u2019 s contests behind him , Biden leads the delegate race with 1,168 pledged delegates to Sanders \u2019 s 884 .\nBefore the restructuring of the primary calendar , contests in delegate-heavy states the former vice president was expected to win \u2014 like Georgia , Pennsylvania , and New York \u2014meant he had the potential to come close to that 1,991 threshold by the end of April , or at the very least , amass so many delegates as to make it mathematically impossible for Sanders to catch up to him .\nWhile this might seem to suggest the delays are beneficial to Sanders \u2019 s campaign , this does not currently seem to be the case . The next states scheduled to vote \u2014 Kansas , Nebraska , and West Virginia \u2014 all favor Biden .\nNone of these states has a massive number of delegates and much could change between now and June , facts giving Sanders little pressure to drop out . This makes it more likely both candidates will continue to campaign until the summer , in turn making it more difficult for the party to devote resources toward fundraising for its eventual nominee and toward making preparations for the general election against President Donald Trump .\nStripping states that vote post-June 9 of their delegates would further complicate Biden \u2019 s path to victory , as doing so would take at least 191 pledged delegates out of the equation . And punishing Sanders and Biden for campaigning in late voting states would have an even greater effect ; all together , New York , Kentucky , and Louisiana have 382 delegates on offer , more than Texas and almost as many as California .\nThe DNC may be inclined to make an exception to current rules to let the primary process play out in a manner that would allow one man to claim a clean victory . Whether they do remains to be seen , but either way , come June 3 , the nation should finally have a clearer view of who will be the Democratic nominee .",
