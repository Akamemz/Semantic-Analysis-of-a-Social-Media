But the final toll is destined to be far higher than just those who die of Covid-19 . Experts warn that deaths from secondary impacts \u2014 poverty , hunger , diseases , and violence exacerbated by the pandemic \u2014 may dwarf the number of those who die of the novel coronavirus itself .\nA new analysis by researchers from King \u2019 s College London and Australian National University , under the aegis of the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research , for example , warns that the economic contraction caused by Covid-19 could push an additional 500 million people \u2014 about 8 percent of the Earth \u2019 s population \u2014 into poverty , reversing 30 years of economic improvement . \u201c We were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow Covid-19 in developing countries , \u201d said Andy Sumner , one of the study \u2019 s authors . Not surprisingly , such financial fallout has grim knock-on effects . \u201c I want to stress that we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe , \u201d warned David Beasley , the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program . \u201c Millions of civilians living in conflict-scarred nations , including many women and children , face being pushed to the brink of starvation , with the specter of famine a very real and dangerous possibility. \u201d A new study by the WFP found that lockdowns and the economic recession caused by Covid-19 may exacerbate an already dire worldwide hunger crisis , almost doubling the number of people who could go hungry , pushing a total of 265 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of the year . Meanwhile , the World Health Organization notes that a diversion of resources could have especially devastating effects on the fight against malaria . Under a worst-case scenario , in which all insecticide-treated bed net campaigns are suspended , and there is a 75 % reduction in access to effective antimalarial medicines , fatalities from the mosquito-borne illness could reach 769,000 \u2014 double the number of deaths in 2018 \u2014 effectively wiping out 20 years of gains in suppressing malaria mortality . Similarly , a new analysis by researchers at Imperial College London found that in low- and middle-income countries , disruptions to health services could cause deaths from HIV , tuberculosis , and malaria to increase by up to 10 , 20 , and 36 percent respectively over five years .\n\u201c As Covid-19 cases surge worldwide , the survival of pregnant women and children is at great risk due to strained healthcare systems , and the disruption of life-saving health services , \u201d said Dr. Stefan Peterson , associate director and global chief of health at the United Nations International Children \u2019 s Emergency Fund . In fact , researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health warn , for example , that the impact of the pandemic to newborn , child , and adolescent health and nutrition services might lead to the deaths of 1.2 million children \u2014 a 45 percent increase over existing child mortality levels . The overall death toll among the young may actually be exponentially higher according to a recent report from the Christian aid organization , World Vision . An analysis of 24 countries with existing humanitarian crises \u2014 from Afghanistan to Yemen \u2014 found that as many as 30 million children \u2019 s lives are at risk from other diseases , like diphtheria , whooping cough , and tetanus , if health care systems are swamped by the pandemic and resources are diverted from immunizations . \u201c We are wrong if we think this is not a children \u2019 s disease , \u201d said Andrew Morley , World Vision \u2019 s president and chief executive . \u201c Experience tells us that when epidemics overwhelm health systems , the impact on children is deadly. \u201d Among youths , girls will suffer most according to a recent analysis by Plan International , an aid organization that advocates for children \u2019 s rights and equality for girls . Since women and girls undertake more than three-quarters of unpaid care and , in rural communities and low-income countries , spend up to 14 hours a day on such work , girls will likely be at greater risk of infection .
