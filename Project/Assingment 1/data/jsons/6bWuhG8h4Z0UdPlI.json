    "content": "As Iran talks intensify , Boehner and Netanyahu warn against deal\nAs international envoys pressed forward on nuclear talks with Iran on Sunday , new questions arose over an issue observers had thought was already resolved : whether Iran would ship much of its uranium stockpile out of the country . Meanwhile , House Speaker John Boehner declared that Tehran can not be trusted to adhere to a deal , while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also escalated his warnings against the still-unfinished accord .\nWith an unofficial deadline of Tuesday looming to come to an agreement , Secretary of State John Kerry decided to cancel plans to appear Monday at a tribute in Boston for his mentor , the late Sen. Ted Kennedy . He was joined in the Swiss city of Lausanne by emissaries from Tehran and from five other countries \u2014 Germany , China , Russia , France and Britain \u2014 involved in the negotiations .\nBy late Sunday , however , it appeared several sticking points remained , including one that surprised many people following the talks . Iranian negotiator Abbas Araghchi said reports that Iran had agreed to ship its stockpile of uranium outside its borders were wrong . Earlier indications were the Iranians had agreed to send the material to Russia , presumably putting the fuel out of reach and unavailable for military purposes .\n\u201c None of the news that is being published is completely accurate , in particular about the transfer of uranium from the country , \u201d Araghchi said , according to the semi-official Iranian Students \u2019 News Agency . \u201c This is not in our program and we do not intend to do this . \u201d\nHe insisted , however , that there were other ways to ease worries that the uranium would be misused . The New York Times reported that Western officials had suggested that the material could be diluted , for example , so that it \u2019 s not easily enriched for use in an atomic weapons program .\nOther points of contention in the talks include how to handle the sanctions leveled against Iran , what type of research and development on centrifuges the Iranians will be allowed to pursue in the coming years and in what format a preliminary deal would be presented to the public .\nIn another sign that a deal is not imminent , The Associated Press reported that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would leave the talks Monday afternoon but would return if an agreement is reached .\nThe U.S. domestic debate over the deal played out over the airwaves Sunday , with Boehner repeating his skepticism . The Islamic Republic \u2019 s leaders \u201c have no intention of keeping their word , \u201d the Republican said on CNN , adding that the negotiations themselves are proof that current sanctions are working .\nOn ABC , meanwhile , White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that if Boehner thinks \u201c that the United States should bomb Iran to keep them from having a nuclear weapon \u2014 if he feels that way , he should have the courage of his convictions to say so. \u201d Earnest also reiterated that the White House is not looking to extend negotiations beyond Tuesday .\nAt the same time , Netanyahu , who views Iran as a mortal threat to his country , reportedly told his Cabinet on Sunday : \u201c This deal , as it appears to be emerging , bears out all of our fears , and even more than that . \u201d\nPointing to Iran \u2019 s backing of Houthi rebels advancing in Yemen , the latest front in the spreading violence in the Middle East , the Israeli leader warned : \u201c The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity , and must be stopped. \u201d He also expressed his concerns directly to U.S. Senate leaders over the weekend .\nOver the weekend , both sides insisted that it was time for the other to bend .\n\u201c Ultimately , it \u2019 s time for the Iranians to send a clear signal to the international community about whether or not they are willing to make the serious commitments that are required , \u201d Earnest said Sunday .\n\u201c In negotiations , both sides must show flexibility , \u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote Saturday on Twitter . \u201c We have , and are ready to make a good deal for all . We await our counterparts \u2019 readiness . \u201d\nThe Iranians want quick sanctions relief as part of the deal . ISNA reported Saturday that Ali Akbar Salehi , the head of Iran \u2019 s Atomic Energy Organization , said : \u201c These negotiations have technical , legal and political dimensions , and they are all connected to each other . If we solve the technical issues but not the issue of sanctions , then there \u2019 s no use in it . \u201d\nBut the U.S. and its partners have been hesitant to lift sanctions \u2014 of which there are various kinds involving multiple countries \u2014 without clear signs of change in Iran \u2019 s behavior . According to Earnest , President Barack Obama believes it would \u201c be unwise to , on the first day of an agreement with the Iranians , to take away all of the sanctions that have been in place for such a long time . \u201d\nSome reports on Saturday suggested that the parties could issue a mere news release this coming week and leave off the completion of a preliminary deal for another few weeks . Whatever initial framework is reached would then be followed by technical amendments in the next few months .
