Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , suggested that she , too , suspected the leaks came from someone in the White House . On Tuesday , however , the California Democrat tried to take back her remarks , saying she doesn \u2019 t know and should not have speculated .\nMr. Romney \u2019 s attacks , in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , marks a rare turn away from domestic issues and to foreign policy . The Republican candidate also blames the president for looming defense spending cuts and says Mr. Obama has bungled the situation in Syria .\nThe attack on the White House about leaks underscored a potential lingering problem for Mr. Obama , who in the past month has found himself on the defensive over several news stories \u2014 including one about a covert U.S. cyberattack on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and another on the so-called terrorist \u201c kill list \u201d \u2014 that appear to hinge on top-secret information .\nLed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona , Mr. Obama \u2019 s opponent in the 2008 election , Republicans have argued that the administration leaked the material to make the president look good and that a special counsel should dig into the matter , rather than the two U.S. attorneys who Attorney General Eric H.
