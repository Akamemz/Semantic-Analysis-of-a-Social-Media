They \u2019 ve been angered by criticisms coming from some conservatives in the House of Representatives and the media as well , as some mutterings from White House figures about signs of bias in Mueller \u2019 s probe tasked with getting to the bottom of allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia . Warner \u2019 s talk about Mueller \u2019 s possible firing being a \u201c red line \u201d made it clear that Democrats intended to make the president pay a high price for removing a potent legal threat to his continued tenure in office .\nBut the problem with Warner \u2019 s impassioned address and all the head nodding it inspired among his fellow Democrats is that there is no sign that Trump intends to fire Mueller . That \u2019 s a point the White House has repeatedly made and one that even Trump explicitly made this week when he said flatly , \u201c No , I \u2019 m not firing Mueller. \u201d But not even that was enough to prevent Warner from his diatribe about what it would mean if Trump did what he had just said he wouldn \u2019 t do . Nor was Warner alone , as liberal pundits have been flying to the special counsel \u2019 s defense with such headlines as the Washington Post \u2019 s \u201c The growing specter of Robert Mueller \u2019 s firing \u201d on Thursday .\nThe pro-Mueller offensive is rooted in the assumption that conservatives are engaged in a \u201c fake news \u201d campaign aimed at destroying Mueller \u2019 s credibility so as to ease Trump \u2019 s way toward firing him or to undermine faith in the conclusions of his investigation if it is allowed to continue .\nLet \u2019 s concede that Trump might change his mind , and that his anger about the special counsel \u2019 s work and the entire effort to portray his presidential campaign as the work of Russian intelligence is not exactly a secret . But after several months of grousing about Mueller , the signals from the White House have made it clear the administration knows that it is in Trump \u2019 s best interest to cooperate with him and to just wait for the investigation to finish rather than provide the Left with another pretext for talk about impeachment .\nSo what \u2019 s really driving the drumbeat of liberal rhetoric about Mueller being fired ?\nThe answer has to do not so much with the distrust the Left has about Trump \u2019 s intentions as with the yawning divide between liberals and conservatives in a battle over the legitimacy of the Trump presidency \u2014 a battle in which there is little middle ground left . It \u2019 s not just that liberals don \u2019 t believe conservatives have a case when they raise objections to the political affiliations of those working with Mueller ; it \u2019 s also that the specific narrative they are trying to establish about Trump rests on assumptions that require them to believe he is the second coming of Richard Nixon .\nPerhaps Warner actually believes that Trump is planning his own version of a \u201c Saturday Night Massacre \u201d \u2014 Nixon \u2019 s 1973 firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox , and of an attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to carry out his order .

It \u2019 s part of a set of assumptions about the charges of Russian collusion in which Trump is considered guilty until proven innocent .

If Democrats win back the House in 2018 , that will mean Nadler will preside over impeachment proceedings against Trump . While he said that such talk was premature and that any bill of impeachment must have bipartisan support , the fact that his party is already intent on pushing for Trump \u2019 s removal from office as soon as they have the power to act on that desire is abundantly clear .
