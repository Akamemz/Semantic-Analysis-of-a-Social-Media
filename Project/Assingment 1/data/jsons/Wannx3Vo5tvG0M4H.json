    "content": "Yes , the social-media giants treat conservatives unfairly , but that does n't mean the government should get involved .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions is convening a meeting of state attorneys general to consider whether Facebook , Google , Twitter , and other social-media companies are \u201c intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas. \u201d The honorable gentleman from Alabama should stick to his brief .\nTwo quick questions asked and answered . One : Do these companies treat conservatives unfairly ? Yes , they do . Two : Is that any business of the attorney general of the United States of America ? No , it isn \u2019 t .\nA funny thing happened on the way to the counterrevolution . Conservative media have become a constituency of the Republican party . Conservative media have had many different relationships to the Republican party over the years : sometimes a megaphone , sometimes a critic , sometimes a talent scout , sometimes a friendly forum for working out in-the-family disagreements . But its emergence as a political constituency with interests and demands of its own is something new . It is no longer merely a voice for conservative interests but an interest group of its own , and for the moment its attention is focused on Silicon Valley .\nOur friend Dennis Prager has played a role in this . He unsuccessfully sued Google ( the firm is officially known as Alphabet , and it owns YouTube ) , claiming that the company has violated the First Amendment by engaging in viewpoint discrimination as it restricts certain videos , including his PragerU presentations , which cover a wide variety of topics : At this writing , the top three videos on his site are \u201c What Is Net Neutrality ? \u201d , \u201c Left Or Liberal ? \u201d , and \u201c Make Men Masculine Again. \u201d Some of the videos touching on religion and sexuality have been restricted , even while comparable videos from nonconservative sources are left unmolested .\nThe restrictions are ridiculous . Prager is one of the Americans least likely to produce videos that are obscene , that incite violence , or that in any other way pose a risk to \u201c safety , \u201d which is the theoretical justification that most Internet companies use to restrict content . Agree or disagree with him , it is hard to argue that Dennis Prager is somehow outside the mainstream of American life . But that does not seem to matter : Videos from Hillsdale College have been restricted as well ; if there is an institution less likely than Hillsdale to coarsen public discourse , I can not think what it is .\nBut this is not about political content , and it isn \u2019 t even really about political bias : Facebook , Google , et al . operate in an almost uniformly Left-Democratic culture , and they heard a great deal from both organized and semi-organized efforts from progressives and left-wing organizations whose sole purpose in life is trying to discredit conservative figures and exclude conservatives from public discourse . But they are not responding to concerns about \u201c safety , \u201d and they are not ordinarily responding to concerns about possible legal issues . They are responding to peer pressure . What the Left has discovered is that the bosses at Facebook and Google and Twitter can be embarrassed , and that figures such as Alex Jones embarrass them in a way that figures such as Louis Farrakhan do not . This is a crutch , a strategy that is going to play itself out eventually : Pointing the finger Invasion of the Body-Snatchers\u2013style and screaming \u201c Racist ! \u201d at Ben Shapiro is ridiculous , and eventually it will be seen as such .\nPeer pressure is not a problem that is likely to be effectively solved through the careful ministrations of the U.S. Department of Justice , or by the attentions of state prosecutors . And Republicans here are coming dangerously close to the Democrats \u2019 game : abusing prosecutorial powers to bully their political opponents on issues such as climate change , under the transparent and risible pretense that they are investigating securities fraud or consumer-safety laws .\nEarlier this year , I sat on a panel with Pete Wilson and a few other conservative activists . Wilson was part of Prager \u2019 s legal team . With me as the sole exception , the panel was unanimously in favor of regulating social-media companies in such a way as to keep them from disadvantaging conservative-leaning content . On what constitutional grounds ? Somebody will think of one , I am sure . It was quite something to hear Republicans sounding like Elizabeth Warren on a trust-busting bender , but it is difficult to take seriously the proposition that what \u2019 s at work here is concern about monopoly power , Supreme Court precedents , or anything of the sort : This is about friends and enemies , and Republicans have decided that Silicon Valley is the enemy .\nSilicon Valley has more than returned the favor . To some extent , this is a question of politics on the ground : Internet companies tend to be located in places that do not love Republicans \u2014 and places that Republicans do not love . Republicans apparently have decided that instead of trying to win votes in California or New York City , the best thing to do is to use those parts of the country as pi\u00f1atas to be beaten for the amusement of Republican stalwarts in Kansas and Wyoming . It is not obvious that this is the right path for Republicans : As our friend J. D. Vance points out , three states \u2014 California , New York , and Massachusetts \u2014 account for the vast majority ( about 75 percent ) of venture-capital investment in the United States . And for \u201c three states \u201d you can read \u201c three metropolitan areas , \u201d those being the Bay Area , New York City , and greater Boston . A Republican party without a business constituency is an unviable thing , and promises of tax cuts followed by more tax cuts probably will not do the trick .\nRepublicans might try the carrot before the stick . ( Especially since the stick is unlikely to survive judicial challenge . ) Silicon Valley is indeed full of insufferably puritanical progressives , but get them talking about protectionism in the Asian markets or European tax challenges , and they sound like Milton Friedman . ( Kids : Milton Friedman is a very famous economist whose opinions Republicans used to value back when they believed in things like capitalism and free trade . ) There have been some recent efforts to help with some of this , for instance improving the outdated portions of NAFTA covering online commerce and international trade in digital services . Republicans are going to need to make inroads there eventually , and they should want to have a fruitful relationship with America \u2019 s most successful industry . Treating social-media companies like a 1930s telephone company is not going to get that done .\nThe judge in the case wisely threw out Prager \u2019 s lawsuit on the grounds that the First Amendment is a restriction on the state , and Google is a private business , not a state or an arm of government . There is some Supreme Court precedent on Prager \u2019 s side , including the 1945 case of Marsh v. Alabama , which held that Jehovah \u2019 s Witnesses proselytizers had a First Amendment right to distribute their propaganda in a town that was entirely owned by a private corporation .

Tanner , which held that the owner of a shopping mall could pick and choose what to allow on its own premises . The difference , as Justice Lewis Powell saw it , was that in the case of the company town , there was no public space for the missionaries to use , whereas the privately owned mall was surrounded by the very public streets of downtown Portland , Ore .
