    "content": "Responding to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's claims GOP leadership was the cause of the delay of the latest coronavirus stimulus relief , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , ripped Pelosi for trying to hold it up for broke-state bailouts .\n`` We 're not interested in revenue replacement for state governments , '' McConnell told Fox News ' `` Bill Hemmer Reports . '' `` We 're interested in trying to helping them in anything related to the coronavirus .\n`` We 're not interested in solving their pension problems and all these other things that they would like for us to finance . ''\nStates like New York under Gov . Andrew Cuomo have said they are broke and need federal funding in the form of bonds and direct grants .\n`` What they really wanted to do was to pass legislation to send money to local governments , and what I said was we are not going to do that , '' McConnell said . `` We will wait and take a pause , and we will assess the future potential damage to the country by adding $ 2.7 trillion to the national debt .\n`` And the next time we consider , shall I say , a Phase 4 , it 'll be after all the members of the Senate are back , which would be , at the earliest , May 4 . ''\nEarlier Wednesday , McConnell told `` The Hugh Hewitt Show , '' if states are broke , they should just declare bankruptcy protection and not try to piggyback a bailout for their mismanagement on coronavirus relief .\n`` Yeah , I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route , '' McConnell said . `` It saves some cities , and there 's no good reason for it not to be available . ''\nPelosi , who has been ripped by President Donald Trump for being on vacation during the House recess , delaying the replenishment of the small business Payroll Protection Program , had deflected criticism back to Trump and McConnell , suggesting they did not want to help out hospitals .\n`` It was in fact delayed by democratic maneuvers , '' McConnell said . `` And we put $ 310 billion in to replenish the program for small businesses , which ran out of money 12 days ago , and we also added $ 75 billion for hospitals , and we know they are struggling .\n`` Probably even more important than that : $ 25 billion for testing . ''\nTesting is the key to get the economy going again , as the Reopening America Again plan guidelines call for comprehensive testing to control the spread of the virus , particularly if pockets flare up as hot spots .\n`` We have really developed kind of a Manhattan project approach to testing , '' McConnell said . `` Because we know that , even when the governors begin to open up the economy \u2013 as , in my view , they should begin to do \u2013 and when hospitals are allowed once again to do elective surgery , which is the only place they make any money , we can begin to get out of this malaise by bringing the economy back to life . ''\nMcConnell concluded the economy can get to work and hospitals can make revenue again by states opening back up , as opposed to staying shut down and relying on the federal government to keep them afloat .",
