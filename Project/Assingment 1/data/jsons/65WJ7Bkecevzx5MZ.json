It \u2019 s a move he \u2019 s been teasing for weeks .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to be signing today and registering national emergency , and it \u2019 s a great thing to do , \u201d Trump said in a speech at the White House Rose Garden on Friday announcing the decision . He claimed the measure was needed to stop an \u201c invasion \u201d of people , gangs , and drugs . ( There is no such invasion . )\nTrump is simultaneously signing a bill to fund the government through September and taking executive action , including declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border .\nIn December , he refused to sign a funding bill , spurring a 35-day partial government shutdown . The funding bill he will now sign actually has less money for physical barriers than a bipartisan bill the Senate had proposed last year . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Li Zhou explains , this legislation has $ 1.375 billion for \u201c existing technologies , \u201d such as the current fencing at the southern border . The Senate \u2019 s prior legislation had $ 1.6 billion . Trump wanted $ 5.7 billion for the construction of some 200 miles of wall .\nHe is now declaring a national emergency in addition to the spending deal because he doesn \u2019 t want it to look like he lost . But can he do it ? Many Democrats and some legal scholars have said that Trump can \u2019 t declare a national emergency to get the border wall funded . Others say there are avenues he could definitely try , setting up potential battles in Congress and in the courts .\n\u201c He has broad leeway to declare an emergency , frankly , whether one exists or not , \u201d Elizabeth Goitein , a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice , who recently wrote an in-depth explainer of presidential emergency powers in the Atlantic , told me in January .\nTrump invoking emergency powers is indicative of how far he \u2019 ll go to appease his base \u2014 Trump is so hell-bent on his wall , it seems he \u2019 ll try almost anything . Or at least to continue with this political stunt .\n\u201c This is really kind of Hollywood-like , what he \u2019 s trying to do , \u201d Princeton University political historian Julian Zelizer said .\nHow Trump thinks he could get the wall by declaring a national emergency\nMany presidents have declared national emergencies , including George W. Bush after 9/11 and Barack Obama during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 .\nIn recent history , they \u2019 ve done so under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , which lets presidents issue an emergency declaration but under certain constraints \u2014 namely , Trump can only use specific powers Congress has already codified by law , and he has to say which powers he \u2019 s using . The 1976 law was actually passed to rein in presidential power and codify how presidents were going about declaring emergencies , from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Richard Nixon . It offers no definition for what counts as an emergency .\nIn trying to get wall funding through the National Emergencies Act , the question then becomes which existing laws he can try to use to get the money . That \u2019 s where he \u2014 and the legal scholars trying to figure out what he \u2019 s talking about \u2014 run into trouble : identifying the laws and statutes he could actually use . The Brennan Center for Justice tracks about 130 laws that contain special powers Trump could access .\n\u201c It could be that by putting together a lot of different sources of emergency authority , the president could tap a lot of different funds and at least start , \u201d Kim Lane Scheppele , a professor at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University , told me .\nShe pointed to a handful of preexisting laws the president could potentially use .\nHe could , for example , reallocate military spending on construction projects for the wall . One law allows the defense secretary , after a national emergency declaration , to direct the army \u2019 s civil works program to construct a structure needed for national defense and use the military budget to do it . Another lets the secretary direct other military services for construction projects . For example , money could come out of the budget for building housing on military bases for service members and into the budget for the wall .\nOr Trump could declare a \u201c state of immigration emergency , \u201d which unlocks an immigration emergency fund . It \u2019 s generally supposed to be used to help states feed and house migrants and process their claims , but Scheppele said that it is \u201c vaguely worded enough to permit an edgy interpretation \u201d that could get the funds for the wall . The issue there is that the fund only has about $ 20 million at the moment , not enough for Trump \u2019 s wall .\nThe White House on Friday identified a couple of specific options for Trump to try to cobble together funds . Ahead of the announcement on Friday , officials said he would redirect about $ 600 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund , an account funded by money seized by the US government ; $ 2.5 billion from the Department of Defense \u2019 s counter-drug activities ; and $ 3.6 billion from other military construction accounts . Trump won \u2019 t try to take anything from disaster relief .\nSince Trump started talking about declaring an emergency to fund the border wall , there has been some debate about whether he has the legal authority to do so .\nBruce Ackerman , a law professor at Yale University , wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times that Trump can not declare an emergency at the border , arguing that Trump \u2019 s actions would be illegal , and they would force the armed forces tasked with carrying out his orders to choose between abiding by the commander-in-chief \u2019 s wishes and committing a federal crime .\n\u201c The president of the United States has a constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , \u201d Ackerman said in a subsequent phone interview . \u201c It is unconstitutional for him to take care to violate the laws of the United States . \u201d\nOthers have echoed Ackerman \u2019 s declaration that Trump can \u2019 t lawfully declare a state of emergency for the wall .\nRep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) in an appearance on CNN \u2019 s State of the Union said the idea was a \u201c nonstarter. \u201d Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said in a Fox Business appearance that the president \u201c can not spend money unless it \u2019 s been authorized by Congress . \u201d\nSome have pointed to a Korean War-era court case , Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , in which the Supreme Court ruled that President Harry Truman \u2019 s attempt to nationalize US steel mills during a strike in the Korean War was unconstitutional . \u201c If Harry Truman couldn \u2019 t nationalize the steel industry during wartime , this president doesn \u2019 t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border , \u201d Schiff told CNN .\nScheppele , however , expressed skepticism that the case actually applies in what Trump is proposing to do . \u201c Once you get into the specific area of emergency powers , then the president is acting within a delegated framework , \u201d she said .\nOthers say Trump can do it \u2014 and it might be harder to stop him than you \u2019 d think\nIf Trump does declare a national emergency for the border wall , there will almost certainly be challenges to him in both Congress and the courts . But it \u2019 s not entirely obvious they will stick . As we saw with Trump \u2019 s travel ban , he \u2019 s often willing to do things that go over the legal line , and then leave the courts to figure out where exactly that line lies .\nThe National Emergencies Act contains a mechanism for Congress to overrule the president by passing a joint resolution out of the House and Senate . With Democrats in control of the House , it would presumably pass there easily , and Ackerman , the Yale professor , says he believes it could pass the Senate too .\n\u201c Mitch McConnell does not have the power to bottle this up , \u201d he said . \u201c So that means that there would be a moment of truth for the Republican Party . \u201d\nBut due to a 35-year-old court case , Congress might not be able to override the president that easily . In the 1983 case Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha , the Supreme Court decided that a one-house legislative veto violated the Constitution . After that , the National Emergencies Act was amended to require the joint resolution to override the president \u2019 s declaration \u2014 like a typical law , it requires a simple majority in the House and Senate and the president \u2019 s signature .\nTrump would probably not be willing to sign a joint resolution to reject his own emergency declaration , so that means that Congress would need to override him with a two-thirds majority in each chamber .\n\u201c The safeguard you think is there in the National Emergencies Act turns out not to be there , or at least most constitutional scholars who have looked at that question closely think that the Supreme Court would never go for it , especially now that we have a Supreme Court with two new members who are unusually deferential to executive power , \u201d Scheppele said . \u201c It could be that actually nobody could tell him no . \u201d\nMcConnell , speaking on the Senate floor on Thursday , said he supports the president \u2019 s emergency declaration . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) at a press conference on Thursday said congressional Democrats would review their options and are \u201c prepared to respond appropriately \u201d to Trump \u2019 s declaration .\nA national emergency declaration for the border wall would likely face a challenge in the courts . But it \u2019 s not clear which parties would have standing to file a lawsuit , and moreover , any decisions would take time .\nBeing the first mover in declaring the emergency would give Trump a \u201c tremendous advantage , \u201d Ackerman said .\n\u201c There are good legal challenges , to be sure , and I think there would be a real fight , \u201d Goitein , from the Brennan Center , said .\nTrump on Friday anticipated the court battle . \u201c Look , I expect to be sued , \u201d he said .\nSome Republicans previously encouraged Trump to declare the emergency . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) in a tweet earlier in January called on the president to declare an emergency to build the wall . Rep. Mo Brooks ( R-SC ) said in an interview on CNN that Trump had the right to declare an emergency \u201c because the United States code says so . \u201d\nMr. President , the Democrats are not working in good faith with you .\nDeclare emergency , build the wall now . \u2014 Lindsey Graham ( @ LindseyGrahamSC ) January 11 , 2019\nBeyond the legal questions around what Trump can do and how he can do it , there are some more fundamental issues : The US government was shut down over a campaign trail call that Trump uses to rile up his base , and there \u2019 s no new emergency at the US-Mexico border .\n\u201c There is no national security crisis , \u201d Zelizer , from Princeton , said . \u201c We are not at war , and it \u2019 s not clear anything is happening at the border . \u201d\nThis isn \u2019 t the first time Trump has invented an immigration crisis when convenient \u2014 ahead of the midterms , he started warning about dire threats from a migrant caravan , only to more or less drop the issue once November 6 came and went . Now that Congress won \u2019 t agree to his border wall , and obviously Mexico isn \u2019 t paying for it , he \u2019 s manufacturing panic yet again .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an emergency whenever it suits his purposes , but that ought not to be the test , \u201d said Michael Gerhardt , a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina \u2019 s School of Law .\nThis also puts to the test the Republican Party and its willingness \u2014 or , frankly , lack thereof \u2014 to stand up to Trump . The GOP spent years complaining about Obama \u2019 s overreach , so now that Trump is making up an emergency to pay for a border wall Congress does not want , what will they do ?\n\u201c If this were a Democratic president , Republicans would say Obama is going to have to put up or shut up . But because it \u2019 s Trump , Republicans will argue that we should defer to the president , \u201d Gerhardt said . \u201c We have to consider at what point this deferral means the president is usurping legislative authority . \u201d\nRepublicans have expressed concern that Trump \u2019 s emergency declaration now might lead to declarations from future Democratic presidents in the future on issues such as climate change or health care . Pelosi on Thursday made sure to point that out . \u201c I know the Republicans have some unease about it , no matter what they say , because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency , an illusion that he wants to convey , just think of what a president with values can present to the American people , \u201d she said .\nRegardless of the concerns , Trump appears determined to give it a go .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly not a slam-dunk that he can , \u201d Goitein said , \u201c but it \u2019 s not a slam-dunk that he can \u2019 t , either . \u201d\nAfter the government shutdown ended , she questioned in a Twitter thread Trump \u2019 s tactic of threatening to declare an emergency if Congress doesn \u2019 t give him what he wants . If he \u2019 s able to wait three weeks , and Congress in that time decides against funding against the wall , \u201c declaring an emergency to build one anyway is a massive abuse of power and quite likely a violation of the Constitution . \u201d\nBy going in this direction , she wrote , \u201c he makes it about 10 times more likely that lawsuits challenging the declaration will succeed . \u201d",
