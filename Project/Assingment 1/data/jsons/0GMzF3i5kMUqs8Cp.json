    "content": "A series of posts on Facebook and Twitter responding to Quaker Oats \u2019 decision to discontinue the Aunt Jemima logo and brand went viral as they claimed to tell the history of Aunt Jemima .\nThe posts make similar claims : that discontinuing the brand is an affront to the legacy of the \u201c original \u201d Aunt Jemima , a former slave named Nancy Green who was the first model hired to portray the character . With a few variations , the posts say that Green created a cooking brand that was purchased by a larger company , which turned the brand into Aunt Jemima and used her likeness to promote the product . As a result , the posts claim , she became a millionaire . The viral tweet further suggests that Green created what became the Aunt Jemima brand , which was bought out by Genera Mills , and the Facebook post claims that Green \u2019 s supposed wealth allowed her to become an anti-poverty and equal rights activist .\nThe actual history of Nancy Green is a little difficult to uncover ; record keeping of that period , especially for African-Americans , was spotty . What is known of the life of Green and other African Americans in similar roles at the time , however , indicates that her relationship with the Aunt Jemima brand was not the equal , beneficial partnership that these viral posts make it out to be .\nThere \u2019 s no evidence that Green created a cooking brand or that she inspired the Aunt Jemima image . The Aunt Jemima brand was started by Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood , who named their new pancake flour after a minstrel show song titled \u201c Old Aunt Jemima. \u201d Green was hired after Rutt and Underwood sold the company to R.T. Davis , to portray an image that already existed in popular culture : that of a \u201c mammy , \u201d a racist stereotype of an amiable , older , overweight , African American woman who served in a domestic role to whites . The logo has changed six times in order to move away from the mammy stereotype , meaning the logo currently on Aunt Jemima products does not , as some have suggested , still depict Nancy Green .\nPatricia Turner is a professor in UCLA \u2019 s Department of African American Studies and senior dean of the UCLA College .
