The Trump administration on Tuesday sued to delay its release , a week before it was set to be published . So , naturally , major news outlets have now \u201c obtained \u201d the book and are releasing the most explosive passages from the memoir .\nBolton \u2019 s book , The Room Where It Happened , contains numerous remarkable allegations about things President Trump said and did during his interactions with foreign leaders \u2014 none of which , it \u2019 s worth remembering , Bolton felt compelled to speak publicly about in the months since he left the administration or to testify about unless he was formally subpoenaed during the Senate \u2019 s impeachment trial .\nBut now that he has a book to sell , the longtime Republican foreign policy hand seems ready to dish .\nIn the book , Bolton \u2014 who , again , declined to voluntarily testify under oath during the impeachment trial because the White House told him not to \u2014 accuses the Democrat-led House of Representatives of committing \u201c impeachment malpractice \u201d by not going beyond Trump \u2019 s dealings with Ukraine to investigate other disturbing actions of Trump \u2019 s . Like , for example , Bolton \u2019 s claim that Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping for electoral help and other instances where Trump sought to use his power for personal or political gain . ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 hasn \u2019 t seen the book in its entirety , so we are relying on reports and excerpts published elsewhere . )\nAs national security adviser , Bolton was definitely in the room where stuff happened , and as such was privy to Trump \u2019 s conversations with world leaders , maybe more than most . Which lends some degree of credibility to his claims .\nAt the same time , this is Bolton \u2019 s account , and it \u2019 s not like he and Trump parted on great terms . Bolton , a conservative hawk , didn \u2019 t always seem like the right fit for Trump \u2019 s more isolationist foreign policy approach , and the two clashed over issues like North Korea and not being able to start wars . So some of Bolton \u2019 s claims may be self-serving or tough to verify .\nOf course , verifying his claims might have been easier had Bolton testified before Congress under threat of perjury .\nAcknowledging that there are no heroes here , below are some of the wildest and most disturbing tidbits from Bolton \u2019 s memoir . Read them , and imagine an alternate universe where Bolton \u2019 s mustache is moving up and down as he delivers an opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee in the fall of 2019 . It kind of helps .\nAccording to Bolton , President Trump brought up his reelection prospects with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a one-on-one meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan . Xi mentioned China \u2019 s critics in the US , and according to Bolton , Trump thought the Chinese leader meant Democrats .

A Pentagon official has described them as \u201c concentration camps . \u201d\nBeijing has imposed repressive policies on the group and has Uighurs closely surveilled . It is a clear violation of human rights and ethnic cleansing , one Trump has at least condemned publicly .\nBolton \u2019 s book said Trump opposed putting sanctions on China for the issue because of trade negotiations , according to the Wall Street Journal . On Wednesday , the same day as Bolton \u2019 s book was released , Trump signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 , according to the White House .\nAccording to Bolton , Trump was apparently surprised that the United Kingdom \u2014 one of America \u2019 s closest allies \u2014 had nuclear weapons during a meeting with former British Prime Minister Theresa May in 2018 . \u201c Oh , are you a nuclear power ? \u201d Trump said , according to Bolton .\nThe UK was the third country to acquire the nuclear bomb , following the US and the Soviet Union . It conducted its first successful test of an atomic bomb in 1952 .\nBolton writes that Trump once asked his then-Chief of Staff Gen.

Bolton tried to stop Trump from delivering the threat , and became even more alarmed when Trump told him , \u201c Do you want to do something historic ? \u201d\nBolton claims in the book that Trump told China \u2019 s Xi that Americans wanted him to get rid of the two-term limit imposed on presidents by the US Constitution .\nBolton also claims that Trump , apparently mad about leaks to the media coming from inside his administration , complained in 2019 that journalists should be jailed .
