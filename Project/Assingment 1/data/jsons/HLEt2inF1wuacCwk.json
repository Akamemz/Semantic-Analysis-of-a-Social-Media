This gave government the power to search any residence or business without any warning, supervision or rules. Soldiers were allowed to walk from door-to-door, house-to-house, searching and confiscating property to their hearts\u2019 content.\n\nAs is always the case with government power, this policy was widely abused. When the Founding Fathers drafted and ratified the U.S. Constitution, they included the Fourth Amendment \u2014 the prohibition of search and seizure \u2014 to guarantee that no such affronts to liberty would happen again.\n\nThat is, if we follow the Constitution.\n\nToday, we see a government agency that thinks its has the power to search citizens by going from phone-to-phone, gathering any-and-all data to examine to their hearts\u2019 content. The National Security Agency phone scandal is precisely the sort of government action the Founding Fathers fought a revolution to stop and why we celebrate the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nWe also have an Internal Revenue Service that targets political dissidents, which is a direct violation of the First Amendment. A Department of Justice that seizes journalists\u2019 phone records without a warrant, which is a violation of both the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\nThe signers of the Declaration of Independence would be appalled.\n\nAnother reason we fought the revolution was to prevent government oppression of protest, with perhaps the Boston Massacre being the most famous example.\n\nIn Egypt, protest is met with tear gas, manufactured in America and paid for with American taxes. When Egyptians protest, they protest against their government and also America for subsidizing that government.\n\nDespite the fact that Mohamed Morsi recently convicted 16 Americans of political crimes in a show trial, the Obama administration still sent them over $2 billion this year.\n\nAmerican tax dollars flow no matter which despot rules.\n\nHosni Mubarak brutally suppressed protest over three decades of martial law. Yet, we sent him some $60 billion, much of which was stolen by Mr. Mubarak and his family.\n\nMr. Mubarak abused his citizens and his own power, yet we gave him billions of dollars and advanced weaponry, including F-16 jets.

To what end?\n\nPeople must fight for their own freedom. We fought for it in our own country, even as we see today\u2019s government so often betraying the Founders\u2019 vision. We see people fighting for freedom in other countries, even as US interventions work to stifle their efforts.\n\nThis week, as we commemorate our independence from England 237 years ago, we must remind our leaders that they took an oath to the Constitution that we expect them to keep.
