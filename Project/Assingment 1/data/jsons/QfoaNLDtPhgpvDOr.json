During the attack , the couple reportedly stated that their attack was part of a `` revolution , '' according to Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill .\nThe Millers appear to have been motivated by extreme far-right views . The couple left a flag at the scene of the crime with the words `` Do n't Tread on Me , '' a Revolutionary War symbol used by some anti-government extremists .\nThey also left a swastika at the scene , though McMahill cautioned to reporters , `` We do n't necessary believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement . We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis . ''\nMcMahill added an assessment of the Millers ' ideological roots saying , `` There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that 's along the lines of militia and white supremacists . ''\nMcMahill also confirmed that Jerad Miller had written on his Facebook page that he had been ejected from the Bundy Ranch , the Nevada site where armed ranchers as well some with anti-government militia ties held off federal officials at gunpoint in April . However , McMahill was not able to confirm Miller 's actual presence at the ranch . ( Cliven Bundy 's son Ammon said that `` state militia members '' told him the Millers had been at the ranch , but were asked by a militia member to leave because of `` their radical beliefs . '' )\nThe attack in Vegas is far from the only incident of violence by the American far right . According to data collected by the New America Foundation , right-wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents , in the United States since the 9/11 attacks . That number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by al-Qaeda 's ideology in the United States in the post-9/11 era .\nAlthough a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11 , none have been linked to a lethal attack .\nAs we pointed out in this space less than two months ago , a man shot and killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and then drove to a nearby Jewish retirement community where he shot and killed a third person .

Page committed suicide during the attack .\nPage is not , of course , the only right-wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends . In 2009 , for instance , Shawna Forde , Albert Gaxiola , and Jason Bush raided a house in Arizona , killing Raul Flores and his daughter Brisenia . The three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group , Minutemen American Defense . Forde and Bush were convicted and sentenced to death .
