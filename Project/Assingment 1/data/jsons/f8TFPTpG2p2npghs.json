    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who is the top White House economic adviser told lawmakers he could support legislation breaking up the largest U.S. banks , according to people familiar with the matter , a development that bolsters congressional efforts to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law .\nThe comments by Gary Cohn , director of the White House National Economic Council , came in a private meeting with lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday , these people said . His remarks were reported earlier by Bloomberg .\nMr. Cohn was asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) whether the administration planned to carry out a promise included in the Republican 2016 platform\u2014and made by the Trump campaign\u2014to restore the law separating traditional commercial banking from Wall Street investment banking . The law was repealed in 1999 .\nMr. Cohn expressed an openness to working with Ms. Warren on the issue , and said he could support a simple policy completely separating the two businesses , these people said . There are various ideas for restoring some form of Glass-Steagall , running the gamut from splitting apart firms completely to separating their various operations under an umbrella holding company .\nA White House spokeswoman said Mr. Cohn \u201c was simply discussing the president \u2019 s previously stated position , \u201d adding , \u201c The president spoke to the need for a simplification of the banking system on the campaign trail , what he called a \u2018 21st century Glass-Steagall , \u2019 to make it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs in their communities . \u201d\nMr. Cohn \u2019 s comments are consistent with other statements by Trump administration officials . But it isn \u2019 t clear how much support there is for the idea among Republicans more broadly . Ms. Warren on Thursday reintroduced a bill called the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act . Three other senators joined her , including one Republican , Sen. John McCain of Arizona . In the last Congress , Mr. McCain was the only Republican to sponsor the bill .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also said the administration is open to implementing some version of President Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign promise . But in his Jan. 17 confirmation hearing , he expressed concern that \u201c separating out banks and investment banks right now under Glass-Steagall would have very big implications to the liquidity in the capital markets and banks being able to perform necessary lending . \u201d\nWhile the Trump team has endorsed the Glass-Steagall idea , it hasn \u2019 t come forward with its own proposal . Meanwhile , Treasury officials are meeting with financial-industry officials to discuss ways to roll back rules adopted under the Obama administration .
