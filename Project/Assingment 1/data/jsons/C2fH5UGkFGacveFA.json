Here's everything you need to know:\n\nHow do masks fight COVID-19?\n\nThe mouth and nose are usually where the coronavirus first sets up camp, and also serve as the portals for spreading the virus to new hosts. The saliva of infected people teems with virus particles, which are emitted in droplets when they cough or sneeze. Smaller drops, called aerosols, are launched when a person speaks or even just breathes. Larger droplets are thought to be the primary means of transmission and can be propelled six or more feet before gravity pulls them down to the ground.

To a lesser extent, they protect the wearer from receiving particles in their own mouth and nose.\n\nHow effective are masks?\n\nThough different studies reach varying statistical conclusions, the overwhelming consensus is that they help stem transmission. Jeremy Howard, an Australian data scientist who created the website Masks4All.co, has identified 34 papers showing their effectiveness, and none that show otherwise.
