Rick Snyder to abandon their efforts to pass the law , which would forbid unions from charging its members dues automatically . Michigan would be the 24th state to adopt the right-to-work law , following Indiana \u2019 s passage of a similar law in February .\nLabor groups and their Democratic allies plan more protests as the bills to implement right-to-work are voted on this week , calling the issue a divisive one in a state long seen as a bastion of the union movement .\n\u201c Folks from our state \u2019 s capital all the way to the nation \u2019 s capital should be focused on the same thing , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c They should be working to make sure companies like this manufacturer is able to make more great products . America \u2019 s not going to compete based on low-skill , low-wage , no workers \u2019 rights \u2014 that \u2019 s not our competitive advantage . \u201d\nHe said higher union wages enable workers to buy American products , \u201c because they \u2019 ve got enough money in their pockets . \u201d\nBut supporters of the right-to-work law , which would undercut a key source of union funding , say Mr. Obama \u2019 s opposition represents a political payback .\nMark Mix , president of the National Right to Work Committee , said it was \u201c no surprise \u201d that Mr. Obama would oppose individual choice for workers .\n\u201c After Big Labor bosses spent nearly a billion dollars in 2008 , and a billion more in 2012 , to elect President Obama and other forced unionism partisans to office , it is expected that President Obama would want to prop up a system of political paybacks that compels workers to pay for union boss politics that benefit Obama and other Big Labor politicians as a condition of employment , \u201d he said in a statement .\nMr . Mix said private-sector employment has increased 12.5 percent in right-to-work states over the past decade , far better than in states where there is no right-to-work laws .\nFresh from a face-to-face meeting with Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the \u201c fiscal cliff , \u201d Mr. Obama visited the auto plant to press his case for higher taxes on wealthier families .\nThe president said he \u2019 s \u201c willing to compromise a little bit \u201d in the negotiations to reach a deficit-reduction deal , but said he won \u2019 t compromise on his proposal to hike tax rates on families earning more than $ 250,000 per year , while preserving tax cuts for the middle class .\nHis visit to the Detroit area also represented something of a victory lap for Mr. Obama , who campaigned heavily for reelection on his support for the auto bailout and accused Republican opponent Mitt Romney of abandoning the industry . Mr. Obama carried the state Nov. 6 , despite the fact that his GOP rival was born there .\nThe president praised the German-based Daimler for announcing Monday that it will invest $ 125 million in an expansion of its U.S. operations , creating 115 new jobs .\n\u201c For a long time , companies \u2026 weren \u2019 t always making those kinds of investments here in the United States , \u201d Mr. Obama told the autoworkers . \u201c All of you , the men and women who built these companies with your own hands , would have been hung out to dry . I wasn \u2019 t about to let that happen . I placed my bet on American workers . Three-and-a-half years later , that bet is paying off . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s trip is the latest in a series of campaign-style events staged by the White House to generate public support for the tax increase . It comes after his Sunday meeting with Mr. Boehner , Ohio Republican , to negotiate a long-term budget deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January .\nThe administration and Mr. Boehner \u2019 s office declined to provide details of the session at the White House , although they said they were keeping the lines of communication open . It was their first meeting since Nov. 16 , although the two men have spoken by phone in the interim .\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One Monday that keeping the details of their conversation secret could help move along the negotiations .\n\u201c We believe that it \u2019 s in the best interest of the prospects of getting an agreement , \u201d Mr. Carney said .\nHe also said Republicans have yet to make a specific proposal on how they will raise revenues . The president is seeking about $ 1.6 trillion in new revenue over 10 years , while Mr. Boehner offered in a letter to the president on Dec. 3 to raise about $ 800 billion by closing tax loopholes and limiting deductions .\n\u201c The president is the only party that has put forward a plan that has specificity on both the spending and revenue side , \u201d Mr. Carney said . \u201c We have not seen in any detail from the Republicans , including from the offer that was put forward by the speaker in his letter , the kind of detail that would allow us to assess the proposal . \u201d\nHe said the GOP offer of $ 800 billion is \u201c far , far short of the necessary revenue for a deal that achieves $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s trip comes a day before the Michigan legislature is expected to complete work on a right-to-work bill , which Republican Gov . Snyder could sign into law before the end of the week .\nSupporters say the labor law change , which would exempt police officers and firefighters , would improve the climate for businesses looking to invest in Michigan , whose economy was badly hurt by the long-term decline of the American auto industry and by the recent deep recession . Unemployment , at 9.1 percent in October , ranks 45th among the states , although it has come down from above 11 percent in recent years .\nMr. Obama said right-to-work laws \u201c don \u2019 t have to do with economics . \u201d\n\u201c They have everything to do with politics , \u201d he said . \u201c What they \u2019 re really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money . You only have to look to Michigan , where workers were instrumental in reviving the auto industry , to see how unions have helped build , not just a stronger middle class , but a stronger America . \u201d\nBefore Mr. Obama arrived , Mr. Snyder met privately with some Democratic members of the state \u2019 s congressional delegation in Detroit , including Sens .
