The mood on the flight back to Washington on Sunday night was celebratory , according to aides . The president and his senior staff monitored cable news coverage , and Trump called friends and allies to get their feedback .\nTrump even sat in the cockpit of Air Force One for the landing at Joint Base Andrews .\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump felt vindicated by the news . \u201c He \u2019 s just very happy with how it all turned out , \u201d Gidley said .\nBy the time Trump got back to the White House on Sunday night , his sense of relief was palpable . \u201c I just want to tell you , America is the greatest place on Earth , \u201d he told reporters waiting on the South Lawn .\nThe president learned about Mueller \u2019 s conclusions just like the rest of the world : by reading Barr \u2019 s letter . Trump huddled with his lawyers in his private quarters at Mar-a-Lago after wrapping up an afternoon of golf with Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the recipients of Barr \u2019 s letter , former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney .\nAs the lawyers , Pat Cipollone and Emmet Flood , ran through Barr \u2019 s letter , Trump perked up , delighted at what he was hearing .\n\u201c This is very good , \u201d the president said , according to an aide .\nSunday \u2019 s news marked a rare high point for the president , who has weathered a wave of damaging episodes , from the recent Senate vote rebuking his order declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border to allegations of an illicit affair with a porn star .\nTrump , who has obsessed over the investigation in private for months , was quick to declare an unmitigated victory , claiming he was exonerated when the letter explicitly said he was not . The president and his aides strategically repeated the word \u201c exonerated \u201d after the letter \u2019 s release .\nAsked why the president kept saying he \u2019 d been exonerated despite the report \u2019 s saying that was not the case , Gidley told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One : \u201c Prosecutors don \u2019 t exonerate , they prosecute . They don \u2019 t prove a negative . That \u2019 s just silly . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s allies quickly launched a public I-told-you-so campaign , arguing that Democrats and the media were blinded by their alleged disdain for the president .\n\u201c After more than 2 years of non-stop conspiracy theories from CNN , MSNBC , BuzzFeed and the rest of the mainstream media , as well as daily lies and smears coming from Democrats in Washington , the Mueller Report proves what those of us with sane minds have known all along , there was ZERO collusion with Russia , \u201d the president \u2019 s son Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement .\nHe continued : \u201c Sadly , instead of apologizing for needlessly destabilizing the country in a transparent attempt to delegitimize the 2016 election , it \u2019 s clear that the Collusion Truthers in the media and the Democrat Party are only going to double down on their sick and twisted conspiracy theories moving forward . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s campaign manager , Brad Parscale , used the report to construct a new message against the Democratic Party ahead of 2020 , arguing that Mueller \u2019 s findings proved that Democrats \u201c failed once and they will fail again \u201d in their efforts to prove wrongdoing by the president .\n\u201c Their dirty tricks have not ended , \u201d Parscale said in a statement that accused Democrats of pursuing a \u201c frantic , chaotic , conspiracy-laden roller coaster for two years . \u201d\nBarr \u2019 s letter comes after Trump spent a relaxing weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club , playing golf and socializing with his longtime defenders . Aides said he was in good spirits , buoyed by the widespread belief among his supporters that the final report would be a bust .\nIn lieu of his typical tirades against what he called the Mueller \u201c witch hunt , \u201d he dashed off a pair of simple tweets Friday morning , breaking an unusual , nearly 40-hour streak of Twitter silence .\n\u201c Good Morning , Have A Great Day ! \u201d he wrote just after 8 a.m. , followed by , \u201c MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ! \u201d Trump later made the short trek to his nearby golf course for a round with Mulvaney , Graham and Gowdy .\nWhite House aides and others close to Trump insisted early Sunday that the president was in good spirits , despite the impending release of a summary of Mueller \u2019 s findings . It helped that Trump began the day in his favorite weekend getaway , mingling with like-minded Mar-a-Lago guests and spending hours on the golf course away from cable news and Twitter , which has often set the president off .\n\u201c The president is in a remarkably good mood , \u201d Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Sunday morning . \u201c He \u2019 s never terribly bothered by these things . The only time the president has ever been bothered is when they go after other people . When they go after the people that work with him , he feels they \u2019 re paying a very unfair price . \u201d\nIn the hours leading up to the public release of Mueller \u2019 s findings , Trump received overwhelming reassurance from senior advisers , attorneys and friends that he shouldn \u2019 t be worried , according to people familiar with the matter .\nTo bolster their case , many of those same confidants pointed to the revelation that Mueller \u2019 s office would not recommend any further indictments . Critics of the president have long questioned whether any of his family members who served on Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign would become entangled in Mueller \u2019 s finding , with a particular focus on the president \u2019 s eldest son .\nSpeaking before the release of Barr \u2019 s letter , Giuliani said he was not concerned that Mueller still had sealed indictments related to the Russia investigation , after a senior Justice Department official told reporters on Friday that the special counsel would not be filing any new indictments tied to his investigation . Barr \u2019 s statement on Sunday put that question to rest .\nSome Trump advisers were shocked that he resisted tweeting about the pending Mueller news for much of the weekend . But aides said Trump was largely pleased with public criticism of Mueller over the weekend from his friends and advisers and didn \u2019 t feel compelled to join in .\nThe first official statement from the White House about the report \u2019 s findings came from White House press secretary Sanders , not Trump , who is often the first administration official to weigh in on breaking news \u2014 usually via Twitter .\nThe president \u2019 s supporters took glee in publicly bashing Democrats and reporters for spending so much time obsessing over the Mueller investigation .\n\u201c Mainstream media now at a crossroads . Will they admit fault for fake Russia hoax and go back to actual journalism or continue with their @ realDonaldTrump Derangement Syndrome , \u201d David Bossie , a Trump ally , wrote on Twitter soon after news broke that Mueller had completed his investigation . \u201c I think I know the answer . \u201d\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel called for Democrats to put an end to \u201c their baseless investigations and political crusade against President Trump for the good of the country. \u201d At least two investigations involving the president \u2019 s inaugural committee and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office for the Southern District of New York remain ongoing , neither of which is controlled by congressional Democrats .\nBarr , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and their senior aides spent Saturday reviewing Mueller \u2019 s report before the release of the summary on Sunday afternoon . Justice Department officials are also embarking on a larger review of the whole Mueller document amid a clamor from lawmakers for its near complete release .\nBarr said in his Friday letter to Congress that he \u2019 d be consulting with the special counsel about what information he could release to Congress and the public about the nearly two-year-old Russia investigation . At the same time , Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said the special counsel planned to conclude his service in the \u201c coming days \u201d while a few support staff remain on board to shutter the office .\nCarr also confirmed on Sunday morning that plans were being implemented to hand off Mueller \u2019 s active cases , with the U.S. attorney \u2019 s office in Washington , D.C. , taking over Roger Stone \u2019 s trial , which is slated to begin in early November , and the sentencing for Rick Gates that has been repeatedly delayed over the last year while the former Trump campaign deputy cooperated in several ongoing investigations .\nFederal prosecutors in Washington will also handle Mueller \u2019 s case against Concord Management and Consulting , Carr said . The Russian-based company , led by a close associate of President Vladimir Putin , has hired American lawyers and is demanding a trial to fight back against charges that it helped orchestrate the massive online campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election .\nNo final decisions have been made yet , Carr added , over who will take the lead on two other high-profile active Mueller cases : the sentencing for Michael Flynn , the former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI , and efforts to force compliance with a subpoena against Andrew Miller , a Stone associate who last month lost in federal appeals court in his attempt to have the Mueller appointment tossed out as unconstitutional .",
