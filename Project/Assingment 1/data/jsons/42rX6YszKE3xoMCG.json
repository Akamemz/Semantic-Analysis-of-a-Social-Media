    "content": "Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic , more than 90,000 health care workers have been infected with the virus , and many have died . To name a few , these have included : a beloved doctor who came out of retirement , a patient transporter in Illinois , a pharmacist in upstate New York , and a nursing home worker . And those are just the deaths from physical illness and don \u2019 t take into account mental health consequences .\nIf you follow the news , you \u2019 ll read and hear over and over again that we are at \u201c war \u201d with the virus and that physicians like us , along with other essential workers , are soldiers in battle .\nThe term \u201c front-line workers , \u201d which has been used to describe those in health care during this pandemic , comes from the military , describing people putting their bodies at the front of the battalion , facing down the enemy . \u201c Redeployment \u201d has been used for physicians and nurses being asked to practice in areas outside of their specialty in response to the demands of the pandemic . Even President Donald Trump has made this comparison , saying health care workers are \u201c running into death just like soldiers run into bullets in a true sense , I see that with the doctors and the nurses and so many of the people that go into those hospitals , it \u2019 s incredible to see , it \u2019 s a beautiful thing to see . \u201d\nUsing this analogy is understandable . War metaphors are frequently used to describe diseases . Wartime physicians have compared the actual daily work , the frenetic environment , and the sheer volume of death , code blues , and tragedy we are currently experiencing to the chaos and trauma of combat .\nAll this makes it tempting , this Memorial Day , to hold front-line workers we \u2019 ve lost in this pandemic up against the sacrifices of fallen soldiers . But comparing doctors and nurses to troops is not a fair or helpful comparison .\nThough both soldiers and health care workers prioritize duty and service to others , health care workers do not enter their jobs with the expectation that they will be asked to put their own lives ( not to mention the lives of their families ) on the line to care for patients . Medical students , who must train in hospitals in order to graduate on time , did not expect that they would risk exposure to Covid-19 as a part of their training ( and even have to waive liability for it ) . This is not business as usual .\nJust as it would be unwise to go into war without weapons and appropriate armor , we do not usually go to work without effective treatments for our patients or protection for ourselves . We still do not have enough personal protective equipment ; beyond masks , we also need gloves , gowns , and hair and eye protection . We still do not have enough testing or even hand sanitizer . We also do not have any preventative measures or therapies for a health care worker who contracts the coronavirus , thereby forcing some to isolate from their families and put themselves at risk indefinitely .\nThere is little guidance as to how to protect people from catching the coronavirus , and we are still sorely lacking reliable data on how best to care for patients who have it . The day-to-day decision-making on the ground as a health care worker is ever-changing as the science is evolving . This leads to significant uncertainty as to what optimal medical care is . Should we place patients on a ventilator early or wait as long as we can ? Should we put them on blood thinners or does that lead to too much bleeding ? Should we treat them with tocilizumab or remdesivir or the latest drug of the week ? Everyone is desperate for a solution but no one knows what to do .\nYet , often the public chooses not to turn to science for guidance . On top of worrying about treating the patients we have in the hospital , we also worry that many people listen to the off-the-cuff recommendations of government officials and either begin taking the wrong medication for the wrong reasons , or inject something like a disinfectant , which is dangerous . This is all happening against the background of an uncoordinated federal public health strategy . Moving forward , we have , at best , vague plans for \u201c safe \u201d reopening . Even masks , which are safe and lower risk , are not currently widely accepted , partly because there is no unity among our leaders on their utility . As if this were not already enough to rattle even the most serene among us , many hospitals have also implemented pay cuts and furloughs , even for front-line staff .\nWhile images of health care workers running into death may seem \u201c beautiful \u201d to some , frequently hailing health care workers as heroes and praising our sacrifices suggests that our lost colleagues were expected to be human collateral damage in the fight . As if the California nurse who ran into a code blue to save a patient and died from lack of PPE is a martyr whose tragic death should be celebrated . In reality , as we \u2019 ve argued before , none of us chose to be in this position . Rather , we have been thrust into roles where we have to risk ourselves and our families , largely because leadership has failed , and continues to fail , to protect us .\nWith stressor after stressor compounding , it feels more useful , in a sense , to compare health care workers instead to the walking wounded . While some have suffered from physical illnesses , not all of our scars are visible . Working without adequate PPE , with few tools at our disposal to treat patients , and feeling unsupported by the government has taken a toll on our mental health .\nSo has all the tragedy we \u2019 ve witnessed . Just as you can \u2019 t see what soldiers have experienced , you don \u2019 t see a health care worker \u2019 s memory of a patient \u2019 s son \u2019 s crying face as he said goodbye to his unconscious father through the phone . You don \u2019 t see her memory of being unable to touch her wife or children , even in her own home . And you don \u2019 t see the images of those patients taking their last breaths before leaving this world . But that is what many of us are carrying with us , everywhere we go . These patients and their families are with us at the grocery store . They are with us when we try to sleep . And they are there , reminding us of our own fragility , when we try to spend time with our own loved ones .\nHealth care workers may not have enlisted , and we may not be in a real war , but we have served . Like soldiers , we are traumatized by our experiences in a way that those who haven \u2019 t been on the front lines with us can really understand .
