It traces the evolution of both political parties from the aftermath of World War I to the present . What is especially interesting is how , following the death of John F. Kennedy , the Democratic Party turned away from traditional liberalism , when Democrats still believed in American exceptionalism . JFK would have been considered a raging conservative today , as he believed in lower taxes , a strong national defense , and the pre-eminence of the United States ' place in the world as a force for good .\nDemocrats believed back then that progress ( `` the Progressive Era '' ) was meant for everyone to get ahead in life through hard work within the American capitalistic system . They also believed , as did the Republicans , in social safety nets just for the very poor . Kennedy , however , was initially ambivalent about Civil Rights legislation ( that actually began being promoted by his predecessor Eisenhower , a Republican ) but opened up to it out of political pressure and expediency .\nFollowing Kennedy 's assassination , Lyndon Johnson carried on Kennedy 's `` legacy '' and successfully pushed through congressional passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 , with a larger percentage of Republicans supporting it then Democrats . But Kennedy was mythologized for many years as a martyr by a large number of liberal writers and other opinion-makers , who insisted that sinister right-wing forces were behind his demise , therefore validating their narrative and cementing the image that America is a bad and evil place . In the book , it categorically and articulately demonstrates how the left successfully inverted what really happened into something that was not true , that in turn changed history for the worse by putting political division on an ever widening trajectory .\nOver the course of the twentieth century , liberalism succeeded in rewriting the Constitution , building political coalitions around public spending , insinuating itself within the interstices of government , and gaining control of key institutions that manufacture and legitimize political opinion .\nOut of the tumultuous 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago , the Democratic Party institutionalized identity politics based on grievance along with anti-Americanism \u2013 that is , the United States was and still is responsible for all of the problems in the world both at home and abroad .
