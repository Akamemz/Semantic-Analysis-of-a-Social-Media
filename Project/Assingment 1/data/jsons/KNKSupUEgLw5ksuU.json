    "content": "( CNN ) - The Internal Revenue Service spent millions of taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners ' commissions to speakers ' fees to guest prizes to parody videos at a 2010 conference , an audit of the agency shows .\nThe beleaguered agency - already snared in controversy over its targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status - spent $ 4.1 million on a 2010 conference in Anaheim , California , with `` questionable expenses '' comprising much of the budget , according to the report released Tuesday by the Treasury Department 's inspector general for tax administration .\nThe audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $ 3.2 million - came from unused funds allocated for hiring . This was in the same year that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax-exempt office , in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle the overwhelming amount of applications pouring in that year .\n`` Effective cost management is especially important given the current economic environment and focus on Government efficiency , '' Inspector General J. Russell George said in a statement . `` Certain of the IRS 's expenses associated with the Anaheim conference do not appear to be a good use of taxpayer funds . ''\nThe August 2010 conference , held by the Small Business/Self-Employed division , had 2,600 attendees at three hotels in Anaheim . The audit states that none of the guests were required to document their attendance at the training sessions .\nWhile the division made 1,516 hires that year , not all of them were on board the full year , so the division used the unused money for the three-day conference . Managers also indicated the used additional training funds for the event .\nThe audit notes that the IRS\u2013a stickler for record keeping\u2013could only provide documentation for $ 4.1 million . The division estimated it actually spent $ 4,297,285 , but could not source that additional amount , according to the report .\nThe IRS used event planners instead of IRS employees or contractors to set up the conference , giving no incentive to get lower rates and leaving the government to pay $ 135 per night for all rooms . Instead of working for favorable room rates , both event planners got $ 66,500 in commission from the hotels , according to the audit .\nOther expenses included more than $ 135,000 on outside speakers\u2013including a $ 17,000 fee for a speaker who created paintings on stage to make his point that one must free `` the thought process to find creative solutions to challenges . ''\n`` The speaker created six paintings at these two keynote sessions ( three at each session ) .
