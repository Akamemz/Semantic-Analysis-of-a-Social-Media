The man who sold them the firm , James Park , never collects on an $ 8 million note , according to The New Republic .\n2010\u201311 : Rosemont Seneca takes off like a rocket in its ability to secure meetings with wealthy Chinese investors . From Peter Schweitzer \u2019 s Secret Empires : How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends :\nLess than a year after opening Rosemont Seneca \u2019 s doors , Hunter Biden and Devon Archer were in China having secured access at the highest levels . Thornton Group \u2019 s account of the meeting on their Chinese-language website is telling : Chinese executives \u201c extended their warm welcome \u201d to the \u201c Thornton Group , with its U.S. partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden ( second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden ) . \u201d The purpose of the meetings was to \u201c explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity. \u201d Curiously , details about the meeting do not appear on their English-language website .\nAlso , according to the Thornton Group , the three Americans met with the largest and most powerful government-fund leaders in China \u2014 even though Rosemont was both new and small . To put these meetings in perspective , it was as if the son of the Chinese premier held a single meeting with the heads of Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , J.P. Morgan , Merrill Lynch , and Blackstone . Except , in this case , these were government entities with trillions of dollars of capital to invest . The delegate spent two days meeting with the top executives of China \u2019 s sovereign wealth fund , social-security fund , and largest banks . Hunter posed with them for a series of pictures .\nSometime in 2012 : Devon Archer and Hunter Biden begin meetings with \u201c Jonathan Li , who ran a Chinese private-equity fund , Bohai Capital , about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital , \u201d according to The New Yorker .\nJune 2013 : Li , Archer , and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund , which they named BHR Partners , and , in November , they signed contracts related to the deal . Hunter Biden becomes an unpaid member of BHR \u2019 s board but will not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father leaves the White House .\nAugust 19 , 2013 : New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his column , \u201c In Washington , the line between lobbying and bribery is not clear-cut . Until 2008 , R. Hunter Biden , son of then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , lobbied Congress regularly . \u201d\nDecember 4 , 2013 : Hunter Biden joins his father on Air Force Two on a trip to China , where his father is meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping . Hunter arranges for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation \u2019 s hotel . Afterward , Hunter and Li have what both parties describe as a social meeting .\nAccording to The New Yorker , at this time other Obama-administration officials weren \u2019 t comfortable with Hunter Biden \u2019 s business ties in China , but they did not confront the vice president about the matter :\nHunter \u2019 s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time , but some of Biden \u2019 s advisers were worried that Hunter , by meeting with a business associate during his father \u2019 s visit , would expose the Vice-President to criticism . The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter \u2019 s behavior invited questions about whether he \u201c was leveraging access for his benefit , which just wasn \u2019 t done in that White House . Optics really mattered , and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close , even if nothing nefarious was going on. \u201d When I asked members of Biden \u2019 s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President , several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so . \u201c Everyone who works for him has been screamed at , \u201d a former adviser told me .\nDecember 2013 : \u201c Less than two weeks later , Hunter Biden \u2019 s firm inked a $ 1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government \u2019 s Bank of China , \u201d author and investigator Peter Schweizer says . \u201c The deal was later expanded to $ 1.5 billion . In short , the Chinese government funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president. \u201d But The New Yorker quotes a BHR representative who says the deal was signed before the vice president \u2019 s trip to China , a business license came through shortly after , and Hunter was not a signatory .\nApril 2014 : Hunter Biden joins the board of Burisma Holdings . Alan Apter , a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who was chairman of Burisma , said at the time , \u201c The company \u2019 s strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices , and we \u2019 re delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals. \u201d Biden \u2019 s primary duty is to attend board meetings and energy forums in Europe once or twice a year , and he is paid $ 50,000 per month .\nMay 13 , 2014 : At the White House , Press Secretary Jay Carney responds to a question about Hunter Biden \u2019 s joining the board and the appearance of a potential conflict of interest :\nI would refer you to the vice president \u2019 s office . I saw those reports . You know , Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens , and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the vice president or president . But I would refer you to the vice president \u2019 s office .\nThe same day , at a State Department press briefing , AP reporter Matt Lee asks , \u201c Does this building diplomatically have any concerns about potential perceptions of conflict or/cronyism \u2014 which is what you \u2019 ve often accused the Russians of doing ? \u201d\n\u201c No , he \u2019 s a private citizen , \u201d State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki replied .\nMay 14 , 2014 : The U.K.-based Guardian newspaper blasts Biden \u2019 s new position , snarking , \u201c Somebody needs to get involved in Ukraine \u2019 s corporate governance , and it might as well be a clutch of rich , well-connected American dudes with weird first names. \u201d Washington Post columnist Adam Taylor writes :\nThe appointment of the vice president \u2019 s son to a Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best , nefarious at worst . No matter how qualified Biden is , it ties into the idea that U.S. foreign policy is self-interested , and that \u2019 s a narrative Vladimir Putin has pushed during Ukraine \u2019 s crisis with references to Iraq and Libya .\nSometime in 2015 : Chris Heinz ends his relationship with Rosemont Seneca .\nDecember 8 , 2015 : Writing in the New York Times , James Risen says of the vice president \u2019 s trip to Ukraine :\nThe credibility of the vice president \u2019 s anticorruption message may have been undermined by the association of his son , Hunter Biden , with one of Ukraine \u2019 s largest natural gas companies , Burisma Holdings , and with its owner , Mykola Zlochevsky , who was Ukraine \u2019 s ecology minister under former President Viktor F. Yanukovych before he was forced into exile .\nDecember 11 , 2015 : A New York Times editorial praises Biden \u2019 s message to the Ukrainian government but notes :\nThe credibility of Mr. Biden \u2019 s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company , Burisma Holdings , which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices . A spokesman for the son , Hunter Biden , argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance . That may be so . But Burisma \u2019 s owner , Mykola Zlochevsky , has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine . It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father \u2019 s efforts to help Ukraine . This is not a board he should be sitting on .\nA few days ago , Risen wrote at The Intercept that Biden \u2019 s message on the trip was being completely misinterpreted :\nThe then\u2013vice president issued his demands for greater anti-corruption measures by the Ukrainian government despite the possibility that those demands would actually increase \u2014 not lessen \u2014 the chances that Hunter Biden and Burisma would face legal trouble in Ukraine .\nDecember 2016 : Hunter Biden and his wife , Kathleen , file for divorce . The divorce becomes official April 14 , 2017 . Sometime when Biden is \u201c in the middle of the divorce , \u201d he meets the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming . As CNN described , \u201c at its height , Ye \u2019 s company , CEFC China Energy , aligned itself so closely with the Chinese government that it was often hard to distinguish between the two . \u201d\nJanuary 20 , 2017 : Joe Biden \u2019 s second term as vice president ends .\nMay 2017 : Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and Hunter Biden meet privately at a hotel in Miami . Biden says he offered to use his contacts to help \u201c identify investment opportunities for Ye \u2019 s company CEFC China Energy , in liquified natural gas projects in the United States. \u201d After the dinner , Ye sends a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter \u2019 s hotel room with a card thanking him for the meeting . During the divorce proceedings , Hunter Biden and his ex-wife Kathleen dispute the value of the diamond ; he says it is worth $ 10,000 , she contends it is worth $ 80,000 .\nBiden denied that the diamond could be considered a bribe . \u201c What would they be bribing me for ? My dad wasn \u2019 t in office. \u201d Hunter Biden told The New Yorker he gave the diamond to his associates and doesn \u2019 t know what happened to it .\nAlso during the divorce proceedings , Kathleen \u201c requested that Hunter \u2019 s access to their joint assets be limited because the couple had a double mortgage and owed more than $ 300,000 in back taxes . \u201d\nSummer 2017 : Hunter Biden begins negotiating a deal for Ye \u2019 s company CEFC to invest in a liquefied-natural-gas project in Louisiana . Ye tells Biden that he \u2019 s worried about federal authorities \u2019 looking into one of his business associates , Patrick Ho . Hunter agrees to represent Ho as his lawyer .\nOctober 2017 : After having an unpaid role on the company \u2019 s board since 2013 , Hunter Biden acquired a financial stake in BHR , a 10 percent equity interest that was worth $ 430,000 as of July 2019 , according to Hunter Biden \u2019 s lawyer , George Mesires . At least half of the firm \u2019 s stake is owned by Chinese entities , according to business records .\nNovember 18 , 2017 : Patrick Ho is arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport on bribery and money-laundering charges . He makes a phone call to James Biden , Joe Biden \u2019 s younger brother , and asked Biden for a lawyer . ( Hunter Biden has not practiced criminal law . )\nMarch 2018 : Ye Jianming , the former boss of CEFC China Energy who gave Biden the diamond , vanishes from public sight . The Chinese government detained him for questioning , but \u201c no Chinese authority has released any information about him , and he has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing . \u201d\nJune 28 , 2018 : Devon Archer , who co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners with Hunter Biden back in 2009 , is convicted of \u201c conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud \u201d for allegedly defrauding investors in sham Native American tribal bonds . A few months later , the conviction is overturned and a new trial is ordered .\nNovember 2018 : U.S. prosecutors allege that a nonprofit funded by Ye Jianming \u2014 the man who gave Hunter Biden that large diamond , who is still missing and believed detained by the Chinese government \u2014 had used its United Nations status to offer millions in bribes to African leaders .\nHunter would later tell The New Yorker that he doesn \u2019 t see Ye as a \u201c shady character at all , \u201d and he characterized the outcome as \u201c bad luck . \u201d\nMarch 25 , 2019 : Patrick Ho , Biden \u2019 s former legal client , is sentenced to three years in prison for international bribery and money-laundering offenses . He was convicted of a multi-year , multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC China Energy Company Limited .\nApril 1 , 2019 : Writing in The Hill , John Solomon quotes Ukrainian former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin , telling him that , before he was dismissed , he was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings , and that his plans included \u201c interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board , including Hunter Biden . \u201d\nMay 3 , 2019 : The Intercept reports that Hunter Biden \u2019 s investment company in China , known as Bohai Harvest RST , invested in a company called Face++ , which develops facial-recognition software . That facial-recognition software is used in an app that \u201c provides [ Chinese ] law enforcement with easy , daily access to data detailing the religious activity , blood type , and even the amount of electricity used by ethnic minority Muslims living in the western province of Xinjiang . \u201d\nMay 16 , 2019 : Yuriy Lutsenko , the current prosecutor general , tells Bloomberg News that neither Hunter Biden nor Burisma was now the focus of an investigation . \u201c Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now , we do not see any wrongdoing . A company can pay however much it wants to its board . \u201d\nMay 20 , 2019 : The New York Times reports , \u201c A lawyer for Hunter Biden said he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip \u201d in December 2013 .\n[ Christopher ] Heinz argued to [ Devon ] Archer , who like Hunter Biden had joined Burisma \u2019 s board , that the posts created the appearance of selling influence , according to a person familiar with the conversation . Mr. Archer did not heed the advice . And Mr. Heinz , who was not involved in the China or Ukraine efforts , began decoupling his business interests from those of Mr. Biden and Mr. Archer .\nThis conversation must have occurred sometime in 2013 or 2014 .\nJuly 1 , 2019 : Hunter Biden tells The New Yorker in an interview , \u201c I \u2019 ve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck . I never considered it struggling , but it has always been a high-wire act . \u201d\nJuly 22 , 2019 : Hunter Biden issues a new statement to the Washington Post about his time on the Burisma Holdings board : \u201c At no time have I discussed with my father the company \u2019 s business or my board service . \u201d\nAll I can say is that the appointment of Hunter Biden as a member of the Board of Directors of the energy company is rather questionable from the point of view of effectiveness . After all , this person had no work experience either in Ukraine or in the energy sector . . . . The activities of Burisma , the involvement of his son , Hunter Biden , and the [ prosecutor general \u2019 s office ] investigators on his tail , are the only , I emphasize , the only motives for organizing my resignation .\nOther anti-corruption activists in Ukraine strongly disagree with Shokin \u2019 s assessment of why he was dismissed .",

Thornton Group\u2019s account of the meeting on their Chinese-language website is telling: Chinese executives \u201cextended their warm welcome\u201d to the \u201cThornton Group, with its U.S. partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).\u201d The purpose of the meetings was to \u201cexplore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.\u201d Curiously, details about the meeting do not appear on their English-language website.\n\nAlso, according to the Thornton Group, the three Americans met with the largest and most powerful government-fund leaders in China \u2014 even though Rosemont was both new and small. To put these meetings in perspective, it was as if the son of the Chinese premier held a single meeting with the heads of Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, and Blackstone. Except, in this case, these were government entities with trillions of dollars of capital to invest. The delegate spent two days meeting with the top executives of China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, social-security fund, and largest banks. Hunter posed with them for a series of pictures.\n\nSometime in 2012: Devon Archer and Hunter Biden begin meetings with \u201cJonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital,\u201d according to The New Yorker.\n\nJune 2013: Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter Biden becomes an unpaid member of BHR\u2019s board but will not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father leaves the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 19, 2013: New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his column, \u201cIn Washington, the line between lobbying and bribery is not clear-cut. Until 2008, R. Hunter Biden, son of then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., lobbied Congress regularly.\u201d\n\nDecember 4, 2013: Hunter Biden joins his father on Air Force Two on a trip to China, where his father is meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Hunter arranges for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation\u2019s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li have what both parties describe as a social meeting.\n\nAccording to The New Yorker, at this time other Obama-administration officials weren\u2019t comfortable with Hunter Biden\u2019s business ties in China, but they did not confront the vice president about the matter:\n\nHunter\u2019s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Biden\u2019s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father\u2019s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter\u2019s behavior invited questions about whether he \u201cwas leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasn\u2019t done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.\u201d When I asked members of Biden\u2019s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. \u201cEveryone who works for him has been screamed at,\u201d a former adviser told me.\n\nDecember 2013: \u201cLess than two weeks later, Hunter Biden\u2019s firm inked a $1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China,\u201d author and investigator Peter Schweizer says. \u201cThe deal was later expanded to $1.5 billion. In short, the Chinese government funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.\u201d But The New Yorker quotes a BHR representative who says the deal was signed before the vice president\u2019s trip to China, a business license came through shortly after, and Hunter was not a signatory.\n\nApril 2014: Hunter Biden joins the board of Burisma Holdings. Alan Apter, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who was chairman of Burisma, said at the time, \u201cThe company\u2019s strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices, and we\u2019re delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals.\u201d Biden\u2019s primary duty is to attend board meetings and energy forums in Europe once or twice a year, and he is paid $50,000 per month.\n\nApter added, \u201cThis is totally based on merit.\u201d\n\nMay 13, 2014: At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney responds to a question about Hunter Biden\u2019s joining the board and the appearance of a potential conflict of interest:\n\nI would refer you to the vice president\u2019s office. I saw those reports. You know, Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens, and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the vice president or president. But I would refer you to the vice president\u2019s office.\n\nThe same day, at a State Department press briefing, AP reporter Matt Lee asks, \u201cDoes this building diplomatically have any concerns about potential perceptions of conflict or/cronyism \u2014 which is what you\u2019ve often accused the Russians of doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s a private citizen,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki replied.\n\nMay 14, 2014: The U.K.-based Guardian newspaper blasts Biden\u2019s new position, snarking, \u201cSomebody needs to get involved in Ukraine\u2019s corporate governance, and it might as well be a clutch of rich, well-connected American dudes with weird first names.\u201d Washington Post columnist Adam Taylor writes:\n\nThe appointment of the vice president\u2019s son to a Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst. No matter how qualified Biden is, it ties into the idea that U.S. foreign policy is self-interested, and that\u2019s a narrative Vladimir Putin has pushed during Ukraine\u2019s crisis with references to Iraq and Libya.\n\nSometime in 2015: Chris Heinz ends his relationship with Rosemont Seneca.\n\nDecember 8, 2015: Writing in the New York Times, James Risen says of the vice president\u2019s trip to Ukraine:\n\nThe credibility of the vice president\u2019s anticorruption message may have been undermined by the association of his son, Hunter Biden, with one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies, Burisma Holdings, and with its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, who was Ukraine\u2019s ecology minister under former President Viktor F. Yanukovych before he was forced into exile.\n\nDecember 11, 2015: A New York Times editorial praises Biden\u2019s message to the Ukrainian government but notes:\n\nThe credibility of Mr. Biden\u2019s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father\u2019s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.\n\nA few days ago, Risen wrote at The Intercept that Biden\u2019s message on the trip was being completely misinterpreted:\n\nThe then\u2013vice president issued his demands for greater anti-corruption measures by the Ukrainian government despite the possibility that those demands would actually increase \u2014 not lessen \u2014 the chances that Hunter Biden and Burisma would face legal trouble in Ukraine.\n\nDecember 2016: Hunter Biden and his wife, Kathleen, file for divorce. The divorce becomes official April 14, 2017. Sometime when Biden is \u201cin the middle of the divorce,\u201d he meets the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming. As CNN described, \u201cat its height, Ye\u2019s company, CEFC China Energy, aligned itself so closely with the Chinese government that it was often hard to distinguish between the two.\u201d\n\nJanuary 20, 2017: Joe Biden\u2019s second term as vice president ends.\n\nMay 2017: Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and Hunter Biden meet privately at a hotel in Miami. Biden says he offered to use his contacts to help \u201cidentify investment opportunities for Ye\u2019s company CEFC China Energy, in liquified natural gas projects in the United States.\u201d After the dinner, Ye sends a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter\u2019s hotel room with a card thanking him for the meeting. During the divorce proceedings, Hunter Biden and his ex-wife Kathleen dispute the value of the diamond; he says it is worth $10,000, she contends it is worth $80,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden denied that the diamond could be considered a bribe. \u201cWhat would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn\u2019t in office.\u201d Hunter Biden told The New Yorker he gave the diamond to his associates and doesn\u2019t know what happened to it.\n\nAlso during the divorce proceedings, Kathleen \u201crequested that Hunter\u2019s access to their joint assets be limited because the couple had a double mortgage and owed more than $300,000 in back taxes.\u201d\n\nSummer 2017: Hunter Biden begins negotiating a deal for Ye\u2019s company CEFC to invest in a liquefied-natural-gas project in Louisiana. Ye tells Biden that he\u2019s worried about federal authorities\u2019 looking into one of his business associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter agrees to represent Ho as his lawyer.\n\nOctober 2017: After having an unpaid role on the company\u2019s board since 2013, Hunter Biden acquired a financial stake in BHR, a 10 percent equity interest that was worth $430,000 as of July 2019, according to Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires. At least half of the firm\u2019s stake is owned by Chinese entities, according to business records.\n\nNovember 18, 2017: Patrick Ho is arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport on bribery and money-laundering charges. He makes a phone call to James Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s younger brother, and asked Biden for a lawyer. (Hunter Biden has not practiced criminal law.)\n\nMarch 2018: Ye Jianming, the former boss of CEFC China Energy who gave Biden the diamond, vanishes from public sight. The Chinese government detained him for questioning, but \u201cno Chinese authority has released any information about him, and he has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nJune 28, 2018: Devon Archer, who co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners with Hunter Biden back in 2009, is convicted of \u201cconspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud\u201d for allegedly defrauding investors in sham Native American tribal bonds. A few months later, the conviction is overturned and a new trial is ordered.\n\nNovember 2018: U.S. prosecutors allege that a nonprofit funded by Ye Jianming \u2014 the man who gave Hunter Biden that large diamond, who is still missing and believed detained by the Chinese government \u2014 had used its United Nations status to offer millions in bribes to African leaders.\n\nHunter would later tell The New Yorker that he doesn\u2019t see Ye as a \u201cshady character at all,\u201d and he characterized the outcome as \u201cbad luck.\u201d\n\nMarch 25, 2019: Patrick Ho, Biden\u2019s former legal client, is sentenced to three years in prison for international bribery and money-laundering offenses. He was convicted of a multi-year, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC China Energy Company Limited.\n\nApril 1, 2019: Writing in The Hill, John Solomon quotes Ukrainian former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, telling him that, before he was dismissed, he was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, and that his plans included \u201cinterrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nMay 3, 2019: The Intercept reports that Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company in China, known as Bohai Harvest RST, invested in a company called Face++, which develops facial-recognition software. That facial-recognition software is used in an app that \u201cprovides [Chinese] law enforcement with easy, daily access to data detailing the religious activity, blood type, and even the amount of electricity used by ethnic minority Muslims living in the western province of Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nMay 16, 2019: Yuriy Lutsenko, the current prosecutor general, tells Bloomberg News that neither Hunter Biden nor Burisma was now the focus of an investigation. \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing. A company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d\n\nMay 20, 2019: The New York Times reports, \u201cA lawyer for Hunter Biden said he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip\u201d in December 2013.\n\nThe paper also reports:\n\n[Christopher] Heinz argued to [Devon] Archer, who like Hunter Biden had joined Burisma\u2019s board, that the posts created the appearance of selling influence, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Archer did not heed the advice. And Mr. Heinz, who was not involved in the China or Ukraine efforts, began decoupling his business interests from those of Mr. Biden and Mr. Archer.\n\nThis conversation must have occurred sometime in 2013 or 2014.\n\nJuly 1, 2019: Hunter Biden tells The New Yorker in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck. I never considered it struggling, but it has always been a high-wire act.\u201d\n\nJuly 22, 2019: Hunter Biden issues a new statement to the Washington Post about his time on the Burisma Holdings board: \u201cAt no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business or my board service.\u201d\n\nShokin tells the Post via email:\n\nAll I can say is that the appointment of Hunter Biden as a member of the Board of Directors of the energy company is rather questionable from the point of view of effectiveness. After all, this person had no work experience either in Ukraine or in the energy sector. . . . The activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the [prosecutor general\u2019s office] investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.\n\nOther anti-corruption activists in Ukraine strongly disagree with Shokin\u2019s assessment of why he was dismissed.",
