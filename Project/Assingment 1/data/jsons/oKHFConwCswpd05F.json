Edward Snowden , the man responsible for the most audacious national security leak ever , is the subject of a film up for best documentary feature , while more than 1,300 miles away from Hollywood , the closely watched trial of the man accused of killing the real \u201c American Sniper , \u201d up for best picture , goes on .\nThe Oscars were mostly quiet affairs , politically speaking \u2014 until Jane Fonda won best actress for \u201c Klute \u201d in 1972 .\nThree months before her infamous trip to Hanoi , the outspoken Vietnam War opponent surprised many when she kept quiet about her politics on the show , but sounded off on U.S. foreign policy in southeast Asia to reporters backstage .\n\u201c I was thinking that , while we \u2019 re all sitting there giving out awards , which are very important awards , there are murders being committed in our name in Indochina , \u201d she told the press . \u201c And I think everyone out there is aware of it as I am , and I think that everyone out there wants it to end as much as I do . And I didn \u2019 t think I needed to say it . I think we have had it . I really do . I think everyone feels that way . And I just didn \u2019 t think it needed to be said . \u201d\nIn 1975 , when the anti-Vietnam War film \u201c Hearts and Minds \u201d won best documentary , producer Bert Schneider used his acceptance speech to read a cable from Viet Cong official Dinh Ba Thi . Co-host Frank Sinatra was not pleased .\n\u201c It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated , \u201d Schneider said before reading the message , weeks before the fall of Saigon .\n\u201c Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam , \u201d Schneider read . \u201c These actions serve the legitimate interest of the American people and the Vietnamese people . Greetings of friendship to all the American people . \u201d\nLater in the show , Sinatra read aloud a note , purportedly from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences : \u201c I \u2019 ve been asked by the academy to make the following statement regarding a statement that was made by a winner . \u2018 We are not responsible for any political references made on the program , and we are sorry they had to take place this evening . \u2019 \u201d\nThe statement , however , was not from the academy but from co-host Bob Hope . Hope , who performed for U.S. troops for 50 years , scribbled out his own message and handed it to Sinatra , who was presenting the next award .\nSinatra \u2019 s \u201c Guys and Dolls \u201d co-star Marlon Brando made waves two years earlier when he declined his best actor award for \u201c The Godfather. \u201d In his place , a Native American activist named Sacheen Littlefeather walked to the stage and briefly explained Brando \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry \u2013 excuse me \u2013 and on television in movie reruns , and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee , \u201d she said , referring to the then-ongoing standoff between the federal government and armed Oglala Lakota with members of the American Indian Movement in South Dakota . Brando supported the AIM .\nThe audience reacted with a cascade of boos and a smattering of applause .\nFrom then on , the Academy banned speeches by proxy , except in rare instances when the winner had died .\nIn 1978 , the Jewish Defense League protested the supporting actress nomination of Vanessa Redgrave in \u201c Julia \u201d because the English actress had helped fund and narrate a documentary promoting Palestine . Redgrave portrayed anti-Nazi activist Lillian Hellman in the film .\nWhen John Travolta read her name as the winner , Redgrave rushed to the stage , thanking her co-star \u2014 Jane Fonda \u2014 and director .\nThen she denounced the people picketing her and burning her in effigy , and boos rained down on the stage . \u201c I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you \u2019 ve stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression , \u201d she proclaimed .\nScreenwriter and presenter Paddy Chayefsky blasted the remarks later in the show . \u201c I would like to say , personal opinion , of course , that I \u2019 m sick and tired of people exploiting the occasion of the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal political propaganda , \u201d he said , prompting applause .\nPresenters Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins drew the ire of the academy in 1993 when they departed from their script to address the U.S. government \u2019 s detention , at Guantanamo Bay , of HIV-positive Haitians fleeing a coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat . During the same show , Richard Gere expressed his hope that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was watching so he could address human rights violations in Tibet .\n\u201c The show \u2019 s about movies , about people \u2019 s work in movies , about entertainment . It \u2019 s not supposed to be about political activities around the world ( no matter ) how much individually we might support any one of those causes , \u201d Academy President Robert Rehme told the Los Angeles Times in the aftermath .\nSix years later , the Academy \u2019 s Board of Governors gave an honorary award to director Elia Kazan , whose cooperation with House Un-American Activities Committee under the cloud of McCarthyism the 1950s had left deep scars .\nWhile admitting past Communist Party involvement , Kazan refused to give names of other party members from his time at New York \u2019 s Group Theatre during his first testimony in January 1952 .\nConversations with well-placed Hollywood executives convinced him he would never work in the town again if he didn \u2019 t name names , Kazan wrote in his 1988 autobiography . In his second testimony later that year , he provided HUAC with the names of several party acquaintances , most of whom were already known . That didn \u2019 t matter \u2014 to many of his former friends , he became persona non grata .\nSo when Kazan was introduced to accept his Oscar , many in the audience sat with their arms crossed or on their hands . Others , like Steven Spielberg , quietly applauded in their seats . Some , including Rehme , gave him the customary standing ovation .\nDays after the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 , Michael Moore caused an uproar with his acceptance speech for documentary winner \u201c Bowling for Columbine. \u201d Moore invited other nominees in his category on stage \u201c in solidarity . \u201d\n\u201c We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times , \u201d he announced , as some in the audience sat in bewilderment and jeers came from backstage and elsewhere in the Kodak Theatre . \u201c We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president . We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons , whether it \u2019 s the fictition of duct tape or the fictitious of orange alerts . We are against this war , Mr. Bush ! Shame on you , Mr. Bush ! Shame on you ! \u201d\nWhen the film \u201c Milk \u201d won Oscars for best actor and original screenplay in 2009 , winners Sean Penn and Dustin Lance Black spoke out in favor of same-sex marriage . Three months earlier , Proposition 8 had passed in California , reinstating the state \u2019 s ban on gay marriage .\n\u201c For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight , I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren \u2019 s eyes if they continue that way of support , \u201d Penn said in his speech , channeling Harvey Milk , the man he played in the film . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to have equal rights for everyone . \u201d\nEarlier in the show , Black , who is gay , said that Milk would want him to tell \u201c all of the gay and lesbian kids out there \u201d that \u201c very soon , I promise you , you will have equal rights , federally , across this great nation of ours . \u201d\nSame-sex marriages resumed in California in June 2013 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling .\nThis year \u2019 s ceremony promises to have some fireworks of its own , with political talkers \u201c American Sniper \u201d and \u201c Selma \u201d among the eight films up for best picture . While neither is the odds-on favorite to claim that prize , political statements are likely in the offing for Sunday .\nGrossing more than $ 300 million at the U.S. box office , \u201c American Sniper \u201d is still the mainstream favorite : 38 percent said they \u2019 d vote for the film in a recent Vox Populi Polling survey .\nBased on the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle , who had 160 confirmed kills during multiple tours in Iraq , the Clint Eastwood-directed film starring Bradley Cooper collected six nominations and has generated a considerable amount of political controversy in the U.S .\nLiberals have charged that the film glorifies the Iraq war and snipers in general . Conservatives have praised it as a cultural victory .\nMichael Moore angered conservatives with his commentary on Twitter after the film \u2019 s wide release last month .\n\u201c My uncle killed by sniper in WW2 . We were taught snipers were cowards . Will shoot u in the back . Snipers aren \u2019 t heroes . And invaders r worse , \u201d the Oscar-winning filmmaker tweeted .\nSen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a former prisoner of war in Vietnam , called the statement \u201c idiotic \u201d and \u201c outrageous . \u201d\nThe real-world trial of Kyle \u2019 s murderer , Eddie Ray Routh , has been covered intensively by conservative news outlets . Last week , Routh \u2019 s attorneys said their client was insane when he shot and killed Kyle and another man at a firing range on Feb. 2 , 2013 .\nThe film itself is open to many interpretations , but Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall have complex thoughts about the Iraq war and might have something to say about the conflict , should either man make it onstage .\nThen there \u2019 s John Legend and Common , slated to perform their nominated song \u201c Glory \u201d from \u201c Selma , \u201d which references the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and alludes to \u201c hands up , don \u2019 t shoot \u201d protests following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , last August .\nDocumentary feature nominee \u201c Citizenfour \u201d follows NSA leaker Edward Snowden as he meets with journalist Glenn Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras in his Hong Kong hotel room as the Guardian published articles about the U.S. \u2019 massive global surveillance program .
