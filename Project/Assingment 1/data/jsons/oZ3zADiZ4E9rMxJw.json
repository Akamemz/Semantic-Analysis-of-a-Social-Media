    "content": "Americans fed up with eight years of a sluggish economy and a growing disconnect with their leaders in Washington voted Tuesday to send businessman and political novice Donald Trump to the White House , guaranteeing one of the biggest shakeups in political history .\nWins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gave him enough projected electoral votes to defeat former first lady , former senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , whose quarter-century in Washington \u2014 and the long list of stumbles , including a scandal over a secret email server \u2014 made her anathema for too many voters .\nMrs. Clinton had been seeking to make history as the first woman to win the White House , but instead the 70-year-old Mr. Trump made history of another sort , becoming the first person elected to the top job without having held a high government office or military command .\nHis victory upends a Washington establishment that voters said had lost touch with folks back home , and is a searing rebuke to President Obama , who had pleaded with voters that his hope-and-change agenda was at stake in this election .\nMr. Trump powered his campaign with a simple mantra to \u201c Make America great again \u201d and he vowed to live up to that charge as president , saying he would rebuild the country \u2019 s inner cities , improve care for veterans , double economic growth and forge alliances with other nations willing to work with him .\n\u201c We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us , \u201d he said . \u201c We will seek common ground , not hostility , partnership , not conflict . \u201d\nAfter running a brash and eccentric campaign that his critics called divisive , he struck a note of openness and conciliation Wednesday morning in claiming victory .\n\u201c It is time for us to come together as one united people , \u201d he said . \u201c I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton did not speak , and in fact her campaign manager John Podesta had earlier signaled she wouldn \u2019 t concede the race . But as the numbers came in , her path to victory eroded and she made an about-face , making a call to Mr. Trump .\nRecounting the call , Mr. Trump said he congratulated her on the campaign and on her time in government .\n\u201c Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time , and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country , \u201d he said .\nRepublicans shed seats in the House and Senate but will still keep majorities in both chambers , giving Mr. Trump a head start on his agenda . Obamacare would be among the first targets , Democrats predicted , while Mr. Trump would be under pressure to build the border wall he made a staple of his campaign .\nHe \u2019 ll also get the chance to nominate the next Supreme Court justice , vindicating Republican senators \u2019 decision to block Mr. Obama \u2019 s pick for nearly a year .\n\u201c This was a primal scream on the part of a lot of voters , \u201d David Axelrod , the architect of Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2008 victory , said on CNN as Mr. Trump racked up win after win .\nMr. Trump flipped a number of states Mr. Obama won and rebuilt most of the coalition that powered President George W. Bush to wins in 2000 and 2004 . He added Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to the GOP tally , but ceded Virginia , which went Democratic for the third straight election .\nThe map turned out to be surprisingly close to what Mr. Trump had predicted over the last few months , with the GOP proving competitive in rust-belt and Midwest states where he said the Obama economy was failing .\nExit polls also proved to be drastically off base Tuesday , predicting Mrs. Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates would win races that they ended up losing by wide margins .\nAnalysts said Mr. Trump tapped into white voters across the country who had felt ignored by Washington politicians and who turned out en masse to make themselves heard .\nStill , it wasn \u2019 t clear how much of a honeymoon Mr. Trump would enjoy . Voters in both parties were decidedly unhappy with what one man in Pennsylvania called a \u201c terrible choice of candidates . \u201d\nThose walking out of the polls were far more likely to be voting against someone rather than enthusiastic about their own pick .\n\u201c I think Donald Trump is an idiot , \u201d Pam Lamonaca , a 63-year-old caregiver , said as she voted in Delaware County , Pennsylvania .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t trust Hillary Clinton .
