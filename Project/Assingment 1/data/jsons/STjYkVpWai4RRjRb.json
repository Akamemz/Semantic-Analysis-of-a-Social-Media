How do you keep enemy surface to surface missiles from ever launching \u2014 or [ fly ] halfway to their target and then turn around and go home ? \u201d\nThe military services devote a lot of effort to defending their networks against cyberattacks and supporting the intelligence community , he said , but so far not enough pursuing cyber weapons they could wield the way they now deploy fighter squadrons or infantry battalions .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t thought of the domain in terms of our core missions robustly enough , and so that \u2019 s the focus we have right now , \u201d Welsh said . \u201c I \u2019 ve been calling it \u2018 Big Cyber. \u2019 How does the Air Force get into big Air Force cyber stuff ? \u2026 How do you create airpower through the cyber domain ? \u201d\nAnswering those questions and achieving something like Welsh \u2019 s vision will take effort , time and billions of dollars , officials acknowledge .\nFor example , the U.S. Cyber Command , the military \u2019 s primary operational unit , needs a \u201c range \u201d on which its troops could train , the way Marine riflemen practice their marksmanship . It needs \u201c aggressors , \u201d against whom to rehearse \u2014 the way Air Force pilots duel with other fighters playing the role of the bad guys .

Gen. James McLaughlin . It \u2019 s building a \u201c Cyber Mission Force \u201d that will include 133 teams made up of about 6,200 troops and Defense Department civilians , which it wants ready for action by fiscal 2018 .
