She shared her perspective recently with CNN iReport .\nThe economic collapse of 2008 left a lot of people `` stuck , '' she says .\nShe was `` stuck '' trying to sell her house , then felt `` unstuck a bit '' when Obama was first elected `` because we hoped he could change things . '' But things did n't change enough . `` We felt unstuck again this election , '' because the country seemed to send a resounding message about the kind of economic action it wants , including raising taxes on the wealthiest , she said .\n`` But now we feel stuck again '' because there 's no sign of a compromise . `` It means we freeze , we do n't buy as much , we save , we wait . ''\nCleave 's family is Buddhist , `` so we meditate on living with the feeling of uncertainty , '' she says . `` It 's part of life . But I think many people are in waiting and saving mode because they feel confused about how this will all play out . ''\nLela Ladd is one of them . Her family in McCook , Nebraska , is `` living frugally , anticipating future tax increases , '' she says .\n`` My husband and I are not exchanging Christmas gifts . In the past , we spent about $ 500 on each other . ''\nThe couple has three children and eight grandchildren -- each of whom will receive only one gift each from them this year\nThat frugality was already spurred by the hard times of the last several years , but the `` cliff '' is adding to that stress .\n`` It is hard not to be angry at our elected officials , '' says Ladd , 57 , a self-employed insurance agent . `` They have forgotten why we elected them : to watch out for our country . They really do n't know what it is like to walk in our shoes . You have to be rich to be elected to anything anymore , so the working class is no longer represented . ''\nSurveys show most Americans want compromise on Capitol Hill . A Gallup Poll found 62 % want Democrats and Republicans to reach a deal .\nBut many doubt it will happen . A Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll found 49 % of Americans do not expect an agreement by the end of the year , while 40 % do .\nThe frustration and fear could slice holiday sales , as people try to hold on to some cash , the National Retail Federation warns\nIt 's too soon to know whether the cliff fears are having a Grinch-like impact , and sales so far have hit new highs . But the federation is concerned about the weeks ahead .\n`` Before Thanksgiving , the threat of the fiscal cliff seemed remote to most Americans , '' says David French , the NRF 's top lobbyist , who is pushing both parties for action on the issue . `` Now , more and more people are focused on it , and the threat is becoming more real ... It 's uncomfortable for retailers . ''\nGovernment-style accounting would put a business 'in jail , ' owner says\nOwners of two small businesses in New Jersey told CNN they 're nervous and frustrated .\nAny business that followed the same `` method of accounting as our government '' would `` be in jail , '' complains Bob Bellagamba , CEO of Concorde Worldwide , a limousine company .\nHe wants a decision on the fiscal cliff `` so I know how to run my business . '' Depending on the outcome , he may have to lay off some employees , he said .\nCharles Altiero , owner of Freehold Jewelers , said tax increases might help him in one way . `` More people are going to have to sell their gold to pay their taxes . ''\nBut it would hurt his customers ' buying power . So , he said , he 's open to the idea of paying more taxes to help avoid going off the `` cliff . ''\nReliable Refuse Removal in Opal , Wyoming , has dropped an annual tradition .\n`` We normally present our biggest customers with appreciation gifts . This year everyone gets a card , '' said Mary Hall , who owns the business with her husband .\nThat 's due to the state of the economy in general , including the fiscal cliff , she said .\nHall , a mother of five , is also the small town 's mayor .\n`` I can see it affecting the programs we participate in with regard to funding for capital improvements , '' she said . No programs have been cut yet due to the fiscal cliff , but `` as the federal government starts cutting and limiting spending , the states tend to tighten their belts as well , '' she said .\nTax increases would make it 'not worth ' re-entering work force\nThe belt-tightening many Americans have been doing for years prompted Richard Huffman , a 63-year-old retired cop and CNN iReporter in Saint Joseph , Michigan , to consider re-entering the work force . He has six daughters and 14 grandchildren .\nNow , he 's changing his mind . `` I will not go back into the work force if taxes are to go up on the middle class , '' he says . So much of the money he would make would go to taxes that it would n't be worth working . `` These tax increases would take away from our income drastically . ''\nIt 's not just members of the middle class who are nervous about what lies ahead .\nBrian Chandler , a 34-year-old in Marietta , Georgia , says he 's among those Americans with incomes over $ 250,000 whose taxes would go up under Obama 's plan .\n`` I am technically considered 'rich , ' '' says Chandler . `` I did this through hard work , long hours , taking on work that clearly was n't my responsibility , networking , etc . Now it sort of feels like I 'm being penalized for that , in higher taxes , because of others ' lack of financial responsibility . ''\n`` I am concerned about the reduction of take-home income . I am also concerned taxing those above $ 250,000 a year may counter innovation and prevent some from working as hard as they do to earn that amount of money . ''\nHe and his wife have a son , and their daughter is due this month . They need more space . But he 's no longer looking for a bigger home . `` I 'm watching how it will all play out . ''\nWhile polls show it to be a minority , there is a contingent of Americans who want the country to go off the fiscal cliff .\n`` It will help because it will finally reduce the deficit with substance -- not just words , '' says Valerie Stayskal of Addison , Illinois . It will be painful for several years , but best in the long term , the mother of three and soon-to-be grandmother of twins argues .\n`` I want my kids and their kids to have a good life in a country that is stable and flourishing . I want them to have opportunity . If we do n't dig deep into the deficit , they are made to be burdened with this debt . ''\nPatrick Drake , of Norcross , Georgia , offers another upside .

''\nBut some others say they 're sick of all the talk -- which , they believe , will ultimately prove to be another example of the government scaring the public about something drastic that does not end up happening .\n`` This is government hype to the umpteenth degree , '' AnnMarie Blodgett wrote in our Facebook discussion . `` Everything gets a name these days .
