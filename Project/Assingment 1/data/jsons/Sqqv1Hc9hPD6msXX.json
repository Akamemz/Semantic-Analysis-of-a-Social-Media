No single occurrence , apart from the preposterously unlikely event of Barack Obama endorsing Trump , seemed to have a ton of power on its own . Non-silly scenarios included the release of new and questionable Clinton e-mails , a month of passable behavior from Trump , and a serious health setback for Clinton .\nWhat the column failed to consider , however , was the power of a few of these incidents occurring at the same time . We \u2019 ve now seen new unfavorable e-mail stories ( this was inevitable ) , two weeks of moderately controlled behavior from Trump ( the previous record had been about two days ) , and a genuine health issue for Clinton ( a near-collapse during a 9/11 ceremony ) . We also saw a small but foolish gaffe from the Democratic nominee on Friday night , when she dismissed fully half of Trump \u2019 s supporters as part of a \u201c basket of deplorables , \u201d which she defined as \u201c the racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic , you name it. \u201d At a time when Trump should have been further on the defensive , contending with almost comically devastating revelations about his approach to charity ( more on that in a bit ) , he is instead pulling even with his rival .\nRumors of Clinton \u2019 s failing health\u2014which had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestrated\u2014have become legitimate concerns .\nThere \u2019 s no use in discussing Clinton \u2019 s e-mails here , at least for now .
