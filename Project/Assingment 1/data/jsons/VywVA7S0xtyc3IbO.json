    "content_original": "Shaun Donovan will stay in his job as head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for a second term under President Barack Obama, an official said Wednesday.\n\nMr. Donovan, a former New York City housing commissioner, led HUD during the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression. His return to the post was largely expected after Mr. Obama tasked him late last year with leading the federal government's response to rebuilding coastal areas damaged by Superstorm Sandy.\n\nA spokesman said Mr. Donovan was \"honored\" that the president had asked him to stay on as HUD secretary. \"He looks forward to continuing his work with the president,\" said Alexander Wohl, the HUD spokesman.\n\nMr. Donovan played an important role shepherding a $25 billion settlement reached a year ago between 49 state attorneys general, five large U.S. banks and the Obama administration over foreclosure abuses. The administration has faced criticism for what many have called an ineffective response to the housing bust. Recent programs to boost refinancing for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth have had more success. The housing crisis has elevated the HUD secretary's role. One of Mr. Donovan's top challenges has been managing the Federal Housing Administration, which is at risk of requiring taxpayer funding for the first time in its 79-year history. The agency insures mortgages with low down payments and has played a crucial role providing credit during the housing downturn. Rising losses on loans it backed as the housing boom turned to bust are threatening to wipe out thin reserves. The administration also has yet to say what it will do with mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Officials have completed a thorough review of how to structure a new federal guarantee for certain mortgages but haven't detailed its preferred plan publicly.
