    "content": "The growing hostility between liberals and conservatives in the United States is a known problem to many . However , what to do about it is much less clear . Various groups , such as the Asteroids Club and the Village Square , have developed their own techniques for promoting civility between the opposing parties . What my collaborators Matt Motyl , Brian Nosek , Jon Haidt , and I wanted to know was : which strategy is the most effective at reducing partisan hostility ? The following describes the result of our attempt to throw the proverbial \u201c kitchen sink \u201d at this problem , testing the effectiveness of several techniques in one study . The five interventions we tested come from a collection of active civility groups , past social psychological research , and our own intuitions .\nLiberals and conservatives completed our study online , being exposed to one ( or none ) of our five interventions before completing measures of political attitudes and hostility . The interventions consisted of :\nSelf Affirmation- Past social psychological work has demonstrated that being reassured of one \u2019 s valued traits leads to less defensive and biased processing of opposing viewpoints . Participants in this condition spent a few minutes writing about a valued personal characteristic and a time that they embodied that trait .\nLearning Political Membership Last- People readily form impressions of others , and can be motivated to maintain their opinions in order to remain consistent in their evaluations . This intervention attempted to leverage this motivation by having participants read about a very positive group of individuals , only to later learn that they had volunteered for the opposing political party .\nObserving Civility- People often learn by observing the behaviors of others . For this intervention , participants watched a video describing the relationship between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Tip O \u2019 Neill . The video described the two as having a very friendly and respectful relationship , even when the two did not see eye to eye .\nSuperordinate Threat- Having a common threat can bring groups together . To create this common threat , we had participants read an article describing the threat of cyber warfare attacks on the United States . The article concluded by stating that bipartisan efforts had the potential to eliminate this threat .\nReducing Zero Sum Perceptions- Much of current political gridlock stems from a perception of legislation as a zero sum game ( any win for the other side is automatically a loss for my side ) . This final intervention sought to weaken this perception by describing the consequences of this mentality and the ways it is inhibiting progress . The article concluded by stating that shedding this mindset in favor of increased compromise could help both sides achieve their goals .\nAfter the intervention phase , participants completed a measure of partisan hostility , indicated their explicit liking of Republicans and Democrats , and completed an implicit measure of political attitudes ( the Implicit Association Test ) , which measured the participants \u2019 nonconscious attitudes toward the two groups . The goal of these interventions was to reduce hostility , not necessarily make participants like the other side more . As such , we were most interested in seeing whether each of the interventions reduced hostility relative to the group that received no intervention ( Control ) . The results are displayed below :\nEach dot represents the average hostility score for participants in a given condition ( with the red bars marking a 95 % confidence interval around that value ) . Higher hostility scores are indicative of greater hostility . These results show that each intervention produced the desired effect , that being lower hostility , but the degree to which they were effective varied . Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions was the most effective intervention at reducing hostility , closely followed by Superordinate Threat ( although Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions was the only intervention to approach statistical significance , p = .052 ) . Of note , none of the interventions reduced implicit or explicit liking for one \u2019 s own party relative to the other party . In fact , most interventions increased partisan preferences relative to the control condition . This demonstrates that promoting civility need not reduce an individual \u2019 s liking for his or her own group .
