But more striking to observers than the composition of the president \u2019 s Cabinet is its incomplete status nearly four months into his second term .\nThe White House on Thursday said it was Senate Republicans who were to blame for \u201c historic obstructionism \u201d against the president \u2019 s nominees .\n\u201c We call on Republicans in the Senate to stop gumming up the works when it comes to the confirmation process of nominees who are enormously qualified for the jobs that the president has asked them to fill and to get about the business of confirming them , \u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said .\nAs of this weekend , seven of Mr. Obama \u2019 s 23 Cabinet-level posts had yet to be filled with a confirmed nominee ( the president announced three of the nominations just more than a week ago ) . A check of presidential Cabinets going back to the administration of Woodrow Wilson in 1917 shows no other second-term president in the past century has had such difficulty putting together a complete leadership team .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really surprising how slow it \u2019 s been , how long it \u2019 s taken , \u201d said David Lewis , a political science professor at Vanderbilt University . \u201c This reflects a change in appointment politics in general . We \u2019 re fighting over things that we used to not fight over , and nominations are one of these things . \u201d\nSome past presidential nominations have led to drawn-out battles in the Senate ; for example , President George H.W . Bush \u2019 s appointment of John Tower as defense secretary in 1989 . But no other president in modern times has reached mid-May of the beginning of his second term with nearly one-third of his Cabinet unfinished .\nPresident George W. Bush \u2019 s second-term Cabinet was ready on Feb. 15 , 2005 , with the exception of U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman , who was confirmed in late May . The last Cabinet officer of President Bill Clinton \u2019 s second-term team was sworn in on May 1 , 1997 . President Ronald Reagan \u2019 s second Cabinet was full by April 29 , 1985 .\nThe Obama White House blames Senate Republicans for slowing down the nominations process . Republicans briefly filibustered John Brennan \u2019 s nomination to head the CIA in a dispute over drone policy , and on Thursday they boycotted a committee vote on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to head the EPA in a dispute with the administration over transparency issues .\nThe president \u2019 s second-term nominations got off to a bad start immediately when Mr. Obama signaled his intention late last year to appoint U.N . Ambassador Susan E. Rice as secretary of state . Republican lawmakers objected strenuously over her role in misleading the public about the causes of the deadly terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , and Mr. Obama ended up choosing Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts to head the State Department .\nThe White House said Republicans have bogged down the entire nominations process .\n\u201c Congressional Republicans have made no secret of the extraordinary lengths they will go to obstruct the confirmation process , \u201d said White House spokesman Eric Schultz . \u201c That unprecedented invasiveness , often about matters decades old or unrelated to the post , slows down the process from beginning to end . \u201d\nMr. Schultz pointed to the confirmation process for Treasury Secretary Jack Lew . Republican senators submitted 395 \u201c questions for the record \u201d to Mr. Lew ; Democrats submitted 49 such questions . The 444 questions for Mr. Lew were more than the combined queries for all Treasury secretary nominees dating back to Lloyd Bentsen in 1993 .\nAddressing the White House complaints , Don Stewart , who is a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said simply , \u201c Jack Lew was confirmed. \u201d The Senate approved Mr. Lew \u2019 s nomination on Feb. 27 , seven weeks after Mr. Obama nominated him .\nThe White House also cited as examples of GOP obstructionism the rough treatment of Chuck Hagel , who was eventually confirmed as defense secretary , and a lower-level nominee who waited 501 days before confirmation .\nMr. Stewart said that Democrats control the Senate and that Republicans are carrying out their responsibility to examine nominees thoroughly .\n\u201c Secretary Hagel was a controversial nominee but , again , was confirmed , \u201d Mr. Stewart said . \u201c And I don \u2019 t remember then-Sen. Obama agreeing to just wave nominees through without debate . In fact , he \u2019 s the first president in history to have joined a filibuster of a nominee .
