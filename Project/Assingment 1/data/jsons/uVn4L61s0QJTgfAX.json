It \u2019 s their job to find out who leaked a variety of national security secrets to a New York Times reporter , disclosures which led to a series of recent stories .\nThe leaks included highly classified information on a top-secret \u201c kill list , \u201d assembled by the president \u2019 s national security team , of targets for drone strikes .\nThe material also described in detail a U.S. cyberattack on Iranian infrastructure , as well as confirmation that American intelligence agencies had a mole inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .\nSome congressional Republicans , along with political pundits , have theorized that the White House authorized the leaks to aid Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election effort by getting his national security record back in the news .\nWhether that \u2019 s true remains unclear , but either way , the leaks could carry significant risk .\n\u201c In my opinion , an enormous amount of damage has been done to our national security , \u201d said Sen. Joe Lieberman , Connecticut independent , also speaking on Fox News .\nThe disclosure of cyberwarfare against Iran , Mr. Lieberman said , is especially troubling and could directly lead to a retaliatory strike .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a danger that it may legitimize an Iranian or terrorist counter cyberattack on us because we did it , \u201d he said .\nMany on Capitol Hill , including Mr. Lieberman , believe the administration should appoint independent prosecutors to look into the matter , rather than rely on investigators who report directly to Attorney General Eric H.
