    "content": "Two senior Senate Republicans are preparing for a rare intraparty showdown over who will lead the Budget Committee , testing how big a platform the party will give one of the loudest conservative voices in the new GOP-controlled Congress .\nThe race between Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Mike Enzi of Wyoming will have critical implications for the GOP \u2019 s vision on nationwide budget policy , determine whether Sessions \u2014 one of the fiercest immigration-reform critics \u2014 will have a prime committee perch and show just how much seniority matters in today \u2019 s Senate GOP , which is about to get a youthful infusion of at least 11 new members in January .\nWhile the two men have similarly conservative voting records , their styles couldn \u2019 t be more different : Sessions is a persistent partisan brawler , known for long floor speeches and sharp rhetoric , while the mild-mannered Enzi literally keeps his head down as he walks from his office to the Senate chamber , his mind buried in his tablet .\nThe future Budget chairman will have broad sway over the GOP \u2019 s policy visions , giving either Enzi a venue for his plan to produce a fiscal blueprint every two years or Sessions a platform for pushing a debt-slashing regimen that \u2019 s sometimes too aggressive even by Republican standards .\nGOP leaders insist they are hands-off in this pitched race between two friends . It \u2019 s the Budget Committee members \u2019 votes that will ultimately determine whether Sessions \u2014 who isn \u2019 t afraid to buck a Republican leadership that wants to prove it can govern responsibly next year \u2014 will broadcast his strident conservatism with a gavel in hand or from the rank-and-file sidelines . Enzi , meanwhile , is viewed as a more reliable GOP team player less likely to cause waves within the conference .\n\u201c Leadership has no role , \u201d insisted John Cornyn of Texas , the second-ranking Senate Republican .\nOnly Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) would tip his hand , choosing to back Sessions , while the rest of the committee is likely to hide behind a secret ballot . But members of the conservative movement are openly pushing for Sessions \u2019 elevation , arguing he \u2019 s proved himself an effective conduit for the party \u2019 s right during his four years as the committee \u2019 s top Republican .\nThis battle between two senators from the party \u2019 s conservative wing is the Senate \u2019 s only contested committee race this year \u2014 and a rare test of whether seniority will be the end-all , be-all factor that could rocket Enzi to the powerful post . While many assumed that Sessions had proved his bona fides as ranking member of the committee and was all set for a promotion , Capitol Hill was blindsided by Enzi \u2019 s decision to exert his seniority over Sessions on the committee and challenge him for the post \u2014 seniority that was literally decided by a coin flip after the two men entered the Senate at the same time .\nThe race is forcing Republicans into a tough choice between two veteran senators who are their friends and colleagues \u2014 and few want to broadcast a vote that could alienate either Enzi or Sessions . The lone exception : Graham , who co-wrote the Senate \u2019 s immigration bill that Sessions vociferously opposed . And yet Sessions has his support .\n\u201c I told Jeff I would be with Jeff . But I didn \u2019 t know there was a seniority problem ; I think that will matter to a lot of people . But I didn \u2019 t even know that Enzi was senior , \u201d Graham said . \u201c I feel bad in the sense that I [ committed ] before I knew what I was getting into . \u201d\nThe rest of the panel is tight-lipped . \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked all eight current Republicans on the panel , aside from Enzi and Sessions , whom they would support , and all , except for Graham , declined to answer . ( Republicans are also likely to pick up one or two more seats on the committee next year , and those new members will also have a vote . )\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been asked three times today , \u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) said in a brief interview Tuesday . \u201c I said I \u2019 m not going to answer that question . \u201d\nThe mere prospect of Enzi seizing the gavel is , in turn , frustrating conservative outsiders who are backing Sessions .\n\u201c This illustrates the disconnect between establishment Republicans and the voters . Why bench your all-star for a walk-on ? \u201d asked Gaston Mooney , executive director of the Conservative Review and a former aide to ex-Sen. Jim DeMint .\nThe National Review formally threw its support behind Sessions in an editorial last week , calling the Alabama senator \u201c one of the best advocates Republicans and conservatives have had on Capitol Hill for years . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Weekly Standard editor William Kristol said in an email that although his publication doesn \u2019 t endorse candidates , \u201c I will say I think highly of Sessions , and think he \u2019 s done a very good job at the Budget Committee . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s yet to be seen if those outside views will sway senators . Both Enzi and Sessions plan to talk with all committee Republicans in private meetings in the coming weeks to discuss their vision for the panel , sources familiar with the process said .\nCommittee member Kelly Ayotte ( R-N.H. ) said Enzi \u2019 s seniority on the committee matters less than who can best unite the GOP \u2019 s disparate factions come next spring when Senate Republicans try to write a budget .\n\u201c What I always want is someone who is going to listen to the views of all members , be respectful to them , \u201d said Ayotte \u2014 who will be meeting individually with both senators \u2014 ruling out seniority as the \u201c decider \u201d for her .\nSome committee members are even holding out hope that Sessions and Enzi will reach some sort of agreement to avoid a divisive election between the Alabama firebrand and the low-key Wyomingite .\nBut don \u2019 t bet on it . An Enzi aide said the two are headed toward an election \u2014 and when asked if either candidate might drop out , Sessions said he had nothing to announce . The famously chatty Sessions declined to weigh in on his chances , and the delicate politics of the battle was accentuated by Enzi brushing off \u2588\u2588\u2588 four separate times in two days when asked to speak about the race .\n\u201c We remain great friends , and my respect for him is high , \u201d Sessions said Wednesday . \u201c I \u2019 m not reporting on hour-by-hour [ movements ] . \u201d\nWhile the conservative movement is pushing the narrative that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) and his leadership team put Enzi up to the challenge , Republican leaders and Enzi \u2019 s office deny that assertion . Sessions himself said of Enzi : \u201c I think Mike makes up his own mind . \u201d\nMany had speculated that Enzi might retire ahead of the last election cycle , but a primary challenge from Liz Cheney seemed to invigorate the genial senator \u2019 s political fire . After winning his seat back and with Republicans taking the majority for the first time since 2007 , it only made sense for Enzi to exert his seniority and pursue a high-profile chairmanship .\nWhen Republicans last controlled the Senate , Enzi chaired the Senate Health , Employment , Labor and Pensions Committee ; it would have set off a different internal party challenge , against Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , had he sought to once again lead the committee .\n\u201c I thought he would take HELP , \u201d Sessions said . \u201c But that didn \u2019 t develop , apparently . \u201d\nThis illustrates the disconnect between establishment Republicans and the voters . Why bench your all-star for a walk-on ?\nAn Enzi aide said the senator had long had his eyes on the Budget Committee , one of the most sought-after posts in Congress . But it is also the one on which Sessions spent the past four years in the minority toiling as the panel \u2019 s top Republican , battling Democrats and , occasionally , GOP leaders and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) .\nThough some conservatives previously framed the Enzi-Sessions race as a broader fight over immigration , that component is becoming more muted .\nMark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , dismissed the notion that the gavel fight was becoming a proxy war on immigration , adding : \u201c I don \u2019 t even really think Sessions and Enzi would necessarily be all that different . \u201d\n\u201c Is it the melody or the background music ? \u201d Krikorian asked of the immigration factor in the Enzi-Sessions fight . \u201c It sounds like it \u2019 s probably just background music . \u201d\nWith a challenge in the open , there \u2019 s also a possibility that someone else will enter the race .\nOne Republican source closely tracking the internal drama said a younger , fresher Budget Committee member could make the case that the committee needs some new energy \u2014 particularly now that the race is wide open .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t need to have seniority to challenge a chairman in this system , \u201d this Republican said . \u201c Maybe we \u2019 ll have some more candidates \u2026 it could be anybody . \u201d\nHowever , several GOP sources warned that many members of the Senate are cool to superseding seniority in any fashion .
