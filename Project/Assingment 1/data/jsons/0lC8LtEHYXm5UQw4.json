    "content": "Since the 2016 presidential campaign , Donald Trump \u2019 s aides and advisers have tried to convince him of the importance of tackling the national debt .\nSources close to the president say he has repeatedly shrugged it off , implying that he doesn \u2019 t have to worry about the money owed to America \u2019 s creditors\u2014currently about $ 21 trillion\u2014because he won \u2019 t be around to shoulder the blame when it becomes even more untenable .\nThe friction came to a head in early 2017 when senior officials offered Trump charts and graphics laying out the numbers and showing a \u201c hockey stick \u201d spike in the national debt in the not-too-distant future . In response , Trump noted that the data suggested the debt would reach a critical mass only after his possible second term in office .\n\u201c Yeah , but I won \u2019 t be here , \u201d the president bluntly said , according to a source who was in the room when Trump made this comment during discussions on the debt .\nThe episode illustrates the extent of the president \u2019 s ambivalence toward tackling an issue that has previously animated the Republican Party from the days of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of Barack Obama .\nBut for those who have worked with Trump , it was par for the course . Several people close to the president , both within and outside his administration , confirmed that the national debt has never bothered him in a truly meaningful way , despite his public lip service . \u201c I never once heard him talk about the debt , \u201d one former senior White House official attested .\nMarc Short , who until recently worked for Trump as his legislative affairs director , said he believed the president recognized \u201c the threat that debt poses \u201d and he pointed to Trump \u2019 s concern \u201c about rising interest rates \u201d as evidence of his concern for the matter .\n\u201c But there \u2019 s no doubt this administration and this Congress need to address spending because we have out-of-control entitlement programs , \u201d Short said , adding , \u201c it \u2019 s fair to say that ... the president would be skeptical of anyone who claims that they would know exactly when a [ debt ] crisis really comes home to roost . \u201d\nRecent reports have suggested that Trump is determined , at least rhetorically , to address the issue . Hogan Gidley , a spokesman for the president , noted that the president and his team have proposed policies to achieve some deficit reduction , \u201c including in his first budget that actually would \u2019 ve balanced in 10 years , a historic , common-sense rescissions proposal . \u201d\nBut Gidley also passed the buck to the legislative branch . \u201c While the president has and will continue to do everything in his power to rein in Washington \u2019 s out-of-control spending , \u201d he said , \u201c the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and it \u2019 s time for them to work with this president to reduce the debt . \u201d\nThose close to Trump say that one reason the issue of debt reduction has never been an animating one for him is because he is convinced that it can be solved through means other than tax hikes or sharp spending reductions .\nStephen Moore , a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation and an economic adviser to Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign , recalled making visual presentations to Trump in mid-2016 that showed him the severity of the debt problem . But Moore told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he personally assured candidate Trump that it could be dealt with by focusing on economic growth .\n\u201c That was why , when he was confronted with these nightmare scenarios on the debt , I think he rejected them , because if you grow the economy\u2026 you don \u2019 t have a debt problem , \u201d Moore continued . \u201c I know a few times when people would bring up the enormous debt , he would say , \u2018 We \u2019 re gon na grow our way out of it . \u2019 \u201d\nMoore has since championed this approach to tackling the debt as a key part of \u201c Trumponomics , \u201d and has co-authored a book supporting it .\nAs Moore recalled , a belief that robust economic growth would solve all problems was the way Trump\u2014starting in 2016\u2014justified the cost of his ambitious proposals to slash taxes , pursue big infrastructure projects , and simply avoid massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare .
