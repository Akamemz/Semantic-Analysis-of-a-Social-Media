    "content": "Last October , shortly before the election , I came across a startling photo from Oakland , California , circa 1969 . Two men stood side by side : a black guy in a beret and leather jacket and a white guy in a denim vest emblazoned with the Confederate flag . The white guy was part of the Young Patriots , a group made up of poor white Southerners . The black guy was a Black Panther .\nThe two organizations , along with a Puerto Rican group called the Young Lords , had formed what they called the Rainbow Coalition\u2014a name Jesse Jackson would revive and popularize 15 years later . They had teamed up to fight for low-income issues like fair wages and access to health care even though , when the Panthers first approached them , some of the Young Patriots were enamored with racist ideas and symbols . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t easy to build an alliance , \u201d former Black Panther Bobby Lee once recalled . \u201c I had to run with those cats , break bread with them , hang out at the pool hall . I had to lay down on their couch , in their neighborhood . Then I had to invite them into mine . \u201d\n\u201c The powers that be have manipulated us into feeling like we are far more divided than we are . \u201d\nAfter Donald Trump was elected , that photo kept returning to my mind . Amid all the banter about how to reach white working-class voters who defected to Trump\u2014or , conversely , about why progressives should leave those \u201c deplorables \u201d behind and focus on voters of color\u2014I \u2019 ve found myself vacillating between these two points of view . I don \u2019 t believe in writing people off , and like many journalists I actually enjoy engaging with belief systems different from my own . But engagement only works when people can share a set of facts , or at least agree that facts exist . As we withdraw further into our political , geographical , and informational silos , any quest for common ground feels futile . So why even make the effort ?\nAnd yet . Something about that conclusion bothered me , so I asked Joan Blades , the co-founder of MoveOn.org , to lunch . In 2010 , Blades teamed up with former Republican operative Amanda Kathryn Roman to form Living Room Conversations , an organization that fosters \u201c transpartisan \u201d connection through intimate in-person discussions . Anyone can download their materials for free . In short , two co-hosts with differing political views each invite two friends to join them in a structured chat about a topic such as immigration or \u201c fake news. \u201d ( A sister project , Mismatch , pairs students at geographically and socioeconomically disparate schools for LRC-style video conferences . )\nBlades got to know right-wingers such as Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler , whom she now calls a friend . \u201c I \u2019 m deeply concerned that as we live in increasingly separate narratives , our capacity to have a democracy is diminished , \u201d she told me . \u201c The powers that be have manipulated us into feeling like we are far more divided than we are . \u201d\nListen to our Bite podcast episode about one of these conversation groups :\nShe \u2019 s not the only one trying to fix this . A slew of related initiatives have sprung up\u2014particularly since the election . Some , such as AllSides , CivilPolitics.org , Hi From the Other Side , Mismatch , Unbubble , and the Village Square , have a nonpartisan mission : encouraging politically dissimilar Americans to interact respectfully . Others , like Knock Every Door , support progressive candidates by bringing in volunteers to pursue open-ended talks with nonvoters and Obama voters who flipped to Trump .\nIn a Pew Research Center poll , 55 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of Republicans said the other party made them feel \u201c afraid . \u201d\nThey have their work cut out for them . In a recent study , researchers at the University of Colorado-Boulder found that subjects who engage in group conversations with politically like-minded people tend to emerge with a more extreme attitude . What \u2019 s more , many participants were oblivious to this effect , misremembering how they \u2019 d felt about an issue before entering the echo chamber . Last year , for the first time since it started asking back in 1992 , the Pew Research Center found that majorities from both parties held highly unfavorable views of their counterparts\u201455 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of Republicans said the other party made them feel \u201c afraid . \u201d\nTo assuage these fears , Living Room Conversations asks its participants to follow ground rules about respect and listening . Only after talking about their values and hopes for the country do they delve into thornier issues such as race or homelessness , using a few guiding questions . Afterward , people are invited to reflect on their experiences . Nearly all the participants who submitted feedback forms over the past three years said they had left the conversations feeling closer to those on the other side , learned something new or valuable , and found some common ground . \u201c My first Living Room Conversation , half the table cried , \u201d says Megan Range , a right-of-center Bay Area resident who has since participated twice more .\nBecause participants don \u2019 t register with the website , Blades can \u2019 t offer hard numbers , but she figures the hundreds of feedback forms she \u2019 s received represent a fraction of the total . One Texas Episcopal church holds conversations monthly , as does the city of Saratoga , California . And there \u2019 s been a surge of interest from community leaders and funders since the November 2016 election , resulting in partnerships with at least a dozen like-minded groups . \u201c The practice is proven and the time is right , \u201d Blades says . It \u2019 s not a quick fix , though . \u201c People are almost never transformed in a single conversation , \u201d she cautions , \u201c but their feelings about each other are . And that \u2019 s the opening for all sorts of deep transformation . \u201d\n\u201c Whatever empathy and curiosity progressives have felt toward conservatives , I worry that Trump has vaporized it . \u201d\nTransformation might mean coalition-building\u2014as liberals and conservatives have done on criminal justice reform\u2014or simply toning down the most hurtful rhetoric . Blades cites her relationship with LRC team member Jacob Z. Hess , a Mormon conservative living in rural Utah . Hess , who has a Ph.D. in psychology and has co-authored a book on right-left conversations , says talking to Blades has moderated his views . \u201c I have more uncertainty and curiosity , \u201d he says . \u201c I care about climate change because Joan does\u2014because I care about Joan. \u201d But Hess , who was never a Trump supporter , also worries that talking has gotten harder since the election . \u201c Whatever empathy and curiosity progressives have felt toward conservatives , I worry that Trump has vaporized it , \u201d he told me .\nOne obstacle , according to AllSides founder John Gable , a former Netscape product manager who in earlier days worked for politicians such as Mitch McConnell and George H.W . Bush , is that when one side says \u201c dialogue , \u201d the other side hears \u201c lecture. \u201d \u201c People on the right are scared to have these conversations , \u201d Gable says , \u201c because if you support immigration but you want some limits , people are going to call you a racist . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s precisely why the left needs to keep reaching out , says Kalia Lydgate , the national coordinator for Van Jones \u2019 # LoveArmy , which promotes activism through teach-ins and revival-style events . Some Trump supporters are clearly unapologetic white supremacists , but if you assume they all are , she says , you end up \u201c pushing those people toward the very dangerous subset of people who voted for Trump . \u201d\nWith that in mind , I attended a presentation called \u201c Reaching Out to Trump Voters , \u201d sponsored by the Berkeley , California , chapter of Indivisible . The speakers , cognitive linguist George Lakoff and sociologist Arlie Hochschild ( who has written about Trump supporters for \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) , had essentially the same advice : Don \u2019 t argue policy . Political thought springs from moral constructs embedded deep in our neural circuitry , and from governing metaphors\u2014what Hochschild calls \u201c the deep story \u201d \u2014that explain how the world feels . \u201c Telling people the facts over and over and over , that \u2019 s not going to do anything , \u201d Lakoff said . \u201c What will work is talking at the level of the heart . \u201d\nTrying to persuade a political foe using your own moral framework is a losing game . \u201c You have to empathize with them . \u201d\nThe heart .

Perry was put off by the anti-Trump rhetoric on Peskin \u2019 s Facebook page and by her barrage of questions\u2014every message felt like a homework assignment .
