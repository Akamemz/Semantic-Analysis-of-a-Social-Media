And for a dedicated few , it \u2019 s given rise to a new kind of challenge : to run ever-longer distances in ever-smaller spaces . For some , at-home marathons are a way to raise money for charity , or offer inspiration . For others , they \u2019 re a way to stay centered in the midst of a crisis that can seem overwhelming .\nBut for Ms. Thungo , that doesn \u2019 t mean no running . It just means running around her postage-stamp backyard , ducking under her washing line on every loop .\nAnd then the world around her started to shrink . On March 23 , as cases of the novel coronavirus ticked upward , the country announced a 21-day lockdown : no leaving home except for food or medicine .\nThree weeks ago , Shahieda Thungo was at the peak of her training for the Comrades , the world \u2019 s largest ultramarathon , which is run in South Africa each June . She was taking on weekly marathons like they were casual jogs .\nIt was one of the most grueling marathons that Wojciech Machnik had completed \u2013 and that was saying something . Mr. Machnik has run marathons that zigzag up mountain peaks . He has finished 26.2 miles in 90 degree heat and 95 % humidity . One week last June , he ran six marathons in six Caribbean countries , just to see if he could .\nBut even Mr. Machnik had never run a marathon quite like this . On a quiet Sunday morning last month in Warsaw , Poland , he rounded his bed for the 5,626th time , and then plopped down on top of it .\n\u201c It was a crazy thing to do to commemorate a crazy moment in time , \u201d he says . \u201c So I thought , why not ? \u201d\nAround the world , government restrictions to fight the novel coronavirus have changed the way we exercise . For many , that \u2019 s meant brushing off dusty home gym equipment or streaming blocky feeds of trainers in their living rooms . But for a dedicated few , it \u2019 s given rise to a new kind of challenge : to run ever-longer distances in ever-smaller spaces .\nIn China in February , an ultramarathon runner named Pan Shancu set the tone when he ran 31 miles through his small apartment , slurping noodles and taking videos of his stocking feet . In March in the south of France , furloughed restaurant manager Elisha Nochomovitz ran the length of his 23-foot balcony \u2013 with its sweeping view of the Pyrenees Mountains \u2013 6,000 times to complete his own self-isolation marathon . And then , a week later , he did it again .\nCourtesy photos Rossyle Ayuro ( left ) , a Filipino hospital administrator in Doha , Qatar , runs a loop of her apartment marathon last month . An app ( center ) tracks Shahieda Thung running loops of her postage-stamp yard in Johannesburg , and Wojciech Machnik ( right ) completes a marathon around a bed in Warsaw , Poland .\n\u201c This is literally a way to keep moving through this crisis , \u201d says Rossyle Ayuro , a Filipino hospital administrator in Doha , Qatar , who recently ran a marathon from her kitchen , down her hallway , out the door , to the elevator and back \u2013 1,400 times .\nAt-home marathons come with their own set of challenges , namely extreme boredom . But their adherents also see unusual upsides : no race-day jitters , and smooth-as-butter logistics . For runners like these , then , lockdown restrictions are less a limitation than a kind of extreme dare .\n\u201c Isn \u2019 t that what life is about , finding different challenges and conquering them ? \u201d says Shahieda Thungo , a South African ultramarathoner who \u2019 s been running 10 kilometer loops around her postage-stamp backyard in Soweto , near Johannesburg , ducking under her washing line on every loop . \u201c We run marathons , we run ultras , but maybe it \u2019 s only by running in tiny circles that we can really test our minds and find our breaking point . \u201d\nThree weeks ago , Ms. Thungo was at the peak of her training for the Comrades , the world \u2019 s largest ultramarathon , which is run in South Africa each June .
