Black students made up just 18 percent of students in the public schools sampled by the New York Times in 2012 , but \u201c they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once \u201d and 39 percent of those expelled \u2014 examining federal data , the Times also noted that \u201c nationwide , more than 70 percent of students involved in arrests or referrals to court are black or Hispanic. \u201d Even black preschoolers were not exempt : They made up the same 18 percent of the student population , but constituted half of all suspensions .\nAs everyone from the Times to the ACLU has noted , the enactment of tough \u201c zero-tolerance \u201d policies in schools has led to the criminalization of what had previously been viewed as minor disciplinary issues . Zero-tolerance often mandates that students be suspended \u2014 even referred to law enforcement and arrested \u2014 for minor transgressions : Until a 2013 rule change , Los Angeles students routinely received automatic suspensions for refusing to take off their hats ( this fell under a category of violation called \u201c willful defiance \u201d ) , while a Florida district , the sixth largest in the country , set a state record for student arrests in a jurisdiction in 2011 , primarily on charges of possessing small amounts of marijuana and spraying graffiti . The ACLU has called this phenomenon the \u201c school-to-prison pipeline . \u201d\nNow , a new paper in SAGE takes a closer look at how race and class affect school districts \u2019 approaches to punishment , but also examines another important element of school discipline : Some disruptive kids , rather than being punished , are \u201c medicalized \u201d \u2014 that is , eventually given diagnoses , therapy , and/or medication as a result of behavioral problems .

Ramey , of Pennsylvania State University \u2019 s department of sociology and criminology , used data from over 60,000 schools in 6,000 districts to examine trends in how schools \u2019 racial and socioeconomic makeup impacted how they dealt with misbehaving students .\nIf you \u2019 re a black student or you \u2019 re poor , you \u2019 re far more likely to be punished than offered behavioral treatment when you misbehave .\nThere was a strong correlation between the percentage of black students in a school and the rates of punitive discipline , and an inverse relationship between the percentage of black students and the rate of behavioral treatment . \u201c Schools with more black students relative to other schools in the district had higher rates of suspension or expulsion and police referral or arrest \u201d than other in-district schools , the study notes , and also had substantially lower rates of enrollment in mental-health and special education programs .

Ramey notes how one study found that schools blame \u201c poor parenting , cultural deficiencies , and poor character \u201d for bad behavior among racial minority children , and see that behavior as permanent and leading almost inexorably to involvement with the criminal justice system .
