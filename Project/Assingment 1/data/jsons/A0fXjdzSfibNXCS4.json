''\nHe then employed a famous Mark Twain line , `` Rumors of my demise are maybe a little exaggerated at this point . ''\n`` Look , we understand that we are in divided government right now , '' the president said , noting that the House of Representatives is controlled by Republicans and there are 60 votes needed in the Senate for measures to be passed there . `` Despite that , I am actually confident there are a range of things we will be able to get done . I feel confident that the bipartisan work that has been done on immigration reform will result in a bill that passes the Senate , passes the House and gets on my desk . That has been a historic achievement and I 've been complementary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts .

I had a chance to talk to him yesterday . He seems like a terrific young man , and , you know , I told him I could n't be prouder of him .

''\nOn other key issues in Obama 's second term , such as taxes , deficit reduction , and the sequestration spending cuts , a lack of bipartisan agreement has impeded the president from achieving these goals . He laid blame for that at the feet of Republicans in Congress .\n`` You seem to suggest that somehow these folks over there have no responsibilities , and that my job is to get them to behave , '' Obama said . `` That 's their job . ''\nBut a drastic overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws that offers a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants has proven to be an exception for today 's divided Congress . The effort has received support from Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle in both chambers .\nObama has been wary of inserting himself into the policymaking process on immigration , perhaps an acknowledgement that his involvement could turn off Republicans who are helping guide the bill through Congress .\nEven though the president remarked that the Senate 's proposal is `` not the bill I would have written , '' he said it meets his general principles for reform ; namely a clear pathway to citizenship , heightened border security , and streamlining the legal immigration system .\nAnd he declined to weigh in on the details of the negotiations of a bipartisan group in the House , which has not yet released its own immigration bill .\n`` I have n't seen what members of the House are yet proposing . Maybe they think they could answer some of those questions differently , '' he said . `` I think we have to be open minded in seeing what they come up with . ''\nBut Obama did say that the House plan , which will reportedly be a more conservative product than the Senate 's , must still meet his general criteria . That includes a pathway to citizenship .\n`` If it does n't meet those criteria , I will not support such a bill , '' he said .\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced the news conference on Twitter with a reference to the president 's comedy routine at the White House Correspondents ' Association dinner Saturday .\n`` POTUS brought down the house on Sat night at # WHCD - but he did n't take questions .

Some detainees have been at GTMO for more than a decade . And some have engaged in the hunger strike .\n`` It is not a surprise to me that we have problems in Guantanamo , '' he said . `` When I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008 and when I was elected in 2008 I said we need to close Guantanamo and I continue to believe we have to close Guantanamo , '' Obama said . `` I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe . It is expensive , it is inefficient , it hurts us in terms of our international standing , it lessons cooperation with our allies on counter terrorism efforts , it is a recruitment tool for extremists . It needs to be closed . ''\nThe president recounted how there was a battle with congress about closing the prison for potential terror suspects , but that he is `` going to go back at this . ''\n`` I 've asked my team to review everything that is currently being done in Guantanamo , everything that we can do administratively and I am going re-engage with congress to try and make the case that this is not the in the best interest of the American people and it 's not sustainable . ''\nObama acknowledged that it 's a `` hard case to make because for a lot of Americans the notion is out of sight , out of mind . ''\nHe added that he does n't `` want these individuals to die '' and `` the pentagon is trying to manage the situation the best they can but I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this ? Why are we doing this ? ''\nHis answer was to look at the amount of terrorists that have been successfully prosecuted by the American judicial system including the Times Square bomber noting `` justice has been served . ''\n`` We can handle this , '' the president said , referring to successfully prosecuting terrorists .\n`` This is a lingering problem that is not going to get better . It 's going to get worse . It 's going to fester . ''",
