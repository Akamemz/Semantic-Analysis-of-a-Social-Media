Brennan had the misfortune of being the one on the other side of the table when they did .\nIt seemed clear by the end of the session that Brennan had the support to be confirmed , but it was equally clear that senators are so angry with the Obama administration over questions of access to information about drone policies , Benghazi and other topics that the CIA nominee may have to wait for some of the questions to be sorted before being confirmed by the full Senate .\nFor hours , Brennan was battered by senators with long-standing grievances with the CIA or the Obama administration , even though many of the complaints had little or nothing to do with him .\nBrennan tried to head off some of the complaints by saying in his opening statement that he \u2019 d learned there was a \u201c trust deficit \u201d between the CIA and the Senate . He called that \u201c wholly unacceptable . \u201d\n\u201c I like to think that my candor and bluntness will reassure you that you will get straight answers from me , maybe not always the ones you like but you will get answers and they will reflect my honest views , \u201d he said .\nSen. Barbara Mikulski ( D-Md . ) made clear that there was a lot of work to do after decades of directors she said misled her or obstructed her requests .\n\u201c With the exception of Mr. Panetta , I feel I \u2019 ve been jerked around by every CIA director , \u201d Mikulski said , a list that would include not just Bush-era directors like Porter Goss and George Tenet but also perhaps Obama appointee David Petraeus .\nIf White House officials thought President Barack Obama \u2019 s belated decision Wednesday to allow intelligence committees access to classified Justice Department legal memos that justified drone strikes against American terror suspects abroad would appease the committee , that was clearly a miscalculation .\nInstead , it seemed to have provoked them . Senators opened the session with a flurry of complaints . They challenged Brennan about why senators \u2019 staff couldn \u2019 t look at the documents .\n\u201c Our staff was banned from seeing it \u2026 this is upsetting to a number of members , \u201d an irritated Chairman Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) declared .\nAnd the committee insisted that the two opinions they were shown were not enough : Eight additional opinions were demanded .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to see any and all of those legal opinions \u2026 before the vote , \u201d Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) said .\nRepublican senators said they were intent on using Brennan \u2019 s nomination to demand documents and emails about the administration \u2019 s handling of the attack on the Benghazi , Libya , Consulate last September that killed four Americans , including the ambassador .\n\u201c It is absolutely essential that the documents this committee has requested be supplied before the confirmation move forward , \u201d said Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina . Burr quickly added though that he hoped Brennan wouldn \u2019 t take it personally . \u201c I \u2019 m not saying you were part of it , \u201d the senator said .\nBrennan said the decisions on OLC memos and Benghazi documents weren \u2019 t his to make , but he hinted to the senators that he \u2019 s always favored greater disclosure to the public and the Hill committees .\n\u201c I will certainly be an advocate for making sure this committee has the documents it needs in order to provide its oversight function , \u201d he declared . \u201c I have been an advocate of that position and I will continue to be . \u201d\nThe hearing began with protesters from the liberal group CodePink repeatedly interrupting until Feinstein suspended proceedings to have nearly all members of the public removed from the room .\nBrennan made clear he is pained by the criticism and the suggestion that the administration is cavalier in its handling of the armed drone program .\n\u201c The people who are standing here today I think they have a misunderstanding of what we do in government , the care taken , the agony we go through , \u201d Brennan said . \u201c People are reacting to a lot of falsehoods that are out there . \u201d\nHowever , Brennan had few answers for Wyden , who has led the charge in demanding information and raising concerns about the drone program \u2014 particularly when it targets Americans .\nWyden asked how much evidence the president needs to use lethal force against a U.S. citizen and whether an American should be asked to surrender before he or she is targeted .\nBrennan was respectful but suggested there \u2019 s little point in telling Al Qaeda leaders to surrender . \u201c An American who joins Al Qaeda will know full well that they have joined an organization at war with the United States \u2026 They can surrender at any time , \u201d he said .\nFor all the questions about safeguards , no one on the committee said they were opposed to the drone program \u2014 and some came to its defense .\nHowever , after the hearing Feinstein told journalists she was unaware of reports that in some instances U.S. officials assumed any male of fighting age killed in a strike was a combatant \u2014 a method that could undercount the number of civilian deaths .\nBrennan said he favored the U.S. making a public statement when it made a mistake in a drone strike , but he never explained how one could do that and keep such strikes officially classified .\nFeinstein said the administration \u2019 s insistence on secrecy was undermining its ability to defend the effort . \u201c I think that rationale Mr. Brennan has long gone \u2026 I think it \u2019 s very important that we share this data with people , \u201d she said .\nOne subject some senators seemed keen on was the idea of a court that could review whether Americans belonged on a so-called kill list .\n\u201c Having the executive be the prosecutor , the judge , the jury and executioner all in one is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country , \u201d Sen. Angus King ( I-Maine ) said . \u201c If you \u2019 re planning a strike over a period of days , weeks or months , there is an opportunity to go to someone outside the executive branch , a body like a [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] court in a top-secret way and make the case that this individual is an enemy combatant . \u201d\nBrennan called the suggestion \u201c certainly worthy of discussion \u201d and said the administration had \u201c wrestled with this , \u201d but he also suggested designating someone as an enemy and an ongoing threat isn \u2019 t much like what courts normally do .\nThe campaign is over , but attacking Obama for leaks is not\nThe sharpest questions about Brennan \u2019 s own conduct came on the issue of a flurry of leaks of national security secrets last year .\nBrennan found himself under fire for a briefing he conducted last May for TV commentators as a story was breaking about a foiled Al Qaeda-linked plot in Yemen to blow up airlines bound for the U.S. Press reports about a U.S. double agent inside the operation may have caused the operation to be shut down prematurely .\nAfter Brennan admitted that he \u2019 d told the commentators that the U.S. had \u201c inside control \u201d of the operation , Sen. Jim Risch ( R-Idaho ) had a Sherlock Holmes moment .\n\u201c It seems to me the leak the Justice Department is looking for is right here in front of us ? \u201d\n\u201c I disagree vehemently , \u201d Brennan shot back . \u201c In my discussion with those individuals that night , it already was out in the press , \u201d the White House counterterrorism adviser said , though it was unclear whether he meant the plot itself had been reported or the presence of an agent on the inside .\nBrennan also acknowledged that he \u2019 d been interviewed by criminal investigators probing that leak but said his lawyer was told he was just a witness \u2014 not a subject or target of the investigation , two labels that can signify greater legal trouble .\nBrennan insisted that \u201c inside control \u201d didn \u2019 t amount to a signal to the press that there was necessarily a double agent , but that there were other ways to be sure an operation wouldn \u2019 t do harm . ( At least one of the commentators on the call that day seemed to interpret it that way . )\n\u201c It means any number of things \u2026 It does not reveal any classified information , \u201d Brennan said during questioning later by Sen. Dan Coats ( R-Ind. ) . \u201c Unfortunately , there was a hemorrhaging of information and leaks \u2026 I \u2019 m very comfortable with what I did and what I said at that time , \u201d the nominee added .\n\u201c That inside control was interpreted as meaning we got somebody inside and as a result of that , the covert action operation had to be dissolved , \u201d Coats said .\nThat led Brennan to warn Coats that he was straying into a classified area , even as he decried the leak . \u201c I must caution that some elements of this event that remain classified and that we can not talk about in public , \u201d Brennan said .\nPart of the committee \u2019 s walk down memory lane Thursday involved questioning Brennan about what he knew , said and did \u2014 or failed to do \u2014 about harsh interrogation tactics like waterboarding employed during the Bush administration .

I was cc \u2019 d on some of those documents , but I had no oversight of it\u2026 . I did not try to stop it because it was something being done in a different part of the agency under authority of others . \u201d\nBrennan said he had private conversations with others at the agency about his opposition to some of the techniques , but he did not name any of the colleagues he shared those views with .\n\u201c We just have not seen anybody come forward who ever heard any objection from you , \u201d Chambliss said .\nBrennan acknowledged that after he left the CIA , he defended the program to a degree and said it produced useful intelligence that saved lives . However , he said after reading parts of a still-classified , 6,000-page investigation the Senate intelligence panel completed in December , that he may have been mistaken or deceived about the program \u2019 s utility .\n\u201c There clearly were a number of things I read in that report that were concerning and disturbing to me , \u201d Brennan said . \u201c It was rather damning in a lot of its language , \u201d he said .\nBrennan resisted Sen.
