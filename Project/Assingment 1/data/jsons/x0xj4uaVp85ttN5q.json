    "content": "The Obama administration is on the verge of possibly doubling the salary levels that would require employers to pay overtime in the most ambitious government intervention on wages in a decade . And it doesn \u2019 t need Congress \u2019 s permission .\nAs early as this week , the Labor Department could propose a rule that would raise the current overtime threshold \u2014 $ 23,660 \u2013 to as much as $ 52,000 , extending time and a half overtime pay to millions of American workers . The rule has already come under fire from business and Republican opponents who say it will kill jobs and force employers to cut hours for salaried employees .\n\u201c The minimum wage they can \u2019 t do , \u201d said Bill Samuel , director of legislative affairs for the AFL-CIO . \u201c This is probably the most significant step they can take to raise wages for millions of workers . \u201d\nCongressional Republicans are gearing up for a major battle against raising the overtime threshold . The House Education and the Workforce subcommittee will devote much of a scheduled June 10 hearing on federal wage and hour standards to the overtime rule , even if it isn \u2019 t yet released . Sen. Lamar Alexander , chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions committee , said the rule\u2014sight unseen\u2014 \u201c seems engineered to make it as unappealing as possible to be an employer creating jobs in this country . \u201d\nThe business lobby , which is currently battling in two court venues what it calls the National Labor Relations Board \u2019 s \u201c ambush elections rule \u201d streamlining union elections , is likely to devote at least as many resources to fight the overtime rule . Randel Johnson , senior vice president for labor at the Chamber of Commerce , warned Labor Secretary Tom Perez in a Feb. 11 letter that any changes to existing overtime rules \u201c threaten to upend years of settled law , create tremendous confusion , and have a significantly disruptive effect on millions of workplaces . \u201d\nBy law , any salaried worker who earns below a threshold set by the Labor Department must receive overtime . The current threshold of $ 23,660 lies below the poverty line for a family four . The proposed rule is expected to raise that to somewhere between $ 45,000 and $ 52,000\u2014closer to the median household income\u2014greatly expanding the pool of Americans who qualify for overtime pay .\nThe overtime threshold is not indexed to inflation and has been updated only once since 1975 . It covers 12 percent of salaried workers . Boosting the threshold to $ 50,440 would bring it back in line with the 1975 threshold , after inflation . By one estimate that would give somewhere between five to ten million workers a raise .\nSome workers above the salary threshold also qualify for overtime pay under current law . But the historic shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service economy has reduced their number because white collar workers\u2014defined quite expansively\u2014are exempt . The forthcoming overtime rule is expected to tighten up that definition .\nUnder the current rules , the white collar exemption excludes \u201c executive , administrative and professional \u201d employees from receiving overtime pay , which means , for example , that a secretary will sometimes be ineligible for overtime pay . Employers routinely avoid paying overtime to lower-wage workers such as store managers or fast food shift supervisors , and even to some non-supervisory workers by giving them discrete , only nominally supervisory responsibilities .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to believe that somebody making $ 30,000 is a supervisor , \u201d said Daniel Hamermesh , an economist at the University of Texas at Austin , who has done extensive research on overtime . \u201c At this point , I don \u2019 t think even our regulations are in line with the original intent of the law. \u201d Hamermesh said raising the threshold was \u201c an absolute no brainer . \u201d\nOne key concern about expanding overtime is that it could prompt employers to reduce the number of hours that individual employees work to avoid paying time-and-a-half . McDonald \u2019 s , reportedly , already uses its computer system to record the hours worked by individual fast-food workers , and sends alerts telling franchisees to send this or that worker home when he or she is about to exceed 40 hours . In many instances reducing employees \u2019 hours worked may endanger their eligibility for benefits .\nBusiness groups carry that reasoning further , saying the rule will reduce employment . Aloysius Hogan , a senior fellow at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute , said it will have a \u201c job killing effect. \u201d Hogan said businesses will be incentivized to lay off higher-paid executives and replace them with lower-paid workers . The National Retail Federation , a likely leader in the battle against expanded overtime , last month issued a study that came to a similar conclusion . On its release NRF senior vice president for Governor Relations David French said the rule would \u201c hollow out middle-management careers and middle-class opportunities for millions of workers . \u201d\nBut Hamermesh said that to whatever extent employers reduced hours to avoid overtime the result would be more job creation , not less , since someone else must hired to perform that work . Jared Bernstein , an economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during President Barack Obama \u2019 s first term , added that for many workers reduced hours would be a plus : \u201c Their salary is the same but they have more time with their families . \u201d\nThe Obama administration \u2019 s interest in updating overtime rules can be traced to November 2013 . | AP\nThe Obama administration \u2019 s interest in updating overtime rules can be traced to November 2013 , when Bernstein , by then a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , and Ross Eisenbrey , vice president of the Economic Policy Institute , presented a paper on the subject to the Labor Department .
