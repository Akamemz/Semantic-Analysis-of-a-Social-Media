    "content": "( CNN ) The Republican establishment is making the most of the chance it had long sought to finally say this to Donald Trump : You crossed the line .\nEver since announcing his presidential run last month , the brash , unfiltered billionaire businessman has created headaches for the party . Particularly , his comments equating some Mexican immigrants to rapists and criminals left GOP leaders struggling to appease those Trump had offended without alienating conservative voters attracted to his views on combating illegal immigration .\nBut on Saturday , Trump seemed to hand party bosses and the pack of 2016 Republican presidential candidates a golden chance to take him down at almost no political cost -- while making themselves look magnanimous . The spark for the latest political firestorm came when the New York real estate billionaire questioned on Saturday whether Arizona Sen. John McCain , a Vietnam War veteran who languished in a prisoner of war camp for more than five years , was a genuine `` war hero because he was captured . ''\n`` I like people that were n't captured , OK ? '' Trump said , drawing gasps and `` boos '' from a conservative crowd in Iowa .\nWhat transpired within minutes of those inflammatory comments was telling . The GOP pile-on was swift and outspoken . McCain might be a controversial figure with plenty of enemies in Washington but he 's universally regarded as a rare example of pure heroism .\nThe Republican National Committee , which stays neutral in the GOP primary and rarely weighs in on political debates , made the unusual move of publicly condemning Trump 's remarks .\n`` There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably , '' RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on Twitter .\nWhile the GOP was shy in responding to Trump 's tirade against Mexico , it became clear on Monday that the party 's hierachy was not going to be bitten by the Donald again .\n`` Right now what you are seeing is the party taking a dramatic shift this weekend -- taking Donald Trump head on , '' Mitt Romney 's former senior political advisor and CNN contributor Kevin Madden told Wolf Blitzer . `` This is their chance to really draw some stark contrasts about the direction of the party .
