    "content": "President Donald Trump has promised to unleash \u201c fire and fury \u201d on North Korea and to \u201c totally destroy \u201d the country if it continues to threaten the US or its allies . His administration even recently considered potentially launching a small , limited military strike \u2014 what his aides described as a \u201c bloody nose \u201d \u2014 if Pyongyang conducted another missile or nuclear test .\nBut a decorated former South Korean general said this week that North Korean soldiers would fight foreign invaders with nearly religious zeal in the name of their leader , Kim Jong Un , if under attack .\n\u201c I try to explain to the Americans \u2014 if we have to go into North Korea , it is not going to be like going into Iraq or Afghanistan . It \u2019 s not going to be like toppling [ ex-Iraqi President Saddam ] Hussein . This would be more like trying to get rid of Allah , \u201d retired Lt. Gen. In-Bum Chun told a London think tank audience Wednesday .\n\u201c I have had the opportunity to speak to North Korean soldiers who have defected to South Korea \u2014 and you can not imagine how indoctrinated they are , \u201d he continued . \u201c These are people who have defected , and yet there is still an innate belief in their system which is close to ridiculous . \u201d\nChun has firsthand knowledge of what he \u2019 s talking about . He spent nearly 40 years in the South Korean military , including a stint leading the country \u2019 s special forces , before retiring only about 18 months ago . That means he spent his entire professional life studying North Korea through the eyes as a military professional who knew he might one day have to fight it .\nAnd some of what he describes is pretty frightening . North Korean pilots would likely use their planes in kamikaze-style attacks , since the aircraft are too old to reliably fly well over long periods of time . That matters since the North Korean air force has around 1,000 planes . Plus , North Koreans receive 100 hours of training on how shoot a weapon a year starting at the age of 14 , underscoring how militarized the society is .\nBut the crux of Chun \u2019 s argument is just how loyal North Korean troops and citizens will remain to Kim , even during a foreign invasion . That \u2019 s because the country has a system in which North Koreans spy on other North Koreans . If anyone so much as utters a bad word about the regime , that person could go straight to North Korea \u2019 s gulags \u2014 which a report last year claimed are as bad as Nazi camps .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that a war with North Korea is still very unlikely . North and South Korea are currently engaged in diplomatic negotiations for the first time in more than two years . On January 4 , North Korea reopened a military crisis hotline with its southern neighbor after nearly two years of silence , a move that could lower the chances of an accidental war between the two longtime foes . And on Tuesday , Pyongyang agreed to send its athletes to the Olympics in South Korea next month .\nWar , in other words , may not be imminent . But it \u2019 s important to know exactly how bloody one would be .\nIt \u2019 s worth highlighting the simple reason Chun used religious language to describe why North Korean soldiers would fight so aggressively : They revere members of the Kim family , who have led the country for decades , as gods .\nThe first leader was Kim Jong Un \u2019 s grandfather , Kim Il Sung , who was in power from 1948 to 1994 . He is still known today as the \u201c Great Leader \u201d and the \u201c Eternal President , \u201d and monuments glorifying his reign are everywhere in the country .\nWhen Kim died at the age of 82 , the Korean Central News Agency , the country \u2019 s state-run news organization , published a glowing seven-page announcement that said \u201c he turned our country , where age-old backwardness and poverty had prevailed , into a powerful Socialist country , independent , self-supporting and self-reliant. \u201d He was , as the news agency concluded , the \u201c sun of the nation . \u201d\nNorth Korean propaganda highlights the racial purity of the country and also recalls how it endured under foreign occupation over decades .
