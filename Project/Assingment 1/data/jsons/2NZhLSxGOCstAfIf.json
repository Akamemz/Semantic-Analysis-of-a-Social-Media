That compares to a 50 percent to 42 percent advantage Mr. Obama enjoyed in March .\nWhile independent voters tilt for the president , 40 percent to 38 percent , his advantage with women declined from 16 points last month to 5 points in July . Mr. Obama \u2019 s favorability ratings also are underwater for the first time since December , with 46 percent holding a favorable opinion of him and 48 percent an unfavorable one .\nStill , voters are not exactly lining up enthusiastically behind Mr. Romney , who has a 39-42 favorable-unfavorable split .\n\u201c One of them is going to win the White House , but neither would get elected Prom King , \u201d said Peter A . Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .\nThe poll , conducted from July 10-16 , surveyed 1,673 registered voters and has a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points .\nPundits are now acknowledging that the electoral map this year could look vastly different from four years ago , when Mr. Obama expanded Democratic territory and was able to flip historically red states such as Virginia and North Carolina .\nRather , it could more closely mirror the 2004 election , when , like this year , an under-fire incumbent was fending off a challenger about whom the electorate was not terribly enthusiastic .
