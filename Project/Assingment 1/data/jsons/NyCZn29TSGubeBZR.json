It contains increases for veterans ' medical care backed by both sides and fully funds food aid for low-income pregnant women and their children . The National Institutes of Health is sure to fall short of the $ 31 billion budget it won when Democrats controlled Congress .\nThough the bill provides the billions in aid to Egypt , it also places conditions on the aid and leaves it up to the Obama administration to determine if Egypt qualifies .
