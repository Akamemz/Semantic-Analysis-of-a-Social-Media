Rice is couched in racism or sexism , and pressed President Obama for more answers on the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi , Libya , as partisan battle lines hardened Wednesday over the incident and its aftermath .\nSome Democrats have hinted that the intense criticism of Mrs. Rice has to do with her race and her gender , but Sen. Lindsey Graham dismissed that argument .\n\u201c The only color I \u2019 m worried about when it comes to Benghazi is red \u2014 blood red \u2014 the death of four Americans , \u201d the South Carolina Republican said on \u201c Fox and Friends. \u201d \u201c When you can \u2019 t answer the question , you attack the questioner . \u201d\nMrs. Rice , who has emerged as a prime focus of the Benghazi investigation on Capitol Hill , spoke out herself Wednesday for the first time on the topic since appearing on a string of Sunday talk shows immediately after the attack .\nOn those shows , saying she was speaking on the basis of the best intelligence at the time , she downplayed suggestions that the strike on the U.S. Consulate in Libya was a premeditated terrorist attack by elements linked to al Qaeda . She also tied the attack , which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans , to an anti-Islam video .\nRepublicans \u2019 full-blown leap into the fray indicates that questions about Mrs. Rice and her potential nomination as secretary of state will not dissipate soon . Mr. Graham and Sen.

I don \u2019 t think any senior official of any administration should go on national television and assure the American people that the deaths of four Americans can be explained by the following if they don \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re talking about . \u201d\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday outside the U.N. Security Council , Mrs. Rice did not blame race or sex for the furor .

Among those questions are why Mrs. Rice , who was not involved in Benghazi , was chosen to explain it to the public instead of someone with firsthand knowledge of the consulate or the administration \u2019 s response when it was under attack .\n\u201c The American people deserve answers to what actions you and members of your Administration took before , during , and after the Benghazi attack , \u201d Mr. Graham wrote . \u201c I am committed to finding out the truth and working to ensure a debacle like Benghazi does not happen again . \u201d\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the letter Wednesday , but the president defended Mrs. Rice at a news conference last week , inviting critics , such as Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham , to \u201c go after me . \u201d\nHe also revealed that it was the White House that sent Mrs. Rice to the talk shows and said she relayed the best available intelligence at the time . It was later revealed that the office of Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper deleted information about al Qaeda and terrorism from the talking points given to other administration officials shortly after the attack , deciding that the information was too tenuous to cite publicly .
