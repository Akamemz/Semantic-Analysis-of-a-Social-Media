Mark Warner of Virginia in this year \u2019 s midterms . Mike Hubbard , who chaired the Alabama Republican Party in 2010 , became speaker of the Alabama House .\nThe RSLC \u2019 s current president , Matt Walter , declined to comment on the details of the BakerHostetler report and described it as a \u201c stolen \u201d document . He said the RSLC has a \u201c very detailed and thorough enforcement process \u201d to ensure it operates on the right side of the law .\n\u201c That is an internal report that is now a couple administrations old at the RSLC and was designed to be an internal report , \u201d Walter said . \u201c It appears that a thorough review was done and , again , this is several administrations ago . All of the decision-makers cited in it are no longer employed by the RSLC . \u201d\nWalter said the group no longer has a relationship with Hubbard , who remains one of the most powerful Republicans in Alabama . \u201c We have not talked to Mike Hubbard in some time , \u201d he said .\nAccording to the BakerHostetler report , the questionable campaign finance scheme went something like this : Hubbard would raise Alabama money into the national RSLC account , including from the deep-pocketed Poarch Creek Indian Tribe . In return , the national group would put every dollar Hubbard raised back into Alabama , obscuring the original source of the money .\nRSLC raised some $ 1.1 million from Alabama between January 2009 and March 2011 , according to the report . IRS records show the group took in $ 550,000 from the Poarch Creek tribe during that period : $ 350,000 during the 2010 election campaign and an additional $ 200,000 in January 2011 .\nDuring the same time period , RSLC \u2019 s Alabama PAC directed some $ 1.4 million to the Alabama GOP and several other state groups , including multiple PACs controlled by Hubbard . It also sent $ 100,000 to a group , Citizens for a Better Alabama , that the report describes as \u201c the renamed \u2018 Citizens Against Legalized Lottery \u2019 ( \u2018 CALL \u2019 ) , one of the Christian groups through which Jack Abramoff funneled Choctaw Indian-money . \u201d\nThe RSLC board report , dated Sept. 14 , 2011 , and authored by BakerHostetler election attorney Mark Braden and two other lawyers , warned that the path of the Alabama money could trip over a state law that bans \u201c making or accepting a contribution by one person in the name of another. \u201d Violation of that law would be a misdemeanor .\n\u201c It is \u2026 common knowledge and wisdom in Alabama that taking a contribution directly from the tribe is political suicide for a Republican candidate or public official , \u201d the report stated . \u201c Here RSLC appears to have served as both a recipient of the funds in question and as a donor of the funds back to Alabama , thereby permitting Mike Hubbard to do indirectly that which he could not do directly . \u201d\nThe report continued : \u201c RSLC-AL [ the group \u2019 s Alabama PAC ] would mail contributions directly to Hubbard at his office , and he would personally deliver these contributions . It would appear , then , to an outside observer that Hubbard was raising money for RSLC that was either politically toxic or in excess of Alabama contribution limits , and then channeling that money through RSLC back to himself in order to get around the governing Alabama campaign finance laws . \u201d\nThe document , referred to casually as the \u201c Braden memo \u201d by several Republicans involved with RSLC , said that one senior RSLC official \u2014 the group \u2019 s former president , Scott Ward \u2014 confirmed the existence of a \u201c one-for-one deal , under which Hubbard would raise money for RSLC in return for which RSLC would contribute the same amount of money back into Alabama . \u201d\nWard denies that he offered any such confirmation and called the report a \u201c [ Chris ] Jankowski political document \u201d \u2014 referring to the strategist who took over as the RSLC \u2019 s president in 2011 \u2014 \u201c intended to smear Mike Hubbard and Tim Barnes . \u201d\n\u201c I deny the conclusions of the report and stand behind what we did in Alabama .
