    "content": "The controversial individual mandate that was upheld Thursday by the U.S. Supreme Court stems back more than 20 years , believed to have originated with a prominent conservative think tank .\nThe mandate , requiring every American to purchase health insurance , appeared in a 1989 published proposal by Stuart M. Butler of the conservative Heritage Foundation called `` Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans , '' which included a provision to `` mandate all households to obtain adequate insurance . ''\nThe Heritage Foundation `` substantially revised '' its proposal four years later , according to a 1994 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office . But the idea of an individual health insurance mandate later appeared in two bills introduced by Republican lawmakers in 1993 , according to the non-partisan research group ProCon.org . Among the supporters of the bills were senators Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , and Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , who today oppose the mandate under current law .\nIn 2006 , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , who was then governor of Massachusetts , signed off on a law requiring individuals of the state to purchase health insurance . American Bridge 21st Century , a Democratic opposition research group , on Wednesday released a 2006 video in which Romney says he is \u201c very pleased \u201d with the mandate .\n\u201c With regards to the individual mandate , the individual responsibility program that I proposed , I was very pleased that the compromise between the two houses includes the personal responsibility mandate . That is essential for bringing the health care costs down for everyone and getting everyone the health insurance they need , '' Romney says in the video .\nIn 2007 , a bi-partisan Senate bill authored by Senators Bob Bennett , R-Utah , and Ron Wyden , D-Oregon , contained a mandate . In 2009 , however , Republican senators declared such a provision \u201c unconstitutional . \u201d\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign , Obama expressed opposition to a mandate requiring all Americans to buy health care insurance . In a Feb. 28 , 2008 , interview on the Ellen DeGeneres show , Obama sought to distinguish himself from then-candidate Hillary Clinton by saying , `` Both of us want to provide health care to all Americans . There \u2019 s a slight difference , and her plan is a good one . But , she mandates that everybody buy health care .\n`` She \u2019 d have the government force every individual to buy insurance and I don \u2019 t have such a mandate because I don \u2019 t think the problem is that people don \u2019 t want health insurance , it \u2019 s that they can \u2019 t afford it , '' Obama said . `` So , I focus more on lowering costs . This is a modest difference . But , it \u2019 s one that she \u2019 s tried to elevate , arguing that because I don \u2019 t force people to buy health care that I \u2019 m not insuring everybody .
