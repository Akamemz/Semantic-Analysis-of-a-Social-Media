    "content": "I recently drove around the congressional district in which I grew up , Virginia \u2019 s 7th District , which encompasses the suburbs of Richmond . It \u2019 s the home of Dave Brat , the Tea Party-backed professor who stunned the political world by upsetting Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary that everyone assumed was a safe bet for the sitting House majority leader . Today , Brat is being challenged by Abigail Spanberger , a former C.I.A . operative and mother running in a district teeming with college-educated , suburban women who Democrats are counting on this year . The district hasn \u2019 t elected a Democrat since 1963 , but every Republican and Democratic professional in Richmond knows that anti-Trump energy has put the race in striking distance for Spanberger . National Republicans are now playing defense , with Paul Ryan \u2019 s super PAC coming in to attack her on television and Brat playing hide-and-seek when it comes to scheduling a debate . Even two years ago , that state of play in that district would have been unthinkable .\nThe precinct where I was raised is mostly white and upper middle-class . Millennial parents move there for the good schools , pretty tree-lined streets , and nice mall ( ahem , \u201c Fashion Park \u201d ) that includes both a Brooks Brothers and a humming P.F . Chang \u2019 s . People in Richmond refer to the area , the West End , like people in Los Angeles talk about Orange County , or people in Cincinnati talk about Indian Hill . It \u2019 s basically a wealthy , white suburb that \u2019 s been reliably Republican since the 60s . Over the years , it \u2019 s trended purple , handing more of its votes to centrist Democrats like Mark Warner and Tim Kaine . But never in my life have I witnessed what I saw driving around that pocket of Henrico County a few weeks ago : yard signs at every third or fourth house for Spanberger , a Democrat running for Congress in a district that should be as starched-shirt Republican as it gets .\nAnd that \u2019 s where I checked myself , because this kind of journalism-by-anecdote\u2014the genre where Tom Friedman talks to an Uber driver with purple hair and renders some kind of sweeping cultural thesis\u2014is supposed to be kind of unfashionable . Especially when it comes to political journalism . Since President Barack Obama \u2019 s data-driven re-election in 2012 , there \u2019 s been a rush among political experts to embrace science over art , math over texture . Snark merchants on Twitter who rarely leave their desks sometimes enjoy mocking the old David Broder style of reporting , in which a big-foot journalist travels to a bellwether state , listens to voters , and tries to convey a political mood .\nSo I asked a Republican strategist in Richmond , Will Ritter , a veteran of Mitt Romney \u2019 s campaign , what sort of public data might support the idea that Spanberger was surging . \u201c Other than yard signs and chatter I \u2019 ve got no evidence , \u201d Ritter told me . \u201c There \u2019 s no numerical backup to the VA-7 race being Dem-energized except farts and smiles . \u201d\nThe lack of polling in races like Brat \u2019 s is one factor leaving Beltway types uncertain about what \u2019 s really happening in the midterms .
