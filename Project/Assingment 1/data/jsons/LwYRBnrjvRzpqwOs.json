    "content": "Nearly 15 years ago , the unspeakable happened in AIDS-ravaged South Africa . The nation \u2019 s president , Thabo Mbeki , was apparently fooled by posts on Western Internet websites that disputed whether HIV caused AIDS , and he ordered that the country \u2019 s physicians stop administering antiretroviral drugs to citizens afflicted with HIV , which was almost 1 in 10 at the time . President Mbeki aggressively defended his actions , claiming that AIDS in Africa was primarily a heterosexual paradox . He insisted that the disease was `` a uniquely African catastrophe , '' and said that conventional medicine from the West was an `` absurd and illogical '' solution to the country \u2019 s health crisis .\nMbeki deferred to a group of dissident\u2014and thoroughly discredited\u2014academics and naysayers in the U.S. With AIDS predicted to decimate a full 25 % of South Africa 's population by the year 2010 , Mbeki pinned all South Africa \u2019 s hopes on containing the disease on the advice of a controversial molecular biologist , Peter Duesberg , who claimed HIV was relatively harmless and that AIDS was caused more by poverty-related conditions such as undernourishment than by unprotected sex . So , instead of administering the cocktail of HIV medications known to be effective , Mbeki had his health minister contrive alternative remedies for AIDS , including beetroot and garlic .\nThe results were devastating for South Africa . More than 330,000 people died prematurely from the disease between 2000 and 2005 due to Mbeki \u2019 s AIDS denialism , and at least 35,000 babies were born with HIV , infections that could have been prevented using conventional medicine , according to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health .\nWhile there is no direct institutional denialism of conventional medicine here in the U.S. , the denialist movement is active and spreading nonetheless . Vaccine denialism\u2014especially in states with lax public-health laws\u2014has already shown to have a negative effect on public health in some regional pockets , and it \u2019 s leaving those communities open to outbreaks of diseases that had been all but eradicated , including measles , polio , whooping cough ( pertussis ) , and even smallpox .\nIn 2013 , researchers confirmed that a 2010 whooping cough outbreak in California\u2014the worst in the U.S. in more than 50 years\u2014was spread primarily by the children of parents who received non-medical exemptions for school vaccinations from the state . The study showed that the outbreak was found exclusively in clusters where children were not vaccinated . There were more than 9,000 cases of the disease in California in 2010 and 10 deaths . In San Diego County , where there were about 5,000 immunization exemptions , there were 980 cases of whooping cough .\nMeanwhile , some states were slashing programs for children 's vaccinations . In 2011 , the year after the whooping cough outbreak in California , Florida Republican Gov . Rick Scott cut a state program that provided whooping couch vaccines for poor mothers of babies too young to get their first whooping cough vaccines . There has since been a whooping cough outbreak in Florida with a six-week-old boy dying from the disease .\nThese whooping cough outbreaks have been followed by a measles outbreak that began in Texas this year , which is now spreading throughout the U.S . Measles had also been declared eliminated , but in recent years it has appeared in areas with low-vaccination rates . The original Texas outbreak affected 21 children who attended the Eagle Mountain International Church in northern Texas , a congregation skeptical of vaccines . The outbreak began after an un-\u200bimmunized man visited Indonesia and then the church , which is part of the Kenneth Copeland ministries . None of the children affected had been vaccinated .\n`` This is a good example , unfortunately , of how birds of a feather flock together , '' Jason Terk , an infectious disease specialist recently told NPR . `` If you have individuals who are vaccine-hesitant or vaccine-hostile , they congregate together , and that creates its own unique situation where a population of individuals is susceptible to getting the very disease that they decided they do n't want to protect themselves from . ''\nOverall , measles has infected nearly\u200b 600 \u200bpeople \u200bin 18 localized breakouts across 21 states in the U.S. this year . And despite more than 90 % of the U.S. population being immunized against measles , this is the worst measles outbreak in decades , according to the Centers for Disease Control . Nearly three times the number of people have been infected through the end of August than were infected in all 2013 .\nSo far , there are no reported deaths from measles in the U.S. this year , but researchers say it \u2019 s all a numbers game . Between one and two of every 1,000 cases of measles are fatal , according to the CDC .\nOne of the scariest facets of vaccine denialism \u200bare those who claim they \u2019 re \u201c not anti-vaccine , but pro-safe vaccine. \u201d Thus , they validate themselves as responsible and immunize themselves ( pardon the pun ) from criticism once outbreaks of measles and whooping cough occur . Thus , those who choose to delay vaccinations or not stick by the prescribed schedule can deny culpability . But their apprehension and ambiguity \u2014 whether denialism or not \u2014 feeds the doubt that keeps other parents from immunizing their children . And any rhetoric against vaccinations can have a negative impact .\nTake the Taliban-occupied areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan , regions where children are being kept from critical vaccinations . This tragedy has nothing to do with denial , but instead anger with the U.S . Leaders of the radical Islamic sect have attacked healthcare workers , killing 61 of them and their escorts in the past two years , and have banned the dispersal of the polio vaccine after they discovered a fake vaccination campaign was used to hunt down Osama bin Laden through his family \u2019 s DNA several years ago .\nThe results of the Taliban \u2019 s quasi-institutional embargo on vaccinations have been devastating . Last week , Pakistan reported another 11 new cases of polio , bringing this year \u2019 s total to 138 , compared with 34 cases of the crippling disease from just a year earlier .\nOnce nearly extinct , polio \u2019 s comeback in the Middle East and northern Africa has elicited a declaration of a global health emergency from the World Health Organization , which has asked these and other countries to ensure their residents are vaccinated before they travel abroad .\nCan polio make a comeback in the US ? Researchers in Europe are saying that the disease can make a comeback there as regional conflicts are undermining a $ 10 billion immunization campaign . They \u2019 re also concerned about polio \u2019 s recent reemergence in war-torn Syria , and the possibility that \u200bunimmunized refugees who carry the virus may flee to European countries that have been polio-free for decades.\u200b\u200b\nEarlier this year , Penn State \u2019 s Department of Biochemistry warned that national and global events could combine into some reemergence of polio here , but only for communities that don \u2019 t immunize , like the\u200b 2005 breakout in a Minnesota Amish community . But for the general U.S. population , there \u2019 s little risk of polio flaring up , as is happening overseas .\nBut even as vaccination rates are high in the U.S. , the anti-vaccine movement is growing in some states , aided by permissive religious and personal exemptions allowed by state laws . Paul Offit , the noted pediatrician and vaccine advocate , notes that states like Idaho , Michigan , Oregon and Vermont have rates of un\u200bvaccinated kindergartners that are four times the national average .
