There is no agreement on what , if any , alternatives could pass both chambers and be signed by the President if the conference committee fails . Monday is a crucial day as lawmakers try and figure a way out of another mess , all as the clock ticks away .

There are significant splits , particularly given the Trump administration 's immigration enforcement posture , on how the Department of Homeland Security and its components , namely Immigrations Customs Enforcement do their work . An under-appreciated issue , at least in the broader `` border wall '' conversation , has been just how central detention beds for detained undocumented immigrants sits as an issue -- and an extremely divisive one at that -- for both parties .\nSo this is what happened : Current government funding levels allow for just north of 40,000 detention beds ( 40,520 , to be exact ) . The Trump administration has already surpassed the number , which it views as the floor , not the ceiling , and largely front-loaded the spending on beds ( and reprogramming of funds from other agencies ) to fund detention beds throughout this year .\nTo put a finer point on things : Democrats view detention beds as central to a Trump administration immigration policy that is harsh and needlessly aggressive .

Democrats proposed capping the number of beds at 16,500 .

As is always the case, Congress can move quite quickly when it wants to, but at this point there's zero agreement about a backstop or alternative plan between the two parties and chambers. Conference negotiators basically have until the end of Monday to figure something out, aides in both parties say.
