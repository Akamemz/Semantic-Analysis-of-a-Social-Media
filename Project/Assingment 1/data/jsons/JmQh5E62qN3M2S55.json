    "content": "A House panel voted Wednesday in favor of holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress , a move that inflamed partisan rancor on Capitol Hill and sets up the possibility of legal action against the attorney general himself .\nHolder has not yet been formally held in contempt of Congress . The full House would still need to approve the resolution in order for that to happen -- Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , afterward told Fox News that such a floor vote can still be avoided .\nBut the 23-17 party-line vote on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee marked a significant turn in lawmakers ' 16-month investigation into the botched anti-gunrunning operation Fast and Furious . With the vote , Republicans on the committee signaled they had exhausted all other means to extract sought-after documents from the Justice Department -- though Democrats had insisted there was still an opportunity to sort out the mess without a contempt vote .\n`` We and the American people need answers sooner , not later , '' said Issa , R-Calif. , chairman of the committee .\nIssa pressed ahead with the vote Wednesday despite an eleventh-hour move by President Obama to assert executive privilege over the Fast and Furious documents at the heart of the dispute .\nPreceding the vote late Wednesday afternoon was a caustic debate before the committee that spanned six hours , as Democrats accused Issa of prosecuting a `` political witch hunt '' and Republicans stepped up their criticism of Holder 's `` stonewalling '' over the Fast and Furious probe . Even for Washington , the tone at the hearing was decidedly bitter and accusatory .\nRep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , shouted while rattling off his complaints against the Justice Department .\nOn the other side , Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , ranking Democrat of the committee , offered an impassioned defense of the attorney general even as he and other Democrats acknowledged Fast and Furious was severely flawed .\n`` I do n't think he 's hiding a damn thing , '' Cummings said of Holder shortly before the contempt vote .\nDemocrats roundly voiced disappointment with the proceedings , describing them as politically motivated and avoidable . They pleaded with Issa to seriously consider Obama 's executive privilege claim -- the first Obama has asserted -- while some said Holder was being punished for withholding internal documents he should n't be turning over anyway .\nRepublicans praised Issa for pressing ahead , describing the vote as entirely unavoidable considering the department 's alleged refusal to cooperate . They frequently invoked the name of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry -- Fast and Furious-linked guns were found at the scene of Terry 's murder in 2010 . And Issa indicated he was waiting for a more detailed explanation from the White House , and a letter from Obama himself , before even considering changing course based on the executive privilege claim .\nIssa also accused the Justice Department of trying to compel the committee to close its investigation in exchange for documents it has n't yet seen . `` I ca n't accept that deal . No other committee chairman would , '' he said .\nBut Cummings fired back that Holder never made such a demand -- a Justice official also refuted Issa 's claim -- and said the attorney general had come to the committee in `` good faith '' to try and work out an agreement .\nCummings said the contempt vote has `` diminished '' the prestige of the panel . `` For the past year , you 've been holding the attorney general to an impossible standard , '' he said , addressing Issa . `` Mr. Chairman , it did not have to be this way . It really did n't . ''\nRep. Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y. , added that she was `` horrified '' by the panel 's looming vote , calling it a `` political witch hunt '' and accusing Republicans of `` overruling '' the president .\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was first informed of the president 's decision to assert executive privilege over the disputed Fast and Furious documents in a letter Wednesday morning , shortly before the contempt vote was scheduled .\nIssa said committee staff were evaluating the letter but described the move as too little , too late as he and other GOP lawmakers questioned the basis for the assertion .\n`` This untimely assertion by the Justice Department falls short of any reason to delay today 's proceedings , '' Issa said .\nThe committee , while voting down several Democratic amendments to the resolution , later approved a GOP amendment designating Obama 's executive privilege claim as inappropriate .\nThe move by Holder and Obama to lock down some requested documents only complicates the fight over the botched anti-gunrunning operation between the legislative and executive branches .\nAfter Holder made the request to Obama via letter on Tuesday , Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote to Issa , R-Calif. , on Wednesday informing him that the president has granted the request .\n`` We regret that we have arrived at this point , after the many steps we have taken to address the committee 's concerns and to accommodate the committee 's legitimate oversight interests regarding Operation Fast and Furious , '' Cole wrote . `` Although we are deeply disappointed that the committee appears intent on proceeding with a contempt vote , the department remains willing to work with the committee to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the outstanding issues . ''\nObama 's decision pertains to documents from February 2011 and afterward examining how Justice officials learned about the Fast and Furious probe .\nHolder , in his letter to Obama requesting he assert executive privilege , said those documents pertain to the `` deliberative process '' on how to respond to congressional and media inquiries .\nIn a statement released late Wednesday , Holder accused Issa of rejecting all efforts to `` reach a reasonable accommodation . ''\n`` Instead , he has chosen to use his authority to take an extraordinary , unprecedented and entirely unnecessary action , intended to provoke an avoidable conflict between Congress and the Executive Branch . This divisive action does not help us fix the problems that led to this operation or previous ones and it does nothing to make any of our law enforcement agents safer . It 's an election-year tactic intended to distract attention -- and , as a result -- has deflected critical resources from fulfilling what remains my top priority at the Department of Justice : Protecting the American people , '' he said . Holder said claims that his department was unresponsive are `` untrue . ''\nWhite House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer also called the vote '' a politically motivated , taxpayer-funded election-year fishing expedition .

''\nWednesday 's developments follow a flurry of activity Tuesday , as Holder tried to negotiate a way to avert the contempt proceedings .
