    "content": "About a year and a half ago , I wrote a piece here about a phenomenon I called The Great Whitebread Hope , which is an ongoing Republican establishment fantasy of electing an upper-Midwestern `` reformer '' in the LaFollete tradition who can bring together all the disparate factions of the party and offer up an image of respectable , mature , pragmatic leadership ( and incidentally pick up some badly needed electoral votes from somewhere ) .\nIn 2008 , it was former Gov . Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin , whom beltway political mavens had built up for years as an exciting Republican reformer with big `` new ideas '' ( like welfare reform and school vouchers ) . In the wake of the Bush debacle , he was especially attractive as an `` outsider '' who could make the American people forget what they 'd just endured . Unfortunately , like Walker , on the stump Thompson was frighteningly unprepared , even making embarrassing gaffes about Jews and Israel , and he dropped out in August of 2007 . Undeterred by this embarrassment , the establishment once again anointed a Midwestern Governor as the GOP 's salvation for exactly the same reasons in 2014 , former Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty , who also flamed out before any votes were cast .\nThis year it was Scott Walker , who `` suspended '' his campaign yesterday after having been in precipitous free fall from front-runner to last place and facing the prospect of being booted from the main debate stage and forced to spar with Lindsey Graham at the kids ' table next time out .\nIf you don \u2019 t count Gerald Ford , who backed into the presidency by being appointed vice president and succeeding Nixon when he resigned , the GOP has never nominated a governor and only one politician from the Midwest since Alf Landon back in 1936 : Senator Bob Dole in 1996 . ( And neither of them were exactly resounding victories \u2014 Landon only got two electoral votes and Dole was soundly defeated by the incumbent Bill Clinton . ) Eisenhower more accurately belonged to the nation , not the region where he was born and his executive experience was in saving the world from fascism so such parochial electoral concerns were not particularly relevant .\nBut while it 's true that the modern electoral map is very daunting for the GOP , they seem peculiarly fixated on this region . Walker took the early lead in the Midwestern savior race , but for months people were also talking up Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder and Indiana Gov . Mike Pence as similarly excellent choices to lead the GOP out of the wilderness . Back in 2014 , as they all made pilgrimages to the Republican Governor 's Association , Politico described them this way :\n`` [ They are ] Rust Belt success stories who can revive the party \u2019 s Reagan Democrat coalition and speak to the middle class in a way Mitt Romney could not . And Republicans looking to shed the image as the party of the 1 percent say a Midwestern state executive who \u2019 s created jobs and balanced budgets might be just what the GOP needs . ''\nThe fact that they seemed to be able to transcend the party 's , shall we say , cruder side was also a big selling point . As Walker put it during his apparently impressive appearance :\n`` Strong leadership , combined with Midwestern nice , there \u2019 s just a certain appeal to that . ''\nBy strong leadership he meant that one should be as crackpot right-wing as one can get away with and not be Michele Bachmann . And Walker was that guy in every way . The New Republic described him this way :\n`` Scott Walker , the battle-hardened governor of Wisconsin , is the candidate that the factional candidates should fear . Not only does he seem poised to run\u2014he released a book last week\u2014but he possesses the tools and positions necessary to unite the traditional Republican coalition and marginalize its discontents .

His record of union bashing was second to none .\nAnd he certainly seemed nice , so nice in fact that he appeared to be something of a grinning simpleton at times , particularly on social media , where his tweeting of his dinner menus and constant pictures of himself riding on a Harley were ruthlessly mocked . While all the constituencies in the party who were presumed to be his greatest fans gave him plenty of chances , his gaffes and flip-flops made them doubt his sincerity and abilities .\nHe had been widely assumed to be the Koch brothers ' choice due to their involvement in the union busting and recall campaign in Wisconsin .
