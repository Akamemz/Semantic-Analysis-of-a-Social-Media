A coalition could take months to build , delaying any forthcoming changes . And ultimately Merkel won such a clear mandate because Germans like her slow and hesitant approach on Europe .\nUlrike Gu\u00e9rot , the German representative for the European Council on Foreign Relations , says that \u201c there is a mismatch of expectations \u201d between what Europe seeks from Germany and Germany 's ability to follow through .\nEuropeans , who historically wanted Germany restrained , now expect it to play a leading role in forging a more functional Europe .
