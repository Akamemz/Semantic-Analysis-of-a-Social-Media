On Jan. 1 , it is scheduled to rise to 55 percent beginning with inheritances exceeding $ 1 million .\nThe political drama in Washington over the weekend was given greater urgency by the fear that the economic gains of the past two years could be lost if no deal is reached .\nSome of the consequences of Congressional inaction would be felt almost at once on Tuesday , in employee paychecks , doctors \u2019 offices and financial markets . Analysts said the effect would be cumulative , building over time .\nAn early barometer would probably be the financial markets , where skittish investors , as they have during previous Congressional cliffhangers , could send the stock market lower on fears of another prolonged period of economic distress .\nIn 2011 , the political battles over whether to raise the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit prompted Standard & Poor \u2019 s to downgrade its rating of American debt , suggesting a higher risk of default .
