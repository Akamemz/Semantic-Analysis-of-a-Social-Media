( Oct. 27 ) AP\nWASHINGTON \u2014 FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau 's previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clinton 's handling of classified information , restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee 's conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting away .\nIn a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision , Comey said `` the FBI can not yet assess '' whether the information is `` significant '' nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment .\nBut an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials , perhaps thousands of emails , were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl .
