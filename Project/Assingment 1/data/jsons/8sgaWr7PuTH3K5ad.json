    "content": "The direction that the post-pandemic world takes \u2013 whether we will see a reset or a return to our old ways \u2013 will depend largely on governments , businesses , and international organizations . But the landscape in which they will be working has changed . People power , in one form or another , seems here to stay .\nOne recurring theme in the series has been the way in which ordinary citizens , from the Persian Gulf to America \u2019 s Midwest , have risen up to press for solutions to their problems . They have defied a widespread loss of trust in the authorities and asserted their sense of agency , their faith that they can make a difference .\nBut the catastrophic spread of the coronavirus has brought to a head many of the issues we had already intended to consider . It has freeze-framed the world , forcing citizens to confront challenges ranging from climate change to inequality , race relations , and global governance . And it has raised new voices .\nWhen The \u2588\u2588\u2588 launched its \u201c Navigating uncertainty \u201d series in February , exploring the ways in which the world seemed to have come unmoored from its traditional political , economic , and social tethers , we did not dream of the global COVID-19 pandemic .\nOn one side , a lawnmower ; on the other , a leaf blower . There \u2019 s an electric fan and a space heater . And a laptop , on which to write or WhatsApp or Zoom . And in the age of COVID-19 , I \u2019 m constantly aware that I am one of the very luckiest ones . I \u2019 m healthy . Unlike millions around the world , I \u2019 m able to self-isolate . I can work remotely . So can my wife . We have running water , electricity , Wi-Fi . A home of our own .\nYet even so , our life has changed beyond recognition . And the whole world has been thrown into flux \u2013 not just by the pandemic , but by a cacophony of social , political , and economic crosscurrents \u2013 at a time when the old post-World War II order and institutions were already under unprecedented pressure .\nI wonder how many of the changes in my own life will prove lasting . And far more importantly for the world , how many of the COVID-induced changes , in public health and education , in race-relations and climate change , will persist ? Could the recent trend toward populism and narrow nationalism give way to some form of resurgent international cooperation ?\nAnd will today \u2019 s single most important international rivalry \u2013 between a United States that has been in diplomatic retreat and an increasingly assertive China \u2013 become more starkly adversarial in the wake of heightened public sparring over the coronavirus ?\nOdd though this may seem , given the enormous number of lives and jobs tragically lost to COVID-19 , an issue-by-issue look into the post-pandemic future offers reason , if not for unbridled optimism , at least for cautious hope .\nMany of these potentially hopeful strands emerged in a Monitor series , beginning early this year and concluding with this article , called \u201c Navigating uncertainty. \u201d Planned well before the first coronavirus cases emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan , it drew on our writers from around the globe and sought to delve into the ways that , even before COVID-19 , our world had become untethered from decades-old institutions and alliances , and from basic life assumptions .\nThe series explored the many forces pulling nations , and sometimes citizens , apart from each other . It covered the growing ambitions abroad , and authoritarianism at home , of China under leader Xi Jinping . It looked into the appeal of strongman populist leaders like Brazil \u2019 s Jair Bolsonaro , and at the way technology and social media have become powerful tools for right-wing extremism .\nBut it also told another story , one that seems especially relevant and hopeful in a world that was changing dramatically as the series unfolded , influenced by COVID-19 and by the international wave of popular protest in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in the U.S .\nThat other story was one of remarkable human resilience . It was about individuals and communities taking ownership of problems they faced and pressing for their resolution . And it was all the more striking because it seemed at odds with a powerful trend that has fed polarization and populism in many countries : a loss of trust in government and a loss of the sense of agency that anything they could do as individuals could really change the course of events .\nA number of examples in the Monitor series stood out . There were the \u201c citizens \u2019 juries \u201d discussing and debating , learning and listening , and recommending policies at local or national level to confront climate change . The extraordinary determination of human-rights activists in Egypt and Gulf states to keep pushing , at potential risk to their liberty or even their lives , for the values that inspired the Arab Spring a decade ago .\nThere were major business figures trying to refashion and reform a capitalist economic system that is increasingly favoring shareholders and top executives over the interests of employees , customers , and society as a whole .\nAnd there was a whole country , or an almost-country . Somaliland split itself off from Somalia in 1991 during that country \u2019 s civil war . It remains desperately poor .\nYet in the decades since declaring itself a state , it has established and maintained peace . It has built a working democracy . Through assiduous efforts to secure financial support from diaspora Somalilanders in the U.S. , Europe , and elsewhere , it is staying afloat . And all of this without international recognition as a country \u2013 or , crucially , the access to international aid funds that such recognition would bring .\nIt might well be said , of course , that the prospect of any of this leading to real change remains daunting . Progress on climate change is still going to require international action , not to mention short-term costs that may prove particularly unappealing amid the economic downturn from the pandemic . The Arab Spring has given way to an Arab winter , with old-style authoritarian rulers back in command .\nFor business leaders , talking about reform is easier than actually changing the way they see their bottom line . And the prospect of international recognition for Somaliland remains roughly zero : The international community is wary about setting a precedent for other potential breakaway states .\nStill , the context for these examples of resilience , of human agency in action , has changed dramatically over recent months .\nOne reason is the pandemic itself . It has put governments worldwide through an unprecedented stress test , and revealed a lack of any coherent , truly international response . It has shone a glaring spotlight on issues like climate change and gaping economic inequalities . Most significantly , it has interrupted life-as-usual for millions upon millions of people ; it has freeze-framed our world , forcing us to stop and look afresh .\nJacquelyn Martin/AP Demonstrators protest near the White House in Washington June 6 , 2020 , over the killing of George Floyd as he was detained by police in Minneapolis . In the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s death , polling shows dramatic movement in Americans \u2019 opinions on police brutality and racial injustice .\nThe wave of protest against racism and police violence following George Floyd \u2019 s killing is more than just a rekindling of human agency . With at least some policy changes at local or state level already announced , it has validated and vindicated it . The protests have also served as a reminder that the power of social media can be put to work by anybody , not only far-right political parties or populist politicians .
