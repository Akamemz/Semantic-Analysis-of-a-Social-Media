No Democrats backed the bill , and a slew of Republicans opposed it as well .\nThe vote is a major victory for President Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan after months of false starts and intraparty dissension . Immediately after the vote , Republicans ditched the Capitol for the White House to celebrate alongside the president in the Rose Garden .\n`` A lot of us have been waiting seven years to cast this vote , '' Ryan said on the House floor just before the vote , adding that many Republicans were elected on a promise to end the Democratic health care law . `` Are we going to meet this test ? Are we going to be men and women of our word ? ''\nBut the bill \u2019 s passage is far from assured in a skeptical Senate . The only guarantee so far is the seismic political impact . For House Republicans , it \u2019 s the fulfillment of a seven-year promise to back a bill gutting the 2010 health law . For Democrats , it \u2019 s a chance to harness surging energy of Obamacare defenders to oust Republican lawmakers from office .\nIn the moments after the vote , liberal activist groups claimed they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars , and Democrats made clear how they see the aftermath playing out : `` Na na na na , hey , hey , hey , goodbye ! '' they sang while waving at Republicans immediately after the vote closed . Protesters on the steps of the Capitol chanted `` 2018 . ''\nSome of their ripest targets who backed the bill \u2014 such as Reps. Darrell Issa of California , Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois \u2014 hail from districts where Hillary Clinton won in November and were already high on Democratic target lists .\nThe bill now heads to the Senate where it awaits an uncertain fate . Many Senate Republicans have already signaled their concerns with the AHCA .\n\u201c A bill \u2014 finalized yesterday , has not been scored , amendments not allowed , and 3 hours final debate \u2014 should be viewed with caution , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) tweeted Thursday afternoon .\nThe vote was the product of high-pressure negotiations between various Republican factions , who often overcame a lack of trust to forge a tenuous accord . The hard-line House Freedom Caucus , which helped sink an initial version of the bill , delivered near-unanimous support for the final product after winning concessions to let states opt out of some central Obamacare regulations .\nIn the 24 hours before the vote , the House whip team was still squeezing support from moderates , who rebelled against the bill after the Freedom Caucus came aboard . But House vote-counters managed to corral last-minute support from members like California Reps. Jeff Denham and David Valadao . Another holdout , Rep. Mark Amodei ( R-Nev. ) , long a `` no '' vote , also dropped his objection late Wednesday , according to two GOP sources . On Thursday morning , several other longtime undecided members came out in support of the bill , including Reps. John Faso of New York and Brian Mast of Florida .\nA series of high-profile Obamacare failures over the past few days also appeared to tip a few more Republicans into the `` yes '' column .\nGOP leaders during their closed-door conference meeting Thursday pointed out that the last insurance company on the Iowa exchange withdrew its participation this week , leaving thousands of Americans with no choice for insurance . They pointed to Aetna 's withdrawal from the Virginia exchange , announced Tuesday .
