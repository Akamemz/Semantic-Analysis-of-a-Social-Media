    "content": "Journalism has been among the heroes of the # MeToo movement . Journalism has surfaced the women who were finally ready to speak out against Harvey Weinstein , stalled and almost blocked the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation , and triggered the re-arrest of Jeffrey Epstein . Journalism has stepped into the void that had been created by an economic system in which wealthy men could use an array of legal workarounds\u2014from NDAs to threats of blackballing to payoffs and intimidation\u2014to avoid the consequences of their actions ; a sobering lesson in all the ways the law and lawyers can be deployed to contract out of legal liability . If Epstein stands for anything , it \u2019 s how grotesquely an army of well-paid lawyers with insider connections can distort legal accountability and redress , right to the end . So journalism and journalists have stepped up to do the work that courts and lawyers and money had been able to stymie .\nIt \u2019 s easy to conclude that this is a good thing . In so many cases , serious journalists have conducted serious investigations , using multiple credible sources , to shine a light on powerful people behaving despicably . As a gap-filler for meaningful legal redress , it has done its job , and it has frequently prompted enormously satisfying resolutions to situations in which unspeakable abuses of power had been revealed . But as a meaningful way to correct for all of the problems it has uncovered , it is time to admit that journalism is not sufficient . Journalism is not , nor can it ever be , a fail-safe substitute for legal processes . The conversation surrounding Jane Mayer \u2019 s recent piece on Al Franken exemplifies the problem .\nLast month , the New Yorker \u2019 s prize-winning investigative reporter came out with a deeply reported piece that dug into specifics around Franken \u2019 s primary accuser , Leeann Tweeden . She did months of reporting , with dozens of sources , and based on her investigation , it \u2019 s hard not to think that Tweeden was either lying or manipulated by a right-wing media entity . Mayer also got on-the-record accounts from several senators who questioned their own roles in the events leading up to Franken \u2019 s resignation in 2017 .\nAs soon as it was published , the piece was litigated as if it was meant to be a final ruling on the former senator \u2019 s guilt or innocence . Many journalists , including writers at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , accused Mayer of writing a piece that could too easily be read as a kind of get-out-of-public-shame-jail-free card for Franken . Others praised the piece for being exactly the kind of deep , careful reporting a situation like Franken \u2019 s required , while a third group responded by reupping the accounts of their own careful reporting into allegations against Franken . The net effect was another scrum of judgment , with journalism acting as both the body of evidence and the trial mechanism . We ended up possibly more divided than we \u2019 d been before , living and luxuriating in our new home : the court of public opinion . The whole affair should serve as yet another reminder that when journalism is made to substitute for due process , things go sideways .\nAs soon as it was published , the piece was litigated as if it was meant to be a final ruling on Franken \u2019 s guilt or innocence .\nThis is not for lack of effort on the part of journalists , but for lack of institutional power . A chief complaint about Mayer \u2019 s piece was that she didn \u2019 t interview some of the other accusers ( several of them declined to speak with her ) or gave short shrift to their accounts . The critique first serves to demonstrate how , rather than litigating the actual decisions made by the Senate , we are litigating how journalism is done . But Mayer \u2019 s lack of interviews with these women reveals one of the main flaws with thinking that reporting can serve as legal process . Journalists can \u2019 t issue subpoenas . They can \u2019 t take depositions . Journalists do not have the capacity to take sworn testimony under oath .
