If you believe those decisions could turn out to be scandals , it 's difficult for me to disagree . If you believe Trump 's admiration for authoritarians in Russia undermines our standing in the world , I 'm there as well .\nThen again , recklessly throwing around words like `` impeachable '' and `` treason '' before the evidence exists to level those consequential charges also puts party over country . Hysteria also erodes trust in our institutions for nothing more than political gain .\nYou will , for instance , have to read six paragraphs into Reuters ' recent highly shared scoop headlined `` Exclusive : Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians : sources '' to learn that `` people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far . ''\nFor those keeping score , despite ceaseless leaking from the intelligence community , there has really been no evidence offered so far to prove `` collusion '' between Trump officials and Russia to `` hack the election '' \u2014an absurd oft-used phrase that has convinced millions of Americans that their votes , their government and free will have been abducted by another country . If that day ever comes , I will write a column in favor of impeachment . Until that day , I 'm certain folks with giant platforms like David Gregory will continue claiming that the Russians `` hacked the election . ''\nConvincing your gullible flock that we live in a republic easily annexed by a rickety former superpower is not putting your country above your party .

The former president believing that appeasing the Iranians was in the strategic interests of the United States does n't make him treasonous ; it just makes him a terrible president\u2014and not the first or last .\nDoes putting your country above party mean never being skeptical of the intentions of an intelligence community that has lied to the American people repeatedly over the years and is trying to overturn an election ?\nThere are other issues to investigate\u2014potential obstruction of justice , for instance .
