''\nHe was similarly critical of Cruz , saying the Texas senator 's `` pandering on immigration may lack Trump 's rhetorical excess , but it is no less extreme . ''\nBloomberg acknowledged that he and Trump had been on `` friendly terms '' and that he had twice agreed to be on Trump 's reality TV show `` The Apprentice .
