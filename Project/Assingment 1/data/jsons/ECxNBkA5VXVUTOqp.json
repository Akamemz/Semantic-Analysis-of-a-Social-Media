But his Baltimore credentials could become more of a challenge than he initially thought after a riot erupted in the city in April .\nSpeaking in rolled-up sleeves at Federal Hill Park , O'Malley began with a call for economic fairness and closing the gap between rich and poor in America .\n`` This is the urgent work calling us forward today : to rebuild the truth of the American Dream for all Americans , '' O'Malley said . `` And to begin right now . ''\nHe touched upon last month 's unrest in Baltimore , saying the aftermath of Freddie Gray 's death was about more than race or policing in America , but about `` the scourge of hopelessness '' in the nation 's cities .\n`` There is something to be learned from that night , and there is something to be offered to our country from those flames , '' he said .\nA small group of protesters tried to interrupt his speech , shouting remarks like `` black lives matter '' and blowing on whistles . As O'Malley discussed the problem of income inequality and concentration of wealth , one protester angrily yelled out : `` You did that ! It was you !
