Obama said he would not attend because he did n't want to influence Israel 's upcoming elections , but Boehner suggested that the president simply does n't support Israel . `` What I do wonder is why the White House feels threatened because the Congress wants to support Israel and wants to hear what a trusted ally has to say , '' Boehner said on `` Face the Nation '' on Sunday . `` The American position is clear , Israel is a Jewish state . However , we do not see a need that both sides recognize this position as part of the final agreement , '' State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in March 2014.In July 2014 , during Israel 's counteroffensive Operation Protective Edge , the White House said that President Obama had personally spoken with Netanyahu via telephone . Obama `` made clear the strategic imperative of instituting an immediate , unconditional humanitarian ceasefire that ends hostilities now . '' Such an agreement would have left guns and rockets in the hands of Hamas , and left intact Hamas ' so-called `` terror tunnels '' burrowing into Israel.Israel has used airstrikes to destroy suspected nuclear reactors in Syria and Iraq in decades past , and recent reports from Middle Eastern news outlets claim that Netanyahu planned to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities last year . According to Israel National News , those same sources alleged that Israel was forced to abort the planned mission after the White House threatened to shoot the planes down as they flew through airspace in Iraq.In 2011 , Israeli pundits were upset when Obama gave a nod to the ousting of Mubarak by calling for an `` orderly transition '' to democracy in Egypt , Reuters reported at the time . When Mubarak was eventually removed from power , Israel lost a strategic ally of three decades.In December , Fox News \u2019 Ed Henry pressed White House spokesman Josh Earnest to answer questions regarding possible sanctions on the Jewish state , and the press secretary did not deny that they were under consideration.Speaking about construction activities in East Jerusalem and the West Bank , Earnest stated , `` We believe that settlements are illegitimate . `` `` So very clearly you \u2019 re not denying sanctions are on the table , even against an ally , '' said Henry . `` I \u2019 m very clearly not denying that we have strong concerns about settlement activity that \u2019 s underway in Israel , '' Earnest responded . In an interview with Vox.com , Obama said it was `` entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you 've got a bunch of violent , vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris . '' This prompted harsh criticisms from the Jewish community , who said that Obama 's comments trivialized and even outright denied the growing anti-Semitism across Europe .",
