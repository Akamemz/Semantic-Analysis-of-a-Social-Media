But for Black and Hispanic families , the numbers are unprecedented .\nDeVos , who has been criticized for standing on the sidelines during the crisis , took a tough tone . During a call with governors , DeVos slammed the Fairfax , Va. , district for its distance learning \u201c disaster \u201d in the spring and offering a choice of only zero or two days of in-person instruction moving forward , according to notes of a call , led by Vice President Mike Pence , with governors obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Earlier in the pandemic , DeVos had been more open to kids learning both online and during in-person classes .\n\u201c Education leaders need to examine real data and weigh risk . \u2026 Risk is involved in everything we do , from learning to ride a bike to riding a rocket into space and everything in between , \u201d she said .\nBut a statement Tuesday night from teachers unions , the PTA , special education administrators and secondary school principals indicated that their relationship with the White House has hit a new low .\n`` Throughout this pandemic , the administration has failed to address the needs of students , especially those students who need the most support . They have failed to listen to families and public school educators who have been on the frontlines serving their communities , '' the statement read .\n`` Public school educators , students and parents must have a voice in critical conversations and decisions on reopening schools . The president should not be brazenly making these decisions . ''\nTrump and DeVos praised Florida \u2019 s new reopening plan , which orders the state \u2019 s public schools to reopen in August for at least five days per week for all students . `` We will put out the fires as they come up , but we have to open our schools , \u201d Trump said , and he decried \u201c political statements \u201d that will keep schools closed .\n\u201c They think it 's going to be good for them politically , so they keep the schools closed . No way , \u201d he said during a roundtable discussion at the White House . \u201c So we 're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools , to get them open . And it 's very important . It 's very important for our country . It 's very important for the well-being of the student and the parents . \u201d\nTrump had tweeted on Monday : `` Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don \u2019 t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons , not for health reasons ! They think it will help them in November . Wrong , the people get it ! ''\nThe push to reopen comes as parents agonize over whether it will be safe to send their kids back to school this fall and districts wrestle with whether and how to conduct classes . The reopening of schools is vital not just to getting the economy going , but to Trump \u2019 s reelection prospects . The campaign may be banking on the issue as a way to revive his appeal among disaffected suburban women , whose support will be key .\nThe Trump campaign is also seizing on former Vice President Joe Biden 's support of teachers unions that are stalwarts of Democratic politics and challenging Biden \u2019 s commitment to helping parents get their kids back to school . The campaign \u2019 s \u201c question of the day \u201d on Tuesday for the presumptive Democratic nominee is \u201c Will you side with union bosses who want to keep schools closed or parents who want their kids to keep learning ? ''\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar backed up DeVos , saying parents should expect schools to deliver a safe learning environment for their children , even during a pandemic .\n\u201c We must reopen , \u201d he said during a White House event on reopening schools . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to get people back to work , back to school , back to health care , because we ca n't stay locked in our homes forever . It 's bad for our physical and mental and emotional health \u2014 us as adults , as well as for our kids . \u201d\nBut Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda , president of the National Education Association , said `` the reality is no one should listen to Donald Trump or Betsy DeVos when it comes to what is best for students .
