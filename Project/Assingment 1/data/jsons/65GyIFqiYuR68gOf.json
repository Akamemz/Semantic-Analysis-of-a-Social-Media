    "content": "Former FBI Director James Comey will settle several open questions on Thursday about his interactions with President Trump regarding the investigation into potential Russian collusion .\nBut those answers will open up new lines of inquiry which senators can be expected to raise during Comey \u2019 s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday .\nIn his opening statement for Thursday \u2019 s session , Comey will tell the Senate panel that he assured Trump on three separate occasions \u2014 Jan. 6 , Feb. 14 , and March 30 \u2014 that the Republican was not personally under investigation as part of the Russia collusion investigation . ( RELATED : Trump Lawyer Says He Feels \u2018 Completely And Totally Vindicated \u2019 By Comey Testimony )\nThat is seen as good news for Trump , who claimed in his May 9 letter firing Comey that the FBI chief had provided those assurances .\nOn the negative side for the commander in chief , Comey will confirm reports that Trump asked him in the Feb. 14 meeting to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn regarding his conversations with Russia \u2019 s ambassador . That revelation has already led to obstruction of justice allegations against Trump . ( RELATED : Here Are Comey \u2019 s Prepared Remarks )\nBut Comey \u2019 s comments , which were previewed in a seven-page document released by the Senate panel , raises a whole new slew of questions about Trump and the Russia investigation .\nWhy couldn \u2019 t Comey say in public what he said in private ?\nComey will testify that in addition to telling Trump three times that he was not under investigation , he provided the same information to Congress during closed briefings .\nThat discrepancy is said to be one of the main sources of Trump \u2019 s frustration with Comey . It has also been a concern for one of the lawmakers briefed on the same information given to Trump .\nSenate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley hinted last month that Comey had told him that Trump was not a target in the investigation .\n\u201c I said he should tell the public what he told Senator Feinstein and me about whether the FBI is or is not investigating the President , \u201d Grassley said in a Judiciary Committee meeting .\nComey will suggest in his testimony that he was hesitant to make public assurances about Trump in case the Russia investigation eventually turned up evidence implicating the former real estate mogul . But Comey can expect to be asked to explain his rationale for withholding the information from the public .\nIn his statement , Comey appears to cast some doubt on the claims made in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele .\nThe document , which was published by BuzzFeed News on Jan. 10 , alleges that Russian operatives have videos of Trump with Russian prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room . The dossier also alleges that Trump campaign officials colluded with Kremlin operatives to influence the election .\nComey offers no support for the dossier in his prepared remarks . He plans to say that he brought up the document in the meeting with Trump because intelligence community leadership thought it was appropriate \u201c to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material , even though it was salacious and unverified . \u201d\nComey will also state that Trump was briefed because the intelligence community officials knew that \u201c the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect . \u201d\nHe will also state that \u201c to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President , we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing . \u201d\nComey could be asked how he knew that the dossier was soon to be published . He could also be asked if he believed that the possible compromise effort against Trump was based in fact or fiction .\nThe \u201c defensive briefing \u201d cited by Comey may also generate interest from the Senate panel .\nComey would also have a chance to reveal , if he so desires , whether the FBI relied on the dossier as the basis for part of its investigation and whether he had any concerns that Steele , the former spy , was being paid by an opposition research firm connected to supporters of Hillary Clinton .\nFBI officials reportedly cited the dossier in an application for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant filed in September against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page .\nPage is mentioned in the dossier as the Trump campaign \u2019 s liaison to the Kremlin , allegations which he has strongly denied .\nSome Comey watchers have speculated that he is unlikely to give a definitive answer on whether Trump obstructed justice by requesting an end to the Flynn investigation or asking him to publicly reveal the extent of the Russia probe .\nEven if nothing bad comes to Trump & Co. from the Russia investigation itself , Democrats will hammer away on Trump \u2019 s requests to Comey . Trump \u2019 s persistence that Comey publicly announce that was not the center of the Russia investigation \u2014 as well as a request for a loyalty pledge during the Jan. 27 meeting \u2014 will only help bolster the Democrats \u2019 case .\nBut Comey is a former federal prosecutor and deputy attorney general .
