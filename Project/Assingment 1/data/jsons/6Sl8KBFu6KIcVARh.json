    "content": "Trump Signs New Order Blocking Arrivals From 6 Majority-Muslim Countries\nPresident Trump has signed a new executive order that temporarily blocks visas from being issued to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries , revoking and replacing a controversial , now-suspended executive order known as the travel ban .\nLike the initial order signed Jan. 27 , the new executive order bars arrivals from specific majority-Muslim countries for 90 days and suspends the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days . It also caps the total number of refugees admitted this fiscal year at 50,000 , instead of 110,000 .\nBut there are a series of differences . The ban announced Monday no longer includes Iraq . It explicitly does n't apply to lawful permanent residents ( green card holders ) or existing visa holders . Syrian refugees are not banned indefinitely . Refugees already formally scheduled for travel to the U.S. will be permitted to enter the country .\nThe new order also omits a section about prioritizing refugees from minority religions in their home countries . That 's the part of the initial order that , as NPR 's Domenico Montanaro has reported , `` indicates prioritizing Christians , '' and was one reason the order was challenged as a form of `` Muslim ban . ''\nThe order signed Monday will have a delayed implementation \u2014 going into effect at 12:01 a.m . ET on March 16 \u2014 to avoid the chaotic situation created by the initial order , with people in transit when their visas were nullified .\nThe new order blocks people traveling from Sudan , Syria , Iran , Libya , Somalia and Yemen . Iraq is no longer included because , the administration says , it has pledged to `` increase cooperation with the U.S. '' and share more information about its citizens .\nA senior administration official told reporters about another reason : Iraq has agreed to the `` timely repatriation '' of Iraqi citizens in the U.S. who are slated for deportation , the official said . As of last summer , Iraq was one of 23 countries considered `` recalcitrant '' for refusing to cooperate with the U.S. in deporting their citizens .\n`` Recalcitrant countries '' were raised as an issue in a separate executive order , but were n't mentioned in either of the orders on visas and travel . Some `` recalcitrant '' countries , including Iran and Libya , are affected by the visa ban ; most are not .\nAdministration officials left open the possibility that other countries could be added to future visa-issuance bans , or that countries currently on the list could be removed .\nThe White House has consistently said that the travel ban was not and is not a `` Muslim ban , '' but a policy designed to reduce the threat of a terrorist attack .\nCritics of the travel ban have challenged the selection of the seven ( now six ) countries , questioning whether it can be justified on any fact-based national security grounds . The seven countries were on an Obama administration list of `` countries of concern '' for the Visa Waiver Program , which had nothing to do with blocking travel entirely .\nAs NPR 's Greg Myre has reported , the list `` does n't include any countries from which radicalized Muslims have actually killed Americans in the U.S. since Sept. 11 , 2001 '' \u2014 like Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Pakistan or Russia .\nThe latest executive order apparently attempts to address this with a paragraph about `` conditions '' in each targeted country , and the terrorist groups with a presence or connection there .\n`` Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism , has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations , or contains active conflict zones , '' the new order states , alleging that the countries pose `` heightened risks '' to U.S. security .\nThe suspension of the U.S. refugee program has been similarly criticized . Since the Refugee Act of 1980 , there have been no deadly terror attacks by refugees . Nine people were injured in an attack by a Somali refugee last year , which is still under investigation .\nIn Monday 's executive order , the administration offered three examples of people who entered the U.S. as refugees and were convicted of terrorism-related offenses .\nTwo came from Iraq ; they are the men who lived in Bowling Green , Ky. , and were charged with supporting a terrorist group .\nAnother came from Somalia as a child refugee and was arrested for plotting an attack on a holiday event in Portland , Ore . He was a naturalized U.S. citizen by the time of his arrest .\nSpeaking on Monday , Attorney General Jeff Sessions also said that `` people seeking to support or commit terrorist attacks here will try to enter through our refugee program . '' He said hundreds of people who arrived as refugees are under FBI investigation for possible terrorism-related crimes , although the Department of Justice has refused to provide any details about these reported investigations .\nThe White House insists the first order was legal and appropriate , even though it 's being replaced by the new order .\nThat original order prompted chaos at airports and inspired protests \u2014 and dozens of lawsuits .\nThe suits were filed by `` doctors , professors , students , people fleeing violence and Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. military , '' as NPR 's Joel Rose and journalist Parker Yesko reported last month . They continued :\n`` Some [ of the plaintiffs ] were detained in American airports for hours over the weekend ; others were barred overseas from boarding planes bound for the U.S. Two Syrian brothers with visas to enter the country say they were turned around at Philadelphia International Airport and sent back to Damascus . `` Human rights organizations and attorneys general in five states jumped aboard some of the suits , and their lists of legal grievances were long . They alleged violations of the First , Fifth and 14th Amendments , which guarantee religious equality , due process and equal protection under the law , as well as denials of asylum and discriminatory visa processing . ''\nOne of the suits , brought by the state of Washington and joined by the state of Minnesota , prompted a federal judge to issue a nationwide temporary stay of Trump 's executive order on Feb. 3 .\nThe Department of Justice challenged the stay in a U.S. appeals court , but a panel of three judges upheld the suspension . As a result , the initial executive order has not been in effect for more than a month .\nThe new order , which is twice as long as the original , is meant to `` address previous concerns '' from the courts , according to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly . But it 's not likely to be the end of legal challenges .\n`` I think everyone \u2014 and I assume the government as well \u2014 expects that there will be a new round of litigation , '' Omar Jadwat , director of the Immigrants ' Rights Project at the ACLU , told NPR before the new order was released .\nIn a statement Monday , he said the new order is `` a scaled-back version that shares the same fatal flaws .
