But doubts were raised whether she would appear .\nKavanaugh was at the White House for a second straight day , but again did not meet with President Donald Trump . The president said he was \u201c totally supporting \u201d Kavanaugh and rejected calls for the FBI to investigate the accusation .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think FBI really should be involved because they don \u2019 t want to be involved , \u201d Trump said .
