But Wednesday \u2019 s primetime showdown at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley is poised to play a decisive role in culling the crowded Republican field .\nIn interviews conducted over the last week , more than a dozen top officials , donors and aides to the GOP presidential candidates laid out their expectations for the primetime debate , and provided insights into their preparations and strategic thinking .\nHere is \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s look at what to watch for in the second Republican primary debate .\n1 ) Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have something to prove .\nThe Reagan Library debate will put the spotlight on the two candidates who surged in the polls following the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland : Carson and Fiorina .\nBoth have tangled with Trump in recent days , but they plan to deal with the real estate mogul in very different ways .\nDue to his second place standing in the polls , Carson , the retired neurosurgeon , will stand next to Trump on the stage . But despite the proximity \u2013 and the fact that last week Carson got into his first sparring match with the billionaire -- those close to Carson say he \u2019 s not likely to go after Trump again because it would detract from his mission : carving out a profile as a different kind of politician .\nCarson \u2019 s greatest strength , many campaign operatives believe , is that he projects warmth . An adviser to one rival candidate said that Carson got a boost in the first debate because viewers watching at home in their living rooms perceived him as a polite , soft-spoken guest .\nThe Carson camp appreciates the need to cut a different kind of profile \u2013 and it \u2019 s reflected in the doctor \u2019 s debate prep . He prefers poring over written material , and spent Tuesday \u201c relaxing \u201d in West Palm Beach , Florida , where he lives , according to communications director Doug Watts .\n\u201c Looking and being different is of high value , \u201d said another person close to Carson .\nFor Fiorina , however , confronting Trump is a tactical necessity . The sole woman in the GOP race , the former Hewlett-Packard CEO has attacked Trump for his remarks about her physical appearance ( \u201c Look at that face \u201d ) and turned it to her advantage ; her supporters expect her to do the same onstage .\n\u201c She will not be intimidated one bit , \u201d said Keith Appell , an adviser to a super PAC supporting Fiorina . \u201c She counter-punches a lot better than these other guys . \u201d\nThe first debate on Fox News clocked in at a little less than two hours . The CNN debate Wednesday will run nearly an hour longer \u2013 somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 hours , 45 minutes .\nThe network says the longer format will draw out the candidates on policy specifics . In a recent conversation with one campaign , moderator Jake Tapper said he saw the evening as an opportunity to define where each contender stood on major issues and to clearly delineate differences between them .\nThere \u2019 s just one problem \u2013 three hours is a heckuva long time to be standing on stage under the hot lights .\nMany of campaigns hate the idea of an extended debate , which several veterans of presidential politics say is one of the longest in recent memory . One campaign adviser , who described the planned program as a \u201c mental and physical \u201d endurance test , said he was preparing his candidate by standing him behind a podium for several hours while peppering him with detailed policy questions .\nThe aide pointed out that the debate is so long that candidates need to worry about their water intake . \u201c You need to go into the debate with an empty bladder , \u201d the aide said .\nThe duration of the debate is no joke to the candidates : on Tuesday evening , CNN clarified its restroom policy to the campaigns . One bathroom break is permitted during the third commercial break , which lasts four minutes and 30 seconds .\nThen there are the relatively small dimensions of the debate stage . The size of the stage \u2013 and the large number of candidates crowded on it \u2013 means there will be less than two feet separating each podium .
