A lot of them are running for their party \u2019 s nomination next year to be its standard-bearer in the 2020 election .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has established himself as an early if unimposing frontrunner . Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are the next top polling Democrats , alternating second and third . There are also Sens . Kamala Harris , Cory Booker , and Amy Klobuchar , who have been in the fray for months . Beto O \u2019 Rourke is also in . Pete Buttigieg has picked up some steam .\nThe Democratic field includes a record number of women and nonwhite candidates , a mix of high-wattage stars and lesser-known contenders who believe they can navigate a fractured field to victory . The debates started in June , with most candidates getting a chance to appear on stage , but the number of participants started to winnow in the third debate in September . The fourth Democratic debate is being held in October .\nWhoever emerges from the Democratic primary will face Trump , who has already raised more than $ 100 million for reelection to a second term . Recent history tells us Americans usually give their presidents another four years . That should lend Trump an advantage . But the president has been historically unpopular during his first term , and the US economy \u2014 typically at the top of voters \u2019 minds \u2014 has stumbled lately .\nWe have a long way to go , in other words . It \u2019 s silly to pretend anybody knows how this campaign is going to end , and the 2016 election should have humbled all political prognosticators . Still , the 2020 campaign has already started . Here is what you need to know to get oriented .\nOn the Republican side , there is of course President Donald Trump .\nA few Republican officials \u2014 former Ohio Gov . John Kasich and popular Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan \u2014 have hinted they might challenge the president in a primary . But any primary challenger would be a huge underdog against the sitting president . Republican leaders have said they want to protect Trump by potentially having state parties change the rules for their primaries to guard against an insurgency .\nThe GOPers willing to make the leap so far are former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld , a libertarian-leaning Republican who has officially entered the race ; former radio host and former Rep. Joe Walsh , who has apologized for saying racist things on Twitter ; and former Rep. Mark Sanford , an ideological conservative who was a member of the Freedom Caucus while he was in the House .\nOn the Democratic side , the field is set , barring some unexpected late entries , and candidates are starting to drop out . They are , starting with the 10 candidates who qualified for the third debate :\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden : Biden thought hard about running in 2016 , but he decided against it , being so soon after his son Beau \u2019 s death and with the party establishment uniformly behind Hillary Clinton . He \u2019 s still very popular with Democratic voters , and the former veep apparently wasn \u2019 t sure any of the other potential candidates would beat Trump . Though surely inflated by name recognition , Biden has a sizable lead in the early Democratic primary polls .\nSen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) : The 2016 runner-up is running again . He has the biggest grassroots base of any potential candidate , and he has been the leader of the push to move the party leftward . Press reports of staff sexual misconduct within his 2016 campaign and a more competitive field will present Sanders with a very different race this time , however . Still , for many of the Democratic left , Sanders is the only candidate with the credibility to pursue their top-tier issues , like Medicare-for-all .\nSen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) : The former California attorney general started generating White House hype almost as soon as she got to the Senate in 2017 . As a younger black woman , she personifies the Democratic Party \u2019 s changing nature . She \u2019 s endorsed Medicare-for-all and proposed a major middle-class tax credit , though her days as a prosecutor may present problems with the progressive grassroots . Based on the early polls and media hype , Harris has made the biggest splash of any Democrats not named Sanders .\nSen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) : The Massachusetts senator is proudly progressive , though she tends to position herself as wanting to fix capitalism rather than replace it . She wants to outflank Trump on trade and give workers seats on corporate boards and tax extreme wealth . Warren got on the ground early in Iowa and other early states . ( You might have also heard about her releasing a DNA test in an attempt to prove she had Native American roots \u2014 a poorly executed attempt to rebut Trump \u2019 s \u201c Pocahontas \u201d taunts . )\nSen. Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) : The former Newark mayor and part-time firefighter is another fresh face with big ideas like savings accounts for newborns , and he \u2019 s also running in a Democratic primary with a lot of black voters . He \u2019 ll have to contend , though , with his work promoting charter schools ( not a favorite of the teachers unions ) and the perception that he \u2019 s close with Wall Street .\nSen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) : She will look to blend her folksy , Midwestern manner with some crossover appeal , given her history of working across the aisle with Republicans and winning elections handily in a purplish state . Klobuchar is also known for her willingness to crack down on big tech firms , focused on privacy and antitrust issues . She is struggling with a lack of name recognition , however , and she has been the subject of several recent reports about her alleged harsh treatment of staff .\nFormer Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke : The former Texas Congress member is maybe 2020 \u2019 s biggest wild card . O \u2019 Rourke built a historically successful fundraising apparatus during his losing 2018 Senate run against Ted Cruz . He \u2019 s young and he gives a good speech . Obama \u2019 s old hands seem to like him . The open question is whether his self-evidence political talents are matched by policy substance .\nSouth Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg : Something of a viral political star , though he leads a city of \u201c just \u201d 100,000 people , Buttigieg is a military veteran and a Rhodes scholar , and he would be the first openly LGBTQ president in American history . Redevelopment and infrastructure projects have been staples of his tenure as mayor .\nFormer San Antonio mayor and HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro : Castro got VP buzz in prior elections ; now he \u2019 s running in his own right after serving in Barack Obama \u2019 s Cabinet , on an aspirational message as the grandson of immigrants .\nAndrew Yang : A humanitarian-mind entrepreneur who also served under the Obama administration . He \u2019 s running on a policy platform that includes , among other things , a universal basic income that would pay out $ 1,000 a month to every American over age 18 .\nThen you have another 10 Democratic candidates still running but who failed to qualify for the third debate :\nSen. Michael Bennet ( D-CO ) : Bennet is a well-regarded but nationally little-known senator . He tacks toward the center ideologically . The passion that fuels his candidacy is a fervent frustration with the way Washington works now . Bennet believes Americans are not nearly as divided as the parties in Washington and is positioning himself accordingly .\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio : De Blasio , mayor of America \u2019 s biggest city and already the unlikely victor of a contentious Democratic primary to get there , is touting his progressive achievements in the Big Apple as a model for the nation : enacting universal pre-K , ending stop-and-frisk , and an ambitious local health care program .\nMontana Gov . Steve Bullock : Bullock , a two-term Democratic governor in a Trump-friendly state , is campaigning as a Washington outsider who will confront moneyed interests and reform campaign finance . He can also claim the successful expansion of Medicaid , with the buy-in of a Republican legislature , to showcase his bipartisan bona fides .\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard ( D-HI ) : Gabbard fires up a certain strain of antiwar progressive . She \u2019 ll face tough questions , though , about her apparent friendliness with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and her past comments on LGBTQ rights .\nRep. Tim Ryan ( D-OH ) : The Ohio congressman is pitching himself as the Democratic answer for Trump Country , arguing he can connect with the blue-collar workers the party has lost in the Midwest . He cited the closure of the Lordstown GM plant in his home state as part of his motivation for running . Ryan has a history of long-shot bids : he challenged Nancy Pelosi for the House Democratic leader post in 2016 .\nFormer Rep. John Delaney : The most notable thing about Delaney is he \u2019 s already been running for president for two years , more or less living in Iowa , the first state on the presidential calendar . But he was the first choice of just 1 percent of Iowa Democrats in a recent poll .\nFormer Rep. Joe Sestak : The retired three-star admiral and former Pennsylvania representative in Congress is a late entry to the race , announcing his campaign three days before the first Democratic debates . Sestak is pitching himself heavily on his naval experience \u2014 his campaign logo prominently features the moniker \u201c Adm . Joe \u201d \u2014 and the global leadership experience that he says it provides .\nTom Steyer : The billionaire Democratic donor has decided to enter the arena himself . He first rose to political prominence for his focus on combatting climate change and lately he has been on a crusade to convince congressional Democrats to impeach Trump . Steyer is positioning himself as a ( well-funded ) outsider running against a host of lifelong politicians .\nMarianne Williamson : A self-proclaimed \u201c bitch for God \u201d who has been a spiritual adviser to Oprah . Her previous political experience is a failed run for Congress as an independent in 2014 .\nMiramar , Florida , Mayor Wayne Messam : The mayor of a Miami suburb , it seems safe to assume Messam has the lowest name recognition of any Democrat in the race . The son of Jamaican immigrants , he \u2019 s raised wages for city workers as mayor and confronted the Republican-led state government over gun control .\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) : Gillibrand had evolved over the years from a centrist Democrat in the House to a progressive . She endorsed Medicare-for-all and universal paid family leave ; a pillar of her Senate career has been cracking down on sexual assault in the military . Gillibrand was presenting herself as a young mom in tune with the # MeToo era and the Democratic women who powered the party to historic wins in the 2018 midterms .\nFormer Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper : Hickenlooper is a moderate ex-governor who pitched his ability to work across the aisle . On the issues , he touted his record on gun violence , environmental regulations , and expanding Medicaid . He conveyed an everyman persona , having founded a Denver brewery before he ever ran for public office . He decided to run for the Democratic nomination to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Garder in 2020 instead .\nWashington Gov . Jay Inslee : Inslee centered his work on environmental issues and the threat of climate change . He has pushed a bill to get his home state off coal energy and all other carbon-producing energy sources by 2045 . It hasn \u2019 t always been smooth \u2014 voters in Washington rejected an Inslee-supported carbon fee in 2015 \u2014 but the governor hoped to quickly build a profile by focusing relentlessly on humanity \u2019 s direst existential threat . He has opted instead to seek a third term as governor .\nRep. Seth Moulton ( D-MA ) : Another Pelosi skeptic who helped lead the unsuccessful rebellion to stop her from becoming House Speaker again in 2016 . Moulton , who represents a district in Massachusetts and is an Iraq War veteran , positioned himself as a moderate in contrast to the socialist energy animating the left and seeking to take over his party .\nFormer Sen. Mike Gravel : The 88-year-old former senator , famed for reading the Pentagon Papers into the congressional record , ran 2020 \u2019 s oddest campaign . Two teenagers convinced Gravel to launch a protest candidacy targeting the center-left and the forever war of mainstream American foreign policy . He endorsed Gabbard and Sanders after he \u2019 d exited the race .\nWho else might run for president in the 2020 election ?\nThe field might finally be set . There are a handful of names we \u2019 re still watching \u2014 former senator , Secretary of State and presidential nominee John Kerry and Georgia state senator Stacey Abrams chief among them \u2014 but otherwise , we have all the candidates we \u2019 re going to get .\nWhen are the next 2020 Democratic presidential primary election debates ?\nThe Democratic National Committee announced it will hold 12 debates , starting in June 2019 and extending into 2020 .\nThe next Democratic debate is October 15 ( with a second night possible on October 16 ) and will be held in Westerville , Ohio . At the moment , 11 candidates have qualified for the debate stage :\nUnder the current rules , candidates need to attain either 130,000 individual donors or more than 2 percent in at least four national or early primary state polls . It looks like that will shrink the field considerably , from the 20 candidates who qualified for the first two debates , a number that will be halved ( or almost ) in September .\nGoing forward , if there are 10 or fewer candidates , all of them are expected to debate on the same night on the same stage . But if the number of qualifying candidates hits 11 again , the debate could be spread over two nights , as it was for the first two debates .\nWhen are the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election and caucus nights ?\nThe votes that matter won \u2019 t be cast for another six months . We have months of formal announcements , speeches , policy rollouts , campaign gossip , unpredictable polling , and some debates before any elections happen , when candidates start collecting the delegates they \u2019 ll need to claim the nomination .\nEarly momentum is always critical , especially in a big field with so many candidates trying to prove that they \u2019 re viable . With that in mind , the first two months of the primary schedule :\nSouth Carolina primary March 3 ( \u201c Super Tuesday \u201d ) : Alabama , California , Colorado , Massachusetts , Minnesota , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Vermont primaries\nAlabama , California , Colorado , Massachusetts , Minnesota , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Vermont primaries March 7 : Louisiana primary\nLouisiana primary March 10 : Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Ohio primaries ; North Dakota caucuses\nMichigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Ohio primaries ; North Dakota caucuses March 17 : Arizona , Florida , Illinois primaries\nThere are at least three more months of primaries and caucuses after that . But the candidates will focus their attention and organizing on the earlier states , and we should know a lot more about the field and the strongest candidates once the first sprint is over .\nThe short version is you have to win a majority of the delegates .\nEvery state has different rules for its primary elections or caucuses in terms of allocating delegates . Candidates win delegates proportional to where they finish in the results , though they generally have to hit a minimum threshold of 15 percent to be awarded any delegates .\nIn terms of numbers , there will be an estimated 3,768 delegates for the 2020 Democratic National Convention ( where the nominee will be formally selected ) up for grabs during the primary elections . One candidate needs to win at least 1,885 delegates to be nominated .\nYou might hear talk of a \u201c brokered \u201d or \u201c contested \u201d convention if no candidate gets the necessary delegates to win on the first ballot . But that hasn \u2019 t happened for decades , and it \u2019 s way too early to think that will happen in 2020 . That doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s not a possibility , but let \u2019 s wait for some votes to come in before we start up that parlor game .\nDemocrats have made one major change from the 2016 primary on \u201c superdelegates \u201d \u2014 elected officials , party leaders , and other prominent Democrats who have votes in addition to the regular delegates awarded by state elections . In the past , superdelegates didn \u2019 t have to follow any rules and could back whichever candidate they desire and make up their minds at any point in the process . When most of them endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 , it gave her a built-in delegate advantage over Bernie Sanders , though she still won enough votes independent of the superdelegates to secure the nomination .\nIn a series of reforms , the DNC has stripped superdelegates of a vote on the first ballot . So unless the convention has to move to second or third votes because no candidate has the sufficient number of delegates \u2014 something that hasn \u2019 t happened since the 1950s \u2014 superdelegates won \u2019 t matter in 2020 . ( Arguably , they never did . Many pointed out it was unlikely for superdelegates to use their power to overturn the outcome of the primary system , but it nevertheless created consternation within the party . )",

With that in mind, the first two months of the primary schedule:\n\nFebruary 3: Iowa caucuses\n\nIowa caucuses February 11: New Hampshire primary\n\nNew Hampshire primary February 22: Nevada caucuses\n\nNevada caucuses February 29: South Carolina primary\n\nSouth Carolina primary March 3 (\u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d): Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont primaries\n\nAlabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont primaries March 7: Louisiana primary\n\nLouisiana primary March 10: Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio primaries; North Dakota caucuses\n\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio primaries; North Dakota caucuses March 17: Arizona, Florida, Illinois primaries\n\nThere are at least three more months of primaries and caucuses after that. But the candidates will focus their attention and organizing on the earlier states, and we should know a lot more about the field and the strongest candidates once the first sprint is over.\n\nHow do you win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination?\n\nThe short version is you have to win a majority of the delegates.\n\nEvery state has different rules for its primary elections or caucuses in terms of allocating delegates. Candidates win delegates proportional to where they finish in the results, though they generally have to hit a minimum threshold of 15 percent to be awarded any delegates.\n\nIn terms of numbers, there will be an estimated 3,768 delegates for the 2020 Democratic National Convention (where the nominee will be formally selected) up for grabs during the primary elections. One candidate needs to win at least 1,885 delegates to be nominated.\n\nYou might hear talk of a \u201cbrokered\u201d or \u201ccontested\u201d convention if no candidate gets the necessary delegates to win on the first ballot. But that hasn\u2019t happened for decades, and it\u2019s way too early to think that will happen in 2020. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a possibility, but let\u2019s wait for some votes to come in before we start up that parlor game.\n\nDemocrats have made one major change from the 2016 primary on \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2014 elected officials, party leaders, and other prominent Democrats who have votes in addition to the regular delegates awarded by state elections. In the past, superdelegates didn\u2019t have to follow any rules and could back whichever candidate they desire and make up their minds at any point in the process. When most of them endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, it gave her a built-in delegate advantage over Bernie Sanders, though she still won enough votes independent of the superdelegates to secure the nomination.\n\nIn a series of reforms, the DNC has stripped superdelegates of a vote on the first ballot. So unless the convention has to move to second or third votes because no candidate has the sufficient number of delegates \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened since the 1950s \u2014 superdelegates won\u2019t matter in 2020. (Arguably, they never did. Many pointed out it was unlikely for superdelegates to use their power to overturn the outcome of the primary system, but it nevertheless created consternation within the party.)\n\nOkay. So who will be the next president?\n\nHa! You almost got me.",
