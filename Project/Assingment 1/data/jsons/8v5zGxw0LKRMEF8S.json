That, in turn, means those people might be able to start to return to their usual routines sooner rather than later.\n\nNow for the bad news.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know if they actually had the coronavirus because they haven\u2019t been tested, and there isn\u2019t a test available yet that can tell if someone already recovered from the disease. Even if they did get a coronavirus test, or an antibody test to show a past infection, scientists don\u2019t yet know for sure if beating novel coronavirus once means long-term immunity.
