    "content": "In the run-up to the 2016 election , Republicans are trying to position themselves as the party of the middle class . In a recent essay , Thomas Edsall writes , \u201c The Republican appropriation of leftist populist rhetoric ( and even policies ) poses a significant threat to liberal prospects in 2016. \u201d It may well work , but not because Republicans are in fact reformist , but rather because voters and pundits eschew data and instead focus on rhetoric . When it comes to actual empirical evidence , the answer is indisputable : Democrats preside over far more income growth for the middle class than Republicans .\nPrinceton University 's Larry Bartels has two studies on politics and income distribution , and together they encompass almost a century . His finding : under Republicans , the poor and middle class see almost no income growth , while under Democrats , they see dramatic growth ( see charts ) . As he notes elsewhere , even after numerous controls , these partisan differences remain . \u201c Every Republican president in the past 60 years has presided over increasing income inequality , including Dwight Eisenhower in the midst of the \u2018 Great Compression \u2019 of the post-war decades , '' Bartels writes . `` And every Democratic president except one ( Jimmy Carter ) has presided over decreasing or stable inequality . \u201d\nIn another recent study , Alan Blinder and Mark Watson find that on a number of economic indicators , the country fares far better when a Democrat is in office . GDP growth is 1.8 point higher under a Democratic presidency , unemployment is lower , corporate profits are higher , the S & P grows faster and wages grow faster . This difference is not found in other countries , suggesting that the particularly rabid nature of American conservatism may be an important factor . It could also be that the effect is purely luck ( although there is evidence to suggest that left-wing governments can facilitate growth ) . But the fact that the economy grows faster under Democrats is not enough to explain why the middle-class fares better . As the chart below shows , much of the distribution leg-work occurs after taxes and transfers . This isn \u2019 t to say Democrats don \u2019 t shape the pre-tax distribution ( they do ) , but rather that simple differences in market distributions of income can \u2019 t explain the difference .\nAs John B. Judis argued \u2014 contrary to his seminal proposition of an \u201c Emerging Democratic Majority \u201d \u2014 the future now belongs to the Republican party . It \u2019 s increasingly likely that Democrats will continue to have a slight advantage in the electoral college , but struggle elsewhere , for reasons I \u2019 ve previously discussed . So , while Judis ' thesis that middle-class whites are dramatically shifting right is contestable , he raises an important point : Middle-class Americans like services but dislike taxes , and Democrats currently appear to be the party of taxes . And so , the struggle for Democrats is what Suzanne Mettler refers to as the \u201c submerged state. \u201d That is , the way the government actually benefits the middle class often goes unseen , while taxes , particularly the income tax , are very obvious . Mettler notes that our federal tax code is full of handouts like the Mortgage Interest Deduction , but these tax benefits primarily benefit the affluent and middle class . \u201c Our government is integrally intertwined with everyday life from healthcare to housing , but in forms that often elude our vision , \u201d she argues .\nThe implication is that many people who believe themselves independent of government support in fact rely heavily on it . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 10 largest tax breaks cost the government $ 900 billion in 2013 . But the benefits accrue to the wealthy : The top 1 percent gets 17 percent of the benefits and the bottom quintile only 8 percent . As the New York Times reported in 2012 ,\n`` The government safety net was created to keep Americans from abject poverty , but the poorest households no longer receive a majority of government benefits\u2026 The share of benefits flowing to the least affluent households , the bottom fifth , has declined from 54 percent in 1979 to 36 percent in 2007 , according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis published last years . \u201d\nAs Christopher Howard notes in his book , `` The Hidden Welfare State , '' \u201c There is , still , a misconception that U.S. social programs primarily benefit the poor . That is not true for the visible welfare state direct expenditures , and it is an absurd claim to make about the hidden welfare state . \u201d\nAs the political science literature shows persuasively , Democrats are far better for economic growth , and particularly middle-class and poor income growth , than Republicans . Yet even liberal commentators often fail to notice this . ( Kevin Drum , for example , argues that \u201c Democrats simply do n't consistently support concrete policies that help the broad working and middle classes. \u201d ) By focusing on major policies , these critics miss what Nathan Kelly calls , \u201c market conditioning , \u201d or the ways in which left-leaning governments shift market distributions through regulation , monetary and fiscal policy and other non-explicitly redistributive functions . In fact , there is a strong literature showing that parties on the left shift the income distribution . One notable example : While conservatives savagely attack unions , which dramatically shift the income distribution , while Democrats leave them alone . Further , Democrats tend to favor expansionary economic policies , while Republicans try to clamp down on inflation -- which primarily benefits the rich . A cross-country study by Isa Camyar finds that firms perform better under left-wing governments because such governments spend more money on public fixed investment . This will naturally lead to higher wages . And while the real value of the minimum wage has increased 16 cents a year under Democratic presidents , it has decreased by 6 cents per year under Republicans . Liberal governments also do more to reduce unemployment , which is significant for earnings at the bottom of the income distribution .\nSo , while there is evidence that the in the era of globalization and finance , liberal parties can \u2019 t do as much to impact the distribution of income , it is nonetheless clear that liberals matter , as Bartel \u2019 s recent data extend to 2012 .\nOn the other hand , the conservative premise \u2014 that inequality will increase growth and thereby benefit the poor and middle class \u2014 has been so thoroughly demolished that it can \u2019 t be stated with a straight face . A large body of empirical literature suggests that massive tax cuts for top earners do little but increase incomes at the top . Branko Milanovic and Roy van der Weide find , \u201c high levels of inequality reduce the income growth of the poor and , if anything , help the growth of the rich. \u201d Dan Andrew , Christopher Jencks and Andrew Leigh find that whatever modest effect that inequality has on growth is mitigated by the impact of inequality on the bottom . Intelligent conservative commentators have essentially surrendered the supply-side debate .\nIt 's clear a Democratic Party is better for middle- and low-income growth . However , while it \u2019 s entirely mythological that the poor tend to vote Republican , it is still true that Democrats have trouble with the white middle class . An important reason for this is that Democrats are often seen as the party that benefits the poor , particularly poor black Americans . My investigation of ANES data shows this phenomenon in action : Whites are opposed to welfare , but support helping the poor ( see chart ) . A large literature shows that opposition to welfare and government is driven by racial animus .
