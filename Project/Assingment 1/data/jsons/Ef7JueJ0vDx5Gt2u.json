Bolton stressed that military options remain on the table after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone last week , just days after accusing Tehran of carrying out limpet mine attacks on civilian oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz .\nMr. Trump considered responding to the drone downing with targeted attacks on Iranian radar and missile batteries but pulled back after learning that 150 Iranians would be killed .\nAlthough that decision seems to have temporarily cooled tensions between the two sides , the administration said Iran should not test the U.S. again .\n\u201c Iran should not mistake restraint for a lack of resolve , \u201d Mr. Pence told CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nSpeaking in Jerusalem alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Mr. Bolton sounded a similar note .\nSEE ALSO : Trump on John Bolton : \u2018 If it was up to him , he \u2019 d take on the whole world at one time \u2019\n\u201c No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East . As President Trump said on Friday , our military is rebuilt , new and ready to go , \u201d he said .\nRelations between Washington and Tehran have deteriorated since Mr. Trump last year pulled the U.S. out of a multinational deal limiting Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and put into place a crippling set of economic sanctions . More sanctions are expected to be announced Monday , officials said .\nOn the heels of his decision to forgo airstrikes , Mr. Trump has extended an olive branch to Iran and reiterated that he is open to talks . He said that if Tehran comes back to the table and agrees to U.S. conditions \u2014 including giving up all nuclear weapons ambitions , stopping its support for terrorism and other steps \u2014 then the nation \u2019 s sagging economy will recover .\n\u201c If Iran wants to become a wealthy nation again , become a prosperous nation \u2014 we \u2019 ll call it \u2018 Let \u2019 s make Iran great again , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday . \u201c But they \u2019 re never going to do it if they think , in five or six years , they \u2019 re going to have a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nCritics have praised Mr. Trump for showing restraint and avoiding airstrikes that could have sparked a broader war in the Middle East , but they still argue that the president has no comprehensive strategy for dealing with Iran and is largely responsible for where things stand .\n\u201c This has been folly . There is no strategy here , \u201d Sen. Cory A. Booker , New Jersey Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate , told ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week \u201d on Sunday . \u201c We have a president that seems to be doing this like a reality TV show and trying to build more drama and trying to make foreign policy by tweet .
