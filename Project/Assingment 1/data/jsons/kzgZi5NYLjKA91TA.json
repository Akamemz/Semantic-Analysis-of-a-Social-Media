We \u2019 re a better country than that . We don \u2019 t abandon our fellow Americans when times get tough . We keep the faith with them until they start that new job . \u201d\nThe counter-argument , offered by some congressional Republicans and others , is that extending unemployment benefits yet again actually makes it less likely that out-of-work Americans will go out and find \u201c that new job , \u201d as the president put it .\nStill , it \u2019 s politically treacherous for the GOP to be seen as standing in the way of financial help for those still looking for work in a down economy . That \u2019 s led some Republicans to seek a bipartisan solution .\nA Senate bill to extend benefits for three months , sponsored by Sen. Dean Heller , Nevada Republican , and Sen. Jack Reed , Rhode Island Democrat , could come up for a vote as soon as Monday .\nSenate leaders , however , reportedly aren \u2019 t sure it will garner the needed 60 votes to proceed .\nThe past several days have seen an all-out push from the administration and congressional Democrats ahead of next week \u2019 s possible vote .
