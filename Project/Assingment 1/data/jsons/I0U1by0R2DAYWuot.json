    "content": "Over the past four months , the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on President Obama 's approval rating have overtaken most of the common arguments about 2014 politics . And as shallow as that analysis seems to people who take a longer view of the law 's prospects , I get it . The last three months of 2013 were genuinely tough going , and there 's just no denying that if Obama 's public standing does n't improve , Democrats will be in for a very rough cycle .\nI do n't know if that means Obama should 've dwelled on the healthcare law more than he did in his State of the Union address or not . You could argue it either way . He mocked the GOP 's now-faltering repeal obsession and encouraged people to help their friends and family members enroll . But it was just one small piece of a speech about a lot of different issues .\nSome of these were small-bore issues and others were fanciful , given how logjammed American politics is today . But when it was over , what actually struck me was how many of them were enduring , feasible liberal goals .\nIntentionally or otherwise , Obama 's speech was a reminder to Democrats that the storm clouds of Obamacare implementation have obscured their view of the popular platform the party ran on so confidently in 2012 . That there are a series of issues that animate Democratic constituencies on the docket , both ahead of 2014 and beyond , and all of them are political and substantive winners for the party .\nHere are some of the big ones , from Obama 's prepared remarks :\nFederally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones . That \u2019 s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year \u2019 s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery .\nIf we are serious about economic growth , it is time to heed the call of business leaders , labor leaders , faith leaders , and law enforcement \u2013 and fix our broken immigration system . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted .
