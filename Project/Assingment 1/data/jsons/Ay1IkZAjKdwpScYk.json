And when the television networks make that call as soon as New Jersey polls close on June 7 , it will leave Bernie Sanders with a hard choice : whether to directly acknowledge it or intensify his fight to the July convention in Philadelphia .\nThe Vermont senator has shown few signs of being ready to concede . And if he wins California , he wo n't .\nThe outcome there will determine the course he takes in the seven-week runup to the convention , top Sanders aides and high-profile supporters say , either driving his decision to battle on for the nomination or to begin focusing on the party policy and platform changes he wants to make .\nA win in California , his top advisers believe , will enable Sanders to make a much more aggressive pitch to superdelegates and Democrats around the country in the coming weeks . He will be able to point to victories over Clinton in more than 20 states \u2014 capped by the biggest , bluest and most diverse in the nation . The symbolic value of winning California , they think , would underscore his point that the future of the party is on his side and rattle superdelegate confidence in her candidacy .\nA loss , however , would dismantle that argument . The Sanders camp believes a defeat there would take the wind out of his sails , in no small part because of the negative media narrative that would result after having spent so much time in the state .\nSanders hasn \u2019 t directly addressed the issue of how he \u2019 ll respond Tuesday evening , though it \u2019 s clearly something that \u2019 s on his mind . He has shown no outward sign of bowing to the increasingly loud grumblings from Clinton-allied officials \u2014 most recently Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \u2014 urging him to drop out after California , and he brushes aside the suggestion that his prolonged primary challenge could hurt Clinton against Donald Trump .\n\u201c On Tuesday night , on the 7th , you \u2019 re going to hear from the media saying that Hillary Clinton has received whatever it is \u2014 80 or 90 delegates \u2014 which she certainly will from New Jersey and other states , and they \u2019 ll say the primary process is over , Secretary Clinton has won , \u201d Sanders told a crowd in Santa Cruz last week . \u201c The Democratic National Committee will tell you it \u2019 s not factually correct . The truth is no candidate \u2014 not Hillary Clinton , not Bernie Sanders \u2014 will receive the number of pledged delegates , that is , the real delegates that people vote for . Neither candidate will have received the number of pledged delegates that he or she needs to become the Democratic nominee . What that means is that the superdelegates will be the people who determine who the nominee is . \u201d\n\u201c The media is in error when they lumped superdelegates with pledged delegates . Pledged delegates are real , \u201d he reiterated in a combative news conference in Los Angeles on Saturday . \u201c The Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention . \u201d\nSanders has promised to give every voter a chance to weigh in , meaning he will compete in Washington , D.C. \u2019 s June 14 primary \u2014 for which his campaign has recently sought volunteer housing .\nBut even within Sanders circles , there is considerable head-scratching and puzzling through back-of-the-envelope delegate math in an attempt to figure out what the senator will do next .\nSome aides near the top rungs of his political operation report being told to focus exclusively on Tuesday \u2019 s primaries , and not to worry about what comes next .\n\u201c Basically , he decides daily . What decides what happens after Tuesday is going to depend on what the results are , \u201d said Dottie Deans , chairwoman of the Vermont Democratic Party and a superdelegate who supports Sanders . \u201c They \u2019 ll sit down Wednesday and they \u2019 ll discuss what happened on Tuesday and decide how to go forward . ''\n\u201c I will accept any decision he makes , and I will respect any decision he makes , \u201d she added . \u201c But I \u2019 m not in any position to tell him what to do . Nor would he listen to me . \u201d\nOne consensus expectation is that the Sanders campaign team will seek to leverage the senator \u2019 s all-but-ensured status as the most successful runner-up in modern Democratic politics .\nSupporters listen to Bernie Sanders during a campaign rally at Qualcomm Stadium on June 5 in San Diego . | AP Photo\nThe possibilities include pledging to fight on with meetings and rallies , all the while making the case to superdelegates that polls show he is the stronger nominee against Donald Trump in November . Or he could effectively concede the nomination and prepare his troops for platform fights and a contentious convention in Philadelphia .\nSanders has a wide array of options as he pursues his stated goal of persuading super delegates \u2014 whose very existence he decries \u2014 to switch their support from Clinton to him . He could , for example , hold swing state rallies to make the case against nominating Clinton , an approach that might let him maintain the earned media that sustains his public image .\nBut that tack is unlikely . He hasn \u2019 t unleashed a new argument against Clinton in weeks , indicating a diminished appetite for that kind of combat , and a purple-state assault could weaken her against Trump . In addition , people close to the campaign expect the operation to severely cut back on travel after he \u2019 s spent over two weeks straight in California , largely because of the expense . The campaign has already been drastically slashing costs , and the staff is now down nearly to the group of senior advisers and an advance staff that \u2019 s necessary for large events .\nA lower-profile , but cheaper avenue to pursue might be to meet individually with as many super delegates as possible in an effort to swing them . But more and more of these party leaders and officials have spoken up about how difficult that would be after he \u2019 s denounced the superdelegate system in the first place , and prominent Sanders backers say they don \u2019 t view this alone as a practical option . It would likely take something more drastic to win over the superdelegates : none of those who support Clinton have been persuaded to swing to Sanders \u2019 side in the year-plus of campaigning so far .\nOne option floated by some Democrats \u2014 but not a popular one among Sanders \u2019 most ardent backers \u2014 is that he could concede that Clinton is the nominee but encourage his army of delegates to fight for specific platform points and rules changes at the July convention . This might be the most realistic conciliatory route , said some party officials thinking through the options , noting that it \u2019 s similar to the approach taken by Ted Cruz , who maintained until the final days of his campaign that he \u2019 d fight on to the GOP convention . But the Vermont senator has repeatedly insisted that he will take his leverage to Philadelphia , and his senior advisers have not seriously thought through how that would look without him as an active candidate .\nNot expecting a concession of any sort , Sanders \u2019 allies universally expect a major part of his role in the coming weeks will be to outline his convention hopes to his delegates .\n\u201c I think what he \u2019 s going to do is provide a lot of direction about what happens at the [ convention ] , assuming the [ Democratic National Committee ] is not going to embrace our agenda . But we are going to be in a position to at least have a minority report and vote to put our issues on the agenda , \u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro , the executive director of the Sanders-backing National Nurses United union , who referred to Tuesday \u2019 s expected declaration of Clinton as the nominee as a \u201c big lie . \u201d\n\u201c The pivot , I don \u2019 t know . It depends on how corrupt the DNC actually is once we get to Philadelphia , \u201d she said . \u201c That could determine the direction that takes . \u201d\nIn addition to the policy points that Sanders is expected to push before the convention \u2014 a $ 15 federal minimum wage and a nationwide ban on fracking , for example \u2014 he is also eyeing fundamental reforms to the Democratic nominating process , which would have to be made separately from the convention .\nThe Clinton camp has been extremely careful not to be seen as urging Sanders to get out of the race , keeping in mind her own 2008 campaign against then-Sen.
