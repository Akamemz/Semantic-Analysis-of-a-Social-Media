    "content": "We now know that Donald Trump Jr. , during the presidential campaign , met with a Russian lawyer offering information that was \u201c part of Russia and its government \u2019 s support for Mr. Trump. \u201d And we now know that the president \u2019 s eldest son was less-than-forthcoming in his previous statements on the issue .\nWhen he tweeted images of the email chain about that June 9 , 2016 , meeting , he said it was \u201c in order to be totally transparent. \u201d But that transparency came days after a misleading statement about the meeting and just as The New York Times was preparing to publish the emails .\nOn July 8 , The New York Times broke the story that Donald Trump Jr. had arranged a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer , Natalia Veselnitskaya , \u201c who has connections to the Kremlin. \u201d The president \u2019 s son-in-law and now senior adviser , Jared Kushner , and Paul Manafort , then-campaign convention manager , also attended . Here \u2019 s what Trump Jr. told the Times about that meeting in a statement :\nDonald Trump Jr. , July 8 statement : `` It was a short introductory meeting . I asked Jared and Paul to stop by . We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government , but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up . I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance , but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand . ''\nBut that was misleading and glossed over the reason for the meeting , which the Times would soon report and Trump Jr. would acknowledge .\nOn July 9 , the Times reported that Trump Jr. was \u201c promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign. \u201d His statement that day :\nTrump Jr. , July 9 statement : `` [ T ] he woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton . Her statements were vague , ambiguous and made no sense . No details or supporting information was provided or even offered . It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information . She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act . It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting . ''\nAnd by July 11 , through the Times \u2019 reporting and Trump Jr. \u2019 s own release of the emails , we knew that the meeting was explicitly about potential dirt on the soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee from a purported \u201c Russian government attorney . \u201d\nThe June 3 , 2016 , email from music publicist Rob Goldstone said that Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked Goldstone to contact Trump Jr. on behalf of his father , Aras Agalarov , a Russian real estate developer who has ties to Donald Trump Sr. , including his 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow . \u201c The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father , \u201d Goldstone wrote . \u201c This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government \u2019 s support for Mr. Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin . \u201d\nTrump Jr. responded 17 minutes later , saying that \u201c if it \u2019 s what you say I love it. \u201d Four days later , Goldstone emailed again to \u201c schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow . \u201d\nTrump Jr. \u2019 s statements on the meeting evolved as the Times gathered more information . He first said only that the meeting was \u201c primarily \u201d about the adoption of Russian children , but he later acknowledged he had agreed to a meeting promising damaging information about Clinton from , the emails say , a \u201c Russian government attorney . \u201d\nThis wasn \u2019 t the first time the newspaper had asked Trump Jr. about meetings with Russians . In its July 8 story , The New York Times noted that in an interview with the younger Trump back in March , he said he had never \u201c set up \u201d any meetings with Russians and \u201c certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way , shape or form. \u201d Further , he denied that he ever discussed government policies related to Russia with any Russians . None of that is accurate .\nThe New York Times , July 8 : `` Donald Trump Jr. had denied participating in any campaign-related meetings with Russian nationals when he was interviewed by The Times in March . 'Did I meet with people that were Russian ? I \u2019 m sure , I \u2019 m sure I did , ' he said . 'But none that were set up . None that I can think of at the moment . And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way , shape or form . ' `` Asked at that time whether he had ever discussed government policies related to Russia , the younger Mr. Trump replied , ' A hundred percent no . ' ``\nLet \u2019 s start with Trump Jr. \u2019 s assertion that he had never \u201c set up \u201d any meetings with Russians . Indeed , he did .\nThe emails between Goldstone and Trump Jr. leave no question that this meeting was \u201c set up \u201d between Trump Jr. and what was purported to be a \u201c Russian government attorney. \u201d The face-to-face meeting subsequently occurred on June 9 , 2016 , in Trump Tower .\nIn an interview on Fox News on July 11 , Trump Jr. said he may have met during the campaign with other Russians , but not in \u201c a formalized meeting . \u201d\nTrump Jr. , July 11 : `` You know , I don \u2019 t even know . I \u2019 ve probably met with other people from Russia \u2026 not in the context of actual \u2014 a formalized meeting or anything like that because why would I ? ''\nIn his meeting with the Russian attorney in June 2016 , was Trump Jr. representing the campaign \u201c in any way , shape or form \u201d ? Clearly , he was . The primary purpose of the meeting , according to Goldstone \u2019 s initial email , was \u201c to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. \u201d Further , Trump Jr. later responded that in addition to himself , he would likely be joined by \u201c Paul Manafort ( campaign boss ) \u201d and \u201c my brother-in-law. \u201d Manafort had been named campaign convention manager in March 2016 and would be named campaign manager on June 20 .\nFinally , the emails and statements from Trump Jr. about the meeting contradict his claim that he never discussed government policies related to Russia with any Russians . According to his own account of the June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya , the two discussed adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act , a law that denies entrance to the U.S. to Russian human rights abusers . The law prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt American adoption of Russian children .\nTrump Jr. told Fox News \u2019 Sean Hannity on July 11 that Veselnitskaya told \u201c a story about Russian adoption and how we could possibly help. \u201d Trump Jr. said he then quickly shut down the meeting because \u201c this wasn \u2019 t a campaign talking point . This wasn \u2019 t something we were \u2014 you know , this was not something I was going to worry about at that stage . I mean , we had a lot of bigger fish to fry . \u201d\nIn the summer of 2016 , Trump Jr. made one other notable statement on Russian interference in the election . He didn \u2019 t say anything about potential meetings , but his reaction to the suggestion that the Russian government wanted to help his father \u2019 s candidacy belied what he knew at the time .\nOn July 22 , 2016 , WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails . Two days later , on CNN \u2019 s State of the Union , host Jake Tapper had this exchange with Trump Jr .\nCNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper , July 24 , 2016 : `` Robby Mook , the campaign manager for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 I asked him about the DNC leak . And he suggested that experts are saying that Russians were behind both the leak \u2014 the hacking of the DNC emails and their release . He seemed to be suggesting that this is part of a plot to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton . Your response ? '' Trump Jr. : `` Well , it just goes to show you their exact moral compass . I mean , they \u2019 ll say anything to be able to win this . I mean , this is time and time again , lie after lie . You notice he won \u2019 t say , well , I say this . We hear experts . You know , his house cat at home once said that this is what \u2019 s happening with the Russians . It \u2019 s disgusting . It \u2019 s so phony . I watched him bumble through the interview , I was able to hear it on audio a little bit . I mean , I can \u2019 t think of bigger lies , but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do . They will lie and do anything to win . ''\nOf course , the U.S. intelligence community did later say , on Oct. 7 , 2016 , that it is \u201c confident \u201d that hacks into the email systems of the Democratic Party and its officials were directed by the Russian government . And a Jan. 6 , 2017 , declassified intelligence report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the hacking , designed to \u201c help President-elect Trump \u2019 s election chances . \u201d\nTo be clear , there is nothing in the email chain or recent reporting to suggest Trump Jr. knew anything about Russian hacking of the DNC emails . But we do know that he had been told that the promise of incriminating information about Clinton was \u201c part of Russia and its government \u2019 s support for Mr. Trump , \u201d in Goldstone \u2019 s June 3 , 2016 , email .\nAs for the elder Trump , the president was asked by ABC News \u2019 Cecilia Vega at the conclusion of a Jan. 11 press conference , about a week before he was inaugurated : \u201c Did you or anyone in your campaign have any contact with Russia leading up to or during the campaign ? \u201d Trump \u2019 s response , ABC News reported : \u201c No . Not at all. \u201d ( See the 3-minute mark of the news segment . )\nTrump Jr. said in his July 11 Fox News interview that he didn \u2019 t tell his father anything about the June 2016 meeting . President Trump also told Reuters on July 12 that he \u201c didn \u2019 t know \u201d about the meeting \u201c until a couple of days ago , when I heard about this . \u201d\nTrump calls Donald Trump Jr. 's meeting with Russian lawyer 'opposition research '\nDid Donald Trump Jr. break any laws by seeking damaging information from Russia on Hillary Clinton ?\nDonald Trump Jr. 's Russian meeting : An unusual way of conducting political research\nTrump has deep ties to Putin-connected billionaire who offered dirt on Hillary\nDonald Trump Jr. on Russia meeting : 'In retrospect , I probably would have done things a little differently '",
