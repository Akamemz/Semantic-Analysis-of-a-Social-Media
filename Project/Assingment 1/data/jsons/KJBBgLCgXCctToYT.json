Billy Graham and CEO of Samaritan 's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association , was specifically referring to his home state of North Carolina . Sixty-one percent of the state 's residents , according to the Christian Post , were against same-sex marriages but a federal judge in the state recently overturned the ban on the practice anyway . `` It 's sad when a judge is able to overrule the will of the people , '' Graham told WCNC Charlotte , an NBC affiliate , on Monday . `` This is a democracy , and the people spoke , and we 're seeing that activist judges across the country are overturning the will of the people . We saw that in California . We 're now seeing it here in North Carolina now . I do n't know what will take place . `` Last Friday , U.S. District Court Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr. struck down North Carolina 's ban on gay marriage , a move that followed the Supreme Court 's announcement that it would not hear appeals regarding the legalization of gay marriage . `` The court determines that North Carolina 's laws prohibiting same-sex marriage are unconstitutional as a matter of law , '' Cogburn wrote in his ruling . `` The issue before this court is neither a political issue nor a moral issue . It is a legal issue and it is clear as a matter of what is now settled law in the Fourth Circuit that North Carolina laws prohibiting same sex marriage , refusing to recognize same sex marriages originating elsewhere , and/or threatening to penalize those who would solemnize such marriages , are unconstitutional . `` Cogburn was appointed to his position by President Barack Obama . `` LGBT families in North Carolina will now be treated as equal under the law in North Carolina \u2014 a day that so many have fought so hard for , '' said the Rev . Jasmine Beach-Ferrara , executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality , after Friday 's ruling . `` We celebrate knowing that this shameful chapter in North Carolina 's history has passed .
