The GOP would have a menu of options to take on Hillary Clinton in 2020 : the hard-edged conservatism of Ted Cruz , the lofty oratory of Marco Rubio , the earnest wonkery of Paul Ryan or the brawny national security vision of Tom Cotton .\nInstead , the GOP \u2019 s crowded bench of 40-something upstarts will have to remain seated . Their short-term presidential hopes have been essentially extinguished by Donald Trump \u2019 s conquest of both the Republican Party and Clinton .\nAnd barring a first-term collapse of the first-time officeholder , it may be several White House election cycles before they have another shot . In the interim , waves of new GOP lawmakers will come to Congress to put their own stamp on the future of the party .\nFor now , the next generation of GOP leaders is left to implement the agenda of a man many of them opposed , to one degree or another , for the presidency .\n\u201c I would hope and I would believe that all of our senators , no matter what their future may hold , are more excited about the potential to get things done than they would be about any alternative , \u201d said Sen.
