    "content": "The arrest and jailing of a U.S. citizen in Allentown , Pa. , turned into a court case that complicates President Trump \u2019 s clampdown on \u2018 sanctuary cities . \u2019\nALLENTOWN , Pa.\u2014One of the chief strategies in President Donald Trump \u2019 s battle against illegal immigration is being undercut by an unlikely figure : a New Jersey native named Ernesto Galarza .\nIn 2008 , Mr. Galarza was doing construction work in this eastern Pennsylvania city when his boss allegedly sold drugs to an undercover police detective . Mr. Galarza was arrested along with the boss , and booked into the Lehigh County jail .\nMr. Galarza posted bond , but wasn \u2019 t released because a federal immigration agent had asked the jail to hold him . He sat behind bars three extra days before anyone realized he was a U.S. citizen .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union later won $ 95,000 from Lehigh County for violating Mr. Galarza \u2019 s constitutional rights , laying the groundwork for today \u2019 s high-profile battle between President Trump and what are often called \u201c sanctuary cities . \u201d\nThe Galarza case , and two similar ones that followed , signaled that counties will be held accountable in court if they wrongly imprison someone , and that acting at the request of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency isn \u2019 t a viable legal defense .\nMany cities and counties nationwide , including Lehigh , no longer hold people just because ICE asks . So while the president and his aides are at war with liberal enclaves like San Francisco and Chicago that declare themselves sanctuaries , they also are on a collision course with places like Lehigh County , a middle-class region where Republicans control the county commission .\nThis spring , the Trump administration published a list of nearly 140 cities and counties it believed were refusing to honor \u201c detainer \u201d requests ; 41 % of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 . On a separate list of noncompliant jurisdictions compiled by the Immigration Legal Resource Center , a pro-immigration advocacy group , 62 % of counties listed favored Mr. Trump .\nThe fight over sanctuary policies is playing out in courtrooms , Congress , statehouses and city councils . At least 36 states are considering legislation regarding such policies , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .\nIn recent months , the debates have unfolded in Nashville , Tenn. , Howard County , Md. , Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , Libertyville , Ill. , and other municipalities .\nA bill in California \u2019 s legislature would make the entire state a sanctuary , barring ICE officers from local jails unless they have a warrant . Texas , meantime , enacted legislation that compels counties to cooperate with ICE . The Texas debate was so heated that lawmakers broke into a brawl on the statehouse floor ; the law is being challenged in court .\nIn Washington , the House approved legislation last month that would deny federal grant funding for jurisdictions that don \u2019 t cooperate with ICE and offer legal protections for jails that do . And on Thursday , the Justice Department threatened to pull grant money from four cities , asserting its own authority .\nFew people had ever heard of the issue back in 2008 , when Mr. Galarza was arrested .\nBorn in 1974 in Perth Amboy , N.J. , he spent part of his childhood in Puerto Rico , where his family is from . At 21 , he moved to Allentown , a city of about 120,000 people some 60 miles north of Philadelphia .\nAllentown was made famous by the Billy Joel song chronicling the breakdown of the postwar American economic compact , but today it is home to a gentrifying downtown and a growing Latino population , which topped 42 % in 2010 .\nOn Thursday Nov. 20 , 2008 , Mr. Galarza was on a job , pulling up worn floorboards from a house , while his boss allegedly sold 14 grams of cocaine to an undercover Allentown police detective . The detective concluded Mr. Galarza was acting as a lookout and arrested him too .\nAfter posting bail , Mr. Galarza was on his way out of the county jail when an officer stopped him .\n\u201c I was about to go out the main door , and the main door was getting open and then it started closing , \u201d he said in an interview . \u201c I \u2019 m like what \u2019 s going , what \u2019 s going on ? They turned me back around . \u201d\nMr. Galarza had told the officer he was born in New Jersey but she didn \u2019 t believe it and reported him to ICE , according to court documents .\nAn ICE officer then filed a \u201c detainer \u201d instructing the jail to hold Mr. Galarza . He spent the weekend in the jail . On Monday , he was peppered with questions by ICE officers and finally released that night . By then , he had lost a part-time job and wages from two other jobs , court documents show . Five months later , he was acquitted of the drug charge .\nMore than a year later , the legal director of the ACLU in Pennsylvania , Witold Walczak , was passing through Allentown to give a speech and had lunch with a local attorney he knew .\nMr. Walczak asked the lawyer , David Viada , if he knew of any American citizens who had been wrongly held on an ICE detainer . Mr. Viada had represented Mr. Galarza in his drug trial and made the introduction .\nFor the ACLU , Mr. Galarza was an ideal plaintiff . The group wanted to challenge the Obama administration \u2019 s stepped-up use of detainers . \u201c We had come up with a legal framework , and we needed a plaintiff , \u201d said Mr. Walczak .\nIn November 2010 , the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on Mr. Galarza \u2019 s behalf against the Allentown detective , the ICE agents , the city of Allentown and Lehigh County . It alleged that Mr. Galarza \u2019 s constitutional rights were violated and noted that no probable cause to hold him had been established .\n\u201c This case is quite straightforward , \u201d attorney Jonathan H. Feinberg argued in court on Mr. Galarza \u2019 s behalf . \u201c Ernesto Galarza is a United States citizen . As a result of the actions of these defendants , he was held on an immigration detainer . That is wrong . \u201d\nAll four defendants moved to dismiss the case . The officers and the city lost and each settled out of court .\nThe judge let the county off the hook , but Mr. Galarza appealed to the Third U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals . Lehigh County , which operates the jail , defended itself by saying it was simply following orders from a federal agency .\nThat argument was undermined by statements from ICE that detainers were \u201c requests \u201d and compliance couldn \u2019 t be compelled .\nIn 2014 , the appellate court ruled , 2-1 , that the federal government had no right to require agencies to comply with detainers , under Supreme Court precedent preventing Washington from \u201c commandeering \u201d state and local agencies for federal purposes .\nLehigh County settled the case for $ 95,000 and by agreeing to a new policy whereby it no longer holds people because of an ICE request . The vote by the county commission was 9-0 .\nThe ACLU then wrote to officials in every Pennsylvania county , informing them of the Galarza opinion and urging them to follow Lehigh County \u2019 s lead .\nLehigh County officials also spread the word . Edward Sweeney , then-director of corrections for the county , wrote an essay in the trade journal Corrections Managers \u2019 Report , warning his colleagues of legal peril if they honored ICE detainers . He also made the point on an email distribution list used by jail officials .\nMr. Sweeney , a registered Republican , said in an interview he was happy to help ICE before the court ruling but not after : \u201c If the federal circuit court of appeals told me what I was doing was improper , you don \u2019 t have to hold a gun to my head to get me to make a change in policy . \u201d\nOther counties followed suit . A report from the Temple University law school found that by 2015 , about half of Pennsylvania counties had adopted policies of not routinely cooperating with ICE detainers .
