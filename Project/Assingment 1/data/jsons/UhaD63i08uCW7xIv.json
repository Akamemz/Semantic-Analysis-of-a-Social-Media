If they had their way , the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states .\nAnd Korn believes this plan has already been a success , pointing to the fact that Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50 % of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013 .\nKorn , who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House , said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County , New Jersey , a county Christie turned red in 2013 .\n`` This is a permanent , year round effort , '' Korn said . `` We will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote , but to build relationships and listen to their concerns . ''\nBut not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed . On the top of that list : the report 's suggestion that Republicans should `` embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform . ''\n`` If we do not , our party 's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only , '' wrote the five Republican authors of the report , which also stated that the RNC believes `` comprehensive immigration reform '' is `` consistent '' with Republican policies to `` promote job growth and opportunity for all . ''\nAfter passing the Senate , immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House . What 's more , Republican 's who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party 's base for that support .\nThe other much talked about suggestion , that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues , has proven hard to change .\n`` It 's not just what we say ; it 's how we say it , '' Priebus said when the report was published .\nBut a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort .\nExamples : When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have `` calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert '' or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said `` the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low . ''\nPriebus , who has called out some of the more outlandish comments , seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year .\n`` This idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world '' is not realistic , Preibus told CNN on Wednesday , the first day of the meeting . `` In one year , is the world carpeted ? No . But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny . ''\nEvery time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC , like it is doing this week , considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance , Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan .\nIn an e-mail on Tuesday , Marcy Stech , spokeswoman for Emily 's List , a liberal woman 's group , said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is `` misfiring on that rebrand '' and `` Republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason . ''\n`` This is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake , PR solution , '' Stech wrote . `` Maybe , in 2014 , they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want , and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they do n't . ''\nPriebus , quite expectedly , does n't see it that way . Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances , the chairman said the idea is that `` the point of the resolution is do n't stand there like s sitting duck , like a fool , and get punched in the face '' when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion .\nWhile tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes , the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012 .\nKirsten Kurkowski , the RNC 's spokeswoman , said the party has `` fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up , '' is `` closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology '' and has `` united behind the need for changes in the debate system . ''\nThe debate system as been an important , albeit quiet , focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss .\nFor much of 2013 , a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012 . Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week 's RNC meeting .\n`` I do n't think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party , '' Priebus said . `` I think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary . And like I said , look I ca n't always control people 's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. ``\nAs for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take , most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable .\n`` We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say , but we do n't have a magic wand , '' said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour . `` I think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight . We have to keep educating our members , or governors , as well as our candidates , to think about what you say and how you say it .
