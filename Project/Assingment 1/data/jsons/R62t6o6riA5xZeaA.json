Devin Nunes ( R-CA ) , that has become a key part of the conservative argument that the FBI is biased against President Donald Trump . The Democrats \u2019 rebuttal memo , written by Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , argues that the Nunes memo is full of \u201c distortions and misrepresentations \u201d that don \u2019 t stand up to scrutiny based on the underlying classified evidence .\nHaving now read both memos , I can say with confidence : Schiff makes his case . He quotes key FBI documents that explicitly contradict the Nunes memo \u2019 s core arguments . Any fair-minded observer who reads these two documents side by side can only conclude one thing : Nunes is either deeply misinformed or straight-up lying .\n\u201c This is a pretty thorough demolition , \u201d Julian Sanchez , an expert on surveillance at the libertarian Cato Institute , tweeted after reading Schiff \u2019 s memo .\nThe Nunes memo \u2019 s core allegation is that the FBI and Department of Justice misled at least one federal judge on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court during the Trump-Russia investigation .\nIn October 2016 , the FBI requested a FISA warrant to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page . FBI and DOJ officials argued that Page had troubling connections to the Kremlin , and wanted to check him out as part of their overall investigation into the Trump campaign \u2019 s ties to Russia .\nAn \u201c essential part \u201d of the application , Nunes argues , came from the so-called Steele dossier \u2014 the document containing major allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia that was put together by former British spy Christopher Steele ( it \u2019 s also the source of the \u201c pee tape \u201d rumors ) . The problem , Nunes argues , is that Steele \u2019 s research was partially funded by Democrats \u2014 but the FBI purposely neglected to tell the court about that source of funding .\nIn essence , Nunes alleges that the FBI used opposition research put together by a Democratic political operative to go after the Trump campaign without disclosing that clear conflict of interest to the court . This was , according to Nunes , \u201c a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process . \u201d\nThe Schiff memo argues that this isn \u2019 t true . And it has the receipts to prove it .\nSchiff quotes a lengthy passage from the actual application the FBI sent to the FISA court asking for permission to snoop on Page . In the key line , the application explicitly notes that \u201c the FBI speculates \u201d that Steele had been hired to find \u201c information that could be used to discredit Candidate # 1 \u2019 s [ Trump \u2019 s ] campaign . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s it . That \u2019 s the ballgame . The FBI clearly states right there in the FISA application that they believe Steele was hired to find dirt on Trump . Since the core contention of the Nunes memo is that the FBI didn \u2019 t do that , Nunes \u2019 s entire argument falls apart .\nAfter the Schiff memo was released on Saturday , House Republicans released a document rebutting its core claims . Their response to this damning citation is \u2014 and I am not making this up \u2014 that the vital line in which the FBI discloses the information about Steele was \u201c buried in a footnote . \u201d\n\u201c This is clearly an attempt to avoid informing the Court , in a straightforward manner that the DNC and Clinton campaign paid for the dossier , \u201d the Republican rebuttal argues .\nIt \u2019 s true that it was in a footnote . But that \u2019 s about as far as it goes .\nAt this point , it \u2019 s unclear whether the FBI did in fact know who specifically was funding Steele \u2019 s work , or that it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign . But regardless , the FBI clearly told the judge that some of the information it was using to justify the FISA warrant request came from a partisan source . And the judge \u2014 who presumably read the footnotes \u2014 decided it was compelling enough to approve the application anyway . Case closed .\nThe Schiff memo tears apart Nunes \u2019 s argument in other ways too\nThere \u2019 s more in the Schiff memo that \u2019 s important than just that one devastating point .\nThe conceptual problem with Nunes \u2019 s argument , as opposed to the factual one , is that it doesn \u2019 t really matter if Steele was biased . The FBI relies on sources with axes to grind all the time ; people typically don \u2019 t go to the authorities with damaging information about people they like .\nThe key question in an application like this isn \u2019 t whether the source liked the target ; it \u2019 s whether the specific claims they \u2019 re making are credible . And the Schiff memo points out that the FBI had independent reasons to believe that Steele \u2019 s arguments were credible .\nFor one thing , Page had been on the bureau \u2019 s radar for some time \u2014 as he had been approached by Russian spies in the past as a potential intelligence asset . According to Schiff , the October FISA application laid out Page \u2019 s connections to the Kremlin \u201c in detail. \u201d For instance , while Page was working for Trump , in July 2016 , he traveled to Moscow to give a commencement speech at a Russian university , which certainly would have raised some red flags at the bureau .\nThe Steele dossier , per Schiff , was used as supporting evidence to further establish that this trip was sketchy . Specifically , Steele \u2019 s sources said that Page met with two Russians close to Putin during his trip ( which Page insists didn \u2019 t happen ) .\nBut then something interesting happened . After the FISA warrant was approved , Schiff writes , \u201c [ the ] DOJ provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele \u2019 s reporting. \u201d The precise nature of those sources is included in the Schiff memo , but it \u2019 s redacted in the public copy , to the point where it \u2019 s not even clear which specific Steele claims have been vindicated .\nNonetheless , it \u2019 s incredibly important . It suggests that Steele \u2019 s information was borne out by the FBI \u2019 s own work . Citing him wasn \u2019 t some kind of intelligence malpractice , or anti-Trump bias , but rather the result of a source who has a track record of providing relevant , correct intelligence .\nThis is perhaps why the FISA warrant , which has to be renewed every 90 days by law , was renewed three subsequent times \u2014 all by judges appointed by Republican presidents .\nSo how did Nunes get this so wrong ? A February interview he did with Fox News provides a bit of a clue . In it , host Bret Baier asks Nunes if he read the October 2016 FISA warrant that figures so prominently in his explosive memo .",
