''\nThe loyalty of the president 's base \u2014 voters who tend to be older , socially conservative and mostly white \u2014 has been a critical source of his political strength . Trump continues to hammer messages that appeal to them on such issues as limiting immigration and reversing Pentagon policy on transgender troops .\nThat said , the spiderweb of concern among his supporters in these interviews is an anecdotal finding consistent with the results of recent nationwide polls . A CNN survey at the six-month mark of Trump 's presidency last week showed his approval rating among Republicans at a healthy 83 % , but the percentage of Republicans who `` strongly approve '' had dropped by double-digits , to 59 % from 73 % in February .\nNone of the 25 voters on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 panel express regret for casting a ballot last November for Trump instead of Democrat Hillary Clinton or someone else .

Asked if Trump was doing better or worse than he expected as president , he said : `` I do n't know what I expected . I just did n't want Hillary in there . ''\nThere 's also bit less confidence these days about how history will judge Trump . In January , 21 members of the panel predicted he ultimately would be seen as a `` great '' or `` good '' president . In February , there was even more unanimity : 23 gave that positive assessment .\nNow that number has slipped to 19 \u2014 still favorable territory , but with signs of some erosion .

The group of 18 men and seven women , ranging in age from 31 to 88 , agreed to weigh in occasionally for a look at how Trump is faring with his supporters .\nThe GOP 's failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act has enraged some of these voters .\n`` Killing Obamacare was a key component of the Republican platform , and I believe all Republican senators campaigned on that very issue , '' Daniel Kohn , of Corpus Christi , Tex. , said . `` The inability to move forward is embarrassing and disgusting .
