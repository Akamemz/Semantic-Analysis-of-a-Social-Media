While 21 states have laws that bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , Democrats in Congress and running for president are pushing for a federal statute that would provide broader protections .\nBut that more sweeping bill \u2019 s chances of passage are low unless Democrats take back full control of Congress as well as the White House , given President Donald Trump \u2019 s opposition and Republican critics who warn of a risk to religious freedom . That prospect has informed Stewart and outside groups \u2019 work on a proposal to enshrine rights for the LGBTQ community while also preserving the right for religious groups to act in accordance with their faiths .\nAmong other faith-based exemptions to anti-discrimination protections in the bill is an allowance for religious groups such as churches and schools to employ those who align with their internal guidelines , according to a summary provided in advance of its release . The bill also would prohibit religious groups that oppose same-sex marriage from having their tax-exempt status revoked .\n\u201c We have taken back the religious liberty principle from extremists who I think do want to do harm to LGBTQ people and minority rights , \u201d said Tyler Deaton , a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund , a nonprofit supporting Stewart \u2019 s bill that seeks to build conservative support for LGBTQ rights . Deaton added that some religious conservative groups who were consulted on the bill ultimately chose not to endorse it .\nDespite that resistance from some on the right , Stewart \u2019 s bill sparked sharp criticism from progressives who decry its exemptions as large enough to enable ongoing mistreatment of LGBTQ individuals .\n\u201c We need to address the real and pervasive problem that is discrimination against LGBTQ people , and everyone should come to the table to address the problem , \u201d said Laura Durso , a vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress . \u201c But what we can not do is treat LGBTQ people as second-class citizens by creating carve-outs that enable discrimination . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation .
