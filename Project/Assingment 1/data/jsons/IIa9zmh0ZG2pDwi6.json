    "content": "One thing this past weekend 's horrors in Charlottesville showed us is that that concerns about polarization and divisiveness can sometimes be a dodge from the real problems .\nI want to be as clear as possible that political and partisan polarization is a real thing . Political scientists and journalists have collected decades of evidence , from a great many sources , that the parties are farther apart ideologically than they 've been in a century\u2014or possibly ever . Differences between Republicans and Democrats are reinforced by divisions between conservatives and liberals , between rural and urban citizens , between whites and non-whites , between southerners and northerners , etc. , as new issues and divisions get absorbed into the party divide .\nSuch polarization is not inherently unhealthy for a country , and it even serves some positive purposes . The fact that voters actually have a choice in elections between two very different visions , and that they know they 'll get something different from the status quo if they change leaders , is a good thing . It means elections have consequences and voters have some sense of what those consequences are . This has not always been true in our history .\nAnd for the most part , those divisions reflect alliances of sincere policy preferences across the country . There 's no objectively correct level of taxation or business regulation , no obviously right answer to how easy it should be to obtain a handgun or a pack of cigarettes . And the country is a large and very diverse one , so there 's no reason to expect leaders to just come together and figure out the right answer . So people get together in teams and argue it out in elections and legislatures .\nAnd yes , this polarization does make governing harder . It means some problems go unaddressed . It means that , when compromises are finally hashed out , no one really likes them . There 's no easy way around it . But we can accept that there are different sides arguing sincerely and legitimately for their vision of good government and a healthy society .\nThis is not the division we saw in Charlottesville . On one side of the divide were people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags , carrying torches and holding their arms in a Nazi salute , proudly and openly boasting of the supremacy of the white race . On the other side were people opposed to that vision . One of the white supremacists drove his car into a group of the counter-protesters , killing one of them and seriously injuring many more .\nThis should be an easy call . When Nazis march on an American city and attack and kill people , it 's very apparent what the problem is .\nAnd many politicians spoke up to decry what they were seeing unfold . But some chose to recast the problem as one of polarization or divisiveness . President Donald Trump , of course , criticized the violence and hatred `` on many sides '' and urged the nation to come together . His daughter Ivanka said that `` We must all come together as Americans\u2014and be one country UNITED . '' Vice President Mike Pence echoed the president 's statements and said that the `` U.S is greatest when we join together & oppose those seeking to divide us . '' Sheriff David Clarke praised Trump for condemning violence and not taking sides .\nWhen violent white supremacists attack and kill people , criticizing divisiveness and urging people to unite is , at best , a dodge . At worst , it 's telling victims of violence and terror that they should make more of an effort to reach out to their attackers . If the sides are Nazis and non-Nazis , we should welcome divisiveness and polarization .\nReading some of these responses , I was reminded of last year 's story about an older white man , John McGraw , who attended a 2016 Trump rally in Fayetteville , North Carolina , and assaulted a younger African-American man , Rakeem Lamar Jones , who was there protesting Trump . McGraw was arrested and received one year of probation . McGraw apologized for hitting Jones , but McGraw 's statement following the apology was notable :\nYou know what you did . And I know what I did . I 'm not going to say you were wrong or I was wrong . You and I both know what occurred , and I hate it worse than anything else in the world . We got caught up in a political mess today . And you and me , we got to heal our country .\nIf someone attacks someone else , the problem is not that there 's a `` political mess , '' and the solution is not that both of them need to `` heal our country . '' In this case , divisiveness was the scapegoat . It was a way for McGraw to avoid moral responsibility for his actions .\nNow , where 's the line between legitimate polarization\u2014where both sides ' views should be given equal standing\u2014and the kind of division where leaders should take a clear stance for one side and against the other ? That 's obviously a judgment call . But if one side is wearing a swastika , it should n't be a hard one .",
