On Friday , the Times published another piece about Biden that referred to him as a \u201c wounded leading candidate \u201d \u2014accompanied by a graph that showed Biden not only rising a bit in the national polling average but still ahead of his standing after a deeper dip in the polls , four months ago , than his recent slide .\nContestable claims about political candidates and speculation about elections obviously have a place in our discourse .
