    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : The kickoff to the 2020 campaign was undercut on Monday night by major delays in the reporting of the results from the Iowa caucuses . The story of the day . It \u2019 s Tuesday , February 4 .\nExactly . So let \u2019 s just set the scene a little bit . It \u2019 s 4 p.m. We \u2019 re in Des Moines . In about 2.5 Iowans are going to start heading to these caucus locations around the state . We \u2019 re going to do the same . And I want to talk with you about how this is going to work . So can you just give me a quick primer on this very particular tool of American democracy , the caucus ?\nWell , calling it a tool of democracy is generous in the view of some people . It is not a secret ballot . This is not something where people take 10 minutes in the middle of their workday , go vote and then return to their desk . This is an in-person , out in the open exercise of demonstrating your public support for a candidate . The way this works \u2014 literally , physically , in practice \u2014 is there are hundreds of predesignated caucus locations around the state . And around 7 p.m. local , people show up at these locations , and they \u2019 re asked to gather themselves into groups according to which candidate they \u2019 re supporting . They do that . There is an assessment made about which candidate has 15 percent of the support in the room and which candidates do not hit that threshold of support . So when people refer to the threshold , that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re talking about \u2014 15 percent support at the caucus site .\nOf everybody in the room \u2014 15 percent of everybody who has showed up .\nThat \u2019 s right . If you haven \u2019 t hit that 15 percent threshold , your candidate does not qualify to get delegates . And then the voting goes to a second round , where you get to reallocate yourselves to candidates who did hit the 15 percent threshold . So if you go in there expecting to caucus for Alex Burns , and Alex Burns in the first round only has 9 percent of the people in the room supporting him \u2014\nEntirely possible . He \u2019 s not super popular in Iowa . You can reallocate your support to somebody else in the room , perhaps Michael Barbaro , who just barely cleared the threshold at 16.5 percent .\nSo what might be the impact of this process on the field of 2020 Democratic candidates and what we know about those dynamics ? I \u2019 m thinking about Bernie Sanders , for example , who has been polling in the lead and who we understand has benefited from more moderate Iowans splitting their support among the other leading candidates in the race .\nWell what the Sanders campaign believes will certainly be good for him , or almost certainly be good for him , is having that first-round popular vote ultimately released to the public . They believe that however the reallocation process ultimately sorts itself out , that he is very , very likely to have the most support on that first round of caucusing . So that even if he ends up slipping behind somebody else , they will be able to brandish that as a symbolic victory .\nWhich is another way of saying he predicts he might lose some support through the process as it goes along .\nExactly . And for the more moderate candidates , those candidates have been competing for a lot of the same indecisive voters who are trying to sort out which of these candidates is the best bet against Trump , but I \u2019 m not for Bernie Sanders . Right ? So if you are a moderate woman in the suburbs of Des Moines and you are tempted by three or four of these candidates , you may very well have the chance to vote for one and then change your mind in the second round . And it \u2019 s really anyone \u2019 s guess right now as to whether you are going to see more moderates moving towards Joe Biden on the second round , or women moving towards Elizabeth Warren on the second round , or perhaps Pete Buttigieg supporters scattering across the field . It is wildly unpredictable . And because of the way that 15 percent threshold works , it is hugely important whether somebody in the first round is at 16 percent or at 14 percent . Not only because whether they hit the threshold for themselves , but because it will determine whose supporters are actually deciding what happens on the second round . And in a caucus site where Elizabeth Warren is at 16 percent , her people are locked in . In a site where she \u2019 s at 14 percent , that \u2019 s a place where suddenly Bernie Sanders is in a position to pick up all the support from liberals who preferred Elizabeth Warren but might consider him on the second round .\nRight . Right . But if Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s at 16 percent , Bernie Sanders can \u2019 t go after any of her supporters because they \u2019 re locked in .\nRight . So if you are Pete Buttigieg or Joe Biden , you are looking at the other guy and really hoping he doesn \u2019 t clear 15 percent in a lot of places . Because you \u2019 re betting that most of those voters are moderates and are likelier to go to me \u2014 by a lot \u2014 than they are to go to Bernie . But if both Biden and Buttigieg mostly end up at 16 or 17 percent , then they could find themselves sort of persistently stuck behind Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren .\nSo what should we be most on the lookout for as we head out to these caucuses ?\nA lot of voters here are not necessarily going to make up their mind based on the ideological factors that we perceive as the national media looking at these candidates from afar . There can be a real sort of oversimplification for the way we see the lanes in this race that we think that somebody who is an Elizabeth Warren supporter is more likely to go to Bernie Sanders than to Joe Biden , as I just said . But it may be that somebody is an Elizabeth Warren supporter , not because they are left populist ideologically , but because they like her experience and they saw her in television ads with Barack Obama and they liked that .\nSo they could easily go to Pete Buttigieg , not Bernie Sanders .\nRight , or to Joe Biden or anybody else , right ? That if you \u2019 re a Klobuchar voter , I think we in the national media tend to think of her as a centrist candidate , and by and large she is . She \u2019 s also the only other woman with a real shot at clearing the 15 percent threshold in this process . And if you \u2019 re for Amy Klobuchar , not just because she \u2019 s a centrist , but because you feel like it \u2019 s important to elect a woman president , you might end up moving to the ideological left on a second round just because Elizabeth Warren is the option available to you .\nI \u2019 m saying that anybody who is gaming this out in advance , with ideology as the sole or defining characteristic of how these voters make up their minds , is really risking missing the way real people are going to experience this .\nSo we will talk to you four hours \u2014 five hours ?\nPrepare yourself for some extremely unpleasantly cold weather . O.K . I don \u2019 t know \u2014 oh actually that \u2019 s Reid .\nThank you for being our chauffeur . I feel like my dad \u2019 s taking us all to the soccer game .\nNo , but this is like the last day , so this is the song that \u2014\nSo this is the idea of the song , is like one day more .\n\u201c One day more . Watch them run amuck . Catch them as they fall . Never know your luck when there \u2019 s a free for all . We \u2019 ll be ready for these school boys . Tomorrow we \u2019 ll be far away . Tomorrow is the judgement day . \u201d\n( SINGING ALONG ) \u201c Tomorrow we \u2019 ll discover what our God in heaven has in store . One day more ! \u201d\nSo we \u2019 re pulling into Johnston Middle School , and the parking lot is getting pretty \u2014\n\u2014 pretty full . I \u2019 d say there \u2019 s a couple \u2014 maybe 150 cars here .\nWe \u2019 re asking you to stay right in this area here .\nT \u2019 s over there and see if you \u2019 re on the \u2014\nO.K . It \u2019 s 6 o \u2019 clock and the doors have just opened .\nPrecinct One is on this side . Precinct Two on this side .\nWe are now in a very crowded main hallway of the school , and I think they \u2019 re going to go register .\nYou know each other ? Do a lot of people know each other ?\nWhich is , I believe , a gymnasium . I \u2019 m just \u2014 I \u2019 m having flashbacks to high school . So now we \u2019 re in the gymnasium . There \u2019 s a huge set of bleachers in the back , and that is where the candidate alignment is going to begin . There are signs for Bernie , and people are sitting on those bleachers . There are signs for Pete , people are sitting on those bleachers . Warren , Klobuchar , Yang .\nThe sign-in is practically done and it \u2019 s 7 o \u2019 clock . So how about that ? [ APPLAUSE ]\n( WHISPERING ) It \u2019 s Tom Leffler . He \u2019 s the precinct chairman . He \u2019 s running the caucus .\nIt is so great to see all of you here . So my story , just so you know , I am from Minnesota . I am a granddaughter of an iron ore miner . I \u2019 m the daughter \u2014\n( WHISPERING ) Why is Klobuchar here , and why is she allowed to be here ?\n( WHISPERING ) And what \u2019 s the point of her showing up at the last minute right before the caucus ?\nBecause this is really the time when she has to convince undecided caucus goers to come for her . And more important , people who their candidates might not be viable on the second alignment , to get them to come to her on a realignment . Iowans love people to show up , and she \u2019 s literally shown up at the caucus .\n\u2014 what unites all of you in your separate groups is bigger than what divides us . I would love to have your support , but I also want us to win big in the general election . Let \u2019 s do it . Thank you , everybody . Thank you . [ APPLAUSE ]\nDo you know what \u2019 s happening right now ? Is now the time you vote ?\n\u2014 they told us we had a total of 358 people here to caucus , registered voters . We have to have 15 percent to be viable . Well , that figures out to 54 is a count that you have to have to be viable .\nSo I was going to ask , does it look like anyone \u2019 s in , at this moment , in danger of not being viable , and who isn \u2019 t ?\nWell the Yang group is probably not going to be viable . Doesn \u2019 t look they have 54 people over there . Biden \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t look like Biden is going to be viable here .\nSo Biden and Yang may not make 15 percent \u2014\n( WHISPERING ) Are you surprised that Biden doesn \u2019 t seem viable at the moment ?\nWell , what happens happens , but I think that \u2019 s a mistake . I can \u2019 t understand the lack of support . Of course , my wife \u2019 s supporting somebody else .\nSo if you don \u2019 t become viable , where do you think you \u2019 re going to go next ?\nHow are you guys doing ? We \u2019 re from \u201c The Daily \u201d with The New York Times . How \u2019 s your vote count ?\nWe \u2019 re about 20 short to viability . We \u2019 re also looking at a very small Biden crowd and hoping we can pop over there . I don \u2019 t know how \u2014\nSo you want to convert them to Yang ? You think \u2014\nMy hunch is the Yang is probably more of a group of true believers , versus hoping just for the most electable candidate . So we \u2019 ll find out .\nThe Yang people are now heading over to the Biden people to do some business . Do you want to \u2014\nOver here , we \u2019 d be willing to tell you why he \u2019 s a good candidate .\nFor me , I really like Yang . I really want to see him in the government . He needs to be in the government . I don \u2019 t see him as president quite yet . He \u2019 s still young . He \u2019 s got a lot to do , but we need him in the government now . And I think that \u2014\nCabinet member or something , and so he will be there . Let me tell you why I think Joe , and we would love to have Joe \u2014\nNo , we \u2019 re not going to go Joe because he caucused when I was 24 \u2014 his first election . 1988 .\nNo he \u2019 s not . He just almost got impeached , or caused our whole country to fall apart with the impeachment . And his son \u2014 he got his son that job for $ 50,000 a year . That \u2019 s crooked . 100 percent . And that \u2019 s going to come up during the election . If you don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s not going to come up when he runs against Trump \u2014\nHis son \u2014 yes , his son \u2014 his son has not done anything for that money . His son has not done anything for that money .\nYeah I \u2019 m sorry . I know , it didn \u2019 t work very well , did it ? It fell flat on its face , so I \u2019 ll go back .\nO.K. ? Well yeah , because I \u2019 m hot . But not that kind of hot .\nDid that feel like a winning argument from the Yang people to you ?\nNo , but are you going to go somewhere else if he \u2019 s not viable ?\nIf he is not viable , Amy would be my second choice .\nWill you try to convince your group to go to Amy ?\nI don \u2019 t know what I \u2019 ll do . I \u2019 ll have to think about that . I have to think about that because I \u2014 but Amy would be my second choice .\nFinal results are being read now for the first allocation .\nO.K. , this is Pete . Pete Buttigieg has 70 . Viable . [ APPLAUSE ] Viable . Warren has 59 . Viable . [ APPLAUSE ] Klobuchar has 75 . [ APPLAUSE ] Viable .\nSo at 8 o \u2019 clock , here is the count from the first round , the first allocation as it \u2019 s called : Sanders has 76 . Klobuchar has 75 . Buttigieg has 70 . Warren has 59 . Biden has 37 , is not viable . Yang has 33 , is not viable . Steyer has four , not viable . Gabbard has three , not viable . And there are now 77 votes among the nonviable candidates that will be redistributed in the coming minutes , and that could obviously \u2014 given the spread between the top candidates \u2014 completely change everything . Of course , some voters may just walk out because dinner \u2019 s at home getting cold or because they don \u2019 t believe in any of the other candidates .\nIf you want your voice to be heard , join us . Join team Bernie .\nI think we \u2019 re going to go \u2014 I \u2019 m going to go with Amy . Amy Klobuchar .",

I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m having flashbacks to high school. So now we\u2019re in the gymnasium. There\u2019s a huge set of bleachers in the back, and that is where the candidate alignment is going to begin. There are signs for Bernie, and people are sitting on those bleachers. There are signs for Pete, people are sitting on those bleachers. Warren, Klobuchar, Yang.\n\ntom leffler\n\nThe sign-in is practically done and it\u2019s 7 o\u2019clock. So how about that? [APPLAUSE]\n\nreid epstein\n\n(WHISPERING) It\u2019s Tom Leffler. He\u2019s the precinct chairman. He\u2019s running the caucus.\n\ntom leffler\n\n\u2014 in the vicinity.\n\nspeaker\n\nTesting, testing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n(WHISPERING) Amy Klobuchar is outside.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nIs she allowed in?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah.\n\nspeaker\n\nAll right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAmy Klobuchar has just walked into the room.\n\n[applause]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDramatic entrance.\n\namy klobuchar\n\nIt is so great to see all of you here. So my story, just so you know, I am from Minnesota. I am a granddaughter of an iron ore miner. I\u2019m the daughter \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n(WHISPERING) Why is Klobuchar here, and why is she allowed to be here?\n\nreid epstein\n\nAny candidate who shows up can speak.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n(WHISPERING) And what\u2019s the point of her showing up at the last minute right before the caucus?\n\nreid epstein\n\nBecause this is really the time when she has to convince undecided caucus goers to come for her. And more important, people who their candidates might not be viable on the second alignment, to get them to come to her on a realignment. Iowans love people to show up, and she\u2019s literally shown up at the caucus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a really dramatic gesture.\n\namy klobuchar\n\n\u2014 what unites all of you in your separate groups is bigger than what divides us. I would love to have your support, but I also want us to win big in the general election. Let\u2019s do it. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]\n\n[indistinct speech]\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nDo you know what\u2019s happening right now?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nExcuse me?\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nDo you know what\u2019s happening right now? Is now the time you vote?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nYeah see what we\u2019re doing is \u2014\n\nspeaker 2\n\nI don\u2019t think we have to.\n\nspeaker 1\n\n\u2014 they told us we had a total of 358 people here to caucus, registered voters. We have to have 15 percent to be viable. Well, that figures out to 54 is a count that you have to have to be viable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I was going to ask, does it look like anyone\u2019s in, at this moment, in danger of not being viable, and who isn\u2019t?\n\nreid epstein\n\nWell the Yang group is probably not going to be viable. Doesn\u2019t look they have 54 people over there. Biden \u2014 it doesn\u2019t look like Biden is going to be viable here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Biden and Yang may not make 15 percent \u2014\n\nreid epstein\n\nMay not make \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n\u2014 may not have 54 people.\n\nreid epstein\n\nRight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n(WHISPERING) Are you surprised that Biden doesn\u2019t seem viable at the moment?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nVery surprised.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAre you upset?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nWell, what happens happens, but I think that\u2019s a mistake. I can\u2019t understand the lack of support. Of course, my wife\u2019s supporting somebody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWho is your wife supporting?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nWarren.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K.\n\nspeaker 1\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if you don\u2019t become viable, where do you think you\u2019re going to go next?\n\nspeaker 1\n\nWarren.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nO.K.\n\nspeaker 1\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll see you over there.\n\nspeaker 1\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n(WHISPERING) Are you guys the Yang gang?\n\nspeaker 2\n\n(WHISPERING) Yes we are.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow are you guys doing? We\u2019re from \u201cThe Daily\u201d with The New York Times. How\u2019s your vote count?\n\nspeaker 2\n\nWe\u2019re about 20 short to viability. We\u2019re also looking at a very small Biden crowd and hoping we can pop over there. I don\u2019t know how \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd then maybe negotiate?\n\nspeaker 2\n\nWe\u2019re hoping. That\u2019s my hope.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nSo you want to convert them to Yang? You think \u2014\n\nspeaker 2\n\nMy hunch is the Yang is probably more of a group of true believers, versus hoping just for the most electable candidate. So we\u2019ll find out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Yang people are now heading over to the Biden people to do some business. Do you want to \u2014\n\nspeaker 3\n\nOver here, we\u2019d be willing to tell you why he\u2019s a good candidate.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nFor me, I really like Yang. I really want to see him in the government. He needs to be in the government. I don\u2019t see him as president quite yet. He\u2019s still young. He\u2019s got a lot to do, but we need him in the government now. And I think that \u2014\n\nspeaker 3\n\nI would agree, cabinet member at least.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nCabinet member or something, and so he will be there. Let me tell you why I think Joe, and we would love to have Joe \u2014\n\nspeaker 3\n\nNo, we\u2019re not going to go Joe because he caucused when I was 24 \u2014 his first election. 1988.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nHe is solid as a rock.\n\nspeaker 3\n\nNo he\u2019s not. He just almost got impeached, or caused our whole country to fall apart with the impeachment. And his son \u2014 he got his son that job for $50,000 a year. That\u2019s crooked. 100 percent. And that\u2019s going to come up during the election. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s not going to come up when he runs against Trump \u2014\n\nspeaker 4\n\nHave you fact checked that?\n\nspeaker 3\n\nYes, I have. Yes.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nHave you fact checked the whole thing \u2014\n\nspeaker 3\n\nYes, I have.\n\nspeaker 4\n\n\u2014 and about the legitimacy of it?\n\nspeaker 3\n\nHis son \u2014 yes, his son \u2014 his son has not done anything for that money. His son has not done anything for that money.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this is your overture to the Biden people?\n\nspeaker 3\n\nYeah I\u2019m sorry. I know, it didn\u2019t work very well, did it? It fell flat on its face, so I\u2019ll go back.\n\nspeaker 5\n\nGod, these people scare me.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nThat amazes me. I\u2019m so sorry about that.\n\nsam dolnick\n\nYou didn\u2019t seem swayed.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nWhat?\n\nsam dolnick\n\nYou didn\u2019t seem swayed.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nI\u2019m not swayed.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nAre you angry?\n\nspeaker 4\n\nNo I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m disappointed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour face is a little red.\n\nspeaker 4\n\nO.K.? Well yeah, because I\u2019m hot. But not that kind of hot.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDid that feel like a winning argument from the Yang people to you?\n\nspeaker 4\n\nNo, not to me.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nDo you know where you might go?\n\nspeaker 4\n\nBiden.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nNo, but are you going to go somewhere else if he\u2019s not viable?\n\nspeaker 4\n\nIf he is not viable, Amy would be my second choice.\n\nclare toeniskoetter\n\nWill you try to convince your group to go to Amy?\n\nspeaker 4\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll have to think about that. I have to think about that because I \u2014 but Amy would be my second choice.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinal results are being read now for the first allocation.\n\nspeaker 1\n\nBiden has 37. 37 will not be viable.\n\nspeaker 2\n\nYou can come over here.\n\nemcee\n\nO.K., this is Pete. Pete Buttigieg has 70. Viable. [APPLAUSE] Viable. Warren has 59. Viable. [APPLAUSE] Klobuchar has 75. [APPLAUSE] Viable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at 8 o\u2019clock, here is the count from the first round, the first allocation as it\u2019s called: Sanders has 76. Klobuchar has 75. Buttigieg has 70. Warren has 59. Biden has 37, is not viable. Yang has 33, is not viable. Steyer has four, not viable. Gabbard has three, not viable. And there are now 77 votes among the nonviable candidates that will be redistributed in the coming minutes, and that could obviously \u2014 given the spread between the top candidates \u2014 completely change everything. Of course, some voters may just walk out because dinner\u2019s at home getting cold or because they don\u2019t believe in any of the other candidates.\n\nspeaker 1\n\nIf you want your voice to be heard, join us. Join team Bernie.\n\nspeaker 2\n\nI think we\u2019re going to go \u2014 I\u2019m going to go with Amy. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nmichael barbaro",
