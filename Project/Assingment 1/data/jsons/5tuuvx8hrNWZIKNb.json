    "content_original": "The Hill, the newspaper that covers Congress, says this year, there will be a major policy battle over \"climate change.\" Why?\n\nWe already waste billions on pointless gestures that make people think we're addressing global warming, but the earth doesn't notice or care. What exactly is \"global warming\" anyway?\n\nThat's really four questions:\n\n1. Is the globe warming? Probably. Global temperatures have risen. Climate changes. Always has. Always will.\n\n2. Is the warming caused by man? Maybe. There's decent evidence that at least some of it is.\n\n[pullquote]\n\n3. But is global warming a crisis? Far from it. It's possible that it will become a crisis. Some computer models suggest big problems, but the models aren't very accurate. Some turned out to be utterly wrong. Clueless scaremongers like Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Cal., seize on weather disasters to blame man's carbon output.
