And while technically under immigration law Melania \u2019 s citizenship could be revoked if the government found she \u2019 d committed visa fraud to come here , it \u2019 s extremely unlikely that that \u2019 s going to happen .\nImmigration policy is extremely complicated ; the line between \u201c legal \u201d and \u201c illegal \u201d isn \u2019 t always visible . Melania appears to have entered the US legally and then worked illegally . If anything , that should give pause to anyone who believes her husband and other politicians who claim that unauthorized immigration can be remedied by building a wall at the border , or fixed easily at all .\nMelania Trump came to the US in the mid-1990s to work as a model . But the specifics of her arrival , and the specific immigration status she had before getting a green card in 2001 , were always unclear \u2014 and have provoked a great deal of speculation about whether she was really a \u201c legal immigrant \u201d for the entire time she lived in the US .\nThe AP \u2019 s reporting doesn \u2019 t answer all the questions that have been raised about Melania \u2019 s immigration status , including how she got her green card in 2001 . But it does establish a clear timeline for how she came to the US to begin with . ( Lawyers affiliated with the Trumps dispute the AP article , saying its documents don \u2019 t \u201c reflect our records \u201d \u2014 but the Trumps have never released any documents related to Melania \u2019 s status themselves . )\nAccording to the AP , Melania Knauss ( her maiden name ) first came to the US in August 1996 on a B1/B2 \u201c tourist visa. \u201d Tourist visas allow someone to stay in the US for six months , but they can \u2019 t seek employment in the US during that time .\nThen on October 18 , 1996 , the AP found , she got an H-1B visa for \u201c skilled workers \u201d allowing her to work legally in the US as a model .\nThe problem is that the AP \u2019 s documentation shows that Melania was \u201c paid for 10 modeling assignments between September 10 and October 15 \u201d \u2014 while she was still on the tourist visa . In other words , she was working on a visa that didn \u2019 t legally permit her to work \u2014 and thus was violating the terms by which she \u2019 d been allowed to come to the US .\nMelania could have committed visa fraud \u2014 or she could have been duped by unscrupulous employers\nTo be clear : Melania Knauss didn \u2019 t enter the US illegally .

It \u2019 s for people who are going to professional conferences , for example , or networking with associates \u2014 or even negotiating a contract for future employment . The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website explains that activities under a business visitor visa \u201c must be directly connected with and part of your work abroad . \u201d\nLegally , working for pay for a US company is a clear violation of the terms of that visa , but it \u2019 s not exactly intuitive that someone coming on a business visa , especially if she \u2019 d been working as a model in Europe , wouldn \u2019 t be allowed to work .\nThis summer , when questions about Melania \u2019 s immigration status first came up , a Politico article cited a labor standards advocacy group \u2019 s claim that \u201c [ i ] t was a common practice in the 1990s in New York for less scrupulous agencies to bring in foreign models to work illegally on temporary business and tourist visas. \u201d If Melania Trump was on the same sort of visa as everyone else she worked with , it \u2019 s totally possible that she was simply being misled as to its legality .\nThen again , it is also entirely possible that Melania knowingly committed visa fraud ; that , in fact , she lied to US immigration officials when entering the country in August 1996 about her intentions to work while in the US . That \u2019 s not just an immigration violation but an outright federal crime .\nEither way , in order for Melania to have gotten a green card and then US citizenship , she would have had to attest that she hadn \u2019 t violated immigration law before \u2014 something that now appears to be untrue .\nIf the US government really wanted to , it could use the AP \u2019 s reporting to launch an investigation into whether Melania Trump deliberately misrepresented her immigration history when she sought US citizenship .
