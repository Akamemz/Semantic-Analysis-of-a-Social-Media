    "content": "( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - Some members of Saudi Arabia \u2019 s ruling family and business elite have expressed frustration with the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman following the largest-ever attack on the kingdom \u2019 s oil infrastructure last month .\nIt has sparked concern among several prominent branches of the ruling Al Saud family , which numbers around 10,000 members , about the crown prince \u2019 s ability to defend and lead the world \u2019 s largest oil exporter , according to a senior foreign diplomat and five sources with ties to the royals and business elite . All spoke on condition of anonymity .\nThe attack has also fanned discontent among some in elite circles who believe the crown prince , known in the West by the initials MbS , has sought too tight a grip on power , the sources said . Some of these people said the event has also fueled criticism among those who believe he has pursued an overly aggressive stance towards Iran .\n\u201c There is a lot of resentment \u201d about the crown prince \u2019 s leadership , said one of the sources , a member of the Saudi elite with royal connections . \u201c How were they not able to detect the attack ? \u201d\nThis person added that some people in elite circles are saying they have \u201c no confidence \u201d in the crown prince , an assertion echoed by the four other sources and the senior diplomat .\nThe crown prince nonetheless has staunch supporters . A Saudi source within circles loyal to the crown prince said : \u201c The latest events won \u2019 t affect him personally as a potential ruler because he is trying to stop the Iranian expansion in the region . This is a patriotic issue , and so he won \u2019 t be in danger , at least as long as the father lives . \u201d\nA second senior foreign diplomat said ordinary Saudis still want to unite behind MbS as a strong , decisive , dynamic leader .\nThe Saudi government media office did not respond to detailed questions from \u2588\u2588\u2588 for this article .\nThe crown prince , during a television interview aired Sunday by U.S. broadcaster CBS , said that defending Saudi Arabia was difficult because of the kingdom \u2019 s large size and the scale of threats it faces . \u201c It \u2019 s challenging to cover all of this fully , \u201d he said . He also called for \u201c strong and firm \u201d global action to deter Iran but said he preferred a \u201c peaceful solution \u201d to a military one .\nAt stake is political stability in the world \u2019 s largest oil exporter , a key ally of the United States in the Middle East . The crown prince is officially next in line to the throne to his 83-year-old father , King Salman , and is de facto ruler of the country . He has vowed to transform the kingdom into a modern state .\nThe 34-year-old crown prince , who is popular among young Saudis , has received praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom , granting women more rights and pledging to diversify Saudi Arabia \u2019 s oil-dependent economy . But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge levels of genuine enthusiasm domestically .\nThe September 14 attack set ablaze two of state oil giant Saudi Aramco \u2019 s plants , initially knocking out half of the kingdom \u2019 s oil production \u2014 5 % of global oil output . Saudi Arabia has said Iran was responsible , an assessment that U.S. officials share . Iranian officials have denied involvement .\n\u201c The magnitude of these attacks is not lost on the population , nor is the fact that he ( the crown prince ) is the minister of defense and his brother is deputy defense minister , and yet arguably the country has suffered its largest attack ever and on the crown jewels , \u201d said Neil Quilliam , a senior research fellow at Chatham House , a London-based international affairs think tank .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a diminishing confidence in his ability to secure the country \u2013 and that \u2019 s a consequence of his policies , \u201d said Quilliam , a specialist on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf . MbS oversees foreign , security and defense policy .\nThe attack has fueled resentment that has simmered since the crown prince came to power two years ago , sweeping aside rivals to the throne and arresting hundreds of the kingdom \u2019 s most prominent figures on corruption allegations .\nMbS has seen his reputation overseas suffer from a costly war in Yemen against the Iran-aligned Houthi group that has killed tens of thousands of people and triggered a humanitarian crisis . He also came under international criticism over the murder a year ago of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom \u2019 s Istanbul consulate , which the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has said the crown prince ordered .\nThe crown prince , during the CBS interview , denied ordering the killing of Khashoggi but said he ultimately bears \u201c full responsibility \u201d as the kingdom \u2019 s de facto leader .\nKhashoggi was murdered by agents of the Saudi government without authorization or permission , said Saudi Arabia \u2019 s minister of state for foreign affairs , Adel al-Jubeir , during a moderated discussion hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York on September 24 .\nSome Saudi critics say MbS \u2019 s aggressive foreign policy towards Iran and involvement in the war in Yemen exposed the kingdom to attack , according to four of the sources with ties to the royals and business elite . They also express frustration that the crown prince was unable to prevent the attacks despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars on defense , according to the five sources and one of the senior diplomats .\nJubeir , the Saudi minister , in his recent remarks in New York , said the kingdom \u2019 s air defenses have stopped hundreds of ballistic missiles and dozens of drones coming into Saudi Arabia .
