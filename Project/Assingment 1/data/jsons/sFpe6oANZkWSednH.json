Republicans , meanwhile , are hostage to the whims of their nominee . Trump does n't do retail politics , so the party has no choice but to rely on his personality and media presence .

All he has to do is announce three days ahead of time he 's going to be somewhere and a huge crowd shows up. \u201d I admire the optimism , but surely Mr. Gleason knows circus-like crowds wo n't translate to election day turnout . Attracting people to spectacles is easy ; getting them to the polls when it counts is not .\nIt 's scarcely a plan , but GOP operatives are saying ( publicly , at least ) that Trump 's cult of personality will energize disaffected blue collar workers in places like Michigan , Ohio , and Pennsylvania . And they assume that any anxieties about Trump 's blinding incompetence will be eclipsed by hatred of Clinton . Again , I admire the optimism , but this is wish-thinking , not a strategy .\nLogistics aside , the poll numbers in the 11 or so swing states also portend trouble for Republicans . Currently , Clinton holds a 5-point overall advantage over Trump according to Politico 's polling average . She 's leading in 8 of the 11 individual states ( including Florida and Ohio ) , and those numbers are likely to improve as Trump continues to unravel and the Democrats unite behind their nominee . It 's still early , but the numbers offer a snapshot of where the electorate is heading .\nThe national poll numbers tell the same story . A recent Bloomberg poll shows Clinton with a double-digit lead over Trump ( 49 percent to 37 percent ) , a noticeable spike since Clinton became the presumptive nominee . The gender gap is especially worrisome if you 're a Republican . 63 percent of women say they could never vote for the Republican nominee . Women represent a majority of voters \u2013 if 2 out of 3 wo n't vote for Trump , the race is over before it begins .\nThe groups that will decide the election , particularly in swing states , are also strongly opposed to Trump . Clinton is winning 57 percent of women , 58 percent of single voters , and 77 percent of non-whites . Trump is doing far better among white men , but that wo n't compensate for his negatives among every other demographic . Besides , Trump 's appeal with white men is often overstated . As Bloomberg 's John McCormick pointed out , \u201c White men are among Trump 's strongest demographics . But even there he 's not showing as much strength as the party 's last nominee , Mitt Romney , who beat Obama in 2012 by 62 percent to 35 percent among white men. \u201d ( Trump is currently at 50 percent ) .\nThe closer you look at the numbers and the more obvious the organizational gap becomes , the harder it is to see a path to victory for Trump .

They 're led by an organizationally inept candidate who ca n't appeal to women and non-whites and has proven himself incapable of compromise .",
