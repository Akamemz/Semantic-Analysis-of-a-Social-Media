    "content": "On Thursday evening , at one of his ego-nourishing rallies , President Donald Trump took aim at Parasite , Bong Joon-ho \u2019 s South Korean satire that made history as the first foreign film to win the Best Picture Oscar .\n\u201c By the way , how bad were the Academy Awards this year ? You see \u2018 em ? And the winner is\u2026a movie from South Korea . What the hell is that about ? \u201d bellowed a rather clammy Trump . \u201c Was it good ? I don \u2019 t know . I \u2019 m looking for like , let \u2019 s get Gone with the Wind . Can we get Gone with the Wind back , please ? Sunset Boulevard , so many great movies . \u201d\nLet \u2019 s first address the dog-whistle inclusion of Gone with the Wind . There isn \u2019 t a snowball \u2019 s chance in hell that Trump , who has the attention span of a meerkat on high-grade cocaine , has sat through Victor Fleming \u2019 s four-hour-long Civil War epic . What he may be aware of , however , is how the 1939 film\u2014winner of 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture , and the highest-grossing movie ever when adjusted for inflation\u2014is a neo-Confederate monument ; one that romanticizes slavery and the antebellum South , and envisions its wealthy white protagonists as hallowed victims swallowed up by the chaos of Reconstruction . Hattie McDaniel \u2019 s Mammy , the head slave of the film \u2019 s sprawling southern plantation , comes from a long line of racist ( and likely mythical ) stereotypes of \u201c mammy \u201d house slaves ( selfless , grandmotherly ) dating back to Uncle Tom \u2019 s Cabin that were used by Confederate apologists to soften and even attempt to legitimize the unequivocally racist and dehumanizing institution .\nMcDaniel , who eventually became the first Black Oscar winner for her performance , was barred from the film \u2019 s Atlanta premiere due to segregation , and was seated not with the Gone with the Wind cast and crew but at a small table in the back of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub at the 1940 Academy Awards ceremony ( producer David O. Selznick had to lobby the venue to get her in the building ) . Her dying wish , to be buried in Hollywood Cemetery , was also denied because of its whites-only policy .\nIs this the Hollywood that Trump wants to return to ?\nAlso\u2026Sunset Boulevard ? The film , for the record , didn \u2019 t win Best Picture , losing to All About Eve , but more than that , are we to really believe that Trump , a sexist monster who publicly mocked Kim Novak \u2019 s appearance at the 2014 Oscars , empathized with the plight of an aging silent-film actress ? ( Norma Desmond \u2019 s delusions of grandeur , maybe . )\nThere \u2019 s a long , strange history of U.S. presidents screening films in the White House . The first , regrettably , was D.W. Griffith \u2019 s racist celebration of the Ku Klux Klan , The Birth of a Nation , viewed by Woodrow Wilson in the East Room on Feb. 18 , 1915 . Bill Clinton \u2019 s inaugural screening was Lorenzo \u2019 s Oil , a crowdsourced pick if there ever was one . Trump \u2019 s was Finding Dory , whose message of inclusion appeared to be lost on Trump , according to the film \u2019 s star Ellen DeGeneres .\nOver the past century , presidents have also been queried on their favorite films . Lyndon B. Johnson would watch a 10-minute short about himself , narrated by Gregory Peck , over and over again in the White House , while Ronald Reagan , a former Hollywood actor , would suffer through his own mediocre oeuvre on his birthday each year . Gerald Ford \u2019 s favorite movie , funnily enough , was said to be Home Alone ( Trump would later make a cameo in its sequel ) . Years ago , when a Twitter user asked Trump to name his favorite films , the then-reality-TV host cited Citizen Kane , Gone with the Wind , and The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Yet when it comes to Orson Welles \u2019 magnum opus , chronicling the rise and fall of a power-hungry media tycoon , he \u2019 s made it resoundingly clear that he has no grasp on the film \u2019 s central message .\n\u201c When asked for the one piece of advice he \u2019 d give Charles Foster Kane , [ Trump ] offered : \u201c Get yourself a different woman . \u201d \u201d\nAs part of the 2002 Oscars , famed documentarian Errol Morris was given the unenviable task of filming influential pop-culture figures discussing their favorite movies . Trump picked Citizen Kane , and , when asked for the one piece of advice he \u2019 d give Charles Foster Kane , offered : \u201c Get yourself a different woman . \u201d\nMorris opened up to The Ringer about the surrealness of that moment . \u201c So he starts to tell me about Charles Foster Kane , who he identifies with . And what was Charles Foster Kane \u2019 s real problem ? Was his problem that he was a megalomaniac ? Not so much . Was his problem that he treated people around him miserably ? Nah ! What was his problem ? According to Donald Trump , his problem was the woman he married . \u201d\nHe later added of the encounter , \u201c It \u2019 s obvious : this person is insane . \u201d\nThough Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind are fashionable picks , Trump \u2019 s real favorite movie is rumored to be Bloodsport , the 1988 martial-arts flick starring the Muscles from Brussels , Jean-Claude Van Damme . Writer Mark Singer was the first to document Trump \u2019 s fixation with Bloodsport in a 1997 profile for The New Yorker .\nWhilst flying around in Trump \u2019 s tacky , gold-plated private jet , Singer recalled , \u201c We hadn \u2019 t been airborne long when Trump decided to watch a movie . He \u2019 d brought along Michael , a recent release , but twenty minutes after popping it into the VCR he got bored and switched to an old favorite , a Jean Claude Van Damme slugfest called Bloodsport , which he pronounced \u2018 an incredible , fantastic movie . \u2019 \u201d\nThe bankrupted real-estate mogul \u2019 s attention span was so low that , according to Singer , Trump would make his then-teenage son , Donald Trump Jr. , fast-forward to all the fight scenes : \u201c By assigning to his son the task of fast-forwarding through all the plot exposition\u2014Trump \u2019 s goal being \u2018 to get this two-hour movie down to forty-five minutes \u2019 \u2014he eliminated any lulls between the nose hammering , kidney tenderizing , and shin whacking. \u201d ( That 19-year-old Don Jr. served as Trump \u2019 s private jet remote-control servant explains so very much . )\nTrump \u2019 s questionable taste in movies and culture-war carnival-barking notwithstanding , what we can be certain of is that he is truly , madly , deeply obsessed with the Academy Awards .

At the 2015 Oscars , which saw Birdman win Best Picture and Alejandro G.
