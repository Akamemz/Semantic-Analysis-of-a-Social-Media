Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens , President Obama this morning told delegates to the United Nations that the diplomat 's killers will not determine the world 's future .

In Conclusion , He Returns To Stevens ' Example :\n`` I promise you this , '' Obama says as he concludes . `` Long after these killers are brought to justice , Chris Stevens ' legacy will live on in the lives he touched .
