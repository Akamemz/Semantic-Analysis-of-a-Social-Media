That question has riled American politics since the federal income tax came into being . In 2014 , the rich ( the $ 250,000-plus set ) paid just over half of all federal individual income taxes , according to Pew , while those making less than $ 50,000 paid only 5.7 percent .\nAs evidence mounts that the very rich have reaped almost all the nation 's economic gains since the Great Recession , reformers are pushing to impose a higher income tax rate on the rich .
