    "content": "My central supposition about this election is that Donald Trump will lose because most regular middle Americans just won \u2019 t vote to make that man their president . This has nothing to do with ideology . It \u2019 s just about Trump . Not everyone out there adores Hillary Clinton by a long shot , and I understand well that for a lot of people this is a choice between beef liver and lumpfish , but I just think at the end of the day most people will say , No , I just can \u2019 t\u2014I just can \u2019 t help make that crude , boorish , vindictive , childish man the president of the United States .\nI think this is what will save Clinton\u2014and the country\u2014in the end . But as soon as I think that , I think : But what if I \u2019 m wrong ? What could make people change their views on Trump , become sympathetic to him ?\nIn theory , a number of things . Trump could stop being crude , boorish , vindictive , and childish . ( I said \u201c in theory. \u201d ) Clinton could be indicted . The economy could tank . I think those are unlikely\u2014and yes , I saw the jobs report , but it \u2019 s early days to start talking about a recession , and it may be a silver lining of the report that it makes the Fed wait longer to raise rates , which most economists I talk to think it should do anyway .\nBut here \u2019 s one thing that \u2019 s not a long shot\u2014and is in fact happening right now\u2014that I fear will make Trump a more sympathetic figure to the kinds of Americans I \u2019 m talking about : left-wing protestors turning violent and throwing eggs at Trump supporters and burning hats and flags .\nNow no doubt , someone has already fired off an abusive tweet at me calling me names and screaming at me that I just want powerless people to STFU , as they say in Twitterland . No , I do not want powerless people to STFU . I emphatically want powerless people to have more power . And the way you get more power in this country is by protesting peacefully , and voting , and doing all those boring things .\nAnd I emphatically don \u2019 t want a racist , misogynist , neo-fascist in the Oval Office . But violent protests at his rallies increase the likelihood of us getting exactly that .\nThe operative word in that previous sentence is violent . Protest , Americans like . It \u2019 s in the DNA and all that . Protest got us where we are . It got us the 40-hour work week , the civil rights revolution , the end of the Vietnam war . Occasionally in these instances , things turned violent , especially in the case of labor organizing . But usually , the violence was initiated by those who held the power\u2014the companies , in the case of union organizing , or the state , in the case of civil rights .\nIn the modem-day American context , it \u2019 s not in the interest of the powerless to initiate violence . They \u2019 ll always get screwed . Always . They \u2019 ll always be blamed by the media , called \u201c rabble-rousers \u201d and \u201c trouble-makers , \u201d and the worst of the footage , like those people throwing eggs at that woman in the Trump football jersey in San Jose , will be shown over and over and over again , giving my regular middle Americans up above reason to think the violence was 50 times worse than it actually was .\nAnd those regular middle Americans will say to each other : \u201c Goodness , Jean , those protestors are just awful , aren \u2019 t they ? \u201d\n\u201c Why , yes they are , Bob . So rude ! And dirty , too . \u201d\nAnd it will go on from there , and that night after dinner , they \u2019 ll flip on CNN ( because these are not Fox viewers\u2014an important point ) and they \u2019 ll see more footage and they \u2019 ll see interviews with Trump supporters who were standing there more or less minding their own business and suddenly got their faces punched in , and they \u2019 ll work themselves into a reactionary state and decide that maybe a vindictive boor is precisely what those people need .\nI guess the thinking of violent protestors is , Trump is a fascist , and the right response to fascism is violence . In some times and some places , yes , it \u2019 s been the necessary response . But we \u2019 re not anywhere near that point . Trump doesn \u2019 t have a private army . Yes , some of his rallies were getting awfully creepy there for a while , and he did inexcusably egg his people on toward violence . But all that has tapered off . If Trump won the presidency and assumed emergency powers , then yeah , I \u2019 d understand violence then . Might even advocate for it .
