''\nThe ACLU 's lawsuit \u2014 which names as defendants the heads of national intelligence as well as the agencies they lead , including the National Security Agency , the FBI , the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice \u2014 argues the phone record collection program disclosed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden is unconstitutional .\nThe suit , filed in federal court in New York in June , asks the court to halt the datamining effort and purge phone records collected under the program , claiming the government action violates the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution .\nThe NRA argues in the brief that it would be `` absurd '' to think that Congress would take steps to prevent the creation of a national gun registry while simultaneously allowing the NSA to gather records that `` could effectively create just such a registry .
