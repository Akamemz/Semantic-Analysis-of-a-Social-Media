    "content": "\u201c In the expansive realm of congressional dysfunction , there are few recent examples that surpass the failure to shield from deportation hundreds of thousands of unauthorized migrants , now in their 20s and 30s , who have grown up , studied and entered the job force after being brought to the United States as children\u2026 It was August 2001 when then-Sen. Orrin G. Hatch , a Utah Republican , and Sen. Richard J. Durbin , an Illinois Democrat , introduced the Dream Act , outlining a pathway to legal permanent residency for migrants who entered the United States as minors , usually with their parents . Since then , repeated iterations of that measure have become enmeshed in the broader partisan impasse over immigration , even as lawmakers , including many Republicans , voiced ritual sympathy for dreamers\u2026 \u201c An attempt to break the logjam last year , with a compromise pairing a long-term fix for the dreamers with funding for border security , including President Trump \u2019 s wall , fizzled in the Senate when he threatened a veto . Now that the president is building portions of the wall anyway , by diverting funds appropriated by Congress for the military , what possible justification can lawmakers find to avoid doing the moral and humane thing by guaranteeing a normal life for dreamers ? \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c No matter how the U.S. Supreme Court rules\u2026 the fact that the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program came down to an up or down vote of six men and three women is itself a lesson in how Washington works \u2014 which is to say , not well . Only the most anti-immigrant extremist believes the 700,000 or so individuals eligible for the DACA program \u2014 straight-arrow young people with no criminal record , a high school degree and , in some cases , a record of U.S. military service \u2014 should be expelled from this country , the only home many of them have ever known. \u201d Editorial Board , Baltimore Sun\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s core argument is that the decision to end DACA is not reviewable in court in the first place , that it is the type of decision that is \u2018 committed to agency discretion \u2019 and so not open to challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act . As the plaintiffs \u2019 briefs point out , that is a strange argument , because if the administration is right that DACA was illegal from the start , then ending it is a matter of legal compulsion rather than discretion ; in any event , legality is quintessentially a question for judges\u2026 \u201c The court \u2019 s eventual decision in the case\u2026 is obviously of vital importance to the young people who in the seven years since DACA began have been able to study , work legally and start families . But the decision will also be important in defining the court \u2019 s relationship to a president who behaves as if he has the Supreme Court in his pocket . It will indicate whether the Roberts court \u2014 more specifically , the chief justice himself \u2014 will continue to insist on believable explanations from an administration that often appears incapable of giving one. \u201d Linda Greenhouse , New York Times\n\u201c One principle of administrative law , codified in the Administrative Procedure Act , is that \u2018 legislative rules \u2019 are to be announced in advance , giving the public a chance to comment before a final rule issues\u2026 DHS had not used notice and comment to announceDACA . But rescinding a program may be different from announcing one , because of what lawyers call \u2018 reliance interests \u2019 ... The day before DACA was announced , no one had a right to expect it , and no one had made use of it . But after DACA went into operation , nearly 900,000 people took advantage of it . Relying on the government \u2019 s description of the program , they risked eventual deportation by revealing their personal information to DHS ; in exchange , they received \u2018 work authorization , \u2019 which meant they could apply for driver \u2019 s licenses , attend school , and hold jobs like other residents . Rescinding the program without warning would jerk the rug out from under them. \u201d Garrett Epps , The Atlantic\n\u201c Until now , every administration over the past 60 years has adopted similar humanitarian policies . In 1956 , President Dwight Eisenhower protected tens of thousands of Hungarian refugees from deportation after they fled Soviet Union rule ; Presidents Eisenhower , John Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon protected more than 600,000 Cuban immigrants escaping an oppressive regime ; and President Bill Clinton established a deferred action program for those petitioning for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994\u2026 To date , five federal courts have found the administration \u2019 s decision to end the [ DACA ] program arbitrary and capricious. \u201d Janet Napolitano and John A. Perez , USA Today\n\u201c The Trump administration has filed a 57-page brief defending DACA \u2019 s rescission in the Supreme Court , and it says not a single word about DACA \u2019 s supposed unconstitutionality\u2026 Presidents dating back to Dwight Eisenhower have granted deferred action status to immigrants who would be otherwise removable , including on the scale presented by DACA : A 1987 Reagan administration program authorized relief to some 1.5 million undocumented people\u2026 Trump himself made clear that he did not believe DACA exceeded his constitutional or statutory authority . After all , on the exact day the Department of Homeland Security announced DACA \u2019 s rescission , the president tweeted that if Congress would not legalize DACA , he would \u2018 revisit this issue \u2019 himself. \u201d Aaron Tang , Slate\nThe right believes the administration should win on the legal merits , and calls for a legislative solution .\n\u201c In September 2017 Mr. Trump ordered the program wound down and gave Congress six months to protect [ DACA ] recipients with an option to renew work permits for two years . The goal was to use the time to negotiate a political compromise , but Democrats walked away after lower courts enjoined the rescission and removed an impetus for compromise\u2026 Remarkably , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Administration could end [ DACA ] for valid policy reasons , but that the justification it gave was arbitrary and capricious\u2026\n\u201c This is a case of judges deciding when a President can enforce laws or reverse actions by a previous executive . Will a Democratic President next have to go through notice and comment to alter Mr. Trump \u2019 s border enforcement or rescind his \u2018 national emergency \u2019 at the border ? Congress would likely have come to a sensible compromise to protect the young immigrants if judges had not short-circuited the legislative process . [ DACA ] recipients who in good faith identified themselves to the government should be protected , but this is for Congress and the President to negotiate\u2014not for unelected judges to pre-empt . \u201d\n\u201c A similar program \u2014 \u2018 DAPA , \u2019 for the illegal-immigrant parents of citizen and permanent-resident kids \u2014 was actually struck down in a lower court as illegal . ( In 2016 , the Supreme Court deadlocked 4\u20134 on the question of DAPA \u2019 s legality , making the lower court \u2019 s ruling the final say . ) But this case isn \u2019 t even a direct challenge to the legality of DACA . The Court is being asked to refuse to let the Trump administration end the illegal program voluntarily , on the grounds that the administration didn \u2019 t adequately explain its decision to do so\u2026\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s initial explanation may have been terse , but how much more of a reason does one need than that the program is flagrantly illegal and runs an obvious risk of being struck down in court ? \u201d\n\u201c Even if you think the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was legal\u2026 it was not enacted through the notice-and-comment process mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act for issuing regulations \u2014 it was just a memo from then-DHS secretary Janet Napolitano ostensibly outlining prosecutorial-discretion guidelines to her three subordinates who handled immigration matters . The idea that a subsequent administration can \u2019 t issue a superseding memo without going through notice-and-comment is ludicrous\u2026\n\u201c Assuming the Court rules in favor of the administration in , say , June 2020 \u2014 what then ? \u2026 \u200d \u201c One possibility might be to stop issuing renewals immediately but let existing work permits continue until they expire , at an average rate of about 1,000 a day . Then call on Congress to finally pass a targeted package that gives DACAs green cards in exchange for , say , mandatory E-Verify ( to make it less likely we \u2019 ll have DACA situations in the future ) and ending the visa lottery ( to partly offset the extra legal immigration represented by the amnesty ) . Alternatively , the White House could punt until after the election : announce that renewals will continue to be processed , but only through the end of 2020 , after which work permits will begin expiring , leaving it to the new Congress and the new ( or incumbent ) president to work out a deal . \u201d\nSome argue that \u201c it \u2019 s true that Mr. Trump campaigned in 2016 on ending DACA , but he also promised to \u2018 take care \u2019 of the Dreamers . They deserve to be protected , not treated like suckers\u2026 The program now affects roughly 700,000 people , including close to 1,000 members of the military .
