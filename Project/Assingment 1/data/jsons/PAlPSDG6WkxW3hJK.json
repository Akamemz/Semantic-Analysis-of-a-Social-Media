America is in a \u201c historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens. \u201d We are at war , \u201c fighting the coronavirus on every possible front . \u201d\nGoing to war requires identifying the enemy , something Trump has never had much trouble doing . Since the coronavirus emerged , he has repeatedly taken aim at old standbys \u2014 the \u201c Opposition Party ( Lamestream Media ) \u201d and the Democrats \u2014 as well as a range of newer targets , from China ( and the \u201c Chinese virus \u201d ) to companies like 3M to governors begging for more medical supplies for their states to a more nebulous \u201c Invisible Enemy \u201d he \u2019 s begun referring to in tweets :\nThe Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) April 10 , 2020\nWith the courage of our doctors and nurses , with the skill of our scientists and innovators , with the determination of the American People , and with the grace of God , WE WILL WIN THIS WAR , \u201d he tweeted on March 28 . \u201c When we achieve this victory , we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before ! \u201d\nIt \u2019 s plainly obvious that Trump isn \u2019 t the first person to use war as a metaphor for fighting a virus , nor is he the only leader to evoke war while speaking about efforts to save lives and find cures . The metaphor isn \u2019 t linked to a particular political party or persuasion , either : In his March 30 press briefing , Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo , who has likened health care workers to \u201c troops , \u201d explicitly agreed with Trump :\nIn this situation , there are no red states , and there are no blue states , and there are no red casualties , and there are no blue casualties . It is red , white and blue . This virus doesn \u2019 t discriminate . It attacks everyone , and it attacks everywhere . The president said this is a war . I agree with that . This is a war . Then let \u2019 s act that way , and let \u2019 s act that way now . And let \u2019 s show a commonality in a mutuality and a unity that this country has not seen in decades , because the lord knows we need it today more than ever before .\nDr. Richard Hatchett , CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and a former member of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations , has also said that war is an appropriate analogy for fighting the coronavirus . And he comes from a position of knowledge : In 2005 and 2006 , Hatchett was the director for biodefense policy on the White House Homeland Security Council , and he was a principal author of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan .\nUsing war as a metaphor for illness during a pandemic or global crisis is not just a contemporary occurrence . \u201c There is an ancient and cross-cultural tendency to frame disease in terms of war , \u201d Lisa Keranen told me . Keranen is an associate professor of communications at the University of Colorado Denver and a medical rhetorician who studies how we speak about viruses and other biological threats . She noted that some scholars have located centuries-old uses in China of defensive and martial language to talk about defending your health .\nJ. Blake Scott , a professor at the University of Central Florida who studies medical rhetoric and has focused on the AIDS crisis of the 1980s , agreed . \u201c There are lots of reasons why that metaphor took hold , \u201d Scott told me . In fact , he said , war as metaphor for fighting a pandemic has bubbled up across human history .\n\u201c I think there are political reasons for that , \u201d he said . \u201c But more broadly , there are cultural reasons and historical patterns . Diseases accompany wars ; we use military resources to combat disease and pandemics . Wars are thought of as winnable ; you have winners and losers. \u201d He also said that at times , people with diseases like cancer and diabetes find that war metaphors are empowering and effective in increasing morale . \u201c That could maybe work collectively , too \u2014 there \u2019 s this communal mobilization , \u201d he added .\nAnd though you can \u2019 t scare a virus the way you can frighten an enemy , we still use that metaphor because it makes sense to us intuitively . \u201c Even before we knew what a virus was , sickness is often cast as an invader to your system , something from outside , \u201d Keranen said .\nThis is a phenomenon that the writer Susan Sontag explored at length in her seminal 1978 essay \u201c Illness as Metaphor , \u201d which was collected in 1989 with her follow-up essay , \u201c AIDS and Its Metaphors. \u201d Sontag writes extensively of the war-like nature of metaphors used for cancer :\nThe controlling metaphors in descriptions of cancer are , in fact , drawn not from economics but from the language of warfare : every physician and every attentive patient is familiar with , if perhaps inured to , this military terminology . Thus , cancer cells do not simply multiply ; they are \u201c invasive. \u201d ( \u201c Malignant tumors invade even when they grow very slowly , \u201d as one textbook puts it . ) Cancer cells \u201c colonize \u201d from the original tumor to far sites in the body , first setting up tiny outposts ( \u201c micrometastases \u201d ) whose presence is assumed , though they can not be detected .\nAnd that has a warping effect in the \u201c war on cancer , \u201d Sontag writes : \u201c The bromides of the American cancer establishment , tirelessly hailing the imminent victory over cancer ; the professional pessimism of a large number of cancer specialists , talking like battle-weary officers mired down in an interminable colonial war\u2014these are twin distortions in this military rhetoric about cancer . \u201d\nYet metaphors are inescapable , no matter how apt , misleading , or simply inadequate they may be . They \u2019 re key to how humans to wrap their minds around phenomena they don \u2019 t totally understand . Sontag argued that we should try to resist metaphors for understanding illnesses ( including AIDS ) , but convincing people to stop using them is an uphill battle at best . Anything mysterious , frightening , or unknowable will inevitably be stuffed into a framework drawn from something we do understand .\nHumans have understood war for all of human history . So it \u2019 s no big surprise that the war metaphor keeps cropping up . Metaphors like this \u201c might be comforting , or give us hope in some way , \u201d Scott told me . \u201c Or they might reinforce differences that make us feel like we can do something to be safer . \u201d\nCan we do something to keep ourselves and others safe during this pandemic ? Sure . We can wash our hands . We can stay home as much as possible . We can donate money and sew face masks . We can promote and conduct scientific research , manufacture ventilators , care for the sick . We can pray , or engage in some other spiritual activity .\nHow will those actions aid our fight against the \u201c invisible enemy \u201d ? We don \u2019 t know yet . Right now , results are staggered and uncertain . But in the meantime , repeating the war metaphor could hinder what we \u2019 re trying to accomplish , both now and in the long term .\nThe usefulness of any metaphor is limited by default , since they use one concept to explain another that is not precisely the same . Language itself is full of metaphors , and we can never describe reality perfectly through language . Critics of the war metaphor argue that it is an attempt , unconscious or otherwise , to alter reality , to not see a viral threat for what it is . ( Even the idea of a \u201c viral \u201d threat has become metaphorical in the computer age , some critics have argued . )\nDuring my conversation with Keranen , she listed many reasons why the war metaphor can shape our ideas about how we should fight a pandemic \u2014 what we should do , what we shouldn \u2019 t do , who is to blame , and what gets left out of the picture .\nOne problem is that the \u201c war \u201d metaphor can cause people to stigmatize those with the disease because they can \u2019 t \u201c fight it off. \u201d Sontag wrote of this stigma toward cancer patients , describing the shame and lack of openness about options for treatment in the 1970s because of the stigma . \u201c Even today , we talk about people whose immune systems are \u2018 weaker \u2019 because they can \u2019 t fight off Covid-19 , \u201d Keranen said . \u201c There \u2019 s almost a smuggling of some implicit blame in there for someone who is a victim of a disease . \u201d\nFraming Covid-19 or any viral outbreak as war can also influence the way we think about those who die . \u201c It can imply that deaths are collateral damage and might just need to happen so that we can \u2018 fight on the front lines , \u2019 \u201d Keranen said . \u201c So if we \u2019 re prioritizing where ventilators are going to go , that means that they might go to New York and places that are seen as the battlefront , as compared to more rural areas . \u201d\nThe idea of lives as collateral damage has taken root among some of Trump \u2019 s supporters , who have suggested that his greatest enemies \u2014 and thus the group aligned with the virus \u2014 are Democrats , as well as those who take strict measures to limit activity in order to save lives :\nDennis Prager : `` That attitude that the only value is saving a life , that attitude leads to appeasement ... No one can die ? Then it 's not a war '' pic.twitter.com/jtMDtJBzYf \u2014 Jason Campbell ( @ JasonSCampbell ) March 24 , 2020\nFurthermore , war metaphors are inherently biased toward power , aggression , and even paternalism . \u201c It makes our focus be on fighting and not on caring , \u201d Keranen says . \u201c It \u2019 s not that we \u2019 re not caring for people , \u201d but if we \u2019 re fixated on fighting an enemy , \u201c that might put us in a framework where we \u2019 re less thinking about support and care and broader networks that we need to put into place . \u201d\nThis mindset can draw focus away from scrutinizing broad preparedness and emphasizing its importance \u2014 perhaps counterintuitive , since governments exist in part to protect their citizens from enemies both within and beyond their borders . But using a war metaphor for a pandemic lets us minimize resulting deaths as inevitable , Keranen says . We were attacked , so deaths are \u201c casualties \u201d rather than unnecessary and preventable tragedies . \u201c It shifts our focus away from government preparedness to individual responsibility , \u201d she added . \u201c If we all just wash our hands and stay inside , then we can do our part in this \u2018 battle . \u2019 \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a geographic component to war metaphors , too , Scott says . And that component can reshape how we think about collective versus individual responsibility , leading to a \u201c geography of blame \u201d \u2014 the attempt to assign fault for the pandemic to one region , like China , Europe , or New York City . He pointed to Florida as example , noting that Gov . Ron DeSantis refused to close beaches to spring breakers for weeks in March but required people returning to the state from New York , New Jersey , or Connecticut to self-quarantine for 14 days .\nA war metaphor can also have dark consequences . \u201c If we look at history , during times of war , it \u2019 s often been the case that war is accompanied by abuses of medicine and the suspension of widespread ethical norms , \u201d Keranen said , citing Nazi use of medicine or other public health trials that have been conducted on prisoners and war resistors over the years . \u201c Especially now , we need to be on guard for this with the clinical trials and other product development that we \u2019 re undergoing , so that in our haste to \u2018 fight \u2019 the disease with a military metaphor , we \u2019 re not giving away our fundamental ethical concepts and principles . \u201d\nPeople are unlikely to stop using the pandemic-as-war metaphor anytime soon . But is there a better option to articulate what we \u2019 re facing , to illustrate the challenge of caring for the sick and finding a cure ?\nThere are certainly other metaphors . They \u2019 re imperfect , too . And yet , just thinking about them can help us see what we lose when we resort to and rely on the language of war .\nAnother possible metaphor for illness presents healing as a journey or a river , which can remind us of the passage of time and the connectedness of everyone who embarks on the same trek or follows the same path . It also emphasizes the need for preparedness , since journeys involve mapping out a route and rivers typically remain in their riverbeds , which means their route can be predicted . Certainly emergencies and the unexpected can happen , but there are some obstacles we can anticipate .\nScott also suggested a metaphor that centers on an orchestra or symphony \u2014 built on the idea that responding to a pandemic requires everyone involved to be equipped to play their part , for everyone to have a role . \u201c A lot of these metaphors blur distinctions between the self and the Other that war metaphors throw into relief , \u201d Scott said . They emphasize the need to coordinate response , rather than only look out for oneself , and \u201c they \u2019 re not focused just on causes ; they \u2019 re focused on responses and preparedness , \u201d he added .\nKeranen explained that another problem with using the war metaphor for a pandemic is that it reduces the complexity of the problem and focuses us solely on \u201c beating \u201d the virus , without fully considering the factors that might have facilitated its proliferation \u2014 like deforestation and destroyed habitats that could contribute to future pandemics \u2014 or possible risk factors , such as poor air quality , that may make humans susceptible . \u201c It really masks that broader ecological picture , \u201d she said .\nIndeed , everyone I spoke to while reporting this piece brought up the idea of ecology and microbiomes , not just as literal matters of concern with regard to the coronavirus but also as a strong metaphor for approaching the threat it poses to humans . Instead of thinking of this pandemic as a war \u2014 us versus them , humans versus invading virus \u2014 what if we reframed our thinking to imagine our goal as finding balance in not only the natural world , but in our social and cultural worlds as well ?\nTheir suggestions made me think about The Biggest Little Farm , a 2019 documentary about the owners of a biodynamic family farm in California . Over an eight-year period , they came to see new pests or problems on the farm as evidence that something was out of balance , not simply an enemy to attack and destroy .\nJodie Nicotra , an associate professor at the University of Idaho , praised the ecological metaphor as a strong one . Nicotra is writing a book on the rhetorics of microbiome science . \u201c In one of the Democratic debates , Bernie Sanders was asked how he would respond to the coronavirus situation , \u201d she told me . \u201c He started by talking about universal health care . Joe Biden was like , \u2018 We \u2019 ll get the National Guard out and set up field hospitals , \u2019 and so on . There seemed to be more general praise for Biden \u2019 s approach . But I think more ecological , community-based thinking \u2014 basically , the opposite of whatever we do now \u2014 would have probably prevented a lot of these issues . \u201d\nWhat an ecological metaphor offers that a war metaphor can \u2019 t provide \u2014 due to its dependence on drawing a line between winners and losers , between us and the enemy \u2014 is what Nicotra calls the \u201c invisible connections \u201d between things . \u201c You don \u2019 t see how vast economic inequality connects to a virus , but it does , \u201d she says . \u201c You don \u2019 t see the webs of regulations and laws , or the production of equipment . You have to see that all of this stuff is bound up together and train yourself to see these connections between things . \u201d\nIn truth , metaphors are inescapable . We \u2019 re going to keep using them because they give us a way to imagine the world . They are a kind of grammar our brains rely on to operate . But that grammar is limiting nonetheless .\nWe \u2019 re less limited in which metaphors we choose . And so , while the war metaphor may have some use , it would be wise for us to expand our thinking and the language we use to express it . There \u2019 s no reason we have to stick to just one metaphor , regardless of what certain politicians might prefer .\n\u201c If we take as a premise that we , as a culture , acknowledge a distributed expertise or set of solutions for dealing with something like this , then that kind of opens it up , \u201d Scott told me . \u201c There are more groups , more people , more institutions to figure out responses . Those we thought of as experts at controlling risk haven \u2019 t always been all that successful . We need alternative ways of thinking in response to these things . \u201d\nWe also need to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism when we \u2019 re confronted with a particular metaphor every day . Is it the only way to address the issue at hand ? Are we flattening the problem in ways that benefit some people over others , or that lead us toward harmful conclusions ?\nWe can still use the language of chess , if it helps . But we shouldn \u2019 t ignore the vast array of human experience just begging to be tapped to help us more thoroughly understand what the problem is and how we might solve it \u2014 even in a pandemic .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

Wars are thought of as winnable; you have winners and losers.\u201d He also said that at times, people with diseases like cancer and diabetes find that war metaphors are empowering and effective in increasing morale. \u201cThat could maybe work collectively, too \u2014 there\u2019s this communal mobilization,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd though you can\u2019t scare a virus the way you can frighten an enemy, we still use that metaphor because it makes sense to us intuitively. \u201cEven before we knew what a virus was, sickness is often cast as an invader to your system, something from outside,\u201d Keranen said.\n\nThis is a phenomenon that the writer Susan Sontag explored at length in her seminal 1978 essay \u201cIllness as Metaphor,\u201d which was collected in 1989 with her follow-up essay, \u201cAIDS and Its Metaphors.\u201d Sontag writes extensively of the war-like nature of metaphors used for cancer:\n\nThe controlling metaphors in descriptions of cancer are, in fact, drawn not from economics but from the language of warfare: every physician and every attentive patient is familiar with, if perhaps inured to, this military terminology. Thus, cancer cells do not simply multiply; they are \u201cinvasive.\u201d (\u201cMalignant tumors invade even when they grow very slowly,\u201d as one textbook puts it.) Cancer cells \u201ccolonize\u201d from the original tumor to far sites in the body, first setting up tiny outposts (\u201cmicrometastases\u201d) whose presence is assumed, though they cannot be detected.\n\nAnd that has a warping effect in the \u201cwar on cancer,\u201d Sontag writes: \u201cThe bromides of the American cancer establishment, tirelessly hailing the imminent victory over cancer; the professional pessimism of a large number of cancer specialists, talking like battle-weary officers mired down in an interminable colonial war\u2014these are twin distortions in this military rhetoric about cancer.\u201d\n\nYet metaphors are inescapable, no matter how apt, misleading, or simply inadequate they may be. They\u2019re key to how humans to wrap their minds around phenomena they don\u2019t totally understand. Sontag argued that we should try to resist metaphors for understanding illnesses (including AIDS), but convincing people to stop using them is an uphill battle at best. Anything mysterious, frightening, or unknowable will inevitably be stuffed into a framework drawn from something we do understand.\n\nHumans have understood war for all of human history. So it\u2019s no big surprise that the war metaphor keeps cropping up. Metaphors like this \u201cmight be comforting, or give us hope in some way,\u201d Scott told me. \u201cOr they might reinforce differences that make us feel like we can do something to be safer.\u201d\n\nCan we do something to keep ourselves and others safe during this pandemic? Sure. We can wash our hands. We can stay home as much as possible. We can donate money and sew face masks. We can promote and conduct scientific research, manufacture ventilators, care for the sick. We can pray, or engage in some other spiritual activity.\n\nHow will those actions aid our fight against the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d? We don\u2019t know yet. Right now, results are staggered and uncertain. But in the meantime, repeating the war metaphor could hinder what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, both now and in the long term.\n\nUsing metaphors of war brings the baggage of war\n\nThe usefulness of any metaphor is limited by default, since they use one concept to explain another that is not precisely the same. Language itself is full of metaphors, and we can never describe reality perfectly through language. Critics of the war metaphor argue that it is an attempt, unconscious or otherwise, to alter reality, to not see a viral threat for what it is. (Even the idea of a \u201cviral\u201d threat has become metaphorical in the computer age, some critics have argued.)\n\nDuring my conversation with Keranen, she listed many reasons why the war metaphor can shape our ideas about how we should fight a pandemic \u2014 what we should do, what we shouldn\u2019t do, who is to blame, and what gets left out of the picture.\n\nOne problem is that the \u201cwar\u201d metaphor can cause people to stigmatize those with the disease because they can\u2019t \u201cfight it off.\u201d Sontag wrote of this stigma toward cancer patients, describing the shame and lack of openness about options for treatment in the 1970s because of the stigma. \u201cEven today, we talk about people whose immune systems are \u2018weaker\u2019 because they can\u2019t fight off Covid-19,\u201d Keranen said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost a smuggling of some implicit blame in there for someone who is a victim of a disease.\u201d\n\nFraming Covid-19 or any viral outbreak as war can also influence the way we think about those who die. \u201cIt can imply that deaths are collateral damage and might just need to happen so that we can \u2018fight on the front lines,\u2019\u201d Keranen said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re prioritizing where ventilators are going to go, that means that they might go to New York and places that are seen as the battlefront, as compared to more rural areas.\u201d\n\nThe idea of lives as collateral damage has taken root among some of Trump\u2019s supporters, who have suggested that his greatest enemies \u2014 and thus the group aligned with the virus \u2014 are Democrats, as well as those who take strict measures to limit activity in order to save lives:\n\nDennis Prager: \"That attitude that the only value is saving a life, that attitude leads to appeasement...No one can die? Then it's not a war\" pic.twitter.com/jtMDtJBzYf \u2014 Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) March 24, 2020\n\nFurthermore, war metaphors are inherently biased toward power, aggression, and even paternalism. \u201cIt makes our focus be on fighting and not on caring,\u201d Keranen says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re not caring for people,\u201d but if we\u2019re fixated on fighting an enemy, \u201cthat might put us in a framework where we\u2019re less thinking about support and care and broader networks that we need to put into place.\u201d\n\nThis mindset can draw focus away from scrutinizing broad preparedness and emphasizing its importance \u2014 perhaps counterintuitive, since governments exist in part to protect their citizens from enemies both within and beyond their borders. But using a war metaphor for a pandemic lets us minimize resulting deaths as inevitable, Keranen says. We were attacked, so deaths are \u201ccasualties\u201d rather than unnecessary and preventable tragedies. \u201cIt shifts our focus away from government preparedness to individual responsibility,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we all just wash our hands and stay inside, then we can do our part in this \u2018battle.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated A syllabus for the end of the world\n\nThere\u2019s a geographic component to war metaphors, too, Scott says. And that component can reshape how we think about collective versus individual responsibility, leading to a \u201cgeography of blame\u201d \u2014 the attempt to assign fault for the pandemic to one region, like China, Europe, or New York City. He pointed to Florida as example, noting that Gov. Ron DeSantis refused to close beaches to spring breakers for weeks in March but required people returning to the state from New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shifting the blame that way,\u201d Scott said.\n\nA war metaphor can also have dark consequences. \u201cIf we look at history, during times of war, it\u2019s often been the case that war is accompanied by abuses of medicine and the suspension of widespread ethical norms,\u201d Keranen said, citing Nazi use of medicine or other public health trials that have been conducted on prisoners and war resistors over the years. \u201cEspecially now, we need to be on guard for this with the clinical trials and other product development that we\u2019re undergoing, so that in our haste to \u2018fight\u2019 the disease with a military metaphor, we\u2019re not giving away our fundamental ethical concepts and principles.\u201d\n\nCould ecology provide better metaphors in a pandemic?\n\nPeople are unlikely to stop using the pandemic-as-war metaphor anytime soon. But is there a better option to articulate what we\u2019re facing, to illustrate the challenge of caring for the sick and finding a cure?\n\nThere are certainly other metaphors. They\u2019re imperfect, too. And yet, just thinking about them can help us see what we lose when we resort to and rely on the language of war.\n\nAnother possible metaphor for illness presents healing as a journey or a river, which can remind us of the passage of time and the connectedness of everyone who embarks on the same trek or follows the same path. It also emphasizes the need for preparedness, since journeys involve mapping out a route and rivers typically remain in their riverbeds, which means their route can be predicted. Certainly emergencies and the unexpected can happen, but there are some obstacles we can anticipate.\n\nScott also suggested a metaphor that centers on an orchestra or symphony \u2014 built on the idea that responding to a pandemic requires everyone involved to be equipped to play their part, for everyone to have a role. \u201cA lot of these metaphors blur distinctions between the self and the Other that war metaphors throw into relief,\u201d Scott said. They emphasize the need to coordinate response, rather than only look out for oneself, and \u201cthey\u2019re not focused just on causes; they\u2019re focused on responses and preparedness,\u201d he added.\n\nKeranen explained that another problem with using the war metaphor for a pandemic is that it reduces the complexity of the problem and focuses us solely on \u201cbeating\u201d the virus, without fully considering the factors that might have facilitated its proliferation \u2014 like deforestation and destroyed habitats that could contribute to future pandemics \u2014 or possible risk factors, such as poor air quality, that may make humans susceptible. \u201cIt really masks that broader ecological picture,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, everyone I spoke to while reporting this piece brought up the idea of ecology and microbiomes, not just as literal matters of concern with regard to the coronavirus but also as a strong metaphor for approaching the threat it poses to humans. Instead of thinking of this pandemic as a war \u2014 us versus them, humans versus invading virus \u2014 what if we reframed our thinking to imagine our goal as finding balance in not only the natural world, but in our social and cultural worlds as well?\n\nTheir suggestions made me think about The Biggest Little Farm, a 2019 documentary about the owners of a biodynamic family farm in California. Over an eight-year period, they came to see new pests or problems on the farm as evidence that something was out of balance, not simply an enemy to attack and destroy.\n\nJodie Nicotra, an associate professor at the University of Idaho, praised the ecological metaphor as a strong one. Nicotra is writing a book on the rhetorics of microbiome science. \u201cIn one of the Democratic debates, Bernie Sanders was asked how he would respond to the coronavirus situation,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe started by talking about universal health care. Joe Biden was like, \u2018We\u2019ll get the National Guard out and set up field hospitals,\u2019 and so on. There seemed to be more general praise for Biden\u2019s approach. But I think more ecological, community-based thinking \u2014 basically, the opposite of whatever we do now \u2014 would have probably prevented a lot of these issues.\u201d\n\nWhat an ecological metaphor offers that a war metaphor can\u2019t provide \u2014 due to its dependence on drawing a line between winners and losers, between us and the enemy \u2014 is what Nicotra calls the \u201cinvisible connections\u201d between things. \u201cYou don\u2019t see how vast economic inequality connects to a virus, but it does,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the webs of regulations and laws, or the production of equipment. You have to see that all of this stuff is bound up together and train yourself to see these connections between things.\u201d\n\nThere may be strength in a variety of metaphors\n\nIn truth, metaphors are inescapable. We\u2019re going to keep using them because they give us a way to imagine the world. They are a kind of grammar our brains rely on to operate. But that grammar is limiting nonetheless.\n\nWe\u2019re less limited in which metaphors we choose. And so, while the war metaphor may have some use, it would be wise for us to expand our thinking and the language we use to express it. There\u2019s no reason we have to stick to just one metaphor, regardless of what certain politicians might prefer.\n\n\u201cIf we take as a premise that we, as a culture, acknowledge a distributed expertise or set of solutions for dealing with something like this, then that kind of opens it up,\u201d Scott told me. \u201cThere are more groups, more people, more institutions to figure out responses. Those we thought of as experts at controlling risk haven\u2019t always been all that successful. We need alternative ways of thinking in response to these things.\u201d\n\nWe also need to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism when we\u2019re confronted with a particular metaphor every day. Is it the only way to address the issue at hand? Are we flattening the problem in ways that benefit some people over others, or that lead us toward harmful conclusions?\n\nWe can still use the language of chess, if it helps. But we shouldn\u2019t ignore the vast array of human experience just begging to be tapped to help us more thoroughly understand what the problem is and how we might solve it \u2014 even in a pandemic.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
