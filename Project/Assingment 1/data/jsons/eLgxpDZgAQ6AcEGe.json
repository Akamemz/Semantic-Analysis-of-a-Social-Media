    "content": "The Tuesday night before this past Thanksgiving , at a dinner in a small ballroom at the Holiday Inn at the airport in Des Moines , one of the 50 or so pastors who had come to listen to Marco Rubio stood up to ask him a question . Kenney Linhart , the broad-built boss of a nearby church called The Kathedral , had read about the complicated religious history of the Florida senator and Republican presidential hopeful . He needed a straight answer .\n\u201c You \u2019 re in a room full of Christians , \u201d Linhart said , wrapping his hand around the hand of the man holding the microphone , \u201c so you mentioned God , and you mentioned the king of kings , but tell us about your experience with the Lord Jesus Christ , using that name . \u201d\n\u201c Yes , sir , \u201d said Rubio , dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie , standing behind an unfussy hotel lectern .\nRubio has perhaps the most unusual personal religious story of anyone on the campaign trail . Given the audience , this might have been an opportunity for evasion , or to cherrypick parts of his \u201c faith journey \u201d that would appeal most to evangelicals . Instead , Rubio launched into a virtuoso , 10-minute-long , let-me-at-it telling of his circuitous faith\u2014Catholicism to Mormonism back to Catholicism to a Southern Baptist Convention-affiliated evangelical megachurch and finally back to Catholicism\u2014as well as passionate and particular evidence of the depth of his knowledge of the Bible . \u201c Now I sound like the preacher , \u201d a smiling Rubio said toward the end .\nHis answer was a big deal . It was watched , shared and talked about in churches around Iowa and among pastors around the country , and Linhart , who had supported Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal before that candidacy withered , heard what he needed to hear . He is now backing Rubio . \u201c I make it clear to my congregation : \u2018 I \u2019 m not going to tell you who to vote for , but this is who I \u2019 m supporting , \u2019 \u201d he said later when we talked on the phone .\nFor the staunchly Protestant evangelicals , though , who form a core component of the Iowa primary electorate , that answer also contained a poison pill . \u201c I \u2019 m fully , theologically , doctrinally aligned with the Roman Catholic Church , \u201d Rubio had said\u2014and for people like Joe Brown , the influential leader of the Marion Avenue Baptist Church in rural Washington in the southeastern part of the state , that no-wiggle-room declaration was a deal-breaker . \u201c Most pastors and evangelicals do not believe you can be a Catholic and be an evangelical at the same time , \u201d Brown told me . He is energetic in his support for Ted Cruz , the Texas senator and Rubio rival .\nMarco Rubio prays after an event in Iowa . His circuitous path to faith\u2014Catholicism to Mormonism back to Catholicism to a Southern Baptist Convention-affiliated evangelical megachurch and finally back to Catholicism\u2014has cost him many evangelical votes . | Eric Teetsel/ Rubio Campaign\nThe main knock on Rubio as a candidate is his slipperiness on issues like immigration . And when he talks in speeches , debates and town halls , he can come off polished to the point of rehearsed . His religion is an exception . When he talks about his faith , he sounds off-the-cuff sincere . Rubio pitches himself , too , as the most 21st-century candidate , and he means generationally ( he is only 44 ) and demographically ( the child of two Cuban immigrants , he would be the first Hispanic president ) \u2014but with Americans increasingly moving from church to church , blurring long-drawn lines between denominations , the single-most 21st-century thing about him might be his religious path .\nAnd yet in national polls , and in polls in Iowa , Rubio trails not only Cruz , the doctrinaire son of a Baptist pastor , but Donald Trump , the twice-divorced former casino tycoon who has said he doesn \u2019 t ask for forgiveness for his sins and who totes a Bible as a prop .\nThe problem here in Iowa , if it is a problem , with the kick-off caucuses a week and a half away , is not so much that Rubio is pandering for the votes of evangelicals . Or that he \u2019 s insufficiently authentic on this front . It \u2019 s that he \u2019 s entirely authentic . And it isn \u2019 t that he hasn \u2019 t \u201c picked \u201d a religion and stuck with it . For some , it \u2019 s that he has\u2014and that he \u201c picked \u201d wrong . In this state that skews conservative , white and old , the question is paramount , but it \u2019 s no less crucial across the rest of the country , where politics and religion combine in shifting , consequential ways .\nRubio , who has never lost an election , is manifestly ambitious , a baby-faced , step-skipping climber ever since he got on the city commission of the tiny municipality of West Miami when he was 26 years old . His religious life , on the other hand , stands apart . He has been a seeker and a searcher . He has struggled always , he has said , to balance what he wants in this life with what he wants from the next . But Rubio wants to be saved more than he wants to be president . And the former could cost him the latter .\nHe grew up west of Miami \u2019 s Little Havana down the street from a Catholic church where he was baptized and went to Mass with his mother , after which , he has said , he sometimes would wrap himself in a sheet and \u201c play priest \u201d by mimicking the services .\nWhen his family moved to North Las Vegas , in 1979 , they went to a Mormon church because of one of his aunts , and \u201c I immersed myself in LDS theology , \u201d Rubio wrote in his memoir \u201c and understood it as well as an eight-year-old mind can. \u201d His father didn \u2019 t much like the Mormon religion because of its bans on smoking ( he loved cigars ) and drinking ( he worked as a bartender ) and caffeine ( Cuban coffee ! ) .
