Party officials here and in Washington fear a repeat of the 2012 debacle in which it took officials days to count just 33,000 ballots and certify that Newt Gingrich finished second behind Mitt Romney .\nThe combination of a disorganized and underfunded state Republican Party , decentralized responsibility for reporting results and an electorate that has never seen a competitive presidential caucus has GOP officials bracing for logistical nightmares Tuesday .\nUnlike in Iowa , where the state parties recruited Microsoft to build a high-tech caucus results reporting system , or New Hampshire and South Carolina , where state elections officials conduct the primaries , in Nevada county GOP officials have responsibility for holding local caucuses , counting ballots and reporting results .\nHere in Clark County , which includes greater Las Vegas and 73 % of the state \u2019 s population , Republican volunteers at each of the 36 caucus locations will count ballots by hand , write the results on an envelope , take a photograph of the envelope and text the photo to Ed Williams , the Clark County Republican Party chairman , and to state GOP officials . The state party is also allowing the Associated Press to monitor the results as they come in from precincts ; in 2012 the party announced results itself on Twitter .\n\u201c The official number will be whatever is photographed , \u201d Mr. Williams said .\nThe new reporting method should be an improvement over 2012 , Mr. Williams said , when officials at some Las Vegas-area caucus sites packed ballots in their cars and drove them to the county party headquarters , where they were counted .\nAt the same time county officials elsewhere in the state emailed their results to state headquarters in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets\u2014but because many precincts had been recently renumbered , columns didn \u2019 t line up properly , forcing manual counting of the vote totals during the days after the caucuses .\nBefore any caucus votes are cast , senior Republicans in Washington are suggesting that if Nevada \u2019 s 2012 problems resurface , it will be at risk of losing its place in the front of the party \u2019 s presidential nominating calendar .\nThat \u201c puts a huge amount of pressure to get it right this time or lose their place in the rotation in the favored four states , \u201d said Ben Ginsberg , a longtime GOP election lawyer who worked for the George W. Bush and Mitt Romney campaigns .\nWhile expressing public optimism the caucus process will run smoothly , the leading campaigns here are preparing for the worst .\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2019 s campaign has instructed supporters to place their cellphones in the video mode as they enter caucus sites and record anything that looks suspicious , according to a person familiar with the matter .\nThe state party is so stretched for volunteers that it has asked elected officials to volunteer at some caucus sites .\n\u201c Most Nevadans have not been involved before , \u201c said Victoria Seaman , a Republican in the state assembly who agreed to volunteer at a caucus in her Las Vegas district . \u201d It \u2019 s going to be messy unless we get people to come out and that is why our team is asking us to get involved . It \u2019 s so confusing . \u201d\nRepublican National Committee officials , aiming to avoid a repeat of the 2012 embarrassment , are subsidizing a voter registration program , caucus trainings and a field staff of more than a dozen who will remain in place through the November general election .\n\u201c As with all of our state parties , the RNC is here to be a resource and provide support , \u201d said RNC spokeswoman Sara Sendek , who is handling press inquiries for the state party . \u201c But ultimately this is the Nevada Republican Party \u2019 s caucus where Republicans in Nevada will make their voices heard . \u201d\nThe RNC and 2016 presidential candidates are bankrolling the state party . Of the $ 429,521 the Nevada GOP raised during the last seven months of 2015 , more than half came in direct contributions from the Republican National Committee and the $ 12,500 filing fees presidential candidates paid to appear on the caucus ballot , according to campaign finance documents filed with the Nevada secretary of state \u2019 s office .\nAnother $ 50,000 came from Huntsman International , the company founded by Jon M. Huntsman Sr. , whose son was governor of Utah and ran for president in 2012 . Right to Rise PAC , the leadership political-action committee backing Jeb Bush \u2019 s campaign , gave the party $ 10,000 .\nNevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald didn \u2019 t respond to repeated messages left on his cellphone .\nTuesday \u2019 s caucuses will be just the third for Republicans since Nevada moved close to the front of the presidential nominating calendar . In both 2008 and 2012 Mr. Romney , powered by support from the state \u2019 s Mormon population , won with twice as much support as the second-place candidates .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a natural course of politics as usual and voting as usual as everybody \u2019 s used to here , \u201d said James Smack , a former Nevada GOP chairman . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be scratchy no matter what . We \u2019 re not like Iowa , where people have been doing this since the dawn of time . \u201d\nThere is plenty of opportunity for confusion . Not all of the state \u2019 s caucuses start at the same time . Some start at 5 p.m. local time , others an hour later . In Clark County voting must be complete by 8:30 p.m. , to give officials a head start counting ballots . Other parts of the state will allow voting until 9 p.m .\nUnlike Nevada Democrats , Republicans here forbid same-day caucus registration , a practice that has been a boon for the state \u2019 s Democratic registration but has been rebuffed by Republicans fearful of voter fraud .\nThe state GOP set a Feb. 13 deadline to register with the party to participate in the caucuses . By contrast , Iowa Republicans allowed caucus-goers to register on site at the state \u2019 s Feb. 1 contest . About 10 % of the state \u2019 s 170,000 caucus-goers registered on site the day of the caucuses , according to Iowa GOP spokesman Charlie Szold .\nRyan Erwin , the Nevada director for Jeb Bush \u2019 s campaign , said there is \u201c room for chaos \u201d in the state \u2019 s caucus process and predicted a messy outcome no matter what happens . \u201c This is the home of the conspiracy theory , \u201d Mr. Erwin said .\nThe assumption from political professionals here is that Donald Trump will do very well , but there is no reliable public polling of Nevada and the state party didn \u2019 t maintain a list of 2012 caucus-goers , so there is no way for campaigns or pollsters to target people most likely to caucus .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the state party has a great organization , \u201d said Sig Rogich , a Las Vegas marketing official who was the chief media adviser for the 1988 and 1992 George H.W . Bush presidential campaigns . \u201c There \u2019 s been no outreach from the state party.\u2026It \u2019 s confusing to people , where to go , how to get there . They don \u2019 t know how it works . \u201d\nTurnout is expected to be very small , about 10 % to 15 % of the state \u2019 s 400,000 registered Republicans . About 44,000 people voted in the state \u2019 s 2008 caucuses and the total dropped by a quarter four years later . Even the most optimistic Nevada GOP scenarios envision turnout to be far less than the 65,000 people who voted in last week \u2019 s primary for mayor of Milwaukee .\n\u201c There \u2019 s still a good deal of confusion on the part of the general public on how it works , \u201d said former Nevada Gov . Bob List . \u201c We really should have a primary here so that everyone can participate in a reasonable way . \u201d",
