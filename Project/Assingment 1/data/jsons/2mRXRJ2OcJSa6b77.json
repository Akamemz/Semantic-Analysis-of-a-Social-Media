( Jim Urquhart/Reuters )\nIf he wants the GOP to win the midterms , Trump should embrace every viable Republican candidate , regardless of past feuds .\nOn Monday , President Trump offered an enthusiastic endorsement of Mitt Romney \u2019 s candidacy for the U.S. Senate , after the 2012 GOP presidential nominee announced that he would run for the seat of retiring longtime Utah senator Orrin Hatch :\n. @ MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah . He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @ OrrinHatch , and has my full support and endorsement ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 20 , 2018\nRomney and Trump have something of a complicated history \u2014 especially over the last two years \u2014 which makes the president \u2019 s quick and effusive backing somewhat of a surprise . But it \u2019 s a surprise that the president should endeavor to repeat throughout the midterm elections if he hopes to bolster his first term with any legislative achievements beyond tax reform .\nThe presidential tweet \u2019 s conciliatory tone is an unfamiliar one , especially in light of Romney \u2019 s sustained public opposition to Trump \u2019 s candidacy in 2016 . In March of that year , Romney delivered a major speech urging Republicans to vote strategically in order to deny Trump an outright majority of delegates heading into the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , which would have opened the possibility of a non-Trump compromise candidate winning the Republican nomination . Unlike many leaders on the right , who slowly came to embrace the unconventional candidate , Romney persisted in vocally opposing Trump even after he had secured the nomination .\nIn May of 2016 \u2014 after Trump had won the Indiana primary and all but locked up the nomination \u2014 Romney explained his rationale in steadfastly opposing the GOP nominee to the Wall Street Journal :\nI wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn \u2019 t ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing , which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world . . . . I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak , but that \u2019 s how I can sleep at night .\nRomney went on to skip July \u2019 s Republican National Convention . Later , he denounced Trump \u2019 s comments on the infamous Access Hollywood tape that emerged just a month before the November election .\nAll of this makes Trump \u2019 s immediate support for Romney \u2019 s Senate campaign fairly puzzling . Trump has never been known for receiving public criticism with grace \u2014 whether those volleys come from perceived enemies on the left or would-be allies on the right . Despite being the standard bearer of the GOP in 2016 , Trump often refused to support the Senate campaigns of Republicans who didn \u2019 t embrace his own candidacy as enthusiastically as he wished . Indeed , in the weeks before his inauguration , some speculated that Trump had entertained the possibility of Romney \u2019 s nomination as secretary of state \u2014 only to spurn him and choose Rex Tillerson \u2014 as a way to exact revenge for Romney \u2019 s failure to endorse his candidacy .\nIn fact , both during and after the 2016 elections , Trump appeared to revel in attacking Republicans who expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership of the GOP . The laundry list of Trump \u2019 s rhetorical onslaughts against members of his own party has grown too lengthy to explore in great detail , but no Republican daring enough to criticize him has been left unscathed \u2014 and that includes Romney , whom Trump personally attacked on over a dozen occasions during the course of 2016 alone .\nRepublican Senate candidates \u2019 lack of gusto for Trump \u2019 s campaign , however , didn \u2019 t end up being terribly detrimental to them in the 2016 elections \u2014 at least , not as detrimental as hardcore Trump supporters insisted it would be .
