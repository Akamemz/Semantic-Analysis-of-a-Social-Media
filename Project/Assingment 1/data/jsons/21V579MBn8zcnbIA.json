    "content": "Hillary Clinton sat down Friday for a rare national television interview , a move that could have allowed her to sail into the holiday weekend , reclaiming a bad week of headlines about the vexing email scandal that has overshadowed her campaign and unsettled even ardent supporters .\nDuring the sitdown with MSNBC 's Andrea Mitchell -- replete with gauzy lighting -- Clinton mostly made news for refusing to directly apologize for her exclusive use of a private email account and server while she was serving as secretary of state .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t the best choice , \u201d Clinton conceded to Mitchell , who asked multiple times whether she was sorry . Clinton repeated that her \u201c personal email use was fully above board . ''\nClinton then did utter the word `` sorry , '' but seemed to turn the blame on others for not understanding the ins and outs of the scandal .\n\u201c I disagree with the choice that I made , \u201d she explained . \u201c At the end of the day , I am sorry that this has been confusing to people . ''\nThat answer is one Clinton repeatedly alludes to on the campaign trail . And , over the course of the 30-minute interview , conducted before a campaign stop in San Juan , Puerto Rico , the Democratic front-runner made it clear that she takes responsibility for her arrangement \u2014 but that she does not intend to start presenting a new explanation or response anytime soon .\nInstead , Clinton nodded to a hope that her campaign and its donors have been chattering about for weeks : that her Oct. 22 testimony in front of the House Committee investigating Benghazi will let her more effectively move past the email questions .\n\u201c I am very confident that by the time this campaign has run its course , people will know that what I \u2019 ve been saying is accurate and that I will have a chance to do that before the entire world , \u201d she said of her upcoming Capitol Hill appearance .\nClinton \u2019 s backers expect that Republicans will go too far and make the session look like a partisan spectacle , allowing the former secretary of state to gain control of the national conversation in a way that she has been unable to do since launching her campaign in April .\nBut that may be wishful thinking . Clinton will still likely have to contend with Foggy Bottom \u2019 s monthly email release until January \u2014 right before the Iowa caucuses , her campaign is constantly fending off questions about her former staffers \u2019 own testimony , and an FBI investigation into whether any sensitive material was mishandled appears to be in early stages .\nThis week underscored the threat , with Monday delivering headlines that dozens more of Clinton 's emails had been deemed classified , as State Department readied its largest release to date of her messages . The end of the week was n't much better -- longtime Clinton confidant and chief of staff Cheryl Mills went before the committee behind closed doors on Thursday , for example , just hours after news broke that another of Clinton \u2019 s one-time aides , Bryan Pagliano , would plead the Fifth and refuse to answer questions when it came time for his own appearance .\nIt was just another week in the ever-evolving saga of Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nThis constant flow of new developments has underpinned a steep drop in Clinton \u2019 s trustworthiness and favorability ratings while she pursues the Democratic nomination , and her campaign 's chairman John Podesta conceded to reporters on Thursday that the campaign had faced \u201c headwinds , especially around the email question . ''\nAnd during Friday 's interview \u2014 just the candidate \u2019 s third nationally televised Q+A \u2014 Clinton admitted that she was unhappy with the results of a recent Quinnipiac poll that showed the top word associated with her was \u201c liar , '' followed by \u201c dishonest . \u201d\n\u201c Well it certainly doesn \u2019 t make me feel good , \u201d Clinton said .\nNonetheless , she showed no signs of publicly changing course on Friday , even while donors and high-profile backers have publicly and privately questioned the campaign \u2019 s response to the questions .\nTop campaign officials summoned the team \u2019 s highest-level fundraisers to campaign headquarters in Brooklyn on Thursday , largely with the goal of calming any hand-wringing and updating the group on Clinton \u2019 s email response plan .\n\u201c I feel that I have questions to answer , which I intend to do at every turn with you and others , about the whole email issue , \u201d Clinton told Mitchell . \u201c And to keep saying the same thing . ''\nPolitical considerations aside , the candidate was also careful to defend the process by which she turned over her emails for scrutiny , insisting that she had been \u201c as transparent as I could , \u201d though she reiterated her common refrain that she wants the State Department to release her emails sooner .\nAnd in response to concerns about whether she inapporpriately shared classified information , Clinton insisted she takes \u201c classified material very , very seriously , \u201d noting that she never sent any material marked classified over her private server .\nAnyway , she said , she did not give much thought to setting up that server , in the first place .\n\u201c I was not thinking a lot when I got in [ to the State Department ] , there was so much work to be done , \u201d she said . \u201c I didn \u2019 t really stop and think [ about ] what kind of email system there will be . ''\nWhile the email issue has dominated headlines on the Democratic side of the aisle , Clinton \u2019 s conversation with Mitchell also touched on Donald Trump , who is dominating the GOP polls and whose campaign has upended the national political conversation .\nClinton , no fan of the New York billionaire 's despite attending his third wedding in 2005 , called his candidacy \u201c a bad development for our political system .
