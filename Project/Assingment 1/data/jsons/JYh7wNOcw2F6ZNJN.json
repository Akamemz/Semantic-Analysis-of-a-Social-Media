Bold new reforms are needed to unleash the potential of the American people and expand opportunities for everyone , and the House of Representatives continues to lead the way , '' he said.Boehner said the Republican budget addresses the problem of spending head-on while also protecting programs like Medicare and Social Security.The House he said also voted overwhelmingly to replace Medicare 's Sustainable Growth Rate ( SGR ) formula for a system that rewards quality and innovation . `` This permanent SGR solution is a big win for the American people and represents the first real entitlement reform in decades . It will help ensure that seniors have access to their doctor , put in place a stronger Medicare program to aid every American trying to care for elderly parents , and provide hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of durable savings for taxpayers over the long term , '' he said.He concluded by saying : `` In the House of Representatives , we 've had a strong first 100 days of 2015 , and we 're just getting started . We 'll continue to listen to the American people and do what 's right for the country , not what 's easy . ''",
