So first of all , kudos to him . ''\nKirby continued , calling Rosen `` a journalist I have great respect for , so I thank him for that . ''\nOnce presented with the facts of the deleted video excerpt , which featured Rosen asking then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki about the Iran negotiations on Dec. 2 , 2013 , Kirby said the department `` took it seriously '' and looked into the matter . `` Another thing , I did n't say yesterday that everything was over . I said that we looked at this , '' Kirby said , emphasizing that if more details come to light , those would factor into any further investigation .\nPsaki , now White House communications director , tweeted Wednesday that she `` had no knowledge of , nor would I have approved of , any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @ StateDept ''\nKirby also flatly rejected the notion that there is a `` cover-up '' at Foggy Bottom .\nRichard Grenell , a former U.S. spokesman to the United Nations and current Fox contributor , appeared earlier on the same program and suggested that there is `` a cover-up going on right now , '' which Kirby strongly contested .\n`` No , there 's no cover-up . Not at all , '' Kirby responded . `` And I think you guys know me well enough to know that I would never abide by any such thing . As I said , we interviewed this individual . We tried to find out what happened . Where I am now is where I was yesterday . We just do n't know who made the request and why . But if additional information were to come to life that would change our finding , I would look at it deeper . ''\nThe spokesman also noted that the edited video was only on State 's YouTube channel , remarking that a full , unedited version was always available `` on another official website , the defense video information website as well as the transcript \u2014 the written transcript was never edited . ''\n\u201c So the only one that was \u2014 I 'm not mitigating or making excuses , but the one that was edited was the one that went on that YouTube channel , '' he said .\nAsked whether more videos could have been similarly edited during Psaki 's tenure , Kirby replied , `` The short answer to your question is , I do n't know . ''\n`` And I do n't know that there 's any way I can know . I just do n't have the time or the resources or the manpower to go back and look at every single press briefing over the last three or four years , '' he said . `` And I do n't know that 's a useful use of taxpayer dollars . What I can tell you is , I 'm focused on going forward . And going forward we 're going to make sure that this kind of thing can never happen again .",
