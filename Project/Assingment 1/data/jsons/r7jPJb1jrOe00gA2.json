    "content": "CHARLESTON , S.C.\u2014Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton put rival Bernie Sanders on the defensive Sunday over health care and gun control , in a series of sharp exchanges during their final debate before voting for the presidential nominations begins in Iowa .\nMrs. Clinton argued Mr. Sanders has been weak on gun restrictions and that his health-care plan would be a mistake because it would require starting over after a long , contentious national debate on the issue . Mr. Sanders , who modified his positions on those areas over the weekend , was forced to defend himself on both fronts .\n\u201c We finally have a path to universal health care , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said . \u201c To tear it up and start over again , pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate , I think is the wrong direction . \u201d\nThe pair also clashed over Wall Street regulation , with Mr. Sanders charging that Mrs. Clinton has taken too much money from the financial sector in speaking fees and campaign contributions to impose tough rules .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t take money from the banks , \u201d Mr. Sanders said . \u201c I don \u2019 t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs . \u201d\nThe debate , their fourth , showcased some of the sharpest exchanges between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders since polls have tightened in early primary states . While the former secretary of state leads in national polls , Mr. Sanders appears to have a lead in New Hampshire and is tightening the gap in Iowa .\nMr. Sanders used the event to hammer his campaign themes on the influence of billionaires and big-money donors in Washington , saying he seeks to stir a \u201c political revolution \u201d that would transform politics . Mrs. Clinton sought to showcase her experience and pragmatic approach to governing , particularly in divided government .\nOn other issues , such as national security , how to battle drug addiction , overhauling the criminal-justice system and climate change , the pair largely agreed , as did former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley , who is running far behind the other two .\nMrs. Clinton sought to turn the attack back on Mr. Sanders by noting that President Barack Obama , who also received Wall Street backing and who remains highly popular with Democratic voters , signed into law the Dodd-Frank regulatory bill that imposed new restrictions on the banking and investment industries .\nThe harshest exchanges Sunday , as on the campaign trail in recent days , were over health care , and Mr. Sanders \u2019 s plan for a single-payer national health-care plan . Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s argument against his plan was essentially a political one : it isn \u2019 t smart , she said , to start over again at a time when the Affordable Care Act remains under attack from Republicans .\nShe noted that even during the 2009-10 health-care debate , when Democrats had large majorities in both houses of Congress , there wasn \u2019 t sufficient support for a public option to compete with private health-insurance plans .\n\u201c Even with the Democrats in charge of the Congress , we couldn \u2019 t get the votes for that , \u201d she said .\nMr. Sanders said his plan is the better one because it would cover all Americans , which he said the existing law fails to do . He also pushed back against Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s charges that he would unravel existing health-care programs .\n\u201c What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man , woman and child as a right , \u201d he said .\nTwo hours before the debate and under pressure , Mr. Sanders explained how he would pay for his plan , including a 2.2 % income tax on all families and a 6.2 % payroll tax paid by employers . He said this doesn \u2019 t count as a new tax on the middle class because the savings that come from no longer paying premiums are much bigger than the new taxes .\n\u201c It \u2019 s one thing to say I \u2019 m raising taxes . It \u2019 s another thing to say we are doing away with private health-insurance premiums , \u201d he said . \u201c In total , there are huge savings in what your family is spending . \u201d\nOn Sunday , Mr. Sanders also abandoned a previous version of his plan , which directed states to administer the health program . Mrs. Clinton sought to use his last-minute announcements as evidence of inconsistency on his part .\n\u201c I have to say , I \u2019 m not sure whether we \u2019 re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight , or we \u2019 re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress , \u201d she said .\nWhen given a chance to make a character attack , Mr. Sanders bristled . Asked to defend his past characterization of former President Bill Clinton \u2019 s personal transgressions as \u201c disgraceful and unacceptable , \u201d he said the question from moderator Andrea Mitchell annoyed him .\nThe Vermont senator said he has run an issue-oriented campaign and has resisted pressure to go on the attack , but he was asked a direct question about the former president .\n\u201c Yes , his behavior was deplorable , \u201d Mr. Sanders said of Mr. Clinton , who admitted to having an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern . \u201c Have I ever once said a word about that issue ? No , I have not . I \u2019 m going to debate Secretary Clinton and Gov . O \u2019 Malley on the issues facing the American people\u2014not Bill Clinton \u2019 s personal behavior . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton was also on the offense on the issue of gun restrictions , one of the few areas where her record is to the left of Mr. Sanders .\nShe has been criticizing him for weeks on the issue , in particular his support for legislation that provided immunity to gun manufactures , something other industries don \u2019 t enjoy .\n\u201c He has voted with the NRA , with the gun lobby numerous times , \u201d she said , ticking off a string of pro-gun votes , including allowing guns in national parks and on Amtrak trains .\nMr. Sanders pointed to other restrictions that he has supported and said his vote for the immunity legislation was meant to protect a \u201c small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to someone , \u201d who shouldn \u2019 t be held liable if someone then commits a crime .\n\u201c What I said is , \u2018 I would re-look at it. \u2019 We are going to re-look at it and I will support stronger provisions , \u201d he said .\nMr. Sanders also found himself explaining his socialist pedigree . Moderator Lester Holt asked how he would win the Democratic nomination calling himself a democratic socialist who , for much of his career , spoke dismissively about the party he now seeks to lead .\nMr. Sanders said the party \u201c needs major reform. \u201d He also said he would try to rejuvenate the party by building the Democratic apparatus in all 50 states , recruiting small donors and ending the party \u2019 s reliance on funding from super PACs .\nMrs. Clinton noted that in 2011 Mr. Sanders said he wanted to see Mr. Obama face a primary challenge in his re-election bid because he wasn \u2019 t liberal enough .\nWhen asked how he \u2019 d build support among minorities , which Mrs. Clinton is winning by wide margins , Mr. Sanders said African-American voters will support him once they become more familiar with his record , agenda and views on the economy . \u201c We have the momentum , we \u2019 re on a path to a victory , \u201d he said .\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders offered different prescriptions for making Washington work , though both vowed to push past the gridlock that has frustrated Mr. Obama .\nMrs. Clinton touted her willingness to meet and work with Republicans during her time as first lady , as a U.S. senator from New York and as Mr. Obama \u2019 s secretary of state .\n\u201c I will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground , \u201d she said . \u201c I know it \u2019 s hard , but I also know you \u2019 ve got to work at it every single day . \u201d\nMr. Sanders said the problem is n't that Republicans and Democrats hate each other . \u201c The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We need new leadership , \u201d said Mr. O \u2019 Malley , promising to build on Mr. Obama \u2019 s work . \u201c That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m running for president . I need your help , I ask for your vote . \u201d\nThe Vermont senator pointed to lawmakers \u2019 inaction on issues such as raising the minimum wage and repairing crumbling infrastructure , saying that his objective is to make Congress respond and reflect the will of the people instead of moneyed special interests .",
