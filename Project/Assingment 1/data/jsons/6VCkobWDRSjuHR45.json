    "content": "I figured I 'd expand an update from my previous post into a more developed discussion about the tidal wave of insufferable speculation we are about to endure over the next 70 hours or so . As I wrote , the hotly-anticipated Obamacare ruling will be handed down on Thursday morning . Based on the pattern and seniority of the justices who have authored majority opinions so far this term , many long-time Court watchers are nearly certain that Chief Justice John Roberts will exercise his prerogative to write the healthcare landmark decision . ( Point of clarification : the Chief Justice is automatically considered the `` most senior '' jurist on the bench , even if he or she has n't served the longest ) . Ed Morrissey , speaking for many , opines that this ( yet unconfirmed ) development `` sounds like a big loss for the White House . '' Ed is hardly alone in embracing that calculus :\nRT @ PhilipAKlein : Ex-SCOTUS clerk Sen. Lee tells me if Roberts is writing decision it is `` substantially '' more likely mandate is toast .\nWith all due deference to the estimable junior Senator from Utah , everyone needs to slow down . Of course it 's possible that Roberts , a Bush appointee , will take the lead in striking down Obamacare 's individual mandate -- or maybe even the entire law . It 's also entirely conceivable that if a majority voted to uphold the law in private , Roberts decided to assert his leadership by writing the decision himself . In doing so , he would take additional ownership of `` The Roberts Court , '' and could manage the newly-established precedent as he sees fit . This could mean trying to `` limit the damage , '' so to speak , perhaps by attempting to offer some concrete limiting principles that would help prevent future Congresses from abusing the expanded interstate commerce precedent . I can imagine a scenrio in which Roberts writes a 5-4 opinion invalidating Obamacare and/or the mandate , but I can similarly envision him leading a 6-3 majority to uphold . My point is that if Roberts is indeed the author of the Obamacare ruling , that fact alone offers zero dispositive proof of anything at all . If you 're yearning for a dose of optimism , go back and read Phil Klein 's analysis of Roberts ' contributions to the oral arguments over the individual mandate :\nThose who say that Roberts ' vote is in play point out that he asked critical questions to both sides . But a closer look reveals that when he was badgering President Obama 's solicitor general Donald Verrilli , he was speaking for himself , but when pressing lawyers opposing the law -- Paul Clement and Mike Carvin -- he created distance from the position by noting he was articulating the position of the government . There are a number of examples of him forcefully challenging the Obama administration 's key arguments , using such phrases as `` it seems to me '' ... He continued on that point to say , `` what I 'm concerned about is , once we accept the principle that everybody is in this market , I do n't see why Congress 's power is limited to regulating the method of payment ... as it does in any other area . What other area have we said Congress can regulate this market but only with respect to prices , but only with respect to means of travel ? No . Once you 're -- once you 're in the interstate commerce and can regulate it , pretty much all bets are off . ''\nOn the other hand , as I also pointed out earlier , oral arguments Are . Not .
