Protectionism is , in fact , the real American way .\nAs Lincoln declared , \u201c Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth. \u201d Lincoln warned that \u201c the abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government\u2026 must produce want and ruin among our people . \u201d\nIn 1816 , Thomas Jefferson wrote , \u201c manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort\u2026 keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained , without regard to difference of price . \u201d\nIn 1832 , the Great Compromiser , Henry Clay , was vocal about his disdain for \u201c free traders \u201d : \u201c It is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance .

Protection is but the law of nature , the law of self-preservation , of self-development , of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man , \u201d said Republican President William McKinley . \u201c [ Free trade ] destroys the dignity and independence of American labor\u2026 It will take away from the people of this country who work for a living\u2014 and the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces\u2014 it will take from them heart and home and hope .

Today \u2019 s Republican free traders are the champions of Clinton \u2019 s trade legacy \u2014 NAFTA , the WTO , and China \u2019 s entrance into the WTO .\nIf the founders had desired the dissolution of sovereignty and creation of international dependence guaranteed by organizations like the WTO or the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission , it is perhaps unlikely they would have ever fought for independence in the first place . As Jackson said while discussing his support for trade protections : \u201c If our liberty and republican form of government , procured for us by our revolutionary fathers , are worth the blood and treasure at which they were obtained , it surely is our duty to protect and defend them . \u201d\nPrestowitz says that the new consensus of trade globalism has now become so dominant that we \u2019 ve been led \u201c to assume our current economic orthodoxy is the \u2018 American Way. \u2019 Nothing could be further from the truth . In fact , it is a reversal of the doctrine of national economic development that made us the richest country on earth . \u201d\nConsider the recent comments of talk radio host Mark Levin as an example of the transmogrification of the Republican worldview on this issue . Mr. Levin recently suggested that the dangers of tariffs and protectionism are axiomatic \u2014 \u201c It \u2019 s been tried and it \u2019 s failed miserably\u2026 It \u2019 s a fact\u2026 for me , it \u2019 s an open and shut case\u2026 it \u2019 s a disaster . I know it . \u201d\nDuring earlier times in our history , prominent political and business leaders spoke out against such free trade dogmatism . As Jefferson wrote in explaining why his views had evolved to favor more protectionist policies : \u201c In so complicated a science as political economy , no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances , and for their contraries . \u201d\nIn 1875 , Joseph Wharton \u2014 the steel industrialist who founded the nation \u2019 s first business school and Trump \u2019 s alma mater , the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 was more blunt in expressing his disdain for such religious free traders :\n[ They ] assum [ e ] for their dogmas an infallibility as absolute as that claimed by the Pope for his dicta\u2026 and preaching everywhere the superior claims of their strange creed over the mere bonds of patriotism so that the revenues , development , and the existence of States are to perish in order that their fungus , Trade Philanthropy , may fatten for a while upon the decay , these verbose prophets of the new philosophy have become a nuisance and a source of infection which healthy political organisms can hardly afford to tolerate .\nBeginning with Alexander Hamilton \u2019 s proposals for the industrial and technological development of the United States through use of subsidies , tariffs and patents , U.S. leaders pursued the \u201c American System \u201d of government-business partnership for national development of things like the Erie Canal , the telegraph , the transcontinental railroad , the aircraft industry , the RCA company founded by the U.S. Navy , and much more\u2026 [ The American System ] consisted of government policies and programs aimed at developing advanced infrastructure and protecting and subsidizing development of intellectual property and manufacturing industries .\n\u201c This , of course , was antithetical to the free-market , laissez-faire policies , \u201d which Great Britain \u2014 and eventually the U.S. \u2014 would come to adopt .\nIndeed , Henry Clay , the foremost proponent of the American System , made clear that ideological \u201c free trade \u201d was the American System \u2019 s antithesis :\nWhen gentlemen have succeeded in their design of an immediate or gradual destruction of the American System , what is their substitute ? Free trade ! Free trade ! The call for free trade is as unavailing as the cry of a spoiled child , in its nurse \u2019 s arms , for the moon , or the stars that glitter in the firmament of heaven . It never has existed ; it never will exist . Trade implies , at least two parties . To be free , it should be fair , equal and reciprocal .\nMany of the founders demonstrated commitment to promoting American manufacturing .\nAt his inauguration , George Washington is said to have spurned the fashion of his day \u2014 opting not to wear an elegant suit from Europe but instead a woolen suit made of cloth woven at the Hartford Woolen Manufactory in Connecticut . \u201c I hope it will not be a great while , before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress , \u201d Washington wrote in 1789 .\n\u201c I use no porter or cheese in my family , but such as is made in America , \u201d Washington wrote , boasting that these domestic products are \u201c of an excellent quality . \u201d\nOne of the first acts of Congress Washington signed was a tariff among whose stated purpose was \u201c the encouragement and protection of manufactures . \u201d\nPrestowitz further explains that in his 1791 Report on Manufactures , Alexander Hamilton , our nation \u2019 s first Secretary of Treasury , laid out a proposal that followed the \u201c English mercantilist model closely \u201d by calling for high tariffs to protect nascent American industry , supporting agriculture to encourage more exports , promoting \u201c Buy American \u201d policies and allocating federal funds for transit systems to facilitate commerce such as roads , bridges , and harbors .\nFletcher notes that \u201c Hamilton \u2019 s policies were not adopted in toto right away. \u201d It took the War of 1812 and witnessing Great Britain \u2019 s abusive trading practices \u201c to push America firmly into the protectionist camp . \u201d\nWhile some founders were less protectionist than Hamilton , they were far more protectionist than today \u2019 s free traders . Indeed , the extent to which there was disagreement amongst the founders did not come close the chasm that exists today between the Paul Ryan , Wall Street Journal , Mark Levin \u201c free traders \u201d versus Pat Buchanan \u201c protectionists. \u201d Rather , their disagreements represented comparatively minor shades of variation between two schools of thought \u2014 both of which would today be regarded as protectionist .\nGiven the objections to Britain \u2019 s trading practices and the belief that trade needs to be \u201c equal and reciprocal , \u201d it seems unlikely the founders would support what former Nucor Steel chairman has described as the \u201c unilateral trade disarmament \u201d of our policies today .\nHenry Clay explained that \u201c equal and reciprocal \u201d free trade \u201c never has existed ; [ and ] it never will exist. \u201d He warned against practicing \u201c romantic trade philanthropy\u2026 which invokes us to continue to purchase the produce of foreign industry , without regard to the state or prosperity of our own. \u201d Clay made clear that he was \u201c utterly and irreconcilably opposed \u201d to trade which would \u201c throw wide open our ports to foreign productions \u201d without reciprocation .\nIn 1822 , President Monroe observed that \u201c whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce , \u201d the conditions necessary for its success \u2014 reciprocity and international peace \u2014 \u201c has never occurred and can not be expected. \u201d Monroe said , \u201c strong reasons\u2026 impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures . \u201d\nLikewise , in 1819 John Adams noted that he did not live in a world in which \u201c all the nations of the earth \u201d had adopted \u201c the abolition of all restrictive , exclusive , and monopolizing laws. \u201d Adams concluded that while foreign nations \u201c preserve in cherishing such laws\u2026 I know not how we can do ourselves justice without introducing\u2026 some portions of the same system . \u201d\nIn an 1816 letter , Jefferson , an agrarian who had originally been more supportive of \u201c free trade , \u201d expressed vexation that free traders attempted to use his earlier writings to promote their ideological agenda .\nYou tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures . There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor , but within the thirty years which have since elapsed , how are circumstances changed ! [ \u2026 ] [ He ] who is now against domestic manufacture must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation , or to be clothed in skins , and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns . I am not one of these . Experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort .\nJefferson blasted the free traders who use his former opinion on trade \u201c only as a stalking horse , to cover their disloyal propensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly people . \u201d\nYet today religious free traders continue to use the founders \u2019 legacy to promote their agenda . Indeed , compare the words of our founders and early Republican presidents to those of today \u2019 s conservative commentariat . This tension is perhaps best exemplified by Mark Levin , who has branded himself a constitutional scholar and \u201c constitutional conservative . \u201d\nIn a recent segment , Levin bizarrely suggests that the bureaucracy necessary for implementing Trump \u2019 s \u201c protectionism \u201d would go far beyond the scope of limited government envisioned by our founders :\nNotice there \u2019 s never any discussion about the massive bureaucracy that \u2019 s going to be necessary if we have massive tariffs and protectionism \u2014 the power of the central government outside the constitution controlling\u2026 the movement of goods and services .\nHowever , Lincoln would seem to disagree and argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation :\nThe tariff is the cheaper system , because the duties , being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points , will require comparatively few officers in their collection ; while by the direct tax system , the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors , going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts , devouring every blade of grass and other green thing .\nCuriously , anti-tariff purists seem to favor a taxation model that is the exact inversion of the founder \u2019 s model \u2014 i.e . where income , consumption or sales are directly taxed , but imports are not . Yet this policy , however , would likely only have the effect of incentivizing people involved in production to shift that production overseas . Levin similarly suggests that unrestricted free trade is a necessity :\nLadies and gentlemen , I want you to look around your homes , I want you to look at your automobile in many cases . We kind of need trade , don \u2019 t we ? Otherwise why are you buying all of these things ?\nHowever , in 1775 , John Adams posed Levin \u2019 s same question and arrived at the exact opposite conclusion of the \u201c Liberty \u2019 s Voice \u201d host .\n\u201c Can The Inhabitants of North America live without foreign Trade ? \u201d Adams asked .\nAnswering his own question , Adams concluded : \u201c We must at first indeed sacrifice some of our appetites coffee , wine , punch , sugar , molasses\u2026 and our dress would not be so elegant\u2026 But these are trifles in a contest for Liberty . \u201d\nLevin has said he opposes Trump \u2019 s protectionism because it will create higher prices for consumers :\nA tariff is really just a tax\u2026 imposed on the American people\u2026 While Trump and his surrogates may have the money to pay the higher prices his policies would cause , many Americans \u2013 who are already having difficulty making ends meet \u2013 do not .\nHowever , in a declaration that would seem to apply to our relationship with China today , Adams warned against the allure of cheap foreign goods that result from illicit trading practices :\n[ British manufactures ] disgorged upon us all their stores of merchandise and manufactures , not only without profit , but at certain loss for a time\u2026 The cheapness of these articles allures us into extravagance and luxury , involves us in debt , exhausts our resources , and at length produces universal complaint .\nRepublican President McKinley rejected the \u201c cheaper is better \u201d argument outright : \u201c They [ free traders ] say , \u2018 Buy where you can buy the cheapest. \u2019 That is one of their maxims\u2026 Of course , that applies to labor as to everything else . Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that , and it is the protection maxim : \u2018 Buy where you can pay the easiest. \u2019 And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards . \u201d\nThey say , if you had not the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper . Well , whether a thing is cheap or whether it is dear depends on what we can earn by our daily labor . Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer . Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer .\nAdditionally , Hamilton and Lincoln argued that based on economies of scale , any temporary increase in costs resulting from a tariff would eventually decrease as the domestic manufacturer produced more .\nHamilton explained that despite an initial \u201c increase of price \u201d caused by regulations that control foreign competition , once a \u201c domestic manufacture has attained to perfection\u2026 it invariably becomes cheaper . \u201d\nLincoln similarly said that , \u201c if a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article \u201d that could be produced domestically , \u201c at no distant day , in consequence of such duty , \u201d the domestic article \u201c will be sold to our people cheaper than before . \u201d\nUnlike Levin , Lincoln did not see a tariff as a tax on low-income Americans because it would only burden the consumer according to the amount the consumer consumed .\nBy the tariff system , the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods\u2026 the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few , while the substantial and laboring many who live at home , and upon home products , go entirely free .\nLevin argues that adopting protectionist policies to defend America \u2019 s industrial independence is not conservative . \u201c What I see developing is not a conservative coalition , but a coalition on the Republican side of big government advocates , \u201d Levin said . \u201c The Republican Party now is a party of the progressive Republicans . Theodore Roosevelt\u2026 the protectionists , Ross Perot , Pat Buchanan , the No-Growthers . \u201d\nHowever , contrary to Levin \u2019 s suggestion , from 1871 to 1913 under the leadership of mostly Republican presidents , \u201c the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [ and ] gross national product ( GNP ) grew 4.3 percent annually , twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century , \u201d notes Alfred Eckes Jr. , chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan .\nMoreover , contrary to Levin \u2019 s telling of history , defending the American worker through trade protectionism was a priority of the original Republican Party . Free trade was the policy of Democrats . As Ian Fletcher has observed , \u201c reading the speech of 19th-century Republican politicians today , with their expressions of concern for the wages of the American working man , one finds oneself wondering how the party slipped to its present day let-them-eat-cake position. \u201d The Party of Lincoln had always been the Party of Protectionism . Indeed , Fletcher notes that Lincoln \u2019 s number two issue after slavery was the tariff .\nIn 1896 , the GOP platform pledged to \u201c renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection , as the bulwark of American industrial independence , and the foundation of development and prosperity . This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry . It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods ; it secures the American market for the American producer . It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman . \u201d\nIn fact , the GOP \u2019 s original view on trade seemed guided by the same \u201c America First \u201d principle articulated by Donald Trump .\nAs Whig representative and later Republican senator , Justin Morrill explained during an 1857 tariff debate : \u201c I am ruling America for the benefit , first , of Americans , and for the \u2018 rest of mankind \u2019 afterwards . \u201d\nMorrill attacked free trade \u201c devotees \u201d declaring , \u201c There is a transcendental philosophy of free trade , with devotees as ardent as any of those who preach the millennium\u2026 Free trade abjured patriotism and boasts of cosmopolitanism . It regards the labor of our own people with no more favor than that of the barbarian on the Danube or the cooly on the Ganges . \u201d\nMcKinley similarly made clear that the original Republican Party was a \u201c workers \u2019 party \u201d :\nThe protective tariff policy of the Republicans\u2026 has made the lives of the masses of our countrymen sweeter and brighter , and has entered the homes of America carrying comfort and cheer and courage . It gives a premium to human energy , and awakens the noblest aspiration in the breasts of men . Our own experience shows that it is the best for our citizenship and our civilization and that it opens up a higher and better destiny for our people .\nInterestingly , it is not only today \u2019 s Republican Party that has wiped McKinley from the nation \u2019 s memory bank , but also President Obama , who went so far as to strip his name from Alaska \u2019 s Mount McKinley \u2014 now dubbed Denali . Donald Trump proclaimed this a \u201c great insult \u201d and pledged that , if elected , he would change the name back .\nLastly , Levin goes so far as to accuse Trump of sounding Marxist because of his desire to make the Republican Party a \u201c workers \u2019 party \u201d :\nNow he [ Trump ] says the Republican is going to be a new party \u2014 the \u201c workers \u2019 party. \u201d The \u201c workers \u2019 party \u201d ? You \u2019 re going to call it the \u201c workers \u2019 party \u201d ? Like the Communist social workers \u2019 union ? [ \u2026 ] You \u2019 re going to sound like Marx now ? [ \u2026 ] We \u2019 re going to start talking about the proletariat ? And the bourgeois next ? That \u2019 s Bernie Sanders stuff !\nWhile Levin presents himself as a guardian of our founders \u2019 economic principles , his support for unilateral free trade ironically places his trading views closer to Karl Marx than it does to the legacy of Washington , Hamilton , and Lincoln .\nIn his 1848 address to the Democratic Association of Brussels , Marx declared that he was \u201c in favor of free trade \u201d because of its destructive capabilities for hastening social revolution :",

As Jefferson wrote in explaining why his views had evolved to favor more protectionist policies: \u201cIn so complicated a science as political economy, no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances, and for their contraries.\u201d\n\nIn 1875, Joseph Wharton \u2014 the steel industrialist who founded the nation\u2019s first business school and Trump\u2019s alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 was more blunt in expressing his disdain for such religious free traders:\n\n[They] assum[e] for their dogmas an infallibility as absolute as that claimed by the Pope for his dicta\u2026 and preaching everywhere the superior claims of their strange creed over the mere bonds of patriotism so that the revenues, development, and the existence of States are to perish in order that their fungus, Trade Philanthropy, may fatten for a while upon the decay, these verbose prophets of the new philosophy have become a nuisance and a source of infection which healthy political organisms can hardly afford to tolerate.\n\nPrestowitz explains:\n\nBeginning with Alexander Hamilton\u2019s proposals for the industrial and technological development of the United States through use of subsidies, tariffs and patents, U.S. leaders pursued the \u201cAmerican System\u201d of government-business partnership for national development of things like the Erie Canal, the telegraph, the transcontinental railroad, the aircraft industry, the RCA company founded by the U.S. Navy, and much more\u2026 [The American System] consisted of government policies and programs aimed at developing advanced infrastructure and protecting and subsidizing development of intellectual property and manufacturing industries.\n\n\u201cThis, of course, was antithetical to the free-market, laissez-faire policies,\u201d which Great Britain \u2014 and eventually the U.S. \u2014 would come to adopt.\n\nIndeed, Henry Clay, the foremost proponent of the American System, made clear that ideological \u201cfree trade\u201d was the American System\u2019s antithesis:\n\nWhen gentlemen have succeeded in their design of an immediate or gradual destruction of the American System, what is their substitute? Free trade! Free trade! The call for free trade is as unavailing as the cry of a spoiled child, in its nurse\u2019s arms, for the moon, or the stars that glitter in the firmament of heaven. It never has existed; it never will exist. Trade implies, at least two parties. To be free, it should be fair, equal and reciprocal.\n\nMany of the founders demonstrated commitment to promoting American manufacturing.\n\nAt his inauguration, George Washington is said to have spurned the fashion of his day \u2014 opting not to wear an elegant suit from Europe but instead a woolen suit made of cloth woven at the Hartford Woolen Manufactory in Connecticut. \u201cI hope it will not be a great while, before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress,\u201d Washington wrote in 1789.\n\n\u201cI use no porter or cheese in my family, but such as is made in America,\u201d Washington wrote, boasting that these domestic products are \u201cof an excellent quality.\u201d\n\nOne of the first acts of Congress Washington signed was a tariff among whose stated purpose was \u201cthe encouragement and protection of manufactures.\u201d\n\nPrestowitz further explains that in his 1791 Report on Manufactures, Alexander Hamilton, our nation\u2019s first Secretary of Treasury, laid out a proposal that followed the \u201cEnglish mercantilist model closely\u201d by calling for high tariffs to protect nascent American industry, supporting agriculture to encourage more exports, promoting \u201cBuy American\u201d policies and allocating federal funds for transit systems to facilitate commerce such as roads, bridges, and harbors.\n\nFletcher notes that \u201cHamilton\u2019s policies were not adopted in toto right away.\u201d It took the War of 1812 and witnessing Great Britain\u2019s abusive trading practices \u201cto push America firmly into the protectionist camp.\u201d\n\nWhile some founders were less protectionist than Hamilton, they were far more protectionist than today\u2019s free traders. Indeed, the extent to which there was disagreement amongst the founders did not come close the chasm that exists today between the Paul Ryan, Wall Street Journal, Mark Levin \u201cfree traders\u201d versus Pat Buchanan \u201cprotectionists.\u201d Rather, their disagreements represented comparatively minor shades of variation between two schools of thought \u2014 both of which would today be regarded as protectionist.\n\nGiven the objections to Britain\u2019s trading practices and the belief that trade needs to be \u201cequal and reciprocal,\u201d it seems unlikely the founders would support what former Nucor Steel chairman has described as the \u201cunilateral trade disarmament\u201d of our policies today.\n\nHenry Clay explained that \u201cequal and reciprocal\u201d free trade \u201cnever has existed; [and] it never will exist.\u201d He warned against practicing \u201cromantic trade philanthropy\u2026 which invokes us to continue to purchase the produce of foreign industry, without regard to the state or prosperity of our own.\u201d Clay made clear that he was \u201cutterly and irreconcilably opposed\u201d to trade which would \u201cthrow wide open our ports to foreign productions\u201d without reciprocation.\n\nIn 1822, President Monroe observed that \u201cwhatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce,\u201d the conditions necessary for its success \u2014 reciprocity and international peace \u2014 \u201chas never occurred and can not be expected.\u201d Monroe said, \u201cstrong reasons\u2026 impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures.\u201d\n\nLikewise, in 1819 John Adams noted that he did not live in a world in which \u201call the nations of the earth\u201d had adopted \u201cthe abolition of all restrictive, exclusive, and monopolizing laws.\u201d Adams concluded that while foreign nations \u201cpreserve in cherishing such laws\u2026 I know not how we can do ourselves justice without introducing\u2026 some portions of the same system.\u201d\n\nIn an 1816 letter, Jefferson, an agrarian who had originally been more supportive of \u201cfree trade,\u201d expressed vexation that free traders attempted to use his earlier writings to promote their ideological agenda.\n\nYou tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures. There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor, but within the thirty years which have since elapsed, how are circumstances changed! [\u2026] [He] who is now against domestic manufacture must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins, and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns. I am not one of these. Experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort.\n\nJefferson blasted the free traders who use his former opinion on trade \u201conly as a stalking horse, to cover their disloyal propensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly people.\u201d\n\nYet today religious free traders continue to use the founders\u2019 legacy to promote their agenda. Indeed, compare the words of our founders and early Republican presidents to those of today\u2019s conservative commentariat. This tension is perhaps best exemplified by Mark Levin, who has branded himself a constitutional scholar and \u201cconstitutional conservative.\u201d\n\nIn a recent segment, Levin bizarrely suggests that the bureaucracy necessary for implementing Trump\u2019s \u201cprotectionism\u201d would go far beyond the scope of limited government envisioned by our founders:\n\nNotice there\u2019s never any discussion about the massive bureaucracy that\u2019s going to be necessary if we have massive tariffs and protectionism \u2014 the power of the central government outside the constitution controlling\u2026 the movement of goods and services.\n\nHowever, Lincoln would seem to disagree and argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation:\n\nThe tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass and other green thing.\n\nCuriously, anti-tariff purists seem to favor a taxation model that is the exact inversion of the founder\u2019s model \u2014 i.e. where income, consumption or sales are directly taxed, but imports are not. Yet this policy, however, would likely only have the effect of incentivizing people involved in production to shift that production overseas. Levin similarly suggests that unrestricted free trade is a necessity:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I want you to look around your homes, I want you to look at your automobile in many cases. We kind of need trade, don\u2019t we? Otherwise why are you buying all of these things?\n\nHowever, in 1775, John Adams posed Levin\u2019s same question and arrived at the exact opposite conclusion of the \u201cLiberty\u2019s Voice\u201d host.\n\n\u201cCan The Inhabitants of North America live without foreign Trade?\u201d Adams asked.\n\nAnswering his own question, Adams concluded: \u201cWe must at first indeed sacrifice some of our appetites coffee, wine, punch, sugar, molasses\u2026 and our dress would not be so elegant\u2026 But these are trifles in a contest for Liberty.\u201d\n\nLevin has said he opposes Trump\u2019s protectionism because it will create higher prices for consumers:\n\nA tariff is really just a tax\u2026 imposed on the American people\u2026 While Trump and his surrogates may have the money to pay the higher prices his policies would cause, many Americans \u2013 who are already having difficulty making ends meet \u2013 do not.\n\nHowever, in a declaration that would seem to apply to our relationship with China today, Adams warned against the allure of cheap foreign goods that result from illicit trading practices:\n\n[British manufactures] disgorged upon us all their stores of merchandise and manufactures, not only without profit, but at certain loss for a time\u2026 The cheapness of these articles allures us into extravagance and luxury, involves us in debt, exhausts our resources, and at length produces universal complaint.\n\nRepublican President McKinley rejected the \u201ccheaper is better\u201d argument outright: \u201cThey [free traders] say, \u2018Buy where you can buy the cheapest.\u2019 That is one of their maxims\u2026 Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: \u2018Buy where you can pay the easiest.\u2019 And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.\u201d\n\nThey say, if you had not the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper. Well, whether a thing is cheap or whether it is dear depends on what we can earn by our daily labor. Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer. Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer.\n\nAdditionally, Hamilton and Lincoln argued that based on economies of scale, any temporary increase in costs resulting from a tariff would eventually decrease as the domestic manufacturer produced more.\n\nHamilton explained that despite an initial \u201cincrease of price\u201d caused by regulations that control foreign competition, once a \u201cdomestic manufacture has attained to perfection\u2026 it invariably becomes cheaper.\u201d\n\nLincoln similarly said that, \u201cif a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article\u201d that could be produced domestically, \u201cat no distant day, in consequence of such duty,\u201d the domestic article \u201cwill be sold to our people cheaper than before.\u201d\n\nUnlike Levin, Lincoln did not see a tariff as a tax on low-income Americans because it would only burden the consumer according to the amount the consumer consumed.\n\nBy the tariff system, the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods\u2026 the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free.\n\nLevin argues that adopting protectionist policies to defend America\u2019s industrial independence is not conservative. \u201cWhat I see developing is not a conservative coalition, but a coalition on the Republican side of big government advocates,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThe Republican Party now is a party of the progressive Republicans. Theodore Roosevelt\u2026 the protectionists, Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, the No-Growthers.\u201d\n\nHowever, contrary to Levin\u2019s suggestion, from 1871 to 1913 under the leadership of mostly Republican presidents, \u201cthe average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4.3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century,\u201d notes Alfred Eckes Jr., chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan.\n\nMoreover, contrary to Levin\u2019s telling of history, defending the American worker through trade protectionism was a priority of the original Republican Party. Free trade was the policy of Democrats. As Ian Fletcher has observed, \u201creading the speech of 19th-century Republican politicians today, with their expressions of concern for the wages of the American working man, one finds oneself wondering how the party slipped to its present day let-them-eat-cake position.\u201d The Party of Lincoln had always been the Party of Protectionism. Indeed, Fletcher notes that Lincoln\u2019s number two issue after slavery was the tariff.\n\nIn 1896, the GOP platform pledged to \u201crenew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the GOP\u2019s original view on trade seemed guided by the same \u201cAmerica First\u201d principle articulated by Donald Trump.\n\nAs Whig representative and later Republican senator, Justin Morrill explained during an 1857 tariff debate: \u201cI am ruling America for the benefit, first, of Americans, and for the \u2018rest of mankind\u2019 afterwards.\u201d\n\nMorrill attacked free trade \u201cdevotees\u201d declaring, \u201cThere is a transcendental philosophy of free trade, with devotees as ardent as any of those who preach the millennium\u2026 Free trade abjured patriotism and boasts of cosmopolitanism. It regards the labor of our own people with no more favor than that of the barbarian on the Danube or the cooly on the Ganges.\u201d\n\nMcKinley similarly made clear that the original Republican Party was a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d:\n\nThe protective tariff policy of the Republicans\u2026 has made the lives of the masses of our countrymen sweeter and brighter, and has entered the homes of America carrying comfort and cheer and courage. It gives a premium to human energy, and awakens the noblest aspiration in the breasts of men. Our own experience shows that it is the best for our citizenship and our civilization and that it opens up a higher and better destiny for our people.\n\nInterestingly, it is not only today\u2019s Republican Party that has wiped McKinley from the nation\u2019s memory bank, but also President Obama, who went so far as to strip his name from Alaska\u2019s Mount McKinley \u2014 now dubbed Denali. Donald Trump proclaimed this a \u201cgreat insult\u201d and pledged that, if elected, he would change the name back.\n\nLastly, Levin goes so far as to accuse Trump of sounding Marxist because of his desire to make the Republican Party a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d:\n\nNow he [Trump] says the Republican is going to be a new party \u2014 the \u201cworkers\u2019 party.\u201d The \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d? You\u2019re going to call it the \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d? Like the Communist social workers\u2019 union? [\u2026] You\u2019re going to sound like Marx now? [\u2026] We\u2019re going to start talking about the proletariat? And the bourgeois next? That\u2019s Bernie Sanders stuff!\n\nWhile Levin presents himself as a guardian of our founders\u2019 economic principles, his support for unilateral free trade ironically places his trading views closer to Karl Marx than it does to the legacy of Washington, Hamilton, and Lincoln.\n\nIn his 1848 address to the Democratic Association of Brussels, Marx declared that he was \u201cin favor of free trade\u201d because of its destructive capabilities for hastening social revolution:",
