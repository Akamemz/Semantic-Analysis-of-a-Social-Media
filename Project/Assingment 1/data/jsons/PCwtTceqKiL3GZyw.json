'' I figured most of the country , or the world , would be sick of reading about the recession and bankers and bailouts . As a person with a job , it would be easy for me to say that 's a 2008 story . Time to move on .\nBut that 's why I trust the wisdom of the crowd : You tell me when I 'm wrong . America 's widening gap between the rich and poor -- and this country 's fast-disappearing sense of security and progress and economic stability -- is so far the top pick among the 20 subjects I presented as part of a new project called Change the List\nThat tells me that for many of you , it is the most pressing justice issue of our time . I would n't have seen that on my own , and I 'm glad you did . You encouraged me to look deeper into the issue , and I 'm excited that we might be delving into this story together .\nThe vote is part of a new CNN Opinion project that focuses on bringing attention to overlooked places and issues . I 'm asking you to pick stories you find most compelling or important from a list of 20 -- and I 'll report on the five winners . Voting closes at 2:00 p.m . ET on Monday , so there is still plenty of time for you to influence the outcome .\nHere are the top five issues as of noon on Wednesday :\nAbout 23,000 ballots have been submitted so far , and only 916 votes separate the topics in fourth and seventh places , as of this writing . That 's close . ( While this story was being completed , `` illegal animal trade '' jumped into fifth place , for instance ) .\nWhen I noticed rich-poor gap was such a crowd favorite , I was a little disappointed , to be honest . How could I stop an economy story from being dull and gray ? But last night I started doing some research and started to see what many of you had already noticed : that this is a broadly important and interesting topic -- an underreported story , despite the never-ending flood of financial news headlines . ( Friends at sites like CNNMoney and NPR 's Planet Money have been doing a stellar job of covering the crisis ; but does anyone want to read another jobs-report story ? And just forget about the Dow . )\nBeneath all the spreadsheets and wonkery , this seems to be a story about fairness and people . Is it one about rich folks who caused the recession and got off clean ? About poor folks bearing the brunt of the recession ? About a return to free market ideals ? They 're fascinating issues , and I 'm undecided on them at this point .\nCNN should continue to cover the war in Syria , whether or not you would vote for that . Same goes for this NSA madness . But with Change the List , I 'm trusting you to choose . You deserve to have a say in what I cover -- and in what CNN covers . Not because this is a popularity contest , but because I firmly believe that stories are more meaningful for people when they 're part of them . No one wants be on the wrong end of a bullhorn .\nI 'm excited to explore these topics -- any of these topics -- together .\nSo please vote . Think about which stories are most important , which could have the most impact and which you 're willing to be a part of . Encourage others to do the same .
