    "content": "The Obama administration has never fined or prosecuted a wind farm for killing eagles and other protected bird species , shielding the industry from liability and helping keep the scope of the deaths secret , an Associated Press investigation has found .\nMore than 573,000 birds are killed by the country 's wind farms each year , including 83,000 hunting birds such as hawks , falcons and eagles , according to an estimate published in March in the peer-reviewed Wildlife Society Bulletin .\nEach death is federal crime , a charge that the Obama administration has used to prosecute oil companies when birds drown in their waste pits , and power companies when birds are electrocuted by their power lines . No wind energy company has been prosecuted , even those that repeatedly flout the law .\nWind power , a pollution-free energy intended to ease global warming , is a cornerstone of President Barack Obama 's energy plan . His administration has championed a $ 1 billion-a-year tax break to the industry that has nearly doubled the amount of wind power in his first term .\nThe large death toll at wind farms shows how the renewable energy rush comes with its own environmental consequences , trade-offs the Obama administration is willing to make in the name of cleaner energy .\n`` It is the rationale that we have to get off of carbon , we have to get off of fossil fuels , that allows them to justify this , '' said Tom Dougherty , a long-time environmentalist who worked for nearly 20 years for the National Wildlife Federation in the West , until his retirement in 2008 . `` But at what cost ? In this case , the cost is too high .

Getting precise figures is impossible because many companies are n't required to disclose how many birds they kill .
