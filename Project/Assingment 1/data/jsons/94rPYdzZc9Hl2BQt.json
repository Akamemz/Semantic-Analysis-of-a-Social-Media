Bush appointee who sits in Lincoln, Neb., urged his fellow judges to evade the shutdown by designating all their staff as essential and exempt from furlough.\n\n\u201cGiven the loss of employees already suffered by the judiciary on account of the sequester and otherwise, why shouldn\u2019t every remaining employee of every federal district court (including [federal public defenders]) be declared \u2018essential?\u2019\u201d the judge asked.\n\n\u201cSuch an order would set up an inter-branch dispute worth having\u2026.[Congress] could do nothing, in which event Congress loses its ability to destroy the judiciary [by] failing to pass a budget. Or, Congress could go batshit and the judiciary and Congress could have it out,\u201d he said.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)\n\nSuch exasperation is even creeping into judicial rulings.\n\nWhen lawyers for the House urged Judge Amy Berman Jackson to keep a case demanding Operation Fast and Furious-related records from Attorney General Eric Holder moving forward during the shutdown, the judge said lawmakers could cool their heels, just like others with claims pending against the government.\n\n\u201cWhile the vast majority of litigants who now must endure a delay in the progress of their matters do so due to circumstances beyond their control, that cannot be said of the House of Representatives, which has played a role in the shutdown that prompted the stay motion,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nEven before the shutdown, the judiciary shed nearly 2,700 support staff positions over the past two years. Funding for drug testing and electronic monitoring of pre-trial detainees had also been slashed by 20 percent, and federal defenders were under orders to take about 15 days of unpaid furlough in the past year.\n\n( PHOTOS: 18 times the government has shut down)\n\nThe cuts have caused delays in criminal and civil cases. Even the posting of judges\u2019 orders has slowed, with many federal court clerk\u2019s offices looking largely empty compared with a few years ago.\n\nSequestration cut $350 million, or about 5 percent, from the judiciary\u2019s budget in the past fiscal year, bringing it to about $6.6 billion annually.\n\nJudges themselves are effectively exempt from furlough because the Constitution says their salaries \u2014 currently $174,000 for district court judges \u2014 cannot be reduced.\n\nFor the past two weeks, the federal courts have essentially operated on fumes, using funds from filing fees and so-called no-year appropriations to pay salaries and keep the lights on.
