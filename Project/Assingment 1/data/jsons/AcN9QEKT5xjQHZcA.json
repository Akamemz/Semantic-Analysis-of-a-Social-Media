With more attacks on police over the weekend in Missouri , Tennessee , Georgia and Texas and additional protests against police shootings across the country , many Americans are deeply concerned that the country is coming apart . This sentiment will not go away easily .\nHow Did They Do ? Both candidates did well , especially Donald Trump , whose statement was posted on Facebook and picked up by the networks and cables .

They are searching for their next president , a person who will help heal the country .\nThese issues will remain part of America \u2019 s public dialogue , and both candidates have strengths in dealing with them . Trump is viewed as a strong leader and comes across as a true supporter of law enforcement . Clinton has adopted a more unifying tone in her campaign and , driven by a desire to maximize black turnout , strives to be more emphatic with the African-American community .\nIronically , the candidate who deals with these issues in a more apolitical way \u2013 projecting strength and unity , finding a positive voice to call the country together , defending the vital role of the police and the rule of law while demonstrating a concern with justice for those wrongly killed \u2013 is the candidate who will most likely benefit . People are not looking for a politician or office-seeker in these terrible events . They are searching for their next president , a person who will help heal the country .\nGuilty , but unindicted : Last week started with FBI Director James Comey finding Clinton guilty of setting up an unauthorized private email server , being \u201c extremely reckless \u201d in handling classified material and making false statements to the American people about why she did it , whether she sent or received classified material and if she handed over all her official emails . Then he refused to indict . This issue is not going away .\nHow did they handle the email controversy ? Clinton and her surrogates said the fact that she escaped indictment meant this issue is now old news .

And the \u201c chance \u201d meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the report in the New York Times that Clinton might keep Lynch as A.G. added to the perception that there \u2019 s one set of rules for the Clintons and one for everyone else .\nSurprisingly , in his first rally after Comey \u2019 s announcement , Trump spent most of his Cincinnati speech on Wednesday defending his campaign \u2019 s use of a Star of David in a weekend tweet . Trump \u2019 s failure to dwell on Clinton \u2019 s email scandal meant the headlines were all about the Star of David , not the case against Hillary . He \u2019 s got plenty of time to return to the issue , but Trump missed a big opportunity . Simply screaming \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d at rallies won \u2019 t make this controversy the important part of the decisions of swing voters it should be .\nLeftward , Ho ! Hillary continued her long march to the democratic socialist fringe of the Democratic Party last week , seeking to appease Bernie Sanders \u2019 followers by endorsing free college for anyone whose family income is less than $ 125,000 ( as long as the kid goes to a public university ) . She then came out for the \u201c government option \u201d in health care , meaning a single-payer socialist system like in most of Europe , allowing people 55 or older to enroll in Medicare ( whose hospital trust fund is already going bankrupt in 2030 ) and other platform planks backed by the Sandernistas .\nHer allies and President Obama \u2019 s people rebuffed the Berniacs when they proposed a plank that explicitly opposed a vote on Obama \u2019 s Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership in the lame duck congressional session after the election .\nComing Attractions : Sanders will endorse Clinton this week , but will that mean the end to further challenges to the Democratic Party \u2019 s rules or any additional platform fights ?
