    "content": "School Shooter Armed With 'Hundreds ' Of Rounds Of Ammunition , Police Say\nPolice on Sunday said 20-year-old Adam Lanza was armed with a high-powered rifle , two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition when he forcibly entered a Newtown , Conn. , elementary school and proceeded to gun down 20 young students and six faculty members .\nThe latest information on the tragedy , the worst violence at an elementary school in U.S. history , came ahead of President Obama 's arrival in the town where Friday 's mass shooting took place . The president met with families of the victims and planned to attend an evening vigil , where he will speak .\nConnecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance , speaking at an afternoon news conference , said `` the weapon that was utilized most of the time during the crime was a [ .223 caliber ] Bushmaster rifle . ''\nLanza also carried a 9mm Sig Sauer and a 10mm Glock , both handguns , he said , adding that one of the handguns had been used by the assailant to take his own life .\nVance said the death of the shooter 's mother , Nancy Lanza , had officially been ruled a homicide . She was shot and killed by her son at her suburban home before his rampage at the Sandy Hook Elementary School . Earlier Sunday , Connecticut Medical Examiner Wayne Carver said that Ms. Lanza had been shot multiple times in the head .\nVance said `` all weapons had multiple magazines and ammunition , '' adding that each of the magazines had a capacity of approximately 30 rounds . Asked by reporters how many rounds there were in total , he replied : `` hundreds . ''\nVance said a fourth weapon , a shotgun , had been recovered in the vehicle Lanza drove to the school on the day of the attack . Earlier , officials had suggested that weapon was recovered from the home the assailant shared with his mother .\nThe police lieutenant reiterated remarks he had made an earlier media briefing , saying that authorities were `` pleased with the work that has been done so far , '' but that determining a motive for the crime would take `` many , many man hours . ''\nWithout elaborating , he also repeated an earlier warning to anyone who `` harasses , threatens or intimidates the investigation ... either in person , also on the Internet , via social media or telephone . '' Any person doing so would be fully prosecuted , he said .\nAt an earlier news conference on Sunday , Vance said forensic analysis and interviews of witnesses would take considerable time .\n`` I am confident that we will put every single resource into this investigation ... and our goal is to answer every single question , '' he told reporters .\nVance said authorities had spoken to `` many , many witnesses , but there are many more . '' He added that the interviews might extend to children who survived the attack , noting there was an `` immense number of witnesses . ''\n`` There is weeks worth of work that needs to be done to complete this [ investigation ] , '' he said .\nVance also warned members of the media and public that `` misinformation '' was being disseminated via social media sites . Information on such unofficial sources , he said , `` can not be confirmed and in many cases [ is ] inaccurate . '' Vance elaborated that `` threatening and inaccurate '' information was coming from `` people posing as other people '' on social media .\nVance confirmed that the school had been `` forcibly entered . '' He also said four weapons had been linked to the killings in Newtown . Earlier , authorities said three firearms were found at the school : a Sig Sauer handgun , a Glock handgun and a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle .\nA law enforcement source tells NPR 's Carrie Johnson that the fourth weapon was found at the Newtown home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother , and that it was used to kill her . The source tells NPR that all four weapons had been purchased legally by Nancy Lanza .\nSeparately , Ginger Colbrun , a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms , tells NPR that ATF agents have fanned out across the greater Newtown area to visit gun stores and shooting ranges to possibly learn more about the gunman 's activities in the weeks , months and even years before the attack .\nAdam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning and gunned down 20 children and six adults , including the school 's principal , before killing himself .\nUpdate at 10:35 a.m . ET : Connecticut governor offers details about Lanza 's death :\nConnecticut Gov . Dan Malloy tells ABC 's This Week that authorities believe Lanza shot himself as first responders closed in .\n`` We surmise that ... he heard responders coming and apparently at that , decided to take his own life , '' Malloy said .\nIn a subsequent appearance on CNN , Malloy described the gunman as `` troubled '' but would not elaborate on his mental state . He reiterated that the shooter had `` used a gun on himself . ''\nAn emotional Malloy said he is the one who had to tell the families that `` their loved ones would not be returning to them . ''\nIn Newtown , NPR 's Susannah George says , `` there is a constant stream of people coming and going from the makeshift memorial at the entrance to Sandy Hook Elementary School . Many people have come from out of town \u2014 some as far as an hour away \u2014 to lay flowers and light candles . ''\nAlso on Sunday , Newtown 's St. Rose of Lima Church was evacuated for about an hour during services after a phoned-in bomb threat , says Brian Wallace , director of communications for the Diocese of Bridgeport . Police and a SWAT team arrived on the scene with guns drawn , but authorities later said there was no danger . The Associated Press reported that the church would remain on lockdown for the rest of the day as a precaution .\nAsked about the incident at the afternoon news conference , Vance confirmed that the church and the rectory had been thoroughly searched and that an investigation into the incident was underway .\nTwelve girls and eight boys were killed . Sixteen of them were just 6 years old and four were only 7 . School officials say Principal Dawn Hochsprung , 47 , and school psychologist Mary Sherlach , 56 , were shot and killed as they tried to stop Lanza . Teacher Anne Marie Murphy , 52 , was killed as she shielded her students , authorities say . Teachers Victoria Soto , 27 , Rachel Davino , 29 , and substitute teacher Lauren Garbrielle Rousseau , 30 , were also among the dead .

The paper writes :\nThere was a common refrain among acquaintances of Adam Lanza : I knew of him but I did n't know him . Lanza kept to himself .
