When a Republican presidential candidate \u2019 s name chalked on a sidewalk is cause for student protest , \u201c bias response team \u201d investigations , or even calls to the police , universities are clearly not embracing robust dialogue . When faculty are disciplined for critiquing university-sponsored anti-bias training , it \u2019 s evident that only certain views are deemed permissible . So Pew \u2019 s new study showing that conservative support for higher education has plummeted was noteworthy but hardly surprising . Pew reported that nearly two-thirds ( 65 percent ) of conservative Republicans say colleges and universities have a negative effect on the country , while 43 percent of moderate and liberal Republicans agree .\nThese results have prompted predictable head-shaking and defensiveness on the part of college and university officials . The most revealing response was offered up in the Chronicle of Higher Education by the respected Terry Hartle , senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education . After noting just how problematic it is for higher education and for the nation that colleges and universities are seen as partisan institutions , Hartle explained why it is that higher education has lost favor on the Right .\nHint : It \u2019 s not because conservative speakers have been disinvited , shouted down , and assaulted by campus mobs . Nor is it because of institutions \u2019 repressive speech codes , seemingly adopted to stymie any opinions that run afoul of regnant notions of political correctness .
