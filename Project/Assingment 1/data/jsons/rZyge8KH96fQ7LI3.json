This year , three key federal agencies issued stark warnings about suicide and overdose risk associated with these practices .\nBut patients , doctors , and advocates report that dose cutbacks are continuing\u2014and a new survey shows that physicians remain hesitant to help these patients . Without changes in law enforcement policy , both patients and physicians will continue to be harmed .\nIn April , the Food and Drug Administration released a warning admitting that rapid opioid cessation had led to and can cause \u201c uncontrolled pain , psychological distress , and suicide , \u201d telling doctors to stop doing it .\nThat same month , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines with a similar message : Not all pain patients should have their opioids reduced or eliminated ; some will continue to function best on medication , even at high doses . In October , the Department of Health and Human Services added to the chorus with a tapering guide that urges physicians to avoid rapid tapers and to consider the needs of individual patients .\nUnfortunately , patients themselves report that little has changed . Rapid tapers and apparently-related deaths are still occurring , desperate victims crying out for help on social media [ warning : graphic image ] . Physicians are either refusing these patients or insisting they take lower doses .\nA survey of 500 primary care physicians by Quest Diagnostics conducted this summer\u2014after the FDA and CDC announcements\u2014and released in October found that 81 percent are reluctant to care for chronic pain patients who take opioids and 83 percent say that the pressure to reduce prescribing has made pain treatment \u201c considerably harder . \u201d\nKate Nicholson , a pain patient , civil rights attorney , and advocate based in Denver , Colorado , said she receives around five to seven unsolicited emails a day from people who are affected by the push to cut opioid prescriptions . Some have lost family members to suicide ; some are watching their loved ones suffer increased pain and disability from a forced , rapid taper . Others are concerned doctors or pain patients themselves , seeking help .\nNicholson said of the Quest survey , \u201c You can see if you drill down into these numbers that physicians are struggling to treat pain . Eighty-three percent say it 's considerably harder . They do n't know what to do with people. \u201d She added that she has n't seen much evidence that the efforts from the FDA , CDC , and HHS have led to real differences for patients .\nPatrice Harris , a psychiatrist who serves as president of the American Medical Association and chair of its opioid task force said , \u201c We are still hearing some of these concerns as well , \u201d noting that her organization is continuing to fight against rigid dose limits and other policies set by insurers , pharmacies , and states that do n't allow doctors to individualize care and therefore harm patients .\n\u201c Being a pain doctor myself , I think it 's a travesty , \u201d said Jeff Gudin , a senior medical advisor for Quest Diagnostics who worked on the survey and clinical associate professor of anesthesiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School . \u201c It \u2019 s a bad time to be a pain patient in our history of medicine , \u201d he said , explaining that the backlash against opioids has ignored the fact that \u201c science hasn \u2019 t given us any other medicines that are truly effective for severe levels of pain . \u201d\nThe Quest survey also found that 72 percent of doctors \u201c worry that chronic pain patients will turn to illicit drugs \u201d and that while the crackdown might reduce prescription opioid deaths , \u201c the trade-off is a greater number of patients whose pain is not properly managed . \u201d\nWhile Gudin agreed that excessive and inappropriate prescribing\u2014such as giving a month \u2019 s supply of strong opioids after wisdom teeth surgery\u2014did need to be reined in , he said the pendulum has now swung too far in the opposite direction .

Just last week , she had to fight for pain care for her mother who has dementia and was in intensive care .

Cries of distress are ubiquitous in her Twitter feed and direct messages .\n\u201c What I \u2019 m hearing is that people are still being tapered , \u201d Peacock said , \u201c And what I 'm hearing is that doctor 's offices , hospitals , and insurers are setting these things as policy . \u201d\nIndeed , many large medical organizations , insurers , and state legislatures are still acting as though the now-outdated CDC guidelines are mandates to be applied to all patients . For example , Kaiser Permanente in Spokane , Washington , in October sent patients a notice that they wanted to reduce all opioid doses to below 50 morphine equivalents ( MME , a standard measure that allows comparison of different medications ) . The 2016 CDC guideline suggested not going over 90 MME , but its April clarification emphasizes this does n't mean that all patients need to be tapered .\nAnd some insurers are now actually paying doctors not to prescribe opioids : Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan increases the amount it will pay for specific surgeries by 35 percent if surgeons only prescribe a minimal amount of opioids afterwards . This could yield thousands of dollars per procedure for the doctors performing them . For example , with a complex gastric sleeve surgery for obesity , which can pay as much as $ 49,900 to the doctor , the additional payment would be as high as $ 17,465 . This obviously provides an enormous incentive for doctors to skimp on medication , regardless of the amount of pain their patient reports .\nUnderlying all these efforts and driving their continuation is a fundamental legal problem .
