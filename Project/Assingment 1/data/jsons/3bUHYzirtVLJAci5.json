And the FBI unlawfully withheld the names of two agents who questioned Carmody .\nReporters Committee attorneys made the case that the authorities \u2019 inadequate searches violate the Freedom of Information Act in a recent motion in which the organization asked a federal court in Washington , D.C. , to reject the government \u2019 s request to quickly resolve a FOIA lawsuit in its favor . In the filing , they urged the district court to order the bureau to produce all responsive records related to the Carmody case .\nThe July 2 court filing marks the latest development in the Reporters Committee \u2019 s year-long fight to better understand the federal government \u2019 s involvement in the raid . Although San Francisco police obtained warrants to search Carmody \u2019 s property in May 2019 , the raid stunned American journalists and press freedom advocates . City police officers , accompanied by FBI agents , searched Carmody \u2019 s home and office , seized his equipment , and detained and questioned him for six hours as part of an investigation to learn the identity of a confidential source who leaked an internal police report to Carmody . A court later quashed all of the search warrants that gave rise to the searches , as each violated California \u2019 s shield law , and Carmody reached a $ 369,000 settlement with the City of San Francisco in March .\nMeanwhile , the Reporters Committee has learned previously undisclosed details about the raid through public records from the San Francisco Police Department and federal agencies . For example , an FBI document obtained by the Reporters Committee last year through a FOIA lawsuit revealed that FBI agents knew Carmody was a journalist when they questioned him . More recently , a San Francisco Police Department memo obtained by the Reporters Committee showed that officers who conducted the raid on Carmody \u2019 s home were instructed not to use their body-worn cameras .\nBut the FBI \u2019 s latest admission \u2014 that the bureau did not follow internal Justice Department rules meant to protect journalists from unlawful searches and seizures \u2014 is especially alarming .\n\u201c The government \u2019 s failure to abide by its own policy in connection with the FBI \u2019 s questioning of Carmody is deeply troubling , \u201d Reporters Committee attorneys state in their cross motion for summary judgment . \u201c Plaintiff and the public have a right to be fully informed as to how and why the federal government \u2019 s own rules for questioning journalists were not followed here . \u201d\nThe Justice Department codified its internal News Media Policy in 1973 , as public outrage grew in response to a tidal wave of federal subpoenas that asked journalists to turn over their confidential materials . The policy , which was most recently updated in 2014 and 2015 , prohibits federal officials from questioning reporters or seizing their work materials without following a certain set of procedures \u2014 including getting approval from the U.S. Attorney General , except in extreme circumstances .\nBut government filings in the Reporters Committee \u2019 s FOIA lawsuit demonstrate that federal law enforcement officials did not follow the guidelines before questioning Carmody . A declaration submitted to the court by a senior Justice Department FOIA official stated that all consultation and authorization requests made pursuant to the news media guidelines are tracked in a Justice Department database .
