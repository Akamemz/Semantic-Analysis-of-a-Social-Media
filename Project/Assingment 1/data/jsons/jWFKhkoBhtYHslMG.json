    "content": "As Americans continue to give the news media a solid grade overall for coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic , the percentage who say journalists have exaggerated the risks of the outbreak has decreased notably in recent weeks , according to survey data from \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Election News Pathway project .\nAmong U.S. adults surveyed from April 20-26 , 69 % say the news media have covered the outbreak very well or somewhat well , a number that is virtually unchanged from the 70 % of respondents who said the same thing in a survey conducted from March 10-16 .\nBut as the toll from the coronavirus has grown dramatically over time , there has been movement in the share of Americans who say the news media have greatly or slightly exaggerated the risks it poses \u2013 with that percentage dropping from 62 % in March to 48 % in April . That includes a decline in the portion saying the media have greatly exaggerated the risks , from 37 % to 24 % . At the same time , the portion of respondents who say the media have gotten the COVID-19 risks about right grew by 9 percentage points \u2013 from 30 % to 39 % .\nWant to see more data on these questions ? To analyze these survey questions by additional media habits and demographic characteristics , visit the interactive tool and access the dataset .\nUnderlying these overall numbers are deep partisan divisions about the media \u2019 s coronavirus coverage \u2013 divisions that were evident in March and remain so in April . Most recently , more than half of Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party ( 54 % ) say the media have covered COVID-19 somewhat or very well in the April survey , a number that swells to about eight-in-ten among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 82 % ) .\nAnd , while about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners ( 68 % ) in the April survey say the media slightly or greatly exaggerated COVID-19 risks , that is true of only three-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners .\nThe portion of those saying the media exaggerated the risks declined across both parties from March to April . But that decrease was considerably more pronounced for Democrats than Republicans \u2013 by a ratio of two-to-one .\nPublic overall says media have done well covering the crisis , but differences by party and ideology are pronounced\nAmericans \u2019 generally positive view of the media \u2019 s coverage of the coronavirus outbreak has remained steady in recent weeks . In March , 70 % of all adults said news organizations have done very well or somewhat well in that task , with nearly the exact same portion , 69 % , saying this now . Within that total , there was also little change from March ( 30 % ) to April ( 27 % ) in the percentage who say the media have done very well .\nWhat also remained consistent across both time periods is the significant partisan divergence on that question . As of late April , 54 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the media have performed somewhat or very well , compared with a full 82 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners \u2013 a gap of 28 percentage points , modestly larger than the 21-point gap in the earlier survey . ( The portion of Republicans saying the media have done very well actually declined 10 points . ) It is worth noting that the strong partisan divide exists alongside a consistent element of President Donald Trump \u2019 s frequent briefings on COVID-19 : direct criticism of news organizations and journalists .\nThat partisan gap is even larger among ideological segments within each party . As of April , about half of conservative Republicans ( 48 % ) say the media have done very or somewhat well in covering COVID-19 . That number grows to 62 % among moderate and liberal Republicans , and it increases further to 81 % among conservative and moderate Democrats and 84 % among liberal Democrats .\nAmericans , particularly Democrats , now less inclined to think the news media have exaggerated the risks of COVID-19\nIn the period covered by the two surveys , the toll taken by the virus and the reaction to it changed dramatically . Public schools and nonessential businesses were shut down while America \u2019 s governors issued stay-at-home orders to residents in most states . On March 10 , there were fewer than 1,500 reported cases in the U.S. By April 26 , the nation was closing in on 1 million cases .\nIn the March survey , about six-in-ten Americans ( 62 % ) said that the media had exaggerated , either slightly or by a great deal , the risks of COVID-19 . An additional 30 % said they had gotten the risks about right , and 8 % said they had not taken the risks seriously enough or not taken them seriously at all . In the April survey , about half ( 48 % ) of adults say the media have exaggerated the risks slightly or greatly , 39 % say they have gotten it about right and 13 % say they have not taken it seriously enough .\nThe partisan chasm on this question grew even larger from March to April . The percentage of both Republicans and Democrats saying the media have exaggerated the risks dropped , with the biggest decrease coming among Democrats .\nBack in March , 76 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the media had exaggerated COVID-19 risks compared with 49 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners , a difference of 27 percentage points .\nAs of April , about two-thirds of Republicans ( 68 % ) say the media have exaggerated the risks . Fewer than half as many Democrats surveyed in April ( 30 % ) say the same , meaning the gap between Republicans and Democrats grew to 38 points .\nAt the same time , the percentage of Democrats who say the media have gotten the risks about right climbed from 41 % in March to 55 % in the April survey . Among Republicans , it moved up modestly from 17 % to 20 % .\nAdding ideology onto political party identification shows particularly wide gaps between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats . Almost three-quarters of conservative Republicans ( 73 % ) respond that the media have exaggerated the COVID-19 risks , compared with 60 % of moderate to liberal Republicans . One-third of moderate and conservative Democrats also say journalists have exaggerated the risks , a number that is even lower , 26 % , among liberal Democrats . Only 16 % of conservative Republicans say the media have gotten the risks about right , compared with 57 % of liberal Democrats .\nAs was the case with parties overall , the shares of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats who say the media have exaggerated the risks decreased since March , but the drop was steeper among liberal Democrats . The percentage of conservative Republicans saying the media exaggerated risks fell from 80 % in the March survey to 73 % in April . But the percentage of liberal Democrats who gave that same response was cut nearly in half \u2013 from 50 % to 26 % .\nThe percentage of conservative Republicans who said the media have gotten the risks about right stayed about equal ( 14 % in March and 16 % in April ) . For liberal Democrats , that figure jumped from 39 % to 57 % .\nThese measures and more can be explored further in the Election News Pathways data tool , where all of the data associated with this project is available for public use .
