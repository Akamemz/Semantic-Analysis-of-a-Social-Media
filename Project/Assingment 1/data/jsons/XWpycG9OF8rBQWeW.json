About the really hard stuff .\nCovering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the past three years , I 've often wondered if people here ever do .\nThis conflict is frequently described as `` intractable , '' with neither side willing to give up their historical perspective or their entrenched positions to end it . And it does not take many interviews to hear repetitions of the same sweeping narrative repeated on each side . Palestinians from different places cite the same historical events to back their views . Israelis who have never met each other use similar turns of phrase .\n`` People have a lot of [ psychological ] resources invested in what they believe about the conflict , '' says Thomas Zeitzoff , a political scientist at American University in Washington , D.C. , who has researched Israeli and Palestinian attitudes .\nHe says the high political stakes and emotional involvement make it hard for Israelis and Palestinians to change their minds .\nBut there have been certain shifts \u2013 in public opinion and in individual beliefs - during the 68 years of Israel 's existence and almost half-century of the Israeli military control over Palestinian territories .\nWhy ? Experts list a range of influences that \u2013 to varying degrees \u2013 can move or even flip deeply held views .\n`` You can point to major events , either in the world or people 's lives , changes in their social context , as well as changes in the kind of messages they get from politicians and other elite sources , '' says Brendan Nyhan , an assistant professor at Dartmouth College who researches politics and misperceptions .\nOther factors include repeated exposure to a new idea , whatever the source , scientific research , and direct personal experience .\nFour people \u2013 two Israeli and two Palestinian \u2013 told me their stories of personal , radical belief change related to the conflict . They not only changed their minds , but , a higher hurdle , their behavior .\nHere are some triggers that led these people to see the world differently than they had before , even in the midst of a larger impasse .\nMany groups supporting co-existence advocate for exposure to the other side . Knowledge develops empathy , they say , which can broaden an individual 's perspective as well as pique curiosity .\nMaayan Poleg is a Middle East program director for the group Seeds of Peace , which brings Palestinian and Israeli teens together for summer camp in Maine . She says the group does not advocate a particular political position and is not directly aiming to change minds .\nBut time together , deliberately discussing the conflict , humanizes the enemy , she says , and helps participants question their assumptions , as well as navigate the onslaught of opinions from politicians , family and media to clarify their individual beliefs .\n`` They become open to accepting the fact that what they know as truth is a narrative . That 's a huge step , '' Poleg said . `` People spend a lot of time defending a specific fact . And it takes them a long time to understand that their fact is actually a narrative . It does n't mean that it 's wrong . It just means that there 's another way to view it . ''\nPalestinians and Israelis used to interact with some regularity , often in the workplace or the marketplace . But over the past 15 years , they have been increasingly separated physically . They now spend very little time together .\nBut one Palestinian who went from throwing stones at Israeli soldiers to teaching non-violence says he began to change his mind about violence while in an Israeli prison . While behind bars , he learned Hebrew , saw his first movie about the Holocaust , and got to know Israeli prison guards .\n`` It 's a process , '' says Bassam Aramin , who became one of the co-founders of Combatants for Peace , a group of former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian ex-militants . `` You never wake up in the morning and say , 'Oh my God , we are wrong . The Israelis are right . I give up fighting . ' ''\nHe remembers the first time he and other ex-combatants \u2013 Israeli and Palestinian - sat down together . He was scared .\n`` We do n't trust them . I think they 're from the Israeli intelligence . Maybe they are coming to arrest us , '' Aramin recalls .\nHe saw fear in the eyes of the Israeli men who sat down with him .\n`` It 's the first time they 're coming to meet a Palestinian terrorist . And they have this fear of maybe one of us will kidnap them and kill them . ''\nTrust did build trust over time and many conversations . They built an organization that teaches empathy and understanding .\nBut empathy is also vulnerable to a change of heart .\nMany Israelis and Palestinians reached out to each other eagerly after leaders signed their first-ever peace plan back in 1993 .\nPeople were hopeful , and more open than ever to the idea they could live together peacefully , says Palestinian sociologist Nader Said .\n`` It was highly euphoric and highly exciting times , '' he remembers .\nBut that peace deal , the Oslo Accords , did not deliver on its promise . Violence returned with a vengeance when the second Palestinian uprising , or intifada , broke out in September 2000 .\nSaid , who has polled Palestinians since the mid-1990s , says by then Palestinian support for co-existence had already begun to fall , as people grew disillusioned by the gap between expectations and reality .\n`` While they felt [ Israeli ] settlement activity would decline , settlement activity has increased , '' he says . `` They felt maybe they 'll have more access to Jerusalem , they have less access now .

She helped present a Tel Aviv exhibition of handcrafts done by women from both sides .\nBut when violence broke out once again , she felt her new Israeli friends did not understand her experiences as Israeli soldiers swept through the West Bank , or her point of view .\n`` All this made me rethink my position and my opinion of Israelis , '' Masrujeh says .\nIsraelis went through the same reversal of hope , says pollster Tamar Hermann .\n`` The repeated failures in achieving something tangible , and then the huge waves of terror , this made people think maybe it 's not workable , '' she says . `` People started to doubt whether the cognitive change which opened the door for the two-state solution was justifiable .
