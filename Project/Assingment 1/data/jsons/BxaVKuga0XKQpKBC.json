    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Top congressional Republicans signaled Thursday that they wouldn \u2019 t be pressured into enacting an immigration framework reached between President Donald Trump and top Democrats , as conservatives reacted with alarm to news of a fledgling deal to protect young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children .\nMr. Trump , who ran for president on a hard-line immigration platform , jolted many of his own supporters by agreeing with Democrats to pair legal status for the group often called \u201c Dreamers \u201d with enhanced border security measures . The president agreed that the package would omit funding for his promised border wall , and said nothing about including other enforcement measures aimed at finding and deporting people living illegally in the U.S .\nIt was the second time in a week that Mr. Trump bypassed his party and dealt directly with Democrats . That left GOP congressional leaders excluded , but also relieved them of some of the political burden of delivering on immigration , which has long divided their party , GOP aides said .\nThe new framework was crafted at a White House dinner Wednesday with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) . No GOP lawmakers were invited .\n\u201c We \u2019 re working on a plan , subject to getting massive border controls , \u201d the president said Thursday at the White House . \u201c The wall will come later. \u201d He said he was \u201c fairly close \u201d to reaching an agreement with the Democrats .\nMr. Trump said House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) were \u201c on board \u201d with his approach . The GOP leaders responded that Congress would craft any legislative package , and said negotiations would take on a broad set of immigration issues , including enforcement measures beyond border security .\n\u201c The president wasn \u2019 t negotiating a deal last night . The president was talking with Democratic leaders to get their perspectives , \u201d Mr. Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) told reporters . \u201c The president understands he \u2019 s going to have to work with the congressional majority to get any kind of legislative solution . \u201d\nMr. McConnell said the fate of the young immigrants should be part of a larger immigration debate , including interior enforcement . \u201c We look forward to receiving the Trump administration \u2019 s legislative proposal as we continue our work on these issues , \u201d he said in a statement .\nThe leaders weren \u2019 t specific , but interior enforcement measures favored by conservatives include mandating that businesses use the E-Verify system to check whether applicants can work legally and punishing \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d that don \u2019 t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement .\nIn the coming weeks , Mr. Ryan and other GOP leaders will need to decide how large a role to play in a policy fight that has long divided their party , according to lawmakers and aides .\nHouse GOP leaders are starting an immigration working group with Republicans from the Homeland Security , Judiciary and Appropriations committees , including a mix of conservative and more centrist Republicans , an aide said .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s decision to work with Democrats leaves him owning the issue , giving congressional leaders some political breathing room to pass legislation , GOP aides said . But Republican leaders are already under pressure from conservatives to push back against the president and drive a tougher bargain than he did .\nLast week , the president overrode objections from GOP congressional leaders and sided with Democrats on a proposal to attach storm aid to measures to keep the government funded and its borrowing limit suspended until mid-December . Some Republicans fear their own internal divisions and trouble passing health care and other legislation are making Democrats a more appealing negotiating partner for Mr. Trump . Republicans are a group full of \u201c independent-minded folks that have no problem going in a different direction , \u201d who still \u201c need to demonstrate that we can govern , \u201d said Rep. Bill Huizenga ( R. , Mich. ) \u201c Maybe this is a wake-up call from the White House . \u201d\n\u201c The word \u2018 agreement \u2019 is a good thing around here , and we \u2019 re not very used to that , \u201d said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry ( R. , Neb. ) . \u201c The country is exhausted politically and sentiments about possibly getting things done are good . \u201d\nA hard line on immigration was one of the central components of Mr. Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign , and his administration has ramped up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants , sought to restrict travel from several countries and slashed admission of refugees . Last week , he followed through on a promise to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which now gives about 690,000 young illegal migrants work authorization and protection from deportation . At the same time , though , he urged Congress to find a solution for those affected before the protections expire in six months .\n\u201c Does anybody really want to throw out good , educated and accomplished young people who have jobs , some serving in the military ? Really ! \u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday .\nThat attitude stands in contrast to that of his attorney general , Jeff Sessions , a longtime backer of immigration curbs , who announced the decision to end DACA . He described the program as not just an overreach of executive authority on the part of former President Barack Obama , who created it , but as a wrongheaded move that had encouraged illegal immigration and taken jobs from Americans \u201c by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs . \u201d\nDemocrats saw their power on the rise in a Congress in which they control neither chamber , and the party \u2019 s leaders appeared to be enjoying the moment . Still , some reacted with skepticism . \u201c There \u2019 s not a deal until we see it in writing and there \u2019 s a vote on it , \u201d said Rep.

Among them is whether the young people being protected would get the chance for citizenship or a legal status short of that . The details of border security would also need to be settled . Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said Thursday that the border-security measures could include new technology , drones , air support , sensor equipment and rebuilt roads along the border . Mr. Trump said he wants \u201c extreme security , not only surveillance but everything that goes with surveillance . \u201d\nMr. Trump said on a visit to Florida Thursday that \u201c we \u2019 re not looking at citizenship , \u201d but Mrs. Pelosi said their discussion with Mr. Trump involved movement on the proposed Dream Act , legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for some of the childhood arrivals .\nRep. Mark Meadows ( R. , N.C. ) , chairman of the House Freedom Caucus , a group of conservative lawmakers , suggested the most problematic part of a deal could be providing the young immigrants a path to citizenship . \u201c It \u2019 s a problem for the majority of the Republican conference on citizenship , \u201d he said Thursday .\nMore generally , the deal faces sharp opposition from conservatives who helped power Mr. Trump to office and felt betrayed by the move . The right-wing website Breitbart , run by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon , called the emerging agreement a \u201c full-fledged cave. \u201d Conservative writer Ann Coulter asked on Twitter , \u201c At this point , who DOESN \u2019 T want Trump impeached ? \u201d Opponents immediately labeled the deal \u201c amnesty . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s only one thing that cracks President Trump \u2019 s base and that \u2019 s if he cracks on immigration , \u201d said Rep.
