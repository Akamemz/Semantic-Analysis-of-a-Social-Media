Its early failures made the tough challenge of launching the markets appear insurmountable .\nAt a series of committee hearings in recent weeks , Democratic legislators joined Republicans in lambasting the Obama administration for the malfunctioning website .

''\nHowever , the biggest disruption to date -- cancellation notices to a small percentage of Americans after Obama repeatedly promised they could keep coverage they liked -- provided strong ammunition for strong GOP attacks that put the President and Democrats on defense .\n`` Despite Democrats ' promises , millions of families are losing their insurance , losing access to their doctors , or being forced to pay more for insurance , '' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday in trying to link the issue to a stronger-than-expected October jobs report . `` Their household economies are taking a hit , and Obamacare has made life more uncertain for them .

''\nAt the same time , she echoed the administration 's argument that most of the individual policy holders getting cancellation notices will get a better deal under Obamacare .\n`` Many people may find better plans in the marketplaces that offer superior coverage for them at a good value and at a potentially lower cost , '' she said in the statement . `` But if people want to keep their current plans , they should be able to do so .

Joining the federal program would mean fewer uninsured people going to emergency rooms for their health care , which Obama said resulted in a `` hidden tax '' because hospitals pass the resulting extra costs on to everyone else .\n`` It 's the right thing to do for the health of our economies as a whole , '' he said . `` It is a practical , pragmatic reason to do it that has nothing to do with politics or ideology . ''\nIn Washington , meanwhile , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued a subpoena for the administration to turn over enrollment figures so far by Friday .\nSebelius has said the first figures would be released next week , and there was no sign her department would budge .\nThe GOP push for figures seeks to cast the botched rollout of the Obamacare website in the worst possible light . Sebelius and Carney have tried to downplay expectations by repeatedly saying the initial figures would be lower than expected .\nBoth Obama and Sebelius repeatedly emphasize that the website problems have prevented consumers from getting the information they need about coverage options , possible government subsidies and other details that they insist would alleviate concerns .\nAt the Senate hearing Wednesday , Sebelius implied without directly saying so that Republicans were failing to properly inform their constituents about the health care reforms .\n`` I think that it is always welcome to have elected officials in their home states give information to constituents about what the law says , what their options are , what their benefits could be , what choices they have , and how to access the process , '' she said .",

The administration opposes any delay, even as it considers specific steps to help people facing canceled policies, and it was unlikely that any legislation that included major changes to Obamacare would pass the Senate or get signed by the President.\n\n\"Delaying the Affordable Care Act wouldn't delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's,\" Sebelius told a Senate committee this week, adding that \"for for millions of Americans, delay is not an option. People's lives depend on this.\"\n\nGOP scorched earth tactics\n\nThe upcoming elections aside, Democrats also are contending with the no-holds-barred opposition by Republicans who seek any opportunity to call for getting rid of the health care reforms despised by Republicans.\n\nGoing back to the debate on Obamacare that started in 2009, GOP legislators have fought it in committees and in both the House and Senate, with zero Republicans supporting the Affordable Care Act when it passed in 2010.\n\nRepublican attorneys general helped mount the unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge against the reforms, and some GOP governors now have rejected federal money under Obamacare to expand Medicaid coverage for indigent people lacking health insurance.\n\nObama criticized such resistance at speeches this week in two GOP-led states that have rejected the Medicaid expansion -- Texas and Louisiana. Joining the federal program would mean fewer uninsured people going to emergency rooms for their health care, which Obama said resulted in a \"hidden tax\" because hospitals pass the resulting extra costs on to everyone else.\n\n\"It's the right thing to do for the health of our economies as a whole,\" he said. \"It is a practical, pragmatic reason to do it that has nothing to do with politics or ideology.\"\n\nIn Washington, meanwhile, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued a subpoena for the administration to turn over enrollment figures so far by Friday.\n\nSebelius has said the first figures would be released next week, and there was no sign her department would budge.\n\nThe GOP push for figures seeks to cast the botched rollout of the Obamacare website in the worst possible light. Sebelius and Carney have tried to downplay expectations by repeatedly saying the initial figures would be lower than expected.\n\nBoth Obama and Sebelius repeatedly emphasize that the website problems have prevented consumers from getting the information they need about coverage options, possible government subsidies and other details that they insist would alleviate concerns.\n\nAt the Senate hearing Wednesday, Sebelius implied without directly saying so that Republicans were failing to properly inform their constituents about the health care reforms.\n\n\"I think that it is always welcome to have elected officials in their home states give information to constituents about what the law says, what their options are, what their benefits could be, what choices they have, and how to access the process,\" she said.",
