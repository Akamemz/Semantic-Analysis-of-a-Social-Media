Nadler reiterated that House Democrats would fight to obtain the full findings of Mueller\u2019s 21-month probe, including by congressional subpoena or lawsuit, if the Justice Department balks at turning over the report and the underlying evidence.\n\nIn a signal that House Democrats aren\u2019t counting on having all their suspicions put to rest by the report that Mueller is completing, Nadler\u2019s requests include one to the FBI for all documents relating to the May 2017 firing of Comey and communications from Trump or his representatives concerning former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s recusal \u201cfrom any investigation related to the 2016 Presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nThe request to Weisselberg, the Trump Organization executive, included demands for \u201cany present or emolument of any kind whatever\u201d to Trump, family members or his businesses after he won the 2016 presidential election. It also asks about plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow or any other possible real estate deal in Russia by Trump or the Trump Organization.\n\nBroader Questions\n\nThe Judiciary Committee chairman said there are much broader questions and concerns about whether Trump, through some of his actions, is undermining \u201cthe rule of law\u201d -- a reference to established and defined limits on the arbitrary exercise of power.\n\nNadler\u2019s document requests ensure that the probe of Trump, his family and his inner circle will continue for months if not years, even if Mueller\u2019s findings -- which Trump has branded a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d -- don\u2019t find evidence of collusion with Russia by those around Trump or obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nNadler plans to hold public hearings on the information and material obtained, though witnesses haven\u2019t yet been determined.\n\nNadler\u2019s investigative plans were in place last week, even before Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, testified publicly before the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in private before the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nHush Money\n\nCohen told lawmakers Wednesday that Trump directed Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the 2016 campaign, that Trump Jr. had a role in the payments, and that Trump had deflated the value of some of his properties to lower his tax payments.\n\nCohen\u2019s appearances have since led several other committees to announce their own next steps at looking into Trump\u2019s businesses and charity, including seeking his tax returns, collecting more documents, holding hearings and calling witnesses for testimony.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland suggested that his panel will pursue interviews with Trump associates that Cohen mentioned in his testimony or were found in records he provided to his committee, possibly including Trump\u2019s children.\n\nTrump Associates\n\nAnd Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California has said his panel will hold a March 14 hearing with former with Trump associate Felix Sater, who helped him develop a hotel. Weisselberg also will appear before Schiff\u2019s committee for an interview, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThere is an impatient clamor by some Democrats for impeachment and hesitancy by others who want to wait for the Mueller report to even discuss it.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland says he\u2019s not convinced Democrats will pursue impeachment.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is dragging the GOP down to defeat,\u201d Raskin said in a recent interview. \u201cTo impeach Donald Trump now is to offer a big helping hand to the Republicans, partly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Margaret Talev, and Jennifer Jacobs",
