I conceive that if any power whatsoever is in its nature executive , it is the power of appointing , overseeing , and controlling those who execute the laws. \u201d In Myers v. U.S. ( 1926 ) , the Supreme Court observed \u201c it was natural , therefore , for those who framed our Constitution to regard the words \u2018 executive power \u2019 as including \u201d the power to remove executive officers .\nA regulation issued by the Justice Department should not be read to limit the president \u2019 s constitutional power to remove officers . Otherwise , a mere cabinet officer could prevent future presidents from exercising the constitutional authorities of their office . The chief executive commands the attorney general , not the other way around .\nA bipartisan group of senators are currently mulling a proposal to prevent the president from firing Mr. Mueller except for cause , and to allow the courts to review his removal .
