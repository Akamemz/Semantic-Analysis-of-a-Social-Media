    "content": "The WikiLeaks emails reveal a Hillary Clinton campaign team fixated on climate change \u2014 yet reluctant to make overly sweeping promises about what they \u2019 d do about it .\nCampaign chairman John Podesta \u2019 s hacked inbox offers a veritable road map to the energy policy that Clinton would execute in the White House , as well as clear lessons to the environmental and industry groups that are getting ready to lobby her administration if she wins . And climate change and related issues feature prominently in the approximately 25,000 messages WikiLeaks has released so far from Podesta \u2019 s account .\n\u201c Climate change \u201d comes up in more than 1,200 of the emails released as of Friday , or more than Obamacare and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant combined \u2014 and almost as many as the 1,444 emails that mention the name \u201c Sanders . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s energy proposals have produced fewer easy sound bites than Bernie Sanders \u2019 call to ban fracking or Donald Trump \u2019 s promises to put coal miners back to work . But the hacked emails , dating from before and after Podesta joined the campaign after serving as a senior adviser to the Obama White House , show Clinton \u2019 s team to be as driven by policy details and the power of pragmatic messaging as the candidate herself \u2014 while grappling with the contradictions inherent in a campaign year when grandiose promises are more popular than realistic proposals .\nTaxing carbon polls horribly , her advisers fret , but politicians will need to get behind some climate plan to drastically reduce carbon output . Natural gas has spurred jobs and exports , but it produces methane pollution that cries out for regulation . The federal ethanol mandate is arguably failing to deliver its promised gains for national security and the planet , as one aide wrote last year , but calling for reform too loudly risks losing support in corn country .\nAnd Clinton \u2019 s team think it \u2019 s deeply unrealistic to call for a quick end to oil drilling , as some green groups and Sanders supporters demand \u2014 but it \u2019 s also fanciful to think that the current U.S. oil boom should continue indefinitely .\nSeveral threads in the emails also detail the choreography Clinton \u2019 s aides engaged in before she revealed her long-planned public opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline last year .\nAmong the biggest themes contained in the emails : Like Obama , Clinton wants the left to push her .\nPresident Barack Obama accepted his nomination for reelection in 2012 with a call for \u201c shared responsibility , \u201d effectively reminding liberals dissatisfied with his record at that point that it was their job to lobby him in their direction . Green activists listened and kept pushing . They cheered as Obama sloughed off the \u201c all-of-the-above \u201d energy rhetoric of his first term and spent significant political capital on global warming , from regulations on power plants to the recently ratified Paris climate deal .\nThe Clinton team whose private discussions WikiLeaks is dragging into public view appears in the mold of Obama , wary of unrealistic proposals from the left but ready to engage with critics who want more .\nThe presidential front-runner \u2019 s private quip that anti-fossil fuel activists should \u201c get a life , \u201d seen in context , reads like more of a rejoinder to remove their heads from the clouds than a personal slam .\nThe heat of the Democratic primary produced its share of clashes within the front-runner \u2019 s campaign .\nOn the one hand , Clinton aides teed off on Sanders \u2019 proposed fracking ban as \u201c extreme , unfeasible \u201d and disconnected from the economic benefits of increased U.S. natural gas production . On the other hand , they responded when forced to reckon with a data-driven case from the environmental left . When Clinton aide Josh Schwerin suggested slamming primary rival Martin O \u2019 Malley for urging an end to all fossil-fuel use by 2050 , Podesta overruled him with the admonition that \u201c close to a zero carbon energy sector \u201d is needed to make good on the nation \u2019 s pledges for massive cuts in greenhouse gases .\nThe emails also show that at least some communications went on between the environmental left and the Clinton campaign .\nLucy Waletzky , a Clinton donor , physician and member of the Rockefeller family , asked the campaign in February for \u201c more commitments \u201d to address the health effects of fracking , the technology behind the oil and gas boom . And a few exchanges show Podesta sought to use green mega-donor Tom Steyer to reach out to Bill McKibben , a top leader of the climate protest movement . After the president \u2019 s former Harvard Law School mentor Laurence Tribe harshly criticized the Obama administration \u2019 s climate rule for power plants , Podesta wrote to Steyer asking him to \u201c get your pall [ sic ] McKibben to organize Harvard student protests against him . \u201d\nWaletzky told \u2588\u2588\u2588 she has \u201c a lot of confidence \u201d that Clinton would be able to rein in fracking , even though \u201c she can \u2019 t do all of what any one person might want. \u201d And she acknowledged that overturning a George W. Bush-era restriction on fracking regulations \u2014 the so-called Halliburton loophole , which Clinton often pledges to end \u2014 is \u201c not going to happen \u201d given its breadth of industry and GOP support .\nMcKibben argues that the emails contain no surprises and should motivate green activists to keep up the fight after Election Day . \u201c The honeymoon won \u2019 t last 10 minutes ; on November 9 we \u2019 ll be organizing for science and human rights and against the timid incrementalism that marks her approach , \u201d he wrote in The Nation this week .\nThe emails also shed light on Clinton \u2019 s cautious approach to issues that carry special weight with key constituencies or split public opinion , which her team of pollsters painstakingly tracks .\nEven as the campaign treads carefully around issues without clear public support , it works to avoid getting pinned down in areas where a future deal could be cut .\nConsider the federal ethanol mandate , a sacrosanct policy in farm states like Iowa that Clinton has vowed to protect amid increasing criticism from both the oil industry and environmentalists .\nInterest in shaping Clinton \u2019 s stance on the ethanol rule is so keen that its defenders were rattled when news reports emerged this summer about her campaign meeting with a critic of the policy . But on two occasions , the emails show the campaign working hard to keep its options open .\nAfter then-White House climate adviser Dan Utech advised Clinton \u2019 s aides in April 2015 to talk about \u201c making the [ ethanol rule ] more effective , \u201d Podesta dubbed that careful phrase \u201c the reform graph . \u201d\nAnother Clinton aide , Dan Schwerin , proposed another tweak to the language to leave \u201c maximum flexibility down the road . \u201d\nThe following month , Schwerin forwarded a news report on \u201c Clinton \u2019 s Mend-It-Don \u2019 t-End-It \u201d ethanol strategy and added : \u201c I \u2019 d say we successfully \u2018 threaded the needle \u2019 yet again ! \u201d\nA similar cautiousness on a carbon tax is evident from the emails . Clinton \u2019 s pollsters found last year that the policy is especially susceptible to attack , even as a majority of voters say they want immediate action on climate change . Support for a carbon tax whose revenue would be rebated to offset higher energy costs started with 58 percent support , compared with 35 percent opposition in a March 2015 poll conducted for Clinton \u2019 s campaign . But after pollsters tested arguments for and against the proposal , support led opposition by just 1 percentage point .\n\u201c [ W ] e have done extensive polling on carbon tax , \u201d Podesta told Clinton policy director Jake Sullivan before the poll was conducted . \u201c It all sucks . \u201d\nPolicy advisers included a greenhouse gas fee among the options they outlined for Clinton to build on Obama \u2019 s climate agenda in a detailed March 2015 memo . But they were forthright about its limitations and offered a more modest approach that the candidate ultimately embraced , which calls for rewarding states and cities that pursue ambitious emissions cuts .\nOn two other , more niche environmental issues , the WikiLeaks emails show Podesta keeping abreast of how best to promote climate-hawkish policies .\nIn March 2015 , veteran environmental lawyer Richard Ayres sent Podesta a summary of a legal battle green groups were waging to temporarily suspend the federal coal leasing program in order to subject it to a new , full-scale environmental review . It would take another 10 months for the Obama administration to embrace that review on its own , and Clinton was ready by then to stand behind a decision that infuriated a coal industry whose workers she has struggled to woo .\nLater that year , Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp thanked Podesta \u201c for reaching out \u201d on methane and passed along messaging as well as policy advice on regulating the oil and gas industry \u2019 s emissions of the potent greenhouse gas .\nThe emails also show a potential for some 2015-style deal-making on energy policy .\nWhen congressional Republicans escalated their push to repeal the decades-old ban on crude oil exports during last year \u2019 s government funding talks , environmentalists howled that the policy amounted to little more than a bailout for the industry .\nBut Clinton publicly stayed open to allowing exports if an agreement could \u201c strike the right balance. \u201d In the emails , she barely adjusted that stance even after Congress and the White House cut a deal that lifted the ban and included a five-year extension and phase-out of green-energy tax credits .\nA debate handbook from December , released by WikiLeaks , recommended that Clinton praise the year-end exports deal if it came up , while lamenting that she \u201c would have liked to see real concessions from the oil and gas industry . \u201d\nCoupled with Clinton \u2019 s predilection for pragmatism and her past support for the geopolitical benefits of gas exports during her corporate speeches , her careful messaging on the exports-for-tax-credits deal suggests that she \u2019 d be looking to cut more bargains in that vein if she \u2019 s elected .\nWhile Clinton may have mocked environmentalists in private remarks to union members , newly public excerpts from her other previously private speeches show that she frequently caveats her support for new energy infrastructure with a recognition of the environmental consequences of fossil fuel development .\n\u201c I 'm not crazy about the consequences of natural gas with the release of methane but it is replacing coal , \u201d she says in an excerpt from a February 2014 speech at the University of Miami .\n\u201c Now , that is a tremendous opportunity , as long as we are smart about it , \u201d Clinton told a San Diego law firm in September 2014 . \u201c And we have to start by being smart about making sure we extract oil and gas in ways that do n't destroy water tables , leak methane into the air , undermine the quality of life for people who live near the wells . \u201d\nPerhaps the least shocking development outlined in the hacked emails is the campaign \u2019 s struggles to prevent rebellion among building trade unions that supported Keystone . Yet that dynamic has only intensified this year as Clinton stays out of activists \u2019 fight to block the Dakota Access pipeline , whose fate has become an even bigger worry for the oil industry than Keystone \u2019 s was .\nNikki Budzinski , Clinton \u2019 s labor outreach director , asked colleagues in February if the candidate could craft a pipeline policy that would let her avoid falling prey to the project-by-project grassroots lobbying strategy that green groups have used against fossil fuel infrastructure .\n\u201c She has privately told the building trades that she does not oppose pipelines , \u201d Budzinski wrote . \u201c Can we outline instances where a pipeline would have her support ? \u201d\nClinton never released such a blanket statement on pipelines at the time , but she has called for repair and replacement of aging fossil-fuel infrastructure . If she wins the White House , that won \u2019 t be enough to mollify emboldened environmentalists , a frustrated oil and gas industry or concerned labor unions .\nThe emails show little sign of engagement between the campaign and the oil industry , however . The American Petroleum Institute makes a brief cameo when Podesta cites its \u201c very negative reaction \u201d to the May 2015 release of three years \u2019 worth of proposed regulatory targets on ethanol .\nPodesta also flagged a group of \u201c really problematic \u201d oil and gas advisers , who carried largely establishment ties , in April 2015 .",
