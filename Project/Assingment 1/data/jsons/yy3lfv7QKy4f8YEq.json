    "content": "According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , the framework calls for about $ 5.8 trillion in tax cuts over a decade and includes about $ 3.6 trillion in revenue-raising provisions ; that leaves a net cut of $ 2.2 trillion . Senate Republicans are eyeing a plan that would allow $ 1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade .\n\u201c There \u2019 s never been tax cuts like what we \u2019 re talking about , \u201d Mr. Trump , a Republican , said during a speech in Indiana in which he said the plan would boost economic growth and lead to a \u201c middle-class miracle . \u201d\nWith many tough decisions about who wins and who loses left to be sorted out by lawmakers , the release of the plan marks the beginning of what likely will be months of tugging and pulling among lawmakers , lobbyists and the administration to reshape the way the federal government taxes businesses and individuals .\nBattles could ensue about a proposal to limit deductions that businesses are now allowed for interest on their debt and about the repeal of the state and local tax deduction . That last change has opponents among House Republicans in New York , New Jersey and California , whose votes GOP leaders will likely need .\nA great deal is at stake for the White House and congressional Republicans , who have spent months trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act without success . They are eager for a signature legislative win to make their mark on the U.S. economy and position themselves for the 2018 midterm elections . \u201c For all of us , this is a now-or-never moment , \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) said .\nMany Republicans expressed optimism Wednesday . But tax policy is notoriously thorny . Congress hasn \u2019 t overhauled the tax system in such an ambitious manner since 1986 .\n\u201c If we can \u2019 t get this done , then frankly what can we do ? \u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R. , Fla. ) said .\nDemocrats , many of whom bashed the proposal as full of benefits for the richest households , are unlikely to give Republicans much help in passing a tax bill , forcing the GOP to work within its narrow majorities in the House and Senate .\n\u201c When Donald Trump was talking about his plan in the last few days , he talked about the middle class and not helping the wealthy , \u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the chamber \u2019 s Democratic leader . \u201c The plan is a major disappointment because it so deviates from everything the president said . \u201d\nThe plan will move through Congress over the next few months . Lawmakers will first attempt to write a budget resolution that would allow the subsequent tax bill to pass on a simple-majority vote in the Senate . Then , the House and Senate will release the tax details .\nWednesday \u2019 s framework , written by six top negotiators from the House , Senate and Trump administration , calls for a 20 % corporate tax rate , down from 35 % today . Other companies , which pay their taxes through the individual returns of their owners , would get a 25 % top rate with unspecified rules that would prevent wealthy business owners from paying that rate on what is considered wage income .\nBusinesses could immediately deduct capital investments , except for buildings , for at least five years , instead of depreciating them over time as is the case today . The move is meant to spur spending on new machines and the workers needed to run them .\n\u201c This is a supply-side approach that is going to lower the cost of capital , encourage investment , make America the best place in the world to invest money , and in the process we \u2019 re going to create incentives to expand America \u2019 s productive capacity , \u201d Sen. Pat Toomey ( R. , Pa. ) said .\nIndividual tax rates would be set at 12 % , 25 % and 35 % , with the option of a fourth higher rate on the highest-income households . The plan would repeal the alternative minimum tax and estate tax , a declaration that drew cheers at the House GOP retreat , according to a person in the room .\nThe tax cut for business investment , if approved by Congress , would be retroactive to Wednesday , but most of the other changes wouldn \u2019 t be retroactive , a senior administration official said .\nThe framework\u2014light on some critical details\u2014left it difficult for taxpayers to calculate exactly how they would fare .\nThe plan lays out new individual tax brackets , but it doesn \u2019 t say at what income thresholds those brackets would apply . The child tax credit would be increased , but it isn \u2019 t clear by how much .\nMany lower- and middle-income households could benefit from the plan \u2019 s proposal to nearly double the basic standard deduction to $ 12,000 for individuals and $ 24,000 for married couples . But the elimination of the $ 4,050 personal exemption would take back much of that benefit .\nUnder current law , because of the personal exemption and standard deduction , a married couple with two children doesn \u2019 t pay taxes on the first $ 28,900 of income . That is bigger than the $ 24,000 standard deduction they would get under the proposal .\nBut the plan also calls for significantly increasing the child tax credit , which could prevent that family from seeing a tax increase . And it doesn \u2019 t offer details on how big the credit would be or whether it would be fully refundable . Two Republican senators , Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida , said Wednesday the credit should at least be doubled .\nAdministration officials said that some families making under $ 100,000 and taking the standard deduction could save $ 1,000 a year . But within hours of the document \u2019 s release , groups allied with Democrats circulated scenarios in which low-income households and senior citizens could instead see their taxes rise .\nGregg Polsky , a tax-law professor at the University of Georgia , said the increase in the standard deduction , combined with the elimination of state and local tax deductibility , would give many households less incentive to itemize their tax deductions , making provisions like a mortgage-interest deduction less appealing .\nMarried taxpayers would have to have at least $ 24,000 in combined mortgage interest and charitable deductions to get any benefit at all from itemizing , something that has charities and real-estate agents concerned .\n\u201c It keeps the mortgage deduction in name , but in practice only people with very large charitable contributions or million-dollar homes will benefit from it , \u201d Mr. Polsky said .\nThe plan doesn \u2019 t say how big a tax cut the Trump administration favors , but a senior administration official said the president would stand behind a Senate plan that would allow for a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut over the next decade .\nRepublicans said that faster economic growth will help the cuts at least partly pay for themselves over time and limit the impact of the changes on deficits and the national debt , which recently crossed $ 20 trillion . But just how much tax cuts affect growth is a point of disagreement among economists .\nMr. Trump , who had long favored a 15 % corporate tax rate , has two bright red lines as the debate goes forward , the senior administration official said . The president wants to stick to the 20 % corporate rate and wants to make sure the plan includes a middle-class tax cut .\nThe framework allows for an additional top tax rate on individuals above 35 % , \u201c to ensure that the reformed tax code is at least as progressive as the existing tax code and does not shift the tax burden from high-income to lower- and middle-income taxpayers . \u201d\nMr. Trump said high-income households , including his own , wouldn \u2019 t benefit . Mr. Trump has said his net worth is more than $ 10 billion . His children would presumably benefit from an estate-tax repeal . He also has declined to release his tax returns , making it impossible to see how he would fare .\nA late-September Republican tax proposal called for nearly doubling the basic standard deduction to $ 12,000 for individuals and $ 24,000 for married couples . An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the deductions would be doubled .
