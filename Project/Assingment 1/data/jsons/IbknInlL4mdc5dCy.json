    "content": "One of them is the official presidency of Donald Trump , leader of the Republican Party , driver of the legislative agenda , head of the executive branch .\nA year in , that presidency looks surprisingly normal . Trump has largely outsourced his agenda to the congressional GOP and their allies inside his administration . As a result , he has pursued policies similar to what Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush might have pursued : repeal of Obamacare , tax cuts for corporations , deregulation for the energy industry . When he goes to Davos \u2014 and , note , he goes to Davos ! \u2014 he gives the kind of speech any Republican might give at Davos .\nIdeologically disruptive forces like Steve Bannon have been forcibly ejected from Trump \u2019 s orbit , and the president himself has abandoned his more heterodox views on taxes , trade , health care , and China . Trump remains an immigration hardliner , but of a sort that has long been represented within the Republican Party .\nTrump \u2019 s opponents can take comfort in their success at resisting and wounding this incarnation of Trump \u2019 s White House . Given the economy \u2019 s performance and the GOP \u2019 s dominance of Congress , it is surprising how little the Trump administration has achieved , and how steep the price has been . The effort to repeal Obamacare was a debacle . The tax cuts passed , but they passed while polling in the 20s and 30s \u2014 a disaster given that the policy , at least in its early years , is designed to shovel free money at families and corporations .\nA comparison of Gallup tracking polls shows the severity of the GOP \u2019 s problems : At about this point in Obama \u2019 s presidency , with a brutal 9.9 percent unemployment rate , 50 percent of the country approved of Obama \u2019 s job performance ; Trump , with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate , is polling at 39 percent . The toxicity is spreading through Trump \u2019 s party too : Democrats are up by more than 7 percentage points in polls asking Americans whom they will support in the next congressional election .\n\u201c He is a highly divisive figure , \u201d says George Edwards , a political scientist at Texas A & M who studies presidential rhetoric . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t convince anyone on the other side . He doesn \u2019 t move the public . He can not reach out beyond people already committed to him . \u201d\nBut there is another Trump presidency \u2014 that of Donald J. Trump , reality television star and international brand . This is the presidency that I suspect matters more to Trump himself , the one that he pursues during his morning \u201c executive time , \u201d the one he furthers with every tweet , the one he obsessively monitors on cable news . This is the presidency for which the measures of achievement aren \u2019 t bills passed or jobs created but headlines grabbed and mindshare held .\nThis is the presidency that , for all its collateral damage , is succeeding beyond Trump \u2019 s wildest dreams . This is the presidency that few have figured out how to resist .\nThe secret to Trump \u2019 s success , the insight that has separated him from his competitors , is that he has cared less about the nature of the coverage he received than that he received coverage at all .\n\u201c Even a critical story , which may be hurtful personally , can be very valuable to your business , \u201d Trump said in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal . He goes on to recall the lesson he learned being attacked for a particularly gaudy skyscraper he sought to build . \u201c The point , \u201d he says , \u201c is that we got a lot of attention , and that alone creates value . \u201d\nThis is the law by which Trump lives his life . Attention creates value , at least for him . Before Trump , every politician hewed to the same basic rule : You want as much positive coverage , and as little negative coverage , as possible . Trump upended that .\nHis rule , his realization , is that you want as much coverage as possible , full stop . If it \u2019 s positive coverage , great . If it \u2019 s negative coverage , so be it . The point is that it \u2019 s coverage \u2014 that you \u2019 re the story , that you \u2019 re squeezing out your competitors , that you \u2019 re on people \u2019 s minds .\nThis was Trump \u2019 s true political innovation : He realized that presidential campaigns \u2014 and particularly presidential primaries \u2014 had become reality shows , and the path to victory was to get the most attention , even if much of that attention was negative .\nIn this , Trump either intuited or stumbled into a profound insight about the media : It \u2019 s easier to get bad press than good press . There is an old line about the media : We don \u2019 t cover the planes that land safely . Most politicians try to get media coverage while landing the plane safely . They stage photo ops at factories , give prepared statements , deliver carefully crafted speeches . The result is dull , predictable , normal \u2014 and ignored .\nTrump dominates news cycle after news cycle by crashing planes into Twitter . He is everywhere , seemingly all the time . He says things no national politician in history would have dared say , things that the press covers because they are outrageous , controversial , unnerving , appalling .\nTrump is demanding and receiving our attention , crowding out everything else , accepting that it \u2019 s better to be hated than to be ignored .\n\u201c There is a range of Trump coverage and attention that a conventional politician would find devastating that Trump finds exhilarating , \u201d says Ron Klain , who served as chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden .\nEvery so often , someone will suggest that we just ignore Trump \u2019 s words , his riffs , his tweets . But Trump controls a nuclear arsenal . His tweets are \u201c considered official statements by the president of the United States , \u201d according to Sean Spicer , who served as Trump \u2019 s first press secretary .\nThese are words that start wars , that drive deportations , that set policy , that end negotiations , that empower bigots , that reveal scandals , that represent our country . That the president of the United States is acting outrageously , or worryingly , or offensively , is important . As much as Trump might treat his presidency like a reality show , it remains a presidency , and lives are in the balance .\nYet in owning our attention , in driving the agenda , in setting both the terms and tone of the debate , and in doing so by generating constant negative attention , cultural conflict , and emotional alarm , Trump makes us a little more like him , and politics a little more like the tribal clash he says it is .\nTwo weeks ago , Trump , after much fanfare , held his \u201c Fake News Awards. \u201d He had teased the event on Twitter for weeks , sending journalists into paroxysms of mockery and frustration . This was , as so much is with Trump , an exercise that was simultaneously ridiculous and dangerous , comic and illiberal . The \u201c awards \u201d turned out to be complaints about stories Trump had already complained about , tied to a fundraising plea for the Republican Party .\nIn response , many in the media played into his hands , joking that it was an honor just to be considered , lamenting that they didn \u2019 t win , acting out of anger and exhaustion more like the opposition party he says we are .\n\u201c It says so much about our current media moment that the president would announce plans to shame news organizations with his first-annual \u2018 Fake News Awards \u2019 and every reporter would be praying to God they made the list , \u201d wrote Kyle Pope , the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review .\nTrump drives his opponents to respond in kind , to adopt just a little more of his tone and language and pitch . Twitter swells with jabs and nicknames , cries of \u201c Sad ! \u201d and \u201c Fake news ! \u201d Even when it doesn \u2019 t succumb to that behavior , the media is laser-focused on Trump \u2019 s words , behavior , decisions , grievances . America ends up having the fights Trump wants us to have .\nTrump understands this power . He knows he can wrest the news cycle back at a moment \u2019 s notice . In September , amidst Puerto Rico \u2019 s misery and bad news for the GOP \u2019 s congressional agenda , Trump lashed out at kneeling NFL protestors , creating a multi-week firestorm that didn \u2019 t have policy stakes , but drove a deep wedge into our cultural divisions .\nSports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country . NFL should change policy ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 24 , 2017\nThe whole episode was , again , a mixture the surreal and the scary . Here was the President of the United States choosing to ignite a racialized controversy , telling the mostly white attendees at his rallies that \u201c people like yourselves \u201d shouldn \u2019 t have to see \u201c those people \u201d kneeling during the anthem . Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to an NFL game with instructions to walk out if the players kneeled \u2014 which was exactly what happened . It was a transparent effort to distract us , to inflame our divisions , to lure us to have the fight Trump wanted to have rather than continue discussing his flailing governance .\nAnd yet it worked . Coverage of this was everywhere \u2014 it dominated not just the political press , but also sports media . Trump \u2019 s opponents were angry \u2014 the president was a racist , he was dismissing police brutality , he was turning us against each other . His supporters were indignant \u2014 the president was a patriot , he was defending the flag and the country . There were takes , late-night comedy bits , searching interviews , angry tweets , earnest explainers .\nBy the time Trump was done , the NFL , which had previously been viewed favorably by both Democratic and Republican voters , had become one of the most divisive brands in the US . Trump had successfully made us angrier at each other , he had absorbed more of American life into the tribalized war of our politics and he had done so on his terms .\nThe NFL skirmish was one of many clashes Trump caused during his first year in office . As this analysis from Echelon Insights shows , Trump dominated the national conversation on almost every day of 2017 , and that was true no matter whether you looked at liberals or conservatives or political elites or everyone . The mindshare he occupies , the energy he consumes , is vast :\nI say none of this from atop a soapbox . I am as guilty of it as anyone , and more guilty of it than most .\nI find it hard to resist commenting on Trump \u2019 s tweets . I find it hard to tear myself away from his daily outrages , even when I know they \u2019 re less important than other things I could cover . I find it hard not to respond to him in kind , not to let his language , his energy , his approach , infect mine .\nPart of the cost is political . Trump sees the world as zero-sum tribal warfare , and the way he operates , the way he acts , the rage and fear and shock he calls forth in his opponents , makes it more so . As my colleague Matt Yglesias observes , this seems , on the margins , to work for Trump \u2014 his approval ratings rise slightly in periods in which the news is dominated by angry clashes over his behavior , and fall when the story turns back to the more ordinary outrages of his policy agenda .\nPart of the cost is social . Keeping politics at this pitch for four years is a terrible strain on an already divided country . Dozens of news stories have recorded psychologists reporting patients streaming into their office with Trump-related anxiety . Trump is deepening the threats we feel \u2014 and , in some cases , the threats we truly face \u2014 from each other ; he is breaking us into warring factions in the hopes that that collision will strengthen his supporters \u2019 loyalty to him .\nSome of it is an opportunity cost \u2014 there are so many other conversations we could be having , so many other stories we could be covering . It is hard , amid Trump , to see beyond Trump \u2014 to the technological changes transforming our society , to the international forces reshaping our world , to the leaders and doers who are building a better future .\nThere is a section of Michael Wolff \u2019 s Fire and Fury that has stuck with me .
