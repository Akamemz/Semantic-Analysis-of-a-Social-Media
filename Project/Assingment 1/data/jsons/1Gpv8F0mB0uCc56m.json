That 's double the current capacity , and right in time for an expected surge in demand just before the end of the year .\nThe second came from the pro-reform group Families USA , which examined options available to 15 million people who are currently covered on the individual market ( many of whose policies have been canceled and will lapse by the end of the year ) under the Affordable Care Act .\nAccording to Families USA , over 70 percent of those currently insured will either qualify for premium tax credits on state-based insurance exchanges , or become newly eligible for Medicaid coverage under the healthcare law .\n`` Nationally , 71 percent of people in the individual market under age 65 have incomes at or below 400 percent of poverty , '' according to Families USA . `` Under the Affordable Care Act , these people are income-eligible for financial help to purchase an insurance plan , either through new premium tax credit subsidies or through expanded Medicaid . ''\nTogether that combines all of the ingredients any marketplace needs to be successful :\nThis is particularly excellent news for the 5-or-so million people whose existing policies are about to lapse . Many of them were n't aware that the Affordable Care Act offered them comparable or better deals . But even if they were , they did n't have easy access to those deals if they lived in states with federally facilitated insurance exchanges . Healthcare.gov 's failure left even the most informed consumers without reliable access to replacement coverage . If the site had been working , the Families USA study suggests most of the people currently facing the prospect of a coverage gap would have actually been able to purchase similar or preferable alternatives right away .\nFor the past couple of months , the Healthcare.gov failure allowed Republicans to ignore the moral imperative they face to direct these constituents toward new options . The cash registers are n't working , they could tell themselves , so what good would we be doing by directing people to the market anyhow .
