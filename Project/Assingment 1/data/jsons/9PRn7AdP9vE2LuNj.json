Clinton \u2013 now President Obama \u2019 s loyal and steadfast secretary of state \u2013 complained about the Illinois insurgent spending \u201c millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods . \u201d\n\u201c But that \u2019 s Barack Obama , \u201d the ad \u2019 s narrator intones , before adding that the man who went on to win the presidency first attacked Clinton with \u201c vicious lies . \u201d\nThe ad also cites a Washington Post column from last month that denounced a particular Obama attack ad against Romney as \u201c misleading , unfair , and untrue . \u201d\nTough stuff \u2013 and the latest attempt by the Romney campaign to demonstrate that it intends to meet head-on the barrage of attacks it has faced on the candidate \u2019 s private-equity career at Bain Capital . The Obama ad denounced in the Post column was one that had suggested Romney outsourced American jobs overseas during his 15-year career at the Boston-based financial firm .\nThose Obama ads in turn relied on a Washington Post news article , published June 21 , that reported that six companies that Bain invested in during Romney \u2019 s tenure at the firm were \u201c pioneers \u201d in the emerging trend of outsourcing U.S. jobs to foreign countries like India and China .\nThe Romney campaign collected statements from the six companies \u2019 current and former CEOs , all of whom maintained that they had in fact added U.S. jobs during their respective periods of affiliation with Romney and Bain . They also said their reliance of foreign call centers and packaging plants was solely to support existing foreign sales of U.S. exports . After a meeting with the Post \u2019 s editorial board , in which the campaign demanded a retraction of the June 21 article , the paper announced it was standing by its reporting .\nThen the independent group FactCheck.org weighed in on the Obama ads , declaring \u201c we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney -- while he was still running Bain Capital -- shipped American jobs overseas .
