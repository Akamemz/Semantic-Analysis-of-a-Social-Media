    "content": "President Obama on Thursday nominated White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to be his next Treasury secretary , as the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee vowed to oppose the pick over a questionable statement Lew once made about the national debt .\nThe president said Thursday that he `` can not think of a better person '' to continue Geithner 's work . The announcement marked the president 's fourth major nomination to date of officials for his second-term administration .\n`` I trust his judgment , I value his friendship . I know very few people with greater integrity , '' Obama said . The president stressed Lew 's experience in both Washington and the private sector , and particularly his role presiding over `` three budget surpluses in a row '' while in the Clinton-era budget office .\nBut as with the prior nominations , Lew was drawing early criticism from the Republican side of the aisle .\n`` Jack Lew must never be secretary of Treasury , '' Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala. , ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee said , calling Lew 's comments nearly two years ago `` so outrageous and false '' as to disqualify him .\nSessions was referring to a bitter Senate hearing from February 2011 , when Lew attempted to defend statements he and Obama had made claiming their budget blueprint would get the country to a point where `` we 're not adding to the debt anymore . ''\nThose statements , at best , stretched the truth . The White House budget plan at the time showed the public debt ( which is n't the entire debt ) soaring from $ 11 trillion that year to nearly $ 19 trillion by 2021 , driven by year-after-year deficits .\nYet Lew , appearing at a Senate hearing , tried to justify the claim that the government was not adding to the debt . He said the administration was merely referring to `` primary balance '' -- or federal spending that does not count interest payments .\nHe repeated the claim before the Senate . `` Our spending will not add to the debt , '' Lew said . `` It 's an accurate statement . ''\nBut since interest payments are in fact a gigantic part of federal spending every year , Republican senators slammed Lew as `` dishonest '' for the claim . The website PolitiFact also rated the statement `` false '' at the time .\nThe White House later clarified that the debt would not increase as a share of the economy .\nSessions , though , said Lew 's comments stand as `` the most direct and important false assertion during my entire time in Washington . ''\nHe said the next Treasury secretary must be able to `` look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt . '' Sessions continued : `` Jack Lew is not that man . ''\nOther Republican senators said they would reserve judgment on Lew .\n`` It 's imperative that Mr. Lew outline the administration 's plans on tackling our unsustainable debt , what areas of federal spending should be cut , and what kind of reforms -- from our tax code to our entitlement programs -- are needed to get our fiscal house in order , '' Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , top Republican on the finance committee , said . He said he wants to hear more before deciding whether to support Lew .\nLew would not come into the job with the same type of financial experience as Geithner , who previously headed the New York branch of the Federal Reserve and in that role played a major role in addressing the 2008 financial crisis .\nBefore becoming Obama 's chief of staff , Lew was director of the Office of Management and Budget , a post he also held in the Clinton administration , serving from 1998 to early 2001 . While running OMB during the Clinton administration , Lew helped negotiate a balanced budget agreement with Congress , something that has eluded Washington ever since .\nOn Wall Street , Lew also was managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and then Citi Alternative Investments . At the start of the Obama administration , he oversaw international economic issues at the State Department .\nA White House official said Lew would bring an `` impressive record of service in both the public and private sectors for over three decades and economic expertise '' to the job .\n`` His deep knowledge of domestic and international economic issues will enable him to take on the challenges facing our economy at home and abroad on day one , '' the official said .\nLew could be seen by some Republicans as a political figure . He clashed repeatedly with the other side of the aisle during the debt-ceiling fight of 2011 .\nLew has often been described as a `` pragmatic liberal '' who understands what it takes to make a deal even as he stands by his ideological views .\n`` He 's a political guy . He did n't get where he is today by being a shrinking violet , '' said Paul Light , a public policy professor at New York University and an acquaintance . `` But he 's really a doer . He 's the kind of guy you want at the table if you want to get something done . ''\nIf confirmed , Lew would assume the post in time for the administration to battle anew with Republicans over three looming fiscal deadlines -- raising the $ 16.4 trillion federal borrowing limit , averting automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs and the expiration of a congressional resolution that has been keeping the government operating . Those events , if unresolved , would have a far greater negative effect on the economy than the `` fiscal cliff '' that Obama and Congress avoided a week ago .\nInternationally , the 57-year-old Lew also will be the administration 's point man on issues related to China 's integration into the global economy and Europe 's sovereign debt and financial struggles . The issues are n't foreign to Lew . While a deputy secretary of state early in the Obama administration , Lew managed the State Department 's international economic policy portfolio .\nOn Thursday , Obama also gave Geithner a send-off at the White House . `` When the history books are written , Tim Geithner 's going to go down as one of our finest secretaries of Treasury , '' he said .",
