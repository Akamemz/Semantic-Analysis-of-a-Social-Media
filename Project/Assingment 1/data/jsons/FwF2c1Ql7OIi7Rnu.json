( AP Photo/ Evan Vucci )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 The U.S. promised \u201c appropriate action \u201d Friday in response to its assessment that an Iranian missile was responsible for downing a Ukrainian jetliner that crashed outside Tehran , as the Iranian government denied playing a role in the killing of all 176 people on board .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo became the highest-level U.S. official to directly pin the blame on Iran , after Canadian , Australian and British leaders announced similar intelligence conclusions Thursday . \u201c We do believe it is likely that that plane was shot down by an Iranian missile , \u201d he said .\nPompeo said an investigation would continue into the incident and that once it was complete he was \u201c confident that we and the world will take appropriate action as a response. \u201d Leaders said the plane appeared to have been unintentionally hit by a surface-to-air missile .\nEarlier Friday , Iran denied Western allegations that one of its own missiles downed the jetliner that crashed early Wednesday outside Tehran , hours after Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two U.S. bases in Iraq to avenge the killing of its top general in an American airstrike last week .\n\u201c What is obvious for us , and what we can say with certainty , is that no missile hit the plane , \u201d Ali Abedzadeh , head of Iran \u2019 s national aviation department , told a press conference .\n\u201c If they are really sure , they should come and show their findings to the world \u201d in accordance with international standards , he added .\nHassan Rezaeifar , the head of the Iranian investigation team , said recovering data from the black box flight recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year . He also said Iran may request help from international experts if it is not able to extract the flight recordings .\nThe ballistic missile attack on the bases in Iraq caused no casualties , raising hopes that the standoff over the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani would end relatively peacefully , though Iran has sent mixed signals over whether its retaliation is complete .\nIf the U.S. or Canada were to present incontrovertible evidence that the plane was shot down by Iran , even if unintentionally , it could have a dramatic impact on public opinion in Iran .\nThe Iranian public had rallied around the leadership after the killing of Soleimani last Friday , with hundreds of thousands joining the general \u2019 s funeral processions in several cities , in an unprecedented display of grief and unity .\nBut sentiments in Iran are still raw over the government \u2019 s crackdown on large-scale protests late last year sparked by an economic crisis exacerbated by U.S. sanctions . Several hundred protesters were reported to have been killed in the clampdown .\nThose fissures could quickly break open again if Iranian authorities are seen to be responsible for the deaths of 176 people , mainly Iranians or dual Iranian-Canadian citizens . Iran still points to the accidental downing of an Iranian passenger jet by U.S. forces in 1988 \u2014 which killed all 290 people aboard \u2014 as proof of American hostility .\nU.S. , Canadian and British officials said Thursday it is \u201c highly likely \u201d that Iran shot down the Boeing 737 , which crashed near Tehran early Wednesday . U.S. officials said the jetliner might have been mistakenly identified as a threat .\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , whose country lost 57 citizens in the downing , said \u201c we have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence . \u201d\n\u201c The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile , \u201d he said .\nThe U.S. officials did not say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile , believed to be fired by Russian Tor system , known to NATO as the SA-15 . But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region , as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence .\nWestern countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classified sources .\nVideos verified by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 appear to show the final seconds of the the ill-fated airliner , which had just taken off from Iran early Wednesday .\nIn one video , a fast-moving light can be seen through the trees as someone films from the ground . The light appears to be the burning plane , which plummets to the earth as a huge fireball illuminates the landscape .\nSomeone off-camera says in Farsi : \u201c The plane has caught fire . ... In the name of God , the compassionate , the merciful . God , please help us . Call the fire department ! \u201d\nUkraine \u2019 s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said \u201c the missile theory is not ruled out , but it has not been confirmed yet . \u201d\nIn a Facebook post , he reiterated his call \u201c on all international partners \u201d \u2014 the U.S. , Britain and Canada in particular \u2014 to share data and evidence relevant to the crash .
