But if someone does , the GOP will be ready .\nOn a marathon Sunday that saw him appear on five television news shows , Mr. Priebus moved diplomatically to steer Mr. Trump away from an independent bid , offering more details on the pledges signed by Republican candidates to support the nominee and suggesting that statements to the contrary have \u201c consequences . \u201d\n\u201c Those kinds of comments , I think , have consequences , \u201d said Mr. Priebus on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week. \u201d \u201c And so when you make those kinds of comments and you want people to fall in line for you , it makes it more difficult . \u201d\nMr. Priebus said the pledges signed by primary candidates was not \u201c some sort of magical paper , \u201d but an agreement . In exchange for their pledge , he said , candidates received RNC voter data and other resources worth as much as $ 100 million .\nWould he enforce the agreement with a lawsuit , asked host Chris Wallace on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to get into every detail of the agreement . But it \u2019 s a data exchange agreement with the RNC and among the things that they can use at the RNC , \u201d Mr. Priebus said .\n\u201c One of the things that we say is , \u2018 Look , we \u2019 ll give you these things . But you have to agree that you \u2019 re going to support the party and the eventual nominee. \u2019 They \u2019 ve all agreed to that . And we \u2019 ll see what happens , \u201d Mr. Priebus said .\nMoments earlier , the billionaire businessman once again refused to rule out the possibility of an independent run if he loses the Republican nomination .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to have to see how I was treated . Very simple , \u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201c Fox News Sunday. \u201d \u201c I just want to be treated \u2014 it \u2019 s not a question of win or lose . It \u2019 s a question of treatment . I want to be treated fair . \u201d\nAt the same time , both Mr. Priebus and Mr. Trump made it clear that they don \u2019 t expect a third-party scenario to unfold . Mr. Priebus dismissed it as \u201c just a bunch of talk at this point \u201d by candidates who may be \u201c posturing \u201d in order to gain \u201c leverage . \u201d\n\u201c No one has broken the pledge , \u201d Mr. Priebus said , adding , \u201c But certainly , we expect that when candidates make commitments , that they keep them . And that \u2019 s about what I \u2019 m going to say about it . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Mr. Trump said that he fully expects to win the Republican nomination . He currently leads the three-candidate field in delegates entering Tuesday \u2019 s Wisconsin \u201c winner take most \u201d primary .\n\u201c Look , I \u2019 m by far the front-runner as a Republican , \u201d said Mr. Trump . \u201c I want to run as a Republican . I will beat Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nEven with his 736 delegates , however , there remains a path for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to capture the nomination . Polls show Mr. Cruz leading in Wisconsin and gaining momentum in other states as conservatives intensify their anti-Trump push .\nMr. Priebus acknowledged that Republicans are increasingly eyeing the scenario of an open or brokered convention if no candidate amasses the necessary 1,237 delegates before the July 18 gathering at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , Ohio .\n\u201c We will know where everyone stands on delegates on June 8 after the June 7 primaries , \u201d said Mr. Priebus . \u201c There will be no mystery over who has the majority , or if someone doesn \u2019 t whether it \u2019 s going to be an open convention . \u201d\nHe rebutted suggestions that the party may \u201c steal \u201d the nomination , saying the process would be \u201c clear , open and transparent. \u201d Trump ally Roger Stone said Friday that \u201c Trump nation \u201d would organize \u201c days of rage \u201d at the convention if the party tries anything fishy .\n\u201c Nothing can get stolen from anyone , \u201d Mr. Priebus said . \u201c We have rules in place that if a candidate gets to 1,237 delegates , those delegates are bound and they will vote that way on the floor . And if they don \u2019 t vote that way on the floor , which they will , but if they don \u2019 t , the secretary will read the vote as if they were bound regardless . \u201d\nGOP strategist Karl Rove has promoted the idea of a \u201c white knight \u201d nominee , in which a Republican from outside the primary field such as House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin would be nominated at the convention , but Mr. Priebus discounted the possibility .\n\u201c If anything like that were to happen , which I think is highly , highly unlikely , I think our candidate is someone who \u2019 s running , okay ? \u201d Mr. Priebus said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nBut Ohio Gov .
