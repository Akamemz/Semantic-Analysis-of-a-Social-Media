He reckons that the economy can grow faster \u2013 up to 4 percent a year \u2013 and put millions more Americans back to work , primarily by adopting a Reagan-style formula of sweeping tax cuts and lighter regulations .\nIt is an ambitious goal . The economy has averaged only 2.1 percent annual growth since 2009 , and the central challenge , economists say , is not policy so much as the fact that more mature economies grow more slowly .\nYet even if Trump were to fuel a faster expansion than President Obama , there are questions about what that would feel like for American households .\nBy Mr. Trump \u2019 s reckoning , a thriving economy lifts all workers \u2013 and that has been true in the past , most recently during the 1990s . But many economists counter that the Reagan-era economic mantra Trump is adopting has been a primary driver of income inequality \u2013 putting more money in the pockets of the rich and upper-middle class and keeping a lid on middle-income earnings .\nToday \u2019 s economy shows the continuing effects of those Reagan-era shifts , and other global trends such as automation and outsourcing , these economists add . Some households are moving up the income ladder , but since 2000 more are sliding down . And the likelihood that today \u2019 s youth will earn more than their parents \u2013 a staple of the American dream \u2013 appears to be declining .\n\u201c Because of structural changes in this economy , both from globalization and technological change , if you get 4 percent [ economic ] growth today , then the benefits of that growth would not be shared as equally as in past decades . That \u2019 s the core point you want to begin with , \u201d says James Pethokoukis , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank in Washington .\nFrom the start of his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump has appealed to the working class through bold promises on job creation and by touting potential gains from renegotiating trade pacts . Since the election , his transition team has emphasized tax cuts , regulatory reforms , and changes to energy policy to stimulate the economy and accelerate the pace of job creation .\nThere has been less emphasis on tackling the disparities that have funneled the greatest gains to the top because Trump \u2019 s team believes that the best answer to wage stagnation is a roaring economy .\n\u201c Faster growth in itself will achieve the growth in incomes in the lower income groups that need it , \u201d says Diana Furchtgott-Roth , a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a member of Trump \u2019 s transition team .\nThat scenario played out in the late 1990s , when a sustained boom under President Clinton translated into higher wages and longer hours and more overtime for nearly all workers . It was also a period when wage gains were seen year by year , across the board , from bank tellers to truck drivers , before a tech-stock crash led to a recession in 2001 .\nFor conservatives , it \u2019 s a potent message : economic growth can help the needy in ways that big government can \u2019 t . \u201c The difference between poverty and non-poverty in America is work , and having people at work , \u201d says Douglas Holtz-Eakin , a former director of the Congressional Budget Office under President George W Bush .\nYet the Clinton-era boom was the exception , not the rule , says Lane Kenworthy , a political scientist at the University of Arizona who studies economic inequality . \u201c It was the only period [ since the late 1970s ] that we saw sustained wage increases up and down the distribution ladder , \u201d he says .\nBy contrast , a smaller share of the economic gains of the mid-to-late 1980s , when annual growth averaged 4.6 percent , went to middle-class households .\nThe 2000s , meanwhile , offer a mixed picture .
