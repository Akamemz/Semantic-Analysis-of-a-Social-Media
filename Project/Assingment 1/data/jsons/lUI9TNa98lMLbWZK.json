    "content": "It might seem like an odd time for immigrants to sign up to formally become Americans \u2014 after all , Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign rhetoric showed more antipathy to immigrants ( especially Mexicans and Muslims ) than any presidential campaign in decades , and his electoral victory indicated that a great many Americans agreed with him .\nBut as the five new citizens getting naturalized at Thomas Jefferson \u2019 s home in Monticello this July Fourth , whom I spoke to in the days leading up to the ceremony , emphasized , citizenship is also a personal journey .\n\u201c When we came here in 2009 , I was thinking , when I have to become a US citizen , when I have to become part of this great nation , \u201d says Laique Khan , who emigrated from Pakistan . \u201c That \u2019 s what I was thinking when they said , \u2018 Mr . Khan , you have passed , and I would like to say that you are now becoming a US citizen in the coming month. \u2019 And I was really delighted , I was so happy . \u201d\nThe fact of it happening on the Fourth of July was just the cherry on top . Khan teased his wife ( who was naturalized earlier in a small ceremony ) about getting to become a citizen on Independence Day ; \u201c I sometimes said , \u2018 You seem to be jealous of me , \u2019 \u201d he jokes .\nIt \u2019 s a choice that isn \u2019 t made in a moment , but over years or decades of living in the United States \u2014 deciding at the outset to become an American , or realizing it gradually over time . It \u2019 s a process that represents a long wait and a lot of sacrifices . And it \u2019 s an opportunity to have one \u2019 s voice heard going forward .\nOn the eve of their naturalization , no one in America was more patriotic than the Americans-to-be .\n\u201c I knew that I would always make this my permanent home \u201d\nMost of the citizens-to-be I spoke to had come to the US as very young children \u2014 they \u2019 re part of a group that scholars call the \u201c 1.5 generation , \u201d because they \u2019 re technically first-generation immigrants who came to the US themselves but have lived lives more similar to those of immigrants \u2019 US-born children .\nTheir parents had come to the US to make more money than they were making in their home countries , or to pursue an educational opportunity or help with a growing family business . But once they got here , they put down roots .\n\u201c When we moved to America , my parents thought that we were going to go back , \u201d said Tina Chai , whose family initially came here from China so her father could take a medical research fellowship . But they were impressed by the quality of the education Chai was getting at school , and how \u201c elastic \u201d the curriculum was : Instead of having to study either science or the humanities , Chai could study both in interdisciplinary ways . It paid off : At UVA , she \u2019 s preparing for a career in medicine ( though \u201c who knows where life will take me , \u201d she says with a laugh ) by studying biochemistry as well as English , \u201c because I like to say that English really feeds the soul . \u201d\nEconomic opportunity could mean upward mobility \u2014 Juan Becerra \u2019 s parents came from a part of Mexico where there was \u201c nothing much besides working the cornfields \u201d \u2014 but it also meant sacrifice . Victor Zarate \u2019 s father , who had struggled to find work as a civil engineer in Mexico , found employment in the US in the hospitality industry ; he \u2019 s now a banquet manager at a country club .\nIt \u2019 s not easy to migrate to the US as an adult \u2014 more because of the language barrier , the new citizens said , than anything cultural . \u201c Even though we 've been living here for about an equal amount of time , \u201d Chai says of her parents , \u201c they can tell that I 'm definitely more of an American than they are \u2014 in the sense that I just speak very fluent English . \u201d\n\u201c They definitely struggled more with the language barrier and not having that many friends that were American , \u201d Zarate said of his parents . \u201c They didn \u2019 t feel part of the community as much as my sister and I did. \u201d But he stresses that the whole family \u201c just put ourselves out there , \u201d making friends with Americans and \u201c trying to do a lot of what Americans were doing , \u201d and that it ultimately paid off .\n\u201c When I came , \u201d says Khan , the only new citizen I spoke to who immigrated as an adult , \u201c everybody said that it lasts one , two , three years each \u201d to adjust \u2014 to get comfortable enough , personally and professionally , to find a career in the States . \u201c You have to start real hard , \u201d he admits , but \u201c after three and four years , each week goes better and better and better \u2014 and that 's life . \u201d\nThe younger generation appreciates these sacrifices intellectually \u2014 but knows that they don \u2019 t , fundamentally , see the US the same way their parents do .\n\u201c My dad talks about how hard it is to get here and how hard it is to be successful here , \u201d says Athina Patac , who came to the US from the Philippines when she was young . \u201c But I just do n't understand because I did n't grow up the way that he grew up in a Third World country . \u201d\nMost of the other new citizens I talked to haven \u2019 t been back to their home countries much either . Zarate is returning to his hometown of San Miguel de Allende , which he describes as \u201c one of the biggest tourist destinations in Mexico , \u201d for a brief internship after he becomes a citizen , and is looking forward to riding around on horseback and seeing the local museums \u2014 \u201c doing things with my family , things I never got to do growing up . \u201d\nThey \u2019 ve never really had the chance to think of themselves as anything but American .\n\u201c Being young , I didn \u2019 t really understand what it meant to be Mexican or American . I just knew that my home was in Mexico , \u201d Zarate said . \u201c But after a couple of years living in the US , I liked it here ; all my friends are here right now . I knew that I would always make this my permanent home . \u201d\n\u201c I think I was too young to really identify myself with any country at the time when I came , \u201d says Chai . \u201c But then I turned , I would say , maybe 13 or 14 , and that 's when I kind of saw myself as American \u2014 in the sense that , you know , this is where I 've been growing up for so long , this is where my friends are , where my parents are , where my heart is . \u201d\n\u201c Always . I 've always considered myself an American , \u201d says Patac . \u201c I 've always considered myself , I guess , the same as everybody else . I did n't even put a title on my nationality , like whether or not I was a citizen of the Philippines or a citizen of the United States. \u201d Only when her Filipino passport expired when she was in college did she even think seriously about her citizenship \u2014 \u201c and then it was just like , oh , my gosh , so I need to get my life in order right now . \u201d\nThe road to citizenship hasn \u2019 t been bumpy \u2014 but it \u2019 s been long\nWhen you \u2019 ve grown up American in your heart , becoming one on paper might seem like an inevitability . \u201c I didn \u2019 t really decide anything , \u201d says Chai ; \u201c it just sort of fluidly occurred . \u201d\nBut the process isn \u2019 t automatic . For Becerra , it ultimately took some help from a Brazilian woman who was running naturalization classes \u2014 and a lot of studying because , as a landscaping business owner , he \u2019 d forgotten some of the things he needed for the civics test . \u201c It 's not like we 're studying about historical stuff , you know , we 're out there doing lawn care . \u201d\nEveryone I talked to was relieved and elated when they officially found out they were going to be naturalized \u2014 and realized , finally , just how long they \u2019 d been waiting for this moment .\nVictor Zarate \u2019 s father told him the good news . \u201c He called me and was like , \u2018 Have you looked ? \u2019 and I was like , \u2018 No \u2019 and he was like , \u2018 Well , you got it , \u2019 \u201d Zarate says . \u201c It was just a great feeling . \u201d\nAthina Patac \u2019 s husband saw the envelope in the mail ; \u201c he Snapchatted me immediately . He 's like , \u2018 Look what I got ! \u2019 And I was like , aaaaah ! Because we had been waiting for it for so long . \u201d\nAnd for people who \u2019 ve lived near Monticello for years , being naturalized there is doubly significant . Zarate \u2019 s family was rooting for his naturalization ceremony to be located there ( which naturalization ceremony you \u2019 re part of is determined by the region where you live ) ; Tina Chai says it has extra significance for her because \u201c now I go to the University of Virginia , which , you know , is Jefferson \u2019 s university . \u201d\n\u201c I 'm a part of history now , \u201d says Patac . \u201c Like I can tell my daughter that ... you know , like , this is how your mother , your grandmother became a citizen here on Independence Day , the national holiday of America . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not about Trump \u2014 but it is about the need to have a voice\nOf course , as timeless as it is to get naturalized on the Fourth of July , they \u2019 re also getting naturalized in 2017 \u2014 under a president whose attitude toward immigrants has been chilly at best . Donald Trump has targeted Muslim immigrants like Khan ; Mexican immigrants like Becerra and Zarate ; even \u201c the Chinese , \u201d like Chai .\nFor some immigrants , life under Trump has been alienating ; for others , it \u2019 s inspired them to get citizenship . But for the immigrants getting naturalized at Monticello whom I spoke to , getting citizenship isn \u2019 t about Trump \u2014 it \u2019 s about a personal journey .\nNone of the immigrants I spoke to have experienced personal discrimination , or prejudice , in the US .\n\u201c It bothers you when you \u2019 re little , \u201d says Juan Becerra , but \u201c at the end of the day , I live a normal life and pay my taxes , pay for my home , and they 're not paying my bills , so I ai n't worried about them. \u201d ( Becerra dismisses Trump \u2019 s rhetoric about Mexicans ; the president is just talking about unauthorized immigrants and criminals , he says , and \u201c I 've never been in trouble with everything . I try to live a good life , uh , the right way . \u201d )\nAs for politics , Khan just doesn \u2019 t bring it up with anyone . \u201c Where I work , everybody respects me . I respect my bosses . They are so nice , so good , and I do n't want to talk any politics to them . \u201d\nVictor Zarate admits that the \u201c political climate \u201d of 2017 isn \u2019 t exactly what he imagined he \u2019 d be welcomed into when he formally became an American . \u201c The political climate obviously hasn \u2019 t been all that friendly toward immigrants and Mexicans . The things you hear on the news aren \u2019 t , like , too awesome or fun to hear . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s been alienating for his parents , he says \u2014 \u201c with some of the rhetoric going around , I definitely don \u2019 t think they feel they are American or want to be \u201d \u2014 but ultimately , he rejects it as \u201c just a short phase . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s not really what Americans are about . It \u2019 s not really going to change what America is at all , I don \u2019 t think , \u201d he says . \u201c I \u2019 m still proud , I \u2019 m still excited to become an American . \u201d\nIn fact , Zarate says , he \u2019 s going to use his citizenship to speak up on behalf of his parents and others like them . \u201c Because I \u2019 m American I can , first of all actually be a part of the political process , I can vote , just have my voice heard more . I \u2019 m definitely going to speak up and help support immigration or immigrants that are here . That \u2019 s my story , and I had people that helped me growing up , so I want to try and help others who don \u2019 t feel like they have a voice . \u201d\nWhile other new citizens weren \u2019 t so explicit about what they plan to advocate for , all of them shared that sentiment : that being American meant not just that they could vote , but that they could speak up in their community and have it matter .\n\u201c Looking into leadership for the country and leadership for my daughter 's future , that really pushed me \u201d to naturalize , says Athina Patac . \u201c I want to be able to have a voice in any type of benefit for my future as well as any of my children 's future \u2014 I only have a daughter right now , but any of my future kids as well . But if I do n't have my citizenship , I would n't be able to vote , [ so ] even if I stood against any type of initiative strongly , there 's nothing I could do . \u201d\n\u201c I want to be a part of voting , and I want to be part of , you know , the state , \u201d says Juan Becerra . \u201c It would feel good to be able to have a say in voting . People say that one vote does n't matter , but you never know , you know ? \u201d",
