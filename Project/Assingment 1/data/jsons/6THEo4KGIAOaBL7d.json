In the speech she compared herself to Hadiya Pendleton who was shot just a week after performing at the inauguration . Mrs. Obama said , \u201c Hadiya Pendleton was me , and I was her \u201d .\n`` Thousands of children in this city live in neighborhoods where a funeral for a teenager is considered unfortunate , but not unusual ; where wandering onto the wrong block or even just standing on your own front porch can mean putting yourself at risk , '' Michelle Obama told the Chicago crowd , according to a transcript provided by the White House . `` Those are the odds that so many young people are facing in this city \u2013- young people like Hadiya Pendleton , whose funeral I attended back in February . And we all know Hadiya \u2019 s story . She was 15 years old , an honor student at King College Prep . And she came from a good family -\u2013 two devoted parents , plenty of cousins , solid godparents and grandparents , an adoring little brother . The Pendletons are hardworking people . They \u2019 re churchgoing folks . And Hadiya \u2019 s mother did everything she could for her daughter . She enrolled her in every activity you could imagine -\u2013 cheerleading , majorettes , the praise dance ministry -\u2013 anything to keep her off the streets and keep her busy . `` And as I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya \u2019 s funeral , I couldn \u2019 t get over how familiar they felt to me . Because what I realized was Hadiya \u2019 s family was just like my family . Hadiya Pendleton was me , and I was her . But I got to grow up , and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School , and have a career and a family and the most blessed life I could ever imagine . `` And Hadiya ? Oh , we know that story . Just a week after she performed at my husband \u2019 s inauguration , she went to a park with some friends and got shot in the back because some kid thought she was in a gang . Hadiya \u2019 s family did everything right , but she still didn \u2019 t have a chance .

How is it that you can feel comfortable standing on that stage , preaching those words , when you and your husband have done nothing but hurt that city .
