Bill Cassidy got cheers on late-night television for calling for an Obamacare replacement plan that would pass what he calls `` the Jimmy Kimmel test '' \u2014 that is , cover children like the comedian 's son recently born with a congenital heart defect .\nBut the first-term senator and physician is not seeing that support from his GOP colleagues .\n\u201c He knows of what he speaks , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the Senate \u2019 s No . 2 Republican . \u201c But we \u2019 ve got to find a way to get behind a consensus bill . \u201d\nCassidy is undeterred . To hear him tell it , he \u2019 s the one in Congress fighting to keep President Donald Trump \u2019 s promises to his base . On the campaign trail , Cassidy argues that Trump consistently promised a health care plan that would reduce premiums , eliminate mandates , ensure continuous coverage and protect people with pre-existing conditions . Any GOP plan , he says , needs to meet that bar .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been pretty out front and pretty bold and pretty national and pretty local , saying I want our bill to pass because our bill fulfills President Trump \u2019 s pledge to the voter , \u201d Cassidy told 220 people packed into a town hall outside New Orleans last week . \u201c Also , by the way , I think it is good public policy , and I think is good for the American people . \u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) called Cassidy a \u201c real intellectual driver on our side \u201d and said it \u2019 s unlikely the Louisiana senator would simply fall in line at the end of the process and vote for whatever GOP leaders demand . Graham has co-sponsored Cassidy \u2019 s bill even though it stands little chance at this juncture .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight , every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox .

A gastroenterologist who cared for uninsured Louisianans in the state \u2019 s charity hospital system , Cassidy stands out for his passionate advocacy for the people he once treated , even as he ran against Obamacare during his Senate campaign .\nHe was the first senator out of the gate to introduce an Obamacare replacement bill , with moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , that would allow states to set up the health plan of their choice \u2014 including keeping Obamacare . To date , only five Republicans have signed onto a proposal that most other Republicans regard as too liberal and Democrats as too conservative .\nBut should Majority Leader Mitch McConnell be unable to corral 50 votes for a more narrowly partisan bill , Cassidy hopes his bill could become a bipartisan starting point .\n\u201c There are parts of it I like , \u201d Sen. John Kennedy , Cassidy \u2019 s GOP colleague from Louisiana , said of his proposal . \u201c I don \u2019 t like the idea of allowing states to remain on Obamacare if Obamacare is failing . \u201d\nSen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) derided the Cassidy-Collins effort as \u201c window dressing \u201d for what will ultimately be an all-Republican bill written by a 13-person working group that excludes Cassidy .\nCassidy says he wasn \u2019 t offended by his exclusion from McConnell \u2019 s working group \u2014 and he \u2019 s attending the meetings anyway . As someone who probably has more firsthand experience with Medicaid than any other Republican senator , he says he is determined to influence the debate , even if he has to muscle his way in .\nCertainly , he \u2019 s doing everything he can to keep his own proposals in the public eye . When Kimmel \u2019 s tearful plea for health coverage for children went viral last month , Cassidy called for any Obamacare repeal plan to pass the \u201c Jimmy Kimmel test \u201d \u2014 a quip that got him booked on the talk show and that he \u2019 s regularly taken to the Senate floor .\nFormerly a low-profile and somewhat anonymous senator , Cassidy is now dogged by packs of reporters and offers candid takes on the CBO \u2019 s score for the House \u2019 s health care bill ( an \u201c eye-popper , \u201d he says ) . At one point , he rolled up his shirtsleeves and walked reporters through the intricacies of his health care plan on a whiteboard .\nHe also handed his fellow Republicans a seven-page handout showing the strong correlation between the states Trump won and the parts of the country most in need of health care and health insurance . He created a spreadsheet of how much money each state would lose if Obamacare \u2019 s Medicaid expansion funding were eliminated .\nAnd he \u2019 s pushing Republicans to revamp the Medicaid program , now an entitlement , to a set payment for every enrollee \u2014 an idea he first proposed in 2013 .\nHe 's also seeking to automatically enroll people in a health plan with a chance to opt out \u2014 a proposal some other Republicans say is too similar to the unpopular individual mandate .\nCassidy is not alone in advocating for a health care bill that would require Democratic cooperation , and several Republican senators have stated they are uncomfortable with using the budget reconciliation process to sweep away Obamacare on a party-line vote in an effort to avoid a Democratic filibuster . But Republicans say that they can not pursue work with Democrats until their GOP-only efforts fail first .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like that we \u2019 re doing this through reconciliation , \u201d said Collins . \u201c I understand why we are because we \u2019 ve had no cooperation from the other side of the aisle , but I just think that makes it extremely difficult to come up with a comprehensive approach . \u201d\nSen. Mike Rounds ( R-S.D . ) , a supporter of the Cassidy-Collins bill , said Democrats won \u2019 t cooperate unless the GOP \u2019 s party-line effort fails . But he said he was confident that Cassidy \u2019 s legislation would get consideration and that he has the most realistic view of how to move away from Obamacare : by propping up the individual markets with subsidies to keep insurance affordable for several years .\n\u201c He understands that you can \u2019 t just simply look at them and say \u2026 \u2018 We \u2019 re just going to let you fend for yourself , \u2019 \u201d Rounds said of Cassidy . \u201c I call it the Obamacare hangover .
