    "content": "Mr. Giuliani has \u201c obviously evolved , and in some ways not for the better , \u201d says Andrew Kirtzman , author of \u201c Rudy Giuliani : Emperor of the City. \u201d \u201c Once he cast his lot with Trump , he went all the way , which is how Rudy Giuliani does things . \u201d\nFor some who remember the old Mr. Giuliani , the New York mayor who personified bipartisan leadership after Sept. 11 , 2001 \u2013 earning him an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 it \u2019 s been a stark transformation . In some ways , it mirrors that of American politics writ large , as the post-9/11 high point of unity and resolve dissipated into increasingly bitter partisanship during the Bush and Obama presidencies and the tabloid ugliness of the Trump era .\nLately , Mr. Giuliani has come under increasing scrutiny for his involvement in what effectively became a shadow foreign policy . His efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in an alleged quid pro quo for military aid sit at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into the president .\nOver the long arc of his career , Rudy Giuliani has gone from Democrat to moderate Republican to Trump Republican ; from mob-busting federal prosecutor to celebrity mayor to controversial personal lawyer for President Donald Trump .\nPeter King didn \u2019 t have much use for Rudy Giuliani when they first met in the summer of 1967 .\nBoth were 23-year-old interns at the Wall Street law firm of future President Richard Nixon . Another partner at the firm , future Attorney General John Mitchell , assigned them to work together on a municipal bonds project .\nThe two law students , though both graduates of Roman Catholic high schools in Brooklyn , didn \u2019 t see eye to eye on much . Mr. Giuliani was \u201c pretty liberal \u201d \u2013 a Bobby Kennedy supporter \u2013 says Mr. King , who was and is a Republican , currently in his 14th term in Congress . Mr. Giuliani rooted for the Yankees , Mr. King for the Mets .\nThey also had contrasting styles . \u201c He thought I was very caustic or opinionated when I was writing ; he was being more judicious , \u201d Congressman King tells the Monitor . \u201c Rudy \u2019 s very smart . He was much more into the law than I was . \u201d\nDecades later , the 9/11 attacks brought the two New York pols together , and they have been friends ever since . But over time , one has gone through a profound evolution . After those early days as a Democrat , Mr. Giuliani went from political independent to moderate Republican \u2013 so moderate he endorsed Democrat Mario Cuomo for governor in 1994 \u2013 to Trump Republican , and from mob-busting federal prosecutor to celebrity mayor to controversial personal lawyer for President Donald Trump . Still , longtime friends see \u201c the same old Rudy , \u201d a bit grayer but with the same no-holds-barred approach to life .\n\u201c Certainly everything he \u2019 s done from the time he became U.S. attorney has been either Page One or Page Six , \u201d says Mr. King , referring to the New York Post \u2019 s gossip page . Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s third divorce , from wife Judith , has provided recent fodder .\nMr. King retains a strong bond with Mr. Giuliani \u2013 but the same can not be said for some of the ex-mayor \u2019 s former aides , several of whom have been publicly critical of Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s work for Mr. Trump in what effectively became a shadow foreign policy . Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in an alleged quid pro quo for military aid sit at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into the president .\nCarolyn Kaste/AP/File Then-President-elect Donald Trump ( right ) and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani pose for photographs outside the clubhouse at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster , New Jersey , Nov. 20 , 2016 .\n\u201c \u2018 America \u2019 s Mayor , \u2019 as Rudy was called after Sept. 11 , is today President Trump \u2019 s bumbling personal lawyer and henchman , his apologist and defender of the indefensible , \u201d wrote Ken Frydman , Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s 1993 campaign press secretary , in a New York Times op-ed .\nMr. Giuliani \u201c lost his way \u201d after he became a lobbyist and insider , former political adviser Rick Wilson recently told Politico .\nTop aides to Mr. Trump have also expressed reservations about the president \u2019 s lawyer . \u201c Giuliani \u2019 s a hand grenade who \u2019 s going to blow everybody up , \u201d former national security adviser John Bolton was recently quoted as saying .\nIn the latest blow to Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s credibility , the same U.S. attorney \u2019 s office in Manhattan that he once ran is now investigating him over his ties to two Soviet-born men arrested on campaign finance charges . The Justice Department , where he was once the No . 3 official , put out an unusual statement distancing itself from Mr. Giuliani . The former mayor has rebuffed congressional demands for documents .\nWhile speaking to reporters Friday from the White House south lawn , Mr. Trump defended his friend . \u201c He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York , and he \u2019 s been one of the greatest crime-fighters and corruption fighters , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Rudy Giuliani is a good man . \u201d\nFor some who remember the old Mr. Giuliani , the mayor who personified leadership on and immediately after Sept. 11 , 2001 \u2013 earning him an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 it \u2019 s been a stark transformation .\nAfter the 9/11 attacks , Mr. Giuliani seemed to be everywhere \u2013 comforting grieving families , standing in on at least one occasion for the slain father of the bride at a wedding .\n\u201c He showed a humanness that he hadn \u2019 t exhibited in the past , \u201d says Doug Muzzio , a political scientist at Baruch College in New York City .\nIn a way , the transformation of Mr. Giuliani from that post-9/11 period to today mirrors that of American politics writ large . The nation has gone from a high point of unity and resolve to increasingly bitter partisanship during the Bush and Obama presidencies to the tabloid ugliness of the Trump era .\nMr. Giuliani has \u201c obviously evolved , and in some ways not for the better , \u201d says Andrew Kirtzman , who covered the mayor as a local TV reporter and wrote a biography , \u201c Rudy Giuliani : Emperor of the City . \u201d\n\u201c Giuliani was always a bombastic public figure , but as mayor , he used that bombast for tactical reasons , \u201d Mr. Kirtzman says . His example : Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s \u201c terrorizing \u201d of the public schools chancellor until he resigned , so the mayor could take control of the school system .\nMr. Giuliani \u2019 s Achilles \u2019 heel was race relations , but he is widely credited with cleaning up Times Square , bringing down crime , and fighting corruption .\n\u201c He was hardly an unguided missile , \u201d Mr. Kirtzman says . \u201c He was a very , very , very smart strategist , with a very tempestuous way of getting things done . I don \u2019 t see that this time around . I see less discipline in how he \u2019 s proceeding . \u201d\nGetting at the \u201c why \u201d behind Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s transformation is tricky , but there are theories . Some observers point to Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s failed 2008 presidential campaign as a pivotal event . He wasn \u2019 t one to go off and write books . He wanted to stay in the game .\nAdvocating for Mr. Trump , it seems , was his ticket back to political relevance . And he plunged into it with gusto , if at times in embarrassing fashion . In one of his more memorable recent TV appearances , with CNN \u2019 s Chris Cuomo , Mr. Giuliani at first denied that he had asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens , then 30 seconds later stated he had . The past two weeks , he has been notably absent from TV .\nThe similarities between Messrs. Trump and Giuliani are obvious : both native New Yorkers , limelight seekers , increasingly conservative over time , thrice married . But they weren \u2019 t always allies or even friendly . In 1986 , when Mr. Giuliani was a prosecutor and Mr. Trump was coming up in real estate , the two were on opposing sides of a corruption trial involving a Trump-connected public official .\nThey didn \u2019 t become confidants until Mr. Trump began his march to the presidency , Giuliani observers say .\nStill , the two had traveled in the same circles for years . They attended each other \u2019 s third weddings . Mr. Trump donated to Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s aborted Senate campaign in 1999 . The mayor spoke at the funeral of Mr. Trump \u2019 s father .\nPerhaps their most memorable interaction \u2013 especially now , in hindsight \u2013 came in a video produced for a charity dinner in 2000 . Mr. Giuliani is in drag , and Mr. Trump is himself , behaving in an aggressively flirtatious way .\n\u201c Oh , you dirty boy , you ! \u201d scolds Mr. Giuliani as \u201c Rudia , \u201d before slapping Mr. Trump .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t say I didn \u2019 t try , \u201d the future president shrugs .\nYears later , a month before the 2016 election , Mr. Giuliani would emerge as the GOP nominee \u2019 s most aggressive defender after an old \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d video leaked of Mr. Trump bragging in vulgar terms about sexually assaulting women .\nMr. Giuliani has been defending him ever since , and in April 2018 was named to Mr. Trump \u2019 s personal legal team \u2013 unpaid , it turns out . Not that Mr. Giuliani isn \u2019 t interested in money . When his time as mayor ended , soon after 9/11 , he went into business , marketing his services as a management and security consultant and commanding high speaking fees .\nPublic documents from his latest , ongoing divorce show the former mayor is worth many millions of dollars , with assets that include six homes .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the funny thing about these New York folks , \u201d says Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College poll in Poughkeepsie , New York . \u201c If you take Hillary [ Clinton ] , Giuliani , Trump \u2013 what \u2019 s prominent for all of them was the idea that there was money to be made . \u201d\nMr. Giuliani , who comes from working-class roots , didn \u2019 t always pursue the high life . As a prosecutor , \u201c there was something very spartan about him , \u201d says Mr. Kirtzman , the biographer . \u201c He was never seen out at parties or nightclubs . In many ways , he was a scold back then . \u201d\nMr. King , the congressman , also remembers Mr. Giuliani during their summer law internship as not all that gregarious . Now , when Mr. King \u2019 s family is in Washington , they head over to the Trump hotel for drinks , and there \u2019 s Mr. Giuliani . On one occasion , \u201c he comes over , and he \u2019 s telling my grandson how great I am , \u201d says the congressman .\nMr. King says he isn \u2019 t all that surprised by Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s behavior today . \u201c He \u2019 s playing a different role \u2013 the role of getting attention , and trying to get attention away from the Democrats . \u201d\nThe congressman describes Mr. Giuliani \u2013 until recently , at least \u2013 as more of a TV advocate . \u201c Rudy \u2019 s thing is , always be on offense , \u201d Mr. King says . \u201c He and President Trump are almost identical in that . Never back off , just keep going . No matter what they throw at you , you throw twice as much back . \u201d\nAnd what of the Giuliani-Nixon connection back in 1967 ?
