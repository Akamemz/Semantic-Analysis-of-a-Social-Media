    "content": "Sen. Mitt Romney walks through the subway system at the U.S. Capitol , December 17 , 2019 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nI \u2019 ve never understood Mitt Romney . I \u2019 ve admired him , even warmed to him . The post-election documentary Mitt presents Mitt Romney as a man who is high in conscientiousness ; he chases after the tiniest litter in his presence . It shows a winning self-effacing side of the man ; it shows him admiring his father more than himself . In that film , he takes the slings and arrows of public life with some grace . He \u2019 s been on the right side of various controversies in his Church , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . He was , by everyone \u2019 s accounts , a sterling business partner who worked hard and intelligently building a business in a high-stakes field .\nIn my own reporting on him , I \u2019 ve seen how his high energy and his chase for excellence come out in his family life . I \u2019 ve seen how he taught his sons to make difficult choices in their high-pressure and high-status jobs to prioritize time traditionally set aside for Romney family get-togethers . Just a picture of his children , their spouses , and his grandkids is a visual argument for his greatness as a man . I \u2019 ve long thought that one of his mistakes was not being more open about his faith and more candid . He \u2019 s an example of the way Mormonism seemed to be a frontier mutation of American WASP culture , one that endowed its members with a certain competitive flintiness , political realism , and actual family values where before there was merely graceful entitlement and a certain gin-blossom softness . And I \u2019 ve even admired his ambition for higher office . Having proved himself as a son , a husband , a father , and in business , he sought to serve his country in a very special way , as his father did . And he seemed to conceive of doing so as a way of demonstrating not just his gratitude for his country , but proving the worth of the subculture of it that formed him .\nBut I \u2019 ve never understood him . Once the subject turns to politics , law , and morality , the things Romney says and his actions don \u2019 t quite match , or his reasoning doesn \u2019 t cohere . Unable to understand him , I \u2019 ve found him impossible to believe . And on two subjects in particular it has been impossible to reconcile his words and actions : abortion and Donald Trump . Exploring the first can help us illuminate his approach to the latter .\nIn 1994 , seeking to defeat Ted Kennedy , Romney argued vigorously , but implausibly , that he was as much or more pro-choice than Ted Kennedy . He and his wife went to a Planned Parenthood fundraiser and donated $ 150 to the organization , though later he claimed not to recall this . Sometimes Romney would hint that he had \u201c personal beliefs \u201d about the issue that weren \u2019 t relevant to the public . He then ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 as pro-choice and won , while vowing not to change the state \u2019 s abortion laws . He supported taxpayer-funded abortions for disadvantaged women , though he did end up signing some legislation supported by pro-lifers .\nThere have been multiple attempts to explain this . As he began to have presidential-sized ambitions in the Republican Party , Romney confessed that his initial position was a lie . He said , \u201c The greatest mistake was when I first ran for office , being deeply opposed to abortion but saying , \u2018 I support the current law , \u2019 which was pro-choice and effectively a pro-choice position . That was just wrong . \u201d\nA friendly election-year biography attributed his position to mere political expediency . It was the result of polling done by Richard Wirthlin showing that he couldn \u2019 t win statewide office with an effectively pro-life position .\nBut neither of these quite captures what Romney had argued or done . Romney actually took Wirthlin , a fellow Mormon with connections high in the Church \u2019 s hierarchy , to Salt Lake City to explain what his position would be and the necessity of having it to achieve his desired office to LDS leaders . He was looking for neither a blessing nor an endorsement . But , if we are to believe his latter claim about his \u201c greatest mistake , \u201d it seems as if this meeting was an attempt to receive tacit endorsement to lie to the public about his beliefs , or it was to lie to his most senior churchmen .\nDuring the campaign , he said that his mother , Lenore Romney , had been for legal abortion , due to the death of a family member , Ann Keenan , during an illegal abortion in 1963 . \u201c My mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want , \u201d he said , recalling that story , \u201c but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter . And you will not see me wavering on that. \u201d In fact , Lenore Romney \u2019 s position was muddled , a preference for more-liberal abortion rights , but she also publicly affirmed her exasperation with \u201c the argument that a woman should have the final word. \u201d Romney \u2019 s interpretation of his mother \u2019 s position was hotly disputed by veterans of her 1970 campaign for the U.S. Senate . And voters did see him \u201c waver \u201d on the issue , eventually .\nAnd , while he claimed he would not impose his \u201c personal beliefs \u201d on others , as a bishop of his Church , he conscientiously counseled women against abortions that were impermissible by the standards of the LDS Church , which condemns abortion done for \u201c personal convenience \u201d as immoral , and offered counsel supporting the decision to abort in the case of an ectopic pregnancy .\nPerhaps the \u201c personal beliefs \u201d distinction appealed because it served to rhetorically reconcile his political statements with his membership in his Church , but it represents its own kind of incoherence . Political beliefs about the rate of taxation , deficits , or public management of health care are just as much \u201c personal beliefs \u201d as convictions about the unborn . Romney is confessing that as governor he was willing to oversee the imposition of taxes , fines , and prison sentences for violations of relatively trivial personal beliefs translated into public , but questions of whom it might be legitimate to kill would be subject to this unsupportable distinction .\nRomney would tell Katie Couric about his mistake when explaining his 2005 decision to reject a bill that would fund embryonic-stem-cell research : \u201c It became apparent to me when a bill reached my desk that would have created new life and destroyed it , and I simply could not sign it . It was unacceptable to me to . . . be associated with the destruction of human life . And I recognized that. \u201d It was a strange answer , to suggest that when the issue had been framed as a beloved family member \u2019 s death , it was merely an abstraction to him . But that when it involved a complex lab process , it became real . This is not very plausible . And it was made less so when he immediately revealed the continued incoherence of his views by saying that he would allow surplus embryos created by couples through in vitro fertilization to be donated to research and then destroyed if the couple chose .\nEffectively , his position became that he had made a mistake and misrepresented his views to the public of Massachusetts , but having then realized he was wrong and that the destruction of human embryos could not be countenanced , he still privileged his campaign promise to not change the laws of the state over the personhood of the unborn .\nOn Bill O \u2019 Reilly , he tried to describe his thinking . \u201c I thought , \u2018 Well , I can say and can understand the idea of leaving the law the way it is. \u2019 \u201d Slate journalist Will Saletan wisely noted that Romney continued to avoid describing his convictions directly , referring instead to how he negotiated his conscience and public attitudes . \u201c This isn \u2019 t a man talking about what he believes , \u201d Saletan observed . \u201c It \u2019 s a man talking about framing a public posture under constraint. \u201d What Saletan observed is not so much Romney changing his views on abortion as changing his political identity on the issue .\nWhat I would say is that Romney \u2019 s consistent application of Mormon teaching on abortion as a bishop acting in a pastoral role and his various political personas show a man who is convinced that he had to condescend to the voters whose support he was soliciting . He manages it with some half-truths and self-deception but mainly through a lack of candor and logic .\nThis habit of studying voters and trying to learn what they want to hear is why my friend and colleague Jonah Goldberg says that Mitt Romney speaks \u201c conservatism as a second language. \u201d Romney called himself a \u201c severe conservative \u201d : a two-word phrase that communicated whole essays about his desire to pander to conservatives , his inability to understand them , and his low view of their political enterprise \u2014 and how he conceived of the unfortunate moral and aesthetic price of his own ambitions in winning their support . In both pretending to be more pro-choice or pro-life than he was , he was lowering himself to his audience .\nHe is far from the only politician who has shifted his views on Donald Trump , and he may not be the most incoherent . Ted Cruz started his chase for the Republican presidency by proudly declaring that he thought Donald Trump was awesome . But by the end , Cruz perhaps confessed to his own lack of candor when he said with the first genuine emotion I \u2019 ve ever seen from him : \u201c I \u2019 m going to do something I haven \u2019 t done for the entire campaign , for those of you all who \u2019 ve traveled with me , all across the country . I \u2019 m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump . . . . The man is utterly amoral . . . . Morality does not exist for him. \u201d But then again , nobody I know is currently praising Ted Cruz for his moral consistency , courage , and conscience .\nRomney also once claimed to tell us what he really thought of Donald Trump when he made an extraordinary intervention in the 2016 campaign . As the party \u2019 s most recent nominee for president , he gave a blistering speech against the man who was already becoming the presumptive nominee . \u201c Think of Donald Trump \u2019 s personal qualities . The bullying , the greed , the showing off , the misogyny , the absurd third-grade theatrics , \u201d he said .\nHe criticized Trump \u2019 s nastiness and his racism , his willingness to scapegoat Muslims and immigrants . He said Trump didn \u2019 t know anything about the economy and predicted that if Trump embarked on his trade war , it would plunge the American economy into deep recession . \u201c Here \u2019 s what I know . Donald Trump is a phony , a fraud . His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University . He \u2019 s playing the members of the American public for suckers . He gets a free ride to the White House , and all we get is a lousy hat . \u201d\nRomney did not have to wait for the 2016 election to form a low opinion of Donald Trump . In the middle of Romney \u2019 s own 2012 campaign , Donald Trump had become an unwelcome sideshow , fanning the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama wasn \u2019 t born in the United States . Romney dropped everything to fly to Vegas to collect Donald \u2019 s endorsement when it was offered . Romney praised Trump \u2019 s position on China and his understanding of the economy . Again , candidates always accept endorsements where they can help . But accepting it in the way he did was another form of condescension .\nIf Romney really believed that Donald Trump was a phony and a fraud , why did he seriously explore a role as secretary of state in Trump \u2019 s administration ? Some of my friends have argued that interposing oneself between an unfit president and foreign policy violates no moral code . As a moral abstraction , that \u2019 s true . But the job of the secretary of state is not to interpose . That \u2019 s a job more properly for Congress . A Cabinet member \u2019 s job is to advise , appraise , and execute . Interposing is an extremely unconstitutional way of thinking about it . Romney had denounced Trump \u2019 s foreign policy in public and then watched the American people elect him . Had Romney learned anything from this event ? Had he been humbled in any way ? He showed no evidence of it .\nWhile it may not have gone very far , Romney did some diligence on the idea of the job . He contacted all the living secretaries of state . He said he \u201c spoke with Secretary Clinton , and in each case , each of them said : \u2018 Please , please take that job , if it \u2019 s offered to you . We would very much like to see you serve in that capacity . \u2019 \u201d\nNow , there \u2019 s something funny about consulting with Clinton . First , of course , is that she had just been rejected for the job of president . Her advice on who should be secretary of state is irrelevant . But second , in Romney \u2019 s big anti-Trump intervention , Romney let fly with harsh criticisms of Clinton \u2019 s tenure at State . He said \u201c when she was guiding it \u2026 America \u2019 s interests were diminished at every corner of the world . She compromised our national secrets . She dissembled to the families of the slain . And she jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power . \u201d\nThese are extremely grave accusations . If she did all that , why seek her input ? Or was this criticism another attempt at condescending to Republican prejudices while trying to appeal to them ? Am I supposed to believe his brief against Clinton ? I don \u2019 t know . Seriously considering the job at State and taking Clinton \u2019 s advice both seem to betray his public words .\nBut the inconsistency carries through again . Even though in 2016 he said he would have rejected Trump \u2019 s endorsement for president had Trump said what he did about Muslims then , Romney happily accepted Trump \u2019 s endorsement for Senate in 2018 , and then , when he arrived in Washington , returned the favor with a Washington Post op-ed criticizing the president . All these gyrations can be explained in isolation , as attempts at conciliation and provocation come in their turns . But the movement taken as a whole is surprisingly snakelike .\nAnd so I come to his speech explaining his vote to convict and remove President Trump . My own view is that what Trump did was wrong , but much less serious a violation of his duties than many things done under all the presidents of my lifetime . And so I think the proposed remedy of impeachment and removal is excessive , unless we intend to dramatically raise the standards of public conduct . Perhaps we ought to raise them in a way that would disallow vice presidents \u2019 sons from sitting on the boards of state-linked corporations in a country where his father \u2019 s administration had just backed a change of government without an election . Perhaps a top adviser to the Romney campaign shouldn \u2019 t have been on that same board either , given the appearance of corruption it gives to Ukrainians .\nRomney waited for his moment until after all his Senate colleagues had committed to their course of action . Romney framed his decision in the most elevated terms possible . \u201c I swore an oath , before God , to exercise \u2018 impartial justice. \u2019 \u201d He said , \u201c I am a profoundly religious person . I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. \u201d I \u2019 m happy for him to finally acknowledge his faith in this way . Though , I wish as governor of Massachusetts he had fought to allow Catholic adoption agencies to take their oaths before God as seriously as he does .\nRomney talked about his duty as a senator-juror as he unfurled his surprise vote to convict and impeach . He and his office timed three exclusive media pieces in The Atlantic , the New York Times , and Fox News , in which he talked about his decision and his place in history .\nBut wouldn \u2019 t a serious senator-juror from a one-party safe state talk , argue , and remonstrate with the other jurors ? Shouldn \u2019 t the most politically vulnerable members of his caucus and the ones most likely to change their assessment \u2014 Susan Collins and Cory Gardner \u2014 hear about his reasoning and decision before he tells the producers of Chris Wallace \u2019 s television show ? Apparently not .\nIf Romney really believes that Trump is acting akin to a \u201c tinhorn dictator , \u201d as he claimed in his explanations , he would logically be obliged to overcome his policy differences with Trump \u2019 s rival Democratic candidate in 2020 and endorse him or her , or explain why Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Bernie Sanders is worse than a tinhorn dictator . I suspect he won \u2019 t . And when he doesn \u2019 t , he \u2019 ll once again have found a public persona and identity at the cost of candor and coherence .\nAt the risk of alienating any readers who have stuck with me , perhaps this is the downside of all the things I admire about Mitt Romney \u2019 s Mormonism . Romney takes grave and costly moral stands and reverses them with unsatisfying and incoherent explanations . His Church does the same \u2014 on polygamy and on the admissibility of black people to the universal priesthood of his Church . The Church digs in , firing thunderbolts at its critics . And then a political opportunity ( statehood ) or a political cost ( boycotts led by the Reverend Jesse Jackson ) comes into view . No coherent explanation is given for the change ; no rational account of God \u2019 s provident change is offered . A revelation just comes from on high .\nIn one of his rollout interviews , Romney was asked if this vote signaled his ambitions for higher office . According to the report : Romney \u201c erupted in laughter . \u2018 Yes ! That \u2019 s it ! They caught me ! \u2019 he proclaimed . \u2018 Look at the base I have ! It \u2019 s going to be at least 2 or 3 percent of the Republican Party . As goes Utah , so goes the nation ! \u2019 \u201d\nWell , there it is , the great revelation . From his 2012 campaign , we know of Americans , he holds 47 percent in contempt . Now we know that of Republicans , the percentage rises to 97 or 98 . He doesn \u2019 t seek the esteem of the New York Times , which is fickle . And he understands that he will be subject to the sustained and sometimes hysterical criticism of his party . His moral and political beliefs shift constantly , and may yet shift again . And though they do not cohere , I credit his deep sincerity , a sincerity which is in its way uniquely religious .\nMere mortals think their actions define them . And if he were judged by his actions outside of politics , Romney would rank as one of America \u2019 s greatest men . But he always conceived of politics as a low business and so tried to make deals with himself and his audience about what he \u201c could \u201d say , rather than what he should . From more pro-choice than Ted Kennedy , to severely conservative , from Trump \u2019 s greatest scourge to his potential senior diplomat , and back again , from consuming ambition for high office to indifference to it , Romney \u2019 s actions never really meant anything or made a difference . The futility of his impeachment vote was the point , the rebuke of the other 97 percent of Republicans . But taken together , all of Romney \u2019 s political actions bear witness to the one sincere , consistent , and abiding truth : He has always esteemed himself as the real elect .",
    "content_original": "Sen. Mitt Romney walks through the subway system at the U.S. Capitol, December 17, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nHis condescension to the public and esteem of himself.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood Mitt Romney. I\u2019ve admired him, even warmed to him. The post-election documentary Mitt presents Mitt Romney as a man who is high in conscientiousness; he chases after the tiniest litter in his presence. It shows a winning self-effacing side of the man; it shows him admiring his father more than himself. In that film, he takes the slings and arrows of public life with some grace. He\u2019s been on the right side of various controversies in his Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was, by everyone\u2019s accounts, a sterling business partner who worked hard and intelligently building a business in a high-stakes field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my own reporting on him, I\u2019ve seen how his high energy and his chase for excellence come out in his family life.

I\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. . . . The man is utterly amoral. . . . Morality does not exist for him.\u201d But then again, nobody I know is currently praising Ted Cruz for his moral consistency, courage, and conscience.\n\nRomney also once claimed to tell us what he really thought of Donald Trump when he made an extraordinary intervention in the 2016 campaign. As the party\u2019s most recent nominee for president, he gave a blistering speech against the man who was already becoming the presumptive nominee. \u201cThink of Donald Trump\u2019s personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe criticized Trump\u2019s nastiness and his racism, his willingness to scapegoat Muslims and immigrants. He said Trump didn\u2019t know anything about the economy and predicted that if Trump embarked on his trade war, it would plunge the American economy into deep recession. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He\u2019s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\u201d\n\nRomney did not have to wait for the 2016 election to form a low opinion of Donald Trump. In the middle of Romney\u2019s own 2012 campaign, Donald Trump had become an unwelcome sideshow, fanning the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States. Romney dropped everything to fly to Vegas to collect Donald\u2019s endorsement when it was offered. Romney praised Trump\u2019s position on China and his understanding of the economy. Again, candidates always accept endorsements where they can help. But accepting it in the way he did was another form of condescension.\n\nIf Romney really believed that Donald Trump was a phony and a fraud, why did he seriously explore a role as secretary of state in Trump\u2019s administration? Some of my friends have argued that interposing oneself between an unfit president and foreign policy violates no moral code. As a moral abstraction, that\u2019s true. But the job of the secretary of state is not to interpose. That\u2019s a job more properly for Congress. A Cabinet member\u2019s job is to advise, appraise, and execute. Interposing is an extremely unconstitutional way of thinking about it. Romney had denounced Trump\u2019s foreign policy in public and then watched the American people elect him. Had Romney learned anything from this event? Had he been humbled in any way? He showed no evidence of it.\n\nWhile it may not have gone very far, Romney did some diligence on the idea of the job. He contacted all the living secretaries of state. He said he \u201cspoke with Secretary Clinton, and in each case, each of them said: \u2018Please, please take that job, if it\u2019s offered to you. We would very much like to see you serve in that capacity.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s something funny about consulting with Clinton. First, of course, is that she had just been rejected for the job of president. Her advice on who should be secretary of state is irrelevant. But second, in Romney\u2019s big anti-Trump intervention, Romney let fly with harsh criticisms of Clinton\u2019s tenure at State. He said \u201cwhen she was guiding it \u2026 America\u2019s interests were diminished at every corner of the world. She compromised our national secrets. She dissembled to the families of the slain. And she jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power.\u201d\n\nThese are extremely grave accusations. If she did all that, why seek her input? Or was this criticism another attempt at condescending to Republican prejudices while trying to appeal to them? Am I supposed to believe his brief against Clinton? I don\u2019t know. Seriously considering the job at State and taking Clinton\u2019s advice both seem to betray his public words.\n\nBut the inconsistency carries through again. Even though in 2016 he said he would have rejected Trump\u2019s endorsement for president had Trump said what he did about Muslims then, Romney happily accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement for Senate in 2018, and then, when he arrived in Washington, returned the favor with a Washington Post op-ed criticizing the president. All these gyrations can be explained in isolation, as attempts at conciliation and provocation come in their turns. But the movement taken as a whole is surprisingly snakelike.\n\nAnd so I come to his speech explaining his vote to convict and remove President Trump. My own view is that what Trump did was wrong, but much less serious a violation of his duties than many things done under all the presidents of my lifetime. And so I think the proposed remedy of impeachment and removal is excessive, unless we intend to dramatically raise the standards of public conduct. Perhaps we ought to raise them in a way that would disallow vice presidents\u2019 sons from sitting on the boards of state-linked corporations in a country where his father\u2019s administration had just backed a change of government without an election. Perhaps a top adviser to the Romney campaign shouldn\u2019t have been on that same board either, given the appearance of corruption it gives to Ukrainians.\n\nRomney waited for his moment until after all his Senate colleagues had committed to their course of action. Romney framed his decision in the most elevated terms possible. \u201cI swore an oath, before God, to exercise \u2018impartial justice.\u2019\u201d He said, \u201cI am a profoundly religious person. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\u201d I\u2019m happy for him to finally acknowledge his faith in this way. Though, I wish as governor of Massachusetts he had fought to allow Catholic adoption agencies to take their oaths before God as seriously as he does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRomney talked about his duty as a senator-juror as he unfurled his surprise vote to convict and impeach. He and his office timed three exclusive media pieces in The Atlantic, the New York Times, and Fox News, in which he talked about his decision and his place in history.\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t a serious senator-juror from a one-party safe state talk, argue, and remonstrate with the other jurors? Shouldn\u2019t the most politically vulnerable members of his caucus and the ones most likely to change their assessment \u2014 Susan Collins and Cory Gardner \u2014 hear about his reasoning and decision before he tells the producers of Chris Wallace\u2019s television show? Apparently not.\n\nIf Romney really believes that Trump is acting akin to a \u201ctinhorn dictator,\u201d as he claimed in his explanations, he would logically be obliged to overcome his policy differences with Trump\u2019s rival Democratic candidate in 2020 and endorse him or her, or explain why Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Bernie Sanders is worse than a tinhorn dictator. I suspect he won\u2019t. And when he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll once again have found a public persona and identity at the cost of candor and coherence.\n\nAt the risk of alienating any readers who have stuck with me, perhaps this is the downside of all the things I admire about Mitt Romney\u2019s Mormonism. Romney takes grave and costly moral stands and reverses them with unsatisfying and incoherent explanations. His Church does the same \u2014 on polygamy and on the admissibility of black people to the universal priesthood of his Church. The Church digs in, firing thunderbolts at its critics. And then a political opportunity (statehood) or a political cost (boycotts led by the Reverend Jesse Jackson) comes into view. No coherent explanation is given for the change; no rational account of God\u2019s provident change is offered. A revelation just comes from on high.\n\nIn one of his rollout interviews, Romney was asked if this vote signaled his ambitions for higher office. According to the report: Romney \u201cerupted in laughter. \u2018Yes! That\u2019s it! They caught me!\u2019 he proclaimed. \u2018Look at the base I have! It\u2019s going to be at least 2 or 3 percent of the Republican Party. As goes Utah, so goes the nation!\u2019\u201d\n\nWell, there it is, the great revelation. From his 2012 campaign, we know of Americans, he holds 47 percent in contempt. Now we know that of Republicans, the percentage rises to 97 or 98. He doesn\u2019t seek the esteem of the New York Times, which is fickle. And he understands that he will be subject to the sustained and sometimes hysterical criticism of his party. His moral and political beliefs shift constantly, and may yet shift again. And though they do not cohere, I credit his deep sincerity, a sincerity which is in its way uniquely religious.\n\nMere mortals think their actions define them. And if he were judged by his actions outside of politics, Romney would rank as one of America\u2019s greatest men. But he always conceived of politics as a low business and so tried to make deals with himself and his audience about what he \u201ccould\u201d say, rather than what he should. From more pro-choice than Ted Kennedy, to severely conservative, from Trump\u2019s greatest scourge to his potential senior diplomat, and back again, from consuming ambition for high office to indifference to it, Romney\u2019s actions never really meant anything or made a difference. The futility of his impeachment vote was the point, the rebuke of the other 97 percent of Republicans. But taken together, all of Romney\u2019s political actions bear witness to the one sincere, consistent, and abiding truth: He has always esteemed himself as the real elect.",
