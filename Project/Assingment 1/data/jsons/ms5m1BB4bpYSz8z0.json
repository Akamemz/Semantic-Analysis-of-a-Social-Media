Despite conservative threats, the slew of anti-immigration primary challenges \u2014 for the most part \u2014 simply haven\u2019t materialized.

She\u2019s held several immigration events in her 2nd District, including a Feb. 19 roundtable with a slew of pro-reform groups. And she\u2019s even scolded a constituent who disagreed with her on immigration, telling him in an exchange caught on video: \u201cYou don\u2019t have any damn facts.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hoyer to Dems: Oppose Lerner vote)\n\nHer campaign declined a request for an interview with Ellmers, as it did in other stories where Roche was featured.
