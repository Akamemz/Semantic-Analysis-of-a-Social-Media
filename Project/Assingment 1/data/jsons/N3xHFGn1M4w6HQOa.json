    "content": "With Voters Sour On Major Parties , Group Recruits 'None Of The Above ' Candidates\nIn the middle of a fiercely-fought election between Democrats and Republicans , one group is trying to encourage voters to pick candidates from outside of the two-party system .\nThe effort comes at a time when voters are dissatisfied with both major political parties . Nearly 70 percent of voters say Republicans and Democrats fail to adequately represent the American people , according to a recent survey from the nonpartisan Democracy Fund .\nA Colorado-based group called Unite America is trying to use that dissatisfaction to elect more independent candidates to office nationwide . They have endorsed 29 unaffiliated candidates running for all levels of office from across the country .\nAmong the statewide candidates with the group 's support are Gov . Bill Walker of Alaska , the country 's only unaffiliated governor , and Greg Orman , who 's running for governor in Kansas .\nIn Colorado , they 've helped five state legislative candidates qualify for the ballot , campaign , and get their names out with promotional videos .\nAnthony Cross may be the kind of voter Unite America has in mind . He 's a Democrat who runs an arts magazine in Fort Collins and says he 'd back an unaffiliated candidate , if he agreed with the candidate 's policy positions .\n`` If anything , the last presidential election has kind of proven that both parties in many ways are flawed , the leadership in those parties are flawed , '' Cross said . And even though he likes the idea of backing an unaffiliated candidate , he thinks the chance that he would ultimately vote for someone who is unaffiliated is pretty slim .\n`` There 's a high likelihood that I might not even know that person exists . And that 's the thing . If you do n't know they exist how can you vote for them ? And how can you get that message out ? ''\nUnite America is trying to fill that void by helping the candidates develop their message . Yet on their websites , most Unite America candidates do n't give a lot of details on specific policy proposals .\n`` Everybody wants to put you in a box and wants you to stand in a box so they can clearly define what you are , '' said Paul Jones , who 's in a race against a Democratic state representative in a competitive Colorado district .\nHe believes his independent mindset will resonate with voters who are frustrated and looking for change . `` That 's the problem that we face is that we 're trying to solve complicated issues with very black and white solutions . ''\nIn states like Colorado , unaffiliated voters now outnumber both Republicans and Democrats , but the Democracy Fund survey found that people fed up with the two party system do n't agree on the solution . For example , many unaffiliated voters , like Sue Preston , say they consistently vote for one party or the other . She 's retired and leans Democratic .\n`` I 'm extremely disappointed in Republicans for not taking the initiative to voice their real concerns with this administration , instead of hiding behind their politics and hiding behind oh , I want to get elected this next term , '' said Preston .\nMeanwhile Anthony Pagliaro , who moved to Colorado from Washington DC is also unaffiliated but says he votes Libertarian .\n`` I have trouble voting for Democrats or Republicans . I like a lot of the things both sides have to say and really dislike a lot of things both sides have to say , so it 's hard for me to compromise sometimes . I can be a bit stubborn . ''\nIt 's been more than 100 years since Colorado elected an unaffiliated candidate to the legislature . Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano believes the time is right , and that a purple state like Colorado with a narrowly-divided legislature is the perfect place to launch this movement .\n`` So just two or three or four independents could have a transformative impact , by controlling the balance of power and they can use that in the interest of serving the people , '' said Troiano . `` If no party had an outright majority no one could ram their agenda through , they would need to reach across the aisle for some votes . ''\nBut if that 's the goal , Unite America is n't fielding candidates in the right races to flip control of either of Colorado 's chambers . In the state Senate , where Republicans have a one-seat majority , the group is n't backing candidates in the most competitive races . And in the House , analysts think they could chip away at \u2014 but not overturn \u2014 the Democratic majority .\n`` If some Democratic candidates end up losing in some competitive seats , they might be responsible , '' said former Republican State party Chairman Dick Wadhams .\nRegardless of whether or not their candidates win any races in Colorado or across the nation , even getting four to seven percent of the vote could be enough to act as a spoiler in close races . That factor is a real possibility in the Kansas governor 's race , where polls show that Unite America-backed candidate Greg Orman behind the two major party candidates but drawing significant support .\nWadhams thinks unaffiliated candidates will most appeal to younger voters who tend to be more liberal , but do n't necessarily identify with a party .\n`` They might be particularly attracted to this centrist , non-partisan , bipartisan message . ''\nOne question about the group is how much its largest donors are spending . A top Democratic election attorney has filed a campaign finance complaint with the Colorado Secretary of State 's office alleging that the group and its affiliates are n't being transparent about their donors , and are violating state campaign finance laws .
