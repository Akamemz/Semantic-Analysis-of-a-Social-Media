Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) , declining the committee \u2019 s request for the server to be turned over to an independent third party . The committee said it wants a third party to verify that all Benghazi-related emails were in fact turned over to the panel\u2014especially after Clinton acknowledged deleting anything determined to be \u201c personal \u201d messages .\nKendall called the request pointless , saying Clinton \u2019 s IT staff had confirmed to him the messages are gone for good .\nBut permanent deletion is extremely difficult to achieve , the experts said . Enterprise servers built in the last decade or so are increasingly designed to preserve emails more rigorously , either as a document trail in case of a lawsuit , to comply with industry regulations or to allow system administrators to \u201c idiot proof \u201d their systems so they can save the day when non-technically proficient executives accidentally delete emails .\nThe key principle of digital forensics is \u201c Delete doesn \u2019 t and restore won \u2019 t , \u201d said Mark Rasch , a former federal prosecutor who worked on computer crimes .\nA telling precedent is the case of former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner , who came under scrutiny over charges that the IRS targeted tea party groups for heightened scrutiny .\nThe IRS said that a 2011 hard-drive crash rendered her emails irretrievable .
