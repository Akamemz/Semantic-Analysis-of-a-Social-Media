But \u201cmy head says she runs; my gut says she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nSee Excerpts from Karl Rove's Interview with Newsmax\n\nThe scandals facing the White House \u2014 particularly the Benghazi attack of last Sept. 11 \u2014 will be corrosive to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Republican strategist Karl Rove tells Newsmax TV in an exclusive interview.\u201cThese things will be corrosive,\u201d Rove, who helped George W. Bush twice win the White House, tells Newsmax. \u201cThey'll eat away at the president's rating. We'll see it over time and, particularly, as Congress asks more questions in the weeks ahead.\u201cThis stuff is only starting to seep in,\u201d Rove adds. \u201cIt will take a while for these things to sort of sink in. I am not surprised that it hasn\u2019t begun to impact his job approval just yet.\u201dRove, who also served as deputy chief of staff in the Bush White House, is a Fox News analyst. His latest book is \u2018Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight.\u201dStory continues below the video:Most troubling for Rove is how the Obama administration has grossly mismanaged the information \u2014 before and after \u2014 surrounding the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Libya, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\u201cThe West Wing was complicit in the Benghazi lie,\u201d Rove declares to Newsmax. \u201cAnd, look, I believe that, ultimately, the president is responsible for setting the tone.\u201dHe noted how U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice went on five Sunday morning talks shows five days after the attacks \u2014 working from talking points that were heavily edited largely at the request of the State Department \u2014 and said that the assaults began as a peaceful protest against an anti-Muslim film that was later \u201chijacked\u201d by militants.\u201cYou don\u2019t send out Susan Rice to go on five Sunday morning talk programs unless somebody in the West Wing has said, \u2018Let's send her out\u2019 \u2014 and somebody in the West Wing has said this is what she needs to say or said, \u2018O.K., that's an interesting idea. You ought to go ahead and say that.\u2019\u201dHe says that the controversies \u2014 which also include the targeting of tea party and conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service and the recent secret seizure of telephone records of editors and reporters at The Associated Press \u2014 point to a haughty commander in chief.\u201cI do see an arrogance, a belief that the rules somehow don't apply to him \u2014 that the norms that other presidents have abided by should not be respected and that he is free to do something that he would criticize in others,\u201d Rove said.\u201cDo you believe that if the Bush administration had gone after The New York Times in the same fashion that President Obama went after the AP and Fox News that then-Senator Obama would not have been on the floor of the Senate raising hell? Of course he would have.\u201cThere's lots of things that he has done that are inappropriate.\u201dBut the most egregious will always be Benghazi, Rove says.\u201cThis involves the president himself,\u201d he declares to Newsmax. \u201cHe is the commander in chief, and at 4:08 p.m. on the afternoon on Sept. 11 in Washington, our government received word that attack was underway on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi.\u201cAt 5 p.m., the president was told about this by the Secretary of Defense [Leon Panetta] and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [Gen. Martin Dempsey], who were in the office for a half-hour meeting on another subject.\u201cThe president ordered them to deploy whatever forces were necessary,\u201d Rove adds. \u201cThey later testified that was the last contact they had with the president that night \u2014 and we now know that no forces were deployed.\u201cThe president didn't say: \u2018I'm going to pick up the phone and call the president of Libya and say: Our facility's under attack. You have an international responsibility to protect our people. What are you doing?\u2019 He talks to him for the first time ever the next morning to say thank you for returning the body of our dead ambassador.\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d Rove continues. \u201cWhere was the president? What was he doing? Who concocted this lie that was told to the American people? We know that it's a total, complete fabrication, a lie \u2014 and we still don\u2019t know who was the person who authored that and told her to go say that?\u201cIt's somebody sitting in the West Wing of the White House \u2014 and their motivation was to protect the president against criticism that the war on terror was not over and that this was a terrorist attack.\u201dIn his wide-ranging exclusive Newsmax interview, Rove also says:",
