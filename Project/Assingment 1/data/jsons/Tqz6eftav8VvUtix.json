Wow , it 's okay to say that now ! ' ''\n`` That is an anecdote that speaks to a larger truth , that President-elect Trump 's win has dealt a serious blow to the totalitarian instincts , political correctness , progressivism and the extreme prejudice that is championed by that political correctness . ''\nDuring his campaign , even in the sweltering heat of the summertime campaign stops , Trump was talking about Christmas . He tapped into the pent-up anger felt by millions of Americans over the perceived `` War on Christmas '' at our government 's highest level , the White House , and the trickle-down impact of it throughout the American culture during the Obama administration .\nNow , he 's fulfilling his promise . During his `` thank you '' tour Trump is traveling the country speaking to the masses from a podium emblazoned with a big , red sign that reads , `` Merry Christmas '' -- words he also articulates to each audience , usually more than once during his speech . As if that 's not enough , he is flanked by two Christmas trees on the stage . Those who are fortunate to receive a Christmas card from the Trump family will notice it says `` Merry Christmas . ''\nContrast that to the current president , Barack Obama , whose family card sent this time of year omits the phrase , `` Merry Christmas '' as it has during the entire eight years of his presidency , instead opting for the politically correct , `` Happy Holidays . '' There is no mention of Christmas , not even in the message , which according to The Washington Times reads , `` As our family reflects on our many happy years spent in the White House , we are grateful for the friends we 've made , the joy we 've shared , and the gifts of kindness we 've received . We wish you and your loved ones a joyous holiday season and a wonderful new year . ''\nChristians helped put Trump over the finish line . An astounding 81 percent of white Evangelicals voted for the billionaire businessman .\n`` Our President-elect Trump will foster a federal government that is much more friendly to traditional beliefs about Christianity in the public square , '' Land said . `` People are grateful for that , and they feel it\u2014that the federal government will no longer be working as a public censor , and Americans are enjoying their newfound rights to communicate their true beliefs about Christmas . Mr. Trump has said we 're free to say 'Merry Christmas ' again . And so this is , broadly speaking , a win for cultural conservatism , which in America is intertwined with orthodox , traditional Christianity over progressivism and multi-culturalism . ''",
