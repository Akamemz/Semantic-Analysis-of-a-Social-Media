    "content": "Global confidence in US leadership has fallen to a new low , and the country now ranks below China in worldwide approval ratings , according to a new Gallup poll .\nThe survey of opinion in 134 countries showed a record collapse in approval for the US role in the world , from 48 % under Obama to 30 % after one year of Donald Trump \u2013 the lowest level Gallup has recorded since beginning its global leadership poll over a decade ago .\nThe result comes after a separate Gallup survey found that Trump reaches the first anniversary of his inauguration with the lowest average approval rating of any elected president in his first year .\nThat poll showed that Trump has averaged just a 39 % approval rating since his inauguration . The previous low was held by Bill Clinton , whose first-year average was 10 points higher than Trump \u2019 s , at 49 % .\nThe latest study confirms some of the worst fears of foreign policy analysts in the US and Europe that Trump \u2019 s \u201c America first \u201d approach , combined with his volatile and irascible personality , is weakening cohesion among western democracies in the face of a growing challenge from autocracies in Russia and China , and the rise of illiberal democracies and xenophobic nationalism inside Europe .\nGermany is now seen as a global leader by many more people ( 41 % of the sample ) , with China in second place on 31 % .
