    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama announced Thursday that millions of illegal immigrants will gain protections from deportation , bypassing Congress and unleashing unpredictable political and economic forces .\nThe plan will give more than four million illegal immigrants the chance to apply for work permits and a temporary reprieve from deportation . People who have been in the U.S. for at least five years and are parents of citizens or legal permanent residents would be eligible to apply . The White House said nearly a million more could benefit through other new or expanded programs . The president also is narrowing the group of people who would be subject to deportation , in what the White House said was an effort to focus enforcement resources on gang members , serious criminals and those who crossed the border after Jan. 1 , 2014 .\n\u201c What I \u2019 m describing is accountability\u2014a common-sense , middle ground approach : If you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . If you \u2019 re a criminal , you \u2019 ll be deported , \u201d Mr. Obama said in describing his executive action .\nRepublicans criticized the move as presidential overreach . \u201c The action he \u2019 s proposed would ignore the law , would reject the voice of the voters , and would impose new unfairness on law-abiding immigrants\u2014all without solving the problem , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) .\nMr. Obama said his move was well-grounded in law and precedent and challenged Republicans to pass a bill if they don \u2019 t like it . He noted contributions immigrants make to the nation , and said it was neither realistic nor desirable to deport all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants .\nHe also rejected accusations that his policy amounts to amnesty , and said it would rightly deport those who represent real threats . \u201c Felons , not families . Criminals , not children . Gang members , not a mom who \u2019 s working hard to provide for her kids , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 ll prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s plan contained only minor benefits for businesses that crave more visas for foreign workers and which have lobbied unsuccessfully for action in Congress . A new program will expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria . But White House officials said they opted against a plan , favored by high-tech companies , to make visas available from those unused in prior years , after concluding they couldn \u2019 t justify it legally .\nBy giving work papers to millions of illegal workers , Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan could affect businesses in unexpected ways , enabling workers to seek new jobs and higher wages to the benefit of some business sectors more than others . Some in agriculture , for example , worried that affected workers would leave for other sectors .\nA 1986 law , which offered legal status to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants , had an almost immediate labor-market impact , with many low-wage workers moving to other jobs that pay better .\nSenior administration officials said the legal justification for Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan was based on the principle of prosecutorial discretion\u2014there are insufficient resources to target all 11.3 million illegal immigrants , so the administration can assert priorities .\nAdvocates for immigrants , who lobbied Mr. Obama to act without waiting for approval from lawmakers , planned celebrations and rallies across the country . A crowd gathered outside the gates of the White House shouting , \u201c Si se pudo ! \u201d or \u201c Yes we could ! \u201d in Spanish . In an East Los Angeles immigrant enclave , people were tuned in to Spanish-language television at mom and pop shops . Univision offered simultaneous translation of the president \u2019 s speech into Spanish .\n\u201c I feel like everything I did now is paying off , \u201d said Martha Sanchez Almaraz , of Shakopee , Minn. , who advocated for the change and stands to benefit from it . Two of her three children are U.S. citizens . \u201c Sometimes , I felt like this would never happen . \u201d\nAs a candidate , Mr. Obama had vowed to make an immigration overhaul a priority in his first year . That didn \u2019 t happen . He pushed for legislation as his second term opened , but a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate died in the GOP-run House .\nNow , with two years left in office , Mr. Obama has turned to unilateral action . But the new protections in the executive action are temporary and the entire policy could be reversed by a future president .\nRepublicans in Congress have been looking for ways to block implementation of the Obama policy . Many have suggested using legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 , needed to keep the government funded , as a vehicle for enacting limits on Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies .\nThat idea hit a roadblock Thursday when the House Appropriations Committee said that Congress can \u2019 t defund the primary agency involved in Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan , U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , because it is self-funded by fees . In fact , the agency could continue operating even if the rest of the government shut down .\nPresident Reagan signed a law making sweeping immigration changes . President Obama is taking executive action . What are the differences in their plans ? WSJ \u2019 s Jason Bellini has # TheShortAnswer .\nSome GOP lawmakers favor filing a lawsuit , challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Obama \u2019 s action . Others suggested potentially withholding funding for other parts of the president \u2019 s agenda .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s action raised the question of whether immigration legislation was now dead for the rest of his term\u2014as GOP leaders said his unilateral action would \u201c poison the well \u201d in working with Congress\u2014or whether it created new pressures for lawmakers to revisit the issue .\nSome lawmakers said Congress may respond to Mr. Obama by renewing efforts to pass legislation , likely in piecemeal fashion , as many Republicans have advocated . \u201c Congress needs to re-establish its authority in this , \u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson ( R. , Idaho ) . \u201c Ultimately , we \u2019 ve got to solve the problem , so why not just start doing it ? \u201d\nSen. Chris Murphy ( D. , Conn. ) said the president \u2019 s actions are \u201c a forcing mechanism . Republicans can sit down and negotiate with us tomorrow to make this executive action last all of a few weeks . \u201d\nThe executive action satisfies few priorities of business groups , which are now regrouping . Mr. Obama \u2019 s new policy will allow companies to employ certain workers who are waiting for their visas to clear , and it will expand a program that helps foreign students who have graduated and are awaiting work visas . Unions complained about both provisions , but they fall well short of legislative changes that business wants : more legal visas for high-skilled and low-skilled workers .\n\u201c Republicans will have an opportunity in the next Congress to put forward bills to address our dysfunctional immigration system , \u201d said U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes .\nThe most controversial part of the plan is a new \u201c deferred action \u201d program , which gives a temporary reprieve from deportation and the chance to apply for work permits . Parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents will be eligible for the program . To qualify , they will have to undergo a background check and pay application fees .\nIn addition , the administration is expanding criteria for an existing program that gives the same benefits to young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children , sometimes called Dreamers , making about 270,000 people newly eligible .\nHowever , senior administration officials said they couldn \u2019 t legally justify giving shelter to the parents of these young people . They said that Congress had recognized the importance of the relationship between children and their immigrant parents , in that citizens are able to sponsor their parents for green cards . But there is no such justification for the parents of Dreamers , who have no legal status of their own , they said .\nFor similar reasons , they said , they considered but didn \u2019 t create a special program for farm workers .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a bittersweet moment for us , \u201d said Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez , a Brazilian immigrant who was raised in Florida and has legal protections under the existing program . \u201c Many people who got us to this point won \u2019 t have the relief of knowing their parents are protected from deportation . \u201d\nThe plan also makes changes to the enforcement regime . Under newly crafted guidelines , gang members , those with serious criminal convictions and people who crossed the border after Jan. 1 , 2014 , will top the list of priorities for deportation .
