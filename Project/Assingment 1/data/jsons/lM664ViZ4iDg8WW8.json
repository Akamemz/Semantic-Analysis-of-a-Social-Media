    "content": "Levin called Obama \u2019 s effort \u201c police state \u201d tactics , and suggested that Obama \u2019 s actions , rather than conspiracy theories about alleged Russian interference in the presidential election to help Trump , should be the target of congressional investigation .\nDrawing on sources including the New York Times and the Washington Post , Levin described the case against Obama so far , based on what is already publicly known . The following is an expanded version of that case , including events that Levin did not mention specifically but are important to the overall timeline .\n1 . June 2016 : FISA request . The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISA ) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers . The request , uncharacteristically , is denied .\n2 . July : Russia joke . Wikileaks releases emails from the Democratic National Committee that show an effort to prevent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) from winning the presidential nomination . In a press conference , Donald Trump refers to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s own missing emails , joking : \u201c Russia , if you \u2019 re listening , I hope you \u2019 re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. \u201d That remark becomes the basis for accusations by Clinton and the media that Trump invited further hacking .\n3 . October : Podesta emails . In October , Wikileaks releases the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta , rolling out batches every day until the election , creating new mini-scandals . The Clinton campaign blames Trump and the Russians .\n4 . October : FISA request . The Obama administration submits a new , narrow request to the FISA court , now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks . No evidence is found \u2014 but the wiretaps continue , ostensibly for national security reasons , Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes . The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services .\n5 . January 2017 : Buzzfeed/CNN dossier . Buzzfeed releases , and CNN reports , a supposed intelligence \u201c dossier \u201d compiled by a foreign former spy . It purports to show continuous contact between Russia and the Trump campaign , and says that the Russians have compromising information about Trump . None of the allegations can be verified and some are proven false . Several media outlets claim that they had been aware of the dossier for months and that it had been circulating in Washington .\n6 . January : Obama expands NSA sharing . As Michael Walsh later notes , and as the New York Times reports , the outgoing Obama administration \u201c expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government \u2019 s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. \u201d The new powers , and reduced protections , could make it easier for intelligence on private citizens to be circulated improperly or leaked .\n7 . January : Times report . The New York Times reports , on the eve of Inauguration Day , that several agencies \u2014 the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and the Treasury Department are monitoring several associates of the Trump campaign suspected of Russian ties . Other news outlets also report the exisentence of \u201c a multiagency working group to coordinate investigations across the government , \u201d though it is unclear how they found out , since the investigations would have been secret and involved classified information .\n8 . February : Mike Flynn scandal . Reports emerge that the FBI intercepted a conversation in 2016 between future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 then a private citizen \u2014 and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . The intercept supposedly was part of routine spying on the ambassador , not monitoring of the Trump campaign . The FBI transcripts reportedly show the two discussing Obama \u2019 s newly-imposed sanctions on Russia , though Flynn earlier denied discussing them . Sally Yates , whom Trump would later fire as acting Attorney General for insubordination , is involved in the investigation . In the end , Flynn resigns over having misled Vice President Mike Pence ( perhaps inadvertently ) about the content of the conversation .\n9 . February : Times claims extensive Russian contacts . The New York Times cites \u201c four current and former American officials \u201d in reporting that the Trump campaign had \u201c repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials . The Trump campaign denies the claims \u2014 and the Times admits that there is \u201c no evidence \u201d of coordination between the campaign and the Russians . The White House and some congressional Republicans begin to raise questions about illegal intelligence leaks .\n10 . March : the Washington Post targets Jeff Sessions . The Washington Post reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had contact twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign \u2014 once at a Heritage Foundation event and once at a meeting in Sessions \u2019 s Senate office . The Post suggests that the two meetings contradict Sessions \u2019 s testimony at his confirmation hearings that he had no contacts with the Russians , though in context ( not presented by the Post ) it was clear he meant in his capacity as a campaign surrogate , and that he was responding to claims in the \u201c dossier \u201d of ongoing contacts . The New York Times , in covering the story , adds that the Obama White House \u201c rushed to preserve \u201d intelligence related to alleged Russian links with the Trump campaign . By \u201c preserve \u201d it really means \u201c disseminate \u201d : officials spread evidence throughout other government agencies \u201c to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators \u201d and perhaps the media as well .",
