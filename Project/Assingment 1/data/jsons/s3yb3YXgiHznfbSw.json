    "content": "Baltimore has erupted . Its citizens have taken to the streets to rebel against an undue and all-too-common show of excessive force against citizens by the police . Most recently , the Baltimore Police applied such force when arresting 25-year-old Freddie Gray that they severed his spinal cord . Arrested apparently for making eye contact with the police -- essentially for daring to look while Black -- Gray was denied medical care . He ended up in a coma and died seven days after being arrested .\nOn Monday , despite calls for a peaceful day out of respect for Freddie \u2019 s burial , protesters took to the streets , smashing stores , burning buildings , and taking property from a mall , a CVS , and a check casher . These acts of justifiable rage and rebellion whipped the media and government officials into a frenzy , calling for the \u201c thugs \u201d and \u201c criminals \u201d of Baltimore to be arrested and locked up . A procession of respectable-sounding Black folks got on television , the Rev . Jamal Harrison Bryant the most visible among them , calling for peace and an end to the violence .\nI watched on the news as people smashed the windows of the check casher . And I couldn \u2019 t muster even the faintest anger or outrage toward them . The presence of these check-cashing businesses is one of the key physical features of Black and poor neighborhoods that you rarely see in affluent neighborhoods -- places where poor people , in the absence of bank accounts , are forced to pay exorbitant fees just to access the money they have fairly earned . These kinds of businesses prey on our most vulnerable citizens , and do so under the guise of offering a needed service . That the residents chose that business to smash suggests that at least some of them recognize the ways in which such companies extract the meager resources of local residents . Others may simply have thought there was money on the premises .\nBut the idea that all citizens who rebel against an unjust system must have righteous intentions in order for their actions to be worthy of respect is simply ludicrous . The oppressed are not a monolith . They don \u2019 t move or think with one mind . They don \u2019 t all react to injustice in the same way . Nor should they .\nThe right of the people to revolt in response to unjust conditions is a founding principle of this Republic . But another founding principle of this republic is that Black people are not fully human . Therefore they are not legitimately `` the people , '' not a part of the `` demos '' in democracy . Thus revolution and rebellion remain the province and property of America 's white citizens . All other comers are illegitimate .\nThe Baltimore rebellion arises at a singular moment in history , as three Black women have been tasked with restoring law and order : The first is Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake , who gave a statement on Monday condemning the \u201c thugs \u201d doing violence in the city . The second is Gen. Linda Singh , an officer with the Maryland National Guard , who appeared in military fatigues , in a show of state force and authority . And finally , there is Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who was being sworn in at the exact same moment that the protests erupted in Baltimore .\nWhat does it mean that three Black women have an unprecedented amount of municipal , national and military power to put down a rebellion ? I must admit I am conflicted . When you grow up as a Black girl overachiever in this country , you are taught that the levels of power and prestige that these three women have are the very kinds of power and access that our ancestors fought and died for us to even have the possibility of experiencing . Simply on the basis of Black exceptionalism , I am supposed to be magnificently proud of these three women \u2013 of the kind of possibility they represent .\nNot one of these women stands in the place of power she stands in without having battled for it : Take , for example , the GOP \u2019 s now-legendary obstruction of Lynch \u2019 s nomination . In a similar vein , climbing through the military ranks and landing a position of substantial authority , as Singh has done , is notoriously difficult for any woman . Just look to the sexist comments Rawlings-Blake has faced on social media in recent days for a sign of what a woman in authority faces on a regular basis .\nBut our ancestors did not fight for us to get access to these spaces just so that we could act like white supremacists in Blackface . They wanted us there so we could do the work of justice . So while my Black feminist , Black woman , Black girl overachiever self wants to stand and champion these women and their presences as a triumph of American democracy , I can not .\nTheir presence proves that American empire , in its most democratic iteration , is no respecter of persons . Any person willing to do the state \u2019 s bidding can have a role to play .

But it is rooted in a fundamental kind of dishonesty . For respectable citizens , a shattering of the peace sounds like broken windows and burning businesses . But I would submit that the shattering of the peace for Baltimore \u2019 s poor and disenfranchised residents sounds much quieter -- it sounds like the snapping of Freddie Gray \u2019 s neck , and the crushing of his voice box so no one could hear his screams , in the back of a van driven by those sworn to protect him .\nTo narrate the story in any other way is to propagate a pathological level of deception about who the real criminals and the real victims are . To continue to condemn as senseless acts of violence things that actually make perfect damn sense is only to further this pathology .
