    "content": "The former vice president , who formally announced his candidacy on Thursday but has been a frontrunner in the polls for months , recently called himself an \u201c Obama-Biden Democrat , \u201d evoking a repeat of 2008 . His supporters have long held that he can connect with the white working-class voters who switched from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in 2016 .\nAnd when he responded , earlier this month , to allegations that he touched women inappropriately , he cast himself as a man innocently following the mores of an earlier era .\n\u201c Social norms have begun to change , they \u2019 ve shifted , \u201d he said . \u201c The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset . \u201d\nTo some , statements like that \u2014 along with his lack of an actual apology \u2014 signal a man out of touch with the # MeToo movement and America today . But Biden is betting that there \u2019 s another , bigger group out there \u2014 a group that thinks # MeToo goes a little too far , and maybe norms have changed a little too fast .\nWhere he once strived to embrace positions taken by his more progressive rivals , Biden now seems to be playing to divisions in the Democratic Party over # MeToo and other social issues . Those divisions are real \u2014 as of 2017 , a significant percentage of Democrats were closer to Republicans on issues like racial discrimination , LGBTQ rights , and sexism .\nBut in 2020 , playing to those Democrats may not be a winning strategy . Recent polling shows that Democrats are becoming more supportive of # MeToo , not less . And a growing number of voters want to see more women and people of color running for office .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a good time for an older , white establishment man to be running , especially one for whom # MeToo boundaries may be unclear , \u201d said Tresa Undem , a cofounder of the research firm PerryUndem , which has conducted recent polling on elections and # MeToo .\nPut another way , there may be a culture war going on within the Democratic Party . But Biden may not have chosen the winning side .\nTo some degree , Joe Biden \u2019 s political career has been about evolution . He went from an opponent of school integration in the 1970s to a critic of systemic racism in 2019 , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Matt Yglesias pointed out . In 1982 , he voted for a constitutional amendment to let states overturn Roe v. Wade , but his spokesperson now casts him as a defender of the landmark abortion decision . During the 2008 primary contest , he sparked criticism when he called Barack Obama \u201c the first sort of mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy \u201d ; he later apologized and became Obama \u2019 s running mate .\nBiden also presided over the 1991 hearings at which Anita Hill testified that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her , but he has tried to distance himself from the outcome of those hearings , most recently saying , \u201c I wish I could have done something \u201d to give Hill \u201c the hearing she deserved . \u201d\nIt can seem like Biden is forever playing catch-up , eventually arriving at positions more socially progressive politicians staked out long before him . But in recent comments , there \u2019 s been another dynamic at work .\n\u201c I \u2019 m an Obama-Biden Democrat , man , and I \u2019 m proud of it , \u201d he told reporters earlier this month . He argued that Democrats don \u2019 t need to be socialists to be progressive and seemed to voice skepticism about candidates to the left of him : \u201c Show me the really , left , left , left winger who beat a Republican \u201d in 2018 , he said .\nAlso in early April , he tweeted a video statement in response to allegations that he had touched multiple women in ways that made them uncomfortable .\nSocial norms are changing . I understand that , and I \u2019 ve heard what these women are saying . Politics to me has always been about making connections , but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future . That \u2019 s my responsibility and I will meet it . pic.twitter.com/Ya2mf5ODts \u2014 Joe Biden ( @ JoeBiden ) April 3 , 2019\nIt was structured like an apology , but Biden didn \u2019 t actually apologize . Instead , he described himself as an old-school hugger in a new , post- # MeToo world .\n\u201c I shake hands , I hug people , I grab men and women by the shoulders and say , \u2018 You can do this. \u2019 Whether they are women , men , young , old , it \u2019 s the way I \u2019 ve always been , \u201d he said .\nBiden said he would change , becoming more \u201c mindful \u201d of people \u2019 s personal space . But he also promised not to change too much . \u201c I \u2019 ll always believe governing \u2014 quite frankly , life , for that matter \u2014 is about connecting with people , \u201d he said .\nThe statement , and his \u201c Obama-Biden Democrat \u201d comments , felt pitched at voters who were nostalgic for an earlier time \u2014 before Trump , yes , but also before # MeToo and the rise of socialism . A time when things felt \u2014 to some people , at least \u2014 less complicated .\nBuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith recently called Biden \u201c the stand-in for a generation of Americans disoriented by changing mores , \u201d and it feels like as good an encapsulation as any of Biden \u2019 s recent non-campaign campaign . Biden seems to be betting that there are people who will vote for him not in spite of the fact that he seems like a candidate from an earlier time , but because of it .\nA significant number of Democrats are conservative on cultural issues . But that number might be shrinking .\nIn a 2018 paper , Vanderbilt University political scientist Larry Bartels analyzed how Americans stacked up on a scale of \u201c cultural conservatism , \u201d as measured by agreement with statements like \u201c discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities \u201d and \u201c women who complain about harassment often cause more problems than they solve . \u201d\nBeliefs like this are more often associated with Republicans , but Bartels found that many Democrats agreed with them too \u2014 in fact , he wrote , more than a quarter of Democrats were closer to the average Republican on cultural issues than to the average member of their own party .\nIt \u2019 s possible to imagine Biden \u2019 s recent statements appealing to those Democrats who subscribe to culturally conservative beliefs \u2014 about harassment in particular \u2014 but still want an alternative to the Republican Party and Trump .\nHowever , it \u2019 s not entirely clear that Biden has those voters locked down \u2014 culturally conservative Democrats actually favored Bernie Sanders over Biden slightly more than their more culturally liberal counterparts , according to Bartels .\nMoreover , Bartels \u2019 s analysis is based on data collected in November 2017 \u2014 after the # MeToo movement entered its most public phase , but before the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh made the movement part of national politics in a new way . Things may have changed since then .\nBartels told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he would speculate that the continued # MeToo movement would cause Democrats to move away from the idea that women who complain about harassment cause problems , and that the allegations against Biden might come to hurt him .\nThere is evidence that the Kavanaugh hearings have changed Democrats \u2019 attitudes on gender issues . The hearings made people think about power in America , according to an analysis by PerryUndem \u2014 who has it , who doesn \u2019 t , and what effects those power disparities have .\nIn the firm \u2019 s polling , 78 percent of registered Democrats said the hearings made them think about men having more power than women in government . Four in 10 Democratic men said they felt less tolerant of sexism in their own lives as a result of the hearings . Democratic men and women were more likely in 2018 than in 2016 to say that women make better political leaders than men . And in 2018 , 83 percent of Democrats said the country would be better off with more women in office .\nThe poll did not ask about specific 2020 candidates , but it may have implications for them .\n\u201c Although Biden has the name recognition and leads in polls , I think he faces an uphill battle , \u201d Tresa Undem , the PerryUndem co-founder , said .\nSome say Biden can win back the white working class . What about other voters ?\nThere \u2019 s also a question of who Biden \u2019 s candidacy is supposed to appeal to . He \u2019 s long been seen as someone who can win back the white working-class Americans who voted for Trump in 2016 . But the notion that Trump won on the strength of white , working-class voters \u2014 and that Clinton lost by ignoring them \u2014 has been called into question since 2016 , in large part because many polls show most Trump voters were affluent , not working class .\nThe 2018 midterm elections , meanwhile , drove home the electoral power of women voters of color . Ninety-two percent of black women voted for Democrats nationwide , compared with only 49 percent of white women . Black women in particular helped make the difference for Clinton in the 2016 primary as well as more recent congressional races , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Li Zhou notes , and women and voters of color in general have been increasing their share of Democratic primary participation since 2008 .\nBiden \u2019 s poll numbers among women of color are mixed \u2014 he leads the field among black and Native American women , according to recent Morning Consult polling data provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but comes in second behind Bernie Sanders among Asian American women and women who identified their race as \u201c other . \u201d\nAnd according to Marcela Howell , president and CEO of In Our Own Voice : National Black Women \u2019 s Reproductive Justice Agenda , Biden has built some credibility with female voters of color with his time as vice president and his role as the architect of the Violence Against Women Act . \u201c He walks into this race with at least the benefit of the doubt from women of color , \u201d Howell told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHowell does not see the allegations of inappropriate touching as an insurmountable problem for Biden . \u201c Hugging is not sexual assault , \u201d she said . Nor does she see Biden \u2019 s handling of the Thomas confirmation hearings as a major issue for black female voters , at least so far .\nBut , Howell cautioned , the Democratic field is still \u201c wide open. \u201d And in a recent poll conducted by Intersections of Our Lives , a collaborative of reproductive justice groups including In Our Own Voice , 88 percent of female voters of color said they wanted to see more women candidates running for office , and 85 percent said they wanted more candidates of color . The poll did not ask about specific 2020 candidates .\nThe media \u201c seems to act as if this race is between all the white men , \u201d Howell said . \u201c I think they \u2019 re going to be in for a shock by the time you get to South Carolina and Super Tuesday . \u201d\nSeventy-eight percent of women of color in the Intersections of Our Lives poll said that politicians fail to acknowledge the issues that matter most to them .\nMany of the women of color in the poll said their elected officials \u201c don \u2019 t really understand them , \u201d said Choimorrow of the National Asian Pacific American Women \u2019 s Forum , which was also part of Intersections of Our Lives .\nThe allegations against Biden , coupled with his comment that Obama was \u201c articulate , \u201d might make female voters of color feel he doesn \u2019 t understand their concerns , Choimorrow said .\n\u201c Those are the kinds of things that get people to say , my elected person doesn \u2019 t really know me , \u201d Choimorrow said . \u201c As a person of color , having a white person say to you , you \u2019 re so articulate \u2014 we know what that means . \u201d\nAnd as a voter , \u201c I \u2019 m looking for someone who is authentic and really understands that our country is not what it was even 10 , 15 , 20 years ago , \u201d Choimorrow said .\nJoe Biden has always changed with the times , and perhaps his 2020 candidacy will see him evolve again . But to do it successfully , he may need to look forward , not back .",
