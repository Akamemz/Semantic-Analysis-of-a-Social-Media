    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump is trying to clean up a racially charged controversy Monday after he refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke over the weekend .\nWhen asked about his comments on CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' Trump blamed a `` bad earpiece . ''\n`` I was sitting in a house in Florida , with a bad earpiece , '' the brash billionaire told NBC 's `` Today '' show . `` I could hardly hear what he 's saying . I hear various groups . I do n't mind disavowing anyone . I disavowed Duke the day before at a major conference . ''\nIn the hours that followed Trump 's original comments , the real estate mogul used Twitter to explain his remarks amid an outpouring of criticism from his Republican presidential rivals . Sen. Marco Rubio slammed the remarks , saying they make Trump `` unelectable . ''\nThe Sunday uproar started when Trump was asked by Tapper whether he would disavow Duke and other white supremacist groups that are supporting his campaign .\n`` Just so you understand , I do n't know anything about David Duke , OK ? '' Trump said .\nTrump was pressed three times on whether he 'd distance himself from the Ku Klux Klan -- but never mentioned the group in his answers .\n`` I do n't know anything about what you 're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists , '' he said . `` So I do n't know . I do n't know -- did he endorse me , or what 's going on ? Because I know nothing about David Duke ; I know nothing about white supremacists . ''\nDuke had detailed his support for Trump in a Facebook post on Thursday\n`` I think he deserves a close look by those who believe the era of political correctness needs to come to an end , '' Duke wrote .\nHe touted Trump 's strength on immigration , breaking up `` Jewish dominated lobbies and super PACS that are corrupting and controlling American politics , '' preventing war with Russia , exposing media `` lies '' and ensuring `` that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do . ''\nThe Anti-Defamation League had called on Trump to repudiate the support of Duke , the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , and other white supremacist groups .\nDespite what he said Sunday , Trump apparently did know Duke in 2000 -- citing him , as well as Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani -- in a statement that year explaining why he had decided to end his brief flirtation with a Reform Party presidential campaign .\n`` The Reform Party now includes a Klansman , Mr. Duke , a neo-Nazi , Mr. Buchanan , and a communist , Ms. Fulani . This is not company I wish to keep , '' Trump said in a statement reported then by The New York Times\nHe had also indicated he knew of Duke during a Friday press conference , when he was asked similar questions and said : `` David Duke endorsed me ? OK , all right . I disavow , OK ? ''\nAfter his appearance on `` State of the Union , '' Trump highlighted that Friday comment in a tweet , saying he does disavow Duke .\nAs I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow . pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 28 , 2016\nDuring the interview , though , asked if he 'd broadly distance himself from Duke and white supremacists , Trump demurred , saying he knew nothing about their support for his bid for the Republican presidential nomination .\n`` I have to look at the group . I mean , I do n't know what group you 're talking about , '' Trump said . `` You would n't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about . I 'd have to look . If you would send me a list of the groups , I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong . You may have groups in there that are totally fine -- it would be very unfair . So give me a list of the groups and I 'll let you know . ''\nTapper responded : `` OK . I 'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here , but -- ''\nAnd Trump said : `` Honestly , I do n't know David Duke . I do n't believe I 've ever met him . I 'm pretty sure I did n't meet him . And I just do n't know anything about him . ''\nTrump 's comments came two days before 12 states -- largely Southern -- vote on Super Tuesday . If he defeats Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rubio in most or all of those states , Trump could become a near lock for the Republican nomination .\nRubio slammed Trump during a rally in Virginia , highlighting Trump 's 2000 comment about Duke as he pointed out that Trump did know of the white supremacist leader .\n`` We can not be the party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan , '' Rubio said .\n`` By the way , not only is that wrong , it makes him unelectable . How are we going to grow our party with a nominee that refuses to condemn the Ku Klux Klan ? '' he said . `` Do n't tell me he does n't know what the Ku Klux Klan is . This is serious . ''\nAnd on Sunday night Sen. Tim Scott , a South Carolina Republican who is backing Rubio -- and one of two African-American senators -- in a statement blasted Trump 's response .\n`` Any candidate who can not immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party , and will not unite it . If Donald Trump ca n't take a stand against the KKK , we can not trust him to stand up for America against Putin , Iran or ISIS . ''\nCruz hit Trump on Twitter , saying , `` Really sad . @ realDonaldTrump you 're better than this . We should all agree , racism is wrong , KKK is abhorrent .
