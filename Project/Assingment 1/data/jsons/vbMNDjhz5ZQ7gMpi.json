Rand Paul relinquished the Senate floor late Wednesday night , ending his `` filibuster '' over National Security Agency surveillance programs authorized under the Patriot Act .\nPaul , R-Kentucky , ran through several binders of material over the course of his marathon protest , and also got some help from 10 fellow senators -- three Republicans and seven Democrats .\nSens . Ron Wyden , D-Oregon , and Mike Lee , R-Utah , were the biggest boons to Paul 's efforts , joining Paul on the Senate floor several times to give the Kentucky Republican a chance to catch his breath -- and often grab a sip of water and pop a candy in his mouth . And one of Paul 's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , also ended up helping Paul 's efforts late in the night .\n`` There comes a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer . That time is now and I will not let the Patriot Act , the most unpatriotic of acts , go unchallenged , '' Paul said at the opening of his remarks , and those who joined him on the Senate floor shared his concerns and stressed the need to reform the Patriot Act .\nThe Senate is considering whether to reauthorize or reform a crucial section of that law that gives the government sweeping powers to collect phone metadata on millions of Americans in an effort to thwart terrorist plots .
