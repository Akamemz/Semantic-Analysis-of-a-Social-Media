Instead , it was the day that the UK \u2019 s parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May \u2019 s awful Brexit deal for the third time .\nMay has lost power in great chunks since grabbing the PM job when David Cameron resigned . She called a snap election in 2017 and lost her party \u2019 s majority in Parliament in the result .\nHer critics in the UK and the EU have levied severe criticism for her action invoking Article 50 of the EU \u2019 s principal treaty , triggering the two-year period to negotiate an exit deal before she had any plan for negotiating such a deal . Those criticisms are all correct , but do nothing to resolve the crisis that Brexit has come to be .\nMay \u2019 s deal includes the \u201c Irish backstop , \u201d a provision designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic . If invoked by the EU after a transition period that lasts until the end of 2020 , the backstop would effectively keep the entire UK in the EU indefinitely .\nThe backstop is just one of the biggest stumbling blocks in May \u2019 s deal . ( The Irish are being at least slightly more helpful than they were during Easter week 1916 . )\nThe backstop , and other features of May \u2019 s deal , led Parliament to reject it by 230 votes in January and by 149 votes earlier in March . In the 29 March vote , May lost by only 58 votes . Before that vote , May promised that if her plan were approved , she \u2019 d resign . Despite her enormous unpopularity and clear failure as PM , even that wasn \u2019 t enough to get her bad deal passed .\nNow , she \u2019 s reportedly planning a fourth vote this week . May apparently believes that if she can get Parliament to vote on the same question enough times that she \u2019 ll eventually win approval of her deal .\nAnd she might . But the three votes that have already turned her deal down are decisive in one sense . They have already robbed any fourth \u2014 or fifth or whatever number vote \u2014 of legitimacy .\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow has tried to impose some parliamentary order on May \u2019 s continued votes . After the second vote , he ruled that another vote couldn \u2019 t be held unless the government \u2019 s motion was changed substantially . So May \u2019 s team made it different by chopping off half of it . The part that was voted down on Friday contained only the separation mechanism and left out entirely the provisions governing future relations between the UK and the EU . It was , as several critics said , a truly \u201c blind Brexit. \u201d No wonder it failed to gain Parliament \u2019 s approval .\nIn the UK \u2019 s system , the prime minister \u2019 s government \u2014 not Parliament \u2013 usually controls Parliament \u2019 s agenda . It votes on what the PM submits to it . Not anymore , at least on Brexit . Parliament has seized control of its own agenda and is making as much of a mess of it as May has .\nIn eight \u201c indicative \u201d votes last week , Parliament turned down every sensible alternative to May \u2019 s deal . Among the ones rejected are : leaving the EU without a deal ; adding a permanent \u201c customs union \u201d to May \u2019 s deal , and adoption of a soft Brexit modeled on Norway \u2019 s complicated quasi-membership in the EU . Others that were rejected include holding a second Brexit referendum in the UK and canceling the Article 50 notice that the UK is quitting the EU .\nThe EU consented to move Brexit Day from 29 March 29 to April 12 , presuming May \u2019 s deal is passed by then . If it isn \u2019 t , Brexit Day will be May 22 , supposedly avoiding the necessity of UK candidates running in the coming EU elections . But if May and the EU agree on more delays , the UK will have to run elections for representation to an organization it \u2019 s supposedly quitting .\nBy those actions , the UK Parliament has stuck its head in the sand , refusing to take any responsibility for the wreck of the HMS Brexit . Why should they when Theresa May is willing to serve as the UK \u2019 s chief javelin catcher until the Brexit mess is over ?\nThe only sensible outcome for the UK is a no-deal Brexit . That would free it up to negotiate trade agreements with any nation , which it can \u2019 t do as an EU member or as a member of a customs union with the EU . It would leave the issue of trade between the UK and the EU to the reasonable rules of the World Trade Organization .\nBut the Irish on both sides of the border \u2014 May \u2019 s ally , the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland , and the Irish Republic \u2014 are both unwilling to risk uncertainty of controls on the border between them .\nTime is the greatest limiting factor now . May won \u2019 t resign and isn \u2019 t susceptible to another intra-party \u201c no confidence \u201d motion until December . If she did resign , it \u2019 s very unlikely that the Conservative Party she supposedly leads would come up with a new leader before the May 22 Brexit date . Even if she called another snap general election , it can \u2019 t be held by then . Angry Tories have reportedly told her they \u2019 d block a snap election .\nThe most likely outcomes are the worst .
