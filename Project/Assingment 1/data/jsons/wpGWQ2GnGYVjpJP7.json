    "content": "Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of downtown Hong Kong on Sunday , defying social distancing protocols to protest Beijing \u2019 s announcement of a sweeping new national security law that could unravel many of the civil liberties residents enjoy in the semi-autonomous region of China .\nPolice used water cannons , tear gas , and pepper spray to disperse protesters , and there were reports of protesters throwing objects like plastic bottles and umbrellas at the police . At least 120 people were arrested .\nThe protest \u2014 the largest in the territory since the spread of coronavirus-caused lockdowns across China \u2014 reflects an intensification of longstanding tensions between pro-democracy protesters and the Chinese government at a critical political moment in the region .\nThe demonstrations came as Beijing has announced plans to bring Hong Kong further under its control using a forthcoming national security law \u2014 one experts say could be used to quash dissent and end many liberties Hongkongers have that those living in mainland China do not , like freedom of the press .\nThe ruling Communist Party has long endeavored to bring Hong Kong more fully under its control , and has signaled it would prefer not to wait until 2047 \u2014 when the city \u2019 s special status expires \u2014 to do so . In light of the local government \u2019 s failure to pass legislation giving the national government that control , it now appears Beijing is taking matters into its own hands , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Jen Kirby has explained \u2014 and that it is moving to bring a lively protest movement that gained serious momentum in 2019 to heel .\nMembers of the protest movement \u2014 which had a major success in defeating pro-Beijing legislation in 2019 \u2014 returned to the streets Sunday , hoping to pressure local officials into taking a stand against the new national security law .\nDespite not being given official authorization by the government , and social distancing restrictions banning gatherings of more than eight people , several thousand demonstrators gathered in the shopping district of Causeway Bay , alongside heavy police presence . There , they reportedly chanted many slogans , including \u201c Fight for freedom , Stand with Hong Kong , \u201d \u201c Revolution of our time . Liberate Hong Kong , \u201d and \u201c Hong Kong independence , the only way out. \u201d Some of them displayed blue , pro-independence flags .\nBut the Guardian reports the atmosphere was unusually strained : \u201c In contrast to marches and rallies last year , demonstrators had been visibly tense in anticipation of a harsh police crackdown . \u201d\nAnd a crackdown did indeed come . According to CNN , when challenged by law enforcement officials , some protesters claimed the gathering was an authorized \u201c health talk , \u201d but the police were unpersuaded , and quickly declared the protests illegal . When crowds began peacefully marching up Hennessy Road , police shot tear gas at them .\nDespite this resistance from the police and the arrests that followed , many protesters said the demonstration was worth the risk , arguing that Hong Kong \u2019 s semi-autonomous status is in serious jeopardy .\n\u201c I witnessed several decades of the Chinese Communist party \u2019 s misdeeds , I escaped to Hong Kong [ from mainland China ] 40 years ago , \u201d a 75-year-old protester who called himself Mr. Hui , told the Guardian . \u201c Now they have completely ruined Hong Kong . I am here to protect my home . We \u2019 re the real patriots , not the Communist party . \u201d\nThis law means Hong Kong could look very different soon\nThe National People \u2019 s Congress announced a forthcoming national security law on Thursday . According to CNN , the law is expected to \u201c ban sedition , secession and subversion against Beijing \u201d and will for the first time allow mainland Chinese national security agencies to deploy in Hong Kong . Notably , the law is expected to pass through \u201c a rarely used constitutional method \u201d that circumvents Hong Kong \u2019 s government altogether .\nExperts say Beijing \u2019 s new policy could deal a lethal blow to the \u201c one country , two systems \u201d rule under which Hong Kong has operated since the British returned the city to China in 1997 . The rule has allowed Hong Kong certain liberties , like a greater right to free expression and an independent judiciary , not extended to most of China \u2019 s population .\nDennis Kwok , a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong , said China \u2019 s new national security law would spell \u201c the end of \u2018 one country , two systems . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c It is an official death sentence for Hong Kong ; it \u2019 s nothing less than that , \u201d Alvin Y. H. Cheung , an affiliated scholar at NYU \u2019 s US-Asia Law Institute , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this week .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Jen Kirby has explained , the law \u2019 s approval could have a number of effects on Chinese political life :\nThe law could have the chilling effect on dissent that China desires , snuffing out all but the most extreme protests . The opposite also seems possible : that China \u2019 s actions \u2014 proof positive of why many Hongkongers felt they had to continue to protest \u2014 might escalate tensions even more . Hong Kong had already been divided between two camps : \u201c blue \u201d ( those who support the police ) and \u201c yellow \u201d ( those who support the protesters ) . But many of those \u201c yellow \u201d backers disagreed with some of the Hong Kong protesters \u2019 more radical tactics , like storming the Legislative Council or occupying a university campus . But China \u2019 s incursions may make it harder for pro-democracy Hongkongers to advocate for a more moderate stance . \u201c They will eventually be pushed to become either totally pro-Beijing agenda or pro-confrontational protesters , \u201d [ Ho-Fung ] Hung , [ professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins ] , noted . \u201c It \u2019 s the disappearance of the middle ground and really will become more polarized . \u201d\nBeijing has made it clear it hopes the law will indeed end the protests . But Sunday \u2019 s demonstration suggests the movement may not dissolve as quickly as party officials might hope .\nThe movement gained strength during Hong Kong \u2019 s 2019 demonstrations that began in opposition to a controversial extradition bill , which would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China . Over time , however , the demonstrations evolved into a broader call for greater political freedoms in the city , such as universal suffrage to elect Hong Kong \u2019 s leaders .\nThose protests occurred regularly and sometimes were massive \u2014 at their height , they involved millions of demonstrators . And while largely peaceful , they became increasingly violent over time . The protests garnered international attention , and managed to convince Hong Kong \u2019 s legislature to formally scrap the extradition bill that kicked off the unrest .\nNow it appears Beijing hopes to avoid local political considerations and use the power of the national government to both reshape its relationship to Hong Kong and fundamentally change the landscape of dissent in the territory .\nChina \u2019 s government has defended the new national security law as necessary , saying protests last year posed a national security threat to the country . On Sunday China \u2019 s foreign minister , Wang Yi , said the law should pass \u201c without the slightest delay , \u201d and promised it would be used to crack down on a \u201c very narrow category \u201d of acts , not any anti-government dissent .\nBut many experts and critics outside of China see the law as a way to justify broad crackdowns , and as a blatant power grab by Beijing .\nAnd the Trump administration has condemned the announcement of the law in strong terms .\n\u201c The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal , abide by its international obligations , and respect Hong Kong \u2019 s high degree of autonomy , democratic institutions , and civil liberties , which are key to preserving its special status under US law , \u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Friday .\nThat special status is now governed by the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , which was approved by Trump in 2019 . According to the act , the State Department needs to certify at least once a year that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy from mainland China to maintain its special trading partner status with the US .\nTrump \u2019 s national security adviser Robert O \u2019 Brien said Sunday on Meet the Press that certification is now in danger \u2014 and that it is likely \u201c there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China \u201d if the law passes .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .
