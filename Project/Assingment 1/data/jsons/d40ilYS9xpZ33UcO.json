Gen. Qassim Suleimani , Iran \u2019 s most important commander , saying that he was planning attacks on American targets , although the administration has offered few details .\nAlready that decision has led to a host of unintended consequences , including the sending of thousands more United States troops to the Middle East to defend American assets and interests that Mr. Trump only a few months ago suggested are not worth defending .\nHis answer to that contradiction seems to be to ask NATO to do the job . Presumably he wants allied forces to patrol the Persian Gulf at a time that tanker companies are halting their shipments across the Strait of Hormuz and airlines are avoiding Iraqi and Iranian airspace .\nIt seems unlikely they will heed his call .
