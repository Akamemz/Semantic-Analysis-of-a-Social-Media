Security Council briefing called late Wednesday to discuss the situation . However , Russia and China -- consistent allies of the Syrian government -- reportedly blocked a formal resolution .\nHours after the closed-door meeting , French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told CNN affiliate BFMTV that `` a reaction of force must be taken '' if the allegations are true .\n`` If the U.N. Security Council can not do it , decisions will be made otherwise , '' Fabius said .
