Even small changes in the criteria could have far-reaching effects : When the DNC set its thresholds at 65,000 donors or 1 percent in polls earlier this year , 20 candidates made the stage .\nBut merely increasing the polling threshold to 2 percent in four DNC-approved surveys , and doubling the donor threshold , capped the September debate at one night . Even a modest increase for November could spell the end of several campaigns that are just hanging on to the debate stage , and while we know the criteria are likely to keep going up , no one knows exactly how it will affect the 2020 field .
