    "content": "Representative Charlie Rangel ( D-NY ) recently expressed his puzzlement over the conservative wing of the Republican Party . In between incoherent ramblings and fragmented sentences , the congressman explained that the tea party is a \u201c cult \u201d group that suffers from an apparent \u201c illness \u201d .\n\u201c Politics is ( sic ) changing for me at this late age , to have to deal with a cult-type of group of people , \u201d said the man who recently allocated millions of taxpayer dollars to a New York library named in his honor . ( Maybe he \u2019 s speaking out of jealousy ? )\n\u201c When a handful of people [ I assume he is referring to the tea party coalition in the House of Representatives ] can control a larger number of people , to repeal a law that has been passed by the House , the Senate , and declared constitutional by the courts - and they campaign on the issue that it should be repealed- this is past Civics 101 . This is illness , \u201d said the Congressman who has inexplicably remained in office since 1971 . ( Whoa\u2026Talk about mental illness ! )\nWatch the video of the congressman taking a stab at coherent political dialogue :\nWell , Mr. Rangel , since you brought it up , maybe we should discuss a little about Civics 101 : Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate , judged by the Supreme Court to be a massive tax increase rather than a mandate for commercial engagement , was ruled Constitutional ( hat tip to John Roberts ) \u2026 But there are many other legal challenges pending against the 2,700 page bill and the tens of thousands of regulations that have yet to be fully implemented . Oh\u2026 And \u201c Constitutional \u201d does not mean \u201c good \u201d or \u201c well-advised \u201d . Regardless of a few Supreme Court rulings , Obamacare remains a burden on economic vitality and individual liberty .\nOf course Rangel \u2019 s a congressman\u2026 So we clearly can \u2019 t expect him to grasp American politics with any degree of adequacy . In addition to stumbling over a butchered sense of civics and constitutional law , the honorary * congressman ( * I \u2019 m assuming no-one votes for this guy on purpose ) took a couple of shots at the tea party .\nApparently the tea party is a \u201c cult \u201d \u2026 I always thought of it more as a collection of like-minded individuals who have banded together ( almost like a \u201c party \u201d of some sort ) for political clout\u2026 Ya know , like the Democrat party , the progressive movement , the Republican Party , the Communist Party , the Libertarian Party , the conservative movement , the constitutional movement , or for that matter any other faction of American political ideology in the last 200 years . I mean , heck , it \u2019 s not as if the tea party has routinely re-elected a man who used taxpayer funds to build a conference center , public service center or library in his own honor ( Ahem * Rangel * ahem ) . Now that would be cult-like .\nThen there \u2019 s Rangel \u2019 s laughable assertion that repealing laws is an illness ; a statement that deserves a prominent spot on the liberal-lunacy highlight reel of 2013 . I \u2019 m willing to bet there were plenty of Jim Crow era laws that deserved repeal . And I find it hard to believe that most of America was mentally ill when it decided to repeal the 18th Amendment , thus ending prohibition .\nIn fact , if mental illness is to be judged by traditional metrics , the case could be made that supporters of Obamacare are the ones suffering in today \u2019 s political climate . How else can it be explained that they think handing healthcare over to the same folks who run the DMV , the IRS , and the Social Security Administration will somehow improve things for average citizens ? I mean , it \u2019 s not as if the government has excelled at everything else it attempts to regulate into perfection . ( Education , finance , mortgages , student loans , retirement assistance , etc\u2026 Do we need to continue with this list ? )\nWhile the most recent utterances from one of America \u2019 s career-congressman are relatively inconsequential ( much like his censure for ethics violations ) , they illustrate a growing trend in American politics : The belief that small government advocates are radical , dangerous , and mutinous to government action .\nWell , the same thing was said about small-government advocates in the 18th century\u2026 So , I guess Rangel is putting the tea party in good company . The self-obsessed ( and ethically challenged ) New York Democrat might have just given the tea party quite the compliment .
