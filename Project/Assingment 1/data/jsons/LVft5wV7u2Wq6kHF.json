At home , he blasted Washington for partisan gridlock on fiscal issues .\n`` We are and have become a dysfunctional government that even our own people snicker , laugh at , ignore and are disgusted by , '' he said , adding there was a time when developing democracies wanted to emulate America 's government , but that is no longer the case .\nOn international affairs , the governor referenced issues in Syria , Russia and Iran as three foreign policy areas in which the Obama administration has failed to show strength and credibility .\nHe said America `` is no longer sending clear signals to the world - consistent signals . ''\n`` Signals like the ones Ronald Reagan sent when he was president as to who our friends are and that we will stand with them without doubt , and to who our enemies are , who we will oppose regardless of the cost , '' he continued .\nChristie 's remarks solidify his stance on national security issues as the Republican Party is knee-deep in an ideological fight over foreign policy . That debate has perhaps played out most visibly between Christie and another potential 2016 contender , Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , who 's trying to woo the broader Republican base with his libertarian-leaning , non-interventionist views .\nChristie 's speech was widely anticipated in the Jewish community because the last time Christie appeared before a Jewish audience , he made a major blunder by referring to the `` occupied territories , '' a term Israel and its allies do n't use .\nMany Israelis do n't consider the territories to be occupied , but rather say Israel has a legitimate claim to the land . Palestinians , along with the United Nations , consider the West Bank to be Palestinian but under military occupation by Israel .\nIn a private meeting later with Adelson , the GOP donor , Christie said he `` misspoke '' and that he did n't believe the West Bank is `` occupied '' by Israel . While Christie did n't mention Israel in his speech Sunday , he made it clear that the United States should more overtly align with its allies , and he singled out Iran as a `` terrorist state '' with nuclear capability .",
