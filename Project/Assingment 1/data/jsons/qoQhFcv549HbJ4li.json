''\nTrump 's comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S. , which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime . Hours before Trump 's comments , a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence 's upcoming trip to the region later this week .\nVenezuela 's defense minister called Trump 's talk of a military intervention an act of `` craziness '' and `` supreme extremism .
