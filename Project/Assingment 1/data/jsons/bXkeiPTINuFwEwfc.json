    "content": "The bitter Senate race in deeply conservative Alabama went to the voters Tuesday as they chose between an embattled but well-known Republican accused of child molestation and a Democrat who hopes to break the GOP 's lock on the state and uphold `` decency . ''\nRoy Moore , the 70-year-old GOP nominee who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice after flouting federal law , was attempting another political resurrection amid accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s .\nDemocrat Doug Jones , 63 , is best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen who killed four black girls in a 1963 church bombing .\nThe winner will take the seat previously held by Jeff Sessions , who resigned to become attorney general . Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 Senate majority . And a routine election in Republican-dominated Alabama would not normally be expected to alter that balance because the state has not sent a Democrat to the upper chamber of Congress since 1992 . But the allegations against Moore created doubt about the outcome .\nAlthough the race has commanded intense national attention for weeks , it was not likely to draw large numbers of people to the polls . Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill predicted that turnout would not exceed 25 percent of registered voters and could be as low as 18 percent .\nTeresa Brown , a 53-year-old administrative assistant at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , said she 's voting for Jones .\n`` We do n't need a pedophile in there , '' said Brown , who was among more than two dozen people in line in the chilly morning air at Legion Field , a predominantly black precinct in Birmingham .\n`` We need someone that 's going to represent the state of Alabama , work across party lines ... just be there for all the people , not just a select few of the people . ''\nAl Bright , 63 , who does refrigeration repair , voted for Moore .\n`` I just believe regardless of the allegations against him , I believe he is an honorable man , '' Bright said .\nBright said he realized that Moore was removed from office because of actions he took to try to block same-sex marriage in the state .\n`` I do n't think there 's anything wrong with that because I believe in that as well , '' he said . `` I feel the same \u2014 marriage is between a man and a woman .
