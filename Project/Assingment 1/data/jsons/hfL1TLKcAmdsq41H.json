Bickel/The Columbus Dispatch via AP , File )\nWhile many Americans are filled with fear , Melissa Ackison says the coronavirus pandemic has filled her with anger . The stay-at-home orders are government overreach , the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says , and the labeling of some workers as \u201c essential \u201d arbitrary .\n\u201c It enrages something inside of you , \u201d said Ackison , who was among those who protested Republican Gov . Mike DeWine \u2019 s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son . She has \u201c no fear whatsoever \u201d of contracting the virus , she said Thursday , dismissing it as hype .\nThe Ohio protest was among a growing number staged outside governors \u2019 mansions and state Capitols across the country . In places like Oklahoma , Texas and Virginia , small-government groups , supporters of President Donald Trump , anti-vaccine advocates , gun rights backers and supporters of right-wing causes have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus . As their frustration with life under lockdown grows , they \u2019 ve started to openly defy the social distancing rules in an effort to put pressure on governors to ease them .\nSome of the protests have been small events , promoted via Facebook groups that have popped up in recent days and whose organizers are sometimes difficult to identify . Others are backed by groups funded by prominent Republican donors , some with ties to Trump . The largest so far , a rally of thousands that jammed the streets of Lansing , Michigan , on Wednesday , looked much like one of the president \u2019 s rallies \u2014 complete with MAGA hats or Trump flags \u2014 or one of the tea party rallies from a decade ago .\nThe signs of frustration come as Trump has pushed for easing stay-at-home orders and tried to look ahead to restarting the economy . He unveiled a framework for governors to follow on Thursday , but acknowledged the governors will have the final say on when their state is ready . Health experts have warned that lifting restrictions too quickly could result in a surge of new cases of the virus .\nBut the president and some of his supporters are impatient . Thousands of people in their cars packed the streets of Lansing to protest Democratic Gov . Gretchen Whitmer \u2019 s stay-at-home order and other restrictions . Outside the Capitol , some chanted \u201c Lock her up , \u201d a throwback to Trump \u2019 s calls during the 2016 election about his rival Hillary Clinton . One woman held a sign reading \u201c Heil Witmer . \u201d\nAsked about the protesters , Trump on Thursday expressed sympathy with their frustration \u2014 \u201c They \u2019 re suffering ... they want to get back \u201d \u2014 and dismissed concerns about the health risks of ignoring state orders and potentially exposing themselves to the virus .\n\u201c I think they \u2019 re listening . I think they listen to me , \u201d he said . \u201c They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion , and my opinion \u2019 s the same as just about all of the governors . Nobody wants to stay shut . \u201d\nOn Friday , he egged the protesters on , tweeting for supporters to \u201c LIBERATE \u201d three states with Democratic governors : Michigan , Virginia and Minnesota , where a an afternoon protest was being held outside the governor \u2019 s residence .\nPolls show the protesters \u2019 views are not widely held . An AP-NORC survey earlier this month found large majorities of Americans support a long list of government restrictions , including closing schools , limiting gatherings and shuttering bars and restaurants . Three-quarters of Americans backed requiring people to stay in their homes . And majorities of both Democrats and Republicans gave high marks for the state and city governments .\nBut the protests expose resilient partisan divisions , particularly in battleground Michigan . The protest there was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition , a group founded by a pro-Trump state representative and his wife , Meshawn Maddock , who is on the advisory board for an official Trump campaign group called \u201c Women for Trump \u201d and is also the co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans .\nAnother group that promoted the event , the Michigan Freedom Fund , is run by Greg McNeilly , a longtime political adviser to the DeVos family , who are prolific Republican donors and have funded conservative causes across the state for decades . McNeilly was campaign manager for Dick DeVos , the husband of current U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , during his failed bid for governor in 2006 .\nWhitmer was among the governors who expressed concern about the gatherings , saying it put people at risk and could have prolonged the shutdown . Michigan had recorded over 2,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Thursday , and close to 30,000 confirmed cases of people infected with the virus . Roughly one-quarter of the state \u2019 s workforce has filed for unemployment .\nBut it \u2019 s not just Democratic governors feeling the heat . A procession of cars swarmed around the Republican-dominated statehouse in Oklahoma City on Wednesday , with messages written on windows or signs that said \u201c stop killing our economy , \u201d \u201c we need our church \u201d and \u201c time 2 work . \u201d\nCarol Hefner , who previously served as an Oklahoma co-chair of Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign , was a major organizer of the event .

A protest Thursday in the Texas capital of Austin , where protesters chanted \u201c Free Texas \u201d and \u201c Make America Free Again , \u201d was broadcast live by InfoWars TV , part of a company owned by conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones .\nThe Ohio event earlier this week brought together a collection of anti-vaccine advocates , Second Amendment supporters , tea party activists and other anti-government activists .
