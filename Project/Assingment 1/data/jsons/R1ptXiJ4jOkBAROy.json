    "content": "Trump Ca n't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China . Here 's What He Can Do\nDonald Trump 's rhetoric on China and trade has been blunt , to say the least .\n`` We ca n't continue to allow China to rape our country \u2014 and that 's what they 're doing , '' he said at a May 2016 campaign rally . `` It 's the greatest theft in the history of the world . ''\nHis tone was a bit more measured leading up to his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , though the message was similar : The U.S. must be tough on China when it comes to trade .\n`` The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses , '' the president wrote across two tweets . Trump continued , `` American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives . ''\nTrump 's anti-trade rhetoric was great politics during the campaign . But the hard truth is that getting those jobs back from China just wo n't happen \u2014 indeed , China is n't primarily responsible for manufacturing job losses in recent years . But if Trump is concerned about the jobs lost to China , there are other steps he can take right now , some of which do n't at all involve negotiating with President Xi .\nWhat exactly has ( and has n't ) the U.S. lost to China ?\nThe U.S. has most definitely lost jobs to China . In perhaps the most commonly cited recent paper on the matter , a group of economists led by MIT 's David Autor found that between 1990 and 2007 , Chinese import competition accounted for the loss of 1 million manufacturing jobs \u2014 about 25 percent of the total manufacturing job loss over that period .\n( In fact , Trump may want to thank Xi for all his country 's exports ; those same economists plus Lund University 's Kaveh Majlesi found in a January paper that , all other things being equal , if `` the growth in Chinese import penetration had been 50 percent lower than the actual growth '' in Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania than it was between 2000 and 2016 , those states would have chosen Hillary Clinton , and she would have won the Electoral College . )\nIn addition , China has not lived up to a variety of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization , according to a January report from the U.S. trade representative 's office . In areas including intellectual property protections , the government 's favoring of state-owned enterprises and `` troubling agricultural policies that block U.S. market access , '' the USTR said the Chinese government could stand to improve .\n`` Is a country like China different , and is it more likely that they are \u2014 cheating is n't necessarily the right word , but \u2014 doing more of these kinds of things that are more worrisome than other countries ? '' said Chad Bown , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . `` And I think the answer to that is probably yes . ''\nSo there are reasons for concern regarding the U.S. trade relationship with China . But if China did indeed suck 25 percent of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S. over nearly two decades , that leaves about 75 percent of those jobs that were n't lost to China .\nWhat happened ? Automation is a huge factor here . U.S. factories simply grew more efficient over time . In fact , while the number of manufacturing jobs plummeted \u2014 manufacturing output nevertheless grew .\n`` I used to go out on an auto factory floor and it looks like Fifth Avenue in New York at Christmastime , '' said Carla Hills , who served as U.S. trade representative under George H.W . Bush . `` Today , you look at the floor and there are six people with long white smocks and buffers on their shoes . ''\nThere are a host of things that Trump might be able to do to improve the U.S. economy when it comes to trade with China . But let 's start with one thing he ca n't do :\nHe at one point threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on China 's goods . There are some big problems with that approach . One is that it simply would n't be that effective .\n`` That would bring some manufacturing production back to the U.S. , '' said Gordon Hanson , who co-wrote that study on U.S. jobs moving to China . `` But that 's not the same thing as manufacturing employment . The jobs that left were 20th century jobs . That is , they were jobs in factories that were built using older vintage technology that was more labor intensive than 21st century tech in which automation is more present . ''\nNot only that , but that could also have the pesky side effect of launching a trade war . Still , there 's plenty more that could be helpful to U.S. goods producers .\nRather than threaten massive tariffs , Trump could try to make the footing a little more equal for both U.S. and Chinese goods .\n`` There are a lot of industries in which you could make the case that China is violating existing trade rules , '' said Hanson . `` But the response to that is not an across-the-board tariff . The response is to go industry by industry and pick those things apart . ''\nThat could be a long ( but worthwhile ) process of filing complaints with the World Trade Organization . Still , a long string of nonsplashy administrative actions may not suit President Trump 's decidedly unsubtle governing style .\nChina trades with a lot of other places besides the U.S. , so the U.S. could band together with those places to put pressure on China to change its trade practices .\nAccording to Hanson , the U.S. could `` get together with the EU , get together with a bunch of WTO partners , document violations , and say , 'Look : if you do n't remove those subsidies , then we 're going to enact a series of retaliatory tariffs on other products . ' ``\nTrump loves to complain about the U.S. trade deficit with China . And it is indeed big \u2014 in 2016 , the U.S. imported $ 347 billion more than it exported to China , accounting for almost half of the total U.S. trade deficit with the world .\nTrade deficits are n't inherently bad , but if the U.S. does want to sell more goods to China , the Trump administration could try to negotiate China into being more open to U.S. products , says one expert .\n`` In general , China 's market access restrictions prevent the consumption of American goods and services , '' wrote the Brookings Institution 's David Dollar this week . He points to one example : `` In automobiles , a 25 percent import tariff plus domestic content rules in the past mean that American-brand cars sold in China have little U.S . content . '' Likewise , he said , China could be more open to U.S. agricultural and service industries .\nHowever , it does n't make sense to make too big a deal ( as Trump does ) out of any single trade deficit with any country .\n`` Bilateral trade deficits are not as relevant as your overall trade deficit , '' Hills said . `` I have a deficit with my grocery , and I have a surplus with my clients . But I ca n't have a surplus with my grocer . I have to buy from them . ''\nMainstream economists often say that trade is ultimately a net good ; it creates broad , albeit easy-to-ignore-in-everyday-life benefits , like cheaper goods and a wider variety of products . But it also comes with acute pain for those people who do lose jobs .\nThat same pain is felt by people who lose their jobs to robots , though , said Hills , and if the U.S. is serious about getting former manufacturing workers back to work , that means adopting policies outside of trade pacts .\n`` We could be criticized for not addressing , in my opinion , the policy of skill training for those who have lost their jobs to automation , and the majority of job losses have been as a result of automation , '' said Hills . `` But if you 're someone who lost their job \u2014 whether it 's a miner in West Virginia or on the floor of a Ford factory \u2014 you do n't really care if it 's automation or international competition . ''\nShe points to the transition from horses and buggies to cars .\n`` The question is , what do you do with the people who were driving the horses and the coaches ? '' she said . `` They do n't know how to drive cars . You 've got to send them to a skill center . ''\nBut then , there 's a related problem : Often when new jobs do pop up , they 're not near the people who need those jobs , Bown pointed out . There 's a related problem in the energy sector , as NPR 's Domenico Montanaro wrote last week : The lion 's share of the nation 's new solar jobs are n't exactly in coal country . That means there could be some sort of way to help people relocate to where the jobs are , Bown added .\nOf course , none of that kind of domestic policy will come up as Trump meets with Xi Jinping this week . Plenty of issues will be hanging over their heads \u2014 North Korea and missile defense , for example . One thing that wo n't be hanging over them : the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nBecause Trump scrapped the TPP , which had been in process for nearly a decade , the two leaders come to a table where the game board for trade has been overturned and reset . China was not a party to that deal , but the deal was written to allow the U.S. to hem China in on trade by setting stiff and transparent rules on trade in Asia .\nHowever imperfect the TPP was , Hanson said , the U.S. did give China a lot more trading power by giving up the deal .\n`` We just walked away from it and gave China carte blanche to dictate the way in which trade rules will be written in Asia for the next decade , '' Hanson said .",
