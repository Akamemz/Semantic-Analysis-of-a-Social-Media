He was speaking to those who were old enough to remember the Founders from their youth and those descendants of the Revolutionary generation .\nBut then Lincoln spoke about another set of Americans , the ones whose families came here after the great Revolution was over . In a word , immigrants . Of these , Lincoln said :\n\u201c If they look back through this history and trace their connection with those days by blood , they find they have none . They can not carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us , but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence , they find that those old men say that , \u2018 We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , \u2019 and then they feel that the moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men , that it is the father of all moral principle in them , and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood , and flesh of the flesh , of the men who wrote that Declaration , and so they are . \u201d\nAnd so we are . None of us fought at Bunker Hill or Lexington or Concord . None of us endured famine , cold , or the impact of a musket ball . None of us signed our names to a document that made us traitors , fit to be hung .\nYet , despite all that , we are still Americans , and the Fourth is still our celebration , because we hold dear the \u201c moral sentiment \u201d for which those iron men fought and died \u2014 \u201c That all men are created equal . \u201d\nLincoln reassures us that this alone is enough to form that \u201c historical connection \u201d with men who in all other things bear no relation to us .
