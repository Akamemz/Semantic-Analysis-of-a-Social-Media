    "content": "Friday during his show \u2019 s opening monologue , Fox News Channel \u2019 s Tucker Carlson warned the U.S. airstrike that resulted in the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani could lead the United States to a showdown against Iran .\nAccording to the \u201c Tucker Carlson Tonight \u201d host , such a war would defy the will of most Americans and contradict statements President Donald Trump made during his successful 2016 campaign . However , some in Washington have been championing a war against Iran and may continue to push the country in that direction , he explained .\nCARLSON : Yesterday , as you know , an American airstrike killed an Iranian general called Qasem Soleimani . For the past 21 years , Soleimani commanded the Quds Force , which is responsible for paramilitary operations outside the national borders of Iran . In that role , Soleimani was believed to be a patron of the Shia militias that regularly attacked American troops during the Iraq war . He was also a major player in Syria during their civil war , as well as in the campaign against ISIS . Though he was little known to the American public , Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran , and also among the most powerful \u2014 according to some accounts , second only to the supreme leader of that country .\nThe Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called \u201c forceful revenge \u201d against the United States , in response to his death . Now , whether that will happen , and what form it might take , remains to be seen . But it \u2019 s no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs , we could be engaged in a conflict \u2014 a real conflict \u2014 with Iran .\nFrom Iran \u2019 s perspective , we \u2019 re already there . If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff , for example , would you consider it an act of war ? You would . So what happened yesterday wasn \u2019 t just another symbolic bombing sortie , of the kind we \u2019 ve seen in Syria . It was a pivot point . Neocons in Washington understood that immediately .\n\u201c Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani , \u201d tweeted disgraced former National Security Advisor John Bolton . \u201c Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. \u201d End quote .\nThat , of course , has been the neocon objective all along . The president though has for years has opposed that objective . In a statement , he saidthat regime change and war aren \u2019 t the point at all .\nTRUMP : We took action last night to stop a war . We did not take action to start a war .\nWe do not seek regime change . However , the Iranian regime \u2019 s aggression in the region , including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors , must end , and it must end now .\nIf Americans anywhere are threatened , we have all of those targets already fully identified , and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary .\nCARLSON : According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , meanwhile , Soleimani was killed to forestall planned attacks on Americans . But as he later conceded , those attacks would have occurred in the Middle East , not here in America :\nPOMPEO : President Trump \u2019 s decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives . There \u2019 s no doubt about that . He was actively plotting in the region to take actions , a big action as he described it , that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk .\nAnd last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted .\nBERMAN : Was there any imminent threat to the U.S. homeland ?\nPOMPEO : These were threats that were located in the region .\nCARLSON : \u201c Threats in the region. \u201d If you don \u2019 t live in Washington , here \u2019 s a translation : That would be in hostile Middle Eastern countries , places where American troops would never be in the first place , were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot and John Bolton . But nevermind . No one in Washington is in the mood for big-picture questions right now , questions \u2014 the obvious ones like : Is Iran really the greatest threat we face ? And , who \u2019 s actually benefiting from this ? And , why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country , in favor of jumping into another quagmire , from which there \u2019 s no obvious exit ? If we \u2019 re still in Afghanistan 19 sad years later , what makes us think there \u2019 s a quick way out of Iran ? And so on . Nobody \u2019 s thinking like that right now .\nInstead , chest-beaters like Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska make the usual warlike noises \u2014 the ones they always make . \u201c This is very simple , \u201d Sasse wrote in a statement last night . \u201c General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans , \u201d which is essentially true . Soleimani was a bad guy . But does that make killing him , quote , \u201c very simple \u201d ? Of course not . Nothing about life , and certainly not about killing , is ever \u201c very simple. \u201d Any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or lying .\nYes , Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans . But Mexico and China are also linked to deaths of Americans . Each has flooded our country with narcotics , from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year .
