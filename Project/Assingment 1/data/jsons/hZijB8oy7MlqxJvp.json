    "content": "Last year , in May , when he announced a new partnership with Netflix , he revealed he and Michelle \u2019 s production company would be called Higher Ground . In July , just after Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki , Obama gave his most extensive public remarks , the annual Mandela Lecture , in Johannesburg , and his subject was the populist backlash to globalization , which he said , \u201c first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right. \u201d He never mentioned Trump by name .\nIn that speech , while cataloging the litany of authoritarian trends and making obvious references to the ways that he believes Trump has debased American politics , nonetheless his prescription was defined by anti-radicalism . He decried equally \u201c unregulated , unbridled , unethical capitalism \u201d and \u201c old-style command-and-control socialism \u201d in favor of traditional American liberalism , \u201c an inclusive market-based system. \u201d In case he wasn \u2019 t clear that populist demagoguery can come from either ideological direction , he added , \u201c So those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy , whether it \u2019 s on the left or the right , they make democracy unworkable . \u201d\nThis clinical detachment was on display the following day as well , when he hosted a town hall event for his foundation . Obama was asked by a young woman from Cameroon about how he decided on which political party to join . Obama \u2019 s answer was broad and sweeping in its view of America \u2019 s two parties and barely hinted at the common view among Democrats that the Republican Party under Trump is a radical outlier that should be vilified .\n\u201c In the United States , \u201d Obama said , speaking in the slow and deliberate style that was the basis for comics who mimicked him , \u201c there was a time where I might have been a Republican because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican . And at that time it was the Republican Party that was opposing the expansion of slavery in the United States . Today , it \u2019 s the Democratic Party that reflects the values that I spoke about at the Mandela Lecture yesterday . And that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that will always be the case . It doesn \u2019 t mean that in every instance I have agreed with the Democratic Party platform , but broadly speaking , when you look at who \u2019 s been concerned about broad-based economic growth , who \u2019 s been concerned about civil rights , who has been most supportive in making sure that women are treated fairly in the workplace , who \u2019 s supported collective bargaining , who has been most concerned with environmental issues , including climate change . Right now , that happens to be the Democratic Party . And again , that wasn \u2019 t always the case . There used to be more variation and different ideological views even within the parties so you might have more flexibility . \u201d\nThis odd tangent , delivered by someone with less impeccable progressive credentials , might be attacked from the left as a kind of false equivalence , a statement about the two parties that is so abstract that it drains the very real differences between them today . But one way to make sense of it , as well as his \u201c whether it \u2019 s on left or the right \u201d warning of the day before , is that Obama has come to see the threat to stability differently now : Although the peril is more acute today from the right , his own party needs to be on guard against an absolutism rising on the left , which also happens to be the source of the attacks on his own legacy .\nObama stayed away from campaign politics at the start of his post-presidency , but by the fall of 2018 , when a wave was building and hundreds of his former administration officials were running for office , he dove in headfirst , endorsing dozens of candidates , a group from across the country that he described in non-ideological terms as \u201c diverse , patriotic , and bighearted. \u201d He focused on races that would help Holder \u2019 s redistricting project and many swing areas where party leaders knew he would be an asset .\nAccording to several people close to him , his experience campaigning during 2018 made him even more convinced that Democrats had to be careful not to mistake the passion and excitement on Twitter for candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for where the public was ideologically , especially in the coming general election against Trump .\nA close family friend told me , \u201c Remember he ran to the right of Hillary in 2008 on a lot of issues , and because he happened to be young and new on the scene and he happened to be African American , people just assumed that he would be running as a community organizer . And the reality is , on many issues he was running equal to or to the right of her . His politics are not strong left of center . I mean it 's left , but he 's nowhere near where some of the candidates are currently sitting , at least when he got himself elected . \u201d\nA close Obama adviser added : \u201c There 's a whole big country out there , so don \u2019 t just go to a rally and everybody 's cheering and you think that that 's always the pulse of the country . Those are just the people who showed up to hear you . \u201d\nWhile Trump \u2019 s early assault on American political norms created a cottage industry of \u201c Where \u2019 s Obama ? \u201d outcry on the left , Obama \u2019 s own view , perhaps a bit self-serving , was that the more he became the face of his party , the less of a chance it allowed for new faces to emerge . And once the Democrats took over the House and the enormous Democratic presidential field began to emerge , the demands for him to weigh in on everything receded . These days when his staff brings him ideas , issues , outrages that he might address , Obama always asks a simple question , \u201c To what end ? \u201d More often than not , he stays mum .\nAnd then Joe Biden announced he would run for president . Presidents have always struggled with how much to support their vice presidents . At one level , a Biden win would be a profound vindication , an almost direct restoration of the Obama administration . But Obama had already passed over Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2016 . With Biden out of the race in 2020 , the psychodrama of their relationship and the intrigue about Obama \u2019 s assessment of Biden could have been avoided . Obama \u2019 s commitment to non-interference would have seemed less fraught .\nBiden , Obama told people close to him before Biden even entered the race , would have to \u201c earn \u201d it . There would be no endorsement . ( Biden has said he never asked for one . ) Besides , he liked to say , fighting it out in a tough primary is what made Obama a strong candidate for the general election .\nLast year , Obama let it be widely known that he would not make his preference known or , in the phrase that his close advisers frequently use , \u201c put his thumb on the scale. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t just Biden who was disappointed . Holder was particularly wounded that his close friend wasn \u2019 t more encouraging of his own ambitions . \u201d He \u2019 s still pretty sensitive about it , \u201d said someone close to Holder . \u201c He was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run . Holder couldn \u2019 t get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people . Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldn \u2019 t get in . So that frustrated Holder . It blocked him . And Biden has turned out the way they all feared , and that \u2019 s really frustrating to Eric . \u201d\nOver the past year , Obama and his closest advisers were clinical in their assessments of the candidates . They discussed doubts about Kamala Harris \u2019 appeal to African Americans . Obama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg . During their West End meeting , he was complimentary about Steve Bullock \u2019 s record as a governor and frank about his challenges : \u201c Nobody knows who you are , \u201d he told him .\nWhen it comes to Sanders , I asked one close adviser whether Obama would really lay himself on the line to prevent a Sanders nomination . \u201c I can \u2019 t really confirm that , \u201d the adviser said . \u201c He hasn \u2019 t said that directly to me . The only reason I 'm hesitating at all is because , yeah , if Bernie were running away with it , I think maybe we would all have to say something . But I do n't think that 's likely . It 's not happening. \u201d ( Another close Obama friend said , \u201c Bernie 's not a Democrat . \u201d )\nAs for Warren , the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama , Obama \u2019 s relationship with Warren is famously complicated . Back in early 2015 , when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives , Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him\u2014a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate . There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren \u2019 s campaign .",
