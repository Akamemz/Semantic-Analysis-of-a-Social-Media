    "content": "President Obama found himself weathering bipartisan broadsides Wednesday as he sent Congress his 2014 budget proposal , which in its effort to please both sides of the aisle has ended up angering both .\nThe budget arrived on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning , delivered 65 days after the legal deadline . The $ 3.77 trillion spending plan , which is over 2,000 pages , tries to curb deficits by further raising taxes on top earners and reining in the growth of Social Security .\nObama called his plan `` a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle class jobs and growth , '' during remarks he made Wednesday morning in the White House Rose Garden .\n`` If you 're serious about deficit reduction , then there 's no excuse to keep these loopholes open , '' he said .\nHe also said he 's `` already met Republicans more than half way . ''\nBut Republicans argue they already consented to increased taxes as part of the fiscal crisis deal and have expressed little interest in negotiating another hike . And liberal Democrats -- particularly powerful advocacy groups -- have launched a series of campaigns to oppose the changes to Social Security .\nThe president 's proposal being unveiled Wednesday includes an additional $ 1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade , bringing total deficit savings to $ 4.3 trillion , based on the administration 's calculations . It projects that the deficit for the 2014 budget year , which begins Oct. 1 , would fall to $ 744 billion . That would be the lowest gap between spending and revenue since 2008 .\nThe president 's plan tracks an offer he made to House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , during December 's budget negotiations , which Boehner ended up walking away from because of his opposition to higher taxes on the wealthy .\nThe Obama budget proposal will join competing budget outlines already approved by the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate .\nThe most sweeping proposal in Obama 's budget is a switch in the way the government calculates the annual cost-of-living adjustments for the millions of recipients of Social Security and other government benefit programs . The current method of measuring increases in the consumer price index would be modified to track a process known as chained CPI .\nThe new method takes into account changes that occur when people substitute goods rising in price with less expensive products . It results in slightly lower annual reading for inflation .\nThe switch in the inflation formula would cut spending on government benefit programs by $ 130 billion over 10 years , although the administration said it planned to protect the most vulnerable , including the very elderly . The change would also raise about $ 100 billion in higher taxes because the current CPI formula is used to adjust tax brackets each year . A lower inflation measure would mean more money taxed at higher rates .\nIn the tax area , Obama would raise an additional $ 580 billion by restricting deductions for the top 2 percent of family incomes . The budget would also implement the `` Buffett Rule '' requiring that households with incomes of more than $ 1 million pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes . Charitable giving would be excluded .\nObama 's plan is not all about budget cuts . It also includes an additional $ 50 billion to fund infrastructure investments , including $ 40 billion in a `` Fix It First '' effort to provide immediate investments to repair highways , bridges , transit systems and airports nationwide .\nObama 's budget would also provide $ 1 billion to launch a network of 15 manufacturing innovation institutes across the country , and it earmarks funding to support high-speed rail projects .\nThe president also is proposing establishment of program to offer preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families , with the money to support the effort coming from increased taxes on tobacco products .\nThe administration said its proposals to increase spending would not increase the deficit but rather are paid for either by increasing taxes or making deeper cuts to other programs .\nAmong the proposed cuts , the administration wants to trim defense spending by an additional $ 100 billion and domestic programs by an extra $ 100 billion over the next decade .\nThe budget proposes cutting $ 400 billion from Medicare and other health care programs over a decade . The cuts would come in a variety of ways , including negotiating better prescription drug prices and asking wealthy seniors to pay more .\nIt would obtain an additional $ 200 billion in savings by scaling back farm subsidies and trimming federal retiree programs .\nCongress and the administration have already secured $ 2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years through budget reductions and with the end-of-year tax increase on the rich . Obama 's plan would bring that total to $ 4.3 trillion over 10 years .\nIt is unlikely that Congress will get down to serious budget negotiations until this summer , when the government once again will be confronted with the need to raise the government 's borrowing limit or face the prospect of a first-ever default on U.S. debt .\nAs part of the administration 's effort to win over Republicans , Obama will have a private dinner at the White House with about a dozen GOP senators Wednesday night .
