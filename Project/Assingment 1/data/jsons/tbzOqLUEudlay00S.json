    "content": "Reddit has suffered a rocky year , having weathered months of censorship concerns and subreddit shutdowns . Recent revelations that co-founder and current CEO Steve Huffman was surreptitiously editing Reddit posts critical of him have thrown the community into still more chaos . But Reddit is far from the only social network struggling with the tension between speech and sensitivity . Similar snafus at other services have been dominating recent headlines : there 's `` fake news '' on Facebook , `` hate speech '' on Twitter , and the continued scourge of rude comment sections .\nSocial-media platforms are finding it harder to mouth free speech platitudes ( and enjoy the corresponding cultural benefits ) while at the same time actively curating a sanitized media feed . Yet to not curate or censor is to be accused of aiding and abetting a parade of horribles ranging from online jihadis to the `` alt-right . ''\nThe so-called `` Reddit Revolt '' has pitted a coterie of left-leaning `` social justice warriors '' against a ragtag , right-leaning , and rambunctious crew who call themselves free-speech activists . Tensions between Reddit administrators and certain subreddits\u2014most notably , the pro-Trump subreddit called r/The_Donald and a now-banned conspiracy theory subreddit called r/pizzagate that believes high-level world leaders operate and patronize international child-trafficking rings\u2014have been high over the past year , as these communities ' impolitic and often impolite content raised the hackles of the website 's generally more liberal operators . Where Huffman , or u/spez as he is known on Reddit , really crossed a line with certain Redditors is when he admitted to amending user comments that were critical of him to appear like they were criticizing moderators of r/The_Donald instead . While some have been able to forgive Huffman 's faux pas as an immature but benign troll against a community that constantly causes problems , others have decided to leave the platform all together in search of more censorship-averse websites .\nOf course , internet companies like Reddit and Twitter are private corporations that can run their businesses however they see fit . If that includes censorship , so be it . Users are free to seek or build a better alternative\u2014as users of the still relatively-obscure Voat or Gab platforms have\u2014or just stop using the service altogether .\nYet a social network is only as valuable as , well , its network . If everyone you know insists on using a certain service , you 're probably going to use that one , too . Even if you do n't personally use a particular network , if enough people in a country or planet do use it , then its policies and priorities could have a major impact on your life .\nAnd then there 's the value of `` free speech '' on a conceptual level . If you hold free speech to be an ideal worth fighting for , you will push platforms to protect it , even if it is costly or inconvenient .\nThis is a conundrum that we did n't have to seriously deal with for a long time . In their early days , social-media platforms were `` open '' merely by virtue of their limited scale . Far fewer people used these websites , and the early adopters who did were largely internet-hardened veterans of forums and IRC channels who were not exactly allergic to a good flame war .\nFor years , social media platforms touted this openness as a key cultural and design feature of their services . Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo famously characterized the microblogging platform as `` the free speech wing of the free speech party . '' Mark Zuckerberg marketed Facebook as a `` place where people across the world share their views and ideas . '' And of course Reddit has long positioned itself as a `` free speech site with very few exceptions '' \u2014even when said speech was personally revolting to its operators . Only criminal acts , `` doxing , '' IP violations , and perhaps targeted harassment were grounds for platform intervention\u2014and even then , in a limited fashion .

Our future was no longer shaped primarily by `` conflict or great men , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman .
