(Reuters photo: James Lawler Duggan)\n\nToday\u2019s March for Life sends a strong message.\n\nToday, tens of thousands of Americans have traveled to Washington, D.C., for the 45th annual March for Life. They come from all across our nation, and from every walk of life \u2013 students of every age, blue-collar workers, people of many backgrounds, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.\n\nYet no matter their story, today they will join hands and hearts on the National Mall, and with one voice they will call on the United States of America to rededicate itself to the most fundamental right enshrined in our Declaration of Independence \u2013 the unalienable right to life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks to their courage, and thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, life is winning in America again.\n\nThis year, President Trump will personally address the March for Life from the Rose Garden of the White House \u2013 something no president has ever done. It is fitting that he is the first to take such a historic step, because since the outset of this administration, we\u2019ve taken historic action to protect the most vulnerable in our society.\n\nIn one of his very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, to prevent American foreign aid from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions. Our administration has also broadened this policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve stopped U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, so American taxpayers won\u2019t have to support abortion in such countries as China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve reversed the last administration\u2019s policy and empowered states to defund Planned Parenthood and devote those resources to women\u2019s-health providers.

It\u2019s winning because of the policies of our administration, and because of the commitment and compassion of those who gather today in our nation\u2019s capital, and in marches, meetings, and homes all across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLife is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLife is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need.\n\nLife is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis-pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who bring comfort and care to women, in cities and towns across this country.\n\nAnd life is winning through the quiet counsel between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee on college campuses, where the truth is being told, and hope is defeating despair.\n\nWhen President Trump addresses the March for Life, it will mark the unprecedented progress we have made in the cause of life.
