    "content": "There are a lot of surprising things about Donald Trump 's campaign . He has been atop polls almost constantly for nearly five months . Contrast that to GOP primaries of recent past , in which a series of `` front-runners '' have come and gone before a nominee was chosen .\nLikewise , he seems not only immune to fact checks but is helped when he is perceived to be a victim of media targeting \u2014 even when he has made blatantly untrue claims and refused to back down .\nWednesday provided the latest Trump news that shocked ( shocked ! ) many : Nearly two-thirds of likely GOP primary voters said in a Bloomberg poll that they supported his proposal to block all Muslims from entering the U.S. \u2014 a proposal that many legal scholars say would be unconstitutional and that many of Trump 's GOP opponents blast as `` un-American . ''\nBut when you look at Americans ' attitudes , not only on that specific question of Islam but toward politics in general , a lot of things that have surprised the political establishment about Trump are n't surprising at all .\nLet 's start with that Bloomberg poll . One important caveat of this poll is that it 's primary voters , not all GOP voters . Conventional wisdom says that primary voters ( of either party ) tend to have more extreme views than voters writ large , but they are who pick a nominee .\nIt 's true that Americans view Muslims more negatively than they do any other major religious group , as Pew found in a 2014 study . On a `` feelings thermometer '' of 0 ( most `` cold '' or negative ) to 100 , Muslims scored a 40 , on par with atheists ' 41 .
