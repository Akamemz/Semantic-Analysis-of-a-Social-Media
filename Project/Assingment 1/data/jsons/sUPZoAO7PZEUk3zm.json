    "content": "When Pope Francis addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday morning \u2013 a first for a pope \u2013 he looked out on the most Catholic Congress ever . Just over 30 percent of the lawmakers are Roman Catholic , with that group evenly balanced between Democrats and Republicans .\nWhile these members may be in agreement on religious affiliation , they \u2019 re often at odds over politics . Indeed , Francis arrives at a time of great tension on the Hill , as abortion politics plays out in a funding battle that could trigger a government shutdown next week . And because of the pope \u2019 s views on climate change , one Catholic lawmaker , Rep. Paul Gosar ( R ) of Arizona , says he \u2019 s boycotting the address .\nStill , Catholic members are clearly honored \u2013 and excited \u2013 by the visit , which has caused them to reflect on their faith and the message of this popular pope .\nHere are the views of six Catholic lawmakers ahead of the address \u2013 their hopes for healing of the body politic and the effect of their religious beliefs on their outlook as legislators .\nBefore he got into public service , the congressman \u2013 originally from Boston \u2013 considered the priesthood . He spent six years studying at a Catholic seminary . He views the pope \u2019 s visit through the lens of history , recalling his boyhood excitement over John F. Kennedy \u2019 s presidential campaign .\n\u201c I was an Irish-Catholic Bostonian bursting with pride that one of our own was running for president , \u201d Representative Connolly relates in an interview in the chandeliered speaker \u2019 s lobby of the House . \u201c Imagine the chagrin I felt when I saw the headline of Time magazine and Newsweek at that time , saying , \u2018 Can a Catholic be president ? \u2019 and questioning our patriotism , our allegiance to the country . \u201d\nIt was a \u201c shock \u201d that anyone would even ask such a question , or that the nominee would have to answer it , he says .\nConnolly describes the integration of Catholics and their religion in the \u201c great American mosaic \u201d as coming to \u201c full resolution \u201d with the invitation to Francis to address the Congress \u2013 and the nation .\nCan other religions , such as Islam , make a similar journey ?\n\u201c I think so . America is always a work in progress , \u201d he says . \u201c We \u2019 re about ultimately expanding rights . Widening inclusivity . Broadening opportunity . And so acceptance and tolerance is in our future , and more of it . \u201d\nLike other lawmakers , Senator Collins says her faith \u201c informs \u201d her political philosophy but doesn \u2019 t \u201c dictate \u201d it .\nFor instance , she doesn \u2019 t agree with the Catholic Church \u2019 s teachings on contraception and early-term abortions . But unlike many of her Republican colleagues , she \u2019 s very glad the pope is sounding the alarm over climate change .\nIn her college days at St. Lawrence University , the senator took a course in Christian ethics . She was surprised that a whole unit was devoted to the environment and stewardship .\n\u201c The concept of stewardship , and that we should leave the earth in a better condition for the next generation , is very much a biblical concept , \u201d she says . Francis \u2019 views on that \u201c reinforce \u201d her own .\n\u201c This pope \u2019 s message of inclusiveness , forgiveness , mercy , and love is so appealing to me as well as to lapsed Catholics and people who aren \u2019 t even Catholic , \u201d says Collins , who planned to bring her mother , in her late 80s , to the address .\nThe senator hoped that the pope \u201c appeals to our better natures , that he preaches a message of unity and compassion for others that are less fortunate , and that he challenges us . \u201d\nOver the past 20 years , Mr. Boehner has invited three popes to speak before Congress . One finally accepted . It fulfills a dream for a man with Catholicism deeply anchored in himself .\nBoehner grew up in a big working-class family \u2013 the second of 12 children . He went to Mass before school and said prayers with his football teammates and coach at his Catholic high school .\nPrayer is a big part of the speaker \u2019 s life . When friends first suggested he run for Congress , he declined . But he went each morning for a month to church and prayed about it .\n\u201c Apparently , after a month , he got the answer , \u201d says his former chief of staff Mick Krieger , in a video about the speaker .\n\u201c I have my conversations with the Lord . They start in the morning early , and they go on all day long . You can \u2019 t do this job by yourself , \u201d Boehner has said .\nThe speaker had a one-on-one with Francis before the pontiff took his place in the House . After the address , the pope moved out to the speaker \u2019 s balcony to greet the crowds on the West Lawn of the Capitol .\nThe speaker \u2019 s office planned to record the visit from beginning to end at speaker.gov/pope .\n`` I think there 's a lot of interest in what the pope is saying , his outreach to the poor , the fact he thinks people ought to be more religious , '' Boehner said in a video released by his office . `` He 's got some other positions that are a bit more controversial . But , it 's the pope ! \u201d\nItalian-American , the daughter of a politician father ( who was mayor of Baltimore ) , and a longtime public figure herself , the top Democrat in the House has an unusual history of encounters with popes .\nThey started in the eighth grade , when she visited Pope Pius XII in Rome with her family , she recounts to reporters . As a young woman , she stood along the papal parade route in Manhattan , thinking that Pope Paul VI had seen her waving . She knows better now , she laughs .\nShe speaks reverently of Pope John Paul II , whom she welcomed to San Francisco in 1987 , and of the writings and speeches of Pope Benedict XVI , whom she met in Rome in 2009 . He is the author of her favorite encyclical , \u201c God is love . \u201d\nThe visit of Francis to Congress \u201c is thrilling beyond words. \u201d He will speak as a head of state , she says , so \u201c it won \u2019 t be a blessing. \u201d And yet , Catholics such as herself are \u201c overwhelmingly almost emotional about the religious experience of his coming . \u201d\nShe may not agree with the church on abortion \u2013 a woman has God-given free will , in her view \u2013 but the pope \u2019 s \u201c commitment to focusing on the climate crisis \u201d is an \u201c act of worship. \u201d Ditto on his emphasis on helping the needy .\n\u201c To minister to those needs is an act of worship , to ignore those needs is to disown the God who made us . That \u2019 s how I see his visit . \u201d\nThe freshman lawmaker from Miami says that \u201c being a practicing Catholic makes me very hopeful about my role as a legislator \u201d and what Congress can do to help the neediest people in the country and the world . His faith , he says , \u201c indirectly \u201d influences his policy decisions .\nRepresentative Curbelo is a product of a prestigious Catholic boys \u2019 school , Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami . Its motto is \u201c Men for Others , \u201d and he carried that interest into his work on the Miami-Dade County School Board before being elected to Congress last year . His focus in the House is on reforming poverty programs , K-12 schooling , and higher education .\nCurbelo hoped that the pope would speak broadly about issues , rather than make specific policy recommendations . Highlight climate change ? A good idea . Prescribe a carbon tax ? Not so good . Call attention to the Syrian refugee crisis ? Please . Ask the United States to take 100,000 refugees ? That would be an \u201c inappropriate \u201d suggestion .\nMore than anything , Curbelo hoped Francis \u201c inspires us and shows us that we can work together here. \u201d Being from a swing district , the young congressman is taking a pragmatic approach to politics and is willing to compromise .\n\u201c Maybe the pope can help renew the Congress in some way , \u201d he says .\nUp in his office on the third floor of the Capitol , the second-ranking Democrat keeps a Roman Catholic prayer book that belonged to his grandmother .
