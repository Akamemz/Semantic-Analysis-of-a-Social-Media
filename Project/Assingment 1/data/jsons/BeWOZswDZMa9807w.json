    "content": "The United States and five other world powers have reached a deal with Iran that would place strict limits on Tehran \u2019 s nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on its economy , the culmination of years of delicate diplomacy pursued by President Barack Obama despite warnings the agreement could strengthen Iran \u2019 s Islamist regime and leave it dangerously close to a nuclear bomb .\nThe historic accord , reached by Secretary of State John Kerry and his international counterparts in Vienna on Tuesday after 18 days of intense negotiations , now faces review from a hostile Republican-led Congress , opposition from every GOP presidential candidate , from Israel \u2019 s government and from Sunni Arab monarchs . The deal \u2019 s long and complex implementation process also leaves it vulnerable to unraveling .\nSpeaking from the White House Tuesday morning , Obama called the deal a victory for diplomacy that would prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and avert a possible conflict with Iran .\n\u201c No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East , \u201d Obama said . He reaffirmed America \u2019 s commitment to Israel \u2019 s security and Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia , while adding that the U.S. is \u201c open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect . \u201d\nObama also hinted at the possibility of a larger thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations . \u201d It is possible to change , \u201d Obama told Iranians , urging them to take a \u201c different path , one of tolerance , of peaceful resolution to conflict\u2026 This deal opens an opportunity to move in a new direction . We should seize it . \u201d\n\u201c This is the good deal that we have sought , \u201d Kerry said in a statement from Vienna .\nIf it succeeds , the agreement could upgrade Obama \u2019 s checkered foreign policy legacy , as well provide a crowning achievement for Kerry \u2019 s 30-year political career . Analysts call it one of the modern era \u2019 s most important arms control agreements , in a league with the 1970 international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the 1994 START nuclear missile treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union .\nSome believe it could begin to normalize relations between Iran and the West after three decades of cold war , although Obama and Kerry have denied that is their goal , while others predict that an emboldened Iran will seek greater dominance across the Middle East . But on Tuesday the European Union \u2019 s top foreign policy official , Frederica Mogherini , called the pact \u201c much more than a nuclear deal , \u201d adding : \u201c It can open a new chapter . \u201d\nOn Twitter , Iran \u2019 s president , Hassan Rouhani said that with the \u201c unnecessary crisis resolved , new horizons emerge with a focus on shared challenges . \u201d\nThat will hardly please Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who tweeted : \u201c From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is a historic mistake . \u201d\nAccording to a 159-page document posted online by Russia \u2019 s foreign ministry , which it called the final text of the deal , a U.N. resolution lifting sanctions will also express the Security Council \u2019 s \u201c desire to build a new relationship with Iran . \u201d\nThe text says also that Iran has vowed that \u201c under no circumstances \u201d will it ever \u201c seek , develop or acquire any nuclear weapons. \u201d And it describes a joint commission composed of its seven parties to monitor the deal \u2019 s implementation .\nOne issue that will draw close scrutiny from nuclear experts is Iran \u2019 s ability to research advanced nuclear technologies while its program is constrained by a deal . Iran now relies on 1970s-era centrifuges to enrich uranium , which are highly inefficient . The document posted by Russian foreign ministry says that after 8\u00bd years Iran can begin testing up to 30 modern IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges . Analysts fear that , if Iran masters top-quality centrifuges , it might be capable of producing a bomb in a matter of months or weeks soon after the deal \u2019 s main restrictions lift in a decade .\nOn an issue that snagged the talks in their final days , the deal will free Iran from an arms embargo after five years , Obama said Tuesday .\nObama has made the deal a central plank of his foreign policy . Dating from early in the 2008 presidential campaign , he called for fresh thinking toward American adversaries like Iran . As president , he has argued that it is wiser to negotiate with a nemesis of more than three decades than risk a military confrontation over Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions .\nBut he has also insisted , in response to the many critics who called him desperate for a deal , that signing off on a weak agreement is not in his interest . \u201c If Iran has a nuclear weapon , it \u2019 s my name on this , \u201d the president said in May \u2014 a measure of just how keenly aware he is of the deal \u2019 s implications for his legacy .\nThe deal came 18 days after Kerry arrived in Vienna for a round of talks whose initial deadline was June 30 . As early July came and went , the talks bogged down in a handful of issues , including whether and how to lift a U.N. embargo on Iran \u2019 s import and export of conventional arms .\nKerry , too , was accused of wanting a deal too badly , a charge his marathon session in Vienna \u2014 all of it on crutches , as he recovers from a broken leg \u2014 may have defused .\nThe comprehensive deal fills in the details of a preliminary framework deal reached in April by the U.S. and its negotiating partners \u2014 France , Germany , Britain , China and Russia . A document said to be about 100 pages will be transmitted to Congress and made public , although some portions are expected to remain classified .\nObama \u2019 s main goal has been to impose limits on Iran \u2019 s fast-advancing nuclear program to ensure that Tehran can \u2019 t acquire a nuclear bomb faster than the U.S. and its allies can act to stop it . The deal seeks to do that by reducing Iran \u2019 s capacity to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium , slowing its research and development into nuclear technology , and imposing inspections and monitoring of Iran \u2019 s nuclear activities to prevent cheating .\nThe goal is to achieve a \u201c breakout time \u201d \u2014 or the time it would take Iran to produce the nuclear material required for one bomb \u2014 of at least one year . That is long enough , U.S. officials believe , for the world community to take punitive action that could include airstrikes against Iranian facilities .\nSome elements of the deal were locked in by an April 2 political framework agreement reached in Lausanne , Switzerland . They include a commitment by Iran to reduce its number of installed centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104 , with only 5,060 of those enriching uranium for 10 years . Centrifuges spin gaseous uranium at supersonic speeds to increase its purity to levels suitable for a nuclear weapon .\nIran has also agreed to modify a plutonium-fueled nuclear reactor so that its fuel can not be reprocessed for use in a weapon . And it will allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency broad access to suspected nuclear sites , as well as cooperate with an IAEA investigation into its past activities , although many crucial details have yet to be released .\nThe comprehensive agreement will leave many powerful critics deeply dissatisfied . Netanyahu , who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country , has said repeatedly that the deal will \u201c pave Iran \u2019 s path to the bomb \u201d ; several Sunni Arab states , especially Saudi Arabia , worry that the end of sanctions will free up tens of billions of dollars that Iran can direct to militant allies like Hezbollah and sectarian battles from Iraq to Syria to Yemen .\nThe emerging outlines of the deal have also drawn withering fire for months from Capitol Hill , fueled by Republicans \u2014 and many Democrats \u2014 who agree with Netanyahu that it jeopardizes Israel \u2019 s security . A vote of disapproval by Congress would prevent Obama from lifting sanctions on Tehran , although administration officials believe they can maintain enough Democratic backing to sustain a presidential veto .\nThe nuclear talks began after years of Western worry over Iran \u2019 s nuclear aims , despite Tehran \u2019 s insistence that its program was only for scientific and energy purposes .\nThe 2002 revelation of Iran \u2019 s uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a plutonium reactor at Arak \u2014 sites previously undeclared to the U.N. in violation of Iran \u2019 s international commitments \u2014 badly undercut Tehran \u2019 s claims .
