The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his .\n( CNN ) In recent weeks , hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined a growing chorus urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president .\nI am not endorsing her as a candidate , at this point . But I am excited about the movement that is pushing her candidacy , unlike a whole bunch of Beltway types who have lined up to say how silly the whole notion is .\nWarren will not run , they cry -- though a draft movement has convinced her before . And even if she did , she would not win -- though no one gave President Obama a chance , either .\nStill , even if all of the naysayers are somehow on to something , the folks supporting `` Run Warren Run '' -- MoveOn.org , Democracy for America , and the Working Families Party -- and `` Ready for Warren '' have it right . Here is why :\nEven Democrats who support other candidates acknowledge that big banks and other special interests have rigged the game in Washington . Our whole party understands that inequality is worse than it has been since the 1920s , and we need to build an economy where everyone has a fighting chance .\nIn fact , it is not just Democratic voters who are emboldened by Warren 's fight for working families ; her ideas ring true in red states and blue states , in rural parts of America and in big cities like Boston and Chicago .\n`` I came out of a hardworking , middle-class family , '' Warren often says , in some variation . `` I came from an America that created opportunities for people like me , and I now see an America where the government works for people who already have money and power . '' It is , in her own words , `` time to remind politicians that they do n't work for the big banks -- they work for us . ''\nThat is a voice that would add real value to any party 's primary , but especially a party that purports to stand up for working people .\nContested primaries feature robust discussions on the most pressing issues facing our nation -- and the best ideas for making America stronger . Now , more than ever , we need those discussions .\nMany Democrats are voting with Wall Street , while Republicans shout about flat wages . Our country and the Democratic Party deserve a real debate over what we stand for .\nAnd there is a great place to have these debates : in states like Iowa and New Hampshire , where voters are ready to ask candidates tough questions and hear their platforms .\nIn the absence of a competitive primary , some have even speculated that there may not be any Democratic debates before the general election . Call me old-fashioned , but I want to nominate a presidential candidate who has answered tough questions on the crucial issues facing hardworking Americans today .\nSome argue that a vigorously contested primary would actually hurt the Democratic Party , that a competitive primary could split the Democratic base or force the eventual nominee to spend too much time and money too early . In other words , exactly what happened in 2008 .\nPrimaries leave candidates fit , tested , experienced and prepared for the grueling general election campaign . And as we saw in 2008 , all that organizing leaves the party energized and ready to get to work .\nThe Republican primary will unquestionably be highly competitive . Some analysts are predicting that more than a dozen GOP candidates will mount serious bids for the party 's nomination .\nThe eventual Republican nominee will enter the general election in fighting shape , with months of experience winning debates and votes over his or her party allies .\nIf the Republican contest features a spirited debate and the Democratic primary generates no news , the result will be two years of free publicity for right-wing talking points and conservative attacks on President Obama 's record , with a battle-ready Republican candidate .\nI have tremendous respect for Hillary Clinton .
