    "content": "Much of my time is spent criticizing politicians for misrepresenting the impact of their policies . So , for once , I 'd actually like to note an area where the Trump White House has represented the impact of its policies more accurately , and even better , than any other administration : economic growth forecasts . It may not sound like much , and I 'd rather they balance the budget , but that 's a start .\nThe Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires that each administration report `` the economic and programmatic assumptions '' underlying a budget . The result is a database of every administration 's growth forecasts released since 1975 . Using this data , the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) just released a report showing that this administration `` is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office . ''\nThe report displays two charts that span the Carter administration through the Trump administration . One chart shows the first year in office , the other the second year , and each show what the administration forecasted growth to be versus what was achieved .\nFor both years , the Trump administration 's actual growth was equal or slightly higher than the projected growth rates . While it forecasted growth of 2.3 percent during Trump 's first year in office , it reached 2.5 percent . In the second year , its projection of 3.1 percent was equal to actual growth .\nBy comparison , President George W. Bush 's projections were seriously off during his first year in office . His administration predicted 2.6 percent growth but only achieved 0.2 percent . His second-term projections were again overly optimistic by nearly a full percent . Growth projections for his father , President George H. W. Bush , were off by 0.6 percent during his first year and by 1.7 percent in his second year . President Ronald Reagan 's projections were only off by 0.1 percent in his first year , but his forecast was off by 4.6 percent during his second year due to a recession .\nThe Trump administration 's accuracy is an interesting anomaly .

It 's also generally true , regardless of the country . Back in 2011 , Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel published a National Bureau of Economic Research paper on the unreliability of economic forecasting . Frankel looked at data from 33 countries and found a systematic bias toward overly optimistic official forecasts for gross domestic product and budget balances .\nOverly optimistic assumptions for economic growth lead to over-optimism in budget estimates .
