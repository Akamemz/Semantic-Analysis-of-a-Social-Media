Despite what he says , do n't make the mistake of thinking that he actually supports legalizing the undocumented .

Republicans campaign as tough on illegal immigrants, but they're soft on them once in office.\n\nSecond, look at history.

But they love unions, and unions hate immigrants.\n\nObama: Waiting will make immigration executive action 'more sustainable'\n\nStill, electing the right leaders is only half the job.
