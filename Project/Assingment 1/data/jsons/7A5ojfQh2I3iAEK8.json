    "content": "Several of Joe Biden \u2019 s most prominent endorsers in New Hampshire have been quietly signaling for weeks that the campaign needs to make changes if it wants to win the first-in-the-nation primary , interviews with Democrats directly familiar with the state operation reveal .\nUp until recently , Biden had maintained a comfortable standing in early polls in New Hampshire . But that advantage has disappeared amid the growing momentum and war chests of two neighboring state rivals , and now , as the official filing date for the primary kicked off on Wednesday , his early backers are blaming different parts of the campaign \u2019 s structure for hampering his ability to stay on top .\nSome Biden backers in New Hampshire believe the problems are at the national level , where they see a visible lack of direction that has trickled down to the early states for some time now . Others dismiss that dynamic as natural friction between any state and national teams , and say the greater issue is a communication breakdown happening on the ground .\n\u201c We just need to know who we \u2019 re supposed to be talking to on a regular basis , \u201d Peter Sullivan , a Democratic former state legislator , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThat critique was echoed in interviews with multiple Democrats who are publicly supporting Biden , including some who have worked on his previous presidential campaigns , as well as those who have longstanding ties to state politics .\n\u201c Communication has been a problem . We \u2019 re all busy but we all need direction , \u201d one longtime veteran of New Hampshire politics who endorsed Biden , said , expressing frustration about several aspects of the campaign .\nThe supporter added , \u201c there hasn \u2019 t been a lot of activity that I \u2019 ve been involved in . That \u2019 s their choice . They can use me as they like .

But supporters of Biden contend that while he doesn \u2019 t generate the same massive crowds , he \u2019 s better than both of the progressive senators at retail politics , and that his personal connection with people helps in the wooing process .\nHowever , a recent survey shows that style only gets Biden so far . In a University of New Hampshire poll released on Tuesday , Biden \u2019 s support reached its lowest point in the primary in the state , dropping from 24 percent in July to 15 percent . Rocketing past him were Sanders , with 21 percent , and Warren with 18 percent .\nAndy Smith , a professor at UNH who conducted the poll , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it shows the limitations of name recognition and the campaign \u2019 s \u201c electability \u201d argument .\n\u201c You \u2019 re electable until people don \u2019 t think you are , \u201d Smith said . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be extremely difficult and he \u2019 s going to have to have a fairly significant shakeup in the campaign to get things going . \u201d\nThen there \u2019 s the fundraising issue . The release of his third quarter totals revealed Biden \u2019 s campaign was more cash-strapped than other top-tier contenders . He raised $ 15.2 million over three months , ending with just $ 9 million on hand , compared to Sanders , who raised raised $ 25.3 million , Warren , who raised $ 24.6 million , and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who brought in $ 19.1 million during the same time frame .\nThat problem , one longtime surrogate said , rests solely with the national campaign .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the problem is as much in New Hampshire as it is in the upper echelon [ of the campaign ] , \u201d a longtime Biden surrogate in the state said . \u201c They have to adjust more , they have to be more flexible , and more cognizant of New Hampshire politics and what their staff is going through and how difficult it is . \u201d\nA Biden New Hampshire campaign official pointed to 10 offices and 50 staff on the ground , adding that they engage early backers by sending weekly updates , holding regular conference calls , and asking them to meet with organizing staff to provide advice .
