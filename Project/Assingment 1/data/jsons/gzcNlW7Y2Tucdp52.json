    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump is poised to breeze through another round of primary contests this week -- while the Republican Party splinters around him .\nTrump 's ascent to the top of the GOP , which was capped last week with Ted Cruz ' s devastating loss in the Indiana primary , happened so fast that even the billionaire himself was surprised . And the whipsawed party establishment now faces immediate choices -- none of which particularly appeal to them .\nWill they unite behind their party 's standard-bearer ? Will they sit out the 2016 campaign ? Or will they fight on , in a quixotic quest to undermine Trump ?\nTrump 's opponents are still sorting through the wreckage of the GOP primary season for a path forward . But it has become painfully clear over the past five days that party unification will be tough to come by , if it happens at all .\nPast presidents , party leaders and prominent Republicans are all choosing sides , from unenthusiastic acceptance ( Bob Dole ) to pledges not to vote for either party in November ( former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham ) to musings about a third-party bid ( Bill Kristol ) .\nTrump himself enters his first full week as the presumptive nominee by signaling that he has limited patience for or interest in the establishment 's rebellion . Though the election is six months away , he announced Monday that New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie will lead his transition team .\nAnd Trump will meet Thursday with Paul Ryan , after the House speaker 's extraordinary announcement to CNN 's Jake Tapper that he 's `` just not ready '' to support Trump .\nBut when CNN 's Chris Cuomo gave Trump a chance to take on Ryan and the GOP establishment during a `` New Day '' interview Monday , Trump demurred . His response : `` We 'll see what happens . ''\nHe used the interview to offer fresh evidence of his willingness to thwart tradition . Trump , who is building his presidential bid around his business acumen and knowledge of the economy , told Cuomo the U.S. should take the unprecedented step of defaulting on the debt `` because you print the money . ''\nTrump is making quite clear he does n't intend to cast off the provocative style on the campaign trail that alarmed the Republican establishment and resonated so deeply with primary voters . After spending days on the receiving end of criticism from the likes of Ryan , Romney and Graham , Trump and his supporters hit back -- hard .\nSarah Palin , a key Trump surrogate and 2008 vice presidential nominee , took the unusual step of backing the little-known Republican businessman challenging Ryan for his Wisconsin seat .\n`` Paul Ryan is soon to be Cantored , '' Palin told Tapper Sunday on `` State of the Union , '' referring to Eric Cantor , the former Republican House majority leader who was shockingly ousted by a primary challenger in 2014 .\n`` His political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people , and as the leader of the GOP , the convention , certainly he is to remain neutral , '' Palin said . `` And for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his . ''\nFor his part , Trump did n't seem too worried about the talk of the GOP disintegrating because of his nomination . Speaking on ABC 's `` This Week , '' Trump questioned the need for party unity , arguing that his campaign is unlike any before and wo n't rely on the same political calculations .\n`` Does it have to be unified ? '' he asked . `` I 'm very different than everybody else , perhaps that 's ever run for office . I actually do n't think so . ''\nHe went on : `` I think it would be better if it were unified . I think ... there would be something good about it . But I do n't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense .

''\nTrump , meanwhile , is shifting his gaze to the general election by trying to undercut Clinton 's advantage with women .\nFacing the likelihood of running against the first female nominee of a major party , Trump sought to recast Clinton 's image by reviving the impeachment saga of the 1990s and arguing that she was dismissive of women who had extramarital affairs with her husband .\n`` Hillary was an enabler and she treated these women horribly , '' Trump said Saturday in Spokane , Washington .\n`` And some of those women were destroyed , not by ( Bill Clinton ) , but by the way Hillary Clinton treated them after it went down . ''\nTrump is taking a risk with such comments , and even Palin seemed to question their effectiveness .\nWhen asked by Tapper about Trump 's critique of Clinton , Palin said , `` a lot of people may be obsessed with a public figure 's personal life , and they 're going to get all entangled in , you know , past indiscretions or whatever . ''\n`` But I think , for the most part , '' she went on , `` Americans are concerned about things like who will be able to appoint the next Supreme Court justices , which will affect an entire generation coming up .
