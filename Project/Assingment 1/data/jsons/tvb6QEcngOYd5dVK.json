Then again , each were faced with questions that demonstrated their weaknesses either in winning a Democratic primary or in November .\nSanders has increasingly highlighted Clinton 's acceptance of hefty speaking fees from major corporations and Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs , pointing to those speaking fees as evidence she ca n't be trusted to take on well-funded interests .\nJUST WATCHED Clinton : Wall Street interests are trying to defeat me Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton : Wall Street interests are trying to defeat me 01:06\nClinton was tested Wednesday night on whether she can explain why she accepted those speaking fees .\nClinton began her answer : `` I do n't know , that 's what they offered . '' She added that her talk on the campaign trail of prosecuting Wall Street 's bad actors has reversed big bankers ' perceptions of her .\n`` They 're not giving me very much money now , I can tell you that much , '' she said . `` Fine with me . ''\nShe was also asked , yet again , about her now 13-year-old vote to go to war in Iraq .\nShe has long admitted that vote as a mistake , and has a well-honed explanation of how she 'd avoid similar mistakes in the future .\nBut the questions keep coming . Sanders , having voted against the war in Iraq , keeps reminding everyone about the differences between his vote and Clinton 's . And he uses Clinton 's Goldman Sachs speeches as a concrete sign of her connections to Wall Street .\nThe primary battle is now on friendly terrain for Sanders : a state that 's overwhelmingly white and liberal . But it will soon shift west , to Latino-heavy Nevada , and south , to largely African-American South Carolina .\nClinton has a huge advantage among those voters -- and Sanders is still working to broaden his appeal , to explain his idea of `` democratic socialism '' and to get comfortable reaching out to specific populations .\nAsked about police brutality and racial injustice , Sanders said it 's `` an important question that is on the minds of millions of people , not just African-Americans , but -- but all people . ''\nAnd on religion , Sanders said that yes , he has strong religious and spiritual feelings , but rather than talking about faith he steered the conversation back to action and his campaign 's economic themes .\n`` I believe that , as a human being , the pain that one person feels , if we have children who are hungry in America , if we have elderly people who ca n't afford their prescription drugs , you know what , that impacts you , that impacts me , '' he said .\n`` And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say , it does n't matter to me , I got it , I do n't care about other people .
