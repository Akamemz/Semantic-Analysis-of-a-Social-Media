Ambassador Susan E. Rice in a memo to push the favorable story line anyway on national television .\nThe Sept. 15 , 2012 , late-afternoon email from White House adviser Ben Rhodes , now the No . 2 official on the National Security Council , was released this week under the Freedom of Information Act to a conservative legal organization . It offers what appears to be the first clear evidence that the White House sought a political edge in the confusing aftermath of the worst U.S. diplomatic tragedy in decades .\nUnder the heading \u201c Goals \u201d for Ms. Rice \u2019 s appearance on five Sunday talk shows , Mr. Rhodes wrote to other White House communications officials that a main objective of Ms. Rice \u2019 s interviews should be to \u201c reinforce the president and the administration \u2019 s strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges . \u201d\nA second goal was to link the Benghazi attack \u2014 and those on other diplomatic sites across the Middle East \u2014 to an obscure anti-Muslim video and to insist that the protests were not \u201c rooted \u201d in a \u201c broader failure of [ administration ] policy . \u201d\nCritics such as Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , called the Rhodes memo a \u201c smoking gun \u201d backing charges that the Obama administration covered up its security and policy failures regarding the Benghazi attack to protect the president \u2019 s image at a politically sensitive time . Administration officials said the memo reflected the best assessment of a confusing situation and referred not to Benghazi but more generally to unrest spreading throughout the Middle East and North Africa .\nAhead of circulation of the email by the activist group Judicial Watch , Mr. Graham and fellow Republican Sens . Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and John McCain of Arizona wrote a letter Monday calling for another round of investigative hearings into the White House \u2019 s response to the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack in which Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed .\nFor months , the White House and top intelligence officials denied that politics played any part in their description of Benghazi and was simply an effort by the intelligence community to sort through contradictory facts about what happened on the ground .\nBut Mr. Rhodes \u2018 email suggests that the White House also was looking to use the tragedy and Ms. Rice \u2019 s appearances on the Sunday talk shows to burnish the president \u2019 s political image two months before Election Day .\n\u201c I think that people have come to trust that President Obama provides leadership that is steady and statesmanlike , \u201d Mr. Rhodes in the email as one of the \u201c top lines \u201d for Ms. Rice to strike during her TV appearance . \u201c There are always going to be challenges that emerge around the world , and time and again he \u2019 s shown we can meet them . \u201d\nIn another section of the email , Mr. Rhodes wrote that if pressed about a story circulating in some corners of the media that week that the Benghazi attack represented an intelligence failure , Ms. Rice should offer the following response :\n\u201c The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. Consulate. \u201d The White House has acknowledged that subsequent revelations contradicted that original story .\nThe Rhodes email does not contradict the established narrative about Benghazi \u2019 s aftermath \u2014 that the White House was feeding Ms. Rice talking points crafted by the CIA .\nJust hours before Mr. Rhodes wrote the email , a top CIA official alerted the White House that the spy agency \u2019 s station chief in Libya no longer believed the original accounts that the Benghazi attack grew out of a protest over an anti-Islam video and instead was carried out by Islamic extremists who planned the assault .\nIn rare public testimony on Capitol Hill this month , former CIA Deputy Director Michael J. Morell revealed how he and others at CIA learned Sept. 14 that there appeared to be no protest on the ground from a report from its officers in Libya , and that a day later , on Sept. 15 , the CIA \u2019 s station chief sent an email reinforcing that the attack was not preceded by a protest .\nBut Mr. Morell also testified that neither he nor other CIA officials moved to edit the protest information from draft talking points crafted by the CIA at the time because agency analysts had not definitively ruled out that scenario .\n\u201c The analysts had an evidentiary basis to make the judgment that there was a protest ongoing at the time of the attack , \u201d Mr. Morell said . \u201c Altogether , there were roughly a dozen or so reports indicating that this was the case . \u201d\nThe next day , Sept. 16 , Ms. Rice went on Sunday talk shows with the account that the attack was believed to have been started by protests over an American-made anti-Islam video .\nMr. Morell testified that he did not know the talking points on which he had worked would be used by Ms. Rice for the purpose of a public account on TV .\nNonetheless , by Sept. 18 , 2012 , two days after Ms. Rice \u2019 s appearance , the CIA received a report from the Libyan government that security footage outside the Benghazi complex showed no protest before the attack . U.S. officials reviewed the footage over the next few days . By Sept. 22 , the intelligence community revised its analysis and formally declared that the attack was related to terrorism and was not preceded by a protest over the anti-Islam video .\nIn releasing the Rhodes email on Tuesday , Judicial Watch claimed in a statement that the main point of the White House strategy at the time was to portray the Benghazi incident as \u201c rooted in an Internet video and not a failure of policy . \u201d\n\u201c Now we know that Obama White House \u2019 s chief concern about the Benghazi attack was making sure that President Obama looked good , \u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement .",
