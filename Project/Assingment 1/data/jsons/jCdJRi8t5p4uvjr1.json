It \u2019 s kind of a radical notion and a little outside the box , but here goes : How about , just once , you stop sucking-up to the foreign bastards who are attacking our country and take America \u2019 s side ?\nMaybe you should not back and excuse the gay-hanging , women-stoning , airline-downing , Obama check-cashing , Israel-threatening , American-murdering cultists ruling Iran . Just a thought .\nNow , I know what you \u2019 re thinking . You \u2019 re thinking what your man-bunned grad student TA taught you , that \u201c Hey , America sucks and these foreigners have a good point about America \u2019 s history of imperialism and general badness. \u201d Well , this is a stupid thing to think and you Democrats should stop thinking it . Instead , you should stand with your own country all the time , no matter what .\nI know siding with America will infuriate a huge part of your base , since America-hating leftist pieces of Schiff are a key Democrat constituency , but you should try courageously standing up to the trash that forms the foundation of your reeking party instead of collaborating with those fifth columnist communists .\nYes , I know it \u2019 s a proud Democrat tradition stemming back to when your party started , and then ensured the communists won , the Vietnam War . During the last decades of the Cold War , which the Republicans won , you sided with the Russians \u2013 for you younger Democrats , Russians only became bad to Democrats sometime in 2016 . Still today , if there is a Third World USA-hating potentate or terrorist leader , that dirtbag can count on you . Say , does your vintage Che tee still fit ?\nBut this act is getting old , like your leading presidential candidates .\nPerhaps in your blue city/faculty lounge circles , concepts like \u201c patriotism , \u201d \u201c loyalty \u201d and \u201c not allying yourself with communist and Islamist butchers \u201d are character defects that , if you drones had the capacity to breed , you would attempt to breed out of the pack . But here in America , we like them . And we prefer Americans who side with America .\nI know you don \u2019 t like Donald Trump . You have a right not to like Donald Trump . And if you feel it necessary , because you want to fix the skyrocketing stock market and rock-bottom unemployment problems he caused , you can campaign against Donald Trump and support his opponents , whether it be the senile pappy of the promiscuous crack connoisseur , or the fake Indian , or the crusty communist , or that insufferable little weasel who is mayor of the Indiana equivalent of Barstow . That is your right as an American . But you are total garbage if you choose to side with our enemies because you don \u2019 t like the guy who the American people elected over your objection .\nHe is the President of the United States of America . You don \u2019 t have to like that . You don \u2019 t have to like him . Feel free to run around the country shouting about how \u201c He \u2019 s not my president ! \u201d But don \u2019 t ever side with our enemies because you are mad at him for crushing the Venezuela 2 : The Quickening dreams of your idol Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit .\nYou spent the last three years babbling like idiots about \u201c traitors \u201d and \u201c treachery. \u201d Well , head docs call that \u201c projection. \u201d You are siding with the enemy in a war against the United States . And yeah , Iran has been at war with the United States for 40 years , ever since your peanut-farming , half-wit fellow Dem handed over the keys to the country to a bunch of Seventh Century Pennywises . The least you could do is show a little respect to the people trying to clean up your party \u2019 s mess .\nYour party \u2019 s latest triumph is blaming Donald Trump because these drooling morons shot down a passenger airliner the night they launched missiles at our American soldiers . What the hell is wrong with you ? Are you sick ? Are you stupid ? Are you huffing that funny powder you found in Hunter Biden \u2019 s medicine cabinet ? What would ever have possessed you to start making excuses for people trying to kill Americans ?\nThere \u2019 s a term in the military for people like you : \u201c Blue Falcons. \u201d It derives from the initials \u201c BF. \u201d The initial \u201c B \u201d is for \u201c Buddy. \u201d I \u2019 m not going to spell out what the \u201c F \u2019 is for . But you \u2019 re Blue Falcons if you sided with Iran \u2019 s mullahs against your own country because you got the sadz that mean old Trump is president and not Stumbles McMyturn .\nYou know , this Soleimani guy , before Donald Trump turned him into a wet bag of disarticulated chunks , murdered over 600 Americans and who knows how many more foreigners . It \u2019 s okay to say that he \u2019 s bad , and that smearing him across a Baghdad boulevard was pretty damn awesome . Hell , it \u2019 s mandatory .
