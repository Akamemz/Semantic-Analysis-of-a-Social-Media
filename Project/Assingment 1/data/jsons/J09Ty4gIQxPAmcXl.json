    "content": "A newly released audio recording purports to feature a young Barack Obama saying he believes in government `` redistribution '' -- a comment that Mitt Romney quickly seized on to claim his opponent thinks `` the government should take from some to give to the others . ''\nThe tape , posted on YouTube , was a throwback to the web video that emerged in 2008 showing Obama telling `` Joe the Plumber '' he wants to `` spread the wealth around . ''\nThis recording purportedly was from a 1998 conference at Loyola University . In it , the young Obama tells the audience he believes there has been `` a propaganda campaign against the possibility of government action and its efficacy . ''\n`` I think that what we 're going to have to do is somehow resuscitate the notion that government action can be effective at all , '' Obama says . `` I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution -- because I actually believe in redistribution , at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody 's got a shot . ''\nThe broader context of the talk is unclear . But Romney , who on Tuesday faced criticism about some of his own comments in a secretly recorded video , pointed to the Obama recording in arguing that he and his opponent have sharply different views on government .\nMore On This ... Romney defends donor comment , says more jobs will mean more paying taxes\n`` I know some believe the government should take from some to give to the others , '' he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` I think the president makes it clear in the tape that was released today that that 's what he believes . I think that 's an entirely foreign concept . ''\nRomney , for his part , has endured a wave of criticism from Democrats over a video showing him speaking at a private fundraiser back in May . In the video , Romney could be heard saying the 47 percent of people who do n't pay federal income tax `` believe they are victims '' and will support Obama `` no matter what . ''\nRomney defended his comments in the interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday -- and then cited the Obama recording to underscore his point that he and the president come at the job with two entirely different philosophies .\n`` Frankly , we have two very different views about America , '' Romney said . `` The president 's view is one of a larger government . There 's a tape that just came out today ( with ) the president saying he likes redistribution . I disagree .\n`` I think a society based upon a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role , redistributes money , that 's the wrong course for America . ... The right course for America is to create growth , create wealth . ''\nRepublican Party Chairman Reince Priebus also flagged the YouTube link on his Twitter account , with the comment : `` TELLING ! ''\nThe Obama campaign has not responded to a request for comment . But Obama hit back at Romney during a taping of the `` Late Show '' with David Letterman , disputing that Americans who are n't required to pay federal income taxes are `` victims '' and taking issue with Romney 's comment that he did n't have to worry about those voters .\n`` My expectation is that if you want to be president , you have to work for everyone , not just for some , '' Obama said .",
