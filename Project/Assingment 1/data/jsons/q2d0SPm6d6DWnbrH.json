Sanctions may be a good way of registering US displeasure and causing Russia economic pain, but they may well not produce the desired outcome, a change in Russian policy.\n\nThe world's economic balance of power is slowly changing - sanctions imposed by a once-dominant US is a weapon that is gradually weakening and some believe their overuse could accelerate this process.\n\nWho is affected by the sanctions?\n\nChina's Equipment Development Department (EDD), which is responsible for improving China's military technology, and its head, Li Shangfu, are sanctioned for completing \"significant transactions\" with Russia's state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.\n\nThe EDD and Mr Li have been added to a Blocked Persons List, meaning any assets they hold in the US are frozen and Americans are \"generally prohibited\" from doing business with them.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A Russian S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system in Crimea\n\nFurthermore, the EDD is denied export licences and excluded from the American financial system.\n\nWashington also blacklisted an additional 33 people and entities associated with Russian military and intelligence.\n\nWhat other US-China tensions are there?\n\nThe two countries are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has imposed three waves of tariffs on about 40% of China's roughly $500bn of exports to the US and has also threatened further tariffs.\n\nChina has responded with tariffs on about $110bn of US exports.
