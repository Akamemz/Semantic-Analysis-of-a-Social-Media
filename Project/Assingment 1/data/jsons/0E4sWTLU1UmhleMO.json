    "content_original": "WHY THIS QUESTION MATTERS:\n\nAfter months of COVID-19 lockdowns, states across the country began to lift stay at home orders and restrictions at the end of May. Today, all 41 states which issued stay at home orders have begun lifting restrictions. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases surge across parts of the country, the opening process is being slowed or even reversed in several states.\n\nIf we use the 1918 Spanish Flu as our guide, we can presume a second peak is coming. In 1918, US cities which had implemented control measures to limit public interaction saw a second peak after they eased the restrictions. This is because the majority of their populations were not exposed during the initial outbreak and the communities did not develop a herd immunity.\n\nLawmakers are becoming increasingly concerned about rising infection rates and potential implications for overcrowded hospitals. Today, we\u2019ll walk through some of the pros and cons of reinstating widespread shutdown or stay at home measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nSHUTDOWNS TO DATE:\n\nOn March 19th, California became the first state to issue stay at home orders, followed by 41 other states as well as the District of Columbia. Even states that did not issue a stay at home order, including Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, implemented restrictions on certain social activities.\n\nAccording to a CDC Survey, 80% of Americans said they had self-isolated during this time.\n\nECONOMIC IMPACTS:\n\nThe economy has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Consumption makes up 70% of the US GDP and is especially hard hit with stay at home orders. Unemployment has soared, with 6.6 million applying for unemployment in a single week in March when the shutdowns began.\n\n\n\nSmall businesses have been especially hard hit as they lose revenue and have to cut payroll. However, virtually all sectors have been impacted.\n\nNON-ECONOMIC IMPACTS:\n\nShutdowns have also taken a non-economic toll. According to Forbes, there is also risk of increased kidney failure, homelessness (which is linked again to depression, drug addiction, alcoholism, and anxiety), poverty, unplanned pregnancies, and abuse.\n\nAdditionally, many individuals have begun to experience \u201cQuarantine fatigue,\u201d which occurs when people show low motivation or energy to comply with safety guidelines. During the early days of the pandemic most individuals were motivated to comply with restrictions based on fear. However, after three months where many people haven't seen someone infected, people begin to let their guard down and underestimate the threat of infraction and harm.\n\nONGOING THREAT:\n\nUnfortunately, the thread of COVID-19 is still very real.\n\nSome states are experiencing a rapid increase in cases since lockdowns have been lifted, leading many to question if another round of shutdowns will be needed.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the research.\n\nTHE COMMON THREAD:\n\nAmericans need to balance safety and prosperity.\n\nFIND YOUR THREAD:\n\nSupporters of another shutdown focus on preventing further infection and overwhelming hospitals. Opponents of another shutdown focus on the economic and health impacts of a shut down and ask if the pros really outweigh the risks.\n\nWhat do you think?",
