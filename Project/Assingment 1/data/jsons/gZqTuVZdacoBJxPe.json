Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , and Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , on Wednesday formally requested that the Justice Department 's inspector general launch his own probe into the department 's review of IRS activities .\nThe request marks a serious escalation of their complaints about the department 's conduct and , specifically , a decision to have a President Obama backer lead the investigation .\n`` The Department has created the appearance that it is not taking seriously its responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation of IRS misconduct , '' Issa and Jordan wrote in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz .\nSuch complaints have come to a head this week , as conservative groups and lawmakers worry that the investigation is fizzling -- eight months after the agency first acknowledged it singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status .\nIn their letter , Issa and Jordan cited a litany of concerns , including recent claims from administration officials that criminal charges in the case are unlikely . But they centered on the decision to appoint Barbara Kay Bosserman to lead the FBI probe . Campaign finance records show Bosserman has given more than $ 6,000 to Obama 's two presidential campaigns .\n`` Publicly available information suggests that Ms. Bosserman may have a conflict of interest in this matter , '' they wrote , also citing a Fox News report that she attended a bill-signing ceremony at the White House in 2009 .\nSeparately , the lawmakers wrote to Labor Secretary Thomas Perez asking him about any possible involvement , given his prior position as Bosserman 's boss in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department .\nThe Justice Department , though , has pushed back hard on those questioning Bosserman 's fitness for the role .\nOne official said last week that simply because a trial attorney exercised her constitutional right to make a political donation does not mean she 's not acting professionally .
