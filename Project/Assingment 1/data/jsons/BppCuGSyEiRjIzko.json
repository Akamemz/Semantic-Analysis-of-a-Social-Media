(Photo: Anthony Wahl, The Janesville Gazette via AP)\n\nThree times a day, a Chevy van full of Milwaukeeans pulls out of a church parking lot and makes an hour-long drive to Sheboygan County, Wis., where they go to work. In Milwaukee, one says, he\u2019d be washing dishes for $8 an hour, maybe $9, and the hours would be sparse. In Sheboygan, he\u2019s making $15 an hour at an auto parts factory.

Last month, the Sheboygan County Economic Development Corporation paid to add two more vans.\n\nThis is how you fight poverty: person to person. The Joseph Project is an example of what community leaders are doing across Wisconsin and America.
