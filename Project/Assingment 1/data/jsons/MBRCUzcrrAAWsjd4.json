You \u2019 ve got over 400,000 pages to look at\u2014a few more isn \u2019 t going to make a difference .\nOn Thursday , with the release of a half dozen emails by Grassley and several more by Sen. Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) , the Democrats have been proven right . Brett Kavanaugh has misled the Senate at least four times , and the censored emails have been withheld not because of national security or executive privilege , but , at least in part , because they make Kavanaugh look bad .\nThe clearest contradiction between Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s sworn testimony and the formerly confidential email record concerns the nomination of Judge William Pryor , a conservative firebrand . In 2006 , Kavanaugh was asked , by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy , whether Pryor \u2019 s extreme statements disturbed him . Kavanaugh replied that he was not involved in the selection or vetting of Judge Pryor .\nWhen Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-VT ) asked him Thursday , \u201c did you interview William Pryor ? \u201d Kavanaugh hedged a bit , saying \u201c I don \u2019 t believe so . It \u2019 s possible but I don \u2019 t believe so . \u201d\nLeahy responded by entering a formerly-confidential email into the record that states clearly that Kavanaugh actually did interview Pryor . \u201c How did the Pryor interview go ? \u201d he was asked in December , 2002 . \u201c Call me , \u201d he replied .\nEven if Kavanaugh \u2019 s 2018 hedge protects him against perjury , his flat denial in 2006\u2014only three years after the Pryor nomination itself\u2014is clearly a false statement given under oath .\nAs we reported Wednesday , Leahy challenged Judge Kavanaugh over his role in \u201c Memogate , \u201d a 2003 scandal in which a low-level Republican aide named Manuel Miranda stole Democratic memos from a shared server . At his 2006 hearing , Kavanaugh denied receiving any stolen documents . Now , Kavanaugh says that while he may have received stolen documents , he didn \u2019 t know they were stolen .\nThursday , some\u2014but apparently not all\u2014of the Memogate emails were released , and they cast serious doubt on those claims .\nFor example , on March 28 , 2003 , Miranda sent Kavanaugh an eight-page email\u2014subject header \u201c For use and not distribution \u201d \u2014that is obviously a cut-and-paste from a Democratic strategy document . ( Sample quotes : \u201c Here are just five examples that clearly refute the Republicans \u2019 incorrect claims. \u201d \u201c That is already far more cooperation than this Senate has received from this Administration. \u201d ) Even a casual reader would know that this is an internal Democratic party document , let alone the Republican staffer in charge of judicial nominations . Kavanaugh \u2019 s claim that there was \u201c nothing untoward \u201d in the documents he received strains credulity .\nMoreover\u2014and ironically , given the quasi-confidential nature of the emails in question\u2014we now know that Kavanaugh received Democratic documents marked as confidential . A just-released email from Miranda , dated July 28 , 2002 , says that \u201c Senator Leahy \u2019 s staff has distributed a confidential letter to Dem [ ocratic ] Counsel. \u201d Miranda does not say how he somehow came into the possession of this confidential letter\u2014though he does impudently \u201c ask that no action be taken by any of your offices\u2026 except as I request . \u201d\nOne of Kavanaugh \u2019 s most ludicrous denials is about a June 5 , 2003 , email regarding Supreme Court confirmations that has the subject line \u201c spying \u201d and the first line \u201c I have a friend who is a mole for us on the left. \u201d \u201c None of this raised a red flag with you ? \u201d Leahy asked incredulously . \u201c It did not , Senator , \u201d answered Kavanaugh . \u201c Again , people have friends across the aisle who they talk to\u2026 and there was a lot of bipartisanship on the committee . \u201d\nWait\u2014so being a \u201c mole \u201d and performing \u201c spying \u201d is actually a sign of bipartisan comity ? Credit to Judge Kavanaugh for making such statements with a straight face .\nA third clearly false statement made by Kavanaugh under oath regards his involvement in President Bush \u2019 s \u201c Terrorist Surveillance Program , \u201d known by most people as the warrantless wiretapping program .\nOn Wednesday , Judge Kavanaugh said he first learned about it from a December 2005 article in The New York Times .\nOn Thursday , an email was released showing that Kavanaugh emailed John Yoo , the Department of Justice lawyer responsible for the Bush-era \u201c torture memo , \u201d about the program on Sept. 17 , 2001 . \u201c Any results yet on the 4A implications of random/constant surveillance of phone and e-mail conversations of non-citizens who are in the United States when the purpose of the surveillance is to prevent terrorist/criminal violence ? \u201d Kavanaugh asked .\nUnless there \u2019 s some bogus distinction to be drawn between acts of random/constant surveillance and a program of random/constant surveillance , that makes Kavanaugh \u2019 s statement on Wednesday a lie under oath .\nGrabbing most of the headlines are Kavanaugh \u2019 s somewhat conflicting statements on Roe v. Wade . In fact , this is the least smoking of the emails \u2019 smoking guns , but given that the entire confirmation process has been owned by this one issue , the disproportionate attention is understandable .\nAt issue is an op-ed which Kavanaugh was drafting which originally said that \u201c it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land \u201d \u2014language quite similar to that used by Kavanaugh himself in his confirmation hearings .\nIn a 2003 email , however , Kavanaugh said \u201c I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent , and three current Justices on the Court would do so . \u201d\nAsked about the apparent contradiction Thursday , Kavanaugh noted that it is factually true that \u201c all legal scholars \u201d do not agree that Roe is the settled law of the land . Of course , \u201c all legal scholars \u201d don \u2019 t agree on anything at all , which is why phrases like that are known as \u201c weasel words , \u201d since they allow the writer to weasel out of meaning anything .\nSpeaking of splitting linguistic hairs , Kavanaugh then reiterated his view that Roe is a precedent . But that is precisely not the same thing as the \u201c settled law of the land. \u201d Indeed , Kavanaugh \u2019 s point in the email is exactly that : While Roe is a precedent , it isn \u2019 t considered \u201c settled law \u201d because the Supreme Court can overrule its own precedent .\nReally , Kavanaugh \u2019 s careful choice of words\u2014precedent rather than settled law\u2014is yet another bit of clear evidence that he does not believe Roe , which he has called part of a \u201c tide of freewheeling judicial creation of individual rights , \u201d is beyond overturning . Obviously .\nFinally , the just-released emails contain a treasure trove of compromising , embarrassing statements by Kavanaugh\u2014and no security concerns . This is exactly what Democrats have been saying for weeks : that President Bush \u2019 s lawyer ( formerly Kavanaugh \u2019 s deputy ) , the Trump White House , and Sen. Charles Grassley can not be trusted to edit this material .\nMost damning is Kavanaugh \u2019 s ( rejected ) proposal that John Yoo , as noted above the primary author of the infamous Bush administration torture memos , be made an appellate court judge .\nAs we noted last month , the torture memo is one of the greatest black holes in the withheld emails . Did Kavanaugh know of the torture program ? Did he offer a legal opinion about it ? Did Kavanaugh agree with Yoo that \u201c severe pain and suffering \u201d only means pain \u201c associated with serious physical injury so severe that death , organ failure , or permanent damage \u201d would result ?\nAt least the last question can be answered . Surely he did\u2014his recommendation was made only days after Yoo \u2019 s memo was circulated .\nThe overwhelming majority of the legal academic community regards the torture memo as not only false , not only one of the lowest points in American human rights history , but tantamount to encouraging war crimes . Kavanaugh thought it should be rewarded with life tenure on the federal bench . And once again , none of this would be known had the \u201c committee confidential \u201d emails not been released .\nSecond are the remarks Kavanaugh made regarding racial profiling in the wake of 9/11 . On Jan. 17 , 2002 , he wrote in an email that he and others \u201c DO need to grapple\u2014and grapple now\u2014with the interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented. \u201d In other words , although Kavanaugh says he \u201c generally favor [ s ] effective security measures that are race-neutral , \u201d non-race-neutral measures\u2014i.e. , racial profiling\u2014will still have to be used in the meantime .\nOnce again , this is explosive material : a nominee for the Supreme Court has endorsed racial profiling , at least on an \u201c interim \u201d basis . Likewise with comments questioning whether Hawaiians count as Native Americans and accusing backers of affirmative action as acting in bad faith .\nLastly , other emails are just plain embarrassing\u2014discussions of gambling losses , for example\u2014or highly revealing . For example , here \u2019 s Kavanaugh coaching a judicial nominee : \u201c She should not talk about her views on specific policy or legal issues . She should say that she has a commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent , that she understands and appreciates the role of a circuit judge , that she will adhere to statutory text , that she has no ideological agenda. \u201d Sound familiar ?\nThat playbook is no secret , of course , but it certainly gives the lie to any notion that Kavanaugh is really answering the questions put to him . He is lip-synching the same words he instructed other nominees to lip-synch 15 years ago .\nOf course , none of this may matter . Republican senators have held their noses and put up with Trump for 20 months just to get to this moment\u2014they \u2019 re not going to blow it now just because of a little perjury , racism , using stolen documents , and suborning of torture .\nThen again , if the Democrats are smart , they \u2019 ll keep drip-drip-dripping a few emails a day for the next several weeks . After all , there \u2019 s no real justification for these \u201c committee confidential \u201d emails to be withheld , and no real explanation for the conflicts of interest among those selecting which emails to release . At a certain point , the narrative may shift ; a centrist consensus may develop that Kavanaugh is just too much of a political operative who has said too many problematic things . It \u2019 s not likely , but it is possible .\nUndoubtedly , there \u2019 s still much more that we don \u2019 t know . At the very least , Leahy said there are emails proving Kavanaugh met with Manuel , the leaker , in a bar to exchange documents\u2014we haven \u2019 t seen those yet . But more likely , if these couple of dozen emails are reflective of the hundreds of thousands of pages still under wraps , we literally ain \u2019 t seen nothing yet .",
