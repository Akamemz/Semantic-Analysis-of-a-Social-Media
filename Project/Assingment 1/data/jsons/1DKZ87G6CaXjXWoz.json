    "content": "President Barack Obama , FBI director James Comey , and deputy attorney general Sally Yates in the Oval Office , June 13 , 2016 ( Carlos Barria/Reuters )\nObama officials and FBI collaborated to invent the \u2018 Russian collusion \u2019 narrative\nThe FBI coordinated very closely with the Obama White House on the investigation of Michael Flynn , while the Obama Justice Department was asleep at the switch . That is among the most revealing takeaways from Thursday \u2019 s decision by Attorney General Bill Barr to pull the plug on the prosecution of Flynn , who fleetingly served as President Trump \u2019 s first National Security Advisor . Flynn had been seeking to withdraw his guilty plea to a false-statements charge brought in late 2017 by Special Counsel Robert Mueller .\nWhile working on the Trump transition team in December 2016 , Flynn spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak , in conversations that were intercepted by our government ( because Russian-government operatives , such as Kislyak , are routinely monitored by the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies ) . Among the topics Flynn and Kislyak discussed was the imposition of sanctions against Russia , which President Obama had just announced .\nThat these conversations took place has been known for over three years \u2014 ever since a still-unidentified government official leaked that classified information to the Washington Post . For almost as long , it has been known that the FBI became aware of the Flynn\u2013Kislyak discussions very shortly after they happened . What was not known until this week was that then\u2013acting attorney general Yates was out of the loop . She found out about the discussions nearly a week afterwards \u2014 from President Obama , of all people .\nThis was at a White House pow-wow on January 5 , 2017 . That was the day when the chiefs of key intelligence agencies briefed top Obama White House officials on their assessment of Russia \u2019 s meddling in the campaign . After the main briefing , the president asked Yates and FBI director James Comey to stick around to meet with him , along with Vice President Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice . Yates was taken aback when Obama explained that he had \u201c learned of the information about Flynn \u201d and his conversation with Kislyak . She was startled because , she later told investigators , she \u201c had no idea what the president was talking about . \u201d\nYates had to figure things out by listening to the exchanges between President Obama and FBI director Comey . The latter was not only fully up to speed , he was even prepared to suggest a potential crime \u2014 a violation of the moribund Logan Act \u2014 that might fit the facts .\nAccording to an FBI report , which was appended ( as Exhibit 4 ) to the Justice Department \u2019 s motion to dismiss the Flynn case , Yates later said she was \u201c so surprised by the information she was hearing that she was having a hard time processing it and listening to the conversation at the same time . \u201d\nThat Yates was in the dark was not the FBI \u2019 s fault . Two days earlier , the bureau \u2019 s then\u2013deputy director , Andrew McCabe , had briefed Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord , the head of DOJ \u2019 s National Security Division , about the Flynn\u2013Kislyak discussions . Evidently not appreciating what the FBI regarded as the urgency of the matter , McCord did not pass the information along to the acting AG before her White House meeting .\nMs. Yates \u2019 s astonishment at how well-informed the bureau was keeping the president calls for revisiting something to which I \u2019 ve called attention before . It now seems even more significant .\nWhen General Flynn was forced to resign as national-security adviser after just three weeks on the job , the New York Times did its customary deep dive , in which seven of its best reporters pressed their well-placed sources for details . It was a remarkable report , which recounted \u2014 as if it were totally matter-of-fact \u2014 that Flynn \u2019 s communications with Kislyak had been investigated by the FBI in real-time consultation with President Obama \u2019 s aides . For example ( my italics ) :\nObama advisers heard separately from the F.B.I . about Mr. Flynn \u2019 s conversation with Mr. Kislyak , whose calls were routinely monitored by American intelligence agencies that track Russian diplomats . The Obama advisers grew suspicious that perhaps there had been a secret deal between the incoming [ Trump ] team and Moscow , which could violate the rarely enforced , two-century-old Logan Act barring private citizens from negotiating with foreign powers in disputes with the United States .\nInteresting . The FBI tells Obama \u201c advisers \u201d about Flynn \u2019 s discussions with Kislyak . Between this and their surprise that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin did not retaliate when Obama imposed sanctions , the Obama \u201c advisers \u201d dream up a non-existent pact between Trump and the Kremlin \u2014 collusion ! And they \u2019 re already thinking about nailing Flynn on the Logan Act . . . an obsolete , unconstitutional vestige of the President John Adams administration that has never , ever been prosecuted in the history of the Justice Department ( the last case appears to have been in 1852 ; DOJ was established 18 years later ) .\nWho came up with that ? Well , Ms. McCord ( whose interview is Exhibit 3 in the DOJ \u2019 s Flynn dismissal motion ) later told investigators that the Logan Act flyer originated in the office of Obama \u2019 s director of national intelligence , James Clapper \u2014 specifically proposed by ODNI \u2019 s general counsel , Bob Litt . Obviously , by January 5 , Comey was already discussing it with Obama .\nLet \u2019 s look at some more of that Times report on Flynn \u2019 s downfall . For the legal analysis of Flynn \u2019 s exchanges with Kislyak , the president \u2019 s aides consulted the FBI , not DOJ :\nThe Obama officials asked the F.B.I . if a quid pro quo had been discussed on the call , and the answer came back no , according to one of the officials , who like others asked not to be named discussing delicate communications . The topic of sanctions came up , they were told , but there was no deal .\nSo no misconduct . To the contrary , the incoming national-security adviser asked a Russian counterpart to discourage his government from escalating tensions , which is what we would want any American diplomat to do . \u201c There was no deal. \u201d Sanctions were merely mentioned , as one would expect since they \u2019 d just been imposed , but Flynn made no agreement to accommodate the Kremlin in any way .\nBut see , those are the actual facts . Who cares what actually happened ? What matters , it turns out , is what \u201c Obama advisers \u201d and their FBI co-creators could imagine it into : There must be Trump collusion with Russia because we \u2019 ve concluded Putin would otherwise have retaliated .\nThis was nothing new for the FBI . Remember , at that point , they are already in the FISA court ( and at that time , were about to go back for a renewal warrant ) telling the judges they suspect members of Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign are in a \u201c conspiracy of cooperation \u201d with the Putin regime . Their proof of that ? The Steele dossier \u2014 uncorroborated Democratic Party\u2013and Clinton-campaign-sponsored propaganda that they already have immense reason to know is claptrap .\nMeanwhile , with Yates at the helm , the Justice Department had major reservations about the FISA warrants \u2019 reliance on the Steele dossier , but swallowed hard and went along with it . The Justice Department had major reservations about the Logan Act as a predicate for investigating Flynn , but Yates was too startled to speak up at the White House meeting . The Justice Department wanted Comey to alert the Trump White House about the Flynn\u2013Kislyak discussions , but the FBI refused . . . and Yates did nothing . By the time , after days of temporizing , she finally decided to put her foot down , Comey told her he had already dispatched agents to do an unauthorized ambush interview of Flynn . Yates was \u201c dumbfounded , \u201d McCord recalled .\nThe Justice Department appears to have spent much of its time \u201c flabbergasted , \u201d to quote McCord again . But in the end , it would always go with the collusion flow . Meanwhile , empowered and emboldened , the FBI ran rings around its nominal superiors .\nSo what did President Obama make of all this theorizing from the FBI and his \u201c advisers \u201d ? Well , intriguingly , as she was leaving her office for the last time , Obama \u2019 s top adviser , Susan Rice , decided that her last official act , moments after Trump was inaugurated , would be to craft \u2014 15 days after the fact \u2014 an email memorializing Obama \u2019 s directive at the January 5 meeting :\nPresident Obama said he wants to be sure that , as we engage with the incoming [ Trump ] team , we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we can not share information fully as it relates to Russia .\nHmm , you mean a reason like \u201c Trump and his minions just might be colluding with the Kremlin \u201d ?\nYou \u2019 d almost think the Obama White House and its intelligence apparatus were weaving a political narrative out of . . . nothing .",
