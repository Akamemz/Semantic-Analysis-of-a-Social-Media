    "content": "A year is an eternity in politics , the saying goes . If that \u2019 s true , then two years is an eon . And it seems an eon ago that the common wisdom held that the GOP was entering its \u201c libertarian moment , \u201d when the heirs of Barry Goldwater would finally come into their inheritance and retake the party they had long believed was their one true home .\nThat faction today suffers from PTSD , political-trauma shock disorder . Its champions , Rand Paul and Ted Cruz , were decisively routed in the 2016 Republican primaries . The winner , Donald Trump , is about as diametrically opposed to Goldwaterism as is possible in the GOP , a man who seemingly has no political conscience , much less that of a conservative . The question one hears in any D.C. watering hole is also on the lips of millions of Republicans nationwide : \u201c What has happened to my party ? \u201d\nSenator Jeff Flake , once a leader of liberty-minded Republicans , said that this departure from past orthodoxy was merely temporary as he announced he was not running for reelection . \u201c This spell will eventually break , \u201d he told his Senate colleagues . And so it shall , if by that he means the current movement to define Republican loyalty as unquestioning loyalty to presidential whims . But the truth he overlooked is that the GOP long ago stopped sacrificing at the altar of small government .\nNow it is true that the Republican party is overwhelmingly conservative and that most conservatives oppose high taxes and government direction of society . Polls have shown for decades that Republicans of all stripes believe that the government is doing too much that would be better left to business or voluntary charity . But being opposed to passing something new does not necessarily mean you are also in favor of repealing or modifying something old . And it is when you examine the depth of that sentiment that you find how shallow the commitment to small government is among GOP voters .\nIn our book The Four Faces of the Republican Party ( 2016 ) , University of New Hampshire professor Dante Scala and I looked at 20 years of exit-poll data to discern what Republicans believed . We found that at most one in six could be called liberty-minded conservatives , people who wanted both smaller government and lower taxes and made that their principal priority . These voters , whom we called \u201c very conservative seculars , \u201d were the smallest of the GOP \u2019 s four factions and had been since at least 1996 , when our data series began . Their favorites for the nomination , candidates such as Steve Forbes and Fred Thompson , always lost , and usually quite early , as the favorites of the other GOP factions trounced them in the early states , where momentum is built .\nSteve Forbes crashed and burned in 1996 and 2000 , and Fred Thompson met an early end in 2008 . Mitt Romney , whom many would never have said was a spokesman for liberty-minded conservatives , emerged as their favorite in 2008 , but he , too , failed to finish as high as even second place when the primary season was over , as social conservative Mike Huckabee soundly defeated him in a host of contests in conservative states on Super Tuesday . In 2012 , it was social conservative Rick Santorum who became the only serious challenger to Mitt Romney , who had already moved to the left in an attempt to capture the GOP nomination .\nCandidates who have run as modern Goldwaters have long been an afterthought in presidential politics . This is often obscured by the degree to which hardline conservatives win primaries for lower offices . One must note how they win those races \u2014 almost always as avatars of social conservatism , foes of abortion and supporters of religious liberty and tradition . Our research showed that it is these appeals , not the invocations of economic liberty , that move the vast majority of movement-conservative voters .\nVery conservative Evangelicals are the second-largest faction of the Republican party and easily the largest throughout a host of largely rural southern and midwestern states . In presidential primaries , candidates who express their worldview , which is focused on God and a defense of Christian culture , easily outpoll economic conservatives . Pat Buchanan , Mike Huckabee , and Rick Santorum have all been favorites of this group , and each at one time emerged as the strongest challenger to the eventual Republican nominee .\nThis fact explains why Ted Cruz moved from being an apostle for the Tea Party when he was elected to the Senate in 2012 to being a disciple of social conservatism in his 2016 presidential race . He became adept at using the words and adopting the priorities of Evangelical conservatives and launched his campaign at Evangelical-sponsored Liberty University . He also became the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2000 to unite all wings of movement conservatives behind his candidacy . His failure to capture the nomination , however , points to the real reason liberty-minded conservatives are in serious decline : Other conservatives don \u2019 t share their small-government convictions .\nThe largest faction of the GOP are those who tell pollsters they are \u201c somewhat conservative , \u201d and their priorities are quite different from those of liberty conservatives .

They always back the very person whom liberty conservatives come to view as the epitome of the \u201c establishment. \u201d In 2000 , for example , their support sustained Bush through the early primaries : The two groups of movement conservatives threw their backing behind W. only when the alternative was the much more moderate McCain .

But his years of antagonizing their leaders meant that he lacked their support when he needed it most . Cruz carried movement-conservative voters in his final primary in Indiana , but he nevertheless got annihilated , by nearly 17 percentage points , because Trump beat him by 21 percentage points among somewhat conservatives and by a whopping 36 percentage points among moderates and liberals .\nLiberty conservatives themselves have changed over the years as well , moving from an emphasis on controlling expenditures to an emphasis on cutting taxes .

He continued his quest throughout the 1980s , co-authoring the 1985 Gramm-Hollings-Rudman Act , which slowed the rate of federal spending growth .

Forbes propelled himself to victory in Delaware and Arizona , and to respectable showings in other states , by presenting a flat-tax plan but not a major spending-cut proposal . Eventually he faded under attack , but he retained the loyalty of liberty conservatives throughout the race until withdrawing after the March Super Tuesday contests , in which he finished behind Pat Buchanan in every state except Connecticut .\nForbes \u2019 s run that year changed liberty-conservative politics over the long term .

Liberty conservatives since then have wooed voters with similar plans , almost never providing details about spending cuts . When House Freedom Caucus leader Representative Mark Meadows ( R. , N.C. ) recently admitted that his group would support the Trump-backed tax cut without insisting on a dime of offsetting spending cuts to help pay for it , he merely demonstrated what has been true for a long time : No serious constituency of the GOP makes spending cuts its top priority .\nEven free trade and a welcoming attitude toward immigration , longtime liberty-conservative staples , are under assault in today \u2019 s GOP .
