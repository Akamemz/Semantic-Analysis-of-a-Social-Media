Bush \u2019 s interventionist , neoconservative footsteps ? Or will he offer hints \u2013 through references , for example , to America \u2019 s leadership of broad coalitions to address global challenges \u2013 of a more cautious and internationalist approach , reminiscent of his father , George H.W . Bush ?\nOr then again , will he meld the two visions , which do , after all , represent the two most prominent camps of Republican foreign policy thinking ? Or will he somehow manage to sound like neither the father nor the brother ?\nSuch questions almost never arise when it comes to Mr. Bush \u2019 s domestic policy vision , since the former Florida governor has a record and established , public views on issues ranging from education and fiscal policy to immigration .\nIndeed , when Bush speaks of a `` right to rise '' and share in America \u2019 s economic opportunities , no one asks whether that sounds more like the father \u2019 s or the brother \u2019 s domestic economic approach . But on foreign policy , he is much more of a clean slate \u2013 and so the question of which former Bush president he would more likely emulate can \u2019 t help but come up .\n`` Every candidate has to pass the commander-in-chief threshold test , and every candidate faces certain mine fields in passing that test , '' says Peter Feaver , professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham , N.C. `` The particular mine field for Jeb Bush is the advantage and the burden of his family name . ''\nFor starters , Bush will have to watch not to `` overreact to the media pressure , particularly on foreign policy , to answer the question , 'Are you your brother or are you your dad ? \u2019 `` Professor Feaver says .\nFurthermore , the memory of pitched foreign policy battles in the George W. Bush White House between father Bush \u2019 s pragmatic , internationalist wing ( think then-Secretary of State Colin Powell ) and the muscular neoconservatives behind the Iraq War ( Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , then vice president and secretary of Defense ) is sure to be on the minds of the foreign policy experts who will parse every word that Jeb Bush utters Wednesday . His talk is at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs .\nOne hint of Bush \u2019 s preferred foreign policy course comes from the former officials he admires and those he is consulting with as he explores a run . Bush is said to particularly value the contributions of former Secretary of State James Baker and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft \u2013 two pillars of the first President Bush \u2019 s pragmatic and internationalist foreign policy approach . ( Neither Bush I icon was particularly welcome at the Bush II White House . )\nWord has leaked out that Bush is consulting with former Deputy Secretary of State and former World Bank president Robert Zoellick ( the mild-mannered Mr. Zoellick left the George W. Bush administration in 2006 after failing to rise to No . 1 at either State or Treasury ) and Richard Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations .\nBush is also said to be considering making Meghan O \u2019 Sullivan , who served in George W.

Ms. O \u2019 Sullivan , who now teaches the practice of international affairs at Harvard University \u2019 s Belfer Center , is closely associated with the Iraq War \u2013 which might be considered a negative , given the war \u2019 s low marks among the American public .\nBut O \u2019 Sullivan is also credited with the \u201c surge \u201d strategy of 2007 that is viewed as having stabilized Iraq , and in some books she gets a star for weathering the demands of then-Defense Secretary Rumsfeld that she be removed from the post she held in post-invasion Iraq .\nYet while some foreign policy experts see a preference for the father \u2019 s foreign policy in the people Jeb Bush is consulting with , others see a tendency toward the brother \u2019 s vision in the few speeches he has made on foreign affairs .

'' But on the other hand , what may be riding to Jeb Bush \u2019 s rescue is the recent shift in US public opinion on foreign policy \u2013 increasingly away from a `` mind our own business '' approach that had been gaining ground in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , to a growing preference for more American intervention .\n`` Public opinion has turned around significantly over the last 14 months to favoring a much more robust US role in the world , '' says Robert Lieber , a professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington . `` I would assume that Jeb Bush would choose to tap into that as he lays out his foreign policy .
