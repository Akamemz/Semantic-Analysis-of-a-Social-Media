    "content": "Google announced new rules on Thursday about what employees are allowed to say in the workplace \u2014 including restrictions on political expression and guidelines on internal debates about company activity .\nThe new rules come as Google faces increasing scrutiny from politicians , the public , and its employees on a number of issues . Republicans , including President Donald Trump , continue to make unfounded accusations that the company \u2019 s products display a bias against conservatives . Employees on both sides of the political aisle have accused Google of retaliating against workers on the basis of their ethical and political beliefs . And internal debates over controversial projects , like a censored search engine for China , and company decisions , like how to moderate abusive content on YouTube , have created a growing rift between employees and leadership .\nIn an email sent to employees Thursday evening , Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained the company \u2019 s revised community guidelines , which now explicitly discourage workers from discussing politics on Google \u2019 s thousands of internal mailing lists and forums , several of which are devoted exclusively to discussing politics and related topics .\n\u201c While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community , disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not , \u201d the guidelines state . They warn employees that their primary responsibility is to \u201c do the work \u201d that they \u2019 ve been hired to do \u2014 \u201c not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics . \u201d\nThe new rules are a radical departure from how the historically open company has always functioned , and they demonstrate how seriously Google is confronting its ongoing struggle with internal dissent among its rank and file and external accusations of political bias .\nGoogle has long been known for allowing and even encouraging employees to debate and organize around controversial topics , including its product launches and national politics . That \u2019 s caused problems for the company , particularly as it \u2019 s scaled in size in an increasingly polarized political climate .\nShortly after President Trump was elected in 2016 , Google co-founder Sergey Brin said in an all-hands company meeting that he found the election \u201c deeply offensive \u201d as \u201c an immigrant and a refugee. \u201d He remarked that \u201c many people apparently don \u2019 t share the values that we have. \u201d Almost two years later , Breitbart News leaked video of that meeting , fueling conservative claims ( including from President Trump himself ) that the company is biased against Republicans .\nUnder the new policies , Google employees will be prevented from making statements that \u201c insult , demean , or humiliate \u201d the company \u2019 s employees , business partners , or \u201c others \u201d \u2014 including public figures . A Google spokesperson confirmed to Recode that those public figures would include elected officials such as Trump .\nEmployees won \u2019 t be allowed to engage in heated political debates that , for example , encourage or organize employees to vote for or against a specific candidate .\nThe company will also create enforcement mechanisms to police and discipline employees who don \u2019 t follow the new guidelines \u2014 including a \u201c central flagging tool \u201d where employees can report each other \u2019 s comments as inappropriate . A new team of internal community managers will then review these posts and help determine if they violate Google \u2019 s community standards . If they do , employees involved with the posts could face disciplinary action .\nA spokesperson for the company said that in most cases , the company would first try to educate employees before disciplining them . Part of the community managers \u2019 jobs will also be to work with moderators of internal listservs to help make sure those messages are following the new guidelines .\nGoogle first introduced internal community guidelines to regulate discussion on its many internal forums and email lists last year . While some employees appreciated the guidelines and saw them as an attempt to limit harassment between colleagues , others criticized the move for forcing Google employees to respect uncivil speech from their colleagues on the basis of respecting all sides .\nThese new guidelines are similarly likely to raise concern with employees , particularly that they could stifle workers \u2019 ability to speak out against Google \u2019 s own policies and practices . Last November , in what \u2019 s considered one of the largest moments of worker activism in the tech industry , 20,000 Google employees walked out of their offices to protest news that the company paid millions in buyout packages to executives who were accused of sexual harassment . And when employees raised concerns over controversial initiatives \u2014 such as Project Maven , Google \u2019 s plans to use its artificial intelligence to enhance US military drones , and Project Dragonfly , its efforts to build a censored search engine in China \u2014 Google eventually halted both projects .\nThe new guidelines state that employees \u201c are all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company \u2019 s activities , \u201d and that it \u2019 s \u201c part of [ Google \u2019 s ] culture. \u201d But at the same time , they warn employees that they \u2019 re forbidden from accessing or sharing \u201c need-to-know \u201d information or making \u201c false or misleading statements about Google \u2019 s products or business. \u201d Such guidelines reinforce the limitations on employees who engage in what they view as whistleblowing activity . ( Projects like Maven and Dragonfly were not widely known within or outside the company until employees made them public . )\nReining in Google \u2019 s unique workplace culture is a leviathan task that no single set of community rules could accomplish all on its own . But the company \u2019 s new restrictions show Google knows it can \u2019 t simply dismiss the political controversies surrounding its workplace and products . The world , and politics , have changed since Google was founded 21 years ago . It seems Google decided it was time to change , too .\nCommunity guidelines exist to support the healthy and open discussion that has always been a part of our culture . They help create an environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission and serve our users . Working at Google comes with tremendous responsibility . Billions of people rely on us every day for high-quality , reliable information . It \u2019 s critical that we honor that trust and uphold the integrity of our products and services . The following guidelines are official policy and apply when you \u2019 re communicating in the workplace .\nHere are some key things to remember as you communicate :\nBe responsible . What you say and do matters . You \u2019 re responsible for your words and actions and you \u2019 ll be held accountable for them .\nWhat you say and do matters .
