But the bill that 's being presented is unfair to those who came here legally . It will cost Americans trillions of dollars . It 'll make our unlawful immigration system worse . ''\nA 2007 study by Robert Rector , assuming all undocumented immigrants were granted `` amnesty , '' said the cost to the United States of immigration reform would be at least $ 2.6 trillion .
