    "content": "Congress is preparing to go home for the holidays having delivered a historic tax cut for corporations \u2014 and having done only the absolute minimum to stave off disaster for the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program .\nThe government spending bill released on Thursday , which Republican leadership hopes to pass in a matter of hours , would provide $ 2.8 billion that is supposed to fund the program through March .\nIt would prevent an impending disaster \u2014 nearly 2 million kids could lose coverage in January without congressional action \u2014 but it is a long way from the five-year extension CHIP advocates are seeking and that Congress has been sitting on for three months .\n\u201c It \u2019 s better than nothing , but the program will sputter along without the certainty it needs for states to feel confident enough to do outreach and put out the welcome mat for children , \u201d Joan Alker , executive director of Georgetown University \u2019 s Center for Children and Families , told me Thursday morning .\nShe added of the preferred five-year extension : \u201c Why not do that instead and do right by kids for the holidays ? It is troubling that they can \u2019 t get this done when they have had bipartisan agreement on the policy for months now . \u201d\nIn a matter of days , at least two states \u2014 Alabama and Connecticut \u2014 would stop enrolling new children in the program . Real negative impacts will be felt by some number of children across the country the longer Congress fails to act . This would be an unprecedented breach of trust for this program that everybody seems to agree is good and should be funded .\n\u201c Our phones are ringing off the wall , \u201d Alabama CHIP director Cathy Caldwell told reporters this week . \u201c We have panicked families wondering what in the world they have as options . \u201d\nIt would cost a mere $ 8 billion for Congress to extend the program , which covers 9 million American children , for the next five years . There is bipartisan support for the program . There is a working plan to do it , which the House already passed . There is no discernible reason that CHIP has been left unfunded for nearly 90 days or that families are starting to receive letters warning them that their coverage could soon end .\nExcept the Republican majorities in Congress didn \u2019 t make it a priority .\nDon \u2019 t get it wrong : Republicans do generally support CHIP . Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) helped write the law . He wants its funding extended . So do most of his colleagues . But they have limited time on their hands . They chose to pursue other priorities \u2014 first , a last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare , then a major tax overhaul centered on a massive corporate tax cut \u2014 instead of funding CHIP .\nInstead , Congress is scrambling mere days before states would start freezing CHIP enrollment . Their gambit will depend on Republicans actually managing to pass this spending bill .\nFor people working on CHIP , the damage is , in a sense , already done . The program \u2019 s reputation could take years to recover from the uncertainty sown over the past three months .\n\u201c This may go down as the worst year for children in Congress in decades , \u201d Bruce Lesley , president of First Focus , told me .\nFunding CHIP is a pittance next to the Republican tax cuts\nOn its face , it \u2019 s remarkable that Congress hasn \u2019 t yet found the money to extend CHIP for five years and take this headache away from them and the program \u2019 s families .\nCHIP costs about $ 12 billion to $ 14 billion each year . But because the Congressional Budget Office assumes the program will remain indefinitely , even if it hasn \u2019 t been funded yet , it technically only \u201c costs \u201d about $ 8 billion to extend CHIP for five years . ( This is wonky congressional budget math , but that \u2019 s how it shakes out . )\nThat is a minimal lift . Republicans just passed a $ 1 trillion corporate tax cut .\n( A quick note on the tax bill \u2019 s child tax credit : Republicans have expanded it , but in such a way that the poorest families will see a minimal benefit . The bigger benefits will go to families with higher incomes . )\nSo Congress needs to find $ 8 billion in spending cuts ( or new revenue ) to fund CHIP for five years and erase any risk that a kid in the United States would be denied or lose health insurance . They had no problem approving a tax bill projected to balloon the federal deficit by $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years . Extending CHIP should be no problem . But it \u2019 s still not done .\nThe House did pass a CHIP extension in early November , almost entirely with Republican votes ( though 15 Democrats also backed the bill ) . But it has been hampered \u2014 and likely isn \u2019 t viable in the Senate , where Democratic votes will be needed \u2014 by the spending cuts that Republicans chose to include .\nThe House paid for its CHIP funding by cutting Obamacare \u2019 s public health fund , by increasing premiums for higher-earning Medicare enrollees , and by shortening the grace period ( to one month ) for Obamacare enrollees who fail to pay their premiums . The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that last provision would lead to nearly 700,000 Americans losing health insurance .\nThat legislation also still came nearly a month after CHIP \u2019 s funding had technically expired . Congress hasn \u2019 t since found the time to work out a long-term deal that would actually extend the program for good and could actually pass the Senate and be sent to President Trump \u2019 s desk .\nBut they did find time to rush a massive tax overhaul through the House and Senate in less than two months .\nLet \u2019 s go back to mid-September , before CHIP \u2019 s funding had expired on October 1 and when advocates were warning Congress not to let the program lapse .
