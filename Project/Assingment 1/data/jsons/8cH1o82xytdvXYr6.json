Camarota , the center \u2019 s research director , who wrote the report along with demographer Karen Zeigler .\nHis numbers are stark : Since the first quarter of 2009 , the number of immigrants of working age ( 16 to 65 ) who are employed has risen 2 million , from 21.2 million to 23.2 million . During the same time , native-born employment has risen just 1 million , to reach 119.9 million .\nIt \u2019 s a trend years in the making : Immigrants are working more , and native-born Americans are working less .\nIn 2000 , 76 percent of natives aged 18 to 65 were employed , but that dropped steadily to 69 percent this September . By contrast , immigrants started the last decade at 71 percent employment and rose to a peak of 74 percent at the height of the George W. Bush-era economic boom .
