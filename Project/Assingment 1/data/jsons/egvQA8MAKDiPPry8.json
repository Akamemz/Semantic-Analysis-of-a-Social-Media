It has been halted by a federal appeals court , and its fate will soon rest with the Supreme Court .\nBut the rest of the dozen actions Mr. Obama announced on Nov. 20 , 2014 , are still advancing , including a far-reaching set of priorities that effectively orders agents not to bother deporting nearly all illegal immigrants .\n\u201c There are 7 or 8 or 9 million people who are now safe under the current policy .
