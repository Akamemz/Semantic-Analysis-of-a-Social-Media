    "content": "Trump-less Debate Sets A New Standard , But With A Familiar Outcome\nAs any bridge player can tell you , the game is different when there is no trump .\nOn Thursday night in Des Moines , Iowa , the seventh debate among major candidates for president in the Republican Party set a new standard in both substance and tone . And it did so because the front-runner in the 2016 nomination fight , Donald J. Trump , did not attend .\nGone were the outbursts and assertions from the charismatic billionaire who has upended the Republican nomination process . Gone were the personalized jibes and schoolyard taunts that have been a mainstay of earlier debates .\nThe seven candidates onstage seemed liberated , in varying degrees . There was also a sense that the electricity and the telegenic appeal of Trump 's unpredictable and bombastic moments were both missing and missed .\nThat meant the central figure onstage was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , who is running second to Trump in Iowa ( where caucuses will be held Monday night ) and contending with others for second in New Hampshire ( where the primary is Feb. 9 ) .\nCruz immediately tried to make a joke with pseudo-insults for everyone onstage : `` Let me say , I 'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid , fat and ugly . And Ben , you 're a terrible surgeon . Now that we 've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way ... ''\nThe joke drew a mixed response from the audience . Later , Cruz tried again , saying he 'd quit the debate if he got `` another mean question '' from moderators who , he said , kept inviting his rivals to attack him . That , too , seemed to elicit catcalls as well as applause .\nBoth of these thrusts were meant to satirize Trump 's boycott , which was at least initially cast as a rebuke to Fox News co-moderator Megyn Kelly .
