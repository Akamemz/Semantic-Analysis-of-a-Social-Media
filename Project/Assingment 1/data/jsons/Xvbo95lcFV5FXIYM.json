    "content": "Yes , there is a new accusation against Judge Kavanaugh . I 'll address the New Yorker piece at length later . For now , let 's stick with the more serious claim . With public testimony now set for Thursday morning , we are just a few days away from Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser relaying their stories , on the record and under oath . That piece of news emerged over the weekend , along with a few details about the conditions , which sound more sensible than some of the ludicrous demands initially laid out by Prof. Ford 's attorneys . But perhaps even more significant was a development that broke on Saturday evening . I received word that the mysteriously `` missing '' party attendee had finally been identified , and that she 'd made a formal statement through her lawyer that she never knew Kavanaugh and had no memory of ever being at any party with him :\nHearing that the other woman at the alleged party ( the one missing witness , as identified by the accuser ) has come forward & says she doesn \u2019 t know Kavanaugh & has no recollection of attending any party that he did .\nFour alleged witnesses . All four do not corroborate her story . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 23 , 2018\nSure enough , this update was confirmed in the press shortly thereafter :\nSetback for Ford team : Leland Keyser , believed to have been identified as one of 5 people at the party , told the cmte she \u201c does not know Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present , w/ or w/o Dr. Ford \u201d https : //t.co/QSaVkYixEs \u2014 Nicholas Fandos ( @ npfandos ) September 23 , 2018\nThis is very significant . One of the discrepancies in Ford 's story -- setting aside her inability to name the scene of the alleged assault , or even the month in 1982 in which it supposedly took place -- involves the number of people at the party , and the number of people involved in the claimed attack . She says two boys were in the room ( including Kavanaugh ) , but her therapist 's notes from 2012 ( the first time she spoke about the incident ) say that four boys were in the room . According to the Washington Post , Ford chalks this inconsistency up to a misunderstanding by her therapist , asserting that there were four boys at the party , not in the room . In her original letter to Sen. Feinstein , which the California Democrat sat on for roughly two months , Ford says there five total people at the party , including her . Having heard from Kavanaugh , Mark Judge , PJ Smyth , and the accuser , there was only one named witness who remained publicly unaccounted for . Until now . It turns out that this last witness was not a fourth boy , but a girl named Leland Ingham Keyser . That fact unto itself is another shift in Ford 's official story . But that 's not all :\n[ Keyser ] is now executive producer of Bob Beckel 's podcast . Keyser is the ex-wife of Beckel , a former Democratic operative and commentator . A search on OpenSecrets.org reveals Keyser 's only political donation has been to former Democratic senator Byron Dorgan . Keyser 's denial , as a female lifelong friend and Ford 's last named witness , is the most consequential development that has occurred since Ford publicly stepped forward last Sunday and detailed her allegations to the Washington Post . Ford 's allegation of the 1982 incident was told to no one until a 2012 therapy session , when Kavanaugh was first touted in the media as the most likely GOP Supreme Court nominee . All of Ford 's named witnesses of the party , both male and female , have now denied any recollection of attending such a party .\nThis final named witness is a female , a Democrat , and a longtime friend of the accuser . She states outright not only that she does n't recall attending this particular alleged party , but that she never knew Kavanaugh and was never at any party with him , as far as she can recall . So of the five people Ford places at this party 36 years ago , she is the only one who says it even took place . The other four have contradicted or rejected her memory of it , to varying degrees . This means that in addition to having zero contemporaneous corroboration of the assault happening ( Ford says she told nobody for 30 years ) , we do not even have any current corroboration that the alleged party occurred at all , based on the testimony of all other individuals Ford herself has named as the only other attendees .\nFord 's legal team is trying to downplay Keyser 's statement as insignificant , arguing that it 's not surprising that she would n't remember a party from so long ago , at which nothing remarkable happened to her . But the detail about never knowing Kavanaugh at all is an important one , especially since Ford specifically identified Keyser as one of the few people at that house . And it 's interesting to see many of the same people who were loudly demanding an FBI investigation -- in which the named witnesses would be interviewed -- quickly pivoting to casually shrugging off those witnesses ' lack of memories from 1982 as expected and inconsequential . Exactly :\nHuh . Ford 's lawyers flippantly dismiss the notion that any party witness could remember anything after demanding the FBI investigate and interview all the party witnesses . That 's ... something . \u2014 Scott Jennings ( @ ScottJenningsKY ) September 23 , 2018\nOpponents of Kavanaugh are rationalizing Keyser 's statement . But at this point we have nobody who admits to recalling the party ( even Ford 's friend ) and nobody who heard Ford talk about the assault at the time .\nFord may well be telling the truth .

She suggests that because she does n't like Kavanaugh 's judicial philosophy , he 's more likely to be lying about attacking a girl in high school . It 's a pathetic answer , but it 's also revealing . Hirono very much seems to care a lot more about keeping Kavanaugh off the court , whatever it takes , than she does about evaluating any facts about this accusation -- which she 's already categorically stated she believes . It 's almost as if she does n't care about Prof. Ford or the truth . And it 's almost as if she 's just latching on to anything that might derail Kavanaugh , hopefully allowing her party to leave the vacant SCOTUS seat open for two more years -- something else she 's also said out loud . If Democrats want impartial observers to believe that this is n't all a giant pageant of abject partisan hackery , they might want to keep Hirono away from the cameras until the process is over .",
