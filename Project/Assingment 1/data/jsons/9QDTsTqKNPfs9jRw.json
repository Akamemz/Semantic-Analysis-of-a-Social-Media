To ramp up the pressure , President Donald Trump will meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning .\nThe legislation , called the American Health Care Act , would rewrite the current health care system and lead to millions of more people being uninsured than under Obamacare , according to the Congressional Budget Office .\nThe bill will be taken up Wednesday by the House Rules Committee and set to be voted on by the House Thursday -- the seven-year anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act .\nMany of the amendments would make additional changes to Medicaid that were pushed by conservative members .\nOne addition would give states the option of requiring able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work , participate in job training programs or do community service .\nConservative-leaning members have been especially irked since Obamacare expanded Medicaid to 11 million able-bodied adults without children . Critics , however , say it will make it harder for many low-income Americans to get needed health care .\nAlso , the revised legislation would allow states to opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program .

This would reduce federal support for Medicaid even more since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment , which often happens in bad economic times .\nAnother alteration would immediately prevent states from expanding Medicaid , a concession to conservative lawmakers . Under the first version of the legislation , enhanced funding for Medicaid would be repealed as of January 1 , 2020 , but nothing barred states from expanding the program before that .\nHouse leaders also sought to win support from centrist Republicans from upstate New York leaders by adding a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing state Medicaid funds raised by local governments , according to New York Rep.
