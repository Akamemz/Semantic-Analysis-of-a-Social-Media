Rose McGowan, an actress and fellow Weinstein accuser, wrote on Twitter, \"My heart is broken.\"\n\nNeedless to say, Argento's behavior in this case does not change her status with regard to Weinstein. There's no unwritten law that says you can't be both a perpetrator and a victim of sexual misconduct. People are complicated.\n\nIt sounds like at the time the Weinstein allegations were being made public, Argento didn't necessarily know Bennett was uncomfortable with what had happened between them. He didn't threaten to sue her until after she was named in the Weinstein news cycle, in part because \"his feelings about [the incident] were brought to the forefront recently when Ms. Argento took the spotlight as one of the many victims of Harvey Weinstein,\" according to the legal documents.\n\nAlso of note: While Argento's alleged conduct does indeed meet the definition of sexual assault, this is only because the age of consent in California is 18. In most other states, it's 16 or 17. Since Bennett was 17 at the time of the encounter, it would have been legal for Argento to have sex with him in 39 of the 50 states. That doesn't make Argento's decision to have sex with this particular young man, with whom she had a quasi-maternal bond, any less creepy. But I'm a little uncomfortable using the word assault to refer to incidents between adults who are both clearly capable of consenting to sex, regardless of what the law says.",
