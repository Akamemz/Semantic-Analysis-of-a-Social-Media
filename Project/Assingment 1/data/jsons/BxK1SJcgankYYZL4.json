Most people with stable finances and conventional banking accounts tend to avoid them . The rates and fees seem exorbitantly high when extrapolated out over long time frames , as critics tend to do .\nThese critics , most of whom would prefer to regulate the payday loan industry out of existence , argue that its rates are structured to intentionally confuse customers and that the business model is inherently predatory , trapping the poor in cycles of debt they might otherwise avoid .\nThese arguments suggest that people who choose to use payday loans do n't , and perhaps ca n't , understand the choices they are making . For their own good , those choices should be prohibited by our enlightened , elected betters .

What she found was that customers knew exactly what they were doing when they took out loans , and they usually had good reasons for doing so .\nMany of them had previously had negative experiences with banks , in particular with overdraft fees , which tend to be higher than the rates charged by payday lenders when compared on an equal basis . Extended out over the course of a year ( which is longer than the typical repayment period ) , a typical payday loan has an annual percentage rate ( APR ) of about 390 percent ; over the same period , overdraft fees can range from 600 to nearly 800 percent . Bounced checks can result in effective annual APRs of more than 1,400 percent . Payday loans are n't cheap , but people with inconsistent cash flow often find that the alternatives are more expensive .\nServon learned that some payday loan customers needed cash more quickly than a bank would provide .
