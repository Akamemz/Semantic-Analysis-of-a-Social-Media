Since he made the bombshell announcement last Wednesday that the President had reimbursed his attorney Michael Cohen for the $ 130,000 paid to Stormy Daniels , Giuliani has appeared on several television shows and given interviews to more than half a dozen outlets .\nTrump has grown irritated by Giuliani 's performances and the headaches he has caused as contradictory statements between the two flash across the chyrons on his screen .\nThe President was initially pleased with his new attorney 's brashness , but that has steadily eroded as the parade of interviews has continued . Trump was irked by Giuliani 's interview on ABC News Sunday , particularly the clip of Giuliani refusing to rule out him pleading the Fifth Amendment , which has since played on a near-constant loop on cable television .\nGiuliani insisted that if the President were not happy with his performance , the President would let him know .\n`` We have been close friends for 30 years and we can say things to each other that others ca n't , '' he told Bash .\n`` The key people involved in this are very happy , '' Giuliani said , insisting he is totally on the same page as Jay Sekulow and other Trump lawyers .\nHe once again pointed to Tuesday 's decision on Iran and an upcoming planned summit with North Korea , saying their legal strategy `` freed him up to focus and put some wins on the board . ''\nWhen asked specifically about sources telling CNN that the President was annoyed with Giuliani leaving open the possibility of Trump pleading the 5th Amendment , again Giuliani pushed back .\n`` It 's the perfect way it should be done .

Since he joined , Giuliani and Trump have maneuvered the strategy separately from everyone else , and are expected to be the two who decide whether Trump will ultimately sit down with Robert Mueller .\nThe response in the West Wing to Giuliani 's arrival has been overwhelmingly negative .
