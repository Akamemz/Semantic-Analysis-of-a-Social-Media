    "content": "The Orlando massacre is sickening and frightening . It 's sickening on its face : Dozens of innocent people were shot to death by a remorseless , merciless fanatic on Saturday night , executed for the 'crime ' of carousing with friends at an establishment that caters to a clientele despised by their killer . It 's frightening because this horror was not perpetrated by masked men shouting slogans in an unfamiliar tongue thousands of miles away . It was n't carried out by trained practitioners of terror who hijacked airplanes and targeted symbolic nuclei of American power and wealth . No , like last year 's San Bernardino bloodbath , this atrocity unfolded in a mid-sized American city , at the hands of a young U.S.-born American citizen . Fact will be separated from fiction in the days to come , as details are clarified and leads chased down . What seems to be clear at this stage is that Saturday 's agent of destruction was a radical Islamist , inspired by ISIS and exhorted to action by instructions to murder and maim as many 'infidels ' as possible , particularly during Islam 's holy month of Ramadan .\nIn an utterly depressing storm of reactionary blame-casting , self-affirmation and point-scoring , far too many American partisans reacted by turning their grief and fury on one another . Some on the Left immediately applied their prefab gun control template to this act of savagery . The NRA was relentlessly scapegoated , and appalling equivalencies were drawn ; one Democratic Senator even called the US Congress `` complicit '' in the barbarity because it had n't passed the sorts of laws he favored . Never mind that the attacker was a US citizen who purchased his firearms legally after passing a background check ( despite this , this , and this ) . Never mind that he also reportedly had an ( obviously illegal ) explosive device in his possession , and conducted his rampage in a `` gun-free zone . '' Never mind that the understandable impulse to do something in the face of such unimaginable carnage leads some to a `` solution '' that would disarm law-abiding innocents , rendering them even more defenseless against maniacs who manifestly have no interest in respecting any laws or regulations . Tight Massachusetts gun control measures did not prevent the Boston bombing , which relied on pressure cookers packed with ball-bearings to destroy and kill . Strict California laws did not stop the San Bernardino shooters from obtaining high-powered weapons or constructing a makeshift bomb . Those are hard truths , but they 're truths nonetheless . Neither the sitting president nor the Democratic nominee to succeed him could bring themselves to call radical Islamist terror by its name -- even after the connection was quite clear -- in their initial statements on Sunday , yet both managed to invoke gun control slogans .\nMeanwhile , some on the Right seized on the Orlando outrage to claim validation for their over-broad views about Islam , to pillory political opponents , and to assert vindication for a proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigrants favored by the GOP presidential nominee -- who surreally congratulated himself for 'being right ' about the problem at hand , even as the dead and wounded were still being identified . Never mind that such a restriction would have done nothing to stop this individual , who was born in the USA and raised here for nearly three decades . Never mind that erecting a religious test for entry into the United States would be logistically shambolic , would risk needlessly alienating and hamstringing key Muslim allies whose help is essential in excising the Islamist cancer , and would arguably be flagrantly unconstitutional , depending on how it was applied . These are additional hard truths . Let 's face it : A tidy , ideologically-pure 'fix ' to this threat does not exist . We live in a country in which guns are -- and will remain -- readily available as a constitutional right , and in which armed law enforcement can not be everywhere at all times . By their very nature , free and open societies offer an endless supply of so-called `` soft targets '' that evil people can exploit if they choose to do so . And they are choosing to do so , even those who live in our midst and work alongside us for years . We should n't shy away from thoughtful debate over whether there are better ways to keep firearms away from dangerous people , nor should we avert our eyes from the very real cultural beliefs and attitudes that infect a far broader swath of Islam than many would prefer to believe . But neither railing against the gun lobby nor mindlessly castigating the whole of Islam accomplishes anything productive , even if these intellectual pacifiers offer some fleeting sense of catharsis or comfort .\nHorrific events like the Pulse bloodletting inevitably lead to a burst of thumb-sucking think pieces and news commentaries exploring `` why they hate us .

Which brings us to a final hard truth : What they loathe , and seek to annihilate through violence and fear , are our core values and our way of life . Radical Islamists shot up Charlie Hebdo because of its editorial refusal to spare the Prophet Muhammad from its trademark irreverent and even blasphemous satire .
