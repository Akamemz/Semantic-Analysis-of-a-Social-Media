In the face of the current crisis, legitimate privacy concerns must take a back seat to saving lives, they argue. Tech experts say systems used to track the virus could be built to ensure as much privacy as possible through rules requiring the data be anonymous, limiting how it can be used and setting a time frame for it to be deleted.
