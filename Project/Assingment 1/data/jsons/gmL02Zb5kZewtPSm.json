The employer requirements are among the most complex parts of the health care law , which is designed to expand coverage for uninsured Americans .\n`` We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively , '' Treasury Assistant Secretary Mark Mazur said in a blog post . `` We have listened to your feedback and we are taking action . ''\nBusiness groups were jubilant . `` A pleasant surprise , '' said Randy Johnson , senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . There was no inkling in advance of the administration 's action , he said .\n`` We commend the administration 's wise move , '' said Neil Trautwein , a vice president of the National Retail Federation . It `` will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment . ''\nBut the delay could also undermine the law 's main goal of covering the nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance . Already , Republican resistance in the states will deny access to a planned Medicaid expansion \u2014 at least for next year \u2014 to millions of low-income people .\nUnder the health law , companies with 50 or more workers must provide affordable coverage to their full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties if just one worker ends up getting government-subsidized insurance .

It will now be delayed to 2015 .\nMost medium-sized and large businesses already offer health insurance and the requirement was expected to have the biggest consequences for major chain hotels , restaurants , and retail stores that employ many low-wage workers . Some had threatened to cut workers ' hours , and others said they were putting off hiring .\nBusiness groups complained since the law passed that the provision was too complicated . For instance , the law created a new definition of full-time workers , those putting in 30 hours or more . It also included two separate requirements , one to provide coverage and another that coverage be deemed `` affordable '' under the law . Violations of either one exposed employers to fines . But such complaints until now seemed to be going unheeded .\nThere is no coverage mandate \u2014 or penalty \u2014 for smaller businesses . Also , for businesses of any size , there is no penalty if their workers are poor enough to be eligible for Medicaid .\nThe delay in the employer requirement does not affect the law 's requirement that individuals carry health insurance starting next year or face fines .
