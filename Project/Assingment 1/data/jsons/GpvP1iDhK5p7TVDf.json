    "content": "Trump , downplaying deaths , once claimed US would never see 100,000 milestone Trump suggested throughout April the country would n't reach 100,000 deaths .\nIn just under four months , more than 100,000 Americans are now reported to have died from the novel coronavirus , a grim milestone President Donald Trump once suggested the country would never see .\nRoughly a month ago , Trump , at a White House task force briefing , said , `` It looks like we 'll be at about a 60,000 mark , which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of . ''\nA few days later , on April 24 , he again sought to highlight a lesser number : `` Minimal numbers were going to be 100,000 people . And we 're going to be , hopefully , far below that . ''\nAs the politically fraught threshold neared Tuesday , he continued to play down the actual figure , using new language .\n`` If we did n't act quickly and smartly we would 've had , in my opinion and the opinion of others , anywhere from 10 to 20 and maybe even 25 times the number of deaths , '' Trump said , when asked to comment at a Rose Garden news conference .\nHe continued to make the unverified claim , as he does at every opportunity , that his decision to impose partial restrictions on travel from China , which took effect in early February , had made all the difference .\nAs the numbers shifted , the president has been consistent -- characterizing the ever-increasing death estimates as a relative success , compared to the 2.2 million death toll projection from the London Imperial College if the U.S. took no action to slow the spread of the deadly virus .\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a listening session with African-American leaders at Ford 's Rawsonville Components Plant that has been converted to making personal protection and medical equipment , May 21 , 2020 , in Ypsilanti , Mich. Alex Brandon/AP\nCasting himself as a `` wartime president '' in command of the country 's response to an `` invisible enemy , '' he has suggested American casualties were inevitable . He has deflected questions about what death toll he finds acceptable in exchange for reopening the economy by saying `` one death is too many . ''\nHe acknowledged Tuesday , in a tweet , that it `` looks like '' 100,000 `` will be the number . ''\nAs he encourages Americans to return to life before COVID-19 , using campaign-style slogans such as `` open up American again '' and `` transition to greatness , '' Trump has continued to spin the rising death toll as relative good news .\nIt was only three months ago when he said the coronavirus would `` disappear . ''\n`` You have 15 people , and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero , '' he said Feb. 26 at a coronavirus task force briefing .\nAnd when the first death in the U.S. was reported on Feb. 29 ( though an April autopsy would reveal an earlier death in California on Feb. 6 ) , the president held a campaign rally in South Carolina the night before , calling criticism of his response the Democratic Party 's `` new hoax . ''\nIt was n't until a coronavirus task force briefing on March 31 -- the day the U.S. death toll passed 4,000 -- that Trump conceded there would be significant loss of life , after several weeks of comparing the virus to the flu .\nTrump said heeding White House guidance was a `` matter of life or death , frankly '' before tossing to Dr. Deborah Birx , the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator , who displayed its model estimating 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die .\nWhile the president said it was `` very sobering '' to see that 100,000 was the predicted minimum death toll , he also said that it was still `` a very low number . ''\nAt the time , even the government 's top expert of infectious diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci said he hoped the U.S. would not hit 100,000 lives but that `` as sobering a number as that is , we should be prepared for it . ''\nVice President Mike Pence gestures to a monitor as speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House , Tuesday , March 31 , 2020 , in Washington . Alex Brandon/AP\nNot even two weeks after that news conference , Trump cast doubt that the U.S. death toll would reach 100,000 lives , a point he repeated throughout the month of April at least seven times , growing more definitive with each mention .\nAt the start of the month , Trump said , `` I think we 'll be substantially under that number , '' when asked about the White House task force minimum prediction of 100,000 deaths , and by the end of April , he insisted the country would be `` far below '' that prediction .\nOn April 20 , for example , as the death toll toppled 40,000 , Trump claimed he heard the U.S. death toll could end up at 50 or 60,000 , appearing to prematurely declare a victory of sorts -- citing figures well below what he called `` the low number '' estimate of 100,000 .\n`` We did the right thing , because if we did n't do it , you would have had a million people , a million and a half people , maybe two million people dead . Now , we 're going toward 50 , I 'm hearing , or 60,000 people , '' the president said . `` That 's at the lower -- as you know , the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people . We could end up at 50 to 60 . ''\nOn April 29 , Trump raised his prediction to 70,000 as potential for `` the final level '' -- the same day his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner called the federal government 's response a `` great success story . ''\n`` If we did n't do what we did , you would have had a million people die , maybe more , maybe 2 million people die , '' Trump said April 29 . `` And if you think that we 'd be at 65 , or 70 , or 60 , or whatever the final level would be , '' Trump said .\nAnd when that number was surpassed on May 1 and the U.S. neared 65,000 deaths , Trump suggested the country would still come in below 100,000 , again citing the London Imperial College projection .\n`` Not long ago , models predicted that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people would have died in the United States without the mitigation , '' Trump said , adding , `` We have saved thousands and thousands of lives . ''\n`` And hopefully , we 're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost , which is a horrible number nevertheless . It 's a horrible thing . It could 've been stopped . It should 've been stopped at source , but it was n't , '' the president said , blaming China .\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus response during a meeting with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington , April 30 , 2020 . Carlos Barria/Reuters\nJust days later , in a `` virtual town hall '' with Fox News as the country 's death toll neared 68,000 , Trump threw out several numbers , saying the U.S. is `` going to lose anywhere from 75 , 80 to 100,000 people . ''\nWhen pressed on how that number had changed from when he once predicted 60,000 deaths , Trump said , `` And now I 'm saying 80 or 90 . ''\n`` But it 's still going to be , no matter how you look at it , at the very lower end of the plane , '' he continued .\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News `` World News Tonight '' Anchor David Muir on May 6 , Trump did acknowledge the toll could be higher than 70,000 , but again said it could have been much worse , by comparison .\nPresident Donald Trump speaks with ABC News ' David Muir in Phoenix on May 5 , 2020 . ABC News\n`` The upper number was , as you know , 2.2 million people . And then there are some , some models or charts that showed higher than that . But 2.2 million people . I always felt 60 , 65 , 70 -- as , as horrible as that is -- I mean , you 're talking about filling up Yankee Stadium with death . So I thought it was horrible , but it 's probably going to be somewhat higher than that , '' he said .\nVice President Mike Pence , while talking more openly about the death toll , and expressing more sympathy for the victims , also at times has been too optimistic , saying last month , `` I think by Memorial Day weekend we will have this coronavirus epidemic behind us .
