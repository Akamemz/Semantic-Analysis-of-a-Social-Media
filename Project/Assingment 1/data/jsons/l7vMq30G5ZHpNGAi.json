Human rights groups say Cuban authorities have detained more than 2,500 dissidents in the past year , including 50 of the so-called Ladies in White who were rounded up after Mass on Palm Sunday , shortly before Mr. Obama \u2019 s arrival .\nThe president said he had a \u201c frank and candid \u201d discussion about human rights privately with Mr. Castro and told the Cuban leader that progress on human rights would help persuade Congress to lift its economic embargo against Havana and lead to a \u201c full flowering \u201d of relations between the countries .\n\u201c I made it clear that the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of democracy . \u2026 We \u2019 ll speak out on behalf of universal human rights , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nThe president and many lawmakers in both parties favor lifting the embargo , but Republican congressional leaders say the repressive Cuban regime hasn \u2019 t earned the right to full trade benefits with the U.S .\nThe meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro had the appearance of something that Mr. Obama had to get out of the way during the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to the island since 1928 . The president will speak directly to the Cuban people Tuesday morning in a speech that will be carried live on Cuban TV .\nThe trip is focused on encouraging more business ties between the U.S. and Cuba , such as hotel development , tourism , agricultural cooperation and Google \u2019 s announcement that it would help improve Wi-Fi and broadband access on the island .\nBut Mr. Castro was determined to use his appearance with Mr. Obama to point out perceived failures of democracy in the U.S. and to essentially call Americans hypocrites for criticizing conditions in Cuba .\nContrasting the communist system with the U.S. , Mr. Castro said , \u201c We have many other rights \u2014 a right to health , the right to education . In Cuba , women get [ the ] same pay for same work . We can not use the argument of human rights for political confrontation . That is not fair .\n\u201c We find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and ensure the right to health care , education , Social Security with provision and development , equal pay and the rights of children , \u201d Mr. Castro said .\nOn the subject of the naval base , which the U.S. has held since the Spanish-American War in 1898 , Mr. Castro demanded that Mr. Obama give it back to Cuba .\n\u201c In order to move forward towards normalization , it will also be necessary to return the territory illegally occupied by Guantanamo Naval Base , \u201d Mr. Castro said , calling it one of the \u201c main obstacles \u201d to normalizing relations .\nMr. Obama never mentioned Guantanamo publicly , and some Republicans in Congress , including presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , are concerned that Mr. Obama does want to turn over the naval base to Cuba .\nGitmo is home to the military prison where the U.S. is still holding 91 terrorism detainees . Mr. Obama wants to close the prison and transfer many of the detainees to prisons on the U.S. mainland .\nWhite House aides have said the president has no plans to hand over the naval base to Cuba .\n\u201c It \u2019 s normal for them to raise Guantanamo , \u201d said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes . \u201c We \u2019 ve made very clear that \u2019 s not on the table . \u201d\nBut Rep. Mike Pompeo , Kansas Republican , said in an op-ed Monday that he is \u201c deeply concerned that Obama may also give the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cubans in order to placate them . \u201d\n\u201c This would be a strategic blunder that would haunt us for decades and leave the American homeland exposed , \u201d said Mr. Pompeo , an outspoken opponent of the administration \u2019 s plan to transfer detainees to other prisons , including Fort Leavenworth in Kansas .\nMr. Obama tried to deflect Mr. Castro \u2019 s criticisms of the U.S. on Guantanamo and other issues by saying his visit heralded a \u201c new day \u201d in relations with Cuba .\n\u201c Perhaps most importantly , I affirm that Cuba \u2019 s destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c Cuba is sovereign and rightly has great pride , and the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans , not by anybody else . \u201d\nEarlier in the day , Mr. Obama participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Jose Marti memorial , a tribute to the Cuban national hero who fought for independence from Spain in the 19th century . The president was photographed against a mural of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara and was accompanied by Salvador Valdes Mesa , a Cuban leader who participated in the revolution and in repelling the Bay of Pigs invasion organized by the CIA in 1961 .\nDuring the short news conference , Mr. Obama appeared irritated when Mr. Castro interrupted his answer to a reporter \u2019 s question to confer loudly in Spanish with a Cuban aide near the stage .\n\u201c Excuse me ? \u201d Mr. Obama said to Mr. Castro as they stood side by side at lecterns .\nThe Cuban leader explained to Mr. Obama that he was trying to discern whether the American reporter \u2019 s question about political prisoners was intended for him . He then launched into his defense that the regime isn \u2019 t holding any dissidents .\nMr. Obama did succeed in persuading Mr. Castro to take questions from reporters in the first place , which he rarely does .
