Democrats talked about this bill going nowhere . And it \u2019 s really sickening that the Democrats are using this opportunity to enforce their socialism . Remember , what is this bill that they just passed on Friday ? Well , it \u2019 s about pot , it \u2019 s about prisoners , it \u2019 s about politicizing election law , prioritizing illegal immigrants and pensions . These are all things that are socialist wish lists that they \u2019 ve been trying to pass long before COVID ever came to this land .

That is a waste of money . Three trillion dollars that never went through one committee . This was only written in Pelosi \u2019 s office . And they knew it wasn \u2019 t going anywhere . You talk to Democrats . They didn \u2019 t like it . They didn \u2019 t want it .
