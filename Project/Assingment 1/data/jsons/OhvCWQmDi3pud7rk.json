    "content": "President Donald Trump delivered a scorched-earth speech to conservative activists on Saturday , calling the Russia investigation `` bullshit , '' adopting a southern accent to mock his former attorney general , and asserting that some members of Congress `` hate our country . ''\nThe rollicking two-hour-plus appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland offered the president a brief respite from an otherwise miserable week in which his much-touted summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ended in failure and his former personal lawyer delivered explosive testimony to Congress .\nTrump , basking in the adoration of the crowd , largely glossed over the North Korea summit 's collapse , instead reviving several of his greatest hits , from rehashing the 2016 election to obsessing over the crowd size at his inauguration .\nThe speech amounted to a boatload of red meat for conservatives , with Trump promising he \u2019 ll protect them from undocumented immigrants , socialism and liberal Democrats he claims are dead set on bankrupting the country with proposals like the Green New Deal .\n\u201c You know I \u2019 m totally off script right now , \u201d Trump said at the beginning of his speech . As his meandering remarks continued , it became clear that his assessment was an understatement .\nAt one point , Trump regaled the crowd with a story about a general he said was named `` Raisin Caine '' ( it was n't immediately clear who he was referring to ) . He said he always sits with the pilots when airplanes are landing : `` They know what we \u2019 re doing . '' He boasted about his good eyesight and later added , `` I don \u2019 t have white hair . '' He derided a Hawaii senator as a `` crazy person . '' And he accused Hollywood of discriminating against conservatives .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

If you look at that first speech , that was very innocent compared to what \u2019 s happening , '' Trump said . Trump came under fire for his 2015 comments , which appeared to broadly assert that Mexicans were rapists .\nThroughout , Trump again revealed himself to be a president deeply scorned by what he views as unfair media coverage and a lack of recognition from many in Washington . `` I get no credit , '' he said multiple times throughout the lengthy speech .\nHe also insisted that nobody had left the speech early , but journalists present reported that in fact , some attendees were seen departing before the close of his remarks .\nLater , the president sounded off on the 2020 election , expressing regret that he attacked Sen. Elizabeth Warren so early . `` I should have saved the Pocahontas thing for another year , '' he said . `` I \u2019 ve destroyed her political career and I won \u2019 t get a chance to run against her and I would have loved that . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s remarks overlapped with Sen.

At one point , the president wrapped his arms around an American flag on the stage , holding the hug for a moment as he mugged for the cameras .\n\u201c I \u2019 m in love , you \u2019 re in love and we \u2019 re all in love together , '' the president declared .\nThough Trump did n't linger long on his North Korea summit , he suggested at the end of his remarks that he publicly took Kim at his word about Otto Warmbier 's death in order to salvage a possible denuclearization deal . Trump said he was in `` such a horrible position because in one way I have to negotiate , and in another way I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier and I love Otto and it \u2019 s a very delicate balance . \u201d\nThe president repeatedly took aim at Democrats in Congress . `` We have people in Congress that hate our country , '' he said . `` You know that , we can name every one of them . They hate our country . '' He then bashed the Green New Deal , jokingly encouraging liberals to keep pushing it because it would benefit him politically . `` They should stay with that argument , '' he said . `` Never change . \u201d\nTrump revived his divisive immigration rhetoric . `` They don \u2019 t like it when I say it , but we are being invaded , '' he said . He disputed government statistics showing that undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born American citizens , calling the data false propaganda '' and citing no evidence to support his claim .\nThe president also discussed his infamous 2016 appeal to Russia to hack Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , arguing that he was just joking and criticizing the press for taking his comments seriously .\n\u201c So everybody is having a good time , I \u2019 m laughing , we \u2019 re all having fun . Then that fake CNN and others say , \u2018 He asked Russia to go get the emails . Horrible , \u2019 \u201d Trump said , adding , \u201c These people are sick , and I \u2019 m telling you , they know the game and they play it dirty , dirtier than anybody has ever played the game . \u201d\nTrump is still under fire for his 2016 campaign plea to Russia , in which he appeared to ask the foreign power to recover the emails from Clinton \u2019 s private email server when she was secretary of State . \u201c Russia , if you \u2019 re listening , I hope you \u2019 re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing , \u201d Trump said in July 2016 . \u201c I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press . \u201d\nProsecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller later said that Russian spies began trying to hack into Clinton \u2019 s server after Trump \u2019 s plea .\nThe president seemed fixated on the Mueller probe and the other investigations that are aimed at the people in his inner circle .\n`` All of a sudden , they are trying to take you out with bullshit , '' Trump said to raucous applause from the crowd .\n`` Now Robert Mueller never received a vote and neither did the person that appointed him and as you know , the attorney general said , ' I \u2019 m going to recuse myself , \u201d Trump continued , putting on a southern accent and mocking former Attorney General Jeff Sessions . `` And I said \u2018 Why the hell didn \u2019 t he tell me that before I put him in ? ' ''\nHe also railed against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , who has intensified his panel 's scrutiny of Trump 's business dealings .\n`` I saw a little Shifty Schiff yesterday , '' Trump said . `` He went into a meeting . He said , 'We are going to look into his finances . ' Where did that come from ? He always talked about Russia . The collusion delusion .
