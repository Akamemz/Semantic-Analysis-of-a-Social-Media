    "content": "A federal judge ruled Monday that President Trump \u2019 s phaseout of the Obama-era DACA program is legal , adding heft to the administration \u2019 s defense but doing little to solve the ongoing court quagmire .\nThe ruling does not overturn two other federal courts , who had previously blocked the phaseout , which was supposed to take effect Monday . But it does offer a needed boost as the Justice Department appeals those other two rulings .\nJudge Roger W. Titus , a Bush appointee to the bench in Maryland , said the judges in California and New York who blocked the phaseout attempted to substitute their own judgments for that of the Homeland Security Department , crossing constitutional lines in order to strike at Mr. Trump \u2019 s policies .\nJudge Titus went even further , praising the Trump administration for the way it handled the situation with a six-month phaseout .\n\u201c This decision took control of a pell-mell situation and provided Congress \u2014 the branch of government charged with determining immigration policy \u2014 an opportunity to remedy it . Given the reasonable belief that DACA was unlawful , the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner was rational , \u201d the judge wrote .\nDACA is the 2012 program Mr. Obama created , using executive authority , to protect hundreds of thousands of \u201c Dreamers \u201d from deportation and to give them a foothold in society . Some 683,000 people were being protected as of Jan. 31 .\nBut the program was always legally questionable , and Mr. Trump last September , facing threats of lawsuits from Texas and other states , announced his phaseout , with a final deadline of March 5 .\nImmigrant-rights groups across the country objected , and many of them sued , with at least five cases in California , two in New York , one in Washington , D.C. , and one in Maryland .\nThe judge in the California case ruled in January , imposing a nationwide halt on the phaseout in an expansive opinion blasting the administration for its handling . A judge in the New York cases last month issued a more carefully crafted ruling but reached the same conclusion that the DACA program itself is legal as Mr. Obama wrote it , and that the Trump administration didn \u2019 t give a good enough justification for its phaseout , making it arbitrary .\nJudge Titus , though , said the administration was facing a credible legal threat from Texas , and the attorney general had doubts about mounting a defense , so the Homeland Security Department \u2019 s decision was not arbitrary .\nHe also took on those who said Mr. Trump \u2019 s past comments about illegal immigrants soured the case .\n\u201c As disheartening or inappropriate as the president \u2019 s occasionally disparaging remarks may be , they are not relevant to the larger issues governing the DACA rescission .
