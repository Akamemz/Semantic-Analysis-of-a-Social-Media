Mary Wilson\nIn a year when the Democratic base is highly energised and the 21st \u2019 s Republican incumbent , Lamar Smith , is retiring , the district is a test case for whether Democratic prospects are best served by a candidate who can inspire exceptional turnout from liberals or one that could woo moderate crossover Republicans , disturbed by the party \u2019 s direction under Donald Trump .\nWilson , a minister and former math teacher , believes that the Washington establishment , in the form of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , favours her runoff rival , Joseph Kopser , a decorated army veteran and entrepreneur with endorsements from a number of party figures . The DCCC has not officially endorsed a candidate in the race .\n\u201c How did I , this lifelong Democrat , become that \u2018 anti-establishment \u2019 candidate ? \u201d she asked . \u201c Well , I became that because the DCCC decided they liked my opponent \u2019 s story , they thought somehow he can win , and lo and behold he [ raised ] nearly $ 800,000 on a primary and came in second and didn \u2019 t even break 30 % of the vote .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know why then we should consider him to be the most viable candidate to win in November when he couldn \u2019 t win in March with every advantage .
