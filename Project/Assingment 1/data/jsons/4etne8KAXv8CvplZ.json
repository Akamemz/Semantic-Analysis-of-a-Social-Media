    "content": "President Obama and Governor Romney battled to a draw on foreign policy points tonight , with each candidate scoring on several lines . As expected , the discussion meandered into domestic policy for a large portion of the evening , and both men came prepared with a flurry of talking points . Romney needed to strike casual viewers are informed , poised , and plausible as president . He accomplished that task , without question . The president often seemed like the aggressor , hammering his challenger in almost every answer he gave . Romney coolly chided Obama , explaining that attacking him ( especially dishonestly ) does n't advance any solutions . The candidates found themselves in general agreement on a number of fronts ( Syria , Iran sanctions , etc ) , leading to smaller skirmishes over who would have done what sooner , or more forcefully . Romney 's strongest answers came on the state of the economy and the debt -- as well as on Israel and the so-called `` apology tour . '' He closed very well . The president told a very touching anecdote about meeting a 9/11 orphan , and repeatedly reminded Americans that he is the Commander-in-Chief , often emphasizing the word `` me , '' or `` I . '' On the whole , Obama turned in a strong performance , even if he failed to bait Romney into the more heated exchanges he appeared to crave . Romney executed a clear strategy : Pass the `` eye test , '' challenge the president where necessary , and project strength without striking war-weary Americans as unduly bellicose . Success . I would not be surprised to see the snap polls tilt toward the sitting president tonight , but this was in no way a game-changing event ; advantage Romney . Stay tuned for updates ...\nUPDATE - Two early fact-checks : On a disagreement over forces remaining in Iraq , Romney was right , and Obama was wrong , according to CNN and the New York Times . On the auto industry flare-up , the last two paragraphs of this Times story back up Romney 's contentions , as well .\nUPDATE II - CBS ' instant poll gives a substantial advantage to Obama , 53-23 , with 24 percent calling it a tie .\nUPDATE III - On CNN , conventional wisdom maven David Gergen says Romney `` passed the Commander-in-Chief test : ''\nUPDATE IV - Many people are giving atta-boys to moderator Bob Schieffer .
