We have to bring unity . \u201d\nFriday brought another day of incredible division and revolt with Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham falling in line not behind Trump , but behind House Speaker Paul Ryan , who said a day earlier that he can not yet support the brash real estate mogul as his party \u2019 s standard-bearer .\nHe fired off a vicious statement , calling Graham an \u201c embarrassment \u201d with \u201c zero credibility . \u201d\nThen he laced into both of his former rivals during his rally in Omaha , Nebraska , where he is continuing to campaign ahead of Tuesday \u2019 s primary , despite having vanquished the rest of the GOP field .\n\u201c But I won \u2019 t talk about Jeb Bush . I will not say \u2014 I will not say he \u2019 s low energy . I will not say it , \u201d Trump told a boisterous crowd who booed at the mention of his critics . \u201c I will not say it . And I won \u2019 t talk about Lindsey Graham , who had like 1 point , you ever see this guy on television ? He is nasty . \u2026 He leaves a disgrace , he can \u2019 t represent the people of South Carolina well . \u201d\nTrump also alternated on Friday between shrugging off Ryan \u2019 s bombshell announcement and scorching him .\nDuring a phone interview with Fox News , Trump said he was \u201c very , very surprised \u201d at Ryan \u2019 s comments . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to believe , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t bother me at all . \u201d\n\u201c So many great endorsements yesterday , except for Paul Ryan ! \u201d Trump tweeted . \u201c We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ! \u201d\nRoughly 90 minutes later , Trump came back with a sharp critique of another comment Ryan made Thursday . \u201c Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special , the Republican Party .
