But only if she can vote for Bernie Sanders .\nThe 19-year-old , who studies political science and lives in the Bronx , said the Vermont senator is the only candidate she trusts to deal with the issues she cares most about \u2013 on climate change , for instance , she called former vice-president Joe Biden \u2019 s plan \u201c unfeasible \u201d . A vote for Biden , who is likely to be the Democratic nominee in November , would only give the party more reason to take her vote for granted , she said .\n\u201c If we lose to Trump then hopefully within the next four years maybe an AOC or Rashida Tlaib would be able to run , \u201d Okonkwo said , referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and another progressive politician who has gained popularity in the last two years . \u201c Maybe there would be a better chance to save the planet . \u201d\nOkonkwo is not alone in her unequivocal and uncompromising support for Sanders . She is part of a loosely connected but vocal group , sometimes uniting under hashtags like # BernieorBust or # NeverBiden who say they will not vote for Biden if he wins the nomination . While it \u2019 s nearly impossible to know how large the group is , hundreds of people have shared this sentiment , including progressive political candidates .\nIt may be impossible to quantify their number , but not their influence . Those Democrats who will not yield to a moderate and vote for Biden if he wins the nomination are the same group who are sometimes blamed for Donald Trump \u2019 s victory in 2016 when disappointed Sanders fans sat out the general election .\nAnd the past few weeks have been hard to swallow for Sanders fans . After a strong early showing in Iowa , Nevada and New Hampshire his star faded on Super Tuesday . Supporters were left disappointed again this week when he lost to Biden in Michigan , where he edged out Hillary Clinton in 2016 . This poor performance is partly due to an unexpectedly weak youth vote \u2013 despite Sanders \u2019 vaunted ability to mobilise younger Americans .\nAs the Sanders campaign reckons with the fallout , and former Democratic candidates rush to endorse Biden , the # BernieorBust fans are grappling with a repeat of 2016 . It \u2019 s hard to tell how their decision could affect the election , but in 2016 , a similar group of people who boycotted Hillary Clinton on election day contributed to her loss in swing states like Florida , where more than 200,000 people voted for independent candidates such as Gary Johnson or Jill Stein .\n\u201c If you distrust something , you are more likely to opt out of it , \u201d said Rashawn Ray , a governance fellow at the Brookings Institution . And Sanders supporters don \u2019 t trust the Democratic party . \u201c They think its political sabotage , and not allowing Bernie to have a fair shot . So what do people do ? They opt out . \u201d\nMartha Baez , a 54-year-old who works in finance , is one of those voters . She is registered as an independent and voted for Jill Stein in 2016 . \u201c There was failure in getting me out to the polls with the \u2018 lesser of two evils \u2019 theory \u201d , she said of the argument that whatever Clinton \u2019 s perceived flaws , she was better than Trump .\nThis year , Baez is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary , and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November . But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate , but losing trust in the Democratic party . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear , \u201d she said . \u201c The DNC needs an overhaul , it lacks values , real leaders that represent the people not its donors . \u201d\nThe impact on the supreme court or other policies , she said , was not her responsibility .\n\u201c Why is that my problem ? \u201d she said . \u201c Shouldn \u2019 t it have been considered before selecting the \u2018 chosen one \u2019 ? Will they try and flip the script and make it my issue or fault ? \u201d\nJessica Wright , an avid Sanders supporter in east Texas , tweeted that she was # BernieorBust after his Super Tuesday defeat in her state . She said she was angry that other Democratic candidates had dropped out just before the big primary day to endorse Joe Biden , and wanted the \u201c so-called Democratic establishment \u201d to know they were letting down people like her .\nWright , 37 , works at a hospital and said she and her husband live paycheck to paycheck . She said Sanders \u2019 policies would be the best for her family , including family members married to immigrants struggling to gain citizenship status in the US . But given that a Trump election could be worse , and herald new conservative court appointees and other harmful policies , she is still considering voting for Biden , or at the very least , voting down ballot in other , non-presidential races on election day .\n\u201c For me not voting would be to send a message : what you \u2019 ve done is not OK , \u201d Wright said . \u201c I wish there was a way to vote for [ Biden ] and still send that message . \u201d\nStephen Ansolabehere , a Harvard government professor who studies political campaigns , said there is a similar \u201c sour grapes \u201d group during every election , even if it \u2019 s not a big enough group to swing the result . But he said what determines whether or not Sanders supporters will show up for Biden depends on how the latter treats them in the coming months .\n\u201c When you lose [ your candidate ] it \u2019 s like a death in the family , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s the bitterness of the emotions . Biden knows that bitterness so he could be empathetic and bring those people back to the fold. \u201d He gave the example of the 1988 Democratic primary , when frontrunner Michael Dukakis reached a compromise with his opponent Jesse Jackson by changing party rules to tie the delegate vote more closely to the popular vote , giving Jackson a partial victory .\nAnsolabehere also pointed out that Sanders \u2019 progressive movement relies heavily on young people going to the polls . But even if they are politically engaged , this subset of voters consistently deals with more hurdles to register to vote because of restrictive voting policies around address changes and identification .
