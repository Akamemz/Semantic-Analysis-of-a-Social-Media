    "content": "Cambridge Analytica , a political consulting firm that did digital work for Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign in 2016 , is reportedly shutting down after recent ethical and legal questions about its business practices .\nThe Wall Street Journal \u2019 s Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross report that both Cambridge and its British parent company , SCL Group , will disband amid a growing series of scandals .\nIn March , the New York Times and Observer reported that Cambridge obtained private Facebook data \u2014 specifically , information on tens of millions of Facebook profiles \u2014 from an outside researcher who provided it to them in violation of his own agreement with Facebook .\n\u201c We believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people \u2014 mostly in the US \u2014 may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica , \u201d Facebook \u2019 s chief technology officer wrote .\nAround the same time , Channel 4 News in the UK posted video in which Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix says his firm conducts dirty tricks such as trying to tape its candidates \u2019 opponents accepting purported bribes or sending \u201c some girls around to the [ opposing ] candidate \u2019 s house . \u201d\nEven before all this , though , Cambridge was under scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election \u2014 both because Nix contacted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks that summer to discuss hacked Democratic emails and because of broader questions about whether Trump \u2019 s digital operation collaborated with Russians in some way . ( An ABC News report says Mueller \u2019 s team has been interviewing witnesses about the campaign \u2019 s digital team this year . )\nAnd while all this was going on , there \u2019 s also been a heated debate in the political world about just what in the world Cambridge Analytica even does \u2014 and whether it \u2019 s useful .\nWas it an ingenious , sinister operation that harnessed big data to power Donald Trump to victory ? Or was it \u2014 as many who \u2019 ve worked with the firm claim \u2014 sort of a joke ? Or something in between ?\nCambridge Analytica began with a British PR firm that \u2019 s been around for decades\nBefore there was Cambridge Analytica , there was the Strategic Communication Laboratories Group \u2014 SCL Group , for short . Founded in 1993 by a British ad man named Nigel Oakes , it is , basically , a messaging and PR firm that \u2019 s done work for governments , politicians , and militaries around the world . Its clients included governments and politicians in Indonesia , Thailand , Kenya , the UK , and elsewhere .\nSCL tends to describe its capabilities in grandiose and somewhat unsettling language \u2014 the company has touted its expertise at \u201d psychological warfare \u201d and \u201c influence operations. \u201d It \u2019 s long claimed that its sophisticated understanding of human psychology helps it target and persuade people of its clients \u2019 preferred message . Lately , its preferred buzzwords have focused on \u201c big data \u201d and \u201c psychographic profiling . \u201d\nYet articles from the Wall Street Journal and the Independent on SCL \u2019 s work circa 1999 and 2000 describe what sound like relatively standard political messaging and PR work for the Thai and Indonesian regimes , alongside a penchant for secrecy and ethically questionable activities .\nThe stories allege , for instance , that SCL tried to place a story in an Indonesian paper based on a purported government document that was apparently fake , and how it repeatedly tried to operate through front and shell groups while obscuring where its funds were coming from . SCL also did more standard things like summarizing news reports for its clients and placing TV ads .\nPerhaps most instructive is that both reports describe how in Thailand and Indonesia , SCL set up operations centers full of computers and TV screens that were designed to look quite impressive . Per the Observer , these rooms looked much like the villain \u2019 s computer-filled complex from the 1995 James Bond film Goldeneye . ( And in fact , SCL hired the company that made that Goldeneye film set to put together a similar ops center . )\nWhat those fancy facilities were actually used for , though , was far less clear . The Independent wrote that \u201c its primary function appears to have been cosmetic , \u201d and quoted an Indonesian source calling it \u201c just like a movie set to impress the clients . \u201d\nSome of SCL \u2019 s operations ended badly \u2014 the Indonesian president the firm worked for was deposed , and the Thai contract concluded with a falling-out and local reports that Oakes had violated the country \u2019 s immigration laws . Nevertheless , Oakes and SCL proved remarkably adept at convincing new clients to write them big checks .\nAfter 9/11 , the firm began to tout its alleged expertise at anti-terrorism and anti-jihadist messaging at a time when Western governments were eager to pay for such work . ( \u201c Psych-ops was big business and people were just chucking money around , \u201d a source told the Observer . )\nAnd finally , in 2013 , SCL found a wealthy American who \u2019 d give it a great deal of money indeed .\nSteve Bannon and the Mercer family worked with the Brits to found Cambridge Analytica\nAround 2013 , word of SCL \u2019 s work reached the ears of Steve Bannon \u2014 and he was intrigued . Bannon was then running Breitbart News , but perhaps more importantly , he was a trusted political adviser to Robert and Rebekah Mercer , the father-daughter pair of conservative megadonors . Bannon connected SCL with the Mercers , and the British firm pitched a major expansion of its operation into US politics .\nSCL claimed to be able to do a new type of political targeting that would be based on modeling individuals \u2019 personalities ( rather than just demographic traits like age , race , or gender , as is traditional ) . It would do so based on survey questions that measure the Big Five or \u201c OCEAN \u201d personality traits commonly used in psychology research \u2014 Openness , Conscientiousness , Extroversion , Agreeableness , and Neuroticism . ( You can take the test here . )\nIt would also use modeling to extrapolate the personalities of people it didn \u2019 t directly survey . Then , SCL claimed , it could tailor messaging to better target and persuade voters based on their particular personalities . This , SCL said , was the future of politics .\nThe Mercers agreed to provide $ 15 million for this project . To do so , they set up a new company mostly owned by Robert Mercer , with SCL Group executive Alexander Nix as the CEO . It would be named Cambridge Analytica ( a name reportedly provided by Bannon , who would also have a stake in the company and serve as a vice president ) . But according to the New York Times , Cambridge was \u201c effectively a shell , \u201d and all its contract work would be carried out by the SCL Group .\nAt the core of this new effort would be a vast amount of data that an outside researcher harvested from tens of millions of people \u2019 s Facebook profiles \u2014 an effort Cambridge Analytica reportedly funded to the tune of $ 7 million . The data was matched with other records to construct personality profiles on millions of American voters , in hopes that Cambridge could better target them with customized political messaging .\nIn GOP political consulting circles , Cambridge soon gained a reputation as the Mercers \u2019 somewhat odd pet project . The wealthy hedge fund family would reportedly demand that candidates hire Cambridge if they wanted Mercer money . And after working on various low-profile GOP political efforts in 2014 , Cambridge landed a major job with a Mercer-funded Super PAC supporting Ted Cruz \u2019 s presidential candidacy . But the gig went poorly \u2014 the Cruz team claimed Cambridge \u2019 s data was worthless and fought with them over money , according to a later New York Times report .\nCambridge beefed up Donald Trump \u2019 s digital operation for the 2016 general election\nEventually , Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee-in-waiting . And though Bannon was still a few months away from officially joining the Trump campaign , he made the introduction between Cambridge and Trump \u2019 s team . ( Bannon owned a stake in Cambridge and was being paid by it at the time . ) Various reports name Trump staffers Paul Manafort , Jared Kushner , and Brad Parscale as involved in the decision to bring Cambridge on board , and on June 23 , 2016 , the campaign signed a contract with the firm .\nTrump \u2019 s digital team was run by Parscale out of an office in San Antonio , Texas , and Cambridge sent along 13 people to work with them there , Wired reported .\nWhat did they do ? Well , in the new Channel 4 News report , Nix , the Cambridge CEO , brags to someone he thought was a prospective client that \u201c we did all the research , all the data , all the analytics , all the targeting , we ran all the digital campaign , the television campaign , and our data informed all the strategy \u201d ( though he could be inflating the company \u2019 s role ) .\nHowever , one thing that both Trump aides and Cambridge staffers have since claimed the company did not do for Trump is use the firm \u2019 s fancy , futuristic-sounding \u201c psychographic \u201d personality modeling . People from both camps have said , in public statements and to reporters , that the Trump campaign chose to use the RNC \u2019 s data file as its raw data , not those tens of millions of personal profiles matched with Facebook data that Cambridge obtained .\nIf this is true , Cambridge \u2019 s work for Trump resembled less sexy , more traditional political consulting . More specifically :\nCambridge oversaw a $ 5 million placement of TV ads \u2014 though the Times reports that the Trump campaign was unhappy with the results , since Cambridge ended up paying for ads on cable channels in Washington , DC .\nThe firm worked on targeting digital ads and online fundraising .\nHowever , it should also be noted that , at the same time , other Cambridge employees were working for the Mercer-backed Super PAC \u201c Make America Number 1 \u201d that was supporting Trump . This work , they say , was firewalled off from Trump \u2019 s campaign ( as it legally has to to be ) .\nIn the end , Federal Election Commission filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge $ 5.9 million over the rest of the campaign , and the Wall Street Journal reported that $ 3 million more went to Cambridge through Parscale \u2019 s firm .\nDuring the campaign , Trump \u2019 s digital operation was generally thought to be a joke , and Clinton \u2019 s team was portrayed as the ingenious data wizards with incredible algorithms . But after Clinton \u2019 s shocking loss , people naturally searched for explanations \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica was willing and eager to take credit . Not everyone bought it , though \u2014 the Spectator \u2019 s Paul Wood asked \u201c Are Cambridge Analytica brilliant scientists or snake-oil salesmen ? \u201d in December 2016 .\nOf late , though , Cambridge has faced a new round of scrutiny over just how it got all that Facebook data in the first place \u2014 and Facebook , too , is facing major questions about what happened .\nThe Guardian actually broke much of this story all the way back in December 2015 , when Cambridge was still backing Cruz \u2019 s presidential campaign . But in March 2018 , a former Cambridge employee , Christopher Wylie , provided documents and first-person testimony in both a Times story ( by Matthew Rosenberg , Nick Confessore , and Carole Cadwalladr ) and an Observer story ( by Cadwalladr ) laying out , in far more detail , exactly what happened .\nAleksandr Kogan , a Russian-American academic at Cambridge University , got permission from Facebook to pull data via an app he created \u2014 but he reportedly claimed he \u2019 d use this data only for academic purposes , not commercial ones .\nKogan \u2019 s app , \u201c thisismydigitallife , \u201d was a personality quiz Facebook users could take . However , to take the quiz , users had to consent to give the app access to their and their friends \u2019 Facebook profiles .\nMore than 270,000 people used the app and took the quiz . However , because they consented to give the app access to their friends \u2019 profiles , too , Kogan ended up collecting data from far more . Initially , the estimate was 50 million raw profiles , of which about 30 million could be matched with other records that helped identify people . Now , Facebook says 87 million users \u2019 profiles \u201c may have been improperly shared \u201d with Cambridge .\nCambridge Analytica was the brains behind Kogan \u2019 s operation and ended up spending about $ 7 million on this data , Wylie told the Observer . ( It also seems that Bannon gave the new company its name because of all this , since Kogan worked at Cambridge University . )\nFacebook says it learned that Kogan had violated its rules by passing on the information to third parties in 2015 and that it subsequently got assurances from Kogan and Cambridge that they deleted the data they \u2019 d collected . However , a former Cambridge employee told the Times that \u201c he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes \u201d of that data still on the company \u2019 s servers .\nBoth Facebook and Cambridge have faced enormous criticism for all this , and as the news was about to break , Facebook announced it would suspend Cambridge , SCL Group , Kogan , and Wylie from its platform .\nHowever , despite Wylie \u2019 s dramatic claims that he and Cambridge \u201c broke Facebook , \u201d the harvesting of such data , even from users \u2019 friends who didn \u2019 t clearly consent , does seem to have been clearly allowed by Facebook at the time , and many app developers had similar practices . Indeed , Zeynep Tufekci argues that this is an \u201c all-too-natural consequence of Facebook \u2019 s business model , \u201d since the company makes money \u201c by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers , political actors and others . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not clear whether any laws were broken here \u2014 Andrew Keane Woods runs down some possibilities at Lawfare \u2014 but regulators in the US and the UK both say they \u2019 re looking into the matter .\nImportantly , it hasn \u2019 t been shown Cambridge used this Facebook profile info in its work for the Trump campaign . ( Wylie left the firm in late 2014 , so he can \u2019 t speak to that . )\nAlso , apropos of nothing , Aleksandr Kogan at one point changed his name to \u201c Dr . Spectre , \u201d but then changed it back .\nCambridge \u2019 s CEO bragged about doing shady stuff to someone he thought was a potential client\nShortly after Wylie came forward publicly , Channel 4 News in the UK began to publish a series that was the result of a four-month investigation it conducted into Cambridge Analytica .\nChannel 4 got a reporter to pose as a wealthy Sri Lankan interested in influencing politics in his home country \u2014 and secretly taped Cambridge executives , including eventually CEO Alexander Nix , as they pitched their services to him in a series of meetings .\nIt was Nix , hoping to close the deal , who said the most attention-getting things . He said the company operates \u201c in the shadows \u201d and that he looks forward \u201c to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you. \u201d He said that his company could have an operative try to videotape a politician they want to discredit accepting a bribe . \u201c They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate , to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance , \u201d Nix said . \u201c We \u2019 ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras . \u201d\nAnother possibility , Nix continued , was to \u201c send some girls around to the candidate \u2019 s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things. \u201d He elaborated , \u201c We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us , \u201d since they \u2019 re \u201c very beautiful. \u201d However , he did go on to say , \u201c Please don \u2019 t pay too much attention to what I \u2019 m saying because I \u2019 m just giving you examples of what can be done and what , what has been done. \u201d Nix also told the supposed prospective client that he uses an email service called ProtonMail and sets it to delete all his mail two hours after it \u2019 s read , so there will be no \u201c paper trail . \u201d\nAs the Atlantic \u2019 s David Graham notes , dirty tricks like these don \u2019 t really have anything to do with big data or psychographic personality profiling . They make Cambridge sound rather more like an ordinary political consulting firm from the shadier side of the business . In any case , Nix \u2019 s comments to Channel 4 have created enough of an uproar that Cambridge said it \u2019 s suspending him pending an investigation . ( What that means for Nix \u2019 s position at SCL Group is not yet clear . )\nCambridge Analytica \u2019 s CEO also reached out to Julian Assange in search of hacked Democratic emails\nYet the new reports aren \u2019 t the only reason Cambridge is under scrutiny . One of the central focuses of special counsel Mueller \u2019 s investigation is whether anyone on Trump \u2019 s team had inside knowledge about or played any role in the hacking and leaking of prominent Democrats \u2019 emails in 2016 .\nAnd we learned last year , via reporting from the Wall Street Journal \u2019 s Rebecca Ballhaus , that Nix \u2014 Cambridge \u2019 s CEO \u2014 had contacted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about just that topic , both just before and after Cambridge signed on with the Trump campaign .\nThere \u2019 s no evidence yet that Nix \u2019 s contacts with Assange actually led to anything . But here \u2019 s the timeline of what we know happened :\nIn mid-May 2016 , Cambridge began discussions with Trump \u2019 s team about work for the campaign .\nOn June 12 , 2016 , WikiLeaks \u2019 Julian Assange publicly claimed to have \u201c upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton , \u201d which he specified were \u201c emails . \u201d\nNix says that it was after he saw this report , in \u201c early June , \u201d that he reached out to Assange to ask if he could get an advance look at those emails . He says that Assange turned him down .\nAt some point that same month , Cambridge board member Rebekah Mercer talked with an associate about whether they should try to somehow obtain Hillary Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails , a source told Ballhaus . ( Clinton deleted about 33,000 emails , about half of the total on her server , rather than turn them over to the government because she said they were personal rather than work-related . ) Ballhaus \u2019 s source claimed Mercer decided not to go through with this .\nOn June 13 , 2016 , Cambridge sent a proposed contract to Trump \u2019 s team .\nOn June 23 , 2016 , the Trump campaign signed a contract with Cambridge to do digital work .\nOn July 22 , 2016 , WikiLeaks began posting hacked DNC emails .\nIn August 2016 , Nix emailed Mercer and other Cambridge employees and said that he \u2019 d recently reached out to Assange again , and offered to help better organize the WikiLeaks-posted DNC emails , but hadn \u2019 t yet heard back .\nBoth Nix and Assange have said , however , that these overtures never went anywhere . No evidence has emerged to disprove them . Still , this is yet another addition to the list of Trump associates who betrayed at least some interest in getting involved with hacked Democratic emails ( and we should keep in mind that the email hackings themselves were a crime ) .\nThere have been also questions about whether Trump \u2019 s data operation worked with Russia\nFinally , separately from Nix \u2019 s contacts with Assange , there have been questions for months about whether the Trump campaign \u2019 s data operation collaborated with Russian digital efforts to boost Trump or hurt Clinton in some way .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in December that Mueller had requested Cambridge turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on Trump \u2019 s campaign . And anonymously sourced reports from McClatchy and Vanity Fair , among others , have said Mueller \u2019 s team is looking into whether Trump \u2019 s digital operation provided information to Russians to help them determine which American voters to target with their own digital efforts .\nAs of now , there is no evidence that this occurred , and Mueller \u2019 s recent indictment of several Russian individuals and companies for conspiring to interfere with the election through their propaganda work makes no allegations that anyone on Trump \u2019 s team was aware of their activities .\nBut since Cambridge was a major part of Trump \u2019 s digital operation , there are some questions about them and their own ties to Russia .\nThe firm has also claimed to have done work in Russia and Ukraine in the past .\nAleksandr Kogan , who provided that Facebook data , is also an associate professor at St. Petersburg University and got a grant from the Russian government to research social networks .\nCambridge at one point tried to land business from the Russian oil and gas company Lukoil .\nDays after WikiLeaks began posting the DNC emails and at the height of the 2016 campaign , Nix was photographed on a polo field with the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom , according to Mother Jones .\nAnother odd note is that toward the end of the campaign , Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn signed on to do consulting for the SCL Group . It is not clear what , if anything , Flynn did for them . However , and perhaps unrelatedly , some reports have suggested that Flynn was involved in yet another apparent effort to obtain Hillary Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails from Russian hackers in 2016 , undertaken by Peter Smith , a Republican consultant unconnected to the Trump campaign . ( Flynn has since become a cooperating witness for Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation . )\nMeanwhile , many politicos think Cambridge is full of hot air\nLast but not least , another angle to all this is that as unsettling as Cambridge \u2019 s own claims about its futuristic capabilities may sound \u2014 \u201c I made Steve Bannon \u2019 s psychological warfare tool , \u201d the Observer \u2019 s headline thundered , quoting Christopher Wylie \u2014 many Republican political professionals who \u2019 ve worked with the firm have generally derided the quality of its work .\nBIGGEST SECRET ABOUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA : It was ( & is ) an overpriced service that delivered little value to the TRUMP campaign , & the other campaigns & PACs that retained it \u2014 most of which hired the firm because it was seen as a prerequisite for receiving $ $ $ from the MERCERS . \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel ( @ kenvogel ) March 19 , 2018\nI 've talked to many campaign operatives who think Cambridge is a joke . Take it with a grain of salt . Tech/politics is full of people trashing each other to help their own business . But that 's all I 've ever heard . https : //t.co/bGEXpiOkpF \u2014 Jon Ward ( @ jonward11 ) March 19 , 2018\nI do n't pretend to know anything about tech . What I do know is that * without exception * every campaign I 've spoken to that used CA has complained to me * in real time * ( before these allegations ) that they 're useless . https : //t.co/080FNqrDGZ \u2014 Jonathan Swan ( @ jonathanvswan ) March 20 , 2018\nAs Jonathan Swan says , this isn \u2019 t just revisionist history . Complaints about Cambridge were legion during the 2016 campaign and spilled into the press in real time . Even those years-old articles about the SCL Group I mentioned above hint heavily that the firm may be vastly overselling its talents .\nBut whether Cambridge really discovered some powerful new digital techniques , or whether it was made up of relatively ordinary political consultants with a penchant for hyperbolic rhetoric , things didn \u2019 t end well for either Cambridge or SCL \u2014 both are shutting down , the Journal reports .",

But the gig went poorly \u2014 the Cruz team claimed Cambridge\u2019s data was worthless and fought with them over money, according to a later New York Times report.\n\nCambridge beefed up Donald Trump\u2019s digital operation for the 2016 general election\n\nEventually, Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee-in-waiting. And though Bannon was still a few months away from officially joining the Trump campaign, he made the introduction between Cambridge and Trump\u2019s team. (Bannon owned a stake in Cambridge and was being paid by it at the time.) Various reports name Trump staffers Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Brad Parscale as involved in the decision to bring Cambridge on board, and on June 23, 2016, the campaign signed a contract with the firm.\n\nTrump\u2019s digital team was run by Parscale out of an office in San Antonio, Texas, and Cambridge sent along 13 people to work with them there, Wired reported.\n\nWhat did they do? Well, in the new Channel 4 News report, Nix, the Cambridge CEO, brags to someone he thought was a prospective client that \u201cwe did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy\u201d (though he could be inflating the company\u2019s role).\n\nHowever, one thing that both Trump aides and Cambridge staffers have since claimed the company did not do for Trump is use the firm\u2019s fancy, futuristic-sounding \u201cpsychographic\u201d personality modeling. People from both camps have said, in public statements and to reporters, that the Trump campaign chose to use the RNC\u2019s data file as its raw data, not those tens of millions of personal profiles matched with Facebook data that Cambridge obtained.\n\nIf this is true, Cambridge\u2019s work for Trump resembled less sexy, more traditional political consulting. More specifically:\n\nCambridge oversaw a $5 million placement of TV ads \u2014 though the Times reports that the Trump campaign was unhappy with the results, since Cambridge ended up paying for ads on cable channels in Washington, DC.\n\nThe firm worked on targeting digital ads and online fundraising.\n\nThey did polling of swing states.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that, at the same time, other Cambridge employees were working for the Mercer-backed Super PAC \u201cMake America Number 1\u201d that was supporting Trump. This work, they say, was firewalled off from Trump\u2019s campaign (as it legally has to to be).\n\nIn the end, Federal Election Commission filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge $5.9 million over the rest of the campaign, and the Wall Street Journal reported that $3 million more went to Cambridge through Parscale\u2019s firm.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump\u2019s digital operation was generally thought to be a joke, and Clinton\u2019s team was portrayed as the ingenious data wizards with incredible algorithms. But after Clinton\u2019s shocking loss, people naturally searched for explanations \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica was willing and eager to take credit. Not everyone bought it, though \u2014 the Spectator\u2019s Paul Wood asked \u201cAre Cambridge Analytica brilliant scientists or snake-oil salesmen?\u201d in December 2016.\n\nCambridge got its Facebook data through questionable means\n\nOf late, though, Cambridge has faced a new round of scrutiny over just how it got all that Facebook data in the first place \u2014 and Facebook, too, is facing major questions about what happened.\n\nThe Guardian actually broke much of this story all the way back in December 2015, when Cambridge was still backing Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign. But in March 2018, a former Cambridge employee, Christopher Wylie, provided documents and first-person testimony in both a Times story (by Matthew Rosenberg, Nick Confessore, and Carole Cadwalladr) and an Observer story (by Cadwalladr) laying out, in far more detail, exactly what happened.\n\nAleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic at Cambridge University, got permission from Facebook to pull data via an app he created \u2014 but he reportedly claimed he\u2019d use this data only for academic purposes, not commercial ones.\n\nKogan\u2019s app, \u201cthisismydigitallife,\u201d was a personality quiz Facebook users could take. However, to take the quiz, users had to consent to give the app access to their and their friends\u2019 Facebook profiles.\n\nMore than 270,000 people used the app and took the quiz. However, because they consented to give the app access to their friends\u2019 profiles, too, Kogan ended up collecting data from far more. Initially, the estimate was 50 million raw profiles, of which about 30 million could be matched with other records that helped identify people. Now, Facebook says 87 million users\u2019 profiles \u201cmay have been improperly shared\u201d with Cambridge.\n\nCambridge Analytica was the brains behind Kogan\u2019s operation and ended up spending about $7 million on this data, Wylie told the Observer. (It also seems that Bannon gave the new company its name because of all this, since Kogan worked at Cambridge University.)\n\nFacebook says it learned that Kogan had violated its rules by passing on the information to third parties in 2015 and that it subsequently got assurances from Kogan and Cambridge that they deleted the data they\u2019d collected. However, a former Cambridge employee told the Times that \u201che had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes\u201d of that data still on the company\u2019s servers.\n\nBoth Facebook and Cambridge have faced enormous criticism for all this, and as the news was about to break, Facebook announced it would suspend Cambridge, SCL Group, Kogan, and Wylie from its platform.\n\nHowever, despite Wylie\u2019s dramatic claims that he and Cambridge \u201cbroke Facebook,\u201d the harvesting of such data, even from users\u2019 friends who didn\u2019t clearly consent, does seem to have been clearly allowed by Facebook at the time, and many app developers had similar practices. Indeed, Zeynep Tufekci argues that this is an \u201call-too-natural consequence of Facebook\u2019s business model,\u201d since the company makes money \u201cby profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any laws were broken here \u2014 Andrew Keane Woods runs down some possibilities at Lawfare \u2014 but regulators in the US and the UK both say they\u2019re looking into the matter.\n\nImportantly, it hasn\u2019t been shown Cambridge used this Facebook profile info in its work for the Trump campaign. (Wylie left the firm in late 2014, so he can\u2019t speak to that.)\n\nAlso, apropos of nothing, Aleksandr Kogan at one point changed his name to \u201cDr. Spectre,\u201d but then changed it back.\n\nCambridge\u2019s CEO bragged about doing shady stuff to someone he thought was a potential client\n\nShortly after Wylie came forward publicly, Channel 4 News in the UK began to publish a series that was the result of a four-month investigation it conducted into Cambridge Analytica.\n\nChannel 4 got a reporter to pose as a wealthy Sri Lankan interested in influencing politics in his home country \u2014 and secretly taped Cambridge executives, including eventually CEO Alexander Nix, as they pitched their services to him in a series of meetings.\n\nIt was Nix, hoping to close the deal, who said the most attention-getting things. He said the company operates \u201cin the shadows\u201d and that he looks forward \u201cto building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.\u201d He said that his company could have an operative try to videotape a politician they want to discredit accepting a bribe. \u201cThey will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.\u201d\n\nAnother possibility, Nix continued, was to \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cWe could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us,\u201d since they\u2019re \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d However, he did go on to say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t pay too much attention to what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\u201d Nix also told the supposed prospective client that he uses an email service called ProtonMail and sets it to delete all his mail two hours after it\u2019s read, so there will be no \u201cpaper trail.\u201d\n\nAs the Atlantic\u2019s David Graham notes, dirty tricks like these don\u2019t really have anything to do with big data or psychographic personality profiling. They make Cambridge sound rather more like an ordinary political consulting firm from the shadier side of the business. In any case, Nix\u2019s comments to Channel 4 have created enough of an uproar that Cambridge said it\u2019s suspending him pending an investigation. (What that means for Nix\u2019s position at SCL Group is not yet clear.)\n\nCambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO also reached out to Julian Assange in search of hacked Democratic emails\n\nYet the new reports aren\u2019t the only reason Cambridge is under scrutiny. One of the central focuses of special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation is whether anyone on Trump\u2019s team had inside knowledge about or played any role in the hacking and leaking of prominent Democrats\u2019 emails in 2016.\n\nAnd we learned last year, via reporting from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus, that Nix \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s CEO \u2014 had contacted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about just that topic, both just before and after Cambridge signed on with the Trump campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence yet that Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange actually led to anything. But here\u2019s the timeline of what we know happened:\n\nIn mid-May 2016, Cambridge began discussions with Trump\u2019s team about work for the campaign.\n\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange publicly claimed to have \u201cupcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d which he specified were \u201cemails.\u201d\n\nNix says that it was after he saw this report, in \u201cearly June,\u201d that he reached out to Assange to ask if he could get an advance look at those emails. He says that Assange turned him down.\n\nAt some point that same month, Cambridge board member Rebekah Mercer talked with an associate about whether they should try to somehow obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, a source told Ballhaus. (Clinton deleted about 33,000 emails, about half of the total on her server, rather than turn them over to the government because she said they were personal rather than work-related.) Ballhaus\u2019s source claimed Mercer decided not to go through with this.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Cambridge sent a proposed contract to Trump\u2019s team.\n\nOn June 23, 2016, the Trump campaign signed a contract with Cambridge to do digital work.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began posting hacked DNC emails.\n\nIn August 2016, Nix emailed Mercer and other Cambridge employees and said that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, and offered to help better organize the WikiLeaks-posted DNC emails, but hadn\u2019t yet heard back.\n\nBoth Nix and Assange have said, however, that these overtures never went anywhere. No evidence has emerged to disprove them. Still, this is yet another addition to the list of Trump associates who betrayed at least some interest in getting involved with hacked Democratic emails (and we should keep in mind that the email hackings themselves were a crime).\n\nThere have been also questions about whether Trump\u2019s data operation worked with Russia\n\nFinally, separately from Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange, there have been questions for months about whether the Trump campaign\u2019s data operation collaborated with Russian digital efforts to boost Trump or hurt Clinton in some way.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in December that Mueller had requested Cambridge turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign. And anonymously sourced reports from McClatchy and Vanity Fair, among others, have said Mueller\u2019s team is looking into whether Trump\u2019s digital operation provided information to Russians to help them determine which American voters to target with their own digital efforts.\n\nAs of now, there is no evidence that this occurred, and Mueller\u2019s recent indictment of several Russian individuals and companies for conspiring to interfere with the election through their propaganda work makes no allegations that anyone on Trump\u2019s team was aware of their activities.\n\nBut since Cambridge was a major part of Trump\u2019s digital operation, there are some questions about them and their own ties to Russia.\n\nThe firm has also claimed to have done work in Russia and Ukraine in the past.\n\nAleksandr Kogan, who provided that Facebook data, is also an associate professor at St. Petersburg University and got a grant from the Russian government to research social networks.\n\nCambridge at one point tried to land business from the Russian oil and gas company Lukoil.\n\nDays after WikiLeaks began posting the DNC emails and at the height of the 2016 campaign, Nix was photographed on a polo field with the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, according to Mother Jones.\n\nAnother odd note is that toward the end of the campaign, Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn signed on to do consulting for the SCL Group. It is not clear what, if anything, Flynn did for them. However, and perhaps unrelatedly, some reports have suggested that Flynn was involved in yet another apparent effort to obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails from Russian hackers in 2016, undertaken by Peter Smith, a Republican consultant unconnected to the Trump campaign. (Flynn has since become a cooperating witness for Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.)\n\nMeanwhile, many politicos think Cambridge is full of hot air\n\nLast but not least, another angle to all this is that as unsettling as Cambridge\u2019s own claims about its futuristic capabilities may sound \u2014 \u201cI made Steve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare tool,\u201d the Observer\u2019s headline thundered, quoting Christopher Wylie \u2014 many Republican political professionals who\u2019ve worked with the firm have generally derided the quality of its work.\n\nTake these tweets from three well-connected political reporters:\n\nBIGGEST SECRET ABOUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: It was (& is) an overpriced service that delivered little value to the TRUMP campaign, & the other campaigns & PACs that retained it \u2014 most of which hired the firm because it was seen as a prerequisite for receiving $$$ from the MERCERS. \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) March 19, 2018\n\nI've talked to many campaign operatives who think Cambridge is a joke. Take it with a grain of salt. Tech/politics is full of people trashing each other to help their own business. But that's all I've ever heard. https://t.co/bGEXpiOkpF \u2014 Jon Ward (@jonward11) March 19, 2018\n\nI don't pretend to know anything about tech. What I do know is that *without exception* every campaign I've spoken to that used CA has complained to me *in real time* (before these allegations) that they're useless. https://t.co/080FNqrDGZ \u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) March 20, 2018\n\nAs Jonathan Swan says, this isn\u2019t just revisionist history. Complaints about Cambridge were legion during the 2016 campaign and spilled into the press in real time. Even those years-old articles about the SCL Group I mentioned above hint heavily that the firm may be vastly overselling its talents.\n\nBut whether Cambridge really discovered some powerful new digital techniques, or whether it was made up of relatively ordinary political consultants with a penchant for hyperbolic rhetoric, things didn\u2019t end well for either Cambridge or SCL \u2014 both are shutting down, the Journal reports.",
