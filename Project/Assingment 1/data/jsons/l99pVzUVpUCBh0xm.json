In recent years , PG & E has invested heavily in renewables , but from 1989 to 1991 , the utility was part of the campaign to delay and derail climate action through the Global Climate Coalition , a group of industry groups that worked to delay and derail regulation through 2002 .\n\u201c Everyone that was part of misinforming the public , misleading the public , and false advertising should be held accountable , \u201d she says . \u201c There is , in my vision of the future , a very important role for utilities to play in being held accountable . \u201d\nThis was the first time Harris has weighed in on the utility \u2019 s role after power shut-offs in her home state .
