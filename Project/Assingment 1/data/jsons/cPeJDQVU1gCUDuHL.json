    "content": "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson on Sunday defended Americans \u2019 rights to own guns following the Colorado massacre and calls for tougher weapons laws , saying the real issues are \u201c sick , demented individuals \u201d and how the country deals with them .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t an issue about guns , \u201d Johnson , R-Wis. , said on `` Fox News Sunday . '' \u201c This is really an issue about sick , demented individuals . It 's a tragedy , and I do n't think there \u2019 s a solution in Washington to solve that problem . ... other than look to our families , look to our communities , starting with our education system . We 've got to re-instill values in what we 're teaching our children . We need to look at families and the education system . \u201d\nHe also pointedly called the alleged Colorado shooter , James Holmes , `` a sick , demented , evil individual . ''\nJohnson faced off on the gun-control issue with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , following the mass shooting early Friday in Colorado in which a gunman allegedly used an AR-15 rifle with a large magazine to kill 12 people and injure dozens of others in a movie theater .\nFeinstein , D-Calif. , argued the federal government should put a ban on rapid-fire weapons and large magazines , which can hold as many as 100 rounds .\n\u201c Weapons of war don \u2019 t belong on the streets , \u201d Feinstein said on the show . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to sit down and really come to grips on what is sold to average citizens . \u201d\nFeinstein -- whose legislation banning assault weapons for 10 years expired in 2004 -- said she has no problem with somebody owning a registered gun and that gun-rights groups have become so powerful that lawmakers are reluctant to push and vote for more gun control for fear of political backlash .\nStill , Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper , also a Democrat , suggested tighter regulations likely would not have prevented Holmes .\n`` If it was n't one weapon , it would have been another . I mean , he was diabolical , '' he said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` If there were no assault weapons available , and no this or no that , this guy is going to find something , right ? He 's going to know how to create a bomb . ''\nThe call for federal lawmakers to tighten gun laws began shortly after the shooting , including one from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , an independent .\n`` Soothing words are nice , '' he said in a radio interview , `` but maybe it 's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it , because this is obviously a problem across the country . ''\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg over the weekend urged Congress to swiftly address a ban on certain weapons .\n\u201c Let 's stop wasting time and start saving lives , \u201d Lautenberg , D-N.J. said on his Twitter account . \u201c Congress must prioritize a ban on high-capacity gun magazines . \u201d\nA Lautenberg told the Huffington Post : \u201c If reports are correct and a high-capacity gun magazine was used to commit these awful murders , Senator Lautenberg will absolutely renew his effort to limit the availability of this dangerous firearm attachment . ''\nLast year , Lautenberg introduced legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines . He also has authored other gun-related bills including one that would close so-called loopholes on background checks for buyers at gun shows .\nOnce , every highly publicized outbreak of gun violence produced strong calls from Democrats and a few Republicans for tougher controls on firearms .\nNow those pleas are muted , a political paradox that 's grown more pronounced in an era scarred by Columbine , Virginia Tech , the wounding of a congresswoman and now the shooting in a suburban movie theater where carnage is expected on-screen only .\n`` We do n't want sympathy . We want action , '' Dan Gross , president of the Brady campaign said Friday as Obama and Romney mourned the dead .\nEd Rendell , the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania , was more emphatic than many in the early hours after the shooting . `` Everyone is scared of the NRA , '' he said on MSNBC . `` Number one , there are some things worth losing for in politics and to be able to prevent carnage like this is worth losing for . ''\nYet it 's been more than a decade since gun control advocates had a realistic hope of getting the type of legislation they seek , despite predictions that each shocking outburst of violence would lead to action .\nIn 1994 , when Congress approved the 10-year ban on 19 types of military-style assault weapons . Some Democrats quickly came to believe the legislation contributed to their loss of the House a few months later .\nFive years later , Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking Senate vote on legislation to restrict sales at gun shows .\nThe two events turned out to be the high-water mark of recent Democratic drives to enact federal legislation aimed at reducing gun violence , and some Republicans said they could see the shift coming .\nBy 2004 , when the assault weapon ban lapsed , congressional Democrats made no serious attempt to pass an extension . President George W. Bush was content to let it fade into history .\nAccording to a Gallup poll in 1990 , 78 percent of those surveyed said laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter , while 19 percent said they should remain the same or be loosened .\nBy the fall of 2004 support for tougher laws had dropped to 54 percent . In last year 's sounding , 43 percent said they should be stricter , and 55 percent said they should stay the same or be made more lenient .\nThe issue often divides rural voters from urban voters , which can also mean Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other .\nIn the current election cycle , the National Rifle Association has made 88 percent of its political donations to Republicans , and 12 percent to Democrats , according to OpenSecrets.org . The disparity obscures that the organization consistently supports some Democrats , a strategy that allows it to retain influence in both parties .\nIt also reported spending $ 2.9 million on lobbying last year .\nIts clout was vividly on display in 2010 when majority Democrats in the House sidetracked legislation giving the District of Columbia a voting representative in the House . Republicans had vowed to add an NRA-backed provision invalidating a city ban on handgun possession as the price for passage , and there was little doubt it had the votes to prevail .\nObama won the White House despite strong opposition from the NRA .\nAs a senator from Illinois and state lawmaker before that , he was a strong supporter of gun control .\nFollowing last year 's killing of six people and the wounding of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson , Ariz. , Obama called for steps to `` keep those irresponsible , law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place .
