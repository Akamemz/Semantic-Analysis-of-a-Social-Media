    "content": "Soon after video recorded by Feidin Santana showing officer Michael Thomas Slager killing Walter Scott went public , Ed Driggers , the chief of the North Charleston , South Carolina , police force where Slager was once employed , spoke to the press . Like an increasing number of law enforcement officials as of late , Driggers found himself suddenly thrust into the media spotlight , tasked with explaining to an outraged nation why one of his officers used deadly force against an unarmed African-American , a 50-year-old father of four , who posed no threat .\nBut although Driggers \u2019 public appearance was , on a superficial level , all too reminiscent of what we recently saw in places as disparate as Ferguson , Missouri ; Cleveland , Ohio ; Staten Island , New York ; and Los Angeles , California , the substance was different . Because rather than mount a defense of officer Slager \u2014 who repeatedly claimed that he shot Scott only after a routine stop over a busted taillight led to physical altercation , one during which he feared for his life \u2014 Driggers buried him instead . \u201c I have watched the video and I was sickened by what I saw , \u201d he said . \u201c And I have not watched it since . \u201d\nWhat a difference a smartphone can make . As Judd Legum of Think Progress has noted , if not for the remarkably brave Santana , who used his smartphone to record the final moments of Scott \u2019 s life , the only version of the story the world would know is the version Slager told . Which , in plain language , was a monstrous lie . There 's no evidence that Scott tried to use Slager \u2019 s taser against him , as the officer claimed ; the only reason it was found near the dead man \u2019 s body , it appears , is because that \u2019 s where Slager put it . And contrary to what Slager said in the official incident report , he never feared for his personal safety ; as he pumps Scott \u2019 s back full of bullets he is calm , cool and collected .\nAccording to the work of one local reporter , Slager \u2019 s neighbors didn \u2019 t suspect him of being especially malevolent or inclined toward violence . To them , he seemed normal \u2014 even nice . Driggers responded with a similar mix of sadness and bewilderment . \u201c I want to believe in my heart of hearts that it was a tragic set of events after a traffic stop , \u201d Driggers said on CNN . \u201c I always look for the good in folks , \u201d he continued , \u201c and so I would hope that nobody would ever do something like that. \u201d Keith Summey , the town \u2019 s mayor , was also fatalistic : \u201c When you \u2019 re wrong , you \u2019 re wrong , \u201d he told the press . \u201c And if you make a bad decision \u2026 you have to live by that decision . \u201d\nNeither man was interested in damning Slager ; and considering he is now facing charges for murder , that \u2019 s probably for the best .

The mayor and he noted that the NCPD is composed of more than 340 officers . The video traveling all over the world was hideous , no doubt .
