'' The president added that he `` will be , perhaps speaking about this next week '' and predicted that `` you \u2019 re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next 2 weeks . ''\nWhen asked by Carlson why he tweeted about the alleged phone tap before producing evidence , Trump said his definition of wiretapping `` covers a lot of different things . ''\n`` That really covers surveillance and many other things , '' he said . `` Nobody ever talks about the fact that [ the words 'wires tapped ' ] was in quotes [ in the tweet ] , but that \u2019 s a very important thing . ''\nTrump also addressed the swirling debate around the repeal-and-replace health care legislation that 's split Republican lawmakers . Trump called himself an `` arbitrator '' and said changes and negotiations to the bill would be forthcoming -- despite rhetoric to the contrary from House Speaker Paul Ryan .\n`` We will take care of our people or I 'm not signing it , OK ? '' Trump said . `` Just so you understand . This is very preliminary . ''\nTrump defended his ongoing use of social media while in office , saying that `` maybe I would n't be here if it was n't for Twitter , because I get such a fake press , such a dishonest press .\n`` I 'm not including Fox , '' the president added , `` because I think Fox has been fair to me ... [ but ] the news is not honest , much of the news . It 's not honest , and when I have close to 100 million people watching me on [ social media ] , I have my own form of media . ''\nWhen Carlson countered that Trump `` devalues his own currency '' if allegations he makes on Twitter turn out to be untrue , the president responded , `` Well , let 's see whether or not I prove it . ''\n`` If I do n't do that , I wo n't get my word out , because when I say things , the press does n't cover it accurately , '' Trump later said . `` If they 're not going to do me the honor or the public the honor of spreading my word accurately ... when I can reach that many people , Twitter is a wonderful thing for me , because I get the word out . ''\nWhen Carlson asked whether any of the president 's tweets were moderated by his staff , Trump responded , `` Sure ... A lot of times , my staff comes to me and they say , 'Can you do a tweet on this or that because it 's not being shown correctly . ' ''\nTrump also responded sharply to the leak of two pages of his 2005 tax returns , calling the MSNBC report `` a disgrace . ''\n`` I have no idea where they got it but it \u2019 s illegal and they \u2019 re not supposed to have it and it 's not supposed to be leaked , and it \u2019 s certainly not an embarrassing tax return at all , but it \u2019 s an illegal thing they \u2019 ve been doing it , they \u2019 ve done it before and I think it \u2019 s a disgrace , '' he said .\nThe commander-in-chief 's comments came after DCReport.org reporter David Cay Johnston revealed 2005 Trump tax documents to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow .",
