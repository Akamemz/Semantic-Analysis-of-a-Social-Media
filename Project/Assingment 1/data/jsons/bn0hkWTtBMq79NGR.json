Snails that live in tropical fresh water in these locations are intermediaries between disease-causing parasitic worms and humans . People in developing countries who do n't have access to clean water and good sanitation facilities are often exposed to the infected snails . Then they 're left open to the parasitic worms . The worms ' infectious larvae emerge from the snails , cruise in shallow water , easily penetrate human skin and mature in internal organs . The result is schistosomiasis , the second most socioeconomically devastating disease after malaria . As of 2009 , 74 developing nations had identified significant rates of schistosomiasis in human populations .\nMoore is not some fringe right-winger . He is the senior economics writer and an editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal . And , while on a nationally televised show , he called for killing a government-funded scientific study while bragging about not understanding the research behind it .\nIf this sounds familiar , it 's because Rush Limbaugh said virtually the same thing on his radio show earlier that day , suggesting that science today is an extension of the Democratic Party :\nFor conservative media like Moore and Limbaugh , scientific ignorance is a feature , not a glitch . From climate science and polar bears to economics to condoms to social sciences to duck penises , conservative media peddle the same anti-science behavior over and over and over . The logic goes that scientists are inherently biased because they care about science . It 's third-rate sophism combined with fourth-rate Luddism .\nThis is not to say that all scientists are correct just by virtue of them being scientists .
