Four years ago , when he was in the home stretch of his first term and running for a second , he said much the same thing .\nOne of the `` few regrets '' of his presidency , President Obama said dolefully in his State of the Union speech , was `` that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better .

But he pledged to `` keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office . ''\nAt the State of Union address , President Obama said he regretted that the division between the parties had worsened .\n`` I 'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington , that I wanted to see instituted , where we were n't constantly in a political slugfest . . . I have n't fully accomplished that , '' Obama told an interviewer in 2012 . `` My biggest disappointment is that we have n't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked . ''\nFrom his earliest days as a presidential contender , Obama had held himself out as a healer \u2014 as a visionary who would never `` pit red America against blue America , '' who committed himself to ending `` a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism . '' That uplifting promise was at the very heart of Obama 's appeal ; it was what led so many voters to invest so much hope and faith \u2014 even love \u2014 in the prospect of an Obama presidency .\nYet in his first term , American political life grew more bitter , not less . Unity and goodwill receded even further . As measured by Gallup , Obama supplanted George W. Bush as the most polarizing president ever . Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the nastiness and distrust . The president often took the low road ; his opponents often did too . Deeply controversial legislation , especially Obamacare , was rammed through on party-line votes .

A second term offered this most polarizing of presidents a chance to extend olive branches \u2014 and to eschew the ad hominem attacks that so infuriate his critics .
