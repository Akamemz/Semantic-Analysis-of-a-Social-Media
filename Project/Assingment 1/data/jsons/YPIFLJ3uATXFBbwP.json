Only Rhode Island topped Colorado in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often , according to the study .\nThe study averaged state-specific data over two-year periods . It found that , for the 2011-2012 period , 10.4 % of Colorado residents 12 and older said they had used pot in the month before being surveyed . That number jumped to 12.7 % in the 2012-2013 data . That means about 530,000 people in Colorado use marijuana at least once a month , according to the results .\nNationally , about 7.4 % of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use . That 's an increase of about 4 % .\nIn Washington state , which also legalized marijuana use and limited possession for adults , monthly pot use rose about 20 % to 12.3 % of people 12 and older .\nThe survey is among the first to quantify pot use in Colorado since late 2012 , when voters approved legal pot use and possession for those over 21 .
