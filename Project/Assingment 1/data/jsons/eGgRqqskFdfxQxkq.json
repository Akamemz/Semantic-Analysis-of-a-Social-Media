She \u2019 s speaking in Fort Dodge , Iowa , as voters line up to see Pete Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like a train wreck .

Democrats \u2019 fervent desire to defeat Mr. Trump , and the lack of an \u201c establishment favorite , \u201d led to a historically large field \u2013 at one point topping 20 candidates , now at 12 . And with Mr. Trump looming over the race , many Democrats have emphasized that , above all else , they are looking for a candidate who can beat him . For some voters , a kind of mental gridlock has set in as they consider the array of choices .\n\u201c For Democrats , there \u2019 s really a sense of existential crisis that Donald Trump must be beaten at all costs , \u201d says David Redlawsk , a political scientist at the University of Delaware who has attended some 125 candidate events in Iowa while on a six-month sabbatical . \u201c But there \u2019 s little agreement on what it will take to beat Trump . \u201d\nIn his latest academic survey of likely Iowa caucusgoers , taken in late December and early January , Mr. Redlawsk found that only 16 % were considering just one candidate . Many voters , he says , are torn between \u201c head and heart \u201d \u2013 who they \u2019 d like to see go up against Mr. Trump versus who they think can actually beat him .\nThe Democratic candidate who has perhaps suffered the most from the Trump-induced media eclipse is moderate Sen.
