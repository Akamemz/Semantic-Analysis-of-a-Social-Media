The most vocal critic was American Cardinal Raymond Burke , who described the Church under Francis as like \u201c a ship without a rudder. \u201d But as conservative bishops and lower-level clergy in the U.S. began to signal their agreement , Burke quickly found himself demoted from his powerful Vatican post to a purely ceremonial role .\nThe move sent a chill through the ranks of American conservative bishops , nearly two dozen of whom declined comment when contacted by FoxNews.com , despite many having previously expressed strong doubts about the church 's leftward swerve under Francis , who assumed the papacy in 2013 .\nBut conservatives at the grassroots level remain alienated by Francis ' liberal turn , and are not likely to be cowed , John Allen , associate editor of Crux and the Boston Globe and author of a forthcoming book on Pope Francis , told FoxNews.com .\n\u201c There is growing ambivalence to Pope Francis in conservative Catholic circles , especially in the States , \u201d Allen said , noting a number of reasons that make some U.S. Catholics more likely to oppose Francis .\n\u201c One [ reason ] is that being pro-life is the litmus test for Catholic orthodoxy that is stronger than any other place in the world , because debates over gay marriage and abortion are live here , while they have been settled elsewhere , \u201d Allen said . \u201c The perception is that the Pope is soft on these issues -- true or not , the perception is out there . \u201d\nOutside the Church , Francis is riding a wave of popularity .
