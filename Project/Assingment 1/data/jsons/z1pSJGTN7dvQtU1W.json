About 100,000 new jobs are needed each month simply to keep pace with population growth.\n\nThe jobless rate would be much higher today \u2014 more like the 11 percent Romney notes \u2014 if labor force participation were as high as when Obama took office.

Since the recovery kicked in, the private sector has added jobs for 31 straight months, bringing the total to 5.2 million new jobs.\n\nSo What's The Outlook?\n\nThe past three-and-a-half years could be considered a split decision, with good points and bad. But what lies ahead?\n\nRomney says his economic policies would create about 12 million jobs over the next four years. But many independent economists say that's the same number of jobs that would be created under current policies.\n\nJoseph Davis, chief economist for the mutual fund giant Vanguard, said he doesn't see the unemployment rate improving significantly until Congress takes definitive action to reduce the deficit and the debt.

For example, Jack Welch, the retired CEO of General Electric, tweeted that the drop in the jobless rate was \"unbelievable,\" and added this reference to Obama: \"can't debate, so change numbers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics has a reputation for honest work.
