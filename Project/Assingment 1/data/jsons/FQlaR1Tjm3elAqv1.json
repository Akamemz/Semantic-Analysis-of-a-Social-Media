Meanwhile , Trump faces a host of new questions about his prospects against Clinton in the fall , including whether his unorthodox approach to winning the GOP primary will translate into a general election battle against one of the biggest names in politics .\n`` It is a big challenge but he has already defied every single thing of political gravity that we have known , '' said Mike Shields , former Chief of Staff for the Republican National Committee .\n`` Who 's to say that he ca n't do all of these things and then some , '' Shields said on CNN 's `` New Day . ''\nJUST WATCHED Trump vs. Clinton : mapping out a potential path to 270 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump vs. Clinton : mapping out a potential path to 270 02:59\nA new CNN/ORC poll on Wednesday found that Clinton leads Trump 54 % to 41 % in a potential general election match-up -- her biggest lead since July . She is more trusted than him on issues ranging from foreign policy to education and health care .\nStill , by a 50 % to 45 % margin , voters say Trump would do a better job handling the economy than Clinton . And almost 9 out of 10 voters in the poll called the economy extremely or very important to their vote , outranking any other issue tested in the poll .\nThe political skills that Trump brought to the primary fight could prove potent in a race already shaping up as a bitter , nasty personal clash with Clinton .\nAfter all , the tough tactics from the political neophyte disrupted one of the most experienced Republican fields in a generation . He destroyed the political hopes of Jeb Bush with his `` low energy '' jibe . Trump 's brawling tongue also obliterated -- at least for now -- the potential of the GOP 's next generation of political rock stars , `` Lyin '' Ted Cruz and `` Little '' Marco Rubio .\nHe 's trying to take a similar approach to Clinton , dubbing her `` Crooked Hillary . ''\nWith an unerring eye for a rival 's weaknesses , he revolutionized how campaigns are won , becoming a master of social media , hijacking news agendas with skills honed on a reality television and a mastery of targeted marketing .\nAnd with undeniable political skill , Trump -- a multi-billionaire with a Boeing equipped with gold seat belts -- became an earthy cypher for ignored blue collar Americans who revile conventional politicians as they struggle to get by in a wounded economy .\nUsing just a few issues , like illegal immigration , the toll wreaked on industrial communities by free trade and by playing into a wider sense of national decline with his `` Make America Great Again '' message , Trump made himself an unstoppable political force . His bite was so intimidating that by the time competitors such as Bush , Cruz and Rubio mustered the courage to lambast his past , his character and his politics , their campaigns were already faltering .\nClinton may not make a similar mistake . In an interview Wednesday with CNN 's Anderson Cooper , she showed no problem hitting Trump .\n`` He 's a loose cannon , '' she said . `` And loose cannons tend to misfire .

MUST WATCH Hillary Clinton : Donald Trump 'is a loose cannon ' 01:07\nAnd deeper questions also lurk around Trump . They begin with : What will the rest of America think ?\nEven though , in recent primaries , Trump lifted his vote totals easily above the 50 % mark , his core support in the blue collar Republican electorate still represents a minority of opinion in a nation that is becoming more diverse and less white .\nThat 's fueling questions about whether Trump has already inflicted fatal damage on the Republican Party 's hopes of winning back the presidency after eight years . After its defeat to President Barack Obama in 2012 , the GOP determined it needed to do more to reach out to women , minorities and socially moderate voters , or risk being washed up by the tides of demographic change sweeping the country .\nYet Trump enters the general election with rock-bottom approval ratings among Hispanics , African-Americans and women voters -- and appears to need a mythically large turnout from white American males if he is to prevail in November .\nHis rudimentary policy platforms will come under increasing scrutiny , like the apparently unspecified plan he says will destroy ISIS within months .\nIt 's the same story for his fiscally questionable promises to simultaneously cut taxes , raise military spending , take care of veterans , safeguard social safety net programs and eliminate the national debt .\nThen voters will have to decide if they are willing to elect a President whose impact is already reaching far beyond the nation 's borders , triggering palpable concern abroad at the prospect of 70 years of the post-World War II international order being torn up by a foreign policy neophyte brandishing an `` America First '' slogan .\nTrump will be the first major party nominee not to have served in major elected office since Dwight Eisenhower . Though given Eisenhower 's status as a national hero for masterminding the military defeat of Nazi Germany , a more apt comparison to Trump might be the New York businessman Wendell Willkie , a former Democrat who was nominated by the GOP in 1940 .\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump : Three decades , three parties Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump : Three decades , three parties 01:52\nTrump 's critics worry that his political rhetoric on issues from immigration to women 's rights take American politics closer to the dark fringes of demagoguery than it has been for decades .\nThe Democratic barrage -- playing into such fears -- has already begun .\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren went on the attack soon after Trump 's triumph in Indiana on Tuesday , tweeting that Trump built his campaign on `` racism , sexism , and xenophobia '' and that what happens next `` will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man 's narcissism and divisiveness . ''\nBut Trump may not be the only victim of a negative campaign .\nA no-holds-barred race in which both presidential nominees rake over the other 's substantial political baggage could leave the eventual winner irrevocably damaged and facing a disabled presidency from the start .\nMany Democrats believe that Trump 's victory in the GOP primary means they are almost certain to keep the White House . However , as the past year has proven , they would be unwise to underestimate the power of Trump .",

After its defeat to President Barack Obama in 2012, the GOP determined it needed to do more to reach out to women, minorities and socially moderate voters, or risk being washed up by the tides of demographic change sweeping the country.\n\nRock-bottom approval ratings\n\nYet Trump enters the general election with rock-bottom approval ratings among Hispanics, African-Americans and women voters -- and appears to need a mythically large turnout from white American males if he is to prevail in November.\n\nHis rudimentary policy platforms will come under increasing scrutiny, like the apparently unspecified plan he says will destroy ISIS within months.\n\nIt's the same story for his fiscally questionable promises to simultaneously cut taxes, raise military spending, take care of veterans, safeguard social safety net programs and eliminate the national debt.\n\nThen voters will have to decide if they are willing to elect a President whose impact is already reaching far beyond the nation's borders, triggering palpable concern abroad at the prospect of 70 years of the post-World War II international order being torn up by a foreign policy neophyte brandishing an \"America First\" slogan.\n\nTrump will be the first major party nominee not to have served in major elected office since Dwight Eisenhower. Though given Eisenhower's status as a national hero for masterminding the military defeat of Nazi Germany, a more apt comparison to Trump might be the New York businessman Wendell Willkie, a former Democrat who was nominated by the GOP in 1940.\n\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump: Three decades, three parties Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump: Three decades, three parties 01:52\n\nTrump's critics worry that his political rhetoric on issues from immigration to women's rights take American politics closer to the dark fringes of demagoguery than it has been for decades.\n\nThe Democratic barrage -- playing into such fears -- has already begun.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren went on the attack soon after Trump's triumph in Indiana on Tuesday, tweeting that Trump built his campaign on \"racism, sexism, and xenophobia\" and that what happens next \"will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness.\"\n\nBut Trump may not be the only victim of a negative campaign.\n\nA no-holds-barred race in which both presidential nominees rake over the other's substantial political baggage could leave the eventual winner irrevocably damaged and facing a disabled presidency from the start.\n\nMany Democrats believe that Trump's victory in the GOP primary means they are almost certain to keep the White House. However, as the past year has proven, they would be unwise to underestimate the power of Trump.",
