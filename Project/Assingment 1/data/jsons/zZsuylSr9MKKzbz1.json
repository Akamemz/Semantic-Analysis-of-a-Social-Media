    "content": "Last week , President Barack Obama gathered some of his top advisers in the Oval Office to discuss the problem-plagued rollout of his healthcare legislation . He told his team the administration had to own up to the fact that there were no excuses for not having the health care website ready to operate on Day One .\nThe admonition from a frustrated president came amid the embarrassing start to sign-ups for the health care insurance exchanges . The president is expected to address the cascade of computer problems Monday during an event at the White House .\nAdministration officials say more than 476,000 health insurance applications have been filed through federal and state exchanges . The figures mark the most detailed measure yet of the problem-plagued rollout of the insurance market place .\nHowever , the officials continue to refuse to say how many people have actually enrolled in the insurance markets . And without enrollment figures , it 's unclear whether the program is on track to reach the 7 million people projected by the Congressional Budget Office to gain coverage during the six-month sign-up period .\nThe first three weeks of sign-ups have been marred by a cascade of computer problems , which the administration says it is working around the clock to correct . The rough rollout has been a black eye for Obama , who invested significant time and political capital in getting the law passed during his first term .\nThe officials said technology experts from inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the glitches , though they did not say how many workers were being added .\nOfficials did say staffing has been increased at call centers by about 50 percent . As problems persist on the federally run website , the administration is encouraging more people to sign up for insurance over the phone .\nThe officials would not discuss the health insurance rollout by name and were granted anonymity .\nDespite the widespread problems , the White House has yet to fully explain what went wrong with the online system consumers were supposed to use to sign up for coverage .\nAdministration officials initially blamed a high volume of interest from ordinary Americans for the frozen screens that many people encountered . Since then , they have also acknowledged problems with software and some elements of the system 's design .\nInterest in the insurance markets appears to continue to be high . Officials said about 19 million people have visited HealthCare.gov as of Friday night .\nOf the 476,000 applications that have been started , just over half have been from the 36 states where the federal government is taking the lead in running the markets .
