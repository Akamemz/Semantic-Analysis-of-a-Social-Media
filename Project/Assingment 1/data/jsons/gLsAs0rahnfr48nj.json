As the convention begins , prominent Democrats are still grumbling about that question .\nThey fear the Tar Heel State is no sure win for the president . Recall that in 2008 , Barack Obama won North Carolina by 0.4 percentage points over Arizona Sen. John McCain ( R ) . Before that , the state had gone Republican in every presidential election since 1976 . Current polls have Obama and Romney tied in the state . When then-President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , he famously told an aide that the Democrats would \u201c lose the South for a generation . \u201d\nBut in 2008 , two Southern states , North Carolina and Virginia , swung to the Democrats and helped to elect the first African-American president of the United States .\nThe Democrats want a repeat of that Southern magic this fall . They have reason for optimism in the steady rise of Southern minorities , immigrants , high-tech workers and educated women . That explains why , a year ago , Charlotte seemed like a smart pick .\nAnd even if the Tar Heel State is a loser for Obama , there are Democrats who see value in sending a clear message to the GOP that they have not given up the South . That \u2019 s why Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton \u2014 both former Democratic Southern governors who became president \u2014 will address the convention in prime time .\nBut battling the conservative , Republican , white-male dominance of the South will be tough .
