''\nIn his letter to Energy Department staff , Chu called his stint as energy secretary the `` greatest privilege '' of his life .\nHe cited the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy , a government effort to support energy technology development , as a major accomplishment , along with steps that he said have doubled production of wind and solar energy .\nChu 's letter also defended the loan program linked to Solyndra , noting it was started in the Bush administration and supported 33 projects that he said generated $ 55 billion in economic investment .\n`` While critics try hard to discredit the program , the truth is that only 1 % of the companies we funded went bankrupt , '' Chu wrote , later adding that `` the test for America 's policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes .
