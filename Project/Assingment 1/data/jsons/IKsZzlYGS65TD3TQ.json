    "content": "In following the Israeli election returns , American observers had to feel as if they were experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . It was like the night of the 2016 American elections . The Left media all were reporting exit polls that night that a huge turnout of young Hispanic voters in Florida , determined to defeat Donald Trump , had swung that state to Hillary Clinton . It was all over . Without Florida , Trump had no path to victory . Remember ?\nMeanwhile , Georgia was late to report , and pollsters would not call the state . Would it fall to the Democrats ? The Midwest was a Democrat lock . Hillary could measure the Oval Office curtains .\nBy the end of the night , it sure was curtains for her .\nThroughout Tuesday , the Left media in Israel and in America touted the defeat of Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019 s center-right Likud party , the end of his time leading the only American-style democracy in the Middle East ( unless you consider Syria , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , etc . as American-style democracies ) . His leading opponent , Benny Gantz \u2019 s Blue and White Party , heading a center-left-Arab coalition , would be winning . Indeed , the Left media \u2019 s exit polls were so assuring that Gantz could not even wait for the actual votes to be counted . After learning that he had won the exit polls , Gantz declared victory and promised to be a Prime Minister for all Israelis . \u201c In elections there are winners and losers , and we are the winners , \u201d he said . \u201c We won and we will keep on winning. \u201d Sort of like the Stacey Abrams of Israel : \u201c Thank you for electing me , and yes of course I deserved it . We don \u2019 t have to count the votes now , do we ? \u201d\nAs my earlier pre-election analysis noted , Israel \u2019 s polls are notorious for underestimating the religious-right vote . In that earlier analysis I noted , for example , the hesitation among older immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union to reveal their true political views when interviewed by journalists , remembering how such candor could land them in the Gulag back in the USSR . So they do not talk , or they tell the Left media what they assume the Left journalists want to hear . As a result , early exit polls reported that outgoing Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman \u2019 s party had done so poorly that he had failed to meet the 3.25 % threshold needed for his party to enter the new Knesset ( Parliament ) . However , as the night wore on , it emerged that he had received far more support than his voters had acknowledged when interviewed . Thus , he not only may get in but even may end up with six seats of the 120 Knesset seats .\nPrime Minister Benjamin ( \u201c Bibi \u201d ) Netanyahu \u2019 s Likud numbers also grew as actual ballot numbers replaced the fantasy data of exit polls . Whereas the exit polls had prompted Left media to report that Gantz \u2019 s party had beaten Netanyahu \u2019 s solidly by 37-33 seats , the actual returns started to show that Likud indeed may beat Blue & White by two or three seats , with the remaining parties that comprise the center-right assuring a possible center-right coalition of as many as 68 seats in the 120-seat Knesset .\nThe quirky Zehut party of Moshe Feiglin , which put great stock in promoting marijuana legalization , sustained exactly the problem that I had suggested in my pre-election analysis : pot-heads may tell pollsters they support the dude who promotes weed , but they are not the most reliable constituency on election day . Between tokes and munchies , and just overall amiability and chilling , enough fail to show up to vote that they , like , lose . Bummer .\nThe Haredi \u201c old world \u201d Orthodox parties held their own , while the Modern Orthodox Religious Zionists scored enough to pass the threshold , justifying their strategic wisdom in choosing to have their three different parties merge into one combined slate for the election to assure they would pass the 3.25 % threshold and not see four or five seats lost . Moreover , in a complex agreement they made with Likud several weeks ago , one of the seats that Likud has won will go to the Religious Zionists .\nOn the Left , the socialist Labor party that had dominated Israel for its first thirty years , from 1948-1977 , suffered a stunning collapse , winning perhaps only 6 or 7 seats , compared to the 40-45 seats they regularly won back in the days when leftist Labor socialists like David Ben-Gurion , Moshe Dayan , Golda Meir , Shimon Peres , and Yitzhak Rabin held court . Israel has moved well to the right . The Meretz party , which is even more left-wing , came in with only 4 or 5 seats .\nIt now seems that the center-right will emerge as a coalition of at least 63 seats , and potentially with 67 or 68 seats in the 120-seat Parliament , led by a strengthened Likud under Netanyahu . Liberman , if his six seats hold , may well be Defense Minister again , and Kahlon of the conservative Kulanu party that focuses on advocating for the economic underclass , probably will emerge as Finance Minister again . It seems that the impending conflict between Kahlon and Feiglin over the Finance Ministry thus has been avoided , as Feiglin \u2019 s chances may have gone up in smoke .\nThe remaining important things yet to watch for over the next two days :\n1 . First , Israel counts all votes cast on election day . The whole country votes in person the same day at voting booths unlike the American craziness where so many mail in early ballots weeks before election day , even before the parties have made their cases to the voters . Those tallies should be done by noon on Wednesday in Israel , coinciding with early morning in America , and those votes comprise 95 % of the total cast . That should give a pretty good picture of the pending results , as reflected above .\n2 . Then Israel starts counting the remaining five percent of the vote that has been mailed in from the only four venues permitted to vote by mail : ( i ) soldiers on duty in military outposts , ( ii ) patients in hospitals , ( iii ) prisoners eligible to vote , and ( iv ) overseas diplomats . Historically , the mailed ballots end up swinging the final results one or two seats more to the right . The young soldiers in the service comprise the vast majority of the mail ballots , and they historically are among the most sensitive to Israel \u2019 s security needs because they are on the front lines facing Hamas and Hezbollah on the other side , and they best understand the dangers posed by Left calls for appeasement and Left fantasies of \u201c peace-making \u201d with crazed Islamic terrorist fanatics . It therefore should result in the right-religious coalition emerging at close to 67 or 68 seats .\n3 . The New Right party of Education Minister Naftali Bennett and of Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked is in peril of missing out because , with 95 percent of the voting-booth ballots now counted , they are at 3.17 % of the votes . They need to reach 3.25 % . Insanely close ! Bennett , who headed the Religious Zionists the past two Parliaments , took a huge gamble by breaking from them to form the New Right party that would appeal to secularists , too . His main campaign issues included that he advocates annexing parts of Judea and Samaria ( the \u201c West Bank \u201d ) where there are heavy Jewish populations . Some 400,000 Jews live in Judea and Samaria , primarily in a region known as \u201c Zone C. \u201d Although Israel has annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , both now recognized by America , she had not yet done so with Zone C , despite its clear Jewish majority . As Bennett \u2019 s party gathered steam at the expense of Netanyahu \u2019 s Likud , Bibi pulled an \u201c October surprise \u201d during the last days of the campaign by announcing that he and Likud will move to annex those areas . That shocker is credited with winning back to Likud a great number of their prior backers who were gravitating towards Bennett . In that sense , Bennett \u2019 s gamble paid off even if he misses the 3.25 % threshold : by creating a party that appealed to that segment of Netanyahu \u2019 s base on that issue , he forced Bibi and the Israeli government \u2019 s leading party , Likud , to go on record as preparing to annex the part of Judea and Samaria that is majority Jewish . Again , it is not yet clear whether Bennett \u2019 s own party will retain enough of its earlier support to pass the threshold . So Bennett and Shaked may have to wait until the last envelopes are opened and tabulated , which Israel \u2019 s Central Election Bureau estimates may be as late as Friday .\nHowever it finally shakes out , the Left media \u2019 s glee in Israel and America was premature , Benny Gantz \u2019 s victory speech was Israel \u2019 s Stacey Abrams moment , the Leftist exit polls got it wrong yet again , and now we must wait to see which Leftist Israel anchor will be the Martha Raddatz of Zion who breaks down and cries when the reality of the center-right victory proves irreversible .",
