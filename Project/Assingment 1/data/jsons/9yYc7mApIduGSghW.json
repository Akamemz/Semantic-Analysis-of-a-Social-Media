    "content": "A new CNN/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump 49 % to 44 % in a potential general election matchup . Matchups between Trump and other leading Democratic contenders ( South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ) are even closer .\nCompared to polling taken back in October , the Democratic margin in all the head-to-heads has been cut by at least 5 points .\nPublic opinion on Trump has been remarkably stable throughout his presidency . His approval rating has mostly been stuck in the high 30s to low 40s , and he 's consistently trailed his most likely Democratic opponent ( Biden ) in the polls by high single to low double digits .\nBut as we close out 2019 and head into 2020 , it seems that Trump is gaining ground .\nBeyond our poll , the average live interview poll shows significant movement toward Trump over the last two months . Biden 's lead over the President in a potential matchup has dropped from 12 points to 7 points , which is still the largest advantage of any of the top Democrats against Trump . Trump picked up at least 4 points against the other leading Democrats since October .\nIn the 15 closest states of the 2016 election , where the presidential contest was decided by 8 or fewer points , Trump 's in even better shape . None of the Democrats led in CNN 's December poll . This follows other swing state polling suggesting that , just like in 2016 , Trump could win the electoral college , while losing the popular vote .\nThe shift in Trump 's favor nationally , not surprisingly , coincides with upward movement in his personal popularity . His net favorable rating ( favorable - unfavorable ) stood at -6 points among voters in CNN 's latest poll . His net favorability rating in the two prior CNN polls that asked the question was -12 points .\nThe average poll also demonstrates that Trump is at the high end in his popularity . According to the FiveThirtyEight aggregate , this week Trump hit is highest approval rating among voters ( 45 % ) since March 2017 .\nTrump 's upward trajectory is likely , at least in part , because of the economy . While most people have generally thought the economy is good , a booming 76 % said it was good in the CNN poll out this week . That was the highest percentage since 2001 .\nMeanwhile , the impeachment of Trump does n't seem to be making much of an impact on the polls . That could be because fewer voters say it 's an extremely or very important issue to their vote than any other issue tested by CNN in November . Additionally , it could be because opposition to impeaching and removing Trump is higher than Trump 's popularity ratings . This means more talk of impeachment may actually move Trump 's approval rating up .\nAnother thing helping Trump is that presidential elections are not referendums . He 's going to have a named Democratic opponent . None of the leading Democrats had a positive net favorability rating among voters in CNN 's December poll . In October , all but Warren did . The drop in the Democrats ' popularity could be because they 're involved in a competitive primary , which is hurting their intra-party favorability ratings . None of the Democrats are anywhere near as popular among their own party 's voters as Trump is with his . That could change once the primary ends , though .\nIndeed , it 's not like Trump is in a great position . The two most likely Democratic nominees , Biden and Sanders , are ahead of him by 7 points and 4 points respectively in the average poll .
