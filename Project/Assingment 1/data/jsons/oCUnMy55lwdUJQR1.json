    "content": "There is no shortage of ways to sum up the disappointment that was 2016 for the Democrats .\nJust looking at the presidential election , there are the obvious concerns , such as the loss of Rust Belt states like Michigan , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . And then there are the more nuanced signs of trouble , such as the collapse of support among rural Americans , whom Democrats lost by eight points in 2008 and by 28 this year .\nBut one trend that in some ways predicted those losses has been staring Democrats in the face since before the first vote was cast : In Congress , the face of Democratic leadership has become increasingly dominated by the coasts , with less representation from the vast center that delivered the White House to Donald Trump .\nWhen President Obama assumed office and Democrats controlled both chambers , only 35 percent of Senate committee chairmen came from coastal states . In the House it was 45 percent . In the Congress that \u2019 s just ending , Democrats from the coasts held 70 percent of the top Democratic slots on committees in each chamber .\nSome of that is pure attrition , especially in the Senate . The Republican wave election of 2010 also wiped out many moderate Democrats outside urban and coastal blue bastions . And seniority played a role , with the most experienced Democrats \u2013 who generally get the top posts \u2013 hailing from coastal states .\nBut during 2016 Democrats appeared to double down on the idea that their populous liberal bastions would be enough to win the White House and the Senate . Now , Democrats are coming to the realization that they may have lost their foothold in the heartland and Rust Belt and are struggling with what to do about it .\n\u201c Historically , the Democrats were the party of the have-nots . Now they are becoming the educated haves and the Republicans are the have-nots , \u201d says Gary Nordlinger , a professor at George Washington University 's Graduate School of Political Management .\nThis year \u2019 s poor performance \u2013 only six House seats gained , two Senate seats added , and the White House lost \u2013 caused a revolt among House Democrats after the election . Rep. Tim Ryan ( D ) of Ohio challenged minority leader Nancy Pelosi ( D ) of California for the leadership and was backed by a third of the caucus , some from the swath between the coasts .\nIn response , Representative Pelosi expanded the leadership team and opened some positions to caucus elections and to people with less seniority . A bigger tent is also apparent in the Senate leadership , where , for instance , Democratic Sens . Debbie Stabenow ( Michigan ) , Amy Klobuchar ( Minnesota ) , Joe Manchin ( West Virginia ) were added to the team .\nOverall , in both chambers , the number of top Democratic committee members from coastal states will decline in next year \u2019 s Congress .\nClearly , changing the face of congressional leadership is only a small step toward addressing what some see as the Democratic abandonment of middle America . But it is an important one . Committee leadership provides a political and policymaking megaphone , as well as a farm team for higher office .\n\u201c We as Democrats have to have a stronger economic message that appeals to Midwest and white blue-collar voters , \u201d says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake in an email .\nSome Democrats take issue with the idea that the party has drifted too heavily to the coasts .\n\u201c Certainly in this election , it looks that way . But four years ago , Democrats carried a lot of states in the Midwest with President Obama , \u201d says Brandon Dillon , chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party . In Michigan , Trump beat Hillary Clinton by only a third of a percentage point .\nDemocrats point to the fact that Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote . And they criticize the last-minute revival of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Clinton \u2019 s emails ( which found no wrongdoing ) , as well as the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails by Russia-linked groups , according to the Central Intelligence Agency .\n\u201c The Democratic economic message was not coming through , \u201d Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday .\nStill , many agree that Democrats need to focus on an economic message that appeals more broadly to voters who don \u2019 t feel the economy is working for them . And to deliver that message , Democrats need to show up in middle America , observers say . Clinton \u2019 s last visit to Wisconsin was in April , and Donald Trump \u2019 s visit to the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport on the weekend before the election was scoffed at .\n\u201c Early on in the presidential election , as I looked at the effort to reassemble the Obama coalition [ which focused on supercharging turnout in blue America ] , I remember having a pang , \u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D ) of California , at a recent Monitor breakfast .\nThe calculation was that even if Clinton could not get quite the same showing from all the various groups that supported Obama , those fleeing Mr. Trump would put her over the edge , he said . But there were signs that the Obama coalition has largely worked only for Obama . The party has lost 958 seats in state legislatures around the country since he took office , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis .\nHaving a message that appeals to the Obama coalition and rural , white voters is not \u201c incompatible , \u201d said Representative Schiff , the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee .\n\u201c That great mass in the middle of the country really ought to be most responsive to the message of the Democratic Party , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re going to have to win them back . \u201d\nPutting in the time , listening to constituents , and focusing on the economic message is how Rep.
