These protests began with the killing of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement officers in Minneapolis. Lawmakers have responded with numerous police reforms at the state and federal level, including competing federal proposals from the house and senate.\n\nWhile data and research emerges on the new reform policies, we\u2019re covering a police reform proposal that\u2019s been debated for the last decade: body cameras on police officers. While many police departments across the country have already adopted body cameras, there are still no consistent policies for when they are required, how videos will be released to the public, and how long footage should be stored.\n\nToday, we will walk through the general benefits and drawbacks of requiring body cameras for on-duty police officers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs):\n\nAccording to Urban Institute, Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are small devices that police officers can affix to their person\u2014in a head-, shoulder-, or chest-mounted position\u2014that can audio and video record their interactions with community members. BWCs have received strong support from the public and, in recent years, increased buy-in from police leadership and officers because of their ability to improve accountability and transparency and enhance the collection of evidence.\n\nBWCs, through their associated recordings, have the potential to both expose discretionary decisions made in the field and subject them to review.\n\nWho\u2019s currently using them?\n\nAccording to the Police Executive Research Forum, as of 2018 a nationally representative\n\nsample of police agencies estimated that one-third of American law enforcement agencies currently deploy BWCs to some or all of their officers, and an additional 50 percent of agencies have immediate plans to deploy them.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nPolice actions and decisions in the field have been the focus of substantial research. Yet, recent high\u2010profile incidents of police excessive force have generated greater political and social salience to this matter. Flowing from this have been greater calls for oversight and review of police decisions.
