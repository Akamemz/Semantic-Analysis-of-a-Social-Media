    "content": "When Mr. Bannon spoke on Thursday of \u201c deconstructing the administrative state , \u201d it may have sounded like gobbledygook outside the hall , but it was an electrifying profession of faith for the attendees . It is through Mr. Bannon that Trumpism can be converted from a set of nostalgic laments and complaints into a program for overhauling the government .\nMr. Bannon adds something personal and idiosyncratic to this Tea Party mix . He has a theory of historical cycles that can be considered elegantly simple or dangerously simplistic . It is a model laid out by William Strauss and Neil Howe in two books from the 1990s . Their argument assumes an 80- to 100-year cycle divided into roughly 20-year \u201c highs , \u201d \u201c awakenings , \u201d \u201c unravelings \u201d and \u201c crises. \u201d The American Revolution , the Civil War , the New Deal , World War II \u2014 Mr. Bannon has said for years that we \u2019 re due for another crisis about now . His documentary about the 2008 financial collapse , \u201c Generation Zero , \u201d released in 2010 , uses the Strauss-Howe model to explain what happened , and concludes with Mr. Howe himself saying , \u201c History is seasonal , and winter is coming . \u201d\nMr. Bannon \u2019 s views reflect a transformation of conservatism over the past decade or so . You can trace this transformation in the films he has made . His 2004 documentary , \u201c In the Face of Evil , \u201d is an orthodox tribute to the Republican Party hero Ronald Reagan . But \u201c Generation Zero , \u201d half a decade later , is a strange hybrid . The financial crash has intervened . Mr. Bannon \u2019 s film features predictable interviews with think-tank supply siders and free marketers fretting about big government . But new , less orthodox voices creep in , too , from the protectionist newscaster Lou Dobbs to the investment manager Barry Ritholtz . They question whether the free market is altogether free . Mr. Ritholtz says that the outcome of the financial crisis has been \u201c socialism for the wealthy but capitalism for everybody else . \u201d\nBy 2014 , Mr. Bannon \u2019 s own ideology had become centered on this distrust . He was saying such things about capitalism himself . \u201c Think about it , \u201d he said in a talk hosted by the Institute for Human Dignity . \u201c Not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. \u201d He warned against \u201c the Ayn Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism , \u201d by which he meant \u201c a capitalism that really looks to make people commodities , and to objectify people. \u201d Capitalism , he said , ought to rest on a \u201c Judeo-Christian \u201d foundation .\nIf so , this was bad news for the Republican Party . By the time Mr. Bannon spoke , Ayn Rand-style capitalism was all that remained of its Reagan-era agenda . Free-market thinking had swallowed the party whole , and its Judeo-Christian preoccupations \u2014 \u201c a nation with a culture \u201d and \u201c a reason for being \u201d \u2014 along with it . A business orientation was what donors wanted .\nBut voters never more than tolerated it . It was Pat Buchanan who in his 1992 run for president first called on Republicans to value jobs and communities over profits . An argument consumed the party over whether this was a better-rounded vision of society or just the grousing of a reactionary . After a generation , Mr. Buchanan has won that argument .
