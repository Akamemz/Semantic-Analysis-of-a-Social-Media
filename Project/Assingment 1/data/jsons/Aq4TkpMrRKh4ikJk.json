Voters give politicians second chances\n\nFrom the start of his bid for Congress, Sanford was very open on the campaign trail about the affair and made it the subject of his first TV ad. Sanford asked for, and received, political redemption from the voters.\n\nPhotos: Top 10 political comebacks Photos: Top 10 political comebacks David Vitter \u2013 Sen. David Vitter admitted his guilt in the D.C. Madam scandal in 2007. His phone number had been published in 2009 in a list of phone records from a prostitution ring Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also known as the \"D.C. Madam.\" Three years later he was reelected to the Senate. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Anthony Weiner \u2013 Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, resigned from Congress in 2011 after being embroiled for weeks in a sex scandal linked to his lewd online exchanges with women. Weiner announced in May that he was running for mayor of New York City, saying in a video announcing his campaign, \"I hope I get a second chance to work for you.\" Weiner's comeback bid suffered a potential setback Tuesday, July 23, when he acknowledged more sexually tinged exchanges with an unnamed woman. \"What I did was wrong,\" Weiner said in a statement about the newly emerged communications. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Eliot Spitzer \u2013 Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after it was revealed that he had spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, says he plans to run for New York City's comptroller. \"I accepted responsibly for what I did,\" Spitzer said. \"I spent five years of working, doing useful things, and I hope the public will offer me an opportunity.\" Despite taking knocks from the press, the voters and, in some cases, the law, other politicians have pursued redemption in their public image or, in some cases, a return to office. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Mark Sanford \u2013 Former Gov. Mark Sanford endured heavy criticism and being the butt of jokes until his term ended after he admitted in 2009 that his six-day hiking trip on the Appalachian Trail was actually a cover for a trip to Argentina to visit his mistress. In May, Sanford won election against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch for an open seat in the U.S. House, despite being heavily outspent by Democrats and without the backing of national Republicans. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Bill Clinton \u2013 Bill Clinton had a scandalous presidency, most famously having an affair with an intern that prompted his impeachment. Since, he has become an important figure in worldwide humanitarian efforts and informal adviser to President Obama. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Newt Gingrich \u2013 Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich left his position in disgrace after the Clinton impeachment proceedings in 1998. It was also later revealed that he was having an affair with a Congressional staffer, now his current wife Callista. Gingrich had an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and is now seen as an elder party statesman, regularly appearing in the media on conservative issues. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Gary Hart \u2013 Before becoming an adviser for Homeland Security, retired Sen. Gary Hart was the front-runner of the 1988 Democratic primaries for president until images of him with a model surfaced, ending his campaign. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Dennis Kucinich \u2013 Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, has had many ups and downs in his political career, first becoming mayor of Cleveland, at the age of 31, and then losing a bid for reelection. Kucinich was later elected to the Senate and then the U.S. House but lost when he ran for president in 2004 and again in 2008. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Marion Barry \u2013 Marion Barry is sworn in as the mayor of Washington with his wife, Cora Masters Barry, at his side, in 1995.

Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Top 10 political comebacks Richard Nixon \u2013 Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974 after the Washington Post broke the story on his role in the Watergate burglary. But before being elected president, Nixon was Dwight Eisenhower's vice president. He lost his first presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, and then lost the governor's race in California in 1962. However, in 1968, he got the GOP nomination and defeated Hubert Humphrey in the general election to become president.

Candidates matter\n\nFor all his political baggage, Mark Sanford is a veteran on the campaign trail.

The candidate appeared to be everywhere in the campaign's closing days. He held nearly 15 events on Monday, with another 10 on Election Day.\n\n3. Turnout matters\n\nWe knew Democratic voters were fired up, but the big question concerned Republican voters in a district that the GOP has held for more 30 years. Would they vote even with their reservations about Sanford?\n\nThe answer appears to be yes.\n\nIt was a high turnout for a special election. Roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total, according to a CNN analysis of the vote.\n\n\"That seems to have helped Sanford,\" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. \"Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat.

Location, location, location\n\nMacro: The 1st Congressional District is GOP country. Mitt Romney carried the district by 18 percentage points in last November's presidential election. And Rep. Tim Scott was reelected by 27 points before he was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nEven a candidate with serious political baggage like Sanford was able to win.\n\nMicro: Sanford won all five counties in the district. He won big where he needed to, in the conservative counties of Berkeley and Dorchester, taking around 60% of the vote. He carried the district's second most populous county, Beaufort, by 6 percentage points. Some Democrats hoped that older voters in that county, which includes Hilton Head, would be turned off by Sanford's affair.\n\nSanford narrowly carried his home base of Charleston County, where the most voters were at stake. That was also Colbert Busch's best hope.\n\n5. Money doesn't always matter\n\nColbert Busch's campaign outspent Sanford's operation in the closing weeks. And the DCCC and House Majority PAC combined spent around $900,000 to try to defeat Sanford, who received far less support from outside groups. Money matters in campaign politics, but it's just one factor in determining a race.",
