    "content": "Just before the 2016 election , and then again after its results became clear , I did a series of Atlantic items on a challenge I thought the press was not prepared for .\nThe challenge was dealing with a major political figure\u2014Donald Trump\u2014who fit no previous pattern of how presidents or other major figures conceived of \u201c truth \u201d versus \u201c lies . \u201d\nAll politicians , like all people , will lie about matters large and small . But most politicians , like most people , usually lie for a reason . They want to avoid blame or embarrassment . They want someone to like or treat them better . They want to paint themselves in a better light . They \u2019 ve talked themselves into \u201c believing \u201d a more comfortable version of perhaps-painful truths .\nWe all know examples from daily life . In the life of public figures , it means things like : Richard Nixon lying about Watergate ( in hopes of not getting caught ) . Bill Clinton lying about his affairs ( ditto ) . Lyndon Johnson concealing what he knew about the worsening situation in Vietnam ( so as not to complicate his re-election chances ) . FDR concealing his physical limitations ( so as not to have them complicate his political and policy goals ) .\nSo in dealing with the political universe as of the summer of 2015\u2014the time when Donald Trump entered the presidential race\u2014the press could start by asking : What \u2019 s the reason a certain statement might be a lie ? What would a president \u2014 a mayor , a senator\u2014 have to gain by shading the truth ? The related assumption was that people wouldn \u2019 t go to the trouble of crafting a lie without a reason to do so . Lies are harder to remember than the truth ; they involve more work in getting people to back up your story ; they involve the risk that you \u2019 ll be caught .\nWhat made Donald Trump different was not how much more frequently he lies \u2014 though he does so at a prodigious rate . ( As Daniel Dale and the Washington Post \u2019 s fact-check team , among others , have tirelessly chronicled . )\nRather the difference was that Trump so plainly recognized no distinction between true and false\u2014between what the \u201c facts \u201d showed and what he wanted them to be , between what he wanted people to think and what they could see for themselves . Some public figures are unusually \u201c willing \u201d to lie ; Trump seemed not even to notice he was doing so . The philosopher Harry Frankfurt \u2019 s famous book \u201c On Bullshit \u201d bears on this phenomenon\u2014people who just talk , in a slurry of \u201c true \u201d and \u201c false , \u201d with no concern or even awareness of the difference between the two .\nIn Trump \u2019 s case it became clear long ago that he lacked the mental filter that alerts most people to the boundary between true and false . He would probably sail through any lie-detector test . He does not care if his claim can be instantly disproved ( eg , his \u201c landslide \u201d victory , actually one of the narrowest in history ) . He does not care if his lies contradict one another , as when he attributes the same \u201c someone told me \u201d story to different sources from one day to the next , or rolls out his ludicrous \u201c Sir \u201d anecdotes . He does not care if a lie does him any good\u2014who believes , or cares , whether his uncle was \u201c a great super genius \u201d as a professor at MIT ? He does not care that the Adonis-like heroic portrait that has hung for years at Mar-a-Lago would be a source of mirth for most viewers .\n\u201c The news media are not built for someone like this , \u201d I wrote two months before Trump was sworn in :\n[ We have ] as president-elect a man whose nature as a liar is outside what our institutions are designed to deal with . Donald Trump either can not tell the difference between truth and lies , or he knows the difference but does not care\u2026 . Our journalistic and political assumption is that each side to a debate will \u201c try \u201d to tell the truth\u2014and will count it as a setback if they \u2019 re caught making things up . Until now the idea has been that if you can show a contrast between words and actions , claim and reality , it may not bring the politician down , but it will hurt . For instance : Bill Clinton survived \u201c I did not have sexual relations with that woman , \u201d but he was damaged then , and lastingly , when the truth came out . Knowledge of the risks of being caught has encouraged most politicians to minimize provable lies . None of this works with Donald Trump . He doesn \u2019 t care , and at least so far the institutional GOP hasn \u2019 t either .\nIn that item , \u201c A Reflexive Liar in Command , \u201d and then a follow-up , \u201c Dealing with Trump \u2019 s Lies , \u201d I set out press guidelines for the time ahead . The first one was :\n1 ) Call out lies as lies , not \u201c controversies. \u201d In covering Trump \u2019 s latest illegal-voting outburst [ that \u201c millions of people \u201d had snuck into the polling places and voted , presumably for Democrats ] , The Washington Post and The LA Times took the lead in clearly labeling the claim as false , rather than \u201c controversial \u201d or \u201c unsubstantiated. \u201d ... By contrast .. the NYT takes a more \u201c objective \u201d tone\u2014there \u2019 s \u201c no evidence \u201d for Trump \u2019 s claim , much as there was \u201c no evidence \u201d for his assertion that Ted Cruz \u2019 s dad played a part in the JFK assassination . What \u2019 s the difference ? The NYT said that the claim had \u201c no evidence. \u201d The Post said it was false . The Times \u2019 s is more conventional\u2014but it is also \u201c normalizing \u201d in suggesting that Trump actually cared whether there was evidence for what he said . I think the Post \u2019 s is closer to calling things what they are .\nIt \u2019 s nearly three-and-a-half years later . Everything we saw about Trump on the campaign trail we have seen from him in the White House , including the limitless fantasy-lying .\nI submit that these three-and-a-half years later , much of the press has still not rebuilt itself , to cope with a time or a person like this . Or with a political party like the subservient Trump-era GOP .\nTo choose only a small subset of examples , from only the past three days \u2019 worth of history , here are some illustrations . These are words and deeds that , each on its own , would likely have been major black-mark news events in other eras . Now they are just part of the daily onrush .\n1 ) Us , and them . Two days ago , on March 27 , Donald Trump signed in the Oval Office the most expensive spending bill in American history . Getting it enacted required sustained , major efforts from Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House , and from Chuck Schumer , the Senate minority leader , who got every one of his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill .\nAfter Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get his civil-rights and Medicare legislation through the Congress , he made sure that the Republican leaders from the House and Senate were with him for the signing ceremonies , to receive some of the first pens he used . ( When Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in the Oval Office , he had only Democratic legislators around him\u2014but that was because of near-unanimous Republican opposition to the bill . )\nStructurally Trump \u2019 s situation this week was like LBJ \u2019 s : he was signing a bill the other party had played a crucial role in passing . But when Trump signed the bill yesterday , not a single Democratic legislator was present . Pelosi said she had not been invited .\nEvery other president has tried , at some point , to expand his support beyond those who originally voted for him ( which is why all others have at some point had popularity ratings of 60 percent or 70 percent ) . Every other one has at some point tried to express the interests of the entire public , not just \u201c the base. \u201d Trump has never done either\u2014and that failure is so baked-in that it barely registers now .\nObama used precious months in his first year trying to get GOP support for his medical plan ; he failed ; and a running press critique thereafter was that he should have been doing more to \u201c reach out \u201d to the other side . ( Recall the whole \u201c Have a drink with Mitch McConnell \u201d motif . ) I haven \u2019 t seen any columns fretting about Trump \u2019 s failure to \u201c reach out \u201d to Pelosi or Schumer . \u201c That \u2019 s just Trump . \u201d\n2 ) \u201c If they don \u2019 t treat you right , I don \u2019 t call. \u201d In this past Friday \u2019 s version of his marathon TV sessions\u2014the supposed \u201c health \u201d briefings that have become daily hour-long substitutes for Trump \u2019 s campaign rallies\u2014Trump said that most of the governors now requesting federal aid were friendly to him . But not all , and the ones who weren \u2019 t \u201c appreciative \u201d had better watch their step .\nTrump was asked what he meant about being \u201c appreciative. \u201d His answer ( as you can see starting at time 24:00 of this C-SPAN video ) :\n\u201c Q . You say the governors are not appreciate of what the federal government has done . What more\u2014 \u201c A : [ breaking in } : I think the governor of Washington [ Jay Inslee ] is a failed presidential candidate . He leveled out at zero in the polls . He \u2019 s constantly tripping and\u2014I guess \u2018 complaining \u2019 would be a nice way of saying it\u2026 In Michigan , all she does is\u2014she has no idea what \u2019 s going on . All she does is saying [ whining voice ] \u2018 Oh , it \u2019 s the federal government \u2019 s fault\u2026 \u2019 \u201c I want them to be appreciative . We \u2019 ve done a great job\u2026 \u201c Mike Pence , I don \u2019 t think he sleeps any more . He calls all the governors . I tell him\u2014I \u2019 m a different kind of guy\u2014I tell him , Don \u2019 t call the governor of Washington . You \u2019 re wasting your time with him . \u201c Don \u2019 t call the woman in Michigan\u2026 . \u201c You know what I say , If they don \u2019 t treat you right , I don \u2019 t call . \u201d\nWhat would have made news about this passage in any other era ?\nFirst , the naked favor-trading : What Trump is saying about the states of Washington and Michigan is more or less what led the House to impeach him last year , regarding Ukraine . That is : threatened use of federal power and favors , to reward political friends and punish political enemies\u2014and in this case for unconcealed , openly stated political reasons .\nSecond , the crassness and cruelty , to leaders coping with life-and-death emergencies in their home states . \u201c A failed presidential candidate. \u201d \u201c She has no idea what \u2019 s doing on . \u201d\nThird , the misogyny : Repeatedly avoiding the name of Gretchen Whitmer , elected last year as governor of Michigan , and calling her \u201c the woman in Michigan. \u201d Check the C-SPAN video if you \u2019 re in doubt about the dismissive tone of these remarks , and recall Trump \u2019 s frequent references to \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d and \u201c Crazy Nancy Pelosi . \u201d\nThere was some brief press followup on all these points , but mainly it was again normalized as Trump being Trump .\n3 ) Lies , lies , lies . I \u2019 ll leave to the other chroniclers a complete list of the several dozen lies in Trump \u2019 s live-broadcast appearances in the past few days . On Thursday , he went on at length about the bounty of tariff payments that the U.S. was receiving \u201c from China \u201d \u2014which revealed either a black-is-white misunderstanding of how tariffs work , or a Harry Frankfurt-style indifference to the bullshit of what he was saying . ( None of the White House reporters challenged him about his tariff claim . )\nHere is just one consequential lie to stand for the rest : Trump repeatedly claims , and has done so every day this past week , that no one possibly could have seen this pandemic coming , and that everything was great until just a few weeks ago .\nOf the countless reasons to know this is false , consider this Politico story on the detailed , 69-page playbook the National Security Council had prepared for coping with just this kind of emergency . The exact timing , origin , and biology of this new disease of course came as surprises . But the consequences and choices are ones any competent government would have foreseen .\nJust a month before the 9/11 attacks , in which more than 3,000 people were killed , George W. Bush received a memo famously titled , \u201c Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. \u201d Many years later , press analyses still pointed this out . For years after the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi , in which four Americans died , congressional Republicans held several dozen hearings , to determine whether the Obama administration should have been more prepared .\nIn the past few days \u2019 papers , I see no followup on this NSC report . Press standards for covering Trump have already factored in , and thus implicitly forgiven , the corruption and incompetence .\n4 ) Repeating the mistakes of 2015 . Starting in the summer of 2015 , cable channels began running live Trump rallies , because they were so \u201c interesting. \u201d People watched . Ratings went up . And by Election Day , Trump had received billions of dollars \u2019 worth of free airtime . One calculation of the value was $ 5 billion ; another , $ 2 billion . In either case , a lot .\nWithout this coverage\u2014this decision by TV outlets , to improve their ratings by giving limitless free , live airtime to Trump\u2014he could never have become the Republican nominee , let alone the president .\nTrump himself clearly views the \u201c briefings \u201d about the \u201c virus \u201d \u2014 really , rallies about his greatness\u2014as this year \u2019 s substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold . But the cable and broadcast outlets , as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred , are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by . For more on why this is a mistake , please see this suggestion from Jay Rosen of PressThink , about how the media could shift to \u201c emergency setting \u201d , and this from the Washington Post \u2019 s Erik Wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of Trump telling lies .\nThe media were not built for someone like this . That someone has not changed . The media must change .",

In either case, a lot.\n\nWithout this coverage\u2014this decision by TV outlets, to improve their ratings by giving limitless free, live airtime to Trump\u2014he could never have become the Republican nominee, let alone the president.\n\nTrump himself clearly views the \u201cbriefings\u201d about the \u201cvirus\u201d \u2014 really, rallies about his greatness\u2014as this year\u2019s substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold. But the cable and broadcast outlets, as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred, are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by. For more on why this is a mistake, please see this suggestion from Jay Rosen of PressThink, about how the media could shift to \u201cemergency setting\u201d, and this from the Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of Trump telling lies.\n\nThe media were not built for someone like this. That someone has not changed. The media must change.",
