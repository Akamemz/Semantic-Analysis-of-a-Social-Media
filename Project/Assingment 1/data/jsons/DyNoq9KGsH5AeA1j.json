    "content": "President Trump is proposing to balance the federal budget within 15 years , \u201c shrink \u201d the federal government and extend food stamp work requirements to Medicaid and housing programs in a $ 4.8 trillion spending plan being released Monday .\nThe plan would reduce spending by $ 4.4 trillion equally from discretionary and mandatory programs such as Medicare over the next decade .\nThe plan also includes $ 2 billion for the border wall , with officials saying the administration is approaching 80 % of the money needed to finish the wall .\nThe president \u2019 s budget for fiscal 2021 would cut foreign aid by 21 % and reduce the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s funding by 26 % while targeting the Education Department for smaller cuts .\nAmong the agencies receiving spending increases would be the Department of Homeland Security ( up 3 % ) , the Defense Department ( up 0.3 % to $ 740.5 billion ) , NASA ( up 12 % ) and the Department of Veterans Affairs ( up 13 % ) .\nThe Commerce Department budget would be cut by 37 % . Officials largely attribute that reduction to completion of the census . The Department of Housing and Urban Development is slated for a cut of 15 % in a proposal that includes $ 2.8 billion for homelessness assistance grants .\nSpending for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be cut 9 % , and $ 4.3 billion would be targeted for battling infectious diseases .\nOverall , nondefense spending would be cut 5 % to $ 590 billion , below the level the White House and congressional Democrats agreed to in the current two-year budget deal .\nMr. Trump also proposes to make permanent the tax cuts of 2017 .\nSenior administration officials who gave a preview to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and other news outlets said the election-year proposal is aimed partly at the perception that Mr. Trump hasn \u2019 t tried to curtail federal spending , with annual deficits rising to more than $ 1 trillion in his first term .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to make the case that the president cares about spending and has cared about spending , \u201d a senior administration official said . \u201c He \u2019 s been doing this since his very first budget . This is now the fourth budget . Many of these [ spending ] reforms have been in each and every one of them . We do need Congress . Congress has not been there . \u201d\nThe plan also provides a stark contrast with leading Democratic presidential candidates \u2019 campaign priorities , such as \u201c Medicare-for-All \u201d and free college tuition , which would likely require significant tax increases .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to have a national election that will hopefully decide that Congress is going to be on the side of the American people along with other taxpayers who balance their family budgets , \u201d the senior official said . \u201c We \u2019 re making the argument that deficit reduction is really important . \u201d\nThe plan to reach a balanced budget relies on an optimistic economic forecast of 3 % annual growth , significantly faster than the 2.3 % rate in 2019 .\nOfficials said about half of the proposed savings over a decade would come from reforms or from eliminating programs deemed wasteful in entitlements such as Medicaid and Social Security . They said benefits won \u2019 t be affected and that the savings would come from cutting waste and from other savings such as lowering prescription drug prices under Medicare ( $ 130 billion ) .\nSavings of $ 292 billion would come from reforming Medicaid and other safety net programs , for example by eliminating improper payments to people who have died . Spending on Medicare and Medicaid would still increase .\n\u201c The president is proposing more mandatory savings and reforms than any other president in history , \u201d an official said . \u201c He does protect Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries in those programs ; he totally meets that commitment . \u201d\nThe president tweeted on Saturday , \u201c We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget . Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country \u2019 s greatest ever Economy ! \u201d\nIn the past two years , Congress has provided only $ 2.65 billion for the border wall out of the $ 18 billion the administration said it needed . Mr. Trump declared a state of emergency in February 2019 to move money from military construction projects and counternarcotics programs to get more money . The administration has shifted $ 6.7 billion from those programs and plans to divert another $ 7.2 billion this year .\n\u201c We are in a pretty good place with regard to the main , most critical features of the wall being fully resourced as of right now , \u201d a senior official said . \u201c We will ask for another $ 2 billion just to keep the work going . We \u2019 re approaching 80 % of the wall that will eventually be built being fully resourced . \u201d\nThe proposal would save taxpayers $ 300 billion over 10 years by expanding the 20-hour-per-week work requirement for food stamp recipients to Medicaid and housing programs , plus expanding it in the food stamp program , officials said .\nThe administration said in a statement that part of the spending plan involves \u201c shrinking the federal government to its proper size \u201d by calling for overall reductions of about 2 % .\nDeficits have risen each year under Mr. Trump , who came into office criticizing former President Barack Obama for failing to get government borrowing under control and pledging that he would balance the budget himself in eight years .\nWhen Mr. Obama left office , the annual deficit was down to about $ 585 billion after three consecutive $ 1 trillion deficits at the start of his presidency .\nAfter Mr. Trump took office , the deficit rose to $ 665 billion in fiscal 2017 . It climbed to $ 779 billion in fiscal 2018 , which was 3.8 % of gross domestic product . In 2019 , it rose to $ 984 billion , or 4.6 % of GDP .\nThe trend continued in the wrong direction in the first three months of fiscal 2020 as the deficit widened to $ 356.6 billion and was on pace to exceed $ 1 trillion by the end of the year .\nThe fiscal 2021 budget proposal would trim the deficit to $ 966 billion next year and eliminate annual deficits by 2035 , a senior administration official said .\nMr. Trump threatened to veto a massive spending bill in March 2018 that he said included unnecessary extras added by Democrats . He said he acquiesced because the measure was vital to rebuilding the military , but he warned that he wouldn \u2019 t tolerate such wastefulness going forward .\n\u201c I will never sign a bill like this again , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nHe fought with Democrats into a government shutdown in late 2018 over funding for the border wall . In August , Mr. Trump struck a sweeping two-year spending deal with Democrats that lifted the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit through July 2021 , raised spending by more than $ 320 billion and put off the next potential fight over spending until after the November elections .\nThat deal is projected to add nearly $ 2 trillion in debt over the next decade .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat whose troops have teamed up with Mr. Trump to increase deficit levels , said the president has no credibility on fiscal responsibility . They point to the 2017 tax cuts that passed with no Democratic votes .\n\u201c During the eight years of President Obama \u2019 s presidency , he reduced the deficit by $ 1 trillion , \u201d Mrs. Pelosi said last week . \u201c Instead , this administration \u2026 increased the national debt by $ 2 trillion . \u201d",
