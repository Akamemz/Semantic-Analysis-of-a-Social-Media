    "content": "Few Clinton or Trump Supporters Have Close Friends in the Other Camp\nHow voters are talking \u2013 or arguing \u2013 about the campaign\nIn an increasingly contentious presidential campaign , just a quarter of voters who support Donald Trump in the general election say they have a lot or some close friends who are supporters of Hillary Clinton . Even fewer Clinton backers ( 18 % ) say they have at least some friends who support Trump .\nNearly half of Clinton supporters ( 47 % ) , and 31 % of Trump supporters , say they have no close friends who support the opposing candidate .\nThe survey conducted June 7-July 5 among 4,602 adults , including 3,834 registered voters , on \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s nationally representative American Trends Panel finds that large majorities of both Trump and Clinton supporters have friends who back their preferred candidates .\nMore than four-in-ten Trump supporters ( 44 % ) say they have a lot of close friends who back Trump , while another 38 % say they have some friends who support him . Similarly , most Clinton supporters say they have a lot ( 41 % ) or some close friends ( 40 % ) who also express support for Clinton .\nClinton and Trump backers also are far more likely to talk about the election with those who favor \u201c their \u201d candidate than with those who back the opponent . In the survey , conducted before the party conventions , most voters ( 67 % ) say the election comes up in conversation at least somewhat often , but only 23 % say it comes up very often .\nAbout three-quarters of Trump supporters ( 76 % ) say they have recently had a conversation about the election with a fellow Trump supporter , while only about half as many ( 37 % ) have discussed the election with someone who favors Clinton . Clinton supporters are similarly one-sided in their political discussions : 72 % say recent conversations about the election have been with other Clinton supporters , while just 40 % say they have been with Trump backers .\nFew voters \u2018 hide \u2019 their election preferences . Just 7 % of registered voters say they would \u201c rather other people not know \u201d who they are supporting for president . Most ( 58 % ) say they do not mind if people know who they support , but \u201c don \u2019 t go out of their way to say it. \u201d A third say they are \u201c pretty outspoken with others \u201d about their voting preferences . There are only slight differences between Clinton and Trump supporters in these views .\nSome have had political arguments , but few \u2018 major \u2019 ones . Nearly four-in-ten voters ( 37 % ) \u2013 including nearly identical shares of Clinton and Trump supporters \u2013 say they have had an argument about the election . But just 8 % have had a \u201c major \u201d argument , while 30 % have had a \u201c minor \u201d argument .\nElection discussions focus more on personalities than issues . About six-in-ten voters ( 59 % ) say the discussions about the election have mostly been about the candidates \u2019 personalities and comments ; fewer ( 32 % ) say they have focused on specific issues and policy positions . In this regard , voters are having conversations about the election that reflect what they say they are seeing from the campaign and news coverage of the election . In June , 65 % of voters said the presidential campaign \u201c is not focused on important policy debates , \u201d and in a separate survey , 55 % of adults said there was too little news coverage of the candidates \u2019 stances on issues .\nNearly half of those who intend to vote for Clinton over Trump in November ( 47 % ) say they have no close friends who support Trump , while nearly a third of voters who prefer Trump ( 31 % ) say they have no close friends who back Clinton .\nAmong Clinton supporters , there are wide racial disparities : Fully 72 % of Clinton \u2019 s black supporters say they have no close friends who support Trump . Just 36 % of whites who back Clinton say the same , similar to the share of whites supporting Trump who do not have close friends who back Clinton ( 33 % ) .\nMore black than white Clinton supporters also say they have \u201c a lot \u201d of close friends who support their own candidate ( 59 % vs. 33 % ) .\nClinton supporters who are younger than 30 are more likely than older Clinton backers ( those 50 and older ) to say they have no friends who back Trump ( 58 % vs. 41 % ) . But fewer younger Clinton supporters ( 28 % ) than older Clinton backers ( 47 % of 50+ ) say they have a lot of friends who back Clinton .\nAmong supporters of both Clinton and Trump , less educated voters are more likely than those with more education to say they have no friends who back the opposing candidate .\nA majority of voters ( 58 % ) who currently plan to support either Trump or Clinton say they don \u2019 t mind if people know who they support but that they don \u2019 t go out of their way to say it . A third say that they are \u201c pretty outspoken \u201d with others about their support , while far fewer ( 7 % ) say that they would rather other people not know that they support one of these candidates .\nThere are no significant differences between Clinton and Trump voters on their willingness to share who they support . Majorities of both groups ( 60 % of Clinton supporters and 57 % of Trump supporters ) don \u2019 t mind if others know but don \u2019 t go out of their way to say so .\nOlder voters who back each of the candidates are more likely to be outspoken than younger voters . About four-in-ten ( 39 % ) of voters over 50 are outspoken about their preferences for the election compared with just 20 % of those under 30 .\nIn addition , slightly more than four-in-ten ( 42 % ) of voters with no college experience say they are outspoken , compared with just 26 % of those who have completed college .\nAmong Clinton and Trump supporters , only about a quarter ( 24 % ) who have at least some friends who back the other candidate are \u201c pretty outspoken \u201d about their voting preferences .
