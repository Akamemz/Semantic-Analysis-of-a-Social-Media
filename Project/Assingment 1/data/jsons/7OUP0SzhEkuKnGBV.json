His string of primary victories has been powered by support from voters across racial, economic and geographic groups. There\u2019s one demographic, however, that has overwhelmingly thrown its support behind his opponent Bernie Sanders: young voters.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Sanders received 58 percent of support from voters under 30 to Biden\u2019s 17 percent. Despite winning Michigan's primary a week later by a substantial margin, Biden lost the youth vote in the state by 57 points. The dynamic flips with older voters, who overwhelmingly support Biden over Sanders.\n\nThis enormous divide between generations has worked in Biden\u2019s favor in the primary because older voters have made up a much larger share of the electorate. Sanders has built much of his case on creating a wave of enthusiasm that compels millions of young people to vote for the first time. Biden has collected a commanding lead in the race in part because that boom in youth turnout hasn\u2019t come to pass.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nBiden can win the primary without young voters, but he\u2019ll almost certainly need them to defeat Donald Trump in the general election. While it\u2019s unlikely too many young Sanders supporters would flip to Trump, enough of them may stay home on Election Day to tip the scales. Younger voters are generally more liberal, antiestablishment and more likely to support sweeping changes to American democracy. Many of them may be turned off by Biden\u2019s center-left policies and long history as a Washington insider.
