I want you to see everything with your own eyes . \u201d\nThe surreptitiously taped conversations reveal an extraordinary departure from traditional policy , in which the U.S. government speaks to foreign governments with one voice coordinated by the State Department .\nInstead , the tapes show that the Pentagon \u2019 s senior uniformed leadership and a congressman from Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s own party conveyed sentiments to the Libyan regime that undercut or conflicted with the secretary of state \u2019 s own message at the time .\n\u201c If this story is true , it would be highly unusual for the Pentagon to conduct a separate set of diplomatic negotiations , given the way we operated when I was secretary of state , \u201d James A. Baker III , who served under President George H.W . Bush , told The Times . \u201c In our administration , the president made sure that we all sang from the same hymnal . \u201d\nMr. Kucinich , who challenged Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , acknowledged that he undertook his own conversations with the Gadhafi regime . He said he feared Mrs. Clinton was using emotion to sell a war against Libya that wasn \u2019 t warranted , and he wanted to get all the information he could to share with his congressional colleagues .\n\u201c I had facts that indicated America was headed once again into an intervention that was going to be disastrous , \u201d Mr. Kucinich told The Times . \u201c What was being said at the State Department \u2014 if you look at the charge at the time \u2014 it wasn \u2019 t so much about what happened as it was about what would happen . So there was a distortion of events that were occurring in Libya to justify an intervention which was essentially wrong and illegal . \u201d\nMr. Kucinich wrote a letter to Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton in August explaining his communications in a last-ditch effort to stop the war .\n\u201c I have been contacted by an intermediary in Libya who has indicated that President Muammar Gadhafi is willing to negotiate an end to the conflict under conditions which would seem to favor Administration policy , \u201d Mr. Kucinich wrote on Aug. 24 .\nNeither the White House nor the State Department responded to his letter , he said .\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to provide any comment about the recordings .\nThe State Department also declined to answer questions about separate contacts from the Pentagon and Mr. Kucinich with the Gadhafi regime , but said the goal of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama was regime change in Libya .\n\u201c U.S . policy during the revolution supported regime change through peaceful means , in line with UNSCR 1973 policy and NATO mission goals , \u201d the State Department said . \u201c We consistently emphasized at the time that Moammar Gadhafi had to step down and leave Libya as an essential component of the transition . \u201d\nBoth inside and outside the Obama administration , Mrs. Clinton was among the most vocal early proponents of using U.S. military force to unseat Gadhafi . Joining her in making the case were French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , and her successor as secretary of state , John F. Kerry .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s main argument was that Gadhafi was about to engage in a genocide against civilians in Benghazi , where the rebels held their center of power . But defense intelligence officials could not corroborate those concerns and in fact assessed that Gadhafi was unlikely to risk world outrage by inflicting mass casualties , officials told The Times . As a result , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , strongly opposed Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s recommendation to use force .\nIf Mrs. Clinton runs for president next year , her style of leadership as it relates to foreign policy will be viewed through the one war that she personally championed as secretary of state . Among the key questions every candidate faces is how they will assess U.S. intelligence and solicit the advice of the military leadership .\nNumerous U.S. officials interviewed by The Times confirmed that Mrs. Clinton , and not Mr. Obama , led the charge to use NATO military force to unseat Gadhafi as Libya \u2019 s leader and that she repeatedly dismissed the warnings offered by career military and intelligence officials .\nIn the recovered recordings , a U.S. intelligence liaison working for the Pentagon told a Gadhafi aide that Mr. Obama privately informed members of Congress that Libya \u201c is all Secretary Clinton \u2019 s matter \u201d and that the nation \u2019 s highest-ranking generals were concerned that the president was being misinformed .\nThe Pentagon liaison indicated on the tapes that Army Gen. Charles H. Jacoby Jr. , a top aide to Adm. Mullen , \u201c does not trust the reports that are coming out of the State Department and CIA , but there \u2019 s nothing he can do about it . \u201d\nIn one conversation to the Libyans , the American intelligence asset said , \u201c I can tell you that the president is not getting accurate information , so at some point someone has to get accurate information to him . I think about a way through former Secretary Gates or maybe to Adm. Mullen to get him information \u201d\nThe recordings are consistent with what many high-ranking intelligence , military and academic sources told The Times :\nMrs. Clinton was headstrong to enter the Libyan crisis , ignoring the Pentagon \u2019 s warnings that no U.S. interests were at stake and regional stability could be threatened . Instead , she relied heavily on the assurances of the Libyan rebels and her own memory of Rwanda , where U.S. inaction may have led to the genocide of at least 500,000 people .\n\u201c Neither the intervention decision nor the regime change decision was an intelligence-heavy decision , \u201d said one senior intelligence official directly involved with the administration \u2019 s decision-making , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . \u201c People weren \u2019 t on the edge of their seats , intelligence wasn \u2019 t driving the decision one way or another . \u201d\nInstead of relying on the Defense Department or the intelligence community for analysis , officials told The Times , the White House trusted Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s charge , which was then supported by Ambassador to the United Nations Susan E. Rice and National Security Council member Samantha Power , as reason enough for war .\n\u201c Susan Rice was involved in the Rwanda crisis in 1994 , Samantha Power wrote very moving books about what happened in Rwanda , and Hillary Clinton was also in the background of that crisis as well , \u201d said Allen Lynch , a professor of international relations at the University of Virginia . \u201c I think they have all carried this with them as a kind of guilt complex . \u201d\nIn 2003 , Gadhafi agreed to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction and denounce terrorism to re-establish relations with the West . He later made reparations to the families of those who died in the bombing of Pan-Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland .\nNews media frequently described the apparent transformation as Libya \u201c coming in from the cold . \u201d\nStill , he ruled Libya with an iron grip , and by February 2011 civil war raged throughout the country . Loyalist forces mobilized tanks and troops toward Benghazi , creating a panicked mass exodus of civilians toward Egypt .\nMrs. Clinton met with Libyan rebel spokesman Mahmoud Jibril in the Paris Westin hotel in mid-March so she could vet the rebel cause to unseat Gadhafi . Forty-five minutes after speaking with Mr. Jibril , Mrs. Clinton was convinced that a military intervention was needed .\n\u201c I talked extensively about the dreams of a democratic civil state where all Libyans are equal a political participatory system with no exclusions of any Libyans , even the followers of Gadhafi who did not commit crimes against the Libyan people , and how the international community should protect civilians from a possible genocide like the one [ that ] took place in Rwanda , \u201d Mr. Jibril told The Times . \u201c I felt by the end of the meeting , I passed the test . Benghazi was saved . \u201d\nSo on March 17 , 2011 , the U.S. supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya to help protect its people from Gadhafi \u2019 s forthcoming march on Benghazi , where he threatened he would \u201c show no mercy \u201d to resisters .\n\u201c In this particular country \u2014 Libya \u2014 at this particular moment , we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale , \u201d Mr. Obama declared in an address to the nation on March 28 . \u201c We had a unique ability to stop that violence : An international mandate for action , a broad coalition prepared to join us , the support of Arab countries and a plea for help from the Libyan people themselves . \u201d\nYet Human Rights Watch did not see the humanitarian crisis as imminent .\n\u201c At that point , we did not see the imminence of massacres that would rise to genocidelike levels , \u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson , executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division for Human Rights Watch . \u201c Gadhafi \u2019 s forces killed hundreds of overwhelmingly unarmed protesters . There were threats of Libyan forces approaching Benghazi , but we didn \u2019 t feel that rose to the level of imminent genocidelike atrocities . \u201d\nInstead , she said , the U.S. government was trying to be at the forefront of the Arab Spring , when many dictator-led countries were turning to democracy .\n\u201c I think the dynamic for the U.S. government was : Things are changing fast , Tunisia has fallen , Egypt has fallen , and we \u2019 d better be on the front of this , supporting a new government and not being seen as supporting the old government , \u201d Ms. Whitson said .\nOn the day the U.N. resolution was passed , Mrs. Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call with Gadhafi \u2019 s son Seif and other high-level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution , the secret recordings reveal .\nA day later , on March 18 , Gadhafi called for a cease-fire , another action the administration dismissed .\nSoon , a call was set up between the former U.S. ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , and Gadhafi confidant Mohammed Ismael during which Mr. Ismael confirmed that the regime \u2019 s highest-ranking generals were under orders not to fire upon protesters .\n\u201c I told him we were not targeting civilians and Seif told him that , \u201d Mr. Ismael told The Times in an telephone interview this month , recounting the fateful conversation .\nWhile Mrs. Clinton urged the Pentagon to cease its communications with the Gadhafi regime , the intelligence asset working with the Joint Chiefs remained in contact for months afterward .\n\u201c Everything I am getting from the State Department is that they do not care about being part of this . Secretary Clinton does not want to negotiate at all , \u201d the Pentagon intelligence asset told Seif Gadhafi and his adviser on the recordings .\nCommunication was so torn between the Libyan regime and the State Department that they had no point of contact within the department to even communicate whether they were willing to accept the U.N. \u2019 s mandates , former Libyan officials said .\nMrs. Clinton eventually named Mr. Cretz as the official U.S. point of contact for the Gadhafi regime . Mr. Cretz , the former ambassador to Libya , was removed from the country in 2010 amid Libyan anger over derogatory comments he made regarding Gadhafi released by Wikileaks . As a result , Mr. Cretz was not trusted or liked by the family .\nShutting the Gadhafis out of the conversation allowed Mrs. Clinton to pursue a solitary point of view , said a senior Pentagon official directly involved with the intervention .\n\u201c The decision to invade [ Libya ] had already been made , so everything coming out of the State Department at that time was to reinforce that decision , \u201d the official explained , speaking only on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution .\nAs a result , the Pentagon went its own way and established communications with Seif Gadhafi through one of his friends , a U.S. businessman , who acted as an intermediary . The goal was to identify a clear path and strategy forward in Libya \u2014 something that wasn \u2019 t articulated by the White House or State Department at the time , officials said .\n\u201c Our big thing was : \u2018 What \u2019 s a good way out of this , what \u2019 s a bridge to post-Gadhafi conflict once the military stops and the civilians take over , what \u2019 s it going to look like ? \u2019 \u201d said a senior military official involved in the planning , who requested anonymity . \u201c We had a hard time coming up with that because once again nobody knew what the lay of the clans and stuff was going to be .\n\u201c The impression we got from both the businessman and from Seif was that the situation is bad , but this [ NATO intervention ] is even worse , \u201d the official said , confirming the sentiments expressed on the audio recordings . \u201c All of these things don \u2019 t have to happen this way , and it will be better for Libya in the long run both economically and politically if they didn \u2019 t . \u201d\nThe week the U.N. resolution authorizing military force was passed , Sen. Jim Webb , Virginia Democrat , expressed his own concerns .\n\u201c We have a military operation that \u2019 s been put to play , but we do not have a clear diplomatic policy or clear statement of foreign policy . We know we don \u2019 t like the Gadhafi regime , but we do not have a picture of who the opposition movement really is . We got a vote from the Security Council but we had five key abstentions in that vote . \u201d\nFive of the 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council abstained from voting on the decision in Libya because they had concerns that the NATO intervention would make things worse . Mrs. Clinton worked to avoid having them exercise their veto by personally calling representatives from Security Council member states .\nGermany and Brazil published statements on March 18 , 2011 , explaining their reasons for abstention .\n\u201c We weighed the risks of a military operation as a whole , not just for Libya but , of course , also with respect to the consequences for the entire region and that is why we abstained , \u201d Germany said .\nBrazil wrote , \u201c We are not convinced that the use of force as contemplated in the present resolution will lead to the realization of our most important objective \u2014 the immediate end of violence and the protection of civilians .\nWe are also concerned that such measures may have the unintended effect of exacerbating tensions on the ground and causing more harm than good to the very same civilians we are committed to protecting . \u201d\nSergey Ivanovich Kislyak , Russia \u2019 s ambassador to the U.S. , told The Times that history has proved those concerns correct .\n\u201c The U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya was meant to create a no-fly zone to prevent bombing of civilians , \u201d said Mr. Kislyak . \u201c NATO countries that participated in this intervention were supposed to patrol the area . However , in a short amount of time the NATO flights \u2014 initially meant to stop violence on the ground \u2014 went far beyond the scope of the Security Council-mandated task and created even more violence in Libya . \u201d\nOn March 19 , the U.S. military , supported by France and Britain , fired off more than 110 Tomahawk missiles , hitting about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets . Within weeks , a NATO airstrike killed one of Gaddafi \u2019 s sons and three grandsons at their the family \u2019 s Tripoli compound , sparking debate about whether the colonel and his family were legitimate targets under the U.N. resolution .\nMr. Gates , the defense secretary , said the compound was targeted because it included command-and-control facilities .\nEven after the conflict began , U.S. military leaders kept looking for a way out and a way to avoid the power vacuum that would be left in the region if Gadhafi fell .\nAs the intelligence asset working with the Joint Chiefs kept his contacts going , one U.S. general made an attempt to negotiate directly with his Libyan military counterparts , according to interviews conducted by The Times with officials directly familiar with the overture .\nArmy Gen. Carter Ham , the head of the U.S. African Command , sought to set up a 72-hour truce with the regime , according to an intermediary called in to help .\nRetired Navy Rear Adm. Charles Kubic , who was acting as a business consultant in Libya at the time , said he was approached by senior Libyan military leaders to propose the truce . He took the plan to Lt. Col. Brian Linvill , the U.S. AFRICOM point of contact for Libya . Col. Linvill passed the proposal to Gen. Ham , who agreed to participate .\n\u201c The Libyans would stop all combat operations and withdraw all military forces to the outskirts of the cities and assume a defensive posture . Then to insure the credibility with the international community , the Libyans would accept recipients from the African Union to make sure the truce was honored , \u201d Mr. Kubic said , describing the offers .\n\u201c [ Gadhafi ] came back and said he was willing to step down and permit a transition government , but he had two conditions , \u201d Mr. Kubic said . \u201c First was to insure there was a military force left over after he left Libya capable to go after al Qaeda . Secondly , he wanted to have the sanctions against him and his family and those loyal to him lifted and free passage . At that point in time , everybody thought that was reasonable . \u201d\nGen. Ham was ordered to stand down two days after the negotiation began , Mr. Kubic said . The orders were given at the behest of the State Department , according to those familiar with the plan in the Pentagon . Gen. Ham declined to comment when questioned by The Times .\n\u201c If their goal was to get Gadhafi out of power , then why not give a 72-hour truce a try ? \u201d Mr. Kubic asked . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t enough to get him out of power ; they wanted him dead . \u201d\nLibyan officials were willing to negotiate a departure from power but felt the continued NATO bombings were forcing the regime into combat to defend itself , the recordings indicated .\n\u201c If they put us in a corner , we have no choice but to fight until the end , \u201d Mr. Ismael said on one of the recordings . \u201c What more can they do ? Bomb us with a nuclear bomb ? They have done everything . \u201d\nUnder immense foreign firepower , the Gadhafi regime \u2019 s grip on Libya began to slip in early April and the rebels \u2019 resolve was strengthened . Gadhafi pleaded with the U.S. to stop the NATO airstrikes .\nIndeed , the U.S. position in Libya had changed . First , it was presented to the public as way to stop an impending humanitarian crisis but evolved into expelling the Gadhafis .\nCIA Director Leon E. Panetta says in his book \u201c Worthy Fights \u201d that the goal of the Libyan conflict was for regime change . Mr. Panetta wrote that at the end of his first week as secretary of defense in July 2011 , he visited Iraq and Afghanistan \u201c for both substance and symbolism . \u201d\n\u201c In Afghanistan I misstated our position on how fast we \u2019 d be bringing troops home , and I said what everyone in Washington knew , but we couldn \u2019 t officially acknowledge : That our goal in Libya was regime change . \u201d\nInstead : \u201c It was \u2018 We \u2019 re worried a humanitarian crisis might occur , \u2019 \u201d said a senior military official , reflecting on the conflict . \u201c Once you \u2019 ve got everybody nodding up and down on that , watch out because you can justify almost anything under the auspices of working to prevent a humanitarian crisis . Gadhafi had enough craziness about him , the rest of the world nodded on . \u201d\nBut they might not be so quick to approve again , officials say .\n\u201c It may be impossible to get the same kind of resolution in similar circumstances , and we already saw that in Syria where the Russians were very suspicious when Western powers went to the U.N. , \u201d said Richard Northern , who served as the British ambassador to Libya during part of the conflict . \u201c Anything the Western powers did in the Middle East is now viewed by the Russians with suspicion , and it will probably reduce the level of authority they \u2019 re willing to give in connection to humanitarian crises . \u201d\nMr. Kucinich , who took several steps to end the war in Libya , said he is sickened about what transpired .\nHe sponsored a June 3 resolution in the House of Representatives to end the Libyan war , but Republican support for the bill was diluted after Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , proposed a softer alternative resolution demanding that the president justify his case for war within 14 days .\n\u201c There was a distortion of events that were occurring in Libya to justify an intervention which was essentially wrong and illegal because [ the administration ] gained the support of the U.N. Security Council through misrepresentation , \u201d said Mr. Kucinich . \u201c The die was cast there for the overthrow of the Gadhafi government . The die was cast . They weren \u2019 t looking for any information .\n\u201c What \u2019 s interesting about all this is , if you listen to Seif Gaddafi \u2019 s account , even as they were being bombed they still trusted America , which really says a lot , \u201d said Mr. Kucinich . \u201c It says a lot about how people who are being bombed through the covert involvement or backdoor involvement of the U.S. will still trust the U.S. It \u2019 s heart-breaking , really . It really breaks your heart when you see trust that is so cynically manipulated . \u201d\nIn August , Gadhafi \u2019 s compound in Tripoli was overrun , signaling the end of his 42-year reign and forcing him into hiding . Two months later , Gadhafi , 69 , was killed in his hometown of Sirte . His son Seif was captured by the Zintan tribe and remains in solitary confinement in a Zintan prison cell .\nSince Gadhafi was removed from power , Libya has been in a constant state of chaos , with factional infighting and no uniting leader . On Tuesday , an attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli killed nine people , including one American . A group calling itself the Islamic State-Tripoli Province took responsibility for the attack , indicating a growing presence of anti-American terrorist groups within the country .",

Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly opposed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recommendation to use force.\n\nIf Mrs. Clinton runs for president next year, her style of leadership as it relates to foreign policy will be viewed through the one war that she personally championed as secretary of state. Among the key questions every candidate faces is how they will assess U.S. intelligence and solicit the advice of the military leadership.\n\nNumerous U.S. officials interviewed by The Times confirmed that Mrs. Clinton, and not Mr. Obama, led the charge to use NATO military force to unseat Gadhafi as Libya\u2019s leader and that she repeatedly dismissed the warnings offered by career military and intelligence officials.\n\nIn the recovered recordings, a U.S. intelligence liaison working for the Pentagon told a Gadhafi aide that Mr. Obama privately informed members of Congress that Libya \u201cis all Secretary Clinton\u2019s matter\u201d and that the nation\u2019s highest-ranking generals were concerned that the president was being misinformed.\n\nThe Pentagon liaison indicated on the tapes that Army Gen. Charles H. Jacoby Jr., a top aide to Adm. Mullen, \u201cdoes not trust the reports that are coming out of the State Department and CIA, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.\u201d\n\nIn one conversation to the Libyans, the American intelligence asset said, \u201cI can tell you that the president is not getting accurate information, so at some point someone has to get accurate information to him. I think about a way through former Secretary Gates or maybe to Adm. Mullen to get him information\u201d\n\nThe recordings are consistent with what many high-ranking intelligence, military and academic sources told The Times:\n\nMrs. Clinton was headstrong to enter the Libyan crisis, ignoring the Pentagon\u2019s warnings that no U.S. interests were at stake and regional stability could be threatened. Instead, she relied heavily on the assurances of the Libyan rebels and her own memory of Rwanda, where U.S. inaction may have led to the genocide of at least 500,000 people.\n\n\u201cNeither the intervention decision nor the regime change decision was an intelligence-heavy decision,\u201d said one senior intelligence official directly involved with the administration\u2019s decision-making, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t on the edge of their seats, intelligence wasn\u2019t driving the decision one way or another.\u201d\n\nInstead of relying on the Defense Department or the intelligence community for analysis, officials told The Times, the White House trusted Mrs. Clinton\u2019s charge, which was then supported by Ambassador to the United Nations Susan E. Rice and National Security Council member Samantha Power, as reason enough for war.\n\n\u201cSusan Rice was involved in the Rwanda crisis in 1994, Samantha Power wrote very moving books about what happened in Rwanda, and Hillary Clinton was also in the background of that crisis as well,\u201d said Allen Lynch, a professor of international relations at the University of Virginia. \u201cI think they have all carried this with them as a kind of guilt complex.\u201d\n\nHumanitarian crisis was not imminent\n\nIn 2003, Gadhafi agreed to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction and denounce terrorism to re-establish relations with the West. He later made reparations to the families of those who died in the bombing of Pan-Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n\nNews media frequently described the apparent transformation as Libya \u201ccoming in from the cold.\u201d\n\nStill, he ruled Libya with an iron grip, and by February 2011 civil war raged throughout the country. Loyalist forces mobilized tanks and troops toward Benghazi, creating a panicked mass exodus of civilians toward Egypt.\n\nMrs. Clinton met with Libyan rebel spokesman Mahmoud Jibril in the Paris Westin hotel in mid-March so she could vet the rebel cause to unseat Gadhafi. Forty-five minutes after speaking with Mr. Jibril, Mrs. Clinton was convinced that a military intervention was needed.\n\n\u201cI talked extensively about the dreams of a democratic civil state where all Libyans are equal a political participatory system with no exclusions of any Libyans, even the followers of Gadhafi who did not commit crimes against the Libyan people, and how the international community should protect civilians from a possible genocide like the one [that] took place in Rwanda,\u201d Mr. Jibril told The Times. \u201cI felt by the end of the meeting, I passed the test. Benghazi was saved.\u201d\n\nSo on March 17, 2011, the U.S. supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya to help protect its people from Gadhafi\u2019s forthcoming march on Benghazi, where he threatened he would \u201cshow no mercy\u201d to resisters.\n\n\u201cIn this particular country \u2014 Libya \u2014 at this particular moment, we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale,\u201d Mr. Obama declared in an address to the nation on March 28. \u201cWe had a unique ability to stop that violence: An international mandate for action, a broad coalition prepared to join us, the support of Arab countries and a plea for help from the Libyan people themselves.\u201d\n\nYet Human Rights Watch did not see the humanitarian crisis as imminent.\n\n\u201cAt that point, we did not see the imminence of massacres that would rise to genocidelike levels,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division for Human Rights Watch. \u201cGadhafi\u2019s forces killed hundreds of overwhelmingly unarmed protesters. There were threats of Libyan forces approaching Benghazi, but we didn\u2019t feel that rose to the level of imminent genocidelike atrocities.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, the U.S. government was trying to be at the forefront of the Arab Spring, when many dictator-led countries were turning to democracy.\n\n\u201cI think the dynamic for the U.S. government was: Things are changing fast, Tunisia has fallen, Egypt has fallen, and we\u2019d better be on the front of this, supporting a new government and not being seen as supporting the old government,\u201d Ms. Whitson said.\n\nClinton blocks Gadhafi outreach\n\nOn the day the U.N. resolution was passed, Mrs. Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call with Gadhafi\u2019s son Seif and other high-level members within the regime, to help negotiate a resolution, the secret recordings reveal.\n\nA day later, on March 18, Gadhafi called for a cease-fire, another action the administration dismissed.\n\nSoon, a call was set up between the former U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz, and Gadhafi confidant Mohammed Ismael during which Mr. Ismael confirmed that the regime\u2019s highest-ranking generals were under orders not to fire upon protesters.\n\n\u201cI told him we were not targeting civilians and Seif told him that,\u201d Mr. Ismael told The Times in an telephone interview this month, recounting the fateful conversation.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton urged the Pentagon to cease its communications with the Gadhafi regime, the intelligence asset working with the Joint Chiefs remained in contact for months afterward.\n\n\u201cEverything I am getting from the State Department is that they do not care about being part of this. Secretary Clinton does not want to negotiate at all,\u201d the Pentagon intelligence asset told Seif Gadhafi and his adviser on the recordings.\n\nCommunication was so torn between the Libyan regime and the State Department that they had no point of contact within the department to even communicate whether they were willing to accept the U.N.\u2019s mandates, former Libyan officials said.\n\nMrs. Clinton eventually named Mr. Cretz as the official U.S. point of contact for the Gadhafi regime. Mr. Cretz, the former ambassador to Libya, was removed from the country in 2010 amid Libyan anger over derogatory comments he made regarding Gadhafi released by Wikileaks. As a result, Mr. Cretz was not trusted or liked by the family.\n\nShutting the Gadhafis out of the conversation allowed Mrs. Clinton to pursue a solitary point of view, said a senior Pentagon official directly involved with the intervention.\n\n\u201cThe decision to invade [Libya] had already been made, so everything coming out of the State Department at that time was to reinforce that decision,\u201d the official explained, speaking only on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nAs a result, the Pentagon went its own way and established communications with Seif Gadhafi through one of his friends, a U.S. businessman, who acted as an intermediary. The goal was to identify a clear path and strategy forward in Libya \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t articulated by the White House or State Department at the time, officials said.\n\n\u201cOur big thing was: \u2018What\u2019s a good way out of this, what\u2019s a bridge to post-Gadhafi conflict once the military stops and the civilians take over, what\u2019s it going to look like?\u2019\u201d said a senior military official involved in the planning, who requested anonymity. \u201cWe had a hard time coming up with that because once again nobody knew what the lay of the clans and stuff was going to be.\n\n\u201cThe impression we got from both the businessman and from Seif was that the situation is bad, but this [NATO intervention] is even worse,\u201d the official said, confirming the sentiments expressed on the audio recordings. \u201cAll of these things don\u2019t have to happen this way, and it will be better for Libya in the long run both economically and politically if they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPentagon looks for a way out\n\nThe Pentagon wasn\u2019t alone in questioning the intervention.\n\nThe week the U.N. resolution authorizing military force was passed, Sen. Jim Webb, Virginia Democrat, expressed his own concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have a military operation that\u2019s been put to play, but we do not have a clear diplomatic policy or clear statement of foreign policy. We know we don\u2019t like the Gadhafi regime, but we do not have a picture of who the opposition movement really is. We got a vote from the Security Council but we had five key abstentions in that vote.\u201d\n\nFive of the 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council abstained from voting on the decision in Libya because they had concerns that the NATO intervention would make things worse. Mrs. Clinton worked to avoid having them exercise their veto by personally calling representatives from Security Council member states.\n\nGermany and Brazil published statements on March 18, 2011, explaining their reasons for abstention.\n\n\u201cWe weighed the risks of a military operation as a whole, not just for Libya but, of course, also with respect to the consequences for the entire region and that is why we abstained,\u201d Germany said.\n\nBrazil wrote, \u201cWe are not convinced that the use of force as contemplated in the present resolution will lead to the realization of our most important objective \u2014 the immediate end of violence and the protection of civilians.\n\nWe are also concerned that such measures may have the unintended effect of exacerbating tensions on the ground and causing more harm than good to the very same civilians we are committed to protecting.\u201d\n\nSergey Ivanovich Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., told The Times that history has proved those concerns correct.\n\n\u201cThe U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya was meant to create a no-fly zone to prevent bombing of civilians,\u201d said Mr. Kislyak. \u201cNATO countries that participated in this intervention were supposed to patrol the area. However, in a short amount of time the NATO flights \u2014 initially meant to stop violence on the ground \u2014 went far beyond the scope of the Security Council-mandated task and created even more violence in Libya.\u201d\n\nOn March 19, the U.S. military, supported by France and Britain, fired off more than 110 Tomahawk missiles, hitting about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets. Within weeks, a NATO airstrike killed one of Gaddafi\u2019s sons and three grandsons at their the family\u2019s Tripoli compound, sparking debate about whether the colonel and his family were legitimate targets under the U.N. resolution.\n\nMr. Gates, the defense secretary, said the compound was targeted because it included command-and-control facilities.\n\nEven after the conflict began, U.S. military leaders kept looking for a way out and a way to avoid the power vacuum that would be left in the region if Gadhafi fell.\n\nAs the intelligence asset working with the Joint Chiefs kept his contacts going, one U.S. general made an attempt to negotiate directly with his Libyan military counterparts, according to interviews conducted by The Times with officials directly familiar with the overture.\n\nArmy Gen. Carter Ham, the head of the U.S. African Command, sought to set up a 72-hour truce with the regime, according to an intermediary called in to help.\n\nRetired Navy Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, who was acting as a business consultant in Libya at the time, said he was approached by senior Libyan military leaders to propose the truce. He took the plan to Lt. Col. Brian Linvill, the U.S. AFRICOM point of contact for Libya. Col. Linvill passed the proposal to Gen. Ham, who agreed to participate.\n\n\u201cThe Libyans would stop all combat operations and withdraw all military forces to the outskirts of the cities and assume a defensive posture. Then to insure the credibility with the international community, the Libyans would accept recipients from the African Union to make sure the truce was honored,\u201d Mr. Kubic said, describing the offers.\n\n\u201c[Gadhafi] came back and said he was willing to step down and permit a transition government, but he had two conditions,\u201d Mr. Kubic said. \u201cFirst was to insure there was a military force left over after he left Libya capable to go after al Qaeda. Secondly, he wanted to have the sanctions against him and his family and those loyal to him lifted and free passage. At that point in time, everybody thought that was reasonable.\u201d\n\nBut not the State Department.\n\nGen. Ham was ordered to stand down two days after the negotiation began, Mr. Kubic said. The orders were given at the behest of the State Department, according to those familiar with the plan in the Pentagon. Gen. Ham declined to comment when questioned by The Times.\n\n\u201cIf their goal was to get Gadhafi out of power, then why not give a 72-hour truce a try?\u201d Mr. Kubic asked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough to get him out of power; they wanted him dead.\u201d\n\nLibyan officials were willing to negotiate a departure from power but felt the continued NATO bombings were forcing the regime into combat to defend itself, the recordings indicated.\n\n\u201cIf they put us in a corner, we have no choice but to fight until the end,\u201d Mr. Ismael said on one of the recordings. \u201cWhat more can they do? Bomb us with a nuclear bomb? They have done everything.\u201d\n\nUnder immense foreign firepower, the Gadhafi regime\u2019s grip on Libya began to slip in early April and the rebels\u2019 resolve was strengthened. Gadhafi pleaded with the U.S. to stop the NATO airstrikes.\n\nRegime change real agenda\n\nIndeed, the U.S. position in Libya had changed. First, it was presented to the public as way to stop an impending humanitarian crisis but evolved into expelling the Gadhafis.\n\nCIA Director Leon E. Panetta says in his book \u201cWorthy Fights\u201d that the goal of the Libyan conflict was for regime change. Mr. Panetta wrote that at the end of his first week as secretary of defense in July 2011, he visited Iraq and Afghanistan \u201cfor both substance and symbolism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Afghanistan I misstated our position on how fast we\u2019d be bringing troops home, and I said what everyone in Washington knew, but we couldn\u2019t officially acknowledge: That our goal in Libya was regime change.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the official war cry.\n\nInstead: \u201cIt was \u2018We\u2019re worried a humanitarian crisis might occur,\u2019\u201d said a senior military official, reflecting on the conflict. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got everybody nodding up and down on that, watch out because you can justify almost anything under the auspices of working to prevent a humanitarian crisis. Gadhafi had enough craziness about him, the rest of the world nodded on.\u201d\n\nBut they might not be so quick to approve again, officials say.\n\n\u201cIt may be impossible to get the same kind of resolution in similar circumstances, and we already saw that in Syria where the Russians were very suspicious when Western powers went to the U.N.,\u201d said Richard Northern, who served as the British ambassador to Libya during part of the conflict. \u201cAnything the Western powers did in the Middle East is now viewed by the Russians with suspicion, and it will probably reduce the level of authority they\u2019re willing to give in connection to humanitarian crises.\u201d\n\nMr. Kucinich, who took several steps to end the war in Libya, said he is sickened about what transpired.\n\nHe sponsored a June 3 resolution in the House of Representatives to end the Libyan war, but Republican support for the bill was diluted after Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, proposed a softer alternative resolution demanding that the president justify his case for war within 14 days.\n\n\u201cThere was a distortion of events that were occurring in Libya to justify an intervention which was essentially wrong and illegal because [the administration] gained the support of the U.N. Security Council through misrepresentation,\u201d said Mr. Kucinich. \u201cThe die was cast there for the overthrow of the Gadhafi government. The die was cast. They weren\u2019t looking for any information.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about all this is, if you listen to Seif Gaddafi\u2019s account, even as they were being bombed they still trusted America, which really says a lot,\u201d said Mr. Kucinich. \u201cIt says a lot about how people who are being bombed through the covert involvement or backdoor involvement of the U.S. will still trust the U.S. It\u2019s heart-breaking, really. It really breaks your heart when you see trust that is so cynically manipulated.\u201d\n\nIn August, Gadhafi\u2019s compound in Tripoli was overrun, signaling the end of his 42-year reign and forcing him into hiding. Two months later, Gadhafi, 69, was killed in his hometown of Sirte. His son Seif was captured by the Zintan tribe and remains in solitary confinement in a Zintan prison cell.\n\nSince Gadhafi was removed from power, Libya has been in a constant state of chaos, with factional infighting and no uniting leader. On Tuesday, an attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli killed nine people, including one American. A group calling itself the Islamic State-Tripoli Province took responsibility for the attack, indicating a growing presence of anti-American terrorist groups within the country.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
