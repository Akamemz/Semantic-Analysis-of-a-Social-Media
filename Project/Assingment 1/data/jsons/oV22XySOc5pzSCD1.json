    "content": "Within a year , North Korea will have operational missiles capable of threatening the American homeland . In addition , their ongoing nuclear program generates bombs that could fall into the hands of anti-Western terrorists or Iran . There are only four possible courses of action : taking unilateral military action , persuading the North Koreans to give up their nuclear program , accepting a nuclear North Korea , and collaborating with other countries to arrive at a new political solution .\nAny unilateral military action by the U.S. would quickly escalate into war , since Kim Jong-Un would certainly retaliate . A war would be extremely costly . Millions of tons of DPRK ( North Korea ) ordinance and 17,000 artillery pieces are aimed at Seoul , just 35 miles from the border with North Korea . The 28,000 American troops in Korea would suffer huge casualties , and millions of Koreans would die .\nWe have attempted , without success , to use diplomatic and economic pressure to persuade the North Koreans . The Kim regime realizes that nuclear weapons are its best defense against future American pressure . The latest UN sanctions will hurt the North Korean population but will have no effect on the regime \u2019 s nuclear program .\nAs for accepting a nuclear DPNK , there is no guarantee that this would work , given that it is ruled by a madman . Tens of millions of Americans in Alaska and the West Coast would live under constant threat of nuclear annihilation .\nThis leaves only one viable option : an end to the Kim Jong-Un regime through a cooperative effort of the U.S. and China . North Korea receives 90 % of its foreign exchange from China . North Korea \u2019 s military depends on spare parts and technical support from China . China has military assets that could threaten the regime across its undefended northern boundary . We and the Chinese could jointly impose upon the entire Korean peninsula a political solution , with a drawing down of military forces on both sides and the introduction of power-sharing and coalition government between North and South , finally bringing the Korean war that began in 1950 to an official end .\nThe Chinese won \u2019 t help us out of the goodness of their hearts , of course . They have little or no strategic benefit to be gained by the elimination of the DPRK threat , and leaving things as they are permits them to shake us down on trade negotiations . For twenty years we \u2019 ve appealed to appeal to our \u201c common interest \u201d in eliminating North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program , but this badly misreads the strategic point of view of China . To China , North Korea is a crucial strategic asset in their competition with us in the Western Pacific . To us and our allies ( Japan and South Korea ) , North Korea represents a far greater threat . China will not sacrifice such a key piece in the geopolitical chess game without some compensating gain .\nIt \u2019 s also a grave miscalculation to assume that we can make the Chinese serious about regime change in North Korea merely by the use of threats alone . We simply don \u2019 t have enough leverage through the use of economic sanctions . The Chinese will not sacrifice their long-term strategic advantage in Korea to avoid short-term economic pain from American sanctions , and such sanctions would hurt us as much as them .\nWe must therefore turn from the use of sticks to carrots , offering the Chinese strategic gains that are commensurate with their loss of North Korea as an irritant . What that would require is a Grand Bargain that ( 1 ) contains the DPRK threat , ( 2 ) keeps the South China Sea seal lanes open and ( 3 ) recognizes China \u2019 s legitimate interests in its sphere of influence .
