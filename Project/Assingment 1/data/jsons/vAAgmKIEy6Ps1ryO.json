They were posing in front of the Wessyngton Plantation house where they were born enslaved and continued to work as a cook and laundress into the late 1800s .\nMr. Baker says he was \u201c in shock \u201d when he realized that it was the very same photo as the one in the textbook with which he \u2019 d been obsessed . \u201c Although I had seen the photograph in the textbook many times , it assumed a different meaning once I knew that those people were my ancestors , \u201d he wrote in his book , \u201c The Washingtons of Wessyngton Plantation : Stories of My Family \u2019 s Journey to Freedom . \u201d\n\u201c I could hardly wait to get back to school and tell my classmates that my ancestors were in our history book . ...

The U.S. census in 1870 , the first to note the entire black population , is considered a genealogical \u201c brick wall \u201d before which slavery and Jim Crow laws erased the potential for paper trails used in genealogical research . Black Americans , excluded from mainstream institutional recognition , often were not registered at birth , death , and marriage or for the draft or voter rolls .\nThe dawn of the digital era allowing online searches of public documents and archival holdings , plus the availability of direct-to-consumer genetic testing , triggered a boom in black genealogical interest .\nOther more recent developments are credited with spiking interest , too : marketing around the 400th anniversary of the arrival of transatlantic slavery to the U.S. ; the 2018 film \u201c Black Panther , \u201d a fantasy of a peaceful , high-tech African kingdom that invigorated black identity ; and a burst of new and successful cultural institutions such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington , the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson , and the dramatic National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery , Alabama , honoring more than 4,400 lynching victims .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a direct correlation to the release of the movie \u2018 Black Panther \u2019 two years ago \u201d and a tripling of visits to AfricanAncestry.com , says Gina Paige , co-founder of the genetic testing company African Ancestry that traces lineage to a specific present-day African nation and ethnic group of origin through common maternal and paternal ancestors . She adds that the Trump administration \u2019 s \u201c intensified assault on black Americans \u201d is a contributing factor to the interest in ancestry , forcing \u201c black Americans to look at themselves through a new lens . \u201d\nMichael Bonfigli/Special to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Gina Paige ( facing camera ) , co-founder of a genetic testing company , helped Afra Brown reveal ancestry testing results at Ms. Brown 's family reunion in July .\nOverall , African Ancestry claims to have helped 500,000 African Americans reconnect with their roots since it started selling test kits in 2003 . It has compiled a genetic database of more than 30,000 indigenous African DNA samples to compare with that of clients \u2013 an amount that dwarfs other companies \u2019 African DNA files .\n\u201c Black Panther \u201d encapsulates the dichotomy between difficulties of life in the African diaspora and the fantasy of a black utopia on the continent . And , says Ms. Paige , it plays to the black longing for connections erased by slavery . African Americans implicitly understand a generalized heritage on the African continent . But they don \u2019 t have the specificity European Americans enjoy in claiming Irish or German or Italian descent , she says .\nAnd that \u2019 s important for some black Americans who feel the void , adds Ms. Paige , who admits that she , herself , had not had the \u201c personal curiosity \u201d to know more about her African roots as a child because it was impossible to trace . But with DNA testing as an option to know more , it did become possible and the void was more apparent as a result .\n\u201c In my opinion , [ black Americans ] are the original victims of identity theft , \u201d says Ms. Paige , \u201c because [ as a result of slavery ] we \u2019 ve lost everything that identifies us as a person ; we \u2019 ve lost our original names ; we \u2019 ve lost our languages ; we lost the freedom to honor our ancestors . And our families were torn apart . \u201d\nThe growing scale of the black ancestry search and its impact on the collective consciousness of the black community , she says , can restore and heal the residue of slave status by clarifying identity .\n\u201c Once you get that identity back \u2013 a sense of pride and place and belonging \u2013 that sense of being an individual , you then play a more confident and active role in your personal life , in your family life , your local and even your national and global community , \u201d says Ms. Paige . \u201c It gives you a better foundation to participate . \u201d\nClara Germani John F. Baker Jr. , a pioneer in tracing family roots , shows the ancestral tree he has been researching for four decades .\nFinding 11 generations of his family , beginning at age 13\nMr. Baker was a genealogy prodigy at age 13 . Soon after the discovery of that photo of his great-grandparents , Henny and Emanuel Washington , his parents were driving him all over greater Nashville to the state archives and library and to visit the white owners of Wessyngton Plantation .\nThe teen scoured such documents as slave bills of sale , plantation account books , slave tax entries , wills , deeds , and Washington family correspondence . His research was enriched by the unusually thorough record-keeping by the white Washingtons \u2013 relatives of the first U.S. president \u2013 who left Virginia to pioneer the Tennessee plantation in the late 1700s . Their account books detailed clothing and shoe sizes and costs of doctor visits for enslaved people who were ill ; letters between family members discussed visits to Virginia and Louisiana slave auctions .\nThe distillate of this very granular study of the economics and sociology of slavery is visible in Mr. Baker \u2019 s ability \u2013 not unlike doing long division in your head \u2013 to keep track of thousands of descendants and telling tidbits about them .\nOne of the most haunting threads he discovered was how his great-great-great-grandmother Jenny came to Wessyngton . Jenny \u2019 s extended family was owned in Virginia by Revolutionary War hero Col. Michael Blow . When he died , Jenny \u2019 s family was inherited by one of Blow \u2019 s sons , who then ran into financial difficulty . He sold 10-year-old Jenny and her 12-year-old sister in 1802 to the Washingtons . It is clear in the paperwork that the girls were force-marched from Virginia to Tennessee , but the emotional detail that Baker \u2013 and other black Americans piecing together their family history \u2013 narrates is the unspeakable trauma the girls suffered being torn from their mother and family , never to meet again .\nThis kind of graphic realization of ancestral events can , paradoxically , be inspiring . Dwight Fryer , a minister , FedEx marketing manager , and historical novelist , underscored this point when he spoke about his research at this summer \u2019 s Juneteenth event at Belle Meade Plantation in Nashville .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s a need for humankind to know their story , \u201d he says . Knowing the trials his enslaved great-great-grandmother Jane Dickens Hunt survived , he says , helped him deal with the pain of his own teenage daughter \u2019 s death in 2001 . \u201c I found things that made me understand just how strong I really am . \u201d\nMr. Fryer \u2019 s great-great-grandmother was forced to walk from North Carolina to Mississippi by slave owners . It spoke to him , he says , \u201c in an Elijah-type of way ... when God spoke to him in a quiet whisper \u2013 Jane Dickens Hunt was my quiet whisper . I began to really understand how special these people were , how smart they were to deal with these things , how strong ; and they lived and were enterprising . \u201d\nIn short : Mr. Fryer \u2019 s ancestors were models of survival to him .\nClara Germani `` I think there \u2019 s a need for humankind to know their story , '' says Dwight Fryer , a minister in Memphis , Tennessee , who writes historical novels about slavery .\nWhen 65 members of Afra Brown \u2019 s extended family gathered for their biannual reunion dinner in Silver Spring , Maryland , in July , a dramatic ancestry \u201c reveal \u201d was the featured event of the evening .\nThe conceit of the reveal is that genetic test results will suddenly clear the fog of identity for African Americans \u2013 they will know a nation or a specific tribe or an ethnic mix of their ancestors ( depending on the claims of which company \u2019 s test is involved ) . The drama lies in the ceremonial presentation and finally knowing rather than imagining a broad ancestral history .\nMen in Ms. Brown \u2019 s family had taken a patrilineal test , which analyzes just the Y chromosome passed from father to male offspring . The other two types of genetic testing are matrilineal , which tests the DNA passed unchanged exclusively from mother to offspring , and autosomal , or admixture , which tests all the rest of the DNA and gives the long-term ancestry in a person \u2019 s entire genetic family tree , including a sense of ethnic percentages and even geographic location of ancestors .\nMs. Paige of African Ancestry came to present the results at the family reunion . Even though Ms. Brown , a Washington nurse , already knew the details and had bought party favors in the colors of the flag of the African nation \u2013 and tribe \u2013 of their roots , she was still nervous about how the surprise would go over , particularly with the family matriarchs , her 82-year-old mother and 78-year-old aunt .\nMichael Bonfigli/Special to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Afra Brown introduces herself at the Reddick family reunion in Silver Spring , Maryland , where DNA results identifying the family \u2019 s ancestry were announced .\nWhen Ms. Paige announced that the women \u2019 s patrilineal roots traced several hundred years back to the Bamileke tribe of what is now Cameroon , there was joyous surprise \u2013 though one cousin , who had been resistant to the testing , stalked out , says Ms. Brown . Much of the surprise was that Nigerian or Native American roots were not part of the family \u2019 s lineage as members had expected , says Ms. Brown .\nSocial media is full of emotional genetic testing reveals . One typical happy video , for example , features an earnest young black American couple , John and Sophia . They live in Ghana and are recording themselves sitting in their car \u2013 baby in the backseat \u2013 giddy to play a video reveal of their matrilineal test results sent by Ms. Paige . Sophia \u2019 s roots trace to the Tikar people of Cameroon . ( \u201c I feel like I \u2019 m flying , \u201d she gasps . ) John \u2019 s line traces to Sierra Leone \u2019 s Mende tribe , who were historically rice farmers . ( \u201c We love rice ! \u201d Sophia emotes . )\nBut another reveal on YouTube is less breathless . In this 11-minute segment , 20-something Leroy stalls during the reveal , agonizing for long minutes , \u201c nervous \u201d and \u201c scared , \u201d because he saved up to take both patrilineal and matrilineal tests ( about $ 600 , total , from African Ancestry ) . He \u2019 s worried he \u2019 ll have white , European roots . When he opens the envelopes , he is crestfallen to learn he has Iberian roots on his father \u2019 s side and to find that his matrilineal roots are in the Akan tribe of Ghana , which he considers too \u201c common \u201d and not \u201c exotic \u201d in the world of African genealogical testing . He ends the video by saying he is \u201c not a happy camper . \u201d\nHarvard \u2019 s Dr. Gates , who pioneered the reveal in the early 2000s with his public television miniseries \u201c African American Lives , \u201d counsels caution about staking any happiness on genealogical findings . \u201c DNA analysis is not for the fainthearted , \u201d he says . It can \u201c present some profound challenges \u201d about what happened \u201c in the dark reaches of slavery , \u201d not to mention uncovering recent family secrets surrounding paternity .\nBrynn Anderson/AP A sculpture by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo is part of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice . Opened in Montgomery , Alabama , in April 2018 , the complex focuses on honoring those killed in America 's racist lynchings .\nThe way this plays out for Leroy in the video can be purely a personal disappointment , but on a collective level in the black community , Dr. Gates explains , it is \u201c new concrete scientific evidence for the agonizing costs of slavery on black women and the black family . \u201d\nHe cites research showing that the average African American is 24 % white ; Dr. Gates , himself , is 50 % white . \u201c All this stuff on reparations is just sophisticated scholarship by economists and historians , \u201d he observes , \u201c but ... this high degree of European ancestry for an average African American most likely did not occur because of \u2018 Guess Who \u2019 s Coming to Dinner ? \u2019 This is rape . What else are you going to call it ? \u201d\nAncestry searches can provide evidence for reparations , but also for reconciliation . Business , trade , educational , and aid groups see the search for roots as a natural platform for turning the sins of transatlantic slavery into productive contemporary reconnection to Africa . Likewise , initiatives surrounding the 400th anniversary of the beginning of slavery ( which is dated to the 1619 arrival of settlers with slaves to Jamestown , Virginia ) have created a dramatic historical atmosphere for roots searches and reveals \u2013 but also for renewed ties between the continent and the diaspora .\nGhana has pioneered the promotional lead in reconnecting those who were forced to leave the continent . As far back as 2000 , the West African nation offered citizenship to people of Ghanaian ancestry and a \u201c right of abode \u201d immigration status for anyone of African descent in the diaspora . Ghana , as well as Liberia , Tanzania , Rwanda , Kenya , Mauritius , and the African Union as a whole , has been involved with the R400 Summit planned for Charlotte , North Carolina , in September to \u201c reconnect , reconcile , reclaim and reimagine what was lost over the past 400 years. \u201d The summit will host a 75-person reveal of ancestry .\nGhana also has capitalized on its historic status as a major port of departure for slave ships through tourism . African Americans frequently take trips to the dungeons of forts where enslaved people were held before ships embarked to the Americas . For example , a group of three dozen NAACP leaders and members , including its president , Derrick Johnson , traveled to Jamestown and on to Ghana to reverse the journey of their ancestors and do reveals in August .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff/File A guide closes tourists in the `` death cell , '' where enslaved people sentenced to die were once held , as they visit Elmina Castle in Elmina , Ghana . The building held slaves for hundreds of years and is today a museum .\nOne twist on the search trend is a reconciliation effort by Saint Louis University and the Jesuits USA Central and Southern Province . They are trying to trace the genealogical descent of slaves owned , rented , and borrowed by the Jesuit priests who came to run the school in 1823 . As part of their effort , the university sent letters in July to some slave descendants whom researchers believe they \u2019 ve discovered through DNA databases and church archival records .\n\u201c History is very important to ancestry , but what \u2019 s also important is what \u2019 s happening [ in Africa ] now \u201d and in the future , says Diallo Shabazz , co-founder of Birthright Africa , a New York nonprofit that has committed to sending 5,000 people of African descent \u2013 ages 13 to 30 \u2013 to Africa and places within the U.S. to explore their cultural roots and leadership and entrepreneurial aspirations . The next phase of ancestry searching , he suggests , should \u201c really be a transition in the way people relate to their ancestry on the continent . \u201d\nKarmen Thomas holds one fervent vision of the transatlantic future : After receiving matrilineal tests linking her to the Mende people of Sierra Leone last year , the Charlotte , North Carolina , operations manager connected with 500 other Mende descendants \u2013 and Mende people in Sierra Leone \u2013 on Facebook . She speaks for \u201c hours every other day \u201d with her very distant relatives in Africa and is planning a trip there in November to bring assistance for community improvement projects .\n\u201c I have never met these people and I can tell you I love them like they are family I \u2019 ve known all of my life , \u201d she says , noting that they represent the culture black Americans lost when their ancestors were kidnapped and brought here . As a result , she describes a well of longing to reconnect that , if collectively harnessed , might have a major impact in Africa . \u201c I want to go there twice a year . I want to invest in property . I want dual citizenship . I want to bank there , put money in there and bring revenue there . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

And, says Ms. Paige, it plays to the black longing for connections erased by slavery. African Americans implicitly understand a generalized heritage on the African continent. But they don\u2019t have the specificity European Americans enjoy in claiming Irish or German or Italian descent, she says.\n\nAnd that\u2019s important for some black Americans who feel the void, adds Ms. Paige, who admits that she, herself, had not had the \u201cpersonal curiosity\u201d to know more about her African roots as a child because it was impossible to trace. But with DNA testing as an option to know more, it did become possible and the void was more apparent as a result.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, [black Americans] are the original victims of identity theft,\u201d says Ms. Paige, \u201cbecause [as a result of slavery] we\u2019ve lost everything that identifies us as a person; we\u2019ve lost our original names; we\u2019ve lost our languages; we lost the freedom to honor our ancestors. And our families were torn apart.\u201d\n\nThe growing scale of the black ancestry search and its impact on the collective consciousness of the black community, she says, can restore and heal the residue of slave status by clarifying identity.\n\n\u201cOnce you get that identity back \u2013 a sense of pride and place and belonging \u2013 that sense of being an individual, you then play a more confident and active role in your personal life, in your family life, your local and even your national and global community,\u201d says Ms. Paige. \u201cIt gives you a better foundation to participate.\u201d\n\nClara Germani John F. Baker Jr., a pioneer in tracing family roots, shows the ancestral tree he has been researching for four decades.\n\nFinding 11 generations of his family, beginning at age 13\n\nMr. Baker was a genealogy prodigy at age 13. Soon after the discovery of that photo of his great-grandparents, Henny and Emanuel Washington, his parents were driving him all over greater Nashville to the state archives and library and to visit the white owners of Wessyngton Plantation.\n\nThe teen scoured such documents as slave bills of sale, plantation account books, slave tax entries, wills, deeds, and Washington family correspondence. His research was enriched by the unusually thorough record-keeping by the white Washingtons \u2013 relatives of the first U.S. president \u2013 who left Virginia to pioneer the Tennessee plantation in the late 1700s. Their account books detailed clothing and shoe sizes and costs of doctor visits for enslaved people who were ill; letters between family members discussed visits to Virginia and Louisiana slave auctions.\n\nThe distillate of this very granular study of the economics and sociology of slavery is visible in Mr. Baker\u2019s ability \u2013 not unlike doing long division in your head \u2013 to keep track of thousands of descendants and telling tidbits about them.\n\nOne of the most haunting threads he discovered was how his great-great-great-grandmother Jenny came to Wessyngton. Jenny\u2019s extended family was owned in Virginia by Revolutionary War hero Col. Michael Blow. When he died, Jenny\u2019s family was inherited by one of Blow\u2019s sons, who then ran into financial difficulty. He sold 10-year-old Jenny and her 12-year-old sister in 1802 to the Washingtons. It is clear in the paperwork that the girls were force-marched from Virginia to Tennessee, but the emotional detail that Baker \u2013 and other black Americans piecing together their family history \u2013 narrates is the unspeakable trauma the girls suffered being torn from their mother and family, never to meet again.\n\nThis kind of graphic realization of ancestral events can, paradoxically, be inspiring. Dwight Fryer, a minister, FedEx marketing manager, and historical novelist, underscored this point when he spoke about his research at this summer\u2019s Juneteenth event at Belle Meade Plantation in Nashville.\n\nPain \u2013 and survival\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a need for humankind to know their story,\u201d he says. Knowing the trials his enslaved great-great-grandmother Jane Dickens Hunt survived, he says, helped him deal with the pain of his own teenage daughter\u2019s death in 2001. \u201cI found things that made me understand just how strong I really am.\u201d\n\nMr. Fryer\u2019s great-great-grandmother was forced to walk from North Carolina to Mississippi by slave owners. It spoke to him, he says, \u201cin an Elijah-type of way ... when God spoke to him in a quiet whisper \u2013 Jane Dickens Hunt was my quiet whisper. I began to really understand how special these people were, how smart they were to deal with these things, how strong; and they lived and were enterprising.\u201d\n\nIn short: Mr. Fryer\u2019s ancestors were models of survival to him.\n\nClara Germani \"I think there\u2019s a need for humankind to know their story,\" says Dwight Fryer, a minister in Memphis, Tennessee, who writes historical novels about slavery.\n\nThe ancestry \u201creveal\u201d\n\nWhen 65 members of Afra Brown\u2019s extended family gathered for their biannual reunion dinner in Silver Spring, Maryland, in July, a dramatic ancestry \u201creveal\u201d was the featured event of the evening.\n\nThe conceit of the reveal is that genetic test results will suddenly clear the fog of identity for African Americans \u2013 they will know a nation or a specific tribe or an ethnic mix of their ancestors (depending on the claims of which company\u2019s test is involved). The drama lies in the ceremonial presentation and finally knowing rather than imagining a broad ancestral history.\n\nMen in Ms. Brown\u2019s family had taken a patrilineal test, which analyzes just the Y chromosome passed from father to male offspring. The other two types of genetic testing are matrilineal, which tests the DNA passed unchanged exclusively from mother to offspring, and autosomal, or admixture, which tests all the rest of the DNA and gives the long-term ancestry in a person\u2019s entire genetic family tree, including a sense of ethnic percentages and even geographic location of ancestors.\n\nMs. Paige of African Ancestry came to present the results at the family reunion. Even though Ms. Brown, a Washington nurse, already knew the details and had bought party favors in the colors of the flag of the African nation \u2013 and tribe \u2013 of their roots, she was still nervous about how the surprise would go over, particularly with the family matriarchs, her 82-year-old mother and 78-year-old aunt.\n\nMichael Bonfigli/Special to The Christian Science Monitor Afra Brown introduces herself at the Reddick family reunion in Silver Spring, Maryland, where DNA results identifying the family\u2019s ancestry were announced.\n\nWhen Ms. Paige announced that the women\u2019s patrilineal roots traced several hundred years back to the Bamileke tribe of what is now Cameroon, there was joyous surprise \u2013 though one cousin, who had been resistant to the testing, stalked out, says Ms. Brown. Much of the surprise was that Nigerian or Native American roots were not part of the family\u2019s lineage as members had expected, says Ms. Brown.\n\nSocial media is full of emotional genetic testing reveals. One typical happy video, for example, features an earnest young black American couple, John and Sophia. They live in Ghana and are recording themselves sitting in their car \u2013 baby in the backseat \u2013 giddy to play a video reveal of their matrilineal test results sent by Ms. Paige. Sophia\u2019s roots trace to the Tikar people of Cameroon. (\u201cI feel like I\u2019m flying,\u201d she gasps.) John\u2019s line traces to Sierra Leone\u2019s Mende tribe, who were historically rice farmers. (\u201cWe love rice!\u201d Sophia emotes.)\n\n\u201cNot for the fainthearted\u201d\n\nBut another reveal on YouTube is less breathless. In this 11-minute segment, 20-something Leroy stalls during the reveal, agonizing for long minutes, \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cscared,\u201d because he saved up to take both patrilineal and matrilineal tests (about $600, total, from African Ancestry). He\u2019s worried he\u2019ll have white, European roots. When he opens the envelopes, he is crestfallen to learn he has Iberian roots on his father\u2019s side and to find that his matrilineal roots are in the Akan tribe of Ghana, which he considers too \u201ccommon\u201d and not \u201cexotic\u201d in the world of African genealogical testing. He ends the video by saying he is \u201cnot a happy camper.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s Dr. Gates, who pioneered the reveal in the early 2000s with his public television miniseries \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d counsels caution about staking any happiness on genealogical findings. \u201cDNA analysis is not for the fainthearted,\u201d he says. It can \u201cpresent some profound challenges\u201d about what happened \u201cin the dark reaches of slavery,\u201d not to mention uncovering recent family secrets surrounding paternity.\n\nBrynn Anderson/AP A sculpture by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo is part of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. Opened in Montgomery, Alabama, in April 2018, the complex focuses on honoring those killed in America's racist lynchings.\n\nThe way this plays out for Leroy in the video can be purely a personal disappointment, but on a collective level in the black community, Dr. Gates explains, it is \u201cnew concrete scientific evidence for the agonizing costs of slavery on black women and the black family.\u201d\n\nHe cites research showing that the average African American is 24% white; Dr. Gates, himself, is 50% white. \u201cAll this stuff on reparations is just sophisticated scholarship by economists and historians,\u201d he observes, \u201cbut ... this high degree of European ancestry for an average African American most likely did not occur because of \u2018Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner?\u2019 This is rape. What else are you going to call it?\u201d\n\nReconnecting with Africa\n\nAncestry searches can provide evidence for reparations, but also for reconciliation. Business, trade, educational, and aid groups see the search for roots as a natural platform for turning the sins of transatlantic slavery into productive contemporary reconnection to Africa. Likewise, initiatives surrounding the 400th anniversary of the beginning of slavery (which is dated to the 1619 arrival of settlers with slaves to Jamestown, Virginia) have created a dramatic historical atmosphere for roots searches and reveals \u2013 but also for renewed ties between the continent and the diaspora.\n\nGhana has pioneered the promotional lead in reconnecting those who were forced to leave the continent. As far back as 2000, the West African nation offered citizenship to people of Ghanaian ancestry and a \u201cright of abode\u201d immigration status for anyone of African descent in the diaspora. Ghana, as well as Liberia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Mauritius, and the African Union as a whole, has been involved with the R400 Summit planned for Charlotte, North Carolina, in September to \u201creconnect, reconcile, reclaim and reimagine what was lost over the past 400 years.\u201d The summit will host a 75-person reveal of ancestry.\n\nGhana also has capitalized on its historic status as a major port of departure for slave ships through tourism. African Americans frequently take trips to the dungeons of forts where enslaved people were held before ships embarked to the Americas. For example, a group of three dozen NAACP leaders and members, including its president, Derrick Johnson, traveled to Jamestown and on to Ghana to reverse the journey of their ancestors and do reveals in August.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff/File A guide closes tourists in the \"death cell,\" where enslaved people sentenced to die were once held, as they visit Elmina Castle in Elmina, Ghana. The building held slaves for hundreds of years and is today a museum.\n\nOne twist on the search trend is a reconciliation effort by Saint Louis University and the Jesuits USA Central and Southern Province. They are trying to trace the genealogical descent of slaves owned, rented, and borrowed by the Jesuit priests who came to run the school in 1823. As part of their effort, the university sent letters in July to some slave descendants whom researchers believe they\u2019ve discovered through DNA databases and church archival records.\n\n\u201cHistory is very important to ancestry, but what\u2019s also important is what\u2019s happening [in Africa] now\u201d and in the future, says Diallo Shabazz, co-founder of Birthright Africa, a New York nonprofit that has committed to sending 5,000 people of African descent \u2013 ages 13 to 30 \u2013 to Africa and places within the U.S. to explore their cultural roots and leadership and entrepreneurial aspirations. The next phase of ancestry searching, he suggests, should \u201creally be a transition in the way people relate to their ancestry on the continent.\u201d\n\nCultivating relationships to past and present\n\nKarmen Thomas holds one fervent vision of the transatlantic future: After receiving matrilineal tests linking her to the Mende people of Sierra Leone last year, the Charlotte, North Carolina, operations manager connected with 500 other Mende descendants \u2013 and Mende people in Sierra Leone \u2013 on Facebook. She speaks for \u201chours every other day\u201d with her very distant relatives in Africa and is planning a trip there in November to bring assistance for community improvement projects.\n\n\u201cI have never met these people and I can tell you I love them like they are family I\u2019ve known all of my life,\u201d she says, noting that they represent the culture black Americans lost when their ancestors were kidnapped and brought here. As a result, she describes a well of longing to reconnect that, if collectively harnessed, might have a major impact in Africa. \u201cI want to go there twice a year. I want to invest in property. I want dual citizenship. I want to bank there, put money in there and bring revenue there.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
