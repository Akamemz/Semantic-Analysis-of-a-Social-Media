He also recently called a political opponent \u2014 a state representative \u2014 and left an expletive-laden , furious voicemail , and later said he would like to shoot and kill that same state representative in a duel .\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald , a TV reporter suggested that State Rep. Drew Gattine , a Democrat , had called LePage , a Republican , a racist , and asked LePage how he felt about it . Upon hearing about it , LePage left Gattine a voicemail with expletives and homophobic insults :\nMr. Gattine , this is Gov . Paul Richard LePage . I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist , you cocksucker . I want to talk to you . I want you to prove that I \u2019 m a racist . I \u2019 ve spent my life helping black people and you little son of a bitch , socialist cocksucker . You\u2026 I need you to\u2026 Just friggin \u2019 . I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you . Thank you .\nLePage later expanded on his rage to the Portland Press Herald , saying , \u201c When a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist , now I \u2019 d like him to come up here because , tell you right now , I wish it were 1825 . And we would have a duel . That \u2019 s how angry I am . And I would not put my gun in the air , I guarantee you ; I would not be [ Alexander ] Hamilton . I would point it right between his eyes , because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he \u2019 s been in this legislature to help move the state forward . \u201d\nGattine , who has opposed some of the governor \u2019 s welfare reform and \u201c tough-on-crime \u201d efforts in the face of the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic , denied calling LePage a racist . He also said he was surprised at the voicemail .\n\u201c Obviously that message is upsetting , inappropriate , and uncalled for , \u201d Gattine said . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to believe it \u2019 s from the governor of the state of Maine , but again , we need to stay focused on the drug problem we are facing here in Maine and can not allow this story to be about the governor \u2019 s inappropriate and vulgar behaviors . \u201d\nIf Gattine had called LePage racist , he wouldn \u2019 t be the first to do so . LePage came under fire earlier this year after making racist remarks at a town hall . LePage said :\nThese are guys with the name D-Money , Smoothie , Shifty . These types of guys , they come from Connecticut and New York . They come up here , they sell their heroin , then they go back home .

This racial trope in the war on drugs goes back to at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries , when local , state , and federal lawmakers pushed drug laws by suggesting that minority people would lure and harm young white women with drugs .\nGattine reportedly referenced these comments to the TV reporter , calling them racially charged and unhelpful to the cause of solving the state \u2019 s opioid crisis .
