National Democrats see Festersen as just the kind of pro-business moderate who can give the party a shot in the Republican-friendly 2nd Congressional District .\nThe same thing happened in New Jersey , where attorney Bill Hughes Jr. , the son of a popular former congressman , for months resisted pleas by national Democrats to run against longtime GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo . But after watching the budget drama unfold , Hughes says he \u2019 s likely to run .\nSo does Indiana Democrat Joe Bock , a University of Notre Dame official who recently said , after much hesitation , that he will most likely run .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been looking at this , and I \u2019 ve come to the conclusion that if I didn \u2019 t do it , it \u2019 s because I \u2019 m lazy or a chicken , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSome of the Democratic recruits have statewide or national profiles .
