Three years after saving President Barack Obama \u2019 s signature legislative achievement from a potentially devastating blow , Roberts led the court to a 6-3 ruling Thursday rejecting a new legal challenge that could have upended Obamacare by denying insurance subsidies to Americans in 34 states .\nGay rights advocates also scored a landmark victory Friday as the court effectively made same-sex marriage rights the law of the land , holding in a far-reaching , 5-4 decision that the Constitution prohibits states from denying marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples .\nAnd in an opinion that would have drawn far more attention in a less action-packed year , the court ruled Thursday , 5-4 , that proof of intentional bias is not required in housing discrimination cases .
