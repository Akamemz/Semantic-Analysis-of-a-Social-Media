''\nAnd if Americans are looking for a commander-in-chief , the South Carolina senator believes he 's it .\nGraham , who told CNN last month he 's been `` more right than wrong on foreign policy , '' announced his presidential bid in his hometown of Central , South Carolina , on Monday . He hopes that his track record on foreign affairs will give him the advantage in a wide-open primary fight .\n`` I want to be President to defeat the enemies trying to kill us , not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them , but defeat them , '' he said at his kickoff event .\nThe timing could not be better for Graham , a national security hawk announcing his candidacy on the day a key provision of the Patriot Act expired in large part because of Sen. Rand Paul , another Republican running for president . He becomes the 9th Republican to enter the field .\nPaul and Graham are foils in their party and represent an internal struggle for the soul of the GOP .\nBut Graham still barely registers in the polls .

Of all the nearly two dozen Republicans running or contemplating a run , most are governors with relatively little experience in foreign affairs or young senators with a much shorter track record .\nAnd Graham 's hoping that expertise , peppered with jokes delivered in an easy Southern drawl , will be enough to help him overcome conservative skeptics wary of his willingness to work with Democrats and his moderate position on immigration reform .\nA close friend of John McCain -- who often jokes that Graham is his `` illegitimate son '' -- the South Carolinian is no stranger to presidential politics , having campaigned for the Arizona Republican during both of his presidential runs . He 's likely to have the favor returned ; three of Graham 's top campaign staffers are veterans of McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign , and he 's been talking up Graham 's prospects for months .\nBut for all of McCain 's chatter , Graham has yet to break out in the pack .\nHis advisers acknowledge their first and most urgent task is to introduce the candidate to voters .\nJUST WATCHED Graham campaign takes shots at Paul 's foreign policy Replay More Videos ...
