    "content": "In the mid-2000s , Hudson City Savings Bank , a large savings bank in New Jersey , was doing well , earning accolades for its smart management , its \u201c small town \u201d feel , and its relative strength in the face of the brewing financial crisis . It was even expanding\u2014opening more than 50 new branches in neighboring New York and Connecticut .\nBut Hudson \u2019 s expansion strategy seemed designed to exclude certain customers . Despite placing dozens of new branches in counties near New York City , such as Westchester , the bank didn \u2019 t open any at all in Queens , Kings , Bronx , and New York counties\u2014which happen to be the counties with the highest proportion of majority black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the state .\nIn 2014 , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) started investigating the bank for possible redlining\u2014the practice of excluding minority communities from credit products . To build a case , the bureau \u2019 s investigators relied on information collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ) , which requires lenders to report various data points on the mortgages they sell\u2014including the distribution of loans across census tracts , data that helps regulators spot patterns of racial discrimination .\nMapping Hudson \u2019 s HMDA data revealed that the bank \u2019 s expansion \u201c excludes and forms a semi-circle around \u201d those heavily minority counties , the CFPB and the Justice Department noted in a subsequent lawsuit . Hudson , the suit alleged , \u201c discouraged consumers in majority-Black-and-Hispanic census tracts from applying for credit . \u201d\nA major anti-redlining lawsuit hinged on data rules the Trump administration is doing its best to undermine .\nThe data showed that plenty of people in those black and Hispanic neighborhoods were getting loans , just not from Hudson . In 2014 , the bank had approved 1,886 mortgages in New Jersey , New York , and Connecticut , but only 25 went to black borrowers . When a customer from one of the four excluded New York counties showed up at a Hudson branch , they would be deemed ineligible for certain discounted products the bank offered its low- or moderate-income clients from other areas . What \u2019 s more , Hudson \u2019 s advertisements dictated that customers had to go in to a single branch location\u2014in majority white Fairfield , Connecticut , an hour \u2019 s drive from New York City\u2014in order to close on any of the discounted loans .\n\u201c Hudson City , \u201d the agencies concluded , \u201c had no legitimate , non-discriminatory reason to draw relatively few applications from these majority Black-and-Hispanic areas. \u201d In 2015 , Hudson settled the federal lawsuit for nearly $ 33 million , the largest redlining settlement in the history of the CFPB and the DOJ . ( The settlement did not include an admission of guilt by Hudson . ) The deal called for the majority of the settlement to be invested in a mortgage subsidy program for the neighborhoods Hudson had neglected .\nThe access of federal regulators to good HMDA data has been key to many redemptive actions , like the Hudson lawsuit , that have helped consumers . But the Trump administration recently made a move that threatens the integrity of the data . In December , the CFPB\u2014whose new interim director is Mick Mulvaney , Trump \u2019 s budget director\u2014announced that the agency will no longer fine lenders for reporting errors . This will make the information , \u201c much less useful , \u201d says Makada Henry-Nickie , a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution and former senior analyst at the CFPB . \u201c Every single mortgage discrimination or redlining case is supported by the HMDA data , even if it didn \u2019 t originate there , \u201d she adds . \u201c So with Mulvaney \u2019 s decision , we \u2019 re losing a lot . \u201d\nThe agency has also announced plans to reconsider the data-reporting requirements altogether .\nThese recent changes are just one piece of a broader trend that has swept across government since Trump took office\u2014a gutting of anti-discrimination measures across the financial services , including mortgages , car loans , payday loans , and more . \u201c This is a pattern we have observed , and it \u2019 s fairly alarming , \u201d says Yana Miles , senior legislative counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending . \u201c You have good policy that protects consumers and tries to address discrimination . We \u2019 re seeing these rules delayed , picked at , or invalidated . \u201d\nCongress recently repealed a ban on corporate contract language that leaves consumers powerless in the case of a dispute .\nThis trend ramped up last October , when Congress repealed the CFPB \u2019 s rule banning clauses in financial contracts that required arbitration and prevented class-action lawsuits . Class actions allow customers to pool their resources to sue as a group , which tends to be much more feasible than financing a lawsuit individually\u2014especially in cases where the financial losses are not large . With mandatory arbitration , too , the deck is stacked heavily against the consumer . The repeal marked a major win for Wall Street , easing the way for banks to engage in harmful practices\u2014including unequal treatment of minority borrowers\u2014unchecked by consumer lawsuits .\nLast month , Trump \u2019 s Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it would delay enforcement of an Obama-era rule that forces local governments to identify racial segregation in housing and develop plans to address it . Under the original rule , communities had to submit their plans to HUD starting in January 2019 to remain eligible for federal housing aid . But the administration has extended the deadline to October 31 , 2020\u2014days before the next presidential election . Some observers think the delay may presage an undoing of the rule , which Housing Secretary Ben Carson has long criticized as akin to \u201c social engineering. \u201d ( Since taking his Cabinet post , Carson has said he \u2019 d like to \u201c reinterpret \u201d the rule . ) HUD justified the delay by saying some of the assessments already submitted were deemed ineffective at reversing housing segregation , a sign that communities needed more time to hone their plans .\nTwo weeks after the HUD announcement , Mulvaney \u2019 s CFPB said it would reconsider another Obama-era rule\u2014one that created landmark federal restrictions on payday lenders . Using a person \u2019 s coming paycheck as collateral , these lenders loan cash at astronomical rates\u2014sometimes , allegedly , as high as 950 percent . Studies have found that the lenders disproportionately target communities of color when setting up their locations .\nWith Mulvaney in charge , the CFPB has stopped going after auto dealers who give their black customers higher interest rates .\nThe CFPB has also announced it would strip enforcement powers from the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity , the agency \u2019 s division responsible for protecting minority borrowers against discriminatory lending . The fair lending office has levied hundreds of millions of dollars in fines on lenders who overcharged nonwhite borrowers , and has been responsible for some of the agency \u2019 s biggest victories , including a $ 169 million fine against GE Capital for credit card discrimination\u2014the largest such settlement in the federal government \u2019 s history\u2014and the 2015 Hudson settlement .\nConsumer watchdogs are further concerned that under Mulvaney \u2019 s control , the CFPB , through a series of confusing legislative twists and turns , appears to have rolled back its guidance cracking down on discriminatory pricing on auto loans . In 2013 , the agency called out car dealers for jacking up interest rates on nonwhite customers and then imposed limits on the dealers \u2019 discretion to mark up those rates at random .\nThe auto-lending rule quickly became a Republican target\u2014in 2015 , Mulvaney , then a congressman , voted for a bill that aimed to nullify it .

The office determined that the CFPB had flouted certain congressional regulations in the process , and concluded that the agency needed to resubmit the rule for congressional approval before enforcing it any further .
