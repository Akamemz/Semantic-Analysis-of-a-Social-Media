    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight .\nRoberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race .\nAppeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by Roberts .\nAppointed to the bench by President George W. Bush , Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . He dissented in United States v. Windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples . And he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans .\nYet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice , and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again .\n`` If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court , '' said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage . `` Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? ''\nFor some conservatives , a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter , who was nominated to the bench by George H.W . Bush and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy , a Ronald Reagan appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority .\nThe hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts .\n`` The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution , '' said Edward Whelan , president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center . `` Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice . ''\nThose hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case .\nIn his majority opinion , Kennedy said the `` principal purpose '' of the Defense of Marriage Act was to `` impose inequality . ''\nRoberts disagreed . He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide `` uniformity and stability '' at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman .\nRoberts picked up on Kennedy 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday `` come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions .
