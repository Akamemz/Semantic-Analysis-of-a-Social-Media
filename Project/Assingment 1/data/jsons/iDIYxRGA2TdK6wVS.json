''\nBirx said that while the U.S. has completed over 300,000 tests , `` We have more to do . ''\n`` Is everything cool with you and Dr . Fauci ? '' Trump was asked . Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert and a key member of the coronavirus task force , has candidly contradicted the president on certain overstatements in recent days , including the president 's optimism over drugs for coronavirus treatment despite no drugs currently being approved to treat it .\n`` He has other things to do . We get along very well ... we 're fine , we 're fine , '' Trump said , complimenting the team of doctors on the coronavirus task force as `` extraordinary . ''\n`` If we delay this out , you are going to lose more people than you are losing with the situation as we know it , '' Trump said . `` I think it 's very important for our country to go back . I 've had many , many people -- when he said 'it 's a little bit controversial ' -- not to most people . Most people said I 'm right about it . ''\nHours after New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat , blasted the federal response , but not Trump by name -- saying FEMA sending 400 ventilators did n't cut it when New York needed tens of thousands -- Trump signaled the lack of ventilators was actually Cuomo 's fault .\nPrepared to respond to Cuomo 's harsh criticism , Trump was handed a piece of paper from someone off camera and read it off :\n`` This says New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying 16,000 ventilators in 2015 , '' Trump said . `` So he had a chance to buy in 2015 , 16,000 ventilators at a very low price , and he turned it down . I 'm not blaming him or anything else . But he should n't be talking about us . He 's supposed to be buying his own ventilators . ''\nLater on , Trump said that the federal government 's relationship with governors is a `` two-way street , '' adding , `` Then I hear that there 's a problem with ventilators . Well we sent them ventilators . And they could have had 15 or 16,000 two years ago and all they had to do was order them . They ca n't blame us for that . ''\nAsked by Fox News \u2019 Bill Hemmer in a one-on-one interview taped after an earlier town hall why he chose Easter as the date by which he wanted the country \u201c opened up , \u201d Trump said one reason is because it would be \u201c beautiful \u201d to have the churches full .\n\u201c Easter \u2019 s a very special day for me . And I see it \u2019 s sort of in that timeline that I \u2019 m thinking about . And I say , wouldn \u2019 t it be great to have all of the churches full ? \u201d Trump said . \u201c I think Easter Sunday -- and you \u2019 ll have packed churches all over our country -- I think it would be a beautiful time . \u201d\n\u201c And it \u2019 s just about the timeline that I think is right , \u201d the president continued . \u201c It gives us more of a chance to work on what we \u2019 re doing . And I \u2019 m not sure that \u2019 s going to be the day , but I would like to aim it right at Easter Sunday . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump is followed by Vice President Mike Pence as he arrives for the coronavirus response daily briefing at the White House , March 23 , 2020 . Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\nMoments ahead of Trump \u2019 s town hall , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , in a fiery daily news conference on COVID-19 , blasted the federal government \u2019 s response to the outbreak , saying that it holds the power to produce life-saving ventilators and other equipment but is n't invoking it -- at the cost of human lives .\n`` FEMA says , 'we 're sending 400 ventilators . ' Really ? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000 ? '' Cuomo said . `` You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators . ''\n`` The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government , period , '' Cuomo continued , criticizing the Trump administration \u2019 s delay in using the powers of the Defense Production Act . `` I need the ventilators in 14 days . Only the federal government has that power . And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me . ''\n`` The president said 'it 's a war , it 's a war . ' Then act like it 's a war , '' Cuomo added .\nVice President Mike Pence , appearing on a Fox News 'virtual town hall '' from the White House Rose Garden after Cuomo 's complaints , said , `` I know we started our conversation this hour on the subject ventilators and the challenges the state of New York faces . I was so pleased to confirm that earlier today that FEMA , from the national stockpile , shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York -- and tomorrow there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile . ''\nPresident Trump doubled down on comments made Monday that Americans `` can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself '' referencing economic fallout amid social distancing guidelines designed to minimize fatalities due to COVID-19 .\n`` Our people want to return to work , '' the president tweeted Tuesday morning . `` They will practice Social Distancing and all else , and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly . We can do two things together . THE CURE CAN NOT BE WORSE ( by far ) THAN THE PROBLEM ! Congress MUST ACT NOW . We will come back strong ! ''\nAt Monday night 's briefing , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked the president if he 's worried about the virus spreading unabated if the restrictions are lifted .\n`` We have two very , very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration , '' Trump said . `` Life is fragile and economies are fragile . ''\n`` If it were up to the doctors , they may say , 'Let 's keep it shut down . Let 's shut down the entire world because again you 're up to 150 countries , ' '' Trump said , when asked whether any doctors on the task force agreed with his suggestion that social distancing guidelines will pay off in weeks not months .\n`` So , let 's shut down the entire world and when we shut it down , that 'd be wonderful , and let 's keep it shut for a couple of years . We ca n't do that , '' Trump said .\nThe president also predicted `` there will be tremendous death '' from shutting down the economy and job losses , `` probably '' more than the disease would cause .\nHe 's expected to expand on the topic in a town hall with Fox News Monday afternoon -- in an event appearing to replace , for now at least , the daily coronavirus task force briefing .\nState of the stimulus package : Negotiations continue , leaders signal Tuesday night vote\nAfter Senate Democrats successfully blocked the GOP-backed `` phase three '' $ 2 trillion coronavirus relief measure in its current form twice in 24 hours , negotiations between Senate leadership and the White House continue behind closed doors ,\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , left , accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows , walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington , D.C. , March 24 , 2020 . Patrick Semansky/AP\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed hope that the Senate would successfully vote to move forward on the stimulus bill from the floor Tuesday morning and again slammed his Democratic colleagues for the unforeseen delays .\n`` The clock has run out , the buzzer is sounded , the hour for bargaining as though this were business as usual has expired , '' McConnell said .\nA little after midnight , Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin and director of White House Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland emerged from their final meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his top staff .\nAll parties said there were a few remaining issues to lock down but that they were nearly done -- and expect a deal .\n`` There 's still a few little differences , '' Schumer said . `` Neither of us think they \u2019 re in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement . ''\nThe Democratic leader said the Senate would `` hopefully vote on it '' Tuesday evening .\nTrump said in Monday 's night briefing that Republicans and Democrats `` have no choice '' but to reach a deal .\n`` I got a call a little while ago . I guess they 're getting closer . Should go quickly and must go quickly , '' Trump said . `` It 's not really a choice . Do n't have a choice . They have to make a deal . ''\nIf and when the Senate bill passes , it will then go to the House for a vote .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her own massive economic stimulus proposal , the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act , Monday afternoon on Capitol Hill , in case the Senate bill fails .\n`` I think there is opportunity -- real optimism that we could get something done the next few hours , '' Pelosi said , complimenting Senate Democrats for their efforts to make the bill less for corporate America and more beneficial to workers .\n`` If we do n't have unanimous consent , my two options with my members is to call them back to vote to amend this bill , or to pass our own bill and go to conference with that , '' she added .\nThe president \u2019 s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed hope that at the end of the 15-day period , the administration can reassess and -- with the sign-off health officials -- target certain areas in the country where there \u2019 s a low occurrence of coronavirus spread to resume more normal economic functions .\nWhite House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow talks with reporters about economic impacts of the coronavirus , outside the White House , March 24 , 2020 . Evan Vucci/AP\n`` We will take another look at the possibility of targeting areas that are safe enough . We have to do this with the assent and help of the health specialists . No question about that . It 's just a matter of where it 's possible to open places that are not hot zones , for example , in order to try to expand the business reach and reduce the shut-in that 's taken over the economy , '' Kudlow said on FOX Business .\nHe further expanded on the idea of targeting specific zones speaking with reporters , emphasizing that the president \u2019 s economic advisers aren \u2019 t advising an `` either/or scenario '' but arguing that `` public health includes economic health . ''\n`` If we can target zones where viruses is less prevalent , think it \u2019 s safe , '' Kudlow said . `` We 're not abandoning the health professionals advice but there is a clamor to try to reopen the economy and , perhaps , cause less of a shut in . ''\nI asked Kudlow specifically about the idea of letting younger people who are not in high-risk groups return to work sooner .\n`` I do n't want to be specific , that 's logical , '' Kudlow told me but the added jokingly `` You got some old codgers who are pretty healthy too . ''\nAsked about how the federal government \u2013 practically speaking \u2013 can reopen parts of the economy that have shuttered given that local governments are by and large the ones calling the shots , Kudlow said it would come in the form of `` guidance '' and conceded that local governments are pulling many of the levers .\nVice President Mike Pence speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House , March 21 , 2020 , in Washington .

We are doing more than South Korea by a lot.\"\n\nBirx said that while the U.S. has completed over 300,000 tests, \"We have more to do.\"\n\n\"Is everything cool with you and Dr. Fauci?\" Trump was asked. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a key member of the coronavirus task force, has candidly contradicted the president on certain overstatements in recent days, including the president's optimism over drugs for coronavirus treatment despite no drugs currently being approved to treat it.\n\n\"He has other things to do. We get along very well ... we're fine, we're fine,\" Trump said, complimenting the team of doctors on the coronavirus task force as \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\"If we delay this out, you are going to lose more people than you are losing with the situation as we know it,\" Trump said. \"I think it's very important for our country to go back. I've had many, many people -- when he said 'it's a little bit controversial' -- not to most people. Most people said I'm right about it.\"\n\nHours after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, blasted the federal response, but not Trump by name -- saying FEMA sending 400 ventilators didn't cut it when New York needed tens of thousands -- Trump signaled the lack of ventilators was actually Cuomo's fault.\n\nPrepared to respond to Cuomo's harsh criticism, Trump was handed a piece of paper from someone off camera and read it off:\n\n\"This says New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying 16,000 ventilators in 2015,\" Trump said. \"So he had a chance to buy in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price, and he turned it down. I'm not blaming him or anything else. But he shouldn't be talking about us. He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators.\"\n\nLater on, Trump said that the federal government's relationship with governors is a \"two-way street,\" adding, \"Then I hear that there's a problem with ventilators. Well we sent them ventilators. And they could have had 15 or 16,000 two years ago and all they had to do was order them. They can't blame us for that.\"\n\nTrump envisions \u201cpacked churches\u201d for Easter\n\nAsked by Fox News\u2019 Bill Hemmer in a one-on-one interview taped after an earlier town hall why he chose Easter as the date by which he wanted the country \u201copened up,\u201d Trump said one reason is because it would be \u201cbeautiful\u201d to have the churches full.\n\n\u201cEaster\u2019s a very special day for me. And I see it\u2019s sort of in that timeline that I\u2019m thinking about. And I say, wouldn\u2019t it be great to have all of the churches full?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think Easter Sunday -- and you\u2019ll have packed churches all over our country -- I think it would be a beautiful time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just about the timeline that I think is right,\u201d the president continued. \u201cIt gives us more of a chance to work on what we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day, but I would like to aim it right at Easter Sunday.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump is followed by Vice President Mike Pence as he arrives for the coronavirus response daily briefing at the White House, March 23, 2020. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nCuomo to Trump: \"Act like it's a war\"\n\nMoments ahead of Trump\u2019s town hall, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a fiery daily news conference on COVID-19, blasted the federal government\u2019s response to the outbreak, saying that it holds the power to produce life-saving ventilators and other equipment but isn't invoking it -- at the cost of human lives.\n\n\"FEMA says, 'we're sending 400 ventilators.' Really? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?\" Cuomo said. \"You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\"\n\n\"The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government, period,\" Cuomo continued, criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s delay in using the powers of the Defense Production Act. \"I need the ventilators in 14 days. Only the federal government has that power. And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me.\"\n\n\"The president said 'it's a war, it's a war.' Then act like it's a war,\" Cuomo added.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, appearing on a Fox News 'virtual town hall\" from the White House Rose Garden after Cuomo's complaints, said, \"I know we started our conversation this hour on the subject ventilators and the challenges the state of New York faces. I was so pleased to confirm that earlier today that FEMA, from the national stockpile, shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York -- and tomorrow there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile.\"\n\nTrump further signals rolling back social distancing guidelines\n\nPresident Trump doubled down on comments made Monday that Americans \"cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself\" referencing economic fallout amid social distancing guidelines designed to minimize fatalities due to COVID-19.\n\n\"Our people want to return to work,\" the president tweeted Tuesday morning. \"They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!\"\n\nAt Monday night's briefing, ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked the president if he's worried about the virus spreading unabated if the restrictions are lifted.\n\n\"We have two very, very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration,\" Trump said. \"Life is fragile and economies are fragile.\"\n\n\"If it were up to the doctors, they may say, 'Let's keep it shut down. Let's shut down the entire world because again you're up to 150 countries,'\" Trump said, when asked whether any doctors on the task force agreed with his suggestion that social distancing guidelines will pay off in weeks not months.\n\n\"So, let's shut down the entire world and when we shut it down, that'd be wonderful, and let's keep it shut for a couple of years. We can't do that,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also predicted \"there will be tremendous death\" from shutting down the economy and job losses, \"probably\" more than the disease would cause.\n\nHe's expected to expand on the topic in a town hall with Fox News Monday afternoon -- in an event appearing to replace, for now at least, the daily coronavirus task force briefing.\n\nState of the stimulus package: Negotiations continue, leaders signal Tuesday night vote\n\nAfter Senate Democrats successfully blocked the GOP-backed \"phase three\" $2 trillion coronavirus relief measure in its current form twice in 24 hours, negotiations between Senate leadership and the White House continue behind closed doors,\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., March 24, 2020. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed hope that the Senate would successfully vote to move forward on the stimulus bill from the floor Tuesday morning and again slammed his Democratic colleagues for the unforeseen delays.\n\n\"The clock has run out, the buzzer is sounded, the hour for bargaining as though this were business as usual has expired,\" McConnell said.\n\nA little after midnight, Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin and director of White House Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland emerged from their final meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his top staff.\n\nAll parties said there were a few remaining issues to lock down but that they were nearly done -- and expect a deal.\n\n\"There's still a few little differences,\" Schumer said. \"Neither of us think they\u2019re in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement.\"\n\nThe Democratic leader said the Senate would \"hopefully vote on it\" Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump said in Monday's night briefing that Republicans and Democrats \"have no choice\" but to reach a deal.\n\n\"I got a call a little while ago. I guess they're getting closer. Should go quickly and must go quickly,\" Trump said. \"It's not really a choice. Don't have a choice. They have to make a deal.\"\n\nIf and when the Senate bill passes, it will then go to the House for a vote.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her own massive economic stimulus proposal, the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, Monday afternoon on Capitol Hill, in case the Senate bill fails.\n\nPelosi outlined her options forward on CNBC this morning.\n\n\"I think there is opportunity -- real optimism that we could get something done the next few hours,\" Pelosi said, complimenting Senate Democrats for their efforts to make the bill less for corporate America and more beneficial to workers.\n\n\"If we don't have unanimous consent, my two options with my members is to call them back to vote to amend this bill, or to pass our own bill and go to conference with that,\" she added.\n\nKudlow: Public health includes economic health\n\nThe president\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed hope that at the end of the 15-day period, the administration can reassess and -- with the sign-off health officials -- target certain areas in the country where there\u2019s a low occurrence of coronavirus spread to resume more normal economic functions.\n\nWhite House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow talks with reporters about economic impacts of the coronavirus, outside the White House, March 24, 2020. Evan Vucci/AP\n\n\"We will take another look at the possibility of targeting areas that are safe enough. We have to do this with the assent and help of the health specialists. No question about that. It's just a matter of where it's possible to open places that are not hot zones, for example, in order to try to expand the business reach and reduce the shut-in that's taken over the economy,\" Kudlow said on FOX Business.\n\nHe further expanded on the idea of targeting specific zones speaking with reporters, emphasizing that the president\u2019s economic advisers aren\u2019t advising an \"either/or scenario\" but arguing that \"public health includes economic health.\"\n\n\"If we can target zones where viruses is less prevalent, think it\u2019s safe,\" Kudlow said. \"We're not abandoning the health professionals advice but there is a clamor to try to reopen the economy and, perhaps, cause less of a shut in.\"\n\nI asked Kudlow specifically about the idea of letting younger people who are not in high-risk groups return to work sooner.\n\n\"I don't want to be specific, that's logical,\" Kudlow told me but the added jokingly \"You got some old codgers who are pretty healthy too.\"\n\nAsked about how the federal government \u2013 practically speaking \u2013 can reopen parts of the economy that have shuttered given that local governments are by and large the ones calling the shots, Kudlow said it would come in the form of \"guidance\" and conceded that local governments are pulling many of the levers.\n\nVice President Mike Pence speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, March 21, 2020, in Washington. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nFEMA administrator says Defense Production Act powers will be used 'today'\n\nA few hours after President Trump this morning tweeted his astonishment at the difficulty of obtaining face masks and ventilators from the international marketplace, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said on CNN that the administration planned to use the Defense Production Act for the first time today during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\"We're going to use the DPA for the first time today,\" Gaynor said, adding they would use \"the allocation portion of the DPA\" for \"about 60,000 test kits\" that \"we need to get our hands on.\"\n\nGaynor also said they would use the DPA Tuesday to \"insert some language into these mask contracts we have for the 500 million masks.\"\n\nTrump tweeted hours before that the market is \"Crazy,\" as he acknowledged that it is \"not easy\" obtaining the desperately needed equipment for states.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\n\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: coronavirus explained\n\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: coronavirus symptoms\n\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: coronavirus map\n\nABC News' Ben Gittleson, Jordyn Phelps, John Parkinson, Trish Turner and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report.\n\nThis report was featured in the Wednesday, March 25, 2020, episode of \u201cStart Here,\u201d ABC News\u2019 daily news podcast.\n\n\"Start Here\" offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.
