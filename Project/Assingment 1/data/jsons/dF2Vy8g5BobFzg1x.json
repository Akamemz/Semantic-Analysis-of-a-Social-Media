Gerrymandering was pioneered two centuries ago in 1812 by Massachusetts Gov . Elbridge Gerry .\nThe lines are drawn with devious precision , most often to guarantee that each party remains in control of particular districts . The new lines also will serve to preserve or exacerbate the ideological polarization of Congress for the next five sessions .\n\u201c Gerrymandering certainly locks in districts for one party or the other for essentially the whole decade , \u201d and it occurred this year at a time when the House already is at a high-water mark for hyperpartisanship as well as Republican domination , said Douglas Johnson , a fellow at the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at California \u2019 s Claremont McKenna College .\nMany members of Congress no longer represent communities the way residents think of them , but rather areas containing slivers of many cities hundreds of miles apart .\n\u201c A legislator will do whatever he or she wants with virtually no accountability because anyone who might try to challenge an incumbent \u2014 a mayor or any other local official \u2014 has his own base split up , \u201d Mr. Johnson said .\nThough gerrymandering is done to protect incumbents , in the long term , it leads to ever-increasing extremes as districts carved with partisanship in mind remove the need for candidates to moderate for middle-ground voters .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a danger for incumbents when a seat is too safe : There \u2019 s an incentive for more extreme candidates in the primary because the general no longer matters , \u201d Mr. Johnson said , conjuring the tea party challengers who knocked longtime moderate Republicans from their perches .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 used mathematical formulas to identify boundaries that least resemble the squares or circles that one might expect and found that Maryland had the least-compact districts in the nation , even lower than Hawaii \u2019 s islands . That \u2019 s in part a result of the state \u2019 s unique shape , but mostly because of a redistricting plan from the Democrat-controlled Maryland General Assembly viewed as so partisan that a referendum on it also was on the Nov. 6 ballot .\nWest Virginia , North Carolina , Louisiana , Pennsylvania , Illinois and Virginia rounded out the list of states with most-tortured districts .\n\u201c When there \u2019 s one party in control , there \u2019 s no real check , \u201d Mr. Johnson said .\nIn Illinois , Democrats took four seats from Republicans on Election Day , and in North Carolina , Republicans took three formerly Democratic seats . The GOP-controlled legislature there did so in part by drawing areas that lumped Democratic strongholds into one , forcing the state \u2019 s Democratic lawmakers to fight one another , as it did with Reps. David Price and Brad Miller when it drew a map that included Mr. Price \u2019 s town and then snaked out to rope in Mr. Miller \u2019 s residence .\n\u201c If it were not for the trees in the way , I could hit the 13th District with a sand wedge from my home in the 4th District , \u201d Mr. Miller , who decided not to run for re-election as a result , told The Times .\nNorth Carolina , which has spawned numerous Supreme Court cases involving reapportionment , has a law requiring districts to follow existing political boundaries , such as counties , where possible , but it was not applied because of legal wrangling , he said .\n\u201c If the legal requirement of not dividing counties unnecessarily had applied , we \u2019 d have fairly reasonable districts that people would look at and not think of as an embarrassment , \u201d Mr. Miller said .\nIn Maryland , Democrats decided that having two conservative members of the U.S. House out of eight was too many , and Republican Roscoe G. Bartlett \u2019 s 18-year run in the House ended when they radically changed the composition of his district by adding the Democrat-heavy Washington suburbs .\n\u201c You look at the map , and basically they carved it up like a Thanksgiving turkey , \u201d said Tony Campbell , president of Marylanders for Coherent and Fair Representation , which backed the referendum that would have forced the state to redraw its lines in time for the 2014 elections .\nMr. Bartlett is \u201c 86 years old ; it \u2019 s not like he was going to be in office for the next 10 years anyway , \u201d he said , adding that \u201c Maryland is not only dominated by Democrats , but they feel like they can \u2019 t be touched . \u201d\nThe referendum to re-redraw the boundaries got only 36 percent of the vote , which Mr. Campbell attributed to ballot language written by Democrats that simply asked whether voters supported \u201c boundaries for the state \u2019 s eight United States congressional districts based on recent census figures , as required by the United States Constitution . \u201d\nBut the results showed that even many Democrats who were happy to see their party gain seats were disgusted with the way they did so , he said .\nOn the other end of the spectrum , previous excesses in redistricting have led to the formation of independent , nonpartisan commissions , in California beginning this time and in Arizona a decade ago . The lesser protection to incumbents was immediately visible : Of 63 House seats that changed parties this year , 15 were in California and four were in Arizona .\nData-mining technology has made gerrymandering more effective in the years since computers have become common .\n\u201c Over the last couple decades , gerrymandering is definitely getting worse . We \u2019 re seeing people really finely tune the lines using the amazing amount of data available . One of the protections against gerrymandering 20 or 30 years ago was simply that the data wasn \u2019 t that good , \u201d Mr. Johnson said .\nMeanwhile , the means by which the media inform constituents about the people hoping to represent them has lagged behind , with newspapers laying off reporters and struggling to cover one congressman and his challengers now attempting to provide scrutiny of several districts that crisscross through their coverage areas .\n\u201c They \u2019 re actually divvying up TV and newspaper markets , and the newspapers don \u2019 t have the resources to cover them . There \u2019 s an added level of advantage to incumbents , \u201d Mr. Johnson said .\nIncumbents , who have a built-in financial advantage , also gain when challengers have to pay to advertise in each of those markets . In North Carolina \u2019 s 9th District , which is 80 miles long and 1.5 miles wide at points , Republican Robert Pittenger will replace retiring GOP Rep. Sue Myrick , but only after a chaotic campaign in the multimarket district that had 10 candidates in the Republican primary , each with a different geographical base of support .\nBy Election Day , the race cost more than any other House race in the state , and if Mrs. Myrick were not retiring , no one would have had the resources to take her on .\nThe Times \u2019 algorithm suggested that new districts across the nation are slightly more compact than those from 2001 , in part because of California \u2019 s improvements , but that some states , including Louisiana , Kentucky , North Carolina and Illinois , have become worse .\nNot all irregularly shaped districts are the result of sheer partisanship .
