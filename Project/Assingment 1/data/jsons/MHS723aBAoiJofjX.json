Many since have focused on Trump \u2019 s record-high 39 percent margin among whites without a college degree . Few have focused on what this means : Trump \u2014 and the Republican party \u2014 owe the presidency to millions of whites who have largely voted Democratic for years . The implications of that for the future of the Republican party are immense .\nTrump \u2019 s appeal to white non-college-educated Democrats and independents is clear with even a cursory glance at the election map . Take closely balanced Michigan , which Trump leads as of this writing by 12,000 votes . He carried the state by winning all but eight counties , including historically Democratic places such as Saginaw , Bay , and Gogebic counties .

Gogebic , a 92 percent white county on Michigan \u2019 s Upper Peninsula , hasn \u2019 t voted for the GOP since 1972 .\nThe pattern is identical in other midwestern states that Trump won narrowly . He carried Wisconsin largely because he won ten white , historically Democratic counties in the southwestern part of the state that even Gore and Kerry won in their races against George W. Bush . Most of these counties had not been carried by the GOP nominee since George H. W. Bush in 1988 or Reagan in 1984 ; Republicans had not won Pepin and Kenosha since 1972 . Trump swept Iowa by winning virtually every eastern county , places that had voted Democratic in every election since 1988 .
