Mickler Jr. Student journalism at Georgetown can be traced as far back as 1824 to the appearance of a hand-copied publication titled \u201cMinerva.\u201d The Hoya, however, was distinguished from previous student publications by its intent to be a comprehensive university newspaper. The publication took its name from the phrase \u201cHoya Saxa,\u201d which had been adopted as a common chant at Georgetown sports events in the 1890s. The popularity of the term spread as local newspapers often cited The Hoya, and \u201cHoya\u201d began to be widely applied to campus organizations and to athletic groups.\n\nThe First 40 Years\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, the publication shifted its main coverage from athletic to campus events. Weathering the Great Depression, World War II, student unrest in the 1960s and funding cuts in the 1970s, The Hoya has appeared almost continuously since its founding, providing a student perspective on issues and events.\n\nIn its early years, The Hoya published once a week, focused mainly on internal, campus affairs, promoting student organizations and school functions, and devoted a large part of its coverage to sports. In 1930, The Hoya received the highest rating given to a college weekly publication by the National Collegiate Press Association.\n\nIn the late 1930s, international events began to influence content. The Hoya was one of the few student groups to remain active during the war years, and its pages at this time juxtapose coverage of blood drives, war bond programs and alumni casualties with details of tea dances and intramural athletics.\n\nIn the post-war era, the paper\u2019s focus returned to internal campus issues, perhaps reflecting the desire of veterans, who made up most of the student body, to return to normal life.

The paper already had a long tradition of providing coverage and reviews of both on-campus and off-campus entertainment, with reviews of off-campus plays and movies first appearing in 1929.\n\nIn 1998, The Hoya launched a website, thehoya.com.
