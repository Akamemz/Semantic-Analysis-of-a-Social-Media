In retrospect , he said , he still believes he made the right choice .\n`` Look , this was terrible . It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election . But honestly , it would n't change the decision , '' he said .\nComey 's remarks were his first public comment on his decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation , which came after FBI agents discovered new communications connected to the former secretary of state 's private server . Comey 's letter to congressional leaders informing them of the action was immediately leaked , and Clinton says it contributed to her loss on Election Day .\nWednesday 's testimony by Comey came during what was intended to be a routine oversight hearing of the FBI , but was instead dominated by questions relating to investigations surrounding the 2016 campaign .\nSenators also asked Comey about Russia . He said Russia represents `` the greatest threat of any nation on Earth , given their intention and capability .

He said the bureau `` did n't say a word '' about the Russia-Trump probe `` until months into it , '' and that he expects `` we 're not gon na say another peep about it until we 're done . '' He insisted that was the way the bureau handled the Clinton investigation as well .\nThe repercussions from Comey 's action continue to reverberate across the political spectrum . At a forum in New York on Tuesday , Clinton said Comey 's letter to Congress on Oct. 28 was a factor in her loss to President Trump . `` If the election had been on Oct. 27 , I would be your president , '' she said , while also putting responsibility for her loss on her own actions .\nTrump tweeted later Tuesday night that Comey `` was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds .
