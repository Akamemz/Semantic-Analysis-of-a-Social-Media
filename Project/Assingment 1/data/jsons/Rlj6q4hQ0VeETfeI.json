    "content": "During the next six weeks the nation \u2019 s 51 million public school students , with the assistance of their parents , would normally be preparing for the next phase of their education . This year , despite the absence of scientific data indicating that a return to in-person class attendance increases the risk that students or educators will contract COVID-19 , the teachers \u2019 unions are resisting school reopening . This flouts the will of parents whose taxes pay the teachers , disregards the failure of large-scale distance learning , and ignores the emotional damage children suffer pursuant to the social disruption that accompanies school closures . According to a recent Gallup survey , a clear majority of parents want schools reopened :\nFifty-six percent of parents with children who attend a K-12 school prefer their children \u2019 s instruction be fully in person this fall . Meanwhile , 37 % prefer a hybrid program in which students attend school part time and do some distance learning , while 7 % want full-time distance learning for their children .\nIn other words , most parents agree with President Trump \u2019 s position as he summarized it during his July 7 remarks concerning the urgent necessity of reopening the schools : \u201c Everybody wants it . The moms want it , the dads want it , the kids want it . It \u2019 s time to do it. \u201d Yet Randi Weingarten , the president of the American Federation of Teachers ( AFT ) , published a column in Sunday \u2019 s edition of USA Today threatening to hold public school systems hostage until the taxpayers cough up a $ 116.5 billion ransom . She admits that this would constitute a 19 percent increase over pre-virus funding : \u201c The average school will need an additional $ 1.2 million \u2026 above what we currently spend . \u201d\nEvidently , Weingarten is unable to see that brazen exploitation of the epidemic by AFT , combined with crazy demands to defund the police by affiliates like United Teachers Los Angeles ( UTLA ) , is a political loser for her Democratic vassals \u2014 including their presidential nominee . The latter will be forced to defend the teachers \u2019 unions while Trump increases pressure on him to choose between them and the children . If the schools aren \u2019 t open by Election Day , there will be Hell to pay for Biden . By that time , the parents ( i.e . the voters ) will exact a gruesome revenge at the ballot box . Yet our erstwhile vice president continues to bray pseudo-scientific balderdash such as this :\nThis year going back to school is going to look very different . And we know how hard it \u2019 s going to be for families all across the country.\u2026 Everyone wants our schools to reopen . The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick . Forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous .\nThis nonsense has been repeatedly debunked by epidemiologists such as John Ioannidis of Stanford University and Knut M. Wittkowski of Rockefeller University . Moreover , as Liz Harrington at Townhall reports , \u201c Twenty-two European countries reopened their schools back in May , and it did not cause \u2018 any significant increase in coronavirus infections among children , parents , or staff. \u2019 \u201d Scientific studies have been conducted in Germany , Ireland , and France that independently reached the same conclusion .

Presumably they think that , if the schools remain shuttered , millions of parents will be unable to return to work pursuant to the absence of child care . This would , according to the scenario , prevent the economy from recovering \u2014 a failure the Democrats hope voters will blame on President Trump . The problem with this plan is their assumption that the electorate is largely made up of morons , particularly Trump supporters .
