    "content": "It \u2019 s been quite a week for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt .\nOn Thursday , we learned \u2014 thanks to reports in Climatewire and the New York Times \u2014 that he met with coal executives and lobbyists at a meeting of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity and promised them `` red team , blue team '' exercises to evaluate climate science . ( The broad consensus among scientists and other climate experts is that such debates are wholly unnecessary , given that we already have excellent systems in place to vet climate science , and that the fundamentals of climate science are incontrovertible at this point . ) It was a clear signal that Pruitt intends to take government-sanctioned climate skepticism to the next level .\nEarlier in the week , Pruitt went before the Senate Appropriations Committee to explain how he was returning the agency \u201c back to basics. \u201d Under his new and improved management , he claimed it was on course to better fulfill its \u201c core \u201d missions even while seeking 31 percent fewer funds and a 25 percent smaller staff .\nAn announcement that same day suggested how he was seeking to do so : by paring back even the most core of its missions , clean water . The proposed repeal of the Waters of the US rule , the Obama administration \u2019 s decision about which waterways should be subject to pollution control , will withdraw EPA oversight of waters from which over 100 million now Americans drink .\nDemocrats and even a few Republicans didn \u2019 t buy Pruitt \u2019 s budget pitch . \u201c We have rejected changes like these in the past , and I will certainly push my colleagues to do so again this year , \u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski , a Republican from Alaska .\nBut Pruitt and his staff have already ripped into the agency quickly and deeply , as my colleagues at the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative and I detail in a recent report .\nWe are a group of academics , and as part of our effort to track the new administration \u2019 s impacts on environmental agencies and science , we conducted more than 50 in-depth interviews with EPA employees . We found that morale there has plummeted , anxiety is rife , science is being choked off , and much work has been paralyzed . Our report , along with the news reports of Pruitt \u2019 s anti-science antics this week , confirms that Trump and Pruitt pose the biggest threat the EPA has faced in its 47 years of existence .\nPruitt is trying to attack the EPA \u2019 s mores and mission in secret\nAmong the many parts of the \u201c deep state \u201d now under attack by the Trump Administration , the EPA has been singled out , in startling fulfillment of the president \u2019 s campaign promise to break the agency into \u201c little tidbits. \u201d Pruitt , the assigned hitman , earned his appointment by snuggling up to oil and gas industries as Oklahoma \u2019 s attorney general , then leading 14 lawsuits against the EPA .\nWith single-minded , often secretive methods , he has led a charge to breakdown the agency \u2019 s mores and mission . In its overt hostility and in the pressures it has brought to bear , this assault has surpassed that during the early months of Ronald Reagan \u2019 s first term , long recognized as the darkest years in agency history .\nPruitt \u2019 s inaugural speech pledged his devotion only to the law and histories written by right-wing ideologues , without even the lip service to protecting health or the environment mustered by Reagan \u2019 s first EPA administrator , Anne Gorsuch . Ronald Reagan never deigned to visit EPA headquarters , but Trump and Mike Pence already have , the only president and vice-president ever to do so to provoke rather than praise .\nUpon their visit , employees were literally shut out of their own auditorium , as energy industry representatives and their politician friends filled the seats . Agency staff told us they could only watch over closed-circuit TV as Pence joined Trump to declare the agency \u2019 s \u201c war on coal \u201d and its \u201c attack on American industry \u201d to be over . As \u201c in-your-face insulting [ a ] thing as I \u2019 ve experienced in my time here , \u201d reflected one who \u2019 d been at the agency since the 1970s .\nThe war on the EPA has been swift and brutal . The budget put forth by the White House for fiscal year 2018 , which Pruitt defended before Congress , signaled an unmistakably hostile intent to those inside the agency .\nEPA has been slated for single-year reductions broader and deeper than any put forth by the Reagan White House , and the largest for any major federal agency . They target climate change programs and scientific research but also much more : 47 programs would be eliminated entirely and 50 to 90 percent slices taken from many others , across nearly every facet of EPA \u2019 s mission .\nAs Murkowski and several other congressmen signaled this week , the deep budget cuts will be turned back by Congress . But Trump \u2019 s executive orders , more numerous and altogether more ambitious than Reagan \u2019 s first , are already cutting broad swathes across the agency , without approval or oversight from legislators .\nSome target whipping boys of conservatives from the Obama era , like the \u201c Waters of the US \u201d rule and the Clean Power Plan , but the more sweeping ones \u2014 to get rid of two old rules for every new one , to review existing rules for \u201c burdensomeness , \u201d to reorganize with a view to downsizing \u2014 may well inflict the deepest wounds . Together they are driving a host of internal deliberations aimed almost entirely at curtailing what the agency does and can do .\nAmong the agency \u2019 s many familiar ways of working , Pruitt has placed its original and long-standing reliance on science most squarely on his chopping block . That his chief of staff may have pressured a member of the EPA \u2019 s Board of Scientific Counselors to alter Congressional testimony , as reported Tuesday in the New York Times , is only the latest step in a campaign to decimate that board , and more generally , sever the agency \u2019 s ties to the academic scientific community .\nRelated Donald Trump is handing the federal government over to fossil fuel interests\nPruitt and his staff have also pointedly disregarded the agency \u2019 s own scientific staff . Their reversal of the previous administration \u2019 s ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos , done reportedly without consulting experts in the pesticide office , but instead , we 've just learned , after a private meeting with the CEO of the chemical 's manufacturer , set an early precedent . While the agency \u2019 s use and pursuit of science also faced similar challenges during the early Reagan years , never have these been so overt or systematic . \u201c We \u2019 re not going to be doing much science anymore , \u201d one of our interviewees opined .\nPruitt has also proven to be not just a more experienced but also a savvier operator than Reagan 's Gorsuch , at least so far . He has furnished a veneer of coherence to it all by touting agency \u201c originalism , \u201d a \u201c return \u201d of the EPA to its \u201c basic \u201d statutory obligations . The agency \u2019 s internal publicity , featuring his handshake with a coal miner , not so subtly warns agency staff to return \u201c back to basics , \u201d though exactly how far \u201c back \u201d and to which \u201c basics \u201d is left rather ominously unclear .\nPruitt \u2019 s testimony Tuesday and two weeks prior , before a House committee , did highlight a couple of EPA programs he now pledges to improve : the Superfund ( despite proposing a 25 percent cut to its budget ) , and toxic substances control , by implementing a 2016 reform law . Given what else employees have seen from him , such vows look like obligatory window-dressing , obscuring a broader intent of reducing the agency to a shadow of its former self .\nThe Trump administration is on track to wreak greater damage than the Reagan administration\nOn all these fronts , the current assault on the agency is well on track to wreak greater havoc than Reagan did . Back then , Democrats controlling House and the many Republicans still supporting the agency were able to limit EPA \u2019 s losses over Gorsuch \u2019 s two years to 20 percent of its budget and 26 percent of its staff .\nToday , with Republicans in control of Congress through 2018 and so many of them utterly hostile to the agency and its work , Trump and Pruitt have every opportunity to deal the agency a more crippling blow . Many longtime employees told us think that \u2019 s precisely what will happen .\nPruitt \u2019 s secretive and closed-circle decision-making has exacerbated agency employees \u2019 anxieties and disgruntlement . New internal hurdles have arisen for the work at hand , as formerly routine matters from informational webinars to enforcement actions now need approval from the administrator \u2019 s office .\nWhile not unusual for presidential transitions , the current bottlenecks have been exacerbated by the historic slowness with which mid-level political appointees are being nominated and approved \u2014 in part , employees say , because who would give up a good business job to \u201c dismantle an agency or try to run a program with no money and no staff. \u201d Even those staffers reluctant to criticize admit to disarray ; others frankly describe their office as in a state of \u201c near paralysis . \u201d\nLittle wonder , then , that so many long-serving employees in Pruitt \u2019 s EPA report morale there to be lower than they 've ever seen . The \u201c consensus \u201d among many is that \u201c at bottom , \u201d the new leadership is \u201c basically trying to destroy the place. \u201d This inhospitable a workplace is no accident ; it furthers a goal Pruitt reaffirmed at his hearing , of shrinking the agency \u2019 s workforce .\nSome have already resigned , in more or less vocal protest , and a new round of buy-out offers has many others contemplating leaving . Other staff are gritting their teeth and working with the newcomers , or else keeping their heads down , to sustain as much as they can of their own sense of the agency \u2019 s mission .\nAs in the early Reagan years , the leaks to the press have begun , and employee unions are showing a new feistiness . Of course , EPA employees themselves can only do so much to uphold the agency and its mission in the face of this onslaught . They need support and supporters , more so now than ever before .\nOne key determinant of the agency \u2019 s future , especially with prospects so dim for the Congressional hearings that effectively confronted Gorsuch \u2019 s EPA , is whether the media , and environmental and other citizen groups can stand in . Can they shine and sustain enough light on destructive decisions and corrupt dealings inside the agency ?\nCan they illuminate the health , community , and ecological consequences of slashing its staff and programs , enough to make a political stir ? And if they can , will enough Republicans find the courage , and Democrats the willingness to join with them , to revive the EPA \u2019 s long legacy of bipartisan support ?\nToday \u2019 s leadership has brought the EPA to a critical juncture . We may be on the threshold of a harsh new era of hands-off environmental governance , that will worsen Americans \u2019 mounting environmental vulnerabilities . More hopefully , with enough of a civic and political groundswell , we may remember the current assault on the EPA like we do Reagan \u2019 s , as trauma that proved temporary and passing .\nChristopher Sellers is professor of history at Stony Brook University , a fellow at the Wilson Center , and on the steering committee of the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative ( EDGI ) .
