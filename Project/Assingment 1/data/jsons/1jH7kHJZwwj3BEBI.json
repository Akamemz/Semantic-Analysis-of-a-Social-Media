    "content": "More than a week into the glitch-littered launch of the ObamaCare insurance `` exchanges , '' critics are decrying the roll-out as a `` train wreck '' that should give everyone pause about requiring individuals to use the new system -- or obtain insurance elsewhere -- by early 2014 .\n`` How can we tax people for not buying a product from a website that does n't work ? '' House Speaker John Boehner said .\nThe healthcare.gov site opened for enrollment on Oct. 1 , but users are still having trouble breaking through the website 's myriad problems just to sign up .\nReports have since surfaced about warning signs that the site was not ready for launch ; raising more questions , another report said the price tag for the site has grown from $ 93 million to $ 634 million .\nThe administration all along has tried to explain the problems as a product of the overwhelming interest in the insurance products on the site -- a matter of sheer volume .\nBut critics say the site was just poorly designed . Computer software experts told FoxNews.com the site may experience significant technical glitches for months .\n`` I would n't rule out that possibility , '' said George Edwards , a computer scientist and professor at the University of Southern California .
