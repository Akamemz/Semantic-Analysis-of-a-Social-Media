    "content": "He was a revolutionary and a liberator : delivering his island nation from the colonial powers and mafia dons that ruled over it from the 16th century halfway into the 20th , and inspiring other independence movements in Latin America and Africa .\nHe was a dictator and a despot : delivering basic needs but denying basic rights , ultimately turning his nation of 10 million people into what some considered a collective gulag where the individual with a differing political vision was shown the door \u2013 to prison or to exile , or even to the firing squad .\nFidel Castro Ruz , who died late Friday night after nearly a half-century of rule over Cuba , leaves the world stage a larger-than-life icon of nationalism and collective struggle . His brother , President Raul Castro , dressed in military uniform , somberly announced the news on state television , concluding with Fidel Castro 's revolutionary rallying cry : `` To victory , always ! ''\nSimply \u201c Fidel \u201d to a world that across much of its southern half was for decades drawn to his vision of third-world freedom and social liberation , Mr. Castro loved to brag that he had outlasted six \u2013 then seven , eight , nine , and ultimately 10 \u2013 US presidents , all of whom had sought his demise . But that only underscored the degree to which the Castro mystique and legitimacy depended on a belligerent imperialist power only 90 miles across the Florida Straits .\nDuring his long tenure , Mr. Castro ushered communism into Cuba and brought the US and Cuba to the brink of war during the Cuban Missile Crisis . But he lived to see diplomatic ties with the US restored in 2015 , and President Obama visit the isolated island earlier this year . He served as an inspiration to revolutionary figures in Latin America and Africa , and set the stage for leftist leaders who swept to power across the region in the late 1990s and early 2000s , most notably Venezuela \u2019 s former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez , who referred to Castro as his mentor and father . But he also watched his influence wane as democracy and capitalism gained ground .\nWhether Cuba is one of the longest-running experiments in social equality or a state ruined under a dictatorship , it \u2019 s indissoluble from the man known by many as simply \u201c Fidel. \u201d His mixed legacy will be debated for years to come . His power on the world stage , while largely symbolic at the time of his death , was emblematic enough that it continues to inspire long after the close of the cold war .\nHow Castro is remembered \u201c depends on where you stand , \u201d says Riordan Roett , director of Latin America studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . \u201c The left will always hold Castro in high regard as someone who overthrew a dictatorship \u201d and who embodies Cuban nationalism . \u201c But if you \u2019 re on the right , you see repression of the press and of opposition voices . \u201d\nCastro stepped down in February 2008 , just months before the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution , handing power to his younger brother , Raul Castro . While still under Castro rule , Cuba has undertaken economic reforms and most recently normalized relations with the United States \u2013 a move for which the elder Castro offered his carefully hedged support of in a letter .\n\u201c I do not trust the politics of the United States , nor have I exchanged a word with them , but this is not , in any way , a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts , \u201d Fidel wrote in a letter that was read to a student group marking the 70th anniversary of his graduation from the University of Havana .\nHe added that Raul had \u201c taken the relevant steps in line with the prerogatives and authorities awarded to him by the National Assembly and the Cuban Communist Party . \u201d\nOfficial ties between the US and Cuba long seemed unfathomable \u2013 from the heady day a bearded , fatigue-clad , air-punching revolutionary descended from the Sierra Muestra and entered Havana in 1959 to overthrow Fulgencio Batista .\n\u201c Before Castro , Cuba was a banana republic , \u201d says Wayne Smith , a former chief of the US interests section in Havana and now a senior fellow of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington . \u201c He turned it into a player on the world stage . \u201d\nAfter taking power , Castro quickly moved to redistribute property and make access to health care a human right . When Castro \u2019 s guerrilla forces triumphed in 1959 , one-quarter of Cubans could not read or write . Today , the literacy rate is near universal \u2013 a model shipped to other developing countries \u2013 and Cuba \u2019 s infant mortality rate is one of the lowest in the world . Racism persists , but not nearly as palpably as in other Latin American nations .\nAt the same time , Castro showed little tolerance for those who did not support his regime , executing his most vociferous foes and jailing thousands of political dissidents . He shut down media outlets , replacing them with a state voice . Elections were merely rubber-stamp events . He set up neighborhood groups that created a level of paranoia that could hang over every transaction in Cuba , and instituted a feared secret police .\nBut his ideals , in the end , were hardly sustainable . All Cubans get food supplies , but food has been rationed since 1962 , and the nation failed to support industry . With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 came the collapse of Cuba . In 1980 , when the government announced that anyone who wished to leave the island could , tens of thousands left in an exodus for Miami , in what is now known as the Mariel boat lift . Today roughly 2 million Cuban-Americans live in the United States , more than 1 million in southern Florida .\n\u201c The fact that he survived the loss of the Soviet subsidy and then the pressures of a globalizing economy is one of the more remarkable parts of his legacy , \u201d says Mr. Smith . \u201c What Castro is , basically , is an egalitarian , and it may be that egalitarianism won \u2019 t be part of the 21st century . But , then again , the failings of the current direction suggest it may not be dead . \u201d\nCastro exported his ideals , and manpower , to revolutionaries around the world seeking to emulate his struggles in their own countries .\nHe was hailed for standing up to the US , through the Bay of Pigs , the Cuban Missile Crisis , and most defiantly in the face of trade restrictions slapped on by President Eisenhower in 1960 and a full trade embargo and stringent travel restrictions imposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 . Cuba was on the US list of state-supported terrorism until April 2015 .\nCastro continues to inspire many in the region . Even if communism is not the ideal , the push for a more just Latin America with wealth redistributed to the poor has been behind a slew of elections , from Venezuela \u2019 s ex-President Ch\u00e1vez to Evo Morales in Bolivia to the resurgence of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua .\n\u201c Latin America creates these larger than life characters : Juan Peron , Salvador Allende , Hugo Chavez , \u201d says Roett from Johns Hopkins . \u201c They all have their own little following and important place in Latin American history , but as time goes on \u2026 there aren \u2019 t a lot of people talking about them in the longer term . \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s not likely to be the case for Castro , he says .\n\u201c He really transformed how we look at the left in Latin America , \u201d Roett says . \u201c US foreign policy became reactive to Castro and eventually to others in the region . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a lasting legacy , a point underscored by just how much US-Latin American relations have changed since Castro \u2019 s time in power .
