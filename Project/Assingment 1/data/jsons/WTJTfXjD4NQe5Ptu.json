She opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history: \u201cThe winner is Sidney Poitier.\u201d\n\nUp to the stage came the most elegant man I had ever seen. I remembered his tie was white, and of course his skin was black, and I\u2019d never seen a black man being celebrated like that.

And I\u2019m especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories. Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell, and this year we became the story. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry. It\u2019s one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace.\n\nSo I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know. They are domestic workers and farmworkers.
