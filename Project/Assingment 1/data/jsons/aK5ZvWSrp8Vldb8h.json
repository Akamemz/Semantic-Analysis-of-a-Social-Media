    "content": "In a dramatic turnaround , President Obama said Saturday that he will wait for congressional authorization to punish Syria for a chemical weapons attack , even though he has decided a military strike is needed .\n\u201c We should have this debate , \u201d the president said in an announcement in the White House Rose Garden . \u201c I respect the views of those who call for caution . \u201d\nAfter more than a week of deliberation , Mr. Obama essentially put the onus on Congress to stop him from launching missile strikes against targets of the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad . Lawmakers are not scheduled to return from their August recess until Sept. 9 .\n\u201c I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets , \u201d Mr. Obama said , adding that he intends such action to be \u201c limited in duration and scope . \u201d\nWith Vice President Joseph R. Biden at his side , Mr. Obama said , \u201c I \u2019 m confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons , deter this kind of behavior , and degrade their capacity to carry it out . \u201d\nThe president said U.S. military forces are positioned in the region to strike at his command .\nSEE ALSO : ANALYSIS : Isolated Obama turns to Congress for support\n\u201c The chairman of the Joint Chiefs has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c Moreover , the chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive ; it will be effective tomorrow , or next week , or one month from now . And I \u2019 m prepared to give that order . \u201d\nBut he said he has consulted again with congressional leaders Saturday morning and will wait for lawmakers to vote on military action . The Democratic and Republican leaders of both the House and Senate have agreed to hold a debate and vote on a Syrian military strike , the president said .\n\u201c While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , \u201d the president said . \u201c Today I \u2019 m asking Congress to send a message to the world . \u201d\nThe announcement appears to delay any U.S. military move for 10 days or more . House GOP Speaker John Boehner and the chamber \u2019 s top Republicans immediately issued a joint statement praising Mr. Obama \u2019 s decision to consult Congress and saying the House would hold its vote when Congress returns to work .\n\u201c Under the Constitution , the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress , \u201d the House GOP leaders said . \u201c We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious , substantive questions being raised . In consultation with the president , we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9th . \u201d\nThe announcement came as a surprise because Mr. Obama had been signaling for the past several days that he intends to send a \u201c shot across the bow \u201d to the Syrian regime .
