They have ranged from knocks on China for withholding information about the coronavirus to warnings directed at American companies about working with Chinese brands due to their use of forced labor ; from admonitions about China 's actions in Hong Kong to condemnation for committing `` the stain of the century '' of human rights violations .\nThere have also been more general attacks , like one ominous Sunday night tweet from the State Department 's official account .\nCHINESE SPOKESPERSON SAYS US SHOULD 'STOP PLAYING DUMB ' ON NUCLEAR ARMS AGREEMENT\n`` @ SecPompeo : We are watching the world unite to come to understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party , '' it reads .\nPompeo , in a recent pair of speeches , has also taken explicit shots at China .\n`` China , in particular , is aggressively promoting a very different concept in which national priorities of various sorts prevail over the basic rights of speech , assembly , religious freedom , and free elections , '' Pompeo said Thursday at a speech about the State Department 's efforts on `` unalienable rights .
