Post : \u201c President Trump and his allies are working to block more than 20 separate investigations by Democrats \u2026 amounting to what many experts call the most expansive White House obstruction effort in decades. \u201d A May 11 article by The Washington Post detailed the all-out obstruction effort by President Donald Trump :\nPresident Trump and his allies are working to block more than 20 separate investigations by Democrats into his actions as president , his personal finances and his administration \u2019 s policies , according to a Washington Post analysis , amounting to what many experts call the most expansive White House obstruction effort in decades . Trump \u2019 s noncooperation strategy has shifted from partial resistance to all-out war as he faces mounting inquiries from the Democratic-controlled House \u2014 a strategy that many legal and congressional experts fear could undermine the institutional power of Congress for years to come . All told , House Democrats say the Trump administration has failed to respond to or comply with at least 79 requests for documents or other information . \u2026 Kerry W. Kircher , who served as House counsel for the last GOP majority , said the standoff marks \u201c a complete breakdown and complete obstruction of Congress \u2019 s role. \u201d \u201c If the court signs off on this stuff , then we \u2019 ll have an imperial presidency , \u201d Kircher said , adding : \u201c We \u2019 ll have a presidency that will be largely unchecked. \u201d [ The Washington Post , 5/11/19 ]\nDemocrats sound alarm over Trump \u2019 s refusal to submit to congressional oversight\nRep.

On a scale of one to 10 , how frustrated are you this morning ? REP. JERRY NADLER ( D-NY ) : Well , it 's not a question of frustration . The law must be vindicated . The American people must know what 's going on . Appropriate action , whatever that may be , must be taken and the president must not be permitted to operate a lawless administration and become a king . CAMEROTA : The term constitutional -- NADLER : And we will have to insist on that no matter how long it takes . We can not allow Donald Trump and his minions to convert a Democratic government into what amounts to a monarchy where Congress elected by the people has no real role . CAMEROTA : Look , it sounds like what you 're saying a monarchy but by another name it 's a constitutional crisis . Where do you think -- NADLER : Well , the phrase constitutional crisis has been overused , but certainly . CAMEROTA : Certainly what ? NADLER : Certainly it 's a constitutional crisis , although I do n't like to use that phrase because it 's been used for far less dangerous situations . The phrase has been overused . CAMEROTA : I hear you , but you feel that we are currently in a constitutional crisis or headed for one ? NADLER : No . No . We are in one . We are in one because the president is disobeying the law , is refusing all information to Congress , which means that -- I mean , when -- when he told the -- his nominee for the head of Homeland Security close the border and he said , well , that 's illegal , he said , do n't worry , I will protect you .

Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over an unredacted version of the special counsel \u2019 s report , along with the report \u2019 s underlying evidence . \u201c The administration has decided they are not going to honor their oath of office , \u201d she said . \u2026 But with Mr. Trump stonewalling Democrats and vowing to fight \u201c all the subpoenas , \u201d party leaders including Ms. Pelosi are increasingly casting the decision about impeachment in terms of the Constitution \u2019 s system of checks and balances \u2014 a message they believe voters can easily relate to . \u201c Will the administration violate the Constitution of the United States and not abide by the request of Congress in its legitimate oversight responsibility ? \u201d she asked , adding , \u201c Every day they are advertising their obstruction of justice by ignoring subpoenas and by just declaring that people shouldn \u2019 t come speak to Congress. \u201d [ The New York Times , 5/9/19 ]\nSen.

Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) in a May 12 interview on State of the Union whether she agreed with Nadler and Pelosi that America is \u201c in a constitutional crisis. \u201d She agreed , citing the Trump administration \u2019 s refusal to comply with congressional oversight :\nJAKE TAPPER ( ANCHOR ) : Do you agree ? Are we in a constitutional crisis ? SEN. KAMALA HARRIS ( D-CA ) : I think we probably are . I mean , listen , a constitutional crisis is defined as generally when the system that we set up with checks and balances , when each of the independent co-equal branches of the government fails to perform its duties . And I think that we are seeing a breakdown of responsibilities . We saw it last week in the Barr hearing . We 're seeing it in terms of a failure to compile its subpoenas . You know , now , being a member of the United States Congress in the Senate , I am seeing up close where the -- there is a failure to respect the significance of Congress ' duty to perform a role of oversight over the administration , over the agencies . I 'm seeing a failure to appreciate the importance of testifying before Congress in a way that is straightforward and truthful . So I think , yes , I think it is fair to say that we are looking at a crisis , not only of confidence , but potentially a constitutional crisis , yes . [ CNN , State of the Union , 5/12/19 ]\nMany experts say the Trump administration \u2019 s stonewalling of oversight constitutes or approaches a constitutional crisis ; others say that won \u2019 t be the case unless Trump refuses a court order\nUniversity of North Carolina law professor William Marshall : \u201c There \u2019 s nothing in history that comes even close to \u201d what Trump is doing . William Marshall , a University of North Carolina law professor , told The New York Times , \u201c There \u2019 s nothing in history that even comes close to \u201d Trump \u2019 s refusal to accept congressional oversight :\n\u201c A president who refuses to respond to congressional oversight is taking the presidency to new levels of danger , \u201d said William P. Marshall , a law professor at the University of North Carolina . \u201c We \u2019 re supposed to be in a system of checks and balances , and one of the biggest checks that Congress has over the executive is the power of congressional oversight. \u201d \u201c Not responding to that is to literally say that you \u2019 re above the law and you \u2019 re above the Constitution , \u201d he said . \u201c There \u2019 s nothing in history that comes even close to that. \u201d [ The New York Times , 5/7/19 ]\nStanford law professor David Alan Sklansky : \u201c There \u2019 s something different about \u201d Trump saying \u201c we \u2019 re not going to comply with subpoenas \u201d because they came from Democrats . Stanford law professor David Alan Sklansky said Trump \u2019 s refusal to cooperate with congressional probes goes far beyond from previous administrations \u2019 clashes with Congress on oversight . From The New York Times :\nDavid Alan Sklansky , a law professor at Stanford , said the nation is moving from the minor scuffles that gave rise to contempt citations against officials in the Bush and Obama administrations to a dangerous standoff . \u201c There \u2019 s something different about saying , across the board , that we \u2019 re not going to comply with subpoenas sent to us by a house of Congress controlled by Democrats because they \u2019 re the enemy and we \u2019 re just not going to do it , \u201d he said . \u201c Our system depends on some commitment by both parties and by all public officials to continuing a constitutional order. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s not a cliff that you fall off , and suddenly you \u2019 re in a constitutional crisis , \u201d Professor Sklansky said . \u201c It \u2019 s more like a slope , and how far down the slope you are. \u201d [ The New York Times , 5/7/19 ]\nFormer Congressional Research Service congressional oversight expert Morton Rosenberg : \u201c This is constitutional crisis time. \u201d Morton Rosenberg , formerly a congressional oversight expert with the Congressional Research Service and currently a fellow at the conservative Federalist Society , told the Washington Examiner that Trump \u2019 s blanket refusal to cooperate with congressional probes is \u201c constitutional crisis time \u201d :\nPresident Trump \u2019 s vow to fight \u201c all the subpoenas \u201d from House Democrats threatens a constitutional balance struck between the executive branch and Congress for the last 90 years . Legal experts from different political standpoints say that , by resisting congressional inquiries on flimsy grounds , Trump could prompt House Democrats to pursue impeachment in the near term and weaken the legal standing of the executive branch to resist future probes . \u201c This is constitutional crisis time . It truly is , \u201d said Morton Rosenberg , a former Congressional Research Service expert on congressional oversight matters and a fellow with the Federalist Society , a conservative-learning legal organization . Rosenberg and most other experts say that Trump \u2019 s arguments against several pending House Democratic inquiries lack merit and would be defeated in court . [ Washington Examiner , 4/26/19 ]\nPrinceton University history professor Julian E. Zelizer : \u201c I think we are looking at \u201d a constitutional crisis . Julian E. Zelizer , a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University , said Trump \u2019 s refusal to submit to congressional oversight , along with Senate Republicans \u2019 failure to hold him accountable , has led America to a constitutional crisis . From a May 9 Associated Press article :\nCongressional experts say a big risk is setting a precedent that goes way beyond Trump . What happens , for example , if an administration stonewalls Congress on information it wants for an investigation of air or water quality rules \u2014 or anything else ? Can the White House just say no ? \u201c We have a big problem , \u201d said Julian E. Zelizer , a Princeton University professor who studies history and public affairs . Trump 's new stance , at the end of the Mueller investigation , comes as the president faces a divided Congress for the first time . Democrats talked of being a check on him when they took control of the House in January , upsetting the calm he enjoyed during two years of friendlier relations with Republicans in charge of both chambers . Zelizer said with Trump \u201c aggressively flexing power to shut down oversight capacity of another branch , \u201d it 's \u201c unclear who and how this is resolved , especially with Senate Republicans standing by their man. \u201d Asked if this is a constitutional crisis , Zelizer said , \u201c I think we are looking at one. \u201d [ The Associated Press , 5/9/19 ]\nBoston College history professor Heather Richardson : \u201c We are in the worst crisis that American democracy has ever had. \u201d Heather Richardson , a history professor at Boston College , told the digital news outlet Quartz that American democracy is currently in its \u201c worst crisis \u201d ever , suggesting that the failure of Republicans to rein in Trump when they controlled Congress has made him think he can flout his constitutional role :\nThe US has entered a constitutional crisis , a growing number of historians and government officials say , as Trump and his administration defy protocol in new ways . \u201c We \u2019 ve talked about avoiding a Constitutional crisis . We are now in it , \u201d House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler said this afternoon , as the committee voted 24-16 to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress . \u201c We are in the worst crisis that American democracy has ever had , \u201d said Heather Richardson , a history professor at Boston College who traces the evolution of the Republican Party . Richardson contends that if the Republicans who controlled both houses of Congress for the first two years of Trump \u2019 s presidency had \u201c nipped in the bud \u201d his overreach in his first weeks in office , \u201c we would not be where we are. \u201d Instead , Trump spurned US allies , appeared to profit from the presidency , and gained more confidence in running the White House like his own private company . \u201c The problem with a leader like Trump is they can not stop , \u201d Richardson said . \u201c It is oxygen to them to keep pushing the limit . The only way he can feed not just his base but himself is to keep upping the ante. \u201d And Trump \u2019 s popularity among Republicans remains as strong as ever . [ Quartz , 5/8/19 ]\nAmerican Oversight chief counsel John E. Bies : If Trump \u2019 s actions are a deliberate strategy to resist all oversight , \u201c then the country is truly at an important constitutional moment \u201d that could become \u201c a reset of the constitutional system. \u201d John E. Bies of the nonprofit organization American Oversight wrote on the Lawfare blog that if Trump continues to stonewall congressional oversight , he will be putting enormous pressure on our system of checks and balances that could upend Congress \u2019 oversight role :\nIf the pattern of statements and actions by the executive branch over the past week is a harbinger of a sharp turn to such a maximalist resistance strategy , then the country is truly at an important constitutional moment that has the potential to shape the relationship between the branches in significant ways for the foreseeable future . In this sense , the decision to adopt a strategy of resisting oversight across the board would be a form of constitutional hardball . That is , it would be taking an uncompromising approach in the pursuit of partisan ends that may not violate express constitutional commands but certainly flouts long-standing conventions and norms about how constitutional processes should operate\u2014conventions and norms that officials have , in the past , regularly followed out of a sense of obligation . These tactics , then , are not just political hardball . Rather , as Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen describe it , such tactics \u201c put pressure on the \u2018 norms of good institutional citizenship \u2019 that help to structure and \u2018 sustain the constitutional system. \u2019 \u201d The adoption of constitutional hardball tactics places other constitutional actors in a difficult quandary . Actors on the receiving end are often confronted with a choice between two unappealing options : acquiesce , and accept the changes in the constitutional system wrought by the dissolution of the constitutional understandings and conventions that have been broken ; or escalate , and enter a high-stakes constitutional confrontation that may be politically unappealing . When the president is the one adopting a constitutional hardball tactic , there is an additional complication : Congress \u2019 s institutional interests may be at cross-purposes with the political interests of at least those members who share the same party as the president , which creates cross-pressures that can confound Congress \u2019 s ability to respond in an effective manner . This is the choice facing the House of Representatives\u2014and , more specifically , House Democrats\u2014if the administration has , indeed , adopted a strategy of resisting oversight across the board . To acquiesce to such resistance across the board would be to accept a fundamental reworking of the norms and conventions that structure interbranch interactions about oversight . These changes would effect a reset of the constitutional system that could be difficult to reverse in the future ( perhaps to the future chagrin of the Republican members who would have facilitated this shift ) . So Congress might be living with the precedents set this year for a long time . [ Lawfare , 4/27/19 ]\nTwo legal experts told Slate that the situation will fit the formal definition of a constitutional crisis if Trump refuses a court order to cooperate with congressional oversight . In a May 9 article , Slate asked multiple legal experts whether the Trump administration \u2019 s actions currently create a constitutional crisis . Fordham law professor Jed Shugerman said \u201c the key question to me is whether either party bypasses the courts or defies the courts , \u201d pointing to the Trump administration possibly \u201c ignoring a court order to turn over documents. \u201d Former Clinton administration acting solicitor general Walter Dellinger also said the key moment would be \u201c when a final court order is defied. \u201d But he said the Trump administration \u2019 s legal position is \u201c seriously weak. \u201d [ Slate , 5/9/19 ]\nConservative media have falsely claimed that Democrats are concerned only with the Mueller report , suggested that Trump \u2019 s tactics are normal , and mocked Democrats for speaking out about Trump \u2019 s obstruction\nFox \u2019 s Brian Kilmeade : \u201c So there are countless investigations . \u2026 And for the most part , the White House looked at all of this and said this is out of control. \u201d From the May 13 edition of Fox News \u2019 Fox & Friends :\nBRIAN KILMEADE ( CO-HOST ) : When we started this show , we were playing \u201c Panic at the Disco. \u201d We have a different kind of panic , it 's called a crisis , a constitutional crisis , that according to some Democrats , perhaps .

Listen to this . ... DOOCY : Well , you got to say this about the Democrats , they are good at talking points . And clearly , because with the Mueller investigation , they did not get the outcome that they wanted , which would be Donald Trump leaving the White House . They \u2019 ve been given this as the talking point because , I think , the average American is a little confused . They hear this stuff about well , you know , they want this unredacted copy of the Mueller report , to a lot of people that 's not a big deal . Just give them a copy .

The report was written for the attorney general by the special counsel . The attorney general decided to issue a four-page conclusion and offered skeptical Democrats a SCIF , a secure facility , to see the whole report . Not one Democrat wanted to see it . So Attorney General Barr was in the impossible position of violating federal law and releasing 6E jury testimony , or acquiescing to the demands of the radical looney left . Folks , the only constitutional crisis is the one created by Obama administration officials of a false Russia collusion , spun by that master of deceit himself , Jim Comey , the disgraced former head of the FBI .

I guess when Trump 's president , then it becomes a crisis . Ninety-eight percent of the Mueller report has been released . The 2 % that has n't been is grand jury testimony , and it 's against the law to release that . So Democrats are holding Barr in contempt for following the law . [ Fox News , Watters \u2019 World , 5/11/19 ]\nNY Post columnist David Harsanyi attacked Democrats for engaging in \u201c histrionics \u201d and pretending \u201c we are living through another Watergate. \u201d From a May 8 New York Post column by David Harsanyi :\nAfter a week of histrionics about Attorney General Bill Barr , who had offended Democrats and their media allies by writing a letter that accurately laid out the findings of the special counsel \u2019 s two-year investigation before releasing it , House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler began demanding the release of the unredacted report . The White House , as expected , \u00adasserted executive privilege . Though the law clearly places discretion over the redaction with the attorney general , Nadler claimed assertion had triggered a \u201c constitutional crisis. \u201d ... It \u2019 s all an act , of course , meant to create the perception that Barr , in cahoots with Trump , is hiding the findings of Mueller \u2019 s unimpeded and open-ended investigation . For Democrats , instigating a contempt vote over a lightly redacted report is the best way to pretend we are living through another Watergate . In the real world , the notion that a Trump antagonist like Mueller has buried vital evidence implicating the president in conspiracy or obstruction deep within the now-redacted sections of his report is dizzyingly silly . From the looks of it , Mueller spent more time describing Trumpian outbursts than looking for Russian interference . \u2026 There is a legitimate need for congressional oversight of the executive branch . For far too long , partisans have abdicated their constitutional duty . And when people like Nadler use that power as a political cudgel , they corrode the public \u2019 s trust .

Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over an unredacted version of the special counsel\u2019s report, along with the report\u2019s underlying evidence. \u201cThe administration has decided they are not going to honor their oath of office,\u201d she said. \u2026 But with Mr. Trump stonewalling Democrats and vowing to fight \u201call the subpoenas,\u201d party leaders including Ms. Pelosi are increasingly casting the decision about impeachment in terms of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances \u2014 a message they believe voters can easily relate to. \u201cWill the administration violate the Constitution of the United States and not abide by the request of Congress in its legitimate oversight responsibility?\u201d she asked, adding, \u201cEvery day they are advertising their obstruction of justice by ignoring subpoenas and by just declaring that people shouldn\u2019t come speak to Congress.\u201d [The New York Times, 5/9/19]\n\nSen. Kamala Harris: \u201cI think it is fair to say that we are looking at a crisis, not only of confidence, but potentially a constitutional crisis, yes.\u201d CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in a May 12 interview on State of the Union whether she agreed with Nadler and Pelosi that America is \u201cin a constitutional crisis.\u201d She agreed, citing the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional oversight:\n\nJAKE TAPPER (ANCHOR): Do you agree? Are we in a constitutional crisis? SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): I think we probably are. I mean, listen, a constitutional crisis is defined as generally when the system that we set up with checks and balances, when each of the independent co-equal branches of the government fails to perform its duties. And I think that we are seeing a breakdown of responsibilities. We saw it last week in the Barr hearing. We're seeing it in terms of a failure to compile its subpoenas. You know, now, being a member of the United States Congress in the Senate, I am seeing up close where the -- there is a failure to respect the significance of Congress' duty to perform a role of oversight over the administration, over the agencies. I'm seeing a failure to appreciate the importance of testifying before Congress in a way that is straightforward and truthful. So I think, yes, I think it is fair to say that we are looking at a crisis, not only of confidence, but potentially a constitutional crisis, yes. [CNN, State of the Union, 5/12/19]\n\nMany experts say the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling of oversight constitutes or approaches a constitutional crisis; others say that won\u2019t be the case unless Trump refuses a court order\n\nUniversity of North Carolina law professor William Marshall: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in history that comes even close to\u201d what Trump is doing. William Marshall, a University of North Carolina law professor, told The New York Times, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in history that even comes close to\u201d Trump\u2019s refusal to accept congressional oversight:\n\n\u201cA president who refuses to respond to congressional oversight is taking the presidency to new levels of danger,\u201d said William P. Marshall, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be in a system of checks and balances, and one of the biggest checks that Congress has over the executive is the power of congressional oversight.\u201d \u201cNot responding to that is to literally say that you\u2019re above the law and you\u2019re above the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in history that comes even close to that.\u201d [The New York Times, 5/7/19]\n\nStanford law professor David Alan Sklansky: \u201cThere\u2019s something different about\u201d Trump saying \u201cwe\u2019re not going to comply with subpoenas\u201d because they came from Democrats. Stanford law professor David Alan Sklansky said Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with congressional probes goes far beyond from previous administrations\u2019 clashes with Congress on oversight. From The New York Times:\n\nDavid Alan Sklansky, a law professor at Stanford, said the nation is moving from the minor scuffles that gave rise to contempt citations against officials in the Bush and Obama administrations to a dangerous standoff. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about saying, across the board, that we\u2019re not going to comply with subpoenas sent to us by a house of Congress controlled by Democrats because they\u2019re the enemy and we\u2019re just not going to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur system depends on some commitment by both parties and by all public officials to continuing a constitutional order.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a cliff that you fall off, and suddenly you\u2019re in a constitutional crisis,\u201d Professor Sklansky said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a slope, and how far down the slope you are.\u201d [The New York Times, 5/7/19]\n\nFormer Congressional Research Service congressional oversight expert Morton Rosenberg: \u201cThis is constitutional crisis time.\u201d Morton Rosenberg, formerly a congressional oversight expert with the Congressional Research Service and currently a fellow at the conservative Federalist Society, told the Washington Examiner that Trump\u2019s blanket refusal to cooperate with congressional probes is \u201cconstitutional crisis time\u201d:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s vow to fight \u201call the subpoenas\u201d from House Democrats threatens a constitutional balance struck between the executive branch and Congress for the last 90 years. Legal experts from different political standpoints say that, by resisting congressional inquiries on flimsy grounds, Trump could prompt House Democrats to pursue impeachment in the near term and weaken the legal standing of the executive branch to resist future probes. \u201cThis is constitutional crisis time. It truly is,\u201d said Morton Rosenberg, a former Congressional Research Service expert on congressional oversight matters and a fellow with the Federalist Society, a conservative-learning legal organization. Rosenberg and most other experts say that Trump\u2019s arguments against several pending House Democratic inquiries lack merit and would be defeated in court. [Washington Examiner, 4/26/19]\n\nPrinceton University history professor Julian E. Zelizer: \u201cI think we are looking at\u201d a constitutional crisis. Julian E. Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, said Trump\u2019s refusal to submit to congressional oversight, along with Senate Republicans\u2019 failure to hold him accountable, has led America to a constitutional crisis. From a May 9 Associated Press article:\n\nCongressional experts say a big risk is setting a precedent that goes way beyond Trump. What happens, for example, if an administration stonewalls Congress on information it wants for an investigation of air or water quality rules \u2014 or anything else? Can the White House just say no? \u201cWe have a big problem,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a Princeton University professor who studies history and public affairs. Trump's new stance, at the end of the Mueller investigation, comes as the president faces a divided Congress for the first time. Democrats talked of being a check on him when they took control of the House in January, upsetting the calm he enjoyed during two years of friendlier relations with Republicans in charge of both chambers. Zelizer said with Trump \u201caggressively flexing power to shut down oversight capacity of another branch,\u201d it's \u201cunclear who and how this is resolved, especially with Senate Republicans standing by their man.\u201d Asked if this is a constitutional crisis, Zelizer said, \u201cI think we are looking at one.\u201d [The Associated Press, 5/9/19]\n\nBoston College history professor Heather Richardson: \u201cWe are in the worst crisis that American democracy has ever had.\u201d Heather Richardson, a history professor at Boston College, told the digital news outlet Quartz that American democracy is currently in its \u201cworst crisis\u201d ever, suggesting that the failure of Republicans to rein in Trump when they controlled Congress has made him think he can flout his constitutional role:\n\nThe US has entered a constitutional crisis, a growing number of historians and government officials say, as Trump and his administration defy protocol in new ways. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about avoiding a Constitutional crisis. We are now in it,\u201d House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler said this afternoon, as the committee voted 24-16 to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress. \u201cWe are in the worst crisis that American democracy has ever had,\u201d said Heather Richardson, a history professor at Boston College who traces the evolution of the Republican Party. Richardson contends that if the Republicans who controlled both houses of Congress for the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency had \u201cnipped in the bud\u201d his overreach in his first weeks in office, \u201cwe would not be where we are.\u201d Instead, Trump spurned US allies, appeared to profit from the presidency, and gained more confidence in running the White House like his own private company. \u201cThe problem with a leader like Trump is they cannot stop,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt is oxygen to them to keep pushing the limit. The only way he can feed not just his base but himself is to keep upping the ante.\u201d And Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans remains as strong as ever. [Quartz, 5/8/19]\n\nAmerican Oversight chief counsel John E. Bies: If Trump\u2019s actions are a deliberate strategy to resist all oversight, \u201cthen the country is truly at an important constitutional moment\u201d that could become \u201ca reset of the constitutional system.\u201d John E. Bies of the nonprofit organization American Oversight wrote on the Lawfare blog that if Trump continues to stonewall congressional oversight, he will be putting enormous pressure on our system of checks and balances that could upend Congress\u2019 oversight role:\n\nIf the pattern of statements and actions by the executive branch over the past week is a harbinger of a sharp turn to such a maximalist resistance strategy, then the country is truly at an important constitutional moment that has the potential to shape the relationship between the branches in significant ways for the foreseeable future. In this sense, the decision to adopt a strategy of resisting oversight across the board would be a form of constitutional hardball. That is, it would be taking an uncompromising approach in the pursuit of partisan ends that may not violate express constitutional commands but certainly flouts long-standing conventions and norms about how constitutional processes should operate\u2014conventions and norms that officials have, in the past, regularly followed out of a sense of obligation. These tactics, then, are not just political hardball. Rather, as Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen describe it, such tactics \u201cput pressure on the \u2018norms of good institutional citizenship\u2019 that help to structure and \u2018sustain the constitutional system.\u2019\u201d The adoption of constitutional hardball tactics places other constitutional actors in a difficult quandary. Actors on the receiving end are often confronted with a choice between two unappealing options: acquiesce, and accept the changes in the constitutional system wrought by the dissolution of the constitutional understandings and conventions that have been broken; or escalate, and enter a high-stakes constitutional confrontation that may be politically unappealing. When the president is the one adopting a constitutional hardball tactic, there is an additional complication: Congress\u2019s institutional interests may be at cross-purposes with the political interests of at least those members who share the same party as the president, which creates cross-pressures that can confound Congress\u2019s ability to respond in an effective manner. This is the choice facing the House of Representatives\u2014and, more specifically, House Democrats\u2014if the administration has, indeed, adopted a strategy of resisting oversight across the board. To acquiesce to such resistance across the board would be to accept a fundamental reworking of the norms and conventions that structure interbranch interactions about oversight. These changes would effect a reset of the constitutional system that could be difficult to reverse in the future (perhaps to the future chagrin of the Republican members who would have facilitated this shift). So Congress might be living with the precedents set this year for a long time. [Lawfare, 4/27/19]\n\nTwo legal experts told Slate that the situation will fit the formal definition of a constitutional crisis if Trump refuses a court order to cooperate with congressional oversight. In a May 9 article, Slate asked multiple legal experts whether the Trump administration\u2019s actions currently create a constitutional crisis. Fordham law professor Jed Shugerman said \u201cthe key question to me is whether either party bypasses the courts or defies the courts,\u201d pointing to the Trump administration possibly \u201cignoring a court order to turn over documents.\u201d Former Clinton administration acting solicitor general Walter Dellinger also said the key moment would be \u201cwhen a final court order is defied.\u201d But he said the Trump administration\u2019s legal position is \u201cseriously weak.\u201d [Slate, 5/9/19]\n\nConservative media have falsely claimed that Democrats are concerned only with the Mueller report, suggested that Trump\u2019s tactics are normal, and mocked Democrats for speaking out about Trump\u2019s obstruction\n\nFox\u2019s Brian Kilmeade: \u201cSo there are countless investigations. \u2026 And for the most part, the White House looked at all of this and said this is out of control.\u201d From the May 13 edition of Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends:\n\nBRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): When we started this show, we were playing \u201cPanic at the Disco.\u201d We have a different kind of panic, it's called a crisis, a constitutional crisis, that according to some Democrats, perhaps.

Which gets to the definition, what the heck are you doing? You\u2019ve got an immigration catastrophe. You got major flashpoints in North Korea, Iran, a trade deal that's blowing up with China. You have so many domestic issues to address, and you\u2019re focusing on Donald Trump's casino purchases?

Contrary to Doocy\u2019s claim, there are various legal avenues for Congress to receive the Mueller report. From the May 13 edition of Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends:\n\nEARHARDT: Last week Jerry Nadler voted, had his committee vote, to hold Bill Barr in contempt. We kept hearing him say last week, \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d Nancy Pelosi agreed with him, continued to use that phrase, \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d And the Democrats continued to use it through the weekend as well. Listen to this. ... DOOCY: Well, you got to say this about the Democrats, they are good at talking points. And clearly, because with the Mueller investigation, they did not get the outcome that they wanted, which would be Donald Trump leaving the White House. They\u2019ve been given this as the talking point because, I think, the average American is a little confused. They hear this stuff about well, you know, they want this unredacted copy of the Mueller report, to a lot of people that's not a big deal. Just give them a copy.

How? Because they can't get the full Mueller report? Are they all stupid? They have 98% of the full report. And I\u2019ve got news for you bozos: You weren't even entitled to any of it. The report was written for the attorney general by the special counsel. The attorney general decided to issue a four-page conclusion and offered skeptical Democrats a SCIF, a secure facility, to see the whole report. Not one Democrat wanted to see it. So Attorney General Barr was in the impossible position of violating federal law and releasing 6E jury testimony, or acquiescing to the demands of the radical looney left. Folks, the only constitutional crisis is the one created by Obama administration officials of a false Russia collusion, spun by that master of deceit himself, Jim Comey, the disgraced former head of the FBI.

I guess when Trump's president, then it becomes a crisis. Ninety-eight percent of the Mueller report has been released. The 2% that hasn't been is grand jury testimony, and it's against the law to release that. So Democrats are holding Barr in contempt for following the law. [Fox News, Watters\u2019 World, 5/11/19]\n\nNY Post columnist David Harsanyi attacked Democrats for engaging in \u201chistrionics\u201d and pretending \u201cwe are living through another Watergate.\u201d From a May 8 New York Post column by David Harsanyi:\n\nAfter a week of histrionics about Attorney General Bill Barr, who had offended Democrats and their media allies by writing a letter that accurately laid out the findings of the special counsel\u2019s two-year investigation before releasing it, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler began demanding the release of the unredacted report. The White House, as expected, \u00adasserted executive privilege. Though the law clearly places discretion over the redaction with the attorney general, Nadler claimed assertion had triggered a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d ... It\u2019s all an act, of course, meant to create the perception that Barr, in cahoots with Trump, is hiding the findings of Mueller\u2019s unimpeded and open-ended investigation. For Democrats, instigating a contempt vote over a lightly redacted report is the best way to pretend we are living through another Watergate. In the real world, the notion that a Trump antagonist like Mueller has buried vital evidence implicating the president in conspiracy or obstruction deep within the now-redacted sections of his report is dizzyingly silly. From the looks of it, Mueller spent more time describing Trumpian outbursts than looking for Russian interference. \u2026 There is a legitimate need for congressional oversight of the executive branch. For far too long, partisans have abdicated their constitutional duty. And when people like Nadler use that power as a political cudgel, they corrode the public\u2019s trust.
