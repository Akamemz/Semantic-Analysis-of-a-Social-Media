    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court has denied a petition by Planned Parenthood to review an Arkansas statute requiring a provider of abortion-inducing drugs to have a contractual relationship with a doctor who has admitting privileges at a hospital . The point of the law is to assure that , if a patient has an adverse reaction to some abortifacient , there will be a physician and a hospital available to provide appropriate medical treatment .\nNo doctor was crazy enough to clean up behind Planned Parenthood , however , so the abortion mill sued . A district court did enjoin the statute , but that injunction was vacated by the 8th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals . Inevitably , SCOTUS found Planned Parenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma v. Jegley lying on its doorstep . But the justices declined to take this legal orphan in , rejecting it without comment .\nThat may be a harbinger of worse things to come for the abortion industry . The Court is expected to rule soon on a high profile case whereby the petitioners have challenged a California law that requires crisis pregnancy centers to post information about the availability of free abortions . The basic mission of the centers is to discourage abortions , so they believe the law violates their First Amendment free speech rights .\nThe abortion industry is engaged in an ongoing propaganda campaign against these enterprises , labeling them fake women \u2019 s health centers , \u201c run by anti-abortion , often religious organizations , that target pregnant women. \u201d It isn \u2019 t exactly clear why it \u2019 s so sinister for a pregnancy crisis center to focus on pregnant women .

So , when the crisis pregnancy centers started popping up in the Golden State , the abortion lobbyists went to work . The result was the Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act , or the Reproductive FACT Act . Lea Patterson and Joseph Bingham provide this description of the law in the Hill :\nThe so-called \u201c Reproductive FACT Act \u201d requires pregnancy care centers providing licensed medical services to post prominent advertisements for state-subsidized abortion in their waiting rooms or directly to patients.\u2026 Even non-medical pregnancy care centers \u2014 the ones focused on clothing , feeding , and diapering newborns \u2014 are compelled to convey the government \u2019 s message , or refrain from advertising .\nThis is \u201c compelled speech \u201d and , as Patterson and Bingham point out , it is just as impermissible under the First Amendment as censored speech .
