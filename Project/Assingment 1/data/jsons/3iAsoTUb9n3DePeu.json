The question is whether government needs to do something about this\u2014or whether government needs to undo many things .\nMeasuring income inequality is no simple thing , which is one source of disagreement between those who think inequality is a problem and those who think it is n't . But it is possible to cut through the underbrush and make some points clear .\nWe can identify two kinds of economic inequality , and let 's keep this in mind as we contemplate what , if anything , government ought to do .\nThe first kind we might call market inequality . Individuals differ in many ways , including energy , ambition , and ingenuity . As a result , in a market-oriented economy some people will be better than others at satisfying consumers and will hence tend to make more money . The only way to prevent that is to interfere forcibly with the results of peaceful , positive-sum transactions in the marketplace . Since interference discourages the production of wealth , the equality fostered through violence will be an equality of impoverishment .\nIs it better that people be equally poor or unequally affluent ? This is the important question that political philosopher John Tomasi , author of Free Market Fairness , puts to his classes at Brown University . Would they prefer a society in which everyone has the same low income , or one in which incomes vary , perhaps widely , but the lowest incomes are higher than the equal income of the first society ?\nWhich would you choose ? Let 's remember that it is entirely possible for the poorest in a society to become richer even as the gap between the richest and poorest grows . Imagine an accordion-like elevator that is rising as a whole while being stretched out , putting the floor further from the ceiling . Would such a society be objectionable ? Why is the relative position of the poorest more important than their absolute position ? Is concern about relative positions nothing more than envy ?\nWe could argue about that all day , but a much more urgent subject is political-economic inequality . This is the inequality fostered through the political system . Since government 's distinctive feature is its claimed authority to use force aggressively ( as opposed to defensively ) , this second sort of inequality is produced by violence , which on its face should make it abhorrent .\nPolitical-economic systems throughout the world , including ones typically thought to be market-oriented ( or `` capitalist '' ) , such as in the United States , are in fact built on deeply rooted and long-established systems of privilege .
