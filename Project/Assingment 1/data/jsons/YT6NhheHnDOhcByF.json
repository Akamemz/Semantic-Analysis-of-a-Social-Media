    "content": "In a development that incited more opposition in Congress to the Obama administration \u2019 s nuclear deal , the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has given Iran the rare benefit of using its own analysts to inspect a site where it is suspected of working on atomic weapons .\nThe Associated Press reported Wednesday that the condition is part of a secret bilateral agreement between Iran and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency . Inspections of Iran \u2019 s closely guarded Parchin nuclear site will be ceded to the Iranians as part of the overarching deal reached by the U.S. and five other world powers in Vienna in July , the AP reported .\nThe side agreement , worked out between the IAEA and Iran , allows Tehran to employ its own analysts and equipment to search for evidence of activities that it has consistently denied \u2014 that it has been trying secretly to develop nuclear weapons .\nReaction in Congress was swift . House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , California Republican , said it was unbelievable that the U.S. would \u201c allow Iran to police these sites themselves \u201d after Tehran denied the existence of a nuclear weapons program for years .\n\u201c This is a very serious development and should concern every member of Congress who supports or is thinking about supporting this deal , \u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement . \u201c President Obama said that this deal is \u2018 not built on trust , \u2019 but on verification . This side agreement shows that true verification is a sham , and it begs the question of what else the administration is keeping from Congress . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the administration has some explaining to do .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s briefings on these side deals have been totally insufficient \u2014 and it still isn \u2019 t clear whether anyone at the White House has seen the final documents , \u201d Mr. Boehner said . \u201c Why should Iran be trusted to carry out its own nuclear inspections at a military site it tried to hide from the world ? \u201d\nOn the other side of Capitol Hill , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker , Tennessee Republican , said , \u201c This type of unorthodox agreement has never been done before by the IAEA and speaks to the great lengths our negotiators took to accommodate the ayatollah despite repeated assurances from the administration that this deal is not based on trust . \u201d\nThe White House wouldn \u2019 t comment on details of the side deal but said it is confident of the IAEA \u2019 s ability to monitor Iran .\n\u201c We are confident in the agency \u2019 s technical plans for investigating the possible military dimensions of Iran \u2019 s former program , issues that in some cases date back more than a decade , \u201d said National Security Council spokesman Ned Price . \u201c Just as importantly , the IAEA is comfortable with arrangements , which are unique to the agency \u2019 s investigation of Iran \u2019 s historical activities . \u201d\nMr. Price said the IAEA has developed \u201c the most robust inspection regime ever peacefully negotiated to ensure Iran \u2019 s current program remains exclusively peaceful , \u201d which he called \u201c the overarching objective \u201d of the nuclear deal .\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. negotiators had seen the IAEA \u2019 s confidential bilateral inspection agreement with Congress and briefed lawmakers about it in classified meetings .\nOlli Heinonen , who was in charge of the Iran probe as deputy IAEA director general from 2005 to 2010 and opposes the Iran deal , said he could think of no instance in which a country was allowed to perform its own investigation .\nIran has refused access to Parchin for years and has denied any interest in \u2014 or work on \u2014 nuclear weapons . Based on U.S. , Israeli and other intelligence and its own research , the IAEA suspects that the Islamic republic may have experimented with highly explosive detonators for nuclear arms at that military facility and other weapons-related work elsewhere .\nThe IAEA has repeatedly cited evidence , based on satellite images , of apparent attempts to sanitize the site since activity stopped more than a decade ago .\nThe document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn \u2019 t differ substantially from the final version . He demanded anonymity because he isn \u2019 t authorized to discuss the issue .\nIt is labeled \u201c separate arrangement II , \u201d indicating that Iran and the IAEA have another confidential agreement governing the agency \u2019 s investigation of the nuclear weapons accusations .\nThe document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe , IAEA staff will be reduced to monitoring Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin site .\nIran will provide agency specialists with photos and videos of locations that the IAEA says are linked to the suspected weapons work , \u201c taking into account military concerns . \u201d\nThat wording suggests that \u2014 beyond being barred from physically visiting the site \u2014 the agency won \u2019 t even get photo or video information from areas that Iran says are off limits because they have military significance .\nMr. Obama and his top advisers have denied there was a \u201c secret \u201d side agreement , saying the IAEA routinely establishes its own deals with countries undergoing such inspections . Secretary of State John F. Kerry has said the Parchin document is like other routine arrangements between the agency and individual IAEA member nations .\nBut as lawmakers pressed for more information , administration officials have said they don \u2019 t have the text of the side agreement and could offer an outline of it only in closed-door briefings . IAEA chief Yukiya Amano told Republican senators in a secret briefing last week that he is obligated to keep the document confidential .\nIAEA inspectors would normally take environmental samples for evidence of any weapons development work , but the agreement stipulates that Iranian technicians will do the sampling .\nInspectors are limited to seven samples inside the building where the experiments are believed to have taken place . Additional samples will be allowed only outside of the Parchin site , in an area still to be determined .\n\u201c Activities will be carried out using Iran \u2019 s authenticated equipment consistent with technical specifications provided by the agency , \u201d the agreement says . Although the document says the IAEA \u201c will ensure the technical authenticity \u201d of Iran \u2019 s inspection , it does not say how .\nThe draft is unsigned , but the signatory for Iran is listed as Ali Hoseini Tash , deputy secretary of the Supreme National Security Council for Strategic Affairs , instead of an official of Iran \u2019 s nuclear agency . That reflects the significance Tehran attaches to the agreement .\nCongress will vote next month on a resolution of disapproval of the nuclear deal , which would limit Iran \u2019 s atomic program in return for lifting international economic sanctions . Congressional Republicans , some Democrats and Israel are criticizing the deal , saying it won \u2019 t stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon and will give the country more cash to sponsor terrorist acts in the region .\nCritics also say Iran , under the accord , was allowed to keep its nuclear research , personnel and production facilities in place and that international inspections will not be able to detect violations .\nMr. McCarthy said the revelation about Parchin justifies lawmakers \u2019 concerns about the deal .\n\u201c For weeks , my colleagues and I have demanded to know the details of these secret side agreements , \u201d he said . \u201c It is absolutely unacceptable , yet telling , that we are finding out the details of these agreements through The Associated Press . \u201d\nIf the resolution passes and Mr. Obama vetoes it as promised , opponents will need a two-thirds majority to override the veto , including a sizable number of Democratic defections in both chambers .
