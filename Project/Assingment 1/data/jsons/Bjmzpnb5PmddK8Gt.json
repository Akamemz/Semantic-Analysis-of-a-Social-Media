    "content": "Ezra Klein , the editor-at-large at Vox and the host of The Ezra Klein Show podcast , has a new book out called Why We \u2019 re Polarized . He agreed to chat with us about the book \u2019 s arguments and the role that technology plays in it .\nNicholas Thompson : Welcome , Ezra ! The book is marvelous . I read the galleys pretty much cover to cover and was captivated . You take readers through American history and explain persuasively that we \u2019 re vastly more polarized now than in the past . And your publisher craftily timed your release exactly to the impeachment hearings , which were perhaps the most partisan moment in history .\nNT : When I started , I expected to find a chapter on filter bubbles and Facebook . Or about how Twitter pushes political conversations to extremes . Or how YouTube takes people from cookie-baking tips to jihadism . There are a few bits about tech , many of which are intriguing . But why don \u2019 t we start with this : Explain your general thesis and why the social platforms play a relatively small role in it .\nEK : In a way , these answers are the same . The core story of the book is that over the past 50 years , the country \u2019 s dominant political coalitions have sorted by ideology , race , religion , geography , psychology , consumer behavior , and cultural preferences . This has , in turn , kicked off a series of feedback loops in which political institutions ( the media , Congress ) and actors ( candidates , individual journalists ) adopt more polarized strategies to both respond and appeal to a more polarized audience , which further polarizes the audience , which further polarizes the institutions , which further polarizes the audience , and so on .\nSocial media is one of those institutions , and in my view , is clearly a polarization accelerant . In the coming years it may prove a primary driver . But the bulk of the run-up in American party polarization predates social media , which means social media isn \u2019 t core to the story .\nNT : That makes sense . Both things can be true : Technology can be polarizing us but also be a relatively small part of why we \u2019 re polarized . And the feedback loop you describe is one of the things I fear for the most when I think about the press . A newspaper that is relentlessly critical of Trump will have Facebook and Twitter accounts likely to primarily attract critics of Trump , which means that stories critical of Trump will get extra page views , which creates incentives to do more of the same . Or the trend can work in the opposite direction , with stories praising Trump . Our industry is governed by all kinds of incentives and norms . But I do worry about this kind of baleful feedback loop .\nEK : There are two basic problems caused by this kind of polarization . One is everyone is constantly angry and agitated , and politics becomes something only those with a high taste for constant conflict can stomach . But the bigger problem is how polarization interacts with our political institutions , which require high levels of compromise to function . My concern isn \u2019 t that politics is argumentative or uncivil or divided . It \u2019 s that we are trapped in arguments we can not resolve , because in our political system , winning an election rarely gives you the power to actually govern . In our political system , bipartisanship is necessary . With parties this polarized , bipartisanship , as I show in the book , is irrational for the out-of-power party to offer . So what we \u2019 ve done , in effect , is escalated the intensity of our political fights , but made it almost impossible for one side or the other to win , at least in terms of policymaking .
