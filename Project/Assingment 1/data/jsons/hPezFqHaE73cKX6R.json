The work ahead will be hard . These times demand the best of us -- all of us , but we can do this . Together , we can do this . ''\nRyan 's speech was part of a campaign effort to portray Romney , a multimillionaire businessman and former Massachusetts governor , as a champion of working-class Americans who struggle under the policies of President Barack Obama .\nRomney chose Ryan , the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin , as his running mate in hopes that the fiscal expert known for big and hard-line ideas would galvanize support on the political right and appeal to moderates and independents seeking solutions for the nation 's chronic deficit and debt problems .\nRyan 's speech delivered a fiery attack on Obama 's record and highlighted the GOP allegiance to founding principles as he decried a dearth of leadership and pledged results in keeping with the convention theme for the day : `` We Can Change It . ''\n`` I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us , with opportunity for the young and security for the old -- and I know that we are ready , '' Ryan said . `` Our nominee is sure ready . His whole life has prepared him for this moment -- to meet serious challenges in a serious way , without excuses and idle words .

''\nRyan focused mostly on the fiscal issues that are the congressman 's strength , such as the national debt , stimulus spending under Obama and his proposed Medicare reforms , which have come under attack by Obama and Democrats .\nHe sought to turn the tables on the issue , repeating the factually challenged assertion that Obama cut Medicare by more than $ 700 billion to cover the costs of the 2010 health care reform law passed by Democrats .\nThe figure comes from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report that said repealing the health care law , as called for by Romney and Ryan , would increase spending on Medicare by $ 716 billion through 2022 . At the same time , the CBO letter said keeping Obamacare in place would not mean a $ 716 billion decrease in Medicare spending , as claimed by Ryan .\n`` The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over , '' Ryan said . `` That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare .

Isaac prompted Republican organizers to postpone the first day of the convention , which is crucial for defining Romney to the American people .\nRomney mentioned Isaac at a campaign event on Wednesday in Indiana , joking that he appreciated the chance to be there `` on dry land . ''\n`` Our thoughts are , of course , with the people of the Gulf Coast states , '' he said , noting the Katrina anniversary . `` We 're grateful that it appears that Isaac will spare them from the kind of damage we saw during Katrina , but for many in the Gulf Coast who just finished repairing their homes and getting their lives back to normal , this must be a heavy burden . And so today our thoughts are with them , our prayers go out to them and our country must do all we can to help them recover . ''\nGOP officials pushed ahead with a convention agenda designed to frame the election as a referendum on Obama 's presidency while attempting to turn Romney 's biggest political vulnerabilities into campaign advantages .\nRomney clinched the Republican nomination in the roll call of state delegates Tuesday after a rugged Republican primary campaign that saw momentum swings nearly every week and bitter attacks by GOP colleagues\nThe 2,200-plus convention delegates also approved a conservative platform that calls for less government , opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a `` human life amendment '' to ban abortion , with no specific exceptions for cases of rape , incest or when the mother 's life is threatened .\nRomney and Ryan , who also was endorsed by delegates Tuesday , will be formally nominated on Thursday , and Romney 's acceptance speech that night will conclude the convention with the highest-profile political moment in the former Massachusetts governor 's career .\nThe convention seeks to portray Obama as a failed leader whose policies undermine the American dream , directly attacking the president on the issue of equal opportunity that traditionally favors Democrats .\nSpeaker after speaker has emphasized his or her own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts . Virtually every speaker took umbrage with Obama 's comment on the campaign trail that `` you did n't build that '' in reference to successful businesses that received government help along the way .\nOn Tuesday night , Romney 's wife Ann faced a similar entry as Ryan into the full-bore glare of presidential media coverage with her own prime time speech that delivered a political broadside with a personal touch .\nShe mixed homespun anecdotes , such as repeated references to their first date , with references to issues considered weaknesses for her husband -- support from women and his personal wealth -- in encouraging Americans to get to know the warm and loving man she met at a high school dance .\n`` This was a political speech wrapped in velvet , '' CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger commented .\nAnn Romney took on another tricky political issue for her husband Wednesday when she addressed a Latino coalition and challenged the traditional support by Hispanic-Americans for Democrats , including Obama .\n`` I feel like my importance in speaking out is making sure that those coalitions that would naturally be voting for another party wake up and say you better really look at the issues this time , '' she said . `` You better really look at your future and say who is going to be the guy who is going to make it better for you and your children . And there is only one answer . ''\nMeanwhile , Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called Wednesday for a more comprehensive and moderate immigration policy by Republicans in order to make inroads with the Latino community .\n`` The Republican Party has to become the pro-legal immigration party , not simply the anti-illegal immigration party , and that begins by recognizing that a million people a year immigrate to the United States legally , permanently . No other country even comes close , '' said Rubio , a Hispanic-American conservative who is a rising Republican star .\nNoting that millions of illegal immigrants present what he called a humanitarian problem , he added : `` We are not going to give amnesty to 12 million people , we are not going to round up and deport 12 million people . Somewhere between those two ideas there is a solution . ''\nThe GOP platform contains traditional conservative planks on immigration and other issues , including support for the `` human life amendment '' with no exceptions to an abortion ban . That runs counter to overall public opinion in America , especially among women .\nObama took aim at conservative GOP social policies Wednesday , saying voters can decide the direction of the country .\n`` In November you can say in this century women can be trusted to make their own health care choices , '' the president said to cheers . `` You can say that in this century we do n't think young immigrants who were brought here when they were children and understand themselves as Americans and have pledged allegiance to the flag should suddenly be deported to countries where they have never been . ''\nThe Obama campaign also has made an issue of Romney 's personal wealth , challenging him to release more than the two years of tax returns he has made public -- as his father did in releasing 12 years of returns when running for president in 1968 -- and questioning whether his career as a venture capitalist benefited workers or prepared him to deal with a sluggish economy .\nIn her speech Tuesday night , Ann Romney addressed the Democratic attacks head-on , noting her husband 's success throughout his career and expressing amazement that such a record was being criticized .\n`` If the last four years had been more successful , do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt 's success ? '' she said .\nFor Romney , 65 , the nomination puts him within one step of the goal he first sought in 2007 by running for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts .\nThough rivals challenged his conservative credentials in the 2012 primaries , Romney emerged victorious . But he continues to walk a political tightrope in trying to energize right-wing support while also appealing to moderates and independent voters .\nThe latest CNN/ORC International Poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama , with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53 % of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs , compared with 39 % for Romney .\nObama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class , and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today , with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney .\nRomney leads 48 % to 44 % over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation 's problems . Both figures are within the survey 's margin of error .",

And so today our thoughts are with them, our prayers go out to them and our country must do all we can to help them recover.\"\n\nGOP officials pushed ahead with a convention agenda designed to frame the election as a referendum on Obama's presidency while attempting to turn Romney's biggest political vulnerabilities into campaign advantages.\n\nRomney clinched the Republican nomination in the roll call of state delegates Tuesday after a rugged Republican primary campaign that saw momentum swings nearly every week and bitter attacks by GOP colleagues\n\nThe 2,200-plus convention delegates also approved a conservative platform that calls for less government, opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a \"human life amendment\" to ban abortion, with no specific exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened.\n\nRomney and Ryan, who also was endorsed by delegates Tuesday, will be formally nominated on Thursday, and Romney's acceptance speech that night will conclude the convention with the highest-profile political moment in the former Massachusetts governor's career.\n\nThe convention seeks to portray Obama as a failed leader whose policies undermine the American dream, directly attacking the president on the issue of equal opportunity that traditionally favors Democrats.\n\nSpeaker after speaker has emphasized his or her own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts. Virtually every speaker took umbrage with Obama's comment on the campaign trail that \"you didn't build that\" in reference to successful businesses that received government help along the way.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Romney's wife Ann faced a similar entry as Ryan into the full-bore glare of presidential media coverage with her own prime time speech that delivered a political broadside with a personal touch.\n\nShe mixed homespun anecdotes, such as repeated references to their first date, with references to issues considered weaknesses for her husband -- support from women and his personal wealth -- in encouraging Americans to get to know the warm and loving man she met at a high school dance.\n\n\"This was a political speech wrapped in velvet,\" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger commented.\n\nAnn Romney took on another tricky political issue for her husband Wednesday when she addressed a Latino coalition and challenged the traditional support by Hispanic-Americans for Democrats, including Obama.\n\n\"I feel like my importance in speaking out is making sure that those coalitions that would naturally be voting for another party wake up and say you better really look at the issues this time,\" she said. \"You better really look at your future and say who is going to be the guy who is going to make it better for you and your children. And there is only one answer.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called Wednesday for a more comprehensive and moderate immigration policy by Republicans in order to make inroads with the Latino community.\n\n\"The Republican Party has to become the pro-legal immigration party, not simply the anti-illegal immigration party, and that begins by recognizing that a million people a year immigrate to the United States legally, permanently. No other country even comes close,\" said Rubio, a Hispanic-American conservative who is a rising Republican star.\n\nNoting that millions of illegal immigrants present what he called a humanitarian problem, he added: \"We are not going to give amnesty to 12 million people, we are not going to round up and deport 12 million people. Somewhere between those two ideas there is a solution.\"\n\nThe GOP platform contains traditional conservative planks on immigration and other issues, including support for the \"human life amendment\" with no exceptions to an abortion ban. That runs counter to overall public opinion in America, especially among women.\n\nObama took aim at conservative GOP social policies Wednesday, saying voters can decide the direction of the country.\n\n\"In November you can say in this century women can be trusted to make their own health care choices,\" the president said to cheers. \"You can say that in this century we don't think young immigrants who were brought here when they were children and understand themselves as Americans and have pledged allegiance to the flag should suddenly be deported to countries where they have never been.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign also has made an issue of Romney's personal wealth, challenging him to release more than the two years of tax returns he has made public -- as his father did in releasing 12 years of returns when running for president in 1968 -- and questioning whether his career as a venture capitalist benefited workers or prepared him to deal with a sluggish economy.\n\nIn her speech Tuesday night, Ann Romney addressed the Democratic attacks head-on, noting her husband's success throughout his career and expressing amazement that such a record was being criticized.\n\n\"If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt's success?\" she said.\n\nFor Romney, 65, the nomination puts him within one step of the goal he first sought in 2007 by running for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts.\n\nThough rivals challenged his conservative credentials in the 2012 primaries, Romney emerged victorious. But he continues to walk a political tightrope in trying to energize right-wing support while also appealing to moderates and independent voters.\n\nThe latest CNN/ORC International Poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53% of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs, compared with 39% for Romney.\n\nObama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney.\n\nRomney leads 48% to 44% over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation's problems. Both figures are within the survey's margin of error.",
