Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country . \u201d\nBut the bleak picture he painted often did not line up with the facts , using over-inflated statistics and questionable generalizations when discussing matters of crime , justice , immigration , and national security .\nTrump said that homicides increased by 17 percent from last year in the country \u2019 s 50 largest cities . He did not say , however , that the national homicide rate hit a four-decade low last year , according to the FBI\u2014or that the number of people murdered in the 50 largest cities has declined by half since 1991 .\nIn an interview on CNN ahead of the speech , Trump \u2019 s campaign chairman Paul Manafort defended the remarks by casting doubt on the FBI \u2019 s official crime numbers , which include information gleaned from local police departments .\n\u201c The FBI is certainly suspect these days after what they just did with Hillary Clinton , \u201d Manafort said , referring to FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s decision to not recommend charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server . \u201c But as far as crime in the neighborhoods , people don \u2019 t feel safe . \u201d\nAccording to Politifact , Trump \u2019 s often-repeated assertion that there is no vetting system for Syrian refugees is not true . That process can take as long as one year or more , and each refugee is interviewed by officials in the Department of Homeland Security and required to attend cultural classes and pass a medical review .\n\u201c I will work with and appoint the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done , \u201d Trump declared , while not elaborating on how he would do so . \u201c In this race for the White House , I am the law-and-order candidate . \u201d\nIn light of the recent shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge , Trump claimed that the number of officers killed in the line of duty has increased by almost 50 percent year-to-year . The National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund says the number has gone up only slightly\u2014from 62 officers through July 20 of last year to 67 killed so far this year .\nTurning to the world\u2014and Clinton\u2014Trump said the U.S. should discontinue its policy of \u201c nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq , Libya , Egypt and Syria. \u201d But Trump supported the Libya intervention in 2011 , saying at the time : \u201c At this point , if you don \u2019 t get rid of Gaddafi , it \u2019 s a major , major black eye for this country . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s dubious contentions were not limited to law and order issues . The billionaire businessman claimed 14 million people \u201c left the workplace entirely. \u201d For context , the current workforce has 4.6 million more people than in 2009 . He criticized Obama on the national debt , claiming it doubled . It has actually increased from $ 11.1 trillion to $ 19.2 trillion .\nTrump also suggested that Clinton is responsible for the creation of ISIS in the Middle East\u2014even though the group did not formally split from al Qaeda until after she left office .
