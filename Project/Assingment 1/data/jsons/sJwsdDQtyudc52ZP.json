Metro After It Rejects Ad With Text Of 1st Amendment\nThe four plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority are from across the political spectrum : the American Civil Liberties Union , a health care group called Carafem that provides abortions , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos .\nWhat they have in common is that the transit agency known as WMATA has rejected their advertisements , saying the ads ran counter to its guidelines . They have now banded together , saying the guidelines introduced in 2015 violate their First Amendment right to free speech .\nIn fact , the ACLU 's rejected advertisement displays the text of the First Amendment in English , Arabic and Spanish , with the ACLU 's logo and the slogan `` We the People . ''\nWMATA did not explain in writing why it rejected the ACLU 's ad , according to the complaint . Outfront Media , which manages the system 's advertising , initially told the ACLU that it was rejected because it `` does not take any issue oriented advertising . '' Outfront later stated that `` you 'll need to dramatically change your creative in order to resubmit , '' the complaint says .\n`` In its zeal to avoid hosting offensive and hateful speech , the government has eliminated speech that makes us think , including the text of the First Amendment itself , '' said ACLU senior staff attorney Lee Rowland . `` The ACLU could not more strongly disagree with the values that Milo Yiannopoulos espouses , but we ca n't allow the government to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable . ''\nThe D.C. metro system changed its advertising policy in 2015 . According to the ACLU , it happened `` following controversy surrounding a set of anti-Muslim advertisement . '' The ACLU , Carafem and PETA had previously advertised with Metro .\nThe guidelines on commercial advertising , which are published on WMATA 's website , say medical messages are allowed `` only from government health organizations , or if the substance of the message is currently accepted by the American Medical Associated and/or the Food and Drug Administration . ''\nIt also blocks ads `` intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions , '' those `` that support or oppose an industry position or industry goal without any commercial benefit to the advertiser '' and those `` that are intended to influence public policy .
