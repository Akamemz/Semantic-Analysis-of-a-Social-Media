Read more\nA swaggering and aggressive US president called his speech at the White House on Thursday a \u201c celebration \u201d \u2013 and well he might . He was coming to the end of a week in which he had spent 80 minutes making the case for his re-election on primetime TV in his State of the Union address and had been acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 with only one Republican breaking ranks to vote against him . A Gallup poll put Trump \u2019 s approval rating at 49 % , the highest level for that survey since 2017 . And on top of that the Democratic primary race got off to a disastrously shambolic start in Iowa . Holding up a newspaper front page ( despite having called the mainstream media the enemy of the people ) that read \u201c Trump acquitted \u201d , the president told his White House crowd : \u201c Let me take that home ; maybe we \u2019 ll frame it .

Did he even win ? With almost 100 % of the vote in , Buttigieg is only 0.09 % ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count , and Sanders is ahead of the young pretender , who just turned 38 , in the popular vote . But the veteran Vermont senator , 78 , will now have to wait until the New Hampshire primary next week to attempt to grab his full share of the glory .\nThe billionaire former mayor of New York \u2019 s decision to sit out the early states and instead blanket California with advertising seems partially vindicated . With the usual momentum conferred on the winner of the Iowa caucuses blunted , a strong showing from Bloomberg in the array of populous states voting on Super Tuesday ( 3 March ) is bound to launch a thousand thinkpieces asking whether Bloomberg can elbow aside Joe Biden and Buttigieg and unite the centre . Feel queasy about a rich man buying the race ? Bloomberg has an answer . \u201c Someone said : \u2018 Are you spending too much money ? \u2019 and I said : \u2018 I \u2019 m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump. \u2019 And the guy said : \u2018 Spend more . \u2019 \u201d\nBarack Obama \u2019 s former vice-president went into the week as the frontrunner in the Democratic race and still leads most national polls and match-ups with Trump .
