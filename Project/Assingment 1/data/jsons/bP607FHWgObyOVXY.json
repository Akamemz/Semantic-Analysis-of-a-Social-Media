    "content": "In June , Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled out of MXDC , an upscale Mexican eatery in the nation 's capital . In September , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R\u2013Texas ) and his wife were hounded from Georgetown 's Fiola . In each instance , protesters associated with the group Smash Racism D.C. entered the restaurants and harangued their targets until they left .\nThe incidents provided further fodder for a newly heated national conversation about `` civility '' under Donald Trump 's presidency . Critics of the protesters bemoaned the radical left 's lack of good manners , while defenders argued that , with family separations at the border and the confirmation of an accused rapist to the Supreme Court , the time for politeness had passed . Both sides seemed to think the other was crossing lines that had previously been inviolable .\nBut such a claim is historically illiterate at best . The U.S. government has done worse , both domestically and abroad , and America 's public servants have faced much harsher blowback .\nConsider former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , today remembered as the overseer of America 's disastrous war in Vietnam . On November 2 , 1965 , he was in his office at the Pentagon when a young Quaker from Baltimore named Norman Morrison parked 40 feet from McNamara 's window , stepped into plain view , and doused himself in kerosene while holding his own infant daughter . As the story goes , Morrison tossed his daughter to a bystander seconds before burning himself alive to protest America 's military presence in Southeast Asia . McNamara watched him die ; even three decades later , talking about the incident with his literary collaborator Brian VanDeMark `` brought him to tears . ''\nWhile Morrison 's death was more jarring than any heckling visited on contemporary D.C. power holders , McNamara would face a still more physical and intimate protest a year later , when he traveled to Harvard to speak at the business school , which he 'd attended , and to address undergraduates in an off-the-record seminar hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School 's Institute of Politics .\nThe American ground war had just officially begun , and the radical-left Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) wanted McNamara to come clean about civilian casualties in Laos and Vietnam . When the SDS was denied a chance to question him at the Kennedy School forum , they decided to confront him as he left for another speaking engagement . Some 800 protesters surrounded McNamara 's car , which contained only the secretary and a driver armed with a pistol . ( In his 1995 memoir , In Retrospect , McNamara says the car also featured a tear-gas dispenser shaped like a pen , with which he once gassed Eunice Kennedy Shriver during a backseat demonstration . )\nThat 's when `` all hell broke loose , '' McNamara recounted . The protesters managed to block the car from the front and the back and began to rock the vehicle with McNamara inside . He had to stop his driver from running down the students , and then concluded that the only way to resolve the impasse was to step outside . Unguarded , he emerged into a furious crowd , where he agreed to answer two questions posed by Michael Ansara , the president of the Harvard SDS chapter .\nWhat happened next depends on whose history you 're reading . McNamara writes in his memoir that in order to prevent the protesters from becoming violent , he told them that he , too , had been politically engaged during his undergraduate days at Berkeley . `` I was tougher than you then and I 'm tougher than you today . I was more courteous then and I hope I am more courteous today , '' he claims he said .\nAnsara remembers the moment a little differently . In a 2017 retrospective published by The Harvard Crimson , the former student activist told reporter Laszlo B. Herwitz that the toughness line was a response to Ansara asking McNamara if he would n't disclose civilian casualties because he did n't know or because he did n't care .\n`` He started shrieking , ' I was tougher then and I 'm tougher now , ' '' Ansara told Herwitz , claiming that McNamara put his finger on Ansara 's chest as he said it . ( Both men agree that McNamara did n't say much else before jumping off the car 's hood and rushing through Quincy House , escorted by a student named Barney Frank , who would later go on to a 30-year career in Congress . )\nAfter McNamara returned to Washington , D.C. , he received a letter from Harvard College Dean John Munro , apologizing for the students ' behavior . McNamara would n't have it . He wrote back to Munro that `` dissent is both the prerogative and the preservative of free men everywhere . ''\nIn fact , McNamara endured dissent pretty much everywhere he went during his tenure as defense secretary , and he typically handled it with the same magnanimity .

'' McNamara recalled these incidents as stressful and upsetting , but he never once suggested that the people who confronted him were out of line , and he certainly did n't feel they were endangering him . ( Even when he actually was in danger , as was the case in 1972 , when a young man tried to throw him over the railing on a ferry headed to Martha 's Vineyard , he refused to press charges . )\nMcNamara defended Americans ' right to protest and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . While he and his family likely felt that certain parts of their lives should be off-limits , he seems to have understood , in a way contemporary wielders of bureaucratic and political power seemingly do not , that public servants should not expect the people they serve to observe government office hours .\nTo say they do n't make them like McNamara anymore would not exactly be true . The American war machine is chugging right along , and American politicians and bureaucrats will occasionally cop to their bad judgment once they 're no longer in power , as McNamara did in his memoir .\nEven in real time , McNamara had his doubts . He writes that he knew the Vietnam War was a bad idea before the U.S. deployed a ground force , and he knew that bombing Laos into oblivion would n't stop the flow of supplies and people from the North Vietnamese Army into South Vietnam . He did not do enough to stop President Lyndon Johnson from wading deeper into the conflict , and he accepted that the American public would make him pay for it .\nPerhaps that 's what is missing from today 's debate about civility . Public confrontation is a historically normal\u2014if unpleasant\u2014response to the immense power wielded by office holders .
