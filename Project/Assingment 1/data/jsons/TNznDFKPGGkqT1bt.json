    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , the White House announced , setting the scene for an unprecedented encounter between two nations that only recently threatened to wipe each other out .\nThe talks would be the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader and will take place by May , according to South Korea 's national security adviser , Chung Eui-yong , who delivered the invitation to Trump after a visit by his delegation to Pyongyang earlier this week . Chung said Kim had offered to put Pyongyang 's nuclear and missile program on the table .\nThe White House said Trump had agreed to the encounter . `` He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined , '' said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders .\nTrump 's decision , after a year in which the two have repeatedly traded insults , is a remarkable breakthrough . It brings the North Korean regime close to its long-desired aim of recognition on the international stage , and offers Trump the tantalizing prospect of a historic diplomatic victory . But the consequences of such a high-stakes gamble remain hard to predict .\nThe South Korean delegation , which landed in Washington , D.C. for a debriefing Thursday on the North-South talks , was careful to praise Trump 's influence over the developments . Chung said the US President 's `` leadership '' and his administration 's pressure on the North Korean regime had `` brought us to this juncture . ''\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump `` greatly appreciates the nice words '' of the delegation and South Korean President Moon Jae-in .\n`` He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined . We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea . In the meantime , all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain . ''\nTrump tweeted that `` great progress '' had been made but there would be no prospect of lifting sanctions until a deal was reached .\nSouth Korea 's President Moon described the announcement as `` historic '' and thanked both leaders for seeking a diplomatic solution to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .\n`` This is an almost miraculous event ; my administration will prepare toward the May meeting with utmost diligence , '' he said in remarks read out in Seoul by a Blue House spokesman .\nGeng Shuang , a spokesman at China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said the development was positive , and it was a moment to show `` political courage . '' But he stressed that China would continue to maintain sanctions on North Korea until a political settlement was reached .\nOther regional powers reacted cautiously . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked to President Donald Trump on the phone to reiterate the necessity of maintaining pressure on North Korea .\nAbe , briefing reporters after the call , said that the US and Japan had agreed to `` keep putting maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete actions toward denuclearization . ''\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her government welcomed `` any dialogue with North Korea '' but warned that `` North Korea has a history of making agreements and then failing to honor them . ''\nBishop said that , during any talks , Pyongyang must abide by its United Nations obligations to refrain from nuclear and missile tests .\nThe stunning announcement was the culmination of a diplomatic whirlwind that began with the invitation of a North Korean delegation to attend the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , South Korea . That event became the venue for a series of carefully orchestrated diplomatic overtures , which were reciprocated with a visit by a South Korean delegation to Pyongyang .\nDuring the visit , Kim reportedly joked over dinners of Korean hotpot and cold noodles . At one meeting , he said previous missile tests had caused Moon to schedule early morning national security meetings . `` I decided today ( to freeze the tests ) so he will not lose sleep anymore , '' he said , according to a South Korean presidential official .\nKim and the officials shared several bottles of wine , liquor made of ginseng and Pyongyang soju , the official said . `` The bottles kept coming , '' said another administrative source who had official knowledge of the meeting .\nThe alcohol-fueled diplomacy ended in dramatic fashion at the White House on Thursday .\nChung , the South Korean national security adviser , arrived at the White House shortly before 2:30 p.m. to meet with his US counterpart , H.R .
