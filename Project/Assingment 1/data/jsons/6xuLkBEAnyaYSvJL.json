''\nRove also sounded out against the Freedom Caucus in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal Wednesday , saying that the `` only lines crossed during this debacle were breached by the Freedom Caucusers , who committed political libel against their Republican colleagues , stopped the legislative process dead in its tracks , and saved Obamacare . ''\nHemmer told Rove that he was saying what Trump said in a tweet Thursday morning , when he called for a fight against the Freedom Caucus members who opposed the healthcare reform act , and Rove agreed .\n`` But I wish he was n't punching down , '' Rove told him .\nThe political strategist also disagreed with Freedom Caucus founding member Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , who earlier on the program commented that his group opposed the bill because it was against the caucus ' mission to `` change Washington . ''\n`` We appreciate the president , we 're trying to help the president . But look at the legislation . It does n't do what we told the voters we were going to do , '' said Jordan .\nThe AHCA , he continued , `` keeps Washington the same plain and simple . It does n't repeal Obamacare or lower premiums and most importantly it does n't unite Republicans , in that 17 percent of the country supports this legislation . ''\n`` With all due respect to Jim Jordan , that was jaw-dropping , '' said Rove . `` You heard him compare it to Obamacare . He says it does n't repeal Obamacare . Wait a minute , it kills a trillion in Obamacare taxes and kills the exchanges and stops the Medicaid expansion , dead , gone . ''\n`` Then what gets me is he says , well , it will have premium increases . '' said Rove . `` Why does it have premium increases in it ? Because it continues the Obamacare exchanges for two more years and the exchanges are broken and they 'll have year after year of premium increases . ''\nJordan , said Rove , voted for a repeal bill that would have taken two years to phase out the Obamacare exchanges , and would have carried with it two years of premium increases .\nMeanwhile , the Republican bill is the only one to reduce premiums , as under that bill , `` We get rid of the exchanges . ''\nIt would be okay for Trump to ramp up the pressure , continued Rove , but it would be better for him to do it in private than in public , because the Freedom Caucus in public will fight to keep from appearing to cave on the issue .\nPressure from the lawmakers ' colleagues would also work , and possibly be even more powerful than Trump 's tweets , said Rove .\nRove also commented on Trump 's decision to hire daughter Ivanka for an unpaid role in the West Wing , saying she has a background that `` can match up with a lot of people , '' but at the same time , `` you do n't want to hire people you ca n't fire . ''\n`` This is now the second family member in the West Wing , '' said Rove , as Trump 's daughter is married to senior adviser Jared Kushner .\n`` That 's a problem , '' said Rove . `` She 'll have to go through some gyrations to conform with the ethics rule , which she absolutely must conform with .
