    "content": "Surrounded by sleigh bell-ringing Santa Claus impersonators , Gov . Rick Perry on Thursday signed a law protecting Christmas and other holiday celebrations in Texas public schools from legal challenges - but also stressed that freedom of religion is not the same thing as freedom from religion .\nIt was a serious tone for an otherwise fun bill-signing and should bolster the governor 's Christian conservative credentials before he travels to Washington for the Faith & Freedom Coalition 's `` Road to Majority '' conference with the likes of tea party darlings and U.S. Sens . Marco Rubio of Florida , Kentucky 's Rand Paul and fellow Texan Ted Cruz .\nDubbed the `` Merry Christmas '' bill , the bipartisan measure sailed through the state House and Senate to reach Perry 's desk .\nIt removes legal risks of saying `` Merry Christmas '' in schools while also protecting traditional holiday symbols , such as a menorah or nativity scene , so long as more than one religion and a secular symbol are also reflected .\n`` I realize it 's only June . But it 's a good June and the holidays are coming early this year , '' Perry said. `` It 's a shame that a bill like this one I 'm signing today is even required , but I 'm glad that we 're standing up for religious freedom in this state . Religious freedom does not mean freedom from religion . ''\nDuring the last Sunday of the legislative session on May 26 , Rep. Donna Howard , an Austin Democrat , gave the Texas House 's daily prayer .\n`` We are fortunate to live in a country where we have the freedom to exercise the religion of our choosing while also being free from having any religion imposed upon us , '' said Howard , herself a Unitarian Universalist .\nHer words prompted some conservative lawmakers to hold their own , separate prayer session moments later .\nPerry did not mention Howard or her prayer , but invited to the signing ceremony cheerleaders from Kountze High School in East Texas . They were briefly barred by their school district from displaying banners with bible verses at football games . Perry decried the ban and a judge eventually ruled it violated students ' free speech rights .\nThe governor said Thursday that the law was for believers like the Kountze cheerleaders , who wore red `` I cheer for Jesus '' T-shirts .\nThe Faith & Freedom Coalition is a conservative , grass-roots advocacy group whose conference runs through the weekend . Perry heads to Washington on Friday .\nThe bill 's sponsor , Republican Rep. Dwayne Bohac of Houston , said he drafted it after discovering that his son 's school erected a `` holiday tree '' in December because any mention of Christmas could spark litigation .\n`` We hope that this is a fire that will take off and become laws in the other 49 states , '' said Bohac , who said his bill has attracted national attention .\nHe added of Perry : `` This is not a governor that shirks away from the tough issues . And this should not be a tough issue , which is what 's even amazing about all this . But this is just political correctness that 's run a-muck and our brains have been completely fallen out as a result . ''\nAs Perry signed the bill , 10 members of a group called the Lone Star Santas - with long white beards but wearing colorful summer garb rather than their traditional red suits - cheered and rang bells . Standing behind Perry 's desk was Glenn Westberry , or `` Santa G '' from Houston , and Rabbi Zev Johnson of the Rohr Chabad Jewish Center at the University of Texas .\nBoth cheered the bill , with Westberry saying he has been `` persona non grata in Texas schools for too long .
