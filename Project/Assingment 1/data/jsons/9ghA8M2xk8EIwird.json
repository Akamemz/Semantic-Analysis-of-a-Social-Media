This , Mr. Denham told his 10-year-old twin daughters , was a real-life \u201c civics lesson . \u201d\nThen he walked outside after the event , and there \u201c were state police cars everywhere. \u201d Someone had called for backup . \u201c Such a tremendous police response to free speech , \u201d Denham says , dismayed .\nThen former North Carolina Gov . Pat McCrory suggested that a series of similarly contentious town halls across the country were the result of paid protests .\nAs a result , Denham says he has gone from \u201c galvanized \u201d citizen to one \u201c on fire . \u201d\nUntil last month , Denham did not know which congressional district he lived in , he says in a phone interview . But last Friday , he drove an hour and a half from his suburban home near Atlanta to the constituent event held by the offices of Georgia 's two senators and a representative from a different district just so he could see and be heard .\nHe is one of the citizen activists who has risen up in what appears to be an uncanny reprisal of the 2009 birth of the tea party \u2013 but this time on the left .\nIn 2009 , the Democratic playbook involved avoiding town halls and dismissing protesters as paid stooges . Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D ) famously said the protesters were not grass roots but fake \u201c Astroturf. \u201d A year later , tea party fervor reshaped Congress , with Democrats losing 63 seats in the House and five in the Senate . The Democrats have never recovered .\nToday , the Republican playbook involves avoiding town halls and dismissing protesters as paid stooges . Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( R ) called the protest that shouted him down at a recent town hall a \u201c paid attempt to bully and intimidate. \u201d Only 10 Republicans members of Congress are planning town halls next week , notes David Hawkings of Roll Call .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a dangerous gamble , for democracy over the long haul but also for the lawmakers \u2019 own self-preservation as soon as the next campaign , \u201d he writes in his blog .\nMany political analysts agree . Republican lawmakers ignore Denham and his twin daughters at their peril . The events are certainly uncomfortable . Chants of \u201c Shame ! \u201d and \u201c Do your job ! \u201d have punctuated recent town halls . But , as in 2009 , they speak to a deep unease that can not be conveniently ignored .\n\u201c Democracy is a messy thing , and this shows it \u2013 and it \u2019 s also a fragile thing , \u201d says James Thurber , founder of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington . \u201c That \u2019 s why members of Congress have got to get used to this and listen to the feedback or there will be consequences for them , electorally . \u201d\nSome have . Rep. Justin Amash ( R ) of Michigan stayed an extra 40 minutes to talk with angry constituents . And Rep.
