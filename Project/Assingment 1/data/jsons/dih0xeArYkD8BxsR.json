It has also reshaped the way journalists work, not least because many authorities in many countries have cited the contagion as a reason to crack down on the news media.\n\nCertain dangers will subside with time: a vaccine for COVID-19 should ultimately protect people, including journalists, from spreading or contracting the virus. But some of the measures put into place that restrict press freedom \u2013 whether intended or not \u2014 could continue well into the future, experts say. Click to explore a map of the data\n\nIt is possible that responses to the coronavirus could shift the long-term paradigm for journalism in unforeseen ways, in the same way the attacks of September 11, 2001, fueled the global expansion of anti-terrorism laws \u2013 and in turn, ushered in an uptick in the jailing of journalists that continues today.\n\nGlobal press freedom violations that CPJ has documented in relation to the pandemic can roughly be divided into 10 categories to monitor (with examples cited):\n\n1. Laws against \u201cfake news\u201d\n\nThe pandemic has provided governments with a new excuse to wield laws criminalizing the spread of \u201cfake news,\u201d \u201cmisinformation,\u201d or \u201cfalse information\u201d \u2014 and offered a reason to implement new ones. Over the past seven years, the number of journalists imprisoned on charges of \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201cfalse news\u201d has climbed, according to CPJ research.\n\nCarlos Gaio, a U.K.-based senior legal officer with the Media Legal Defence Initiative, told CPJ that \u201cfake news\u201d laws will continue to spread as governments try to control messaging about the virus, affecting journalists and fact-checkers alike. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated subject to outlaw something like that [and it] is very, very dangerous,\u201d Gaio said.\n\nDisinformation is a real problem, but these legal measures give governments latitude to decide what they consider to be false, sending a chilling message to critical journalists. In the U.S., President Donald Trump frequently disparages the media\u2019s COVID-19 coverage and uses the term \u201cfake news\u201d when he disagrees with reporting, a strategy that CPJ has found effectively discredits the media and erodes public trust. It serves as a green light for authoritarians to deride and prosecute their own press.\n\nSouth Africa on March 18 criminalized disinformation about the pandemic with penalties that include hefty fines and jail time \u2013 a particularly worrying move since the country often serves as a regional model.\n\nPuerto Rico, a U.S. territory, on April 6 made it illegal for media outlets to \u201ctransmit or allow the transmission\u201d of \u201cfalse information.\u201d Violators could face up to six months in prison and fines up to $5000.\n\n2. Jailing journalists\n\nArresting journalists has long been a tactic of authoritarian governments looking to silence critical reporting; at least 250 journalists were jailed worldwide at CPJ\u2019s last annual count in December. With COVID-19 in circulation, imprisonment could be deadly; journalists are held in unsanitary conditions and forced into close proximity with others who could be infected. CPJ and more than 190 partner organizations have called on authorities worldwide to release all journalists jailed because of their work.\n\nNonetheless, arrests continue.\n\nIn India, authorities in Tamil Nadu state arrested on April 23 the founder of SimpliCity news portal and accused him of violating the antiquated Epidemic Diseases Act and other laws. The website had alleged government corruption in food distribution efforts related to the pandemic.\n\nJordan\u2019s military arrested two journalists for satellite channel Roya TV on April 10 in relation to a report on worker complaints about the economic impact of a curfew.\n\nSomali authorities arrested an editor for Goobjoog Media Group on April 14 and accused him of spreading false news and offending the president\u2019s honor after the journalist posted criticism on Facebook of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.\n\n3. Suspending free speech\n\nSome governments\u2019 emergency measures have revoked or suspended the right to free speech for the duration of the emergency.\n\nLiberia\u2019s constitution protects freedom of expression \u201csave during an emergency\u201d and affords presidential power to \u201csuspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees\u201d during a state of emergency like the one imposed April 11.\n\nHonduras on March 16 declared a temporary state of emergency that suspended some articles of the constitution, including the one that protects the right to free expression (though the government reversed that measure days later).\n\n4. Blunt censorship, online and off\n\nAuthorities in several countries suspended newspaper distribution and printing in what they called an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Elsewhere, media regulators have blocked websites or removed articles with critical coverage.\n\nJordan, Oman, Morocco, Yemen, and Iran all suspended newspaper distribution in March.\n\nTajikistan blocked independent news website Akhbor on April 9, after it reported critically on the government.\n\nRussia\u2019s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, ordered radio station Ekho Moskvy to take down an interview with a disease expert, and news website Govorit Magadan to remove an article about a local pneumonia death.\n\n5. Threatening and harassing journalists, online and off\n\nGovernment officials and private citizens alike have responded to critical reporting on the pandemic response with violence and threats. In places where the reporting environment was already hazardous, the situation has grown more fraught.\n\nChechnya\u2019s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, threatened a Novaya Gazeta reporter after she wrote on April 12 that Chechens had stopped reporting coronavirus symptoms for fear of being labeled \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nHaitian journalists were assaulted by unidentified men at the government\u2019s National Identification Office on April 2 as they investigated claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines on social distancing.\n\nGhanaian soldiers enforcing restrictions related to the pandemic assaulted journalists in two separate incidents in April.\n\n6. Accreditation requirements and restricted freedom of movement\n\nAuthorities have restricted journalists\u2019 ability to move about freely, such as if they want to report during curfews, or enter hospitals to get a first-hand account of health care. Sometimes the press is granted special access, but requiring members of the media to have government-issued press credentials allows leaders to decide who gets counted as a journalist.\n\nCPJ research shows that this leaves open the possibility that they will exclude those not affiliated with major outlets or those who report critically on the authorities.\n\nIndian police assaulted at least four journalists in three separate incidents in Hyderabad and Delhi on March 23 as they transited to or from work during the lockdown, even though national authorities have stated that journalists are exempt from the restrictions.\n\nNigeria required journalists to carry a valid identification card to move around certain locked down areas, including the capital Abuja, and designated only 16 journalists as allowed to enter the president\u2019s villa.\n\n7. Restricted access to information\n\nLaws on freedom of information that allow journalists to request government data and records have been suspended. Government proceedings that journalists usually attend have moved online, with varying degrees of access for the press. In the U.S., Trump\u2019s antagonism to journalists sets a poor example for U.S. state and local officials.\n\nGaio told CPJ that these trends are likely to persist. \u201c[Governments] will make it more difficult for officials to provide information. Access to information will take longer, and it will make it more complicated for journalists to access public spaces because of infection risks,\u201d he said.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on March 23 signed a measure into law that suspends deadlines for public authorities and institutions to respond to requests for information, and does away with appeals in case of denial. (Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the measure on April 30, according to news reports.)\n\nUnited States governors and mayors have created a patchwork of access to press conferences around the country. In Florida, the governor on March 28 barred one reporter from attending a press conference after she asked about social distancing measures.\n\n8. Expulsions and visa restrictions\n\nIn order to control the narrative of how the government is responding to COVID-19, some states are being inhospitable to foreign media, which in some places has traditionally enjoyed greater latitude than locals to report critically.\n\nChina and the United States have been engaged in a tit-for-tat over journalist access since early in 2020. Among the developments: In February, China forced out three Wall Street Journal reporters, ostensibly in retaliation for a headline on an opinion piece about COVID-19. In March, the U.S. imposed a limit of 100 on the number of visas for Chinese state media; China retaliated by terminating visas for at least 13 U.S. reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nEgypt expelled Guardian reporter Ruth Michaelson in retaliation for her report on March 15 that cast doubt on the government\u2019s official statistics regarding the pandemic.\n\n9. Surveillance and contact tracing\n\nGovernments around the world are monitoring mobile phone location data and testing or rolling out new tracking apps to follow the spread of COVID-19, according to news reports. the surveillance could imperil source confidentiality. The systems are introduced with limited oversight, and could endure long after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a concern that emergency situations create new baseline expectations for what kind of surveillance the government is authorized to conduct. We certainly saw this through 9-11, but I think the same issue is presented here,\u201d said Carrie DeCell, a staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute in New York. \u201cActions that might be justified in that particular context certainly would not be justified once governments get a handle on this pandemic and once the crisis subsides somewhere in the near future.\u201d\n\nDavid Maass, a senior investigative researcher at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, agreed that once law enforcement is given a new technology, it\u2019s difficult to take it back. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that today they\u2019re using it for this very dangerous virus, but we don\u2019t know what will happen later.\u201d\n\nTelecom companies in Italy, Germany, and Austria are turning over location data to public health officials, though aggregated and anonymized; governments in South Korea and South Africa are monitoring individual cell phone locations, and Israel authorized security agents to access location and other data from millions of mobile phone users.\n\n10. Emergency Measures\n\nAuthoritarian rulers can take an opportunistic approach to emergency measures that criminalize or restrict newsgathering activities, as CPJ has documented previously.\n\nHungary\u2019s parliament on March 30 approved a set of emergency laws enabling Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to rule by decree.\n\nThailand introduced on March 26 a state of emergency that allows the government to \u201ccorrect\u201d reports it considers incorrect and allows for charges against journalists under the Computer Crimes Act, which carries five-year prison penalties for violations.\n\nWith many countries still under states of emergency that grant authorities power to rule by decree \u2014 and the virus only beginning to take hold in some developing countries \u2013 even more restrictions could be on the way.\n\nKatherine Jacobsen is CPJ\u2019s U.S. research associate.
