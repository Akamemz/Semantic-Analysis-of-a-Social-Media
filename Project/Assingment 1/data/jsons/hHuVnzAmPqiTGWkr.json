    "content": "While serving in the U.S. Navy more than three decades ago , Chad Linton pleaded guilty to driving under the influence , a misdemeanor , and attempting to evade a police vehicle , a Class C felony , in Island County , Washington . More than four decades ago , when he was 18 , Paul Stewart was found guilty of first-degree burglary , a felony , after hopping a fence and stealing tools from an unlocked telephone company truck in Yuma County , Arizona . In both cases , the felony convictions were eventually vacated , and both men 's firearm rights were restored .\nBut not according to the state of California , where Linton and Stewart have long led law-abiding lives . The California Department of Justice ( DOJ ) maintains that their vacated felony convictions forever disqualify them from buying or possessing guns . Last week Linton and Stewart , joined by the Firearms Policy Coalition and three other gun rights groups , filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco , arguing that California 's policy violates the Second Amendment , the Full Faith and Credit Clause , and the Privileges and Immunities Clause .\nCalifornia law , like federal law , prohibits people with felony convictions from owning firearms .

In Linton 's case , the DOJ 's Bureau of Firearms sent agents to his home in San Bernardino County last April and confiscated several guns he had legally purchased ( or so he thought ) after passing background checks . The complaint says the agents , after seeing Washington court documents showing that Linton 's conviction had been vacated and his firearm rights restored , thought his guns should be returned , but they were overruled by Deputy Attorney General Robert Wilson .\nAccording to the complaint , Wilson told Linton 's attorney , Adam Richards , during a telephone conversation in September that Linton 's only remedy would be a presidential pardon\u2014an odd suggestion , not only because his conviction had been vacated but because the president does not have the power to pardon state crimes . `` During our call , '' Richards said in a December 4 letter to Wilson that is included as an exhibit in the lawsuit , `` you stated that the only measure that would restore [ Linton 's ] rights , according to your Department , is a presidential pardon .
