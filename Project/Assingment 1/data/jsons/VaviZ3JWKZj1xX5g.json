And he 's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president , and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor .\n`` Because I never agreed to testify , it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report ' about me , some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good ( or me to look bad ) , '' Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh .\nSome current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation .\nOne official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team , John Dowd and Ty Cobb , who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed .
