Because of my religious awakening in high school and the subsequent falling out I had with God in college , its symbols and stories were too freighted with meaning for me just to enjoy the pretty colors .\nBut I used to be a true believer . My parents made sure all five of their children were baptized and went to catechism until they had their first communion , which among Catholics is the first time a child receives the body of Christ in the form of unleavened bread and His blood in the form of wine .\nFor those who may not know , Catholics ( like I was ) are taught that , when consecrated by a priest , a thin piece of bread that looks like a Vanilla Wafer that \u2019 s been left out in the sun and tastes like glue smells is the body of the messiah .\nFor some reason , this doctrine of \u201c transubstantiation \u201d was always the most difficult for me to accept \u2014 even during my conservative Catholic phase , which lasted from my sophomore year of high school until my second year of college . Perhaps it shouldn \u2019 t have been so hard , given the other things I thought at the time . If you believe in the virgin birth of Christ , the miracles He performed \u2014 see , my feelings toward religion are so ambivalent I questioned whether capitalizing \u201c He \u201d would constitute a betrayal of my values \u2014 that a man rose from the dead after three days and then ascended to heaven , it shouldn \u2019 t have been such a stretch .\nFor a gay teen not ready to come to terms with his sexuality , the Church \u2019 s teachings about homosexuality also offered a convenient way to hide . I wasn \u2019 t attracted to women , but the expectation of sexual purity took sexuality out of the picture \u2014 I could simply ignore my attraction to men .\nMy attraction to religion wasn \u2019 t all about self-hatred , though . Catholicism was the first intellectual tradition I was introduced to . Growing up on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona , where no one I know reads the uppity New Yorker , the writings of Saint Augustin , Saint Thomas Aquinas and Blaise Pascal provided a rich lens through which I could view and parse the world . During high school I spent many a late night discussing theology with my grandmother , a devout Catholic and the person who is most like me in the family .\nI was an absolutist as a Catholic , and to this day I can \u2019 t understand \u201c cafeteria Catholics \u201d \u2014 a term orthodox Catholics use to describe those who pick and choose which things to believe . If people were to be expected to believe all this out-there stuff without proof , the authority behind the information would have to be pretty strong and reliable . The Catholic Church makes claims consistent with this point of view . Take , for instance , the doctrine of Papal Infallibility , which dictates that , when speaking on the subjects of faith and morals and the full authority of the Papal office , the pope is infallible . Wouldn \u2019 t God be likely to give him the keys while He was out ? The Church \u2019 s authoritarianism and absolutism made its claim to infallibility more credible .\nBut I also grew to admire its rituals deeply as well as its music , art and literature .
