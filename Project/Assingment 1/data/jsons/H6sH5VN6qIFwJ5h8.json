Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , is still using a strict present-tense \u201c not running \u201d as her answer to questions about her possible presidential ambitions . But that seems increasingly likely to change given the overwhelmingly positive ( and generally overwhelming ) coverage of her bid to harass the White House and Senate leaders over Wall Street carve outs stuffed in a fiscal-cliff spending bill . The Daily Beast called her the \u201c most powerful Democrat in America. \u201d The WaPo warned Warren \u2019 s moves may force 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton to alter her plans . And Warren got star treatment all up and down the major media corridor . Most remarkable is that in doing what was previously called reckless embitterment when Republican renegades did it , Warren is leading a movement in which \u201c the Democratic Party debates its soul. \u201d Oh dear . Somebody get the smelling salts .\n[ Howard Kurtz writes : \u201c She \u2019 s been a press favorite roughly forever . But by standing up to a Democratic president and bringing the government to within hours of a shutdown , the freshman senator is being lionized like never before . \u201d ]\nThat escalated quickly - Whether or not Warren really can disrupt the multi-billion-dollar rock crusher of a campaign that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is putting together , we get a pretty good idea of what the party base and the political press would like to see . Right now , it seems that the fantasy scenario is for Warren to run , pushing ( excusing ) Hillary to reveal herself as the true liberal she was born to be . The happy story for Democrats ends as Hillary eradicates whomever the hapless Republican nominee happens to be . While Warren certainly speaks to the enormous political energy among those who believe the system is rigged against ordinary people , those cheering the Democrats \u2019 turn toward ideological purity in the wake of an election loss ought to remember that such movements , once ignited , are nearly impossible to douse quickly . While it might be fun for journalists and liberal activists to watch Warren hot on Hillary \u2019 s heels , the party \u2019 s chances in 2016 are worse than the conventional wisdom suggests , and Hillary is a far weaker candidate than coverage would indicate . Democrats are embarking on a very dangerous flight of fancy .\n[ WaPo : \u201c If the loss of the Senate intensified strains within the party , the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that passed Saturday night raised two issues that acted as matches to gasoline . \u201d ]\nMmmhmm - How is President Obama \u2013 currently taking hits on the left for coziness with the CIA and his ties to Wall Street \u2013 doing with the new face of the American left ? Hunky dory , claims the White House .\nWait . What ? - \u201c And Elizabeth Warren is -- even if people don \u2019 t agree with her , she \u2019 s constructive . She \u2019 s not like Ted Cruz and say , shut down the government or don \u2019 t fund things if I don \u2019 t get my way. \u201d \u2013 Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nHillary as Dems \u2019 Romney ? - The Federalist \u2019 s Daryl Harsanyi writes that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is all but obliged to run for president : \u201c That \u2019 s because Hillary is the Democrats \u2019 Mitt Romney . And Democrats would be engaging in a historic act of negligence if they allowed her to run unopposed for presidency . \u201d\nIt took Macy \u2019 s and Coca Cola to finish the job of turning a 4th century Greek presbyter and signatory of the Nicene Creed into a plump fellow in a red suit who became the international symbol of a certain kind of conditional , transactional love ( \u201c you \u2019 d better be good for goodness sake. \u201d ) But as Midcentury America and its Baby Boom children tired of the very Victorian , judgmental hero of secular Christmas , Kris Kringle needed a sidekick to lighten things up . It was General Electric and Montgomery Ward that brought the biggest update to the Santa Claus tradition since \u201c \u2018 Twas the Night Before Christmas \u201d in the 1820s . Last week saw the 50th airing of the television special \u201c Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. \u201d But Americans first met the star of the show in 1939 when copywriter Robert L. May wrote the story for Montgomery Ward \u2019 s annual Christmas catalogue , originally naming the reindeer , Reginald . May had his brother-in-law , Johnny Marks , write a song about the character which Gene Autry turned into the second-biggest-selling Christmas song of all time . General Electric worked with Marks to create the holiday special as a means of product promotion during the holiday season . And thus , America was gifted with an unlikely hero with a light bulb for a nose .\nObama Job Approval : Approve \u2013 41.8 percent//Disapprove \u2013 53.3 percent\nDirection of Country : Right Direction \u2013 26.7 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 65.7 percent\nWith a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill headed for President Obama \u2019 s signature , the political reviews of Ted Cruz \u2019 s challenge to Republican leadership in the Senate over the weekend described anger within the party directed at Texas senator . Some GOP senators saw an echo of last year \u2019 s partial government shutdown in Cruz \u2019 s objection to the bill based on his opposition to Obama \u2019 s temporary amnesty edict . Others criticized the move as opening the door for Democrats to push through controversial Obama nominations . While Cruz appears to have taken a hit amongst his colleagues , he is unapologetic and may in fact be working the long game with eye to a potential 2016 presidential bid .\n[ \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c [ A ] verting a partial government shutdown\u2026 [ t ] he Senate voted 56-40 for the long-term funding bill [ late Saturday ] , the main item left on Congress \u2019 year-end agenda .

According to several of the senator \u2019 s top advisers , Cruz sees a path to victory that relies instead on increasing conservative turnout ; attracting votes from groups \u2014 including Jews , Hispanics , and Millennials \u2014 that have tended to favor Democrats ; and , in the words of one Cruz strategist , \u2018 not getting killed with independents. \u2019 \u2026 \u2018 He \u2019 s looking at the race very seriously , \u201d says a senior adviser , who confirms that Cruz \u2019 s campaign headquarters would be based in Houston .
