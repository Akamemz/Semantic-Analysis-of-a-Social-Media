    "content_original": "Supreme Court justices pose for their group portrait at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., November 30, 2018. (Jim Young/Reuters)\n\nIt\u2019s always a good day when even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writes like an originalist \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what she did when she wrote the opinion for seven justices in Timbs v. Indiana (justices Gorsuch and Thomas filed separate concurring opinions). At issue was the important question of whether the Eighth Amendment\u2019s excessive fines clause applied to the states and whether the excessive fines clause applied to a practice called in rem civil-asset forfeiture. Under this practice, law-enforcement officials often engage in two separate punitive legal processes against criminal defendants. The first is the criminal prosecution itself, which can impose prison sentences and fines according to statutorily defined punishments. The second is often a civil action against the criminal defendant\u2019s property. Yes, the government will file suit against trucks, cars, jewelry, boats, and cash \u2014 leading to absurd case captions like, say, Texas v. One Gold Crucifix \u2014 claiming that the property was used for criminal purposes and then seize that property under a lower, civil, burden of proof.\n\nAs a result, a defendant can often lose their property without ever being convicted of a crime. Even if convicted of a crime, they can face asset forfeiture that far, far exceeds the amount of any criminal financial penalty under applicable. Then, often, law enforcement turns around and sells the property or pockets the cash \u2014 using it to pad state and local law-enforcement budgets. The practice is so common that in 2014, for example, the state took more money from citizens than burglars took from crime victims.\n\nThanks to the Supreme Court, civil-asset forfeiture now faces a new and substantial constitutional obstacle.

III, ch. 14, in 1 Eng. Stat. at Large 5 (1225).
