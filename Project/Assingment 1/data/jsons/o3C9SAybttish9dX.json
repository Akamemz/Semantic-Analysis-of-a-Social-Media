''\n\u201c Based on her ideas and her leadership , Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States , \u201d the Vermont senator told the rowdy and emotional convention crowd , with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks and chanting his name .\nSanders appealed to supporters Monday night to get behind Clinton , as he tried to restore order at the Democratic convention after a chaotic opening day marked by intense street protests and near-constant disruptions inside the arena from delegates and others loyal to him .\nSanders suddenly found himself in the role of helping the Democratic Party whose establishment had shunned him for much of the primary race . But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention , where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the party \u2019 s presidential nominee on Tuesday .\n\u201c I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process .
