Namely , will Mr. Trump continue to defer to Mr. McConnell , or will he muddy the messaging at this high-stakes juncture in his presidency ?\nBut over time they 've developed a mutual respect . Through experience \u2013 passage of major tax reform and the confirmation of a record number of federal judges , including two Supreme Court justices \u2013 President Trump has learned that Mr. McConnell \u2019 s advice is worth listening to . Both men are all about winning , whether in elections or on legislation and confirmations or , now , in ensuring that Mr. Trump survives an election-year impeachment trial with party unity intact .\nWhen Donald Trump became president , he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were wary of one another . To some in the Trump camp , it doesn \u2019 t get any \u201c swampier \u201d than Mr. McConnell \u2013 now finishing his sixth term in the Senate .\nOne is a charismatic showman who operates on gut and instinct . The other is low on charisma and shrewdly calculating . One is a political outsider who has remade the Republican Party in his own populist image . The other embodies the GOP establishment .\nYet despite some high-profile clashes \u2013 punctuated by angry tweets \u2013 President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have made their relationship work . Foremost , they \u2019 re both all about winning , whether in elections or on legislation and confirmations or , now , in ensuring that President Trump survives an election-year impeachment trial with party unity intact .\nThrough experience \u2013 passage of major tax reform and the confirmation of a record number of federal judges , including two Supreme Court justices \u2013 Mr. Trump has learned that Mr. McConnell \u2019 s advice is worth listening to .\n\u201c The president , I think , sees Mitch as a Class A operator , a master of the Senate , who has helped him tremendously to move his legislative agenda through , \u201d says Chris Ruddy , CEO of the conservative Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump , in an email . \u201c He \u2019 s also a pretty frank guy , and I know the president appreciates that candidness . \u201d\nMr. Ruddy acknowledges that when Mr. Trump became president , the two men were \u201c somewhat wary of each other. \u201d But over time they \u2019 ve developed a mutual respect . \u201c They both like winners and put a value on getting things done , \u201d he says .\nThis hard-fought alliance now faces a major test in the Senate trial , which began in earnest Tuesday . Namely , will Mr. Trump continue to defer to Mr. McConnell , or will he muddy the messaging at this high-stakes juncture in his presidency ?\nSince his Dec. 18 impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress , Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on what he wants \u2013 from \u201c outright dismissal \u201d of the articles of impeachment to the calling of Democratic witnesses , including former Vice President Joe Biden , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff .\nMr. McConnell has said that an effort to dismiss the case would fall short , to the president \u2019 s embarrassment . Furthermore , for Mr. Trump , being acquitted after a trial sends a stronger reelection message than a dismissal , presidential allies argue .\nMr. McConnell and Mr. Trump \u2019 s lawyers oppose the calling of witnesses ; Democrats want to call four , including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney , and question them about Mr. Trump \u2019 s alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine to help in his reelection effort .\nFor now , the McConnell game plan , in conjunction with the Trump lawyers , is in effect . But with the mercurial Mr. Trump , one can never be sure what he might say or do .\nIndeed , for all their shared goals , the two men can seem at times from different planets . The key to making any joint Trump-McConnell venture work , say sources connected to each , is to acknowledge those differing styles and take advantage of the best of each .\n\u201c McConnell \u2019 s not a golfer , McConnell \u2019 s not a backslapper , \u201d says Scott Jennings , a former campaign aide to Mr. McConnell from Kentucky . \u201c Think of them as a corporation . Someone \u2019 s got to work in sales and marketing and someone \u2019 s got to work in product engineering . \u201d\nAt the same time , Mr. Trump \u2019 s alliance with Mr. McConnell reflects a pragmatic streak in the president , a willingness to compromise on his stated goal of \u201c draining the swamp \u201d \u2013 that is , changing the way Washington works . Because to some in the Trump camp , it doesn \u2019 t get any swampier than Mr. McConnell \u2013 now finishing his sixth term in the Senate and expected to win his seventh in November . Former aides to Mr. McConnell are all over Washington , working as lobbyists and consultants .\nKen Cuccinelli , a Trump acolyte and top official at the Department of Homeland Security , once called Mr. McConnell the \u201c head alligator \u201d in the swamp .\nThat type of rhetoric may have resonated with Mr. Trump when he first arrived in Washington . Certainly , the early going between the two was rough . In July 2017 , when the Senate failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act , Mr. Trump was furious \u2013 spurring a month of severely strained relations , punctuated by angry presidential tweets slamming Mr. McConnell by name . A phone call between the two men reportedly descended into a profanity-laced shouting match , followed by weeks of no contact .\nMr. McConnell faced other sources of frustration that summer , including Mr. Trump \u2019 s controversial reaction to protests by white supremacists in Charlottesville , Virginia , and the president \u2019 s open antagonism toward some of Mr. McConnell \u2019 s GOP Senate colleagues .\nComplicating matters was the position of Mr. McConnell \u2019 s wife , Elaine Chao , as transportation secretary . When asked that summer about the tensions between her husband and Mr. Trump , she said , \u201c I stand by my man \u2013 both of them . \u201d\nBy the end of the summer , the two men had patched things over . Populist bomb-thrower Steve Bannon , a major McConnell antagonist , was out as Mr. Trump \u2019 s chief White House strategist , and tax reform was on its way to passage . The president \u2019 s mood was brightening .\nOn the effort to repeal \u201c Obamacare , \u201d \u201c McConnell got it as close as he could , but the votes weren \u2019 t there , \u201d Mr. Jennings says . \u201c From that day forward , they \u2019 ve been hand in glove on just about everything . \u201d\nLast year , Mr. McConnell even gave himself a nickname \u2013 the \u201c Grim Reaper \u201d \u2013 as he promised to defeat all progressive proposals in the Senate .\nAt this point , \u201c McConnell is probably one of his best advisers , and Trump probably realizes that , \u201d says Al Cross , a former longtime Louisville reporter , now at the University of Kentucky in Lexington .\nFor Mr. Trump , having an ally who doesn \u2019 t compete for the spotlight is a plus . Mr. McConnell is famously taciturn , and keeps his own counsel .\n\u201c McConnell keeps things close to the vest , even with his own leadership team .
