The Fox News debate Thursday night exposed few new rifts between the contenders and featured candidates mostly sticking to message .\nThe debate had a lackluster quality , and it 's not just because Trump was n't there . Perhaps because Trump 's dominance drove them to desperation in earlier debates , every candidate had thrown his best punch before strutting onto stage Thursday night .\nIt was like getting the band back together to play the greatest hits : New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie said Washington stinks . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio questioned each other 's character . Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul does n't like the National Security Agency . Ben Carson reminded voters he 's not a professional politician .\nViewers learned little new about the candidates ' policy stances , and -- aside from Jeb Bush showing the kind of passion his supporters have long craved -- they also saw few stylistic differences .\nThis debate wo n't change many minds . So close to the first votes being cast , the candidates were either trying not to stumble before the Iowa caucuses , or trying to survive and advance to the New Hampshire primary . It 's time to give them what they want .\nEveryone had their one-liners about Trump as the debate opened .\nCruz joked , in his opening statement : `` I 'm a maniac , and everyone on this stage is stupid , fat and ugly . Ben , you 're a terrible surgeon . Now that we 've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way ... ''\nOffered Bush : `` I kind of miss Donald Trump . He was a little teddy bear to me . Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him . ''\nHis absence exposed a reality of most of the Republican debates : Bombastic as he 's been , Trump was never really at the center of any policy battles . What he brought was personality -- so the only way to tell whether his absence affected much comes not in the substance , but in the TV ratings .\nHis rival event -- a rally and fundraiser for veterans -- caused a split-screen atmosphere for GOP voters and even drew two of his competitors to join him . Undercard debaters Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum -- the winners of the last two Republican caucuses in Iowa -- stood on stage with the front-runner .\nWithout Trump on stage , Cruz entered the night expecting to be bounced around like a pinball .\nHe survived -- but it was n't always pretty and some thought the Texas senator did worse than others . The Des Moines Register ruled it a `` Rough night for Cruz '' in its front-page above-the-fold review of the debate .\nHe lost a battle of volume with moderator Chris Wallace when he tried to interject early in the debate .\n`` I would note that that the last four questions have been , 'Rand , please attack Ted . Marco , please attack Ted . Chris , please attack Ted . Jeb , please attack Ted ... , '' Cruz said . He soon added a joking reference to Trump that sounded an awful lot like a complaint , saying : `` If you guys ask one more mean question , I may have to leave the stage . ''\nHe was hurt the most by Fox News ' decision to use video of candidates ' past statements , too -- a move that forced Cruz to explain away an amendment that would have granted undocumented immigrants legal status by hailing his allegiance with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , hardly a household name .\nCruz commanded the stage early in the debate , and withstood most of his opponents ' punches -- particularly because none were criticisms he had n't heard before .\nBut the night would have been much easier for him had Trump worn the biggest target .\nIn an alternate , non-Trump world , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio would be center stage . And they were Thursday night .\nEach senator knows that if Trump does n't fade , one of the freshman senators of Cuban heritage has to knock the other out to stand a chance beating the real estate mogul head-to-head .\nSo Rubio was working hard to court evangelical voters -- a particularly important constituency in Iowa and South Carolina .\nAsked about Time Magazine 's cover proclaiming him a Republican savior , Rubio said : `` There is only one savior and it 's not me . ''\nAt another point , he said the Bible `` commands us to shine our light on the world . '' He pointed to `` Judeo-Christian values that encourage us to reach out to the less fortunate . ''\nIt was perhaps the most important dynamic of the debate : Rubio 's attempt to chip into Cruz 's edge among evangelicals -- particularly in Iowa , where Bob Vander Plaats , a leader of the religious right , was working his way across the television cameras in the debate hall touting Cruz .\nCruz was n't ceding anything -- talking religion at every turn , including on energy . `` I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources , '' Cruz said . And at the end , he asked voters to `` examine our records and pray on it . ''\nThe advantage for candidates like Rand Paul , Jeb Bush and John Kasich is they had a chance to talk about their policy visions without Trump taunting them about their low poll numbers .\nPaul -- once an undercard debate-skipper himself and facing the potential for exclusion from ABC News ' debate before the New Hampshire primary -- had a good night showcasing his libertarian leanings . He called out Cruz for not showing up for the vote on the `` audit the Fed , '' and needled the Texan , saying of his campaign : `` It 's a falseness , and that 's an authenticity problem . ''\nBush , too , had a good night -- showing the kind of passion as he squared off with Rubio on immigration that his supporters wanted from the beginning of his campaign .\nNoting the policy similarities between them , he credited Rubio for trying to lead on immigration in 2013 -- `` and then he cut and run because it was n't popular amongst conservatives , I guess . ''\nChristie could also win plaudits from conservatives for his assertion that his Justice Department would prosecute Hillary Clinton .\n`` I will be ready .
