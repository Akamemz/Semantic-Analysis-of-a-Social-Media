    "content": "Hillary Clinton emerged from her showdown with the Republican-led House Benghazi Committee largely unscathed , fending off accusations that she failed to protect the four Americans who died in the 2012 attack \u2014 and avoiding any bombshells over her email account .\nThe 2016 Democratic front-runner had been eager to put the hearing in the rear view mirror , and her appearance at the punishing 11-hour event comes as she has the wind at her back . Last week she delivered a winning debate performance , and this week Vice President Joe Biden announced he would not challenge her for the White House .\nStill , the former Secretary of State faced sharp questions from Republicans about her handling of the run-up and aftermath of the attacks in Benghazi , which claimed the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans . GOP lawmakers repeatedly pressed her to explain why she didn \u2019 t know about Stevens \u2019 requests for more security .\nClinton addressed those questions with the same cool and calm demeanor that she kept up for the duration , save for some exasperated looks and a moment of levity towards the end of the day when Rep. Martha Roby ( R-Ala. ) asked if she was alone for the entirety of the night of the Benghazi attacks . Clinton laughed when she confirmed that she had indeed been alone all night .\nUltimately , Clinton said security on the ground wasn \u2019 t her job \u2014 but should Stevens have asked her for help , he would have gotten it . Clinton also told the committee that she `` lost more sleep than all of you put together '' over the Sept. 11 , 2012 attacks .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want anything that is said to me or about me to take away from the heroic efforts that the diplomatic security officers exhibited , \u201d Clinton said , before delivering a somber account of that night in Benghazi when Stevens and the security officers lost their lives .\nAmid all the back-and-forth over security , the lingering email scandal was the subtext for several lines of questioning , particularly when Republicans zeroed in on exchanges between Clinton and her long-time ally Sidney Blumenthal , who had encouraged her to be bold in Libya . Republicans noted that while security requests from Stevens never reached her inbox , her old friend \u2019 s unsubstantiated Libya intelligence and policy advice did .\n\u201c Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you , Madame Secretary , but the ambassador did not , \u201d Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) demanded .\nAnd at the end of the marathon day , after the panel had covered much of the same ground that previous Benghazi inquiries had -- though sometimes in greater detail -- Republicans turned more directly to the question of Clinton \u2019 s private email server , and what they called her \u201c changing story \u201d on the matter .\nStill , Gowdy seemed to suggest that the hearing failed to produce any major new revelations , at least at first blush . `` I do n't know that she testified that much differently today than the previous times she testified , '' Gowdy said after the hearing wrapped up around 9 p.m. , although he said he would have to go back through the transcript .\nAs she has done before over the past months , Clinton stated firmly that \u201c I turned over every work-related-email in my possession , \u201d an answer that left Republicans fuming .\n\u201c Secretary Clinton , seems like there 's a pattern , a pattern of changing your story , \u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) . \u201c You say one thing , the truth comes out , weeks and months later , you say something else . That 's not being the \u2018 most transparent person ever. \u2019 That 's not even being transparent\u2026 . How can we accept your statement that you 've turned over all work related e-mails and all e-mails about Libya ? \u201d\nClinton did refuse to answer questions about how her lawyers had selected which emails were work-related , and thus needed to be sent over the State Department to comply with record-keeping rules . She noted that the panel had already talked to her lawyer for \u201c nine hours \u201d \u2014 and deferred to her team for specifics .\nAs the day bled into evening and then night , Clinton increasingly chided the panel .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t help it that you don \u2019 t like the findings of [ State \u2019 s internal investigation of the attacks ] , \u201d she told Gowdy . \u201c I can \u2019 t help it that you don \u2019 t like the findings of the other committees . \u201d\nPanel Democrats also proved to be a huge asset for Clinton during the hearing , bashing that committee as a waste of money that has produced no new information and dismissing it as a political circus .\n\u201c It bothers me when I hear people imply you didn \u2019 t care about your people , \u201d Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings ( D-Md . ) said , as the room erupted in applause . \u201c That \u2019 s not right\u2026.I don \u2019 t know what we want from you\u2026 do we want to badger you until we get the \u2018 gotcha \u2019 moment ? We \u2019 re better than that\u2026 we are better than using taxpayer dollars to try to destroy a campaign . \u201d\nFor their part , Republicans kept hammering away at Clinton for what they said was her inability to grasp or get control of the deteriorating security situation in Libya . In a dramatic moment late in the evening , Rep. Peter Roskam ( R-Ill. ) held up a piece of paper and ripped it in half to demonstrate , he said , what happened to Steven \u2019 s request for more protections .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s what is what happened to their requests , \u201d he said , tearing the paper in half with a loud rip . \u201c They were torn up . \u201d\nBut Clinton reiterated at several points that no one ever told her they needed to withdraw from Libya .\n\u201c There was never a recommendation \u2026 to shut down Benghazi even after the two attacks that the compound suffered , \u201d she said . \u201c And perhaps you \u2019 d wonder why , but I can tell you it was thought that mission in Benghazi\u2026 was vital to our national interests\u2026No one ever came to me and said : We should shut down our compound in Benghazi . \u201d\nGowdy called up a series of June 2012 emails that he says show State \u2019 s Washington headquarters was not prioritizing the security needs of diplomats in the field .\nIn the emails \u2014 sent around the time an improvised explosive device exploded outside the Benghazi compound and a rocket-propelled grenade hit the British ambassador \u2019 s convoy , triggering the United Kingdom to shutter its consulate \u2014 Stevens requested more protection .\nAt the same time , Clinton \u2019 s top policy aide , Jake Sullivan , was emailing Stevens for his take on a Libya memo from Blumenthal , who Republicans believe may have personally pushed Clinton toward an aggressive Libya posture in hopes of furthering his business interests there .\nGowdy asked why Blumenthal \u2019 s emails reached her but Stevens \u2019 didn \u2019 t .\nClinton said Stevens could have reached out and he would have been \u201c immediately responded \u201d to \u2014 but he did not .\n\u201c You know , Mr. Chairman , I \u2019 ve said it before , I will say it again : \u2026 I communicated with him about certain issues . He did not raise security with me , \u201d she said . \u201c He raised the issue with security professionals . Now I know that \u2019 s not the answer you want to hear \u2026 but those are the facts . \u201d\nGowdy also questioned her on another email around that time from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland , asking Stevens for his advice on how to publicly \u201c message \u201d the violence in Libya .\n\u201c Having to stop and provide public messaging advice to your [ press shop ] \u201d is not what Stevens needed , Gowdy said . \u201c He didn \u2019 t need help messaging the violence . He needed help actually with the violence . ''\nThe two also tussled on whether Blumenthal \u2019 s emails were really \u201c unsolicited , \u201d with Gowdy asking her if she knew the definition of the word . When she said she did , Gowdy read a number of Clinton responses to Blumenthal , suggesting they weren \u2019 t unsolicited : \u201c Another keeper , thanks and please keep them coming \u201d or \u201c any other info about it ? \u201d\nClinton then tweaked her statement slightly , saying : \u201c They started out unsolicited . \u201d\nGowdy pounced : \u201c You did n't say they started off unsolicited . You said they were unsolicited . \u201d\n\u201c Well they were unsolicited , but obviously I did respond to some of them , \u201d she shot back .\nClinton repeated herself a number of times for emphasis : \u201c Sid Blumenthal was not my adviser , official or unofficial , on Libya. \u201d But Clinton did sometimes forward on his advice and unsubstantiated intelligence to her top aides .\nDemocrats have said Blumenthal is irrelevant and an attempt by the GOP to target her political allies .\nCalifornia Democrat Adam Schiff said the GOP is obsessed with Blumenthal and Clinton politics , and said the GOP used the bulk of their interview with Blumenthal this spring to ask questions far afield of Benghazi .\n\u201c Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Mr. Blumenthal \u2019 s relationship and communications with the Clintons but less than 20 questions about the Benghazi attacks , \u201d he said , launching into a bunch of comparisons . \u201c Republicans asked more than 270 questions about Mr. Blumenthal \u2019 s alleged business activities in Libya but no questions about the U.S. presence in Benghazi . \u201d\nAt times , Clinton appeared to get emotional , especially when asked how it felt to be the subject of an investigation that one Democrat said indirectly blamed her for the death of Stevens and three other Americans in the attacks .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very personally painful accusation , \u201d Clinton said , her voice shaking . \u201c It has been rejected and disproven by non-partisan , dispassionate investigators but , nevertheless , having it continue to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me . I would imagine I \u2019 ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together . I \u2019 ve lost more sleep than all of you put together . \u201d\nBut she fired back in kind if Republican questions got pointed . When Roskam accused Clinton of taking credit for the 2011 Libyan revolution when times were good , but disappearing the next year when things got sour , Clinton \u2014 looking annoyed \u2014 got the last word in .\n\u201c Well , congressman , that is only a political statement which you well understand , and I don \u2019 t understand what that has anything to do with what we were supposed to be talking about today , \u201d she said .\nBefore the hearing began , the hundreds of public seats were entirely filled by people who had been in line for hours to get access to the room , anticipating Clinton 's entrance and clamoring for pictures with smartphones .\nBy late morning , during some of the more technical lines of questioning , many of the public seats had emptied out . Several members of the public had fallen asleep , and former Rep. Tom Davis , seated in the front row of the public seating , had his eyes closed and hand over his head .\nBut while the audience may have been bored , there were several tense moments when Clinton faced off with Republicans \u2014 or when the Democrats jumped in to defend her .\nCummings blasted the committee as a partisan witch hunt out to get Clinton , saying Republicans formed the panel because they \u201c did not like the answers they got \u201d in previous probes \u2014 \u201c so they set up this select committee with no rules , no deadlines and an unlimited budget . \u201d\n\u201c They set them loose because you \u2019 re running for president , \u201d Cummings said , raising his voice before calling for the panel to disband . \u201c It is time for Republicans to end this \u2026 fishing expedition . \u201d\nIt took Cummings only a few minutes into the hearing to highlight a number of embarrassing moments for Gowdy in recent weeks , including comments by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) , Rep.
