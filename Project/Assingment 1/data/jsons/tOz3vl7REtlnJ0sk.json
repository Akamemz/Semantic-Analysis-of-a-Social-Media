And he upped the ante by tweeting a new USA Today/Suffolk University poll that shows 68 % of the 2016 Republican front-runner 's supporters would ditch the GOP and stick with him if he launched an independent campaign for the presidency .\nA new poll indicates that 68 % of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP & ran as an independent . https : //t.co/ztP5d2ctZl\nBy Wednesday morning , Trump continued to leave the door of an the independent run open , though he told ABC 's Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan that was an option he did n't want to pursue .\n`` The people , the Republican Party , have been -- the people -- have been phenomenal , '' Trump said . `` The party \u2014 I 'll let you know about that .

''\nEven former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush would n't backtrack from his pledge to support whoever wins the GOP nominating process if that happens to Trump , saying only , `` Look , he 's not going to be the nominee .
