    "content": "In a single moment , the Orlando shooting brought together three of the most contentious issues in the United States .\nWithin 12 hours of the attack , President Obama disparaged lax gun laws , Donald Trump tweeted about radical Islamic terrorism , and gay and lesbian celebrities decried a hate crime that took the lives of 49 people at a popular gay nightclub .\nIn the days since the attack , it has become increasingly clear that the actions of Omar Mateen did not fit into a single category of hate crime , mass shooting , or jihadist terror .\n\u201c I would call it a hate crime . I would call it terrorism . It \u2019 s both , \u201d said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Ronald Hopper on Wednesday .\nThe question for federal officials now is : How should they respond ?\nOrlando is further evidence that the nature of terrorism in the US is changing , making the job of federal investigators harder .\nThe Islamic State , in particular , is less concerned with strategic goals than simply spreading fear as widely as possible . It preys on any disgruntled Muslim angry enough to pick up a gun .\nIt doesn \u2019 t require them to go to Syria for training . It doesn \u2019 t require them to talk to jihadists online for instructions . It doesn \u2019 t require them even to know how to build bombs ; guns will suffice .\nFederal agencies are coping with this evolving threat . But the fact that Mateen was investigated twice by the FBI but not stopped speaks to vulnerabilities . Without more resources to cope with an exploding caseload , federal agencies will be hard-pressed to do more .\nFor this reason , the ultimate solution lies in fixing the issues in American society that are giving rise to lone wolf terrorists , some say .\nThere have been signs this was coming . \u201c The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here , to worrying about people in the United States , \u201d said then-Attorney General Eric Holder to ABC News in 2010 . \u201c You didn \u2019 t worry about this even two years ago \u2013 about individuals , about Americans , to the extent that we now do . \u201d\nWhat 's made the issue much more urgent is the rise of Islamic State and its approach to terrorism . While Al Qaeda aimed at winning the hearts and minds of Muslims , the Islamic State is determined to scare them \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 into submission .\n\u201c Most people , al-Qaeda \u2019 s leaders among them , can \u2019 t imagine that political success could come from enraging the masses rather than charming them , \u201d wrote William McCants , a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , in a Politico article last year .\nSince the goal is pure terror , there 's no need for spectacular , highly planned attacks like 9/11 . Any act of mass violence will do . Proper training is no longer a must , only the will to commit violence .\n\u201c The biggest change in terrorism since 9/11 is the jihadists \u2019 embrace of mass shootings , \u201d Mr. McCants writes in an e-mail . \u201c They , like many other terrorists , used to be fixated on building bombs . But they \u2019 ve learned that mass shootings are easier to organize without detection and generate just as much media attention . ISIS has been exceptionally good at inspiring young men to carry out these attacks in its name . \u201d\nMateen , an American citizen born to Afghan parents in New York , offers a picture of the difficulties in sniffing out such terrorists .\nThe FBI put him on a watch list in May 2013 after he made comments to coworkers claiming he had family and friends affiliated with Hezbollah and Al Qaeda . ( That seemed unlikely since the two groups are enemies . )\nAgents interviewed him twice before closing the investigation in March 2014 with too little evidence , according to FBI Director James Comey .\nMateen again came to their attention shortly afterward when the agency found he attended the same mosque as a Syrian suicide bomber . Again , the investigation was closed when the agency found \u201c no ties of consequence , \u201d according to Director Comey .\nSo , two years later , when Mateen walked into the St. Lucie ( Fla. ) Shooting Center to purchase a semiautomatic rifle and pistol , it raised no flags . He had the valid licenses . He passed the background check .\nThe owner of a different local gun store , however , says that his employees refused to sell Mateen body armor and bulk ammunition after he began asking `` suspicious '' questions , according to ABC News . Robert Abell of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach , Fla. , says he contacted authorities about Mateen before the massacre ; the FBI did not respond to ABC News 's request for comment .\nIn its defense , the FBI notes that it is already stepping up antiterror efforts . As of last fall , there were some 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers who live in the United States , according to the report from George Washington University \u2019 s Program on Extremism . Last year , officials arrested 56 of them , the highest number of terror-related arrests in any year since the 9/11 terror attacks .\nYet the FBI has to walk a fine line , says Seamus Hughes , deputy director of the program and coauthor of the report . The FBI investigates thousands of potential domestic terrorists at any given time , the vast majority of whom never plan a terrorist act .\nFrances Townsend , who served as Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush , worries that the current guidelines for domestic counterterror investigations may constrain investigators .

Shooting Center to purchase a semiautomatic rifle and pistol, it raised no flags. He had the valid licenses. He passed the background check.\n\nThe owner of a different local gun store, however, says that his employees refused to sell Mateen body armor and bulk ammunition after he began asking \"suspicious\" questions, according to ABC News. Robert Abell of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Fla., says he contacted authorities about Mateen before the massacre; the FBI did not respond to ABC News's request for comment.\n\nHow the FBI is responding\n\nIn its defense, the FBI notes that it is already stepping up antiterror efforts. As of last fall, there were some 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers who live in the United States, according to the report from George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Last year, officials arrested 56 of them, the highest number of terror-related arrests in any year since the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nYet the FBI has to walk a fine line, says Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the program and coauthor of the report. The FBI investigates thousands of potential domestic terrorists at any given time, the vast majority of whom never plan a terrorist act.\n\nDeciding where to draw those lines is difficult.\n\nFrances Townsend, who served as Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush, worries that the current guidelines for domestic counterterror investigations may constrain investigators. Specifically, she says they harm agents\u2019 ability to include social media activity and postings in their investigations.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we don\u2019t let the attorney general\u2019s guidelines become what \u2018the wall\u2019 was to 9/11,\u201d said Ms. Townsend, referring to the firewall preventing the sharing of information among intelligence agencies that existed before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nBut even if everything works, there\u2019s an element of guesswork in figuring out who will move from being a mere sympathizer to taking up arms. \u201cIn most cases the motivations are complicated,\u201d says Mr. Hughes at George Washington University. \u201cPeople are complex and they do things for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true for Mateen, who proclaimed allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the shooting and often angrily denounced gays to friends and family, but also frequently attended the gay nightclub he attacked, according to reports.\n\nAddressing the rising lone wolf threat isn\u2019t just a matter of what can and can\u2019t be done in an investigation but will almost certainly entail additional resources, said Ms. Townsend.\n\n\u201cThe question is, if we want the FBI to cover more threats, do we give the FBI more resources, more agents?\u201d she asked in a conference call with reporters Monday.\n\nLooking beyond law enforcement\n\nOthers suggest that the answers could lie beyond law enforcement alone.\n\nMany lone wolf terrorists are driven to suicide for the same reasons that ordinary people are, as they try to cope with depression and marital strife, argues Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminology professor and author of a 2013 book, \u201cThe Myth of Martyrdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Orlando shooter and many mass shooters fall within this demographic and seek to die, even when they claim to be \u2018martyrs\u2019 or attempt to hide their psychological pain,\u201d says Mr. Lankford, via e-mail. \u201cIf we can make major progress on reducing suicides and helping people with suicidal thoughts, that would be an incredibly important step for America, and I believe a side effect would be a reduction in mass shootings.\u201d\n\nAnother option is a comprehensive preventative approach to radicalization, argues Hughes of George Washington University. \u201cYou have a number of cases where there\u2019s not enough evidence to prosecute, but the FBI is still concerned about the individual.\u201d\n\nThat would mean targeted intervention from other groups than law enforcement.
