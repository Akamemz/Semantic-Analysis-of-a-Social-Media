The nonprofits faced fines starting Wednesday , the first day of 2014 , if they failed to meet the requirement . Justice Sotomayor 's order halts those fines pending a government response , due by Friday , and further developments in the case .\nThe decision on whether to grant a stay fell to Justice Sotomayor because she is the Supreme Court justice overseeing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver .\nEarly on , the Obama administration said it would exempt churches that objected to the requirement , and in 2013 it offered an additional compromise for nonprofit religiously affiliated groups such as schools and hospitals .
