Heller , a brief was filed from the eighth floor of the Price Daniel Sr. State Office Building in Austin , Texas , specifically from the corner office of the man who was then the state \u2019 s solicitor general , Ted Cruz .\nThe brief took a strong stance on the divisive question of whether the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to own guns , or just protects state and local militias . The brief argued forcefully for the first view , writing that \u201c the individual right to keep and bear arms \u201d is a \u201c fundamental right \u201d and that \u201c an individual right that can be altogether abrogated is no right at all. \u201d Thirty attorneys general from other states signed on .\nToday , with the White House pushing new gun restrictions and Cruz 's candidacy riding on next month 's Iowa caucuses , it 's no surprise that the Texas Republican would embrace gun rights as a defining issue , holding an event at a firing range and even raffling off an engraved 12-gauge shotgun as a campaign promotion .\nIn 2008 , the situation was very different : he was wading into a case that had no immediate connection to Texas at all . But to see the signature of R. Ted Cruz on the brief would not have surprised the nine Supreme Court justices in the least . By that time , Cruz had been solicitor general for five years , and inserting himself into a case of wide prominence and importance regardless of any direct tie to Texas had become part of his playbook . He clearly saw the Heller case as a watershed in gun rights , writing that it would \u201c determine whether the Second Amendment has any modern relevance. \u201d And he was right . The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision shot down the Washington , D.C. , handgun ban and ruled for the first time in the history of this country that the amendment ensures an individual person \u2019 s right to have a gun for self-defense . The National Rifle Association recognized Cruz \u2019 s role with a resolution .\nAs Cruz climbs to the top of the Republican presidential field , the five-plus years he served as the solicitor general of Texas remain the most important period in his public r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . They \u2019 re the record he ran on when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012\u2014and they represent significantly more of his working life than the three years he has served so far in the Senate . They 're also a prime source of fodder for liberal and moderate critics , should be become the Republican presidential nominee .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of Cruz \u2019 s record as solicitor general shows he used the role in a new and far more ideological way than his predecessors , taking a relatively low-profile job that had traditionally been used mostly to defend the state government and turning it into a stage for pushing national conservative causes . Cruz argued eight cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014far more than his predecessors and successors\u2014using each of them to advance a position endorsed by conservative thinkers . He also was the counsel of record on some 70 friend-of-the-court briefs , or amicus briefs , weighing in on cases across the country , like Heller , in which Texas had no direct stake , but which similarly offered a chance to argue ideological points .\n\u201c He really turned the office into a platform , \u201d David Bernstein , a George Mason law professor who recently wrote a book about the Obama administration for which Cruz wrote the foreword , said in an interview .\n\u201c He built up the national aura of the office , \u201d said Tom Phillips , who was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Texas at the start of Cruz \u2019 s run as solicitor general .\nCruz \u2019 s zealous work served the ambitions of the conservative movement , but he also personally used it to build a bridge between what he was ( an elite constitutional law nerd ) to what he is today ( an ascendant right-wing politician ) . Yet while pleasing to conservatives , other aspects of his record are sure to attract critics . He argued against leniency for an unjustly sentenced man whose lawyer had made a technical mistake ; he invoked 13th-century \u201c Saxon law \u201d and the practice of cutting off testicles to justify harsher punishments in a rape case ; and he referred to a late-term abortion technique as \u201c infanticide . \u201d\nAlthough little examined in the race so far , Cruz \u2019 s time as solicitor general built him a powerful allegiance among the conservative donors necessary to launch a national campaign . Heading into Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and beyond , he has more money at his disposal than any candidate besides Jeb Bush . And the way he used that Texas office is part of the reason . Toby Neugebauer , who wrote a $ 10 million check to the Cruz super PAC called Keep the Promise II , told me the reason he did that\u2014the single reason\u2014is what Cruz did as solicitor general .
