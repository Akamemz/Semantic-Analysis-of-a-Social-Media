    "content": "Robby Mook has been spending a lot of time on the phone .\nThe all-but-announced campaign manager for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s all-but-certain presidential campaign has spent the past month making calls , including to many top people from President Barack Obama \u2019 s two campaigns and his White House , asking for advice on whom to hire and how to run the campaign .\nDespite widespread assumptions that Clinton has assembled a campaign juggernaut ready to be unveiled as soon as she makes her White House run official , the reality is that she has little more than a budding operation that \u2019 s far from set \u2014 either in how the jobs will be structured or who will be in them .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a common misconception that there was some sort of campaign-in-waiting . They are building this deliberately and smartly \u2014 one piece at a time , \u201d said a Democrat familiar with the process .\nThe integration of Obama \u2019 s and Clinton \u2019 s worlds will be propelled by people with both Clinton and Obama ties for the jobs of chairman ( John Podesta ) , communications chief ( Jennifer Palmieri ) and campaign consultant ( Jim Margolis ) . Mook has also been looking to Obama alumni for top press , political , field and data jobs \u2014 and not just his close friend Marlon Marshall , a Clinton 2008 staffer who later joined the Obama orbit and departed the White House late last year on what was seen as a natural trajectory toward Clinton HQ .\nObama loyalists who have been part of , or the subject of , hiring discussions for the campaign and advisory roles include Betsy Hoover , Obama \u2019 s 2012 director of digital organizing , who could head up Clinton \u2019 s digital operation . While White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz is being discussed as a later , post-primary addition , former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor , who helped the Clinton camp with June 2014 \u2019 s book rollout , is also frequently part of the discussions . And Yohannes Abraham , currently a top aide to Valerie Jarrett , is seen as joining the political staff .\nOther operatives who have featured in conversations among Democrats building the campaign include first lady Michelle Obama \u2019 s former communications director Kristina Schake , who is currently the chief communications officer at L \u2019 Or\u00e9al USA and who is seen as headed for a deputy role on the communications team . Matt Canter , the former deputy executive director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , who has no direct Obama ties , could also join down the road .\nObama 2012 pollster John Anzalone has been active in Clinton \u2019 s circles , and two more top 2012 campaign officials \u2014 deputy campaign managers Stephanie Cutter and Jen O \u2019 Malley Dillon , who co-founded Precision Strategies \u2014 have also been part of the ongoing discussions for advisory roles .\nMook has essentially been putting markers on prospective staff to keep them accessible as he holds off on formal hires . In the meantime , he \u2019 s building an operation to grapple with the unique problems a Clinton campaign poses , including reassembling the biggest network of old Democratic hands since her husband \u2019 s presidency while limiting dysfunction and infighting . He also needs to keep Clinton vibrant in the midst of the least competitive non-incumbent presidential primary in decades .\n\u201c They \u2019 re being extremely thoughtful and deliberate in their approach , \u201d said one person involved . \u201c But it \u2019 s a process , and there \u2019 s a lot of work left to do . \u201d\nAlready , two themes are becoming clear : The Clinton campaign , determined to avoid the 2008 mistake of being caught unprepared for the changes in politics and campaign tactics , will rely heavily on Obama alumni to get it up to speed . And between the Obama infusion and the Clinton loyalists quickly returning to the fold , there will be few prominent slots open for up-and-coming Democratic operatives looking to break in .\nThat \u2019 s created more than just anxiety that the Obama-Clinton drama of 2008 will linger \u2014 it \u2019 s also created fear that a new generation of Democratic operatives will be left out of the 2016 cycle entirely .\nThe staff overlap may also complicate efforts to show a necessary distance between Clinton from Obama \u2014 and it \u2019 s already sparked worries that the Clinton operation might repeat some of the Obama operation \u2019 s mistakes , particularly in messaging that \u2019 s often fallen short when not centered on the force of his personality .\nThe highest-ranking Obama confidant likely to enter Clinton \u2019 s orbit is pollster Joel Benenson , though some see a more direct role for Obama \u2019 s 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina . He \u2019 s the co-chair of the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action , where Obama \u2019 s 2012 get-out-the-vote director Buffy Wicks is now the executive director . There \u2019 s also Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart , veterans of both Obama campaigns who are backing Ready for Hillary through their firm 270 Strategies . Obama \u2019 s 2012 digital director Teddy Goff has also been in talks with Clinton \u2019 s orbits , and he could be joined by Andrew Bleeker , an Obama online advertising strategist .\nMook did not respond to a request for comment , and none of the potential hires \u2014 some of whom have spoken directly with Mook \u2014 would comment about their possible roles in the emerging campaign .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to stick to my rule of no name-gaming , \u201d said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill .\nDespite the fact that few of these people have been hired for set roles , Mook\u2014the rare Democratic operative who \u2019 s young and experienced but without direct Obama ties \u2014 is working to build a structure that coheres , though many figures on both sides acknowledge some tension between the two worlds remains .
