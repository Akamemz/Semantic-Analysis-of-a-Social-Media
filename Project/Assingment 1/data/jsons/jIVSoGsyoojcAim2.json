He joked that one questioner who quizzed him on the economy could be his Treasury secretary . He cracked that he 'd like to be buddies with actor Ben Affleck . He compared the U.S. debt to the ransoms demanded by Dr . Evil in the Austin Powers movies and encouraged locals to persuade popular New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski to come stump for him . All the while , Bush campaign advisers beamed at their boss 's newfound energy and reporters openly wondered whether he 'd chugged Red Bull before showing up .\n`` Live free or die , brothers and sisters ! '' Jeb exclaimed as he wrapped up his Rye appearance in a spare , spacious wooden bar jammed with prospective voters .\nThe events marked the start of a three-day New Hampshire swing that Bush advisers concede is an attempted comeback for the governor , a one-time frontrunner who 's plummeted so far in the polls that he 's been forced to explain that he 's not planning to quit the race .\nEvidence of his campaign 's infirmity was everywhere , even as a light-hearted Bush bantered with voters .\nThe first state legislator to greet Bush as he stepped off his campaign bus , Doug Thomas , said that Bush would n't be his first choice in the GOP primary . `` Or second . Or third . '' The Bush name , he said , had grown tiresome to New Hampshire , which craves new blood in politics .\nState Sen. Russell Prescott , who supports Bush , agreed that the Bush name has a branding problem , one that he said would take time to overcome .\n`` People will change their mind once they know who Jeb is , '' he said .\nBut it will take a considerable amount of persuading .

Donald Trump and Ben Carson , meanwhile , are tied for first place , with nearly 50 percent support between them . Bush 's Florida rival , Sen. Marco Rubio , laps Bush several times too , drawing 14 percent support , and he 's tied with Texas Sen.

And Governor Bush is working hard , as is every other candidate , to try to get out and answer your questions , '' he said .\nAnd so he did . Bush fielded questions about why women are sometimes excluded from pharmaceutical studies ( Bush said he did n't believe the questioner 's point , though reports have noted the disparity ) ; about his decision to give Hillary Clinton a nonpartisan award when he headed the National Constitution Center ( `` the Constitution should n't be a partisan thing '' ) ; and three separate questions about the town of Raymond 's septic tank woes .\nWhen one questioner pleaded with Bush to preserve Obamacare 's protection for people with preexisting conditions , as well as a provision allowing young people to stay on their parent 's health insurance through age 26 , his answer was firm and unequivocal : `` Totally agree . ''\n`` We \u2019 ve actually laid out a plan to replace Obamacare and the two provisions that would be mandated from Washington would be those two , '' he said .\nThroughout it all Bush played several roles : the soothing healer who would unite the country 's warring political factions , the policy wonk who talked about debt and the federal budget as `` numerators '' and `` denominators '' and the principle of `` subsidiarity , '' and the red meat conservative who decried government as `` a parasite .
