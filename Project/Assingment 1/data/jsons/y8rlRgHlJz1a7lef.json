Instead she chose to be an important part of the solution , which she definitely was .\nAs first lady , and more so as senator , being part of the solution was the kind of role she continually fulfilled .\nTo be completely candid , I have expressed my share of criticism over the years for the very person I intend to vote for . Some of that criticism was deserved , but again , being completely candid , some criticism was expressed more harshly than I wished , or knew was deserved . I have a sense I am not alone in this regard .\nWhen I think of the numerous challenges confronting our nation , I want a president who is knowledgeable , experienced , articulate and tough . I want a president who knows the world and its leaders , the Congress and the White House , and has an innate understanding of the challenges facing everyday Americans .\nAnd I want a president who will attract thoughtful and talented people to work in her administration , and who will continually seek the support of both Democrats and Republicans . By working with all Americans , Clinton will ensure the inspired efforts of our Founding Fathers -- who toiled unceasingly to create a Constitution designed to enable a diverse people , through the art of compromise , to find common ground -- were not in vain .\nWhile no candidate is perfect and while nothing is certain , I am convinced that Hillary Clinton has what it takes to make our government truly work as our Founding Fathers intended .
