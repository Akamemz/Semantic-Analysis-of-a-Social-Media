Some of the posts claim that Sanders said he proposed a 52 % tax raise at the ninth Democratic debate , hosted on February 19 , 2020 in Las Vegas , Nevada . Some posts claim the reason for this hike is to finance another one of Sanders ' signature policies , Medicare for All , a single-payer national health insurance plan ( as referenced berniesanders.com/issues/ ) .\nA full transcript here of the debate here shows that \u201c $ 29,000 \u201d was only said twice , by former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg . There were no instances of anybody saying \u201c 52 % \u201d . Buttigieg 's comments on Sanders ' alleged proposed tax increase on incomes above $ 29,000 is likely part of the inspiration for the claim made on social media .\nButtigieg first scrutinized Sanders \u2019 alleged plan to raise taxes for incomes above $ 29,000 . Around the 37-minute mark of the debate ( as seen in the video here ) , Buttigieg said :\n\u201c But I \u2019 m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders \u2019 personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan , since he \u2019 s said that it \u2019 s impossible to even know how much it \u2019 s going to cost , and even after raising taxes on everybody making $ 29,000 , there is still a multi-trillion-dollar hole . \u201d\nIn the last half hour of the debate , Buttigieg refers here again to this figure while making remarks similar to those earlier in the debate .

Premiums would be eliminated . / BUTTIGIEG : But you \u2019 re still raising those taxes . And when you do it ... / SANDERS : But we \u2019 re saving people money because they don \u2019 t pay any premiums , out-of-pocket expenses , co-payments , or deductibles . They \u2019 re going to be much better off . / BUTTIGIEG : But where is \u2014 where is the other $ 25 trillion supposed to come from ?

The memo , Options to Finance Medicare for All , discusses different tax proposals to finance his healthcare program , not all mentioned during the debate .\nIn the memo , one option here proposed is a progressive income tax schedule that includes a 52 % tax rate , but strictly applied to incomes over $ 10 million .\nAnother option proposed is the so-called \u201c payroll tax \u201d that Sanders mentioned in the debate .
