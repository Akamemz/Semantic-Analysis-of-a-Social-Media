The prisoner \u2019 s dilemma is usually described as follows . Two prisoners are facing medium sentences , let \u2019 s say five years each .

The prisoner who turns evidence will be rewarded with a three-year reduction in his sentence .\nWhat each prisoner realizes is that regardless of what the other does , it \u2019 s worth it to snitch . If the other keeps quiet , snitching will reduce your sentence from five years to two . And if the other does snitch , you can reduce your sentence from ten years to seven .
