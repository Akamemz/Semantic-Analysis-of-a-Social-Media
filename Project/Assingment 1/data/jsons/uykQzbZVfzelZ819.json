In particular, an increasing number of proposals have looked for ways to expand Social Security to extend larger benefits to some recipients, especially those in demographic groups who have greater financial needs.\n\nSen.

Warren's strategy would make major changes to Social Security, boosting benefits for all and imposing new taxes on high-income earners to finance them.\n\nIs Social Security going bankrupt?:3 facts most people get wrong on retirement income\n\nWhy Warren's looking at Social Security\n\nWarren's proposal focuses on the financial straits that many Social Security recipients are in right now. According to her numbers, more than 7 million senior citizens live under the poverty line. With costs of living on the rise, especially in key areas for seniors like health care, it's hard to make ends meet.
