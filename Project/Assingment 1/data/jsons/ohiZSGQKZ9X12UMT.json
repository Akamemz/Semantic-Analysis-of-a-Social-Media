The blogger , a psychiatrist who goes by \u201c Scott Alexander \u201d ( his first and middle names ) , says he went offline out of concern for his personal safety and that of his psychiatric patients . In an email , Alexander told me he had not heard from the Times since deleting his blog on June 23 .\nSlate Star Codex is part of the canon of the \u201c rationalist \u201d community \u2014 a group of academics and technologists who aim to maximize the accuracy of their beliefs by testing them using Bayesian methods . The rationalist emphasis on unbiased empirical analysis often leads them into dangerous territory : In a 2015 post on feminism , Alexander argued that the gender earnings gap is the result of women \u2019 s professional and educational choices , rather than misogyny ; elsewhere , he has suggested that the British Empire had positive effects on its colonial subjects and that certain ethnic groups may have inherently higher IQs than others .\nThe attempted \u201c doxxing \u201d of Scott Alexander is only the latest attempt by the mainstream media to proscribe the limits of public discourse . Because Alexander does not rely on publishers or advertisers , he can grapple with questions that academics and popular writers wouldn \u2019 t touch with a ten-foot pole . But Times tech correspondent Cade Metz seemed to have found a way around this \u2014 not only by threatening to print Alexander \u2019 s name but also by writing a story about \u201c the overlap between SSC and the Y Combinator/Andreessen-Horowitz crowd , \u201d a reference to two prominent venture-capital firms . But wait : Neither Y Combinator ( YC ) nor Andreessen-Horowitz ( a16z ) funds or otherwise supports Slate Star Codex . Alexander says that while YC founder Paul Graham reads his blog , he \u201c can not remember ever meeting or conversing with anyone \u201d affiliated with YC . And outside of self-help clickbait ( \u201c Nine Books Warren Buffett Thinks You Should Read This Year \u201d ) , the reading habits of businesspeople rarely make headlines .\nWhat , then , is the \u201c overlap \u201d to which Metz refers ? Like Alexander , Graham and Marc Andreessen make the mistake of deviating from the Times bestseller list and reading unapproved literature . As technologists with money on the line , they are subject to objective standards of accuracy in their thinking and work . It is not enough for them to be popular ; they have to be correct . Unsurprisingly , they sometimes run afoul of polite orthodoxy . The \u201c overlap \u201d stems from their shared independence .\nGraham , an early investor in Airbnb , Stripe , and Dropbox , has been through the wringer before . In a 2013 Atlantic article titled \u201c Paul Graham Proves Sexism in Tech Is Still a Problem , \u201d he was tarred and feathered for pointing out that young women , on the whole , tend to be less interested than young men in computer science . Never mind that Graham suggested reforming primary-school curricula to encourage more women to go into technology . By pointing out an observable fact that cut against the media narrative on sexism in Silicon Valley , he undermined the legitimacy of journalists whose work depends on the menace of discrimination . They were not going to let him get away with it .\nAndreessen , too , has faced accusations of thought crime . In 2018 , he recommended books by conservatives Douglas Murray and Jordan Peterson to his Twitter followers , recommendations that journalist Eoin Higgins called the \u201c first cogent hint of his rightward tilt. \u201d In a piece for The Outline , Higgins reported that Andreessen had favorited posts by conservatives and members of the \u201c intellectual dark web. \u201d Andreessen , a one-time Democrat who switched parties to support Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 campaign , was deemed \u201c alt-right adjacent . \u201d\nJournalists used to be news brokers , acting as middlemen between those who created the news ( politicians , businesspeople , etc . ) and those who consumed it .
