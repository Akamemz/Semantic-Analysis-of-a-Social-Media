They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are . They \u2019 re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past , not the future . They can \u2019 t figure out how to invest in the future , so they cut everything . You know , laying off , you know , young researchers , closing labs instead of saying , we \u2019 re better at this than anybody in the world , that \u2019 s where our money should go . They just have a backward-looking view of America . And they play on people \u2019 s fears , not on people \u2019 s hopes , and they have to be rejected . I don \u2019 t care what they call themselves . I don \u2019 t care where they \u2019 re from . They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally unAmerican . \u201d\nThis is not the first time she has described sectors of the American electorate as \u201c unAmerican. \u201d At a September fundraiser earlier this year , Clinton described Trump supporters as \u201c deplorable , \u201d and \u201c irredeemable , but thankfully they are not America , \u201d Clinton said .\nDuring her Goldman Sachs speech , Clinton went on to argue that being \u201c American \u201d is not a national identity , but rather is \u201c an intellectual invention . \u201d\n\u201c American was an invention , \u201d Clinton declared . \u201c It was an intellectual invention , and we have done pretty well for all these years . And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are . And we can \u2019 t let them do that . So it \u2019 s not just about politics or partisanship . It really goes to the heart of what it means to be American . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s declaration seems to echo a sentiment that has been expressed by mass migration enthusiast Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan .\nPaul Ryan , like Clinton , has previously suggested that America is not a country or a national identity , but is rather an intellectual idea .\n\u201c America is more than just a country , \u201d Ryan said just a few months before Clinton delivered her speech to Goldman Sachs . \u201c It \u2019 s more than Chicago , or Wisconsin . It \u2019 s more than our borders . America is an idea . It \u2019 s a very precious idea . \u201d\nRyan \u2019 s statement came as he was stumping for the Rubio-Schumer immigration agenda in 2013 with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez , who has since endorsed Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump .
