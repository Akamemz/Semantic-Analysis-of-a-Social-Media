The grudging move followed weeks of the President politicizing and undermining government advice on face coverings .

Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx -- are currently expected to join Trump 's Tuesday briefing , a person familiar with the plan told CNN , but cautioned that could change .\nFive months into the worst domestic crisis since World War II , and after his disastrous call to open up states that had not yet purged the disease sparked a surge of infections , the President may finally be understanding that his performance during the pandemic will be decisive in November 's election .
