    "content": "Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night , as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W. Bush \u2019 s legacy , trading insults at a rapid clip \u2013 and the two Cuban-American senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each other \u2019 s Spanish-speaking skills .\nAnd just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other , the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessman \u2019 s pro-life credentials .\n\u201c You are the single biggest liar . You \u2019 re probably worse than Jeb Bush , \u201d Trump said .\nCruz stood his ground , charging that Trump would \u201c appoint liberals \u201d to the Supreme Court if elected .\nThe issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS News-hosted debate in Greenville , S.C. , in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia \u2019 s death , with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election . Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmation .\nBut the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race , as the candidates charge into next week \u2019 s critical South Carolina primary . The clashes left Ohio Gov . John Kasich \u2013 the affable , second-place finisher in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 making an appeal for peace in the GOP field , albeit one unlikely to be heeded .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don \u2019 t stop this , \u201d Kasich said .\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , too , warned about the coming general election and said , \u201c We can not be tearing each other down . \u201d\nThe appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration . It \u2019 s an argument they \u2019 ve had before \u2013 Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status , and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort \u2013 but this time , it became more heated . And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldn \u2019 t rescind President Obama \u2019 s immigration executive orders on day one , Rubio quipped :\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn \u2019 t speak Spanish , \u201d Rubio said .\nCruz , then , immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish . Rubio continued , saying Cruz \u201c lies about all sorts of things \u201d and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrants .\nAs the Rubio-Cruz battle heated up , so did the long-simmering feud between Trump and Bush .\n\u201c This is a man who insults his way to the nomination , \u201d Bush said of Trump .\nWith Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire , Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before \u2013 boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audience .\nThe audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush , though Trump once again accused them of representing Bush \u2019 s \u201c special interests and lobbyists . \u201d\nTheir most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the U.S. mired more deeply in the Middle East \u2013 and blamed the former Florida governor \u2019 s brother for the problems there .\nTrump initially took issue with Jeb Bush \u2019 s call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syria \u2019 s Bashar Assad and sidelining Russia .\n\u201c Jeb is so wrong , \u201d Trump said . \u201c You have to knock out ISIS . .... You decide what you have to do after . You can \u2019 t fight two wars at one time . \u201d\nBush , though , said Russia is not a U.S. ally , and Assad \u2019 s hold on power prevents a resolution in the war . Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W. Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place , calling it a \u201c big fat mistake \u201d that \u201c destabilized the Middle East . \u201d\n\u201c I am sick and tired of him going after my family , \u201d Jeb Bush countered , saying he \u2019 s proud of his brother \u2019 s efforts to keep the country safe .\nTrump then invoked 9/11 : \u201c The World Trade Center came down \u2026 That \u2019 s not keeping us safe . \u201d\nRubio , who has often been at odds with Bush , leapt to his brother \u2019 s defense , saying the Bush administration \u201c kept us safe . \u201d\nJeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trump \u2019 s invitation to an upcoming rally with George W. Bush on the campaign trail .\nThe fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note , discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will have .\nSeveral candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy , and wait for the next president to make that decision .
