Alonzo Wright Jr. knows Georgia has not yet met the guidelines laid out by the White House to safely lift stay-at-home orders . The state isn \u2019 t even close , really . And so when the decision to reopen his Beastmode Fitness came , he had a realization . He would clean . He would expand to create more space for social distancing . But he wouldn \u2019 t reopen , not yet .\nAfter Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp said businesses could start to reopen this weekend , the Peach State offered a taste of what America might look like when it emerges from its coronavirus lockdowns . \u201c I \u2019 m excited and , yes , I \u2019 m nervous , \u201d says the owner of The Crab Shack , capturing the atmosphere around Savannah .\nFor starters , the restaurant will have about 300 seats , not the usual 700-plus . The breezes that blow through the screened-in windows will hopefully offer plenty of circulation . And all the servers , of course , will have masks and gloves . But make no mistake , The Crab Shack is preparing to open Monday .\nOne day the parking lot of Nottingham Plaza off Skidaway Road was empty \u2013 as it had been for nearly five long weeks of a pandemic lockdown .\nThen the next day , on Friday , at 11:13 a.m. , cars appeared \u2013 lots of them . \u201c Like a regular summer day , \u201d one shopkeeper observed .\nThis weekend , Georgia began rolling back stay-at-home coronavirus restrictions in hopes of restarting the U.S. economy . And Nottingham Plaza ZYS Hair Studio owner LaZharia Morris could palpably feel the stakes \u2013 for her customers , for her stylists , and for a thriving business she grew from the ground up .\nAs appointments flooded in , Ms. Morris scrambled to manage expectations and check off a list of requirements put out by the state cosmetology board . Hand-washing and mask-wearing would be required . Importantly , customers are being asked to sign a \u201c hold harmless \u201d waiver so that business owners can \u2019 t be sued if someone becomes ill .\nBefore long , she had to run to Walmart , out of printer ink . As customers flocked in , she realized she needed more waivers , more posters , more information .\nMs. Morris \u2019 harried morning offers a glimpse into how America might begin to reemerge from isolation \u2013 hair askew , facing a world where the barber makes you sign a contract and where sit-down diners will , for the foreseeable future , be greeted by servers in masks and gloves .\nThe question is how quickly it should happen . In beginning to reopen , Georgia defied White House guidelines , which call for , among other things , declining COVID-19 cases for 14 days and a robust testing system . Georgia has neither .\nBut there are signs of restlessness in some parts of the country . In the South , other states are beginning to reopen . An anti-lockdown protest brought thousands to Madison , Wisconsin , this weekend . And in Southern California , some beaches were crowded .\nIn coastal Georgia , the mood was one of buzzy excitement . For Ms. Morris , this weekend marked a return to clarity and purpose after weeks of wandering through a kind of fog .\n\u201c My boyfriend is an entrepreneur , too \u2013 he owns a recording studio \u2013 and he was begging me not to reopen , but I told him , \u2018 I \u2019 ve got six ladies here who have mouths to feed and rents to pay. \u2019 I \u2019 m not going to say the governor is stupid . We needed this . This virus isn \u2019 t going away . We have to learn to live with it at some point . We \u2019 ve got to do what we \u2019 ve got to do . \u201d\nThe decision is a controversial one , among some here and certainly in other parts of the United States . The concern is that the desire to return to something like normal could undo the gains made by social distancing .\nIndeed , health officials say that until there is a vaccine or an effective means of treatment , social distancing is the only viable medical path . A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington suggests Georgia should begin reopening after June 22 .\n\u201c The ethical issue here isn \u2019 t a question of right and wrong \u2013 as it usually isn \u2019 t \u2013 but how do you balance two competing rights ? \u201d asks Paul Root Wolpe , a bioethicist at Emory University in Atlanta , referring to health and economic welfare . \u201c We have to decide which one we \u2019 re going to favor \u2013 and when . \u201d\nThose choices are playing out on both sides at Nottingham Plaza . From the outside , it \u2019 s just another nondescript L-shaped strip mall on an urban fringe in America . But behind mirrored shop doors , whole worlds are coming back to life .\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Alonzo Wright Jr. sits on a bench at Beastmode Fitness , his Savannah , Georgia , gym , on April 24 , 2020 , the day hard-hit Georgia began to reopen select businesses amid the coronavirus crisis .

''\nAt 11:33 a.m. on Friday , all eight chairs are occupied at Fatou \u2019 s , an African hair-braiding shop . In the tattoo shop next door , A Fifth of Ink , the owner is cautiously reopening \u2013 by appointment only at first , but already with customers in chairs .\nYet as his plaza colleagues rush to open , Alonzo Wright Jr. raises his head as the front door opens at Beastmode Fitness , his gym .\nHe \u2019 s in touch with six local gym owners , and only one opened Friday . After preemptively closing his gym in March , Mr. Wright , newly married , moved into a new house . The idling hours were spent painting walls and otherwise nesting . The gym benches began gathering dust , and for weeks he didn \u2019 t care . But when GOP Gov . Brian Kemp \u201c threw his curveball \u201d last Monday , announcing that businesses could reopen Friday , Mr. Wright returned to the gym and had a realization .\nHe knew Georgia remained far behind on testing and setting up contact tracers to track the spread of the virus . He knew the tension between Mr. Kemp and federal guidelines , and the deadlier impact the virus has had on working-class African American communities . He had soaked up every news detail of the pandemic . Mayors , governors , and the president were openly bickering over a way forward . And here he was , faced with the question of reopening the country \u2013 by opening his gym .\nAs he looked around at the well-worn green carpeting , he saw what he must do : His trainers were already using Zoom and FaceTime to do one-on-one workouts . \u201c I realized that this is something else . It requires bigger thinking . \u201d\nSo he called in his trainer crew \u2013 \u201c the muscle \u201d \u2013 to start moving equipment around . The carpet is coming up , a deep clean commencing . And shortly after noon that day , Mr. Wright \u2019 s attorney appeared to start discussions about expanding the gym into a soon-to-be-vacant unit next door .\n\u201c Each person has to do what they think is right , knowing that you can \u2019 t be mad at any one person , \u201d says Mr. Wright . \u201c I also think that this is part madness . But if I \u2019 m speaking only for myself , we \u2019 re not opening the gym because we \u2019 re just not ready .

Polls released in recent weeks say Americans are wary of reopening too soon . But many American also say they can be responsible if shown a little more trust .\n\u201c This is us playing out over and over again \u2013 the inherent tension in the American psyche of not really being good at understanding and balancing collective sacrifice , \u201d says Dr. Wolpe . \u201c Yes , we do it in war and extreme situations .
