    "content": "NASHVILLE , Tenn. \u2014 The battle for the South has settled into a race between two candidates , and neither is Marco Rubio .\nIn interviews with more than two dozen party officials , political operatives and activists , Ted Cruz and Donald Trump were repeatedly named as front-runners and likely winners in one of the most conservative regions of the country . Both contenders draw huge crowds and appeal to large swaths of middle- and lower-income white Republican Southerners , who are deeply angry with Washington .\nCruz has Trump , and the rest of the field , beat on organization , but Trump still lures the bigger audiences . And there is an increasing acknowledgment , even among the Republican elite , that the billionaire real estate developer has a committed base here , some of whom are likely voters and not the political celebrity gawkers many mainstream GOP operatives have guessed .\n\u201c Amongst a lot of the grass roots , Sen. Cruz is definitely picking up momentum , there \u2019 s no doubt about it , \u201d said Ryan Haynes , the unaligned chairman of the Tennessee GOP .\nWilliamson County GOP Chairman Julie Hannah Taleghani agreed that Cruz and Trump , who have spent significant time in the state , have the most momentum , and noted , `` I have to honestly say , the Trump campaign '' is building an organization as well .\nCertainly , Rubio \u2019 s not out ; a viable path remains here for the candidate , who has spent considerable resources building infrastructure in the South . Rubio has a long list of legislative endorsements in Tennessee , Alabama and elsewhere in the region . Particularly in this more moderate part of Tennessee , many people are torn between Rubio and Cruz .\nBut the feeling on the ground is that Cruz has the momentum with conservative activists and that there \u2019 s some true support behind Trump \u2019 s high poll numbers , much as many party stalwarts wish otherwise . And while Rubio is generating considerable interest among more centrist Republican voters , he \u2019 s being squeezed not just on the right by Cruz but in the moderate lane by Jeb Bush and Chris Christie .\n\u201c Rubio \u2019 s got a lot of names , prominent elected officials ; he \u2019 s the establishment darling right now , \u201d said Chris Brown , a Birmingham , Alabama , consultant who is backing Bush . \u201c But that is not contributing to rank-and-file voters . They are more Cruz-oriented . \u201d\nIn Nashville on Tuesday , Cruz celebrated both his 45th birthday and a new poll that , for the first time , showed him within striking distance of Trump nationally . The Quinnipiac poll released that morning found Trump , the persistent national poll-leader , coming in at 28 percent , with Cruz pulling in 24 percent \u2014 within the margin of error .\n\u201c I did think it was interesting , Donald said a couple of days ago that he felt that the Republican race could come down just to him and me , and I think he may well be right , \u201d Cruz said . \u201c If you look at the polling numbers , we are surging in the polls , and Donald may be right that this is turning more and more into a two-man race between Donald Trump and me . If that \u2019 s the case , the decision will be made by the voters : Who has the experience , the record , who has been the most consistent conservative ? \u201d\nThe event Tuesday afternoon appeared smaller than Cruz \u2019 s rallies over the weekend in Alabama , where he drew crowds of well over a thousand at two separate stops and frequently brought attendees to their feet . But it was not more staid despite being held in relatively more liberal Nashville .\nThe event at times felt like a Christian revival , with Cruz introducing the man who helped him and his father become religious , and many in the room joined in praying for Cruz as he spoke about his faith journey , a move that plays well with deeply observant voters in the South .\nMost of the room remained standing for the entirety of Cruz \u2019 s stump speech , frequently chiming in with applause and remarks like \u201c that \u2019 s right \u201d and \u201c amen . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s Trump who holds the lead , Quinnipiac survey aside , and party leaders say enthusiasm for him on the ground is undeniable .\n\u201c To me , traditional rally folks are not going to be pounding on the doors trying to get in , but that was happening , \u201d Taleghani said of a recent Trump event in nearby Franklin . \u201c These people were there , they stood for hours in the rain , even if they couldn \u2019 t get in , they were still trying to despite the fire marshal [ saying the event was full ] .
