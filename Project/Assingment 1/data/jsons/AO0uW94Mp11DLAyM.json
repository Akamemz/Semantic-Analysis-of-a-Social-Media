It turns out that decades ago , Congress put a cap on two kinds of campaign giving : how much you can donate to individual candidates and committees and how much you can give in total when you add all your donations to various candidates and committees , the so-called aggregate limit .

Somehow , I can give the individual limit , now $ 2,600 , to 17 candidates without corrupting the system . But as soon as I give that same amount to an 18th candidate , our democracy is suddenly at risk . Only politicians in Washington could come up with something so absurd .

Good candidates who aren \u2019 t rich can raise more money and challenge entrenched insiders . Right now , the aggregate limits add to the advantages that incumbents already have in public office . With more time and donors , they amass huge war chests because special interests place their bets on the incumbent waltzing to victory . That \u2019 s a very safe bet , by the way , since roughly 90 percent of incumbents win reelection time and again . It helps those odds that incumbents typically have about half their staff working on their reelection , and that they get a ton of free media throughout their time in office .\nSo how can they ensure elections remain uncompetitive ? How about limiting the amount of money that challengers can get from potential supporters ? Aggregate limits do exactly that because politically active donors donate to incumbents first , long before they even have challengers in the cycle , and it \u2019 s those marginal dollars that aren \u2019 t there when challengers need funds . And while candidates and parties are accountable to voters and are going to be there even after elections , forcing campaign spending away from them and into super PACs creates less accountability .\nThen there \u2019 s the argument that if the aggregate limits are done away with , political candidates will be showered with seven-figure checks through what are called Joint Fundraising Committees .
