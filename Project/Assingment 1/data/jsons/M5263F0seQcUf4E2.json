    "content": "You 'll recall that I spelled out my thoughts on this question in some detail last week , and yesterday I appeared on Fox News with the great Monica Crowley to debate my conclusion . Monica adheres to the school of thought that defunding Obamacare through the looming temporary budget scrap is the last chance Republicans have to stop the law . I disagree , arguing that forcing a government shutdown in an inevitably failed attempt to partially strip the law of funding would actually damage the cause of full repeal :\nHarry Reid will never , ever allow a Continuing Resolution to pass the Senate if it cuts off funding for Obamacare . Remember , Democrats ' goal in the brewing fight is to undo the sequester and increase spending . Cutting Obamacare money is n't even on the table . But even if by some miracle , such a plan narrowly passed the Senate , the president would immediately veto it . And even if he accidentally signed it , that CR would only defund a fraction of the law ; Sen. Tom Coburn recently noted that most of Obamacare 's spending is `` mandatory , '' requiring repeal to undo . While Republicans fought the fruitless `` defund '' fight , liberal Democrats would eagerly merge their Obamacare messaging with their government shut down messaging , muddying the rhetorical waters to deliberately confuse voters . Currently , Republicans have the political high ground on the former issue , but not the latter . Moderate Democrats could also vote against Obamacare defunding and use the threat of shutdown as political cover . Here 's what they could tell voters back home : `` Yes , Obamacare has its flaws , and I 'm in favor of making some adjustments to it , but I voted no because I could n't go along with Republicans ' irresponsible plan to shut down the whole federal government . '' This would be a double-whammy for the GOP . Party-line Democrats could hang the shutdown weight around Republicans ' necks -- thus eroding their long-held advantage on Obamacare -- and vulnerable Democrats could wriggle off the hook . And , again , the ( partial ) `` defund '' strategy is doomed to failure . That 's why I called it a `` high risk , no reward '' proposition during our discussion .\nIn my view , the clearly preferable approach is delay , which enjoys the twin benefits of polling well and being plausible . The public overwhelmingly supports delaying the individual mandate tax , and GOP messaging on security and eligibility verification-related delays practically writes itself . Republicans should also team up with a growing contingent of Congressional Democrats who agree with Howard Dean that the IPAB rationing board must be repealed . Force a vote on these issues . Hold rank-and-file Democrats ' feet to the fire by demanding that they go on the record by voting to obstruct these goals , or let Obama to veto them ( he 'd have no choice , as IPAB is one of the only `` cost containment '' elements of the law ) . If and when that push fails , pummel the bills ' opponents for blocking a bipartisan effort that reflects the will of the people .
