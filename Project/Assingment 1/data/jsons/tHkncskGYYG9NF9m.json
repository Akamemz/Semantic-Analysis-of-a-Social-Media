The risks have already become apparent in places that have n't closed or implemented enough measures to stop the spread .\nAn outbreak has emerged at Tyson Foods pork plant in Waterloo , Iowa , where workers continued business as usual during the pandemic with minimal safety precautions : \u201c As of Thursday , the county health department had recorded 1,031 coronavirus infections among Tyson employees \u2014 more than a third of the workforce .

Three have died , according to Tyson , \u201d the New York Times 's Ana Swanson , David Yaffe-Bellany and Michael Corkery report .\nExpect testing \u2014 and the White House 's access to it \u2014 to be a big issue on the ( mostly virtual ) campaign trail : \u201c The Trump administration could focus on producing and distributing adequate testing and protocols that conform with the guidance of public health experts ; doing so would speed up the reopening process considerably and make it a whole lot more effective , \u201d presumptive Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden writes in an op-ed out this morning for The Post .\n\u201c The administration is fully aware that this is the right path , too \u2014 after all , the president and his staff are now reportedly receiving daily tests , \u201d Biden continued . They knew exactly how to make the Oval Office safe and operational , and they put in the work to do it . They just have n't put in that same work for the rest of us . If Trump and his team understand how critical testing is to their safety \u2014 and they seem to , given their own behavior \u2014 why are they insisting that it 's unnecessary for the American people ? \u201d\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter .

( John McDonnell/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nWHITE HOUSE WARY OF STIMULUS PRICE TAGS : \u201c Senior Trump administration officials are growing increasingly wary of the massive federal spending to combat the economic downturn and are considering ways to limit the impact of future stimulus efforts on the national debt , according to six administration officials and four external advisers familiar with the matter , \u201d Jeff Stein , Josh Dawsey and John Hudson report .\nWhat 's on the table : \u201c Some White House officials have gone as far as exploring policies such as automatic spending cuts as the economy improves , or prepaying Social Security benefits to workers before they become eligible , although these measures are unlikely to advance given the political stakes , said these officials and advisers , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of internal deliberations . \u201d\nThe biggest effect may be on the next phase of stimulus : \u201c House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) has vowed an additional $ 2 trillion package , including hundreds of billions in aid for states , \u201d our colleagues write . \u201c Numerous congressional Democrats have also called for making the $ 1,200 stimulus checks recurring , so they arrive in Americans \u2019 bank accounts every month until the crisis abates . \u201d\nBut some White House advisers are urging a \u201c pause \u201d : \u201c I think that many people would like to just pause for a moment and take a look at the economic impact of this massive assistance program , which is the greatest in United States history , \u201d National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week with George Stephanopoulos , \u201d while pledging to continue conversations with both parties .\nConcerns about deficit are coming from traditional conservatives in the White House : That includes new chief of staff Mark Meadows and acting budget director Russ Vought . But it 's unclear whether Trump will share their concerns , he also promised during the 2016 campaign not to touch Social Security or Medicare .\nSome voters are apparently skeptical that Trump will keep his word : \u201c About 39 percent of voters think Trump is more likely to cut Medicare , while 51 percent say presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is more unlikely to cut their benefits , according to a 17-page Republican National Committee poll shown to the president last month , according to a person with knowledge of its findings , \u201d our colleagues write .\nGEORGIA AG ASKS DOJ TO LOOK INTO ARBERY 'S KILLING : \u201c Ahmaud Arbery \u2019 s fatal shooting in February spurred public outrage last week after video emerged showing the 25-year-old trying to run by a pickup truck with two armed white men , before struggling with them and falling to the ground dead when shots were fired , \u201d Hannah Knowles reports .\nMore details : Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested \u201c Bobby Christine , U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia , lead a \u2018 complete and transparent review of how the Ahmaud Arbery case was handled from the outset , \u2019 \u201d the Atlanta Journal Constitution \u2019 s Christian Boone reports .\nWhat they might be looking into : Glynn County District Attorney Jackie Johnson has faced accusations from two county officials that she stopped officers from making arrests the day Arbery was killed . She has denied those claims . Before retiring one of the armed men , Greg McMichael , worked in Johnson \u2019 s office . ( Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Colby Itkowitz have more details about the case . )\nRemember charges were only filed after the footage went viral : \u201c The Georgia Bureau of Investigation arrested retired police detective Gregory McMichael and his son , Travis , on Thursday on charges of murder and aggravated assault , after the elder McMichael told officers that he pursued Arbery in the belief he was behind neighborhood burglaries , '' our colleague writes .\nSen.

But it \u2019 s also not a forever place . \u201d\nWhere the race stands : \u201c Strategists from both parties said the key battles for Republicans remain races in North Carolina , Arizona , Colorado , Maine and , to a lesser extent , Iowa , \u201d our colleagues write . The GOP 's hope for a lone pickup to pad their slim three-seat majority is in Alabama , where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones faces voters after his shocking special election upset .\nDems are also outpacing Republicans in fundraising : \u201c The first quarter of 2020 was also a boon in fundraising for Democrats , with 10 challengers outraising GOP opponents in seats currently held by Republicans : Alaska , Arizona , Colorado , Georgia , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Montana , North Carolina and South Carolina .

But some hospitals and doctors found that it was turning up too many false negatives \u2014 cases in which people really had the virus, but the test said they did not.\u201d\n\nMore steps coming: \u201cThe president\u2019s physician and White House operations continue to work closely to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the president, first family and the entire White House complex safe and healthy at all times,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere told Power Up last night. \u201cIn addition to social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, hand sanitizer, and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces, every staff member in proximity to the president and vice president is being tested daily for covid-19 as well as any guests.\u201d\n\nThe Friday memo \"also told employees they must quarantine for 14 days if they leave the Washington region and must report all of their travel,\u201d per Seung Min, Josh and Amy.\n\nBut most people in the United States still don't have the ability to test as frequently as White House officials \u2014 and capacity is still below the level that public health experts say is necessary to schools and businesses to reopen. The risks have already become apparent in places that haven't closed or implemented enough measures to stop the spread.\n\nAn outbreak has emerged at Tyson Foods pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa, where workers continued business as usual during the pandemic with minimal safety precautions: \u201c As of Thursday, the county health department had recorded 1,031 coronavirus infections among Tyson employees \u2014 more than a third of the workforce . Some are on ventilators. Three have died, according to Tyson,\u201d the New York Times's Ana Swanson, David Yaffe-Bellany and Michael Corkery report.\n\nExpect testing \u2014 and the White House's access to it \u2014 to be a big issue on the (mostly virtual) campaign trail: \u201cThe Trump administration could focus on producing and distributing adequate testing and protocols that conform with the guidance of public health experts; doing so would speed up the reopening process considerably and make it a whole lot more effective,\u201d presumptive Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden writes in an op-ed out this morning for The Post.\n\n\u201cThe administration is fully aware that this is the right path, too \u2014 after all, the president and his staff are now reportedly receiving daily tests,\u201d Biden continued. They knew exactly how to make the Oval Office safe and operational, and they put in the work to do it. They just haven't put in that same work for the rest of us. If Trump and his team understand how critical testing is to their safety \u2014 and they seem to, given their own behavior \u2014 why are they insisting that it's unnecessary for the American people?\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Johnson report.\n\nHassett said \"nobody knows\" when those who lost their jobs will be able to return to work: \"To get unemployment rates like the ones that we\u2019re about to see . . . which I think will climb up towards 20 percent by next month, you have to really go back to the Great Depression to see that,\u201d he said told Margaret Brennan.\n\nMnuchin argued that the job market should begin to improve by September: When asked by [\u201dFox News Sunday\" host Chris] Wallace whether the country\u2019s unemployment rate was \u201cclose to 25 percent at this point, which is Great Depression neighborhood,\u201d Mnuchin said, \u201cChris, we could be.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and then-incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows depart a meeting on Capitol Hill on March 24.

But it's unclear whether Trump will share their concerns, he also promised during the 2016 campaign not to touch Social Security or Medicare.\n\nSome voters are apparently skeptical that Trump will keep his word: \u201cAbout 39 percent of voters think Trump is more likely to cut Medicare, while 51 percent say presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is more unlikely to cut their benefits, according to a 17-page Republican National Committee poll shown to the president last month, according to a person with knowledge of its findings,\u201d our colleagues write.\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\nGEORGIA AG ASKS DOJ TO LOOK INTO ARBERY'S KILLING: \u201cAhmaud Arbery\u2019s fatal shooting in February spurred public outrage last week after video emerged showing the 25-year-old trying to run by a pickup truck with two armed white men, before struggling with them and falling to the ground dead when shots were fired,\u201d Hannah Knowles reports.\n\nMore details: Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested \u201cBobby Christine, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia, lead a \u2018complete and transparent review of how the Ahmaud Arbery case was handled from the outset,\u2019\u201d the Atlanta Journal Constitution\u2019s Christian Boone reports.\n\nWhat they might be looking into: Glynn County District Attorney Jackie Johnson has faced accusations from two county officials that she stopped officers from making arrests the day Arbery was killed. She has denied those claims. Before retiring one of the armed men, Greg McMichael, worked in Johnson\u2019s office. (Cleve R.

But it\u2019s also not a forever place.\u201d\n\nWhere the race stands: \u201cStrategists from both parties said the key battles for Republicans remain races in North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, Maine and, to a lesser extent, Iowa,\u201d our colleagues write.

Doug Jones faces voters after his shocking special election upset.\n\nDems are also outpacing Republicans in fundraising: \u201cThe first quarter of 2020 was also a boon in fundraising for Democrats, with 10 challengers outraising GOP opponents in seats currently held by Republicans: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, North Carolina and South Carolina.
