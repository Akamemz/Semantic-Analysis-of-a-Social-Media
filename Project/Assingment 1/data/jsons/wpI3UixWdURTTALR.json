    "content": "Even as the Republican establishment continued to call for Representative Todd Akin of Missouri to drop out of his Senate race because of his comments on rape and abortion , Republicans approved platform language on Tuesday calling for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion with no explicit exceptions for cases of rape or incest .\nThe anti-abortion plank , approved by the Republican platform committee Tuesday morning in Tampa , Fla. , was similar to the planks Republicans have included in their recent party platforms , which also called for a constitutional ban on abortions . The full convention is set to vote on the party \u2019 s platform on Monday .\nWhile Republican officials stressed that the plank did not go into granular details , saying that they were better left to the states , the language of the plank seems to leave little room for exceptions to the abortion ban . It states that \u201c the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed . \u201d\n\u201c Faithful to the \u2018 self-evident \u2019 truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence , we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed , \u201d said the draft platform language approved Tuesday , which was first reported by CNN . \u201c We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment \u2019 s protections apply to unborn children . \u201d\nThe timing of the approval of the Republican anti-abortion plank was awkward for Mitt Romney , who has denounced Mr. Akin \u2019 s comments about rape and abortion and who has said that he supports exceptions to allow abortions in cases of rape . And it comes as his selection of his running mate , Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , was already drawing scrutiny for his support for a more absolute ban on abortions , even in cases of rape or incest .\nBut Mr. Romney would hardly be the first Republican nominee at odds with his party \u2019 s more absolute opposition to abortion . Just four years ago , the Republican Party adopted a platform with a similar plank seeking an unconditional ban on abortion , even though its nominee , Senator John McCain of Arizona , had urged the party in the past to allow certain exceptions . George W. Bush also supported outlawing abortion except in cases of rape , incest , or when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger .\nAfter this year \u2019 s abortion plank language was approved with little debate , the chairman of the platform committee , Gov . Bob McDonnell of Virginia , praised the committee for \u201c affirming our respect for human life \u201d and for doing so expeditiously .\nThe Republican platform committee waded into the abortion debate again later on Tuesday when it approved language opposing drugs like RU-486 , which can terminate pregnancies . \u201c We oppose approval of these drugs and similar drugs that terminate innocent human life after conception , \u201d said Mary Summa , a delegate form North Carolina , who introduced a plank calling on the Food and Drug Administration not to approve such drugs .\nA member of the committee from Alabama , Jackie Curtiss , sought clarification that the amendment would not apply to so-called \u201c morning-after \u201d pills , which prevent conception . \u201c In light of the recent comments by Congressman Todd Akin , and in an attempt to reaffirm to the American people the party \u2019 s sensitivity on the subject of rape , I believe that we should not support an amendment which opposes approval of a method that \u2019 s been proven effective in preventing the pregnancy of rape victims , \u201d she said .\nGiven assurance that it did not refer to such morning-after pills , the amendment passed .\nThe party also approved a plank supporting abstinence-only education , as it has in the past .
