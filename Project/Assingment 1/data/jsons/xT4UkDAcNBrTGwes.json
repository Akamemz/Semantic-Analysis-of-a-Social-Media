A Bloomberg Politics poll showed that 65 percent of Republican voters back the ban , and a Rasmussen Reports poll showed support of 66 percent .\nMr. Trump also has surged in overall support for the Republican nomination in a CBS/New York Times poll with 35 percent support \u2014 19 percentage points higher than his closest rival .\nRepublican campaign strategist Jim McLaughlin said Mr. Trump \u2019 s rivals miscalculated when they attacked his plan , underestimating the level of frustration in the electorate with President Obama \u2019 s national security policies .\n\u201c Our base and Republicans in general and a lot of independents and swing voters don \u2019 t trust this president when it comes to their national security right now , \u201d he said . \u201c To some extent , he \u2019 s made them desperate . \u201d\nHe said Mr. Trump \u2019 s plan was ridiculous and likely would never become law .
