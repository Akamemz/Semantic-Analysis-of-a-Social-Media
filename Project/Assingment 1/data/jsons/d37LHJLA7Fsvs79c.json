Obama 's challenge\nPresident Barack Obama has to thread a needle in his speech Wednesday night : addressing an American public increasingly fearful about the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant while trying to offer some perspective on a threat critics say he has long understated .\nNew polls show a majority of Americans now support broadening U.S. military airstrikes against ISIL , also known as ISIS , to combat the threat evident in recently released videotapes showing fighters from the group beheading two American journalists .\nHowever , some analysts believe that the current public sentiment exaggerates the danger posed by ISIL , while others say Obama should not assume that publicity-driven poll numbers equate to long-term commitment by the U.S. populace to a broad campaign against the brutal militant group .\n\u201c You can say panic . It is in the air , \u201d former State Department intelligence official Wayne White said . \u201c It is sort of a vicious cycle in which the media has been relentless in hyping just about anything that happens and politicians have to look responsive to the public and they , of course , become more strident in what they \u2019 re urging and that again inflames the public further . \u201d\nAfter enduring weeks of pressure to outline a comprehensive strategy to fight ISIL , Obama is planning a prime-time speech to announce how a limited U.S. campaign against the group in Iraq will be broadened into a wider effort to defeat the group , possibly by launching American airstrikes in Syria .\nHowever , White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Tuesday continued the cautious line Obama has taken thus far , arguing that some fears of ISIL fighters poised to swarm the U.S. surpass reality .\n\u201c I can state as unequivocally as possible that it is the assessment of the intelligence community \u2014 and this is something that \u2019 s been repeated by senior members of the intelligence community and senior members of our military leadership as well \u2014 that there is no evidence to indicate that ISIL , right now , is actively plotting to hit the homeland , \u201d the press secretary said . \u201c It is important for people to understand that . \u201d\nEven those who view the ISIL threat as a grave one are jittery that the public may view eradicating the group as a goal that can be carried out solely through airstrikes , when the task will require some kind of ground force in addition to political and financial pressure .\n\u201c The public will want some swift action , and airstrikes are almost always the preferred , seeminglyconsequenceless approach , \u201d said Kathleen Hicks , a former Pentagon policy official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies . \u201c The risk is making Americans think this is fast or dealt with decisively in the near term . \u201d\nIn a measure of the pressure Obama is under even from his usual allies , some analysts generally supportive of the president are warning against being too categorical in ruling out ground troops for what could be a lengthy and unpredictable fight .\n\u201c The president should resist using phrases like \u2018 boots on the ground \u2019 or \u2018 ground troops , \u2019 as any effective campaign will require U.S. intelligence and special operations personnel to be deployed on the ground in Iraq , \u201d Shawn Brimley of the Center for New American Security wrote in a news release . \u201c The president should state that extensive deployments of uniformed combat personnel is not something that he is considering , and that such a deployment is exactly what ISIS militants most desire . \u201d\nFor Obama , who has been faulted by members of both parties for being slow to recognize the ISIL threat , the political imperative would seem to push him in the direction of embracing the new public concern and playing up the danger posed by the group .\nThat has not been his record in the past .
