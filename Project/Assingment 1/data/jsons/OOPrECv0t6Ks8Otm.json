Jim DeMint , South Carolina Republican . \u201c Everyone knows that when you take money out of the economy , it destroys jobs , and everyone knows that when you give politicians more money , they spend it . \u201d\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation also dismissed the Republican plan , saying it fails Mr. Boehner \u2019 s own test of seriousness because it doesn \u2019 t do enough to curtail entitlement spending .\nEven as he faces resistance on higher taxes , Mr. Boehner pivoted Tuesday , saying after a bipartisan meeting with House Republican leaders and a handful of governors that spending cuts are crucial to the deal .\n\u201c Yesterday , Republicans made a good-faith offer to avert the fiscal cliff that includes significant spending cuts and new revenue without raising tax rates on small businesses and costing jobs , \u201d Mr. Boehner said .\n\u201c I will continue to urge governors of both parties to talk to small-business men and women in their states about the impact it will have on small businesses if Washington raises their tax rates , as President Obama is demanding , rather than cutting spending and reforming entitlement programs . \u201d\nLed by Mr. Boehner , the House \u2019 s leadership sent a $ 2.2 trillion proposal to the White House on Monday that included $ 900 billion in cuts to entitlement programs and $ 300 billion in lower discretionary spending , but also promised $ 800 billion more in taxes , which aides said would come from eliminating deductions and loopholes claimed by the wealthy .\nThe White House rejected the proposal , saying it doesn \u2019 t believe the Republican numbers add up and noting Mr. Obama will insist that the wealthy pay a higher income tax rate , rather than just have loopholes closed .\n\u201c Unfortunately , the speaker \u2019 s proposal right now is still out of balance , \u201d Mr. Obama said Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview . \u201c You know , he talks , for example , about $ 800 billion worth of revenues , but he says he \u2019 s going to do that by lowering rates . And when you look at the math , it doesn \u2019 t work . \u201d\nRepublicans and Democrats are trying to avoid the fiscal cliff \u2014 the across-the-board tax increases and $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts that will kick in at the beginning of next year if lawmakers can \u2019 t agree on a budget deal . Going over the cliff , many economists predict , would plunge the nation into a short , sharp recession \u2014 but over the long haul , the spending cuts and tax increases would leave the federal government in better fiscal and economic shape , the Congressional Budget Office says .\nLawmakers , though , want to minimize the pain . All sides want to extend the lower tax rates for most Americans , leaving the chief dispute over what happens to the tax cuts for couples making $ 250,000 or more a year .\nIn the House , Democrats launched a petition drive to try to circumvent Republicans \u2019 control and force a vote on a bill that would extend tax cuts for most Americans , leaving only the wealthiest without an extension .\n\u201c Everyone here agrees : Taxes should not go up on middle-class families . Democrats and Republicans can come together to make that happen , \u201d said Rep. Timothy J.
