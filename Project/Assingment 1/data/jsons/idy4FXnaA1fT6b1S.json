In an interview with Field & Stream magazine , Biden dropped this little nugget of wisdom on how to deter home invaders . ( Disclaimer : do n't try this at home . )\nF & S : What about the other uses , for self-defense and target practice ? V.P . BIDEN : Well , the way in which we measure it is -- I think most scholars would say==is that as long as you have a weapon sufficient to be able to provide your self-defense . I did one of these town-hall meetings on the Internet and one guy said , `` Well , what happens when the end days come ? What happens when there 's the earthquake ? I live in California , and I have to protect myself . '' I said , `` Well , you know , my shotgun will do better for you than your AR-15 , because you want to keep someone away from your house , just fire the shotgun through the door . '' Most people can handle a shotgun a hell of a lot better than they can a semiautomatic weapon in terms of both their aim and in terms of their ability to deter people coming . We can argue whether that 's true or not , but it is no argument that , for example , a shotgun could do the same job of protecting you . Now , granted , you can come back and say , `` Well , a machine gun could do a better job of protecting me . '' No one 's arguing we should make machine guns legal .\nSounds like a crock , yes ?
