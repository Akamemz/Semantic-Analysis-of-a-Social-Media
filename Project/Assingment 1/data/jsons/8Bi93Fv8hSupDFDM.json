    "content": "Neither of these rules provides any benefit to women \u2019 s health or safety , as doctors and medical associations have said repeatedly and as the trial court judge found . To the contrary , first-trimester abortions , which account for nearly nine in 10 of all abortions , are already among the safest of all medical procedures , with a major-complication rate of less than one-tenth of a percent .\nIn overturning the district court \u2019 s decision , the conservative three-judge panel accepted at face value the law \u2019 s stated purpose , to \u201c provide Texas women choosing abortion the highest standard of health care , \u201d as well as the state \u2019 s claim that there is \u201c medical uncertainty \u201d about the relative risk of abortions performed at clinics , even though there isn \u2019 t any .\nThe Texas law is only one part of the intensifying nationwide effort to make getting an abortion as difficult as possible , a strategy that always hits poor women hardest . In 26 states , women must wait for a period of time , usually 24 to 48 hours , before going through with the procedure . That number will grow when Tennessee \u2019 s new waiting-period law goes into effect in July , and again with the expected signing of a Florida bill . These laws are often paired with a two-visit requirement , making abortions that much more unattainable for women who can not take the time off from work , especially if they must travel long distances multiple times .\nForcing women to travel hundreds of miles for an abortion will also be a central effect of the new Texas law , but this did not move the appeals court judges . That the expected clinic closings are likely to put 900,000 women of childbearing age \u2014 nearly 17 percent of the state \u2019 s total \u2014 150 miles or more from the nearest clinic was not an \u201c undue burden , \u201d they found .\nThat nebulous term \u2014 \u201c undue burden \u201d \u2014 has been the legal test for abortion restrictions since 1992 , when a deal among three Supreme Court justices managed to rescue Roe v. Wade from being completely overturned . But it also made it easier for states to restrict a woman \u2019 s right to choose , and over the past two decades this test has been increasingly exploited by abortion opponents . The justices will have another chance to clarify its meaning in the next year or two , when they will most likely agree to hear a challenge to a restrictive state law , like the one in Texas .",
