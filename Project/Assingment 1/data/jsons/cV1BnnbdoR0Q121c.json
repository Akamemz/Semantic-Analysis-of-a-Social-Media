Flash forward to Tuesday in Las Vegas , and Mrs. Clinton enters as a backer of same-sex couples , a supporter of tighter federal gun control measures , has admitted her vote for the Iraq War was a \u201c mistake \u201d and is an advocate for illegal immigrations .\nAnd on free trade she \u2019 s been around the block a couple of times , having entered the 2008 race a supporter , turned opponent during the campaign , then became a supporter again as secretary of state , and now \u2014 thanks to a flip late last week \u2014 opposes the very Pacific trade deal she championed as the country \u2019 s top diplomat .\n\u201c This is a classic political decision that you can flip-flop if you flop over to the popular side of an issue , \u201d said David Alexrod , a Democratic strategist who advised President Obama \u2019 s bids for the White House , on CNN . \u201c The great risk , though \u2014 her great liability in this race so far \u2014 has been this sense that she \u2019 s been inauthentic . This lurch on this issue opens her up for another charge of inauthenticity . \u201d\nSen. Bernard Sanders , the Vermont independent challenging Mrs. Clinton for Democrats \u2019 presidential nomination , said he \u2019 ll make that very case to voters , and trade will be a chief example . He opposed trade deals with Mexico and Canada , Central America and China .\n\u201c I think that they have been a disaster for the American worker , allowed corporations to shut down here and move abroad , \u201d he said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d Sunday . \u201c So people will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations , big corporations , with the secretary . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Book : Obama , Clinton left Libya a terrorist training site\nWhile she \u2019 s tried to calibrate her stance on trade depending on the politics , she \u2019 s been a little more consistent \u2014 though late , compared to other Democrats \u2014 in her shift on same-sex marriage .\nIn the 2008 campaign she openly opposed it , instead offering civil unions as an acceptable compromise of legal protection for same-sex couples denied the ability to marry their partners .\n\u201c Well , I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and the gay-oriented Logo network . \u201c You know , it \u2019 s a personal position .

That \u2019 s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples . \u201d\nIn the 2008 campaign Mrs. Clinton was steadfast in defending her vote to invade Iraq , a vote Mr. Obama hammered her on and contrasted himself to , saying he would never have authorized the now-unpopular invasion .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until her 2014 book \u201c Hard Choices \u201d that Mrs. Clinton says she \u201c got it wrong \u201d on Iraq .
