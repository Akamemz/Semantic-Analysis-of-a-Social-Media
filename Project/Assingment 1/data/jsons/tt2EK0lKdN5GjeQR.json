But it would be a mistake to view these events as the sum total of the world in 2018.\n\nUnder the radar, some aspects of life on Earth are getting dramatically better. Here are just four.\n\n1) Extreme poverty is falling\n\nThis is probably the most important chart on this list. The extraordinary rate of economic growth in India and China \u2014 as well as slower but still significant growth in other developing countries \u2014 has led to a huge decline in the share of the world population living on less than $1.90 a day, from 35.9 percent in 1990 to only 10 percent in 2015.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s poverty statistics depend on household surveys in 164 different countries, that are carried out over different time periods, in different ways, and so forth, so it takes time for the group to produce point estimates for poverty in a given year.

Unless that changes, the rate of poverty reduction could go down.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that poverty is, in fact, declining. It should be declining faster, but we\u2019re making progress.\n\n2) Child mortality is falling\n\nAn overall improvement in global public health has accompanied the decline in extreme poverty. One good example: kids born in 2017 are much less likely to die in their first five years of life than kids born in 1990 (like myself) were.\n\nThe global under-five mortality rate fell from 93 per 1,000 to 39 to 1,000, meaning it fell by over 58 percent.

Even if the pace of progress slows down, the reduction in death rates in 2018 could wind up saving 100,000 kids\u2019 lives, easily.\n\n3) We\u2019re getting better at preventing preventable diseases\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for the decline in preventable deaths among children. Health improves with income, so the decline in extreme poverty helps, and richer countries can afford more extensive and more universal health care programs. One specific reason worth highlighting is more expenditure on preventative measures: programs that prevent disease and can save lives at quite low cost.\n\nA great example are insecticidal bednets for malaria, a highly effective intervention that can meaningfully prevent infections and save lives.

Target Malaria, the main group working on that solution, could start testing it in the field within the coming decade.\n\n4) Clean energy is getting cheaper\n\nThe big exception to any story of the world getting better is, obviously, climate change. It\u2019s real, the trajectory is bad (we\u2019re on track for 3.1 to 3.7\u00baC of warming by 2100 unless current government policies change), and we\u2019re all going to suffer for it in the coming decades.\n\nBut avoiding total hopelessness on the issue requires paying attention to those areas where things are getting better.
