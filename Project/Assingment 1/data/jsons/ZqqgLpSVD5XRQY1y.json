    "content": "As America continues to fight the COVID-19 virus it seems increasingly likely that when we look back , the pandemic of 2020 \u2013 like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash \u2013 will be a time when the world around us changed in sudden and profound ways . It will affect everything from where we live and work to how we communicate with and relate to others , and even what counts as patriotic service , worthy of the nation \u2019 s salute .\nThat does not mean the post-coronavirus world will be different beyond recognition . The pandemic will not change the basic direction of history so much as accelerate it , according to Richard Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations . The importance of the United States to other nations may decline , while that of China increases ; but that is happening in some form already . Our screen time may skyrocket along with reliance on Zoom , FaceTime , and other video connectors ; but that basic trend preexists . Manufacturers may diversify suppliers to create redundant globalized production chains ; but far-sighted managers have pushed this for some time .\nNor are coming changes completely predictable . The influenza epidemic of 1918 turned the world upside down and ravaged the U.S. population . What followed was not a new seriousness of national purpose , but the Roaring \u2019 20s , a free-spending decade remembered today as one of the shallowest eras of American life .\nBut crises can shake up the status quo . They override tendencies toward inertia , open room for the consideration of new ideas , and push aside past impediments . The ideas for the big government programs that became the New Deal had been bouncing around U.S. politics for years before Franklin Roosevelt became president , says Margaret O \u2019 Mara , a professor of history at the University of Washington in Seattle . It took the shock of the 1929 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression to make them law .\n\u201c Great crises can change the rules of the game and people \u2019 s attitudes about political possibility really fast , \u201d Dr. O \u2019 Mara says .\nMark J. Terrill/AP A cyclist rides with an American flag as the USNS Mercy docks at the Port of Los Angeles . The 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship was brought in to help take the load off Los Angeles area hospitals as they treat coronavirus patients .\nIf there \u2019 s one thing the COVID-19 pandemic is almost certain to shift into hyperdrive , it \u2019 s the movement of more and more of our activities online .\nThe most obvious of these changes are occurring in the midst of the outbreak as tens of millions of people struggle to keep up some semblance of their old routines . Virtual schooling is now part of the curriculum for many of the 124,000-plus U.S. schools affected by a coronavirus shutdown , for instance . In the past , many school systems have resisted widespread online learning or found it difficult to integrate into existing lesson plans . Now they have little choice .\nBut today \u2019 s basic diet of Zoom lectures and student show-and-tells don \u2019 t fully reflect what online education can do , say its advocates . For instance , a more sophisticated integration of virtual and live instruction could help high schools match the achievement gains primary education has made in recent years .\nMeanwhile , telemedicine is exploding . Right now , doctors are still struggling with such basic questions as how online health care fits into existing billing practices , but in the future it could allow much greater collaboration among diverse team members and health organizations . And of course , online ordering of everything from soup to bolts is for many people the new normal .\nRelated to this acceleration of the digital is the increasing importance of big tech to the national welfare . If this moment in history is the moral equivalent of war , are Microsoft , Amazon , Google , Facebook , and Twitter emerging as the new arsenals of democracy , as GM , Ford , and Chrysler did during World War II ?\nAfter all Bill Gates , shed of his corporate responsibilities at Microsoft , is increasingly outspoken about fighting all manner of health crises . Amazon is America \u2019 s delivery backbone . Facebook is the new radio , the way an isolated society communicates and receives news . President Donald Trump turned to a Google division to construct a website for locating COVID-19 test sites \u2013 though that hasn \u2019 t progressed much so far .\n\u201c The tech companies are really part of this now , \u201d says Dr. O \u2019 Mara , author of the recent book \u201c The Code : Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America . \u201d\nThis could mean a significant shift in big tech \u2019 s image , Dr. O \u2019 Mara notes . Until recent years Silicon Valley has largely ignored politics as well as any concerns about the more unsavory aspects of its impact on society . Then tech itself became a political headline , with Mark Zuckerberg hauled before Congress to defend Facebook policies on issues such as data sharing and election security .\n\u201c It became very clear that tech was not only not adequate to address some of our most complicated social problems ... but that it was not changing the world in the right way , \u201d says Dr. O \u2019 Mara .\nThen America was struck by a grave public health threat whose effect on society is unmatched by any crisis since World War II , and perhaps could surpass even that for its sheer breadth . Leadership at the top of government , with some exceptions , has struggled to meet the challenge . The economic fallout will ripple through every sector of the economy , devastating some , such as airlines , hotels , and restaurants .\n\u201c The only sector that may come out of this with more money in the bank is tech , \u201d says Dr. O \u2019 Mara .\nWith their global workforces and global reach , tech firms are uniquely situated to provide moral leadership and a global perspective , she says . Yet their preexisting problems remain : worries about the privacy of personal data and the little-checked spread of false information .\nIt \u2019 s also important to remember that a continuing digital revolution will leave many people behind . Laptops and Wi-Fi connections are expensive ; many low-income families can \u2019 t reliably connect for telework or virtual education . Some 42 million Americans , and a quarter of all rural residents , don \u2019 t have access to broadband internet , according to a recent report from BroadbandNow Research .\nJL/SIPA/AP Jayen , a 13-year-old student in Miramar , Florida , participates in a virtual class from her bedroom . Schools in Florida \u2019 s Broward County , like elsewhere across the country , are shut down .\nLife in American cities may not be the same after the coronavirus recedes . At the least , things probably won \u2019 t return to anything resembling the old normal for a long time .\nMany urban areas have been shrinking for decades as their populations migrate to inner-ring suburbs and more distant areas . It \u2019 s possible the pandemic will accelerate this movement as people flee to the perceived safety of larger open spaces .\nSome wealthy Americans packed up and left New York and other central cities for second homes or hotels in the Hamptons , or the Catskills , or on Cape Cod . A percentage of these may not return if their work and family situations allow . Similar dispersions may happen elsewhere around the globe , say some experts .\n\u201c We may now be witnessing the outlines of a new , and necessary , dispersion of population , not only in the wide open spaces of North America and Australia , but even in the megacities of the developing world , \u201d wrote Joel Kotkin , executive director of the Urban Reform Institute , in an article in the publication Quillette in late March .\nBut this may not mean cities per se are set to wither , or that their attributes will become less attractive to people drawn to the pulse of urban life . The terrible flu pandemic of 1918 did not destroy hard-hit cities , after all . Pittsburgh was ravaged , as was Detroit . Both thrived afterward .\n\u201c The point is that no pandemic in history \u2013 and many have been worse [ than COVID-19 ] \u2013 has been enough to derail the force of urbanization , \u201d says Richard Florida , an urbanist and professor at the University of Toronto \u2019 s Rotman School of Management and School of Cities . \u201c The clustering of people , clustering of ideas , and trading with one another have made the world a more productive and innovative place . \u201d\nWhat the coronavirus will do is reshape the way people work and interact in cities at a micro level for a midrange period of time , until a vaccine is able to bring it under control , says Dr. Florida . It \u2019 s hard to anticipate exactly what these changes will be , he says . People may be worried about returning to city offices and taking mass transit , so it \u2019 s possible they will opt to live in center cities and walk , or resume driving to work , creating more traffic congestion . Small businesses will look different , with restaurant tables placed farther apart , hair salon chairs dispersed or divided from one another , and so forth .\nChildren will return to very different schools , Dr. Florida predicts , with temperature checks at the door and social distancing in the lunch room . Other changes that he believes will need to take place before cities reopen for business include retrofitting airports , convention centers , and other infrastructure for screenings and personal separation , and financial support for arts and cultural institutions that help provide urban areas with vitality .\n\u201c We have to prepare our communities , our playgrounds , our arenas to get up and running safely , \u201d Dr. Florida says .\nIn the post-pandemic world some types of urban areas might do better than others . Los Angeles , a big world-class city built around the concept of sprawling neighborhoods of single-family homes , could benefit from people \u2019 s desire to insulate themselves in a bit of space . So could smallish cities that offer some cultural amenities but are close enough to bigger places to serve as a type of satellite .\nOne example of this might be Hudson , New York , up the river from New York City . People can experience different degrees of density , despite living in the same city , based on their relative wealth and class , Dr. Florida says .\nAbout a third of the workforce nationwide is wealthy enough to afford extensive deliveries of food and other staples , and to carry out much of their jobs through telework . Another third is composed of blue-collar workers who stock the produce aisles , drive delivery trucks , and otherwise are at risk on the pandemic front lines . The last third are poor people , who have little choice but to hunker down .\nYes , the richest of the rich can jet to their second or third homes , moving to physically distance themselves from any health threat . But could they actually root themselves in their chalets ? If they have school-age children , they might not find local educational options attractive . In any case , the isolation they see as a buffer might be illusory . Rural health care options are often limited \u2013 and rural counties with attractive recreational amenities , such as the ski slopes of Colorado , have had a high per capita incidence of COVID-19 , Dr. Florida points out .\nCoronavirus refugees have also sparked fear and resentment among those who live in rural areas full time . In one infamous incident on the Maine island of Vinalhaven , a group of locals cut down a tree on March 27 in an attempt to forcibly barricade several New Jersey residents inside the home they were renting . Dr. Florida says such conflicts could become bitter if they pit states against states . \u201c One of the things that worries me is these border battles in general , \u201d he says .\nJohn Locher/AP Medical student Claire Chen ( right ) tests for virus cases at a makeshift camp for the homeless in Las Vegas . Officials opened part of a city parking lot as a temporary homeless shelter .\nThe nation \u2019 s sense of what constitutes patriotic service may enlarge and change after COVID-19 . For years many of America \u2019 s red-white-and-blue rituals have centered on celebrating the military . There \u2019 s the honor guard for the national anthem , the F-22 flyovers for home openers , the line of greeters saying \u201c thank you for your service \u201d to the troops disembarking at airports for leave .\nIt \u2019 s meant to honor people who have agreed to risk their lives to protect the larger community . Some of it derives from the memory of the Vietnam years , when protesters in a bitterly divided U.S. turned their backs on veterans , and worse .\nBut not all heroes wear camo . In the coronavirus pandemic it is everyday Americans , from doctors and nurses and EMTs to grocery workers and delivery drivers , who are putting their health and lives at risk to protect and provide for everyone else .\n\u201c Hopefully we \u2019 ll have maybe a more inclusive sense of patriotism \u201d after the pandemic , says Mark Lawrence Schrad , an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University and author of \u201c Vodka Politics : Alcohol , Autocracy , and the Secret History of the Russian State . \u201d\nDr. Schrad says he \u2019 s come to this conclusion a roundabout way . One of the things he teaches his students about is nationalism . And a part of nationalism , he says , is constructing the \u201c we \u201d that defines the nation , against the \u201c them \u201d that stand outside it .\nPatriotism is one aspect used in building that \u201c we. \u201d But in the current situation , the \u201c them \u201d isn \u2019 t the Soviet Union , or Al Qaeda , or humans at all . It \u2019 s amorphous and as dangerous to our geopolitical adversaries as it is to us .\nDr. Schrad believes that , if the nation is in such a new place , maybe it needs a new kind of patriotism . Election monitors serve the country \u2013 and in Wisconsin recently , working amid the pandemic , bravely so . Teachers serve the community . And now , so do UPS drivers , and postal workers , and agricultural field hands , and hospital orderlies , and a whole range of people whose jobs require them to continue to work with others despite the dangers and lockdowns .\nMaybe grocery workers will be honored at halftime during NFL games when the league restarts . Maybe the nurses of community hospitals will march at the front of small town July Fourth parades .\nBut even before then we can all start thanking them for their service . \u201c They didn \u2019 t sign on for this , \u201d Dr. Schrad says .\nAlex Gallardo/Reuters Joseph Alvarado makes deliveries for Amazon in Costa Mesa , California . Shopping online for everything is becoming part of the new normal as much of the world remains on lockdown .\nThe coronavirus crisis is certainly bringing us closer together , in some ways , but also pushing us apart .\nTechnology has ensured that everybody remains booked \u2013 at least , everybody who has high-speed internet and wants to remain connected to friends and relatives .

That doesn \u2019 t even include all the work-related videoconferencing .

It \u2019 s hard to say no \u2013 excuses to avoid online chats are more limited than for getting together in real life . And there \u2019 s something about them that is just more restrictive .

Dr. Turkle calls these communication extras \u201cfriction.\u201d In this sense, friction refers to the \u201cmessiness of politics, of the dinner table, the intimate conversation, the playground, the public square.\u201d\n\nWhen the pandemic is over, we may come out of it, not hooked on the ease of transferring all our conversations to the infosphere, but missing and honoring the small glitches and unspoken connections that real life entails.\n\n\u201cEmpathy requires conversations with friction,\u201d says Dr. Turkle.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: As a public service, all our coronavirus coverage is free.
