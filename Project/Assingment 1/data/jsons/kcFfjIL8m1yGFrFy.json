In 2014 , the top 20 percent of households took home a majority of U.S. income , 51.2 percent . And a large share of that income was concentrated among the richest 5 percent of households , which received 21.9 percent of the nation \u2019 s income in 2014 . That means that the middle class and those living in poverty took home less than half of the economic pie , despite constituting the vast majority of the population .

Our 2013 income measure is from the Census Bureau subsample that received redesigned income questions. In 2013, the subsample who received the redesigned questions were shown to have a higher median household income than those who received the traditional questions. While this methodology is consistent with the 2014 data, this change could affect long-term data comparisons. See Appendix D of the Census Bureau\u2019s \u201cIncome and Poverty in the United States: 2014\u201d for more information.",
