In August , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , ruling in a case from Michigan , declared that if a public university adjudicates what is essentially a \u201c he said , she said \u201d case , \u201c the university must give the accused student or his agent an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. \u201d This year , two California appellate courts have overturned university decisions to suspend students for committing sexual assault because their procedures were so lacking in basic due process .\nMeanwhile , my client has been barred from campus for mor e than nine months . ( His suspension was based on this allegation and a second allegation by another accuser , which was found to be unsubstantiated by the evidence ; that accuser is appealing . ) The DeVos regulations and the two California appellate rulings are most likely his only hope of avoiding an expulsion that would tar him as a campus sex offender and most likely prevent him from getting into another school .\nThe current system of adjudicating sexual assault complaints is broken . Under the rules set up by the Obama administration , hundreds of colleges , including many in California , were placed under federal investigation and threatened with the loss of funding for failing to adequately investigate sexual assault complaints . The definition of what constituted an assault was vastly expanded . Nonpunitive resolutions such as mediation were forbidden , even if that is what both sides wanted .\nThe Obama rules were written to address a real problem : a tendency by colleges to sweep sexual assault allegations under the rug . But it also gave risk-averse schools incentives to expel the accused without any reliable fact-finding process .\nThe Office of Civil Rights does not collect data on race in Title IX cases , but the little we know is disturbing : An analysis of assault accusations at Colgate , for example , found that w hile only 4.2 percent of the college \u2019 s students were black in the 2012-13 school year , 50 percent of the sexual-violation accusations reported to the school were against black students , and blacks made up 40 percent of the students who went through the formal disciplinary process .\nWe have long over-sexualized , over-criminalized and disproportionately punished black men .
