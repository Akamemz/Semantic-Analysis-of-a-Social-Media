    "content": "In recent years economic studies have illuminated the extent to which global trade agreements , while benefitting many consumers , have also led to significant job losses in the U.S. \u2014 particularly due to jobs moving to China after 2001 . Now a new study co-authored by MIT economist David Autor ( along with non-MIT colleagues David Dorn , Gordon Hanson , and Kaveh Majlesi ) identifies a political effect from this economic process . From 2002 through 2010 , in U.S. congressional districts particularly affected by job losses due to trade , elected members of the House of Representatives becamemore ideologically extreme , with moderates consistently losing out in both parties . Autor spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 this week about the headline-grabbing results .\nQ . Your new working paper establishes a strong relationship between job losses in the U.S. due to global trade , and political changes in the U.S. Congress \u2014 but the phenomenon at work is not what many people might guess . What did you find ?\nA. There \u2019 s been a 30-year trend of rising polarization in the U.S. Congress . A lot of areas economically affected by rising trade exposure , especially in the South , have also been moving politically to the right . We wondered if these economic shocks might be contributing to the political factionalization . There are multiple ways this could work . One would be an anti-incumbent effect : It \u2019 s well established that politicians are punished for bad economic outcomes . But we don \u2019 t find that . Another possibility might be that the effects of trade shocks would just strongly favor one party over another . But the answer there is also no , not really .\nHowever , if you look at ideology rather than party , you do see very sharp movements . But they \u2019 re movements across ideological space . So moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans are being voted out of office in trade-exposed areas and being replaced with much more ideologically ardent substitutes . A lot of these gains are on the right . But that \u2019 s not entirely the case . If you look at initially Democratic voting districts , you see a very sharp movement to the left \u2014 as well as , to some degree , gains for Republicans in some of those districts . So you see this polarization occurring where moderates of both parties are being removed in trade-affected areas , and are being replaced by candidates who win by smaller margins and have more ideological views .\nQ . Is it fair to say this also corresponds to the ethnic composition of the voters in these congressional districts ? And what accounts for this subtle wrinkle in the findings , in which a few of these districts do flip from the Democrats to the Republicans ?\nA . We haven \u2019 t done an overwhelming number of ethnic breakdowns , but the one we did that we thought was useful , was that we broke districts into those where the majority of the population was non-Hispanic white , and those where less than half of the population was non-Hispanic white . There are only 66 districts in the study [ out of 435 in Congress ] which are majority-minority . But in those cases you see very sharp movements to the left . By contrast , in the areas that are majority non-Hispanic white , all the movement is to the right : Moderate Democrats are removed from office , moderate Republicans are removed from office to a lesser extent , and conservative Republicans make enormous gains . And there are no gains for Democrats .\nQ . In terms of voter beliefs , what is the mechanism here ? What explains how such similar types of job losses due to trade lead to such divergent political outcomes ?\nA . Imagine you have two groups of people , liberals and conservatives , and they share the same objective : They want workers to be employed and protected from the shocks of globalization . And then you have a big [ trade ] shock , and a lot of people lose employment . You might think everyone should converge on what we should do about that . But you can have a setting where beliefs are sufficiently disjointed , such that the same information is interpreted in completely different ways by people observing it . Say I \u2019 m a liberal Democrat and I want workers to be protected . A trade shock might lead me to say , \u201c This confirms what I suspected .
