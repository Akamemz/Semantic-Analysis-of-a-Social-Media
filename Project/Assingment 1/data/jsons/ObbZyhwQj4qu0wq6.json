Mr. Gingrich said it could take a few weeks for something to jell .\nMr. McLaughlin , in a poll last month , tested whether voters would respond to a Trump-backed plan for term limits on Congress , paid parental leave , making the 2017 tax cuts permanent , and \u201c workfare , \u201d or requiring able-bodied people receiving government benefits to prove they are attempting to find jobs rather than staying on the public dole for prolonged periods .\nThe platform tested surprisingly well , with 50 percent saying they would be more likely to back Republicans who embraced that plan . That included 45 percent of independents , compared with 31 percent who said they would be less likely to get behind a Republican promoting that agenda .\nMatt Sparks , a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , California Republican , said party leaders have been talking about honing their brand , but that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean agreeing on a specific platform .\nWhat is clear , he said , is that President Trump \u2019 s to-do list has been \u2014 and will be \u2014 Congress \u2019 agenda .\n\u201c We have started to fund the [ border ] wall , but we need to finish it .
