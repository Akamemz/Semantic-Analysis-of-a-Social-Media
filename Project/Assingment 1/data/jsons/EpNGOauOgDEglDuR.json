    "content": "Paul Ryan showed up to Senate Republicans \u2019 weekly lunch on Tuesday hoping to salvage a controversial pillar of his tax reform plan that would change how imports and exports are taxed . \u201c Keep your powder dry , \u201d the House speaker pleaded .\nThe next day , Sen. Tom Cotton took to the Senate floor to slam Ryan \u2019 s so-called border adjustment tax , saying \u201c some ideas are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them . \u201d\n\u201c Many other senators share these concerns and we most certainly will not \u2018 keep our powder dry , \u2019 \u201d Cotton went on , without naming the speaker in his speech .\nThe sequence was an ominous sign for a linchpin of Ryan \u2019 s tax plan \u2014 and perhaps for the prospects of tax reform happening at all . The border adjustment tax would generate more than a trillion dollars over a decade ; there \u2019 s no obvious way to replace that money , which is needed to help pay for a steep cut in corporate and income taxes .\nIn meetings with administration officials and Senate leaders , Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff , which the president wants , and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes . He has suggested it 's in keeping with President Donald Trump \u2019 s \u201c America first \u201d mantra , since it would reward American manufacturers that make products here and sell it abroad .\nBut the idea is sharply dividing Republicans \u2014 even within the White House .\nTrump 's chief strategist Steve Bannon likes it , but the president \u2019 s chief economic adviser , Gary Cohn , is opposed , according to people who have talked with them . Trump himself has acknowledged he doesn \u2019 t think much of the proposal , though he has said he will keep an open mind .\nMany Republican senators say privately they detest the concept , fretting that it will hurt their in-state retailers like Walmart , which is headquartered in Cotton 's state of Arkansas . Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) , sources said , has warned Trump and Ryan that border adjustment wo n't likely have the support needed to clear the Senate .\nHatch , in an interview after Ryan 's presentation , said the speaker \u201c didn \u2019 t cover [ the border adjustment proposal ] as specifically as I would have liked. \u201d And Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri , the fifth-ranking GOP senator , said the Finance Committee will likely go a \u201c different way . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s beyond a complication . It \u2019 s a bad economic proposition , \u201d said Sen. David Perdue ( R-Ga. ) .\nThat \u2019 s not to mention Ryan \u2019 s issue in his own chamber .

Supporters of Ryan \u2019 s proposal are crossing their fingers that Trump doesn \u2019 t introduce a detailed tax plan at all , worried it could complicate their work .\nA source familiar with the White House \u2019 s thinking said it \u2019 s unlikely Trump would try to push through the border-adjustment tax if key administration officials and senators are still divided over it .\n\u201c It \u2019 s fair to say there \u2019 s a lot of questions about how it would work and the assumptions on which it \u2019 s based , \u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) .\nDuring a news conference Thursday , Ryan downplayed questions about opposition to the border adjustment tax and argued some people simply don \u2019 t understand how it works .

His idea , he added , would make American businesses more competitive worldwide .\nSenior House Republican sources who back him say the House has been working on tax reform for years and has already considered numerous financing mechanisms .
