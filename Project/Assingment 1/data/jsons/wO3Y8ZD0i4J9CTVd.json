    "content": "Last month , Sophia Gabrielle Stanford was at the center of a fundraising campaign . The GoFundMe page described the trans activist as a victim of a \u201c brutal and aggressively blatant hate crime \u201d in which assailants had beaten her unconscious with a bat in southeast Portland .\nThe campaign and shocking story went viral . However , the police reports raise questions about what happened that night .\nIn the early hours of Sunday , Feb. 10 , emergency services received a call about a woman , identified as Stanford , found on a sidewalk with scrapes on her face and knuckles , claiming that she may have been assaulted . The responding officer , Edgar Mitchell , noted that Stanford smelled of alcohol .\n\u201c I asked [ Officer Zachary Roe ] what happened , \u201d the report states . \u201c Roe said the individual admitted to being intoxicated , and Roe believed the person fell and hit her head . \u201d\nStanford either could not or would not state her name to the police . The responding officer was unable to discover Stanford \u2019 s name and claims that she made a threat : \u201c If you don \u2019 t treat me right , my people will get you , \u201d she said , according to the report .\nThe report also states that Stanford lost a pistol and bag she was carrying at the time of the alleged attack . A local resident found both items and flagged down another officer , Cuong Nguyen . When Nguyen attempted to return the gun to Stanford at nearby Emanuel Hospital , where she had been transported , she was already discharged .\nThe GoFundMe page stated that Stanford had suffered a \u201c serious concussion \u201d and would need intensive physical therapy , CT scans and counseling .\nThe case was investigated by the bias-crimes unit but was suspended due to the lack of tangible leads . Although it is impossible to know what exactly happened , nothing in the police reports indicate that Stanford told police she was attacked with a bat by multiple assailants in a hate crime .\nThe next day , however , the sensational and detailed story emerged in the fundraising appeal . Over $ 10,000 was raised .\nSophia Stanford blocked me across several social media accounts after I sent a request for comment .\nIn progressive Portland where the \u201c # Resistance \u201d is mainstream , stories like Stanford \u2019 s feed into a whisper campaign of violent homophobes , transphobes and racists lurking on every corner . A moral panic had now been ignited .\nWithin days , the number of alleged hate attacks ballooned through uncorroborated and vague online rumors . These stories were then amplified by progressive media , nonprofit groups , businesses and politicians . Activists , driven by their own personal grievances , then launched a crusade to find the phantom suspects , doxing and targeting innocent people in the process .\nOn Feb. 17 , Jenny Bruso , a self-described fat-queer activist , posted a claim on Facebook and Twitter that echoed Stanford \u2019 s harrowing story . She said that her partner , Brie Jones , was attacked by \u201c two young white men \u201d in a maroon SUV who pulled up beside her at a busy intersection , called her a homophobic slur and threw a full can of beer at her face . She was allegedly knocked to the ground from the impact . Bruso posted a photo of Jones with an abrasion on her cheek .\nI spoke with staff at businesses along that intersection , but nobody I talked to had witnessed an attack . When Bruso \u2019 s post went viral on Facebook and commenters raised questions about the incident , she deleted the post .\n\u201c I , WE , owe you NOTHING , \u201d Bruso wrote on Facebook . \u201c The intention was to warn our communities and that \u2019 s precisely what I did . \u201d\nBruso originally said the attack was \u201c reported , \u201d but Portland police stated in a report that there was no case number associated with the incident as of Feb. 27 , 2019 . I contacted Bruso several times by email asking where she reported the incident . She didn \u2019 t respond .\nWhen I sent her a text seeking comment , she responded : \u201c Don \u2019 t contact me . Don \u2019 t text me . \u201d\nEven with Bruso \u2019 s story deleted from Facebook , screenshots and copy-and-pasted posts went viral , stoking a tense atmosphere already generated from Stanford \u2019 s earlier allegation . The larger narrative of bigoted white men patrolling Portland to attack LGBT people then began to take on a life of its own . Activists sent out \u201c attack alerts \u201d warning the queer public to carry Mace and to travel in groups . Other activists circulated photos and addresses of the alleged attackers in flyers around town and on social media posts .\nThe city was in a panic , and it focused its energy on one main antagonist : the Proud Boys , a right-wing , pro-Trump fraternity and drinking club . They were blamed for the indiscriminate violence .\nThe group has infamously been involved in bloody street brawls against Antifa . Members of the group are currently facing charges for a 2018 fight in the Portland area .\n\u201c These are the faces of the attackers that have been terrorizing the queer/trans community lately . If you see any of these faces in public , hit them with a brick , because the police don \u2019 t do anything to stop it , \u201d read one widely shared post on Instagram . It included a group photo of the men and names .\nAs the number of shares and retweets increased on this post and similar posts , so too did the number of alleged attacks . What started off as two stories of hate crimes grew to 15 . The claims grew wilder . The Proud Boys were accused of now using hammers and wooden planks as weapons . Also alleged : an attempted kidnapping .\n\u201c Red pickup with a black cover and 3 white guys hollering at a woman I know outside a gay bar and while she walked home one got out and pulled her in by her collar , \u201d wrote user \u201c Siggitrue \u201d on the Portland subreddit .\nThe user told me the alleged robbery and kidnapping was reported to cops , but Portland police said it did not receive any report matching this description . When I followed up with \u201c Siggitrue , \u201d the user said that they were unwilling to reveal the woman \u2019 s identity out of fear for her safety and wrote : \u201c I \u2019 m also not obligated to provide you with any information , so the trail ends here . \u201d\nMost social media users who shared stories refused to comment . Others admitted to repeating uncorroborated rumors . Andrew Lucht , a Portland resident who wrote a viral Facebook post releasing names and photos of accused attackers , told me he was not a witness to any attacks and did not know any of the victims . His post had accused the Proud Boys of being involved in murders .\n\u201c I \u2019 m surprised the post took off the way it did , \u201d Lucht told me . \u201c I heard all of this initially from a friend who was very upset. \u201d That friend is neither a witness or victim , he said . \u201c I believe I heard [ about a ] murder in one of their messages , but in hindsight , I could be wrong. \u201d Lucht took down his viral post after one of the accused men threatened legal action for libel .\nRumors of attacks did not circulate only among radical-activist networks . Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler amplified the rumors on Twitter . So too did the Portland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America , which blamed \u201c right-wing agitators \u201d for the attacks . Car-ride company Lyft shared an advertisement aimed at Portland \u2019 s LGBT community . It repeated the rumors and offered a ride credit to encourage business . Activists organized a \u201c safety day \u201d training event featuring a workshop called \u201c Local Fash 101 \u201d where attendees were taught how to spot fascists .\nThe Portland Mercury published multiple stories and printed a claim from a woman who alleged via email that she was the victim of a brutal gay bashing in downtown Portland . ( The article does not cite any records and I could find no corroborating evidence that this happened as described . )\nWhen I asked reporter Blair Stenvick what steps she took to independently verify that allegation , she said : \u201c I \u2019 m not interested in discussing this with you. \u201d Portland Mercury \u2019 s news editor , Alex Zielinski , also declined to comment on my inquiry . The paper \u2019 s reports were widely shared and used to legitimize the panic .\nThose who spread the rumors were cheered for bringing \u201c awareness \u201d to LGBT issues . Lost in all this was any concern for the people victimized in the process .\nOne of the men who says he was falsely accused in the panic is Robert Zerfing , a 35-year-old Battle Ground , Wash. , resident . He used to attend conservative rallies in the Portland area but has since renounced the Proud Boys for their involvement in brawls .\nJenny Bruso claimed that her partner \u2019 s attackers drove a maroon Bronco or Suburban . Doxers identified that Zerfing owned a maroon SUV and used that as evidence he was involved in the attack even though that car was repossessed three months ago . He showed me one of the many death threats he now receives .\n\u201c I guess we will find out when we pay that address a visit , \u201d the text reads . \u201c 4 hate crimes in the last week you were involved in . Paybacks a bitch mother f\u2013ker . \u201d\nAll the men I contacted who were blamed for the attacks categorically deny having any involvement . Some are current Proud Boys members in various chapters across the West Coast , some are ex-members and others were random rally attendees who were photographed at events between 2017 and 2018 .\n\u201c The Proud Boys is the most welcoming organization that I have ever been a part of , \u201d Fred Swink , an openly gay Proud Boys member in Vancouver , Wash. , told me . Swink has spent years being involved in the queer scene , where he was once the publisher of Stonewall News , an LGBT newspaper in Spokane . Swink is also familiar with gay bashing . In 2008 , there was a series of alleged assaults on gay men in Spokane who were lured and mugged through hookup sites . Some of them were closeted or married to women and did not go to the police .\n\u201c Many victims never report for a variety of reasons , \u201d Swink says . \u201c But if they start making allegations that provide no details , that just creates hysteria . The men I knew who didn \u2019 t report their attacks to police also didn \u2019 t bring attention to themselves through viral social media posts on Twitter or Facebook . \u201d\nIndeed it is known that some victims don \u2019 t report crimes against their perpetrator . Many fear that they will not be believed . What is less understood is why anyone might expect people to believe they \u2019 re the victim of a crime in the absence of evidence .\nAs in the case of Jussie Smollett , who is suspected of orchestrating a racist homophobic attack on himself , making wild allegations of bias-motivated assault creates hysteria , mistrust and a breakdown of law and order .\nWhich is a fair description of what happened on Feb. 24 at an emergency \u201c town hall \u201d organized by the Q Center , an LGBT organization in Portland . Executive director Cameron Whitten explained that the severity of what the community was experiencing called for extrajudicial measures .\n\u201c We have not reached out to the Portland Police Bureau , \u201d he told the crowd of 500 people who whooped and clapped . Alleged victims were encouraged to report anonymously online to activist organizations , according to fliers handed out at the door . Portland United Against Hate is one such organization . The group did not respond when I asked what mechanisms it has in place to vet and verify anonymous online reports .\nWhitten said at the town hall that there had been 10 attacks but in an interview with me admitted that he had only spoken directly with one alleged victim . That individual told him of a negative experience with police rather than experiencing a hate crime . The other person he spoke to was an \u201c advocate \u201d of Sophia Stanford whom he declined to name .\nOutside of the initial allegation by Stanford , none of the purported incidents of beatings , killings or kidnapping were \u2014 I confirmed with Portland police \u2014 reported to authorities .\nDid these crimes really happen ? Wilfred Reilly , a political scientist at Kentucky State and author of the book \u201c Hate Crime Hoax , \u201d says the nonreporting and cinematic narrative are indications they might not have .\n\u201c If you were actually beaten by a group of homophobes , you \u2019 d go down to the precinct house before you \u2019 d go on Twitter and Facebook , \u201d he says . Through his research , Reilly has collected more than 500 cases of American hate hoaxes concentrated mostly between 2013 and 2018 .\nPatterns he identifies among them are the lack of evidence , reluctance to cooperate with police , sensational claims , the presence of fundraising and the involvement of radical activists \u2014 all of which appear to be happening in Portland .\nFear and hatred of police may sound irrational in progressive Portland , where the sympathetic mayor doubles as the police commissioner , but it \u2019 s also convenient \u2014 until it \u2019 s not . Filing a false police report , as Smollett was suspected of doing , is a crime . And while Chicago prosecutors last week dropped their charges against Smollett in a strange twist that \u2019 s now being probed by the FBI , most people who waste police time don \u2019 t get off lightly .\nIt \u2019 s clear that Sophia Stanford and Brie Jones were injured . What \u2019 s less clear is how those injuries actually occurred . Only the people actually involved know , and nobody is apparently willing to speak .\nAndy Ngo is an editor at Quillette .
