    "content": "American and Israeli flags outside the U.S Embassy in Tel Aviv , Israel . ( Amir Cohen/Reuters )\nThere is no convincing argument that the destabilized Israel sought by the Ilhan Omars and Rashida Tlaibs of the world would serve U.S. interests .\nClifford May tells this story about George Schultz sending off newly confirmed ambassadors as secretary of state : \u201c He would show them a very large globe . And he would spin the globe , and he would say , \u2018 Show me your country. \u2019 And with great pride , they \u2019 d point out Brunei or Equatorial Guinea or some place in Latin America . And he would invariably shake his head and say , \u2018 No , that \u2019 s not your country . Your country is the United States of America . You should never , ever forget that . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c America First ! \u201d is the slogan of the day , and not only on the right , though populist Democrats generally prefer a slightly different rhetorical formulation . ( Barack Obama called for \u201c nation-building here at home \u201d and complained about \u201c free riders \u201d abroad , and even tried to rehabilitate Theodore Roosevelt \u2019 s \u201c New Nationalism. \u201d To-MAY-to , to-MAH-to . ) One might be forgiven for wondering how seriously people take that slogan : Democrats do not act as though , e.g. , our immigration policies should be shaped according to the interests of the American people ; Republicans \u2019 \u201c America First ! \u201d proclamations often end up meaning \u201c Boeing First ! \u201d or \u201c Nucor First ! \u201d But we all , it is supposed , know which one is our country .\nOf course , Representative Ilhan Omar ( D. , Minn. ) doesn \u2019 t believe that . She has argued in the past that American Jews suffer from divided loyalties vis-\u00e0-vis Israel , an ancient anti-Semitic libel that should be obvious enough to Representative Omar , who no doubt is aware that certain knuckle-dragging elements in our national life believe roughly the same thing about Muslims , that they can never really be good citizens and good Muslims both .\nIsrael is the other special relationship . The original \u201c special relationship , \u201d the one we have with the United Kingdom , has received some attention from President Donald Trump and his administration , partly because Trump believes he sees his watery reflection in the Brexit movement , which is at least a little bit true . ( Who , then , is the Nigel Farage of U.S. politics ? Steve King , maybe ? ) But Israel is much more on the political map .\nU.S. interest in the Middle East was rekindled after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . Israel \u2019 s liberalism and democracy were shown in starkest contrast to the savagery of those attacks and the savagery of those around the Muslim world who endorsed and celebrated them . Israel \u2019 s social and economic success story is , cynically seen , a great big raised middle finger to the backward and stagnant quarters that incubated and harbored the likes of Osama bin Laden .\nAnd much has been made of the American Right \u2019 s religious interest in Israel \u2014 perhaps too much . There are American Christians who take a proprietary interest in the Jewish state for religious reasons , including apocalyptic ones . But that tendency is overstated in the public mind . And the old Moral Majority \u2019 s style of Evangelical assertiveness is at a low ebb , with neither conservative Protestants nor Reaganite Catholics looming quite so large in Republican and right-wing politics as they once did . This has to do mainly with conservatives \u2019 winning the Cold War and losing the Sexual Revolution . Win some , lose some . The hot Bible-based politics of the moment is explaining President Trump as an avatar of King Cyrus , the ungodly pagan who was divinely anointed in spite of his infidelity . There \u2019 s at least as much motivated reasoning in theology as in the law .\nBut the American Left takes an intense interest in Israel as well : The Left hates Israel , and many of its leading lights wish to see the Jewish state as such liquidated . Representative Omar is hardly alone in that , nor are anti-Israel invective or outright anti-Semitism ever more than an arm \u2019 s length from the Democratic mainstream . No less a figure than Barack Obama has felt himself obliged to bend the knee just a little to Louis Farrakhan . As my colleague David French notes , the group that had planned to host Representative Omar and Representative Rashida Tlaib on a trip to Israel not only is knee-deep in the boycott-Israel campaign but also has published Jew-hating propaganda written by avowed neo-Nazis .\nWriting in the New York Times , Tom Friedman has , as he often has , a funny way of looking at this . President Trump can not proclaim his love of Israel and the Israeli people often enough or loudly enough . ( His trusted son-in-law and his beloved daughter are , it is worth remembering , Orthodox Jews . ) But Friedman sees only darkness in this : \u201c Trump \u2019 s way of \u2014 and motivation for \u2014 expressing his affection for Israel is guided by his political desire to improve his re-election chances by depicting the entire Republican Party as pro-Israel and the entire Democratic Party as anti-Israel. \u201d Well . Imagine going back in time to the 1930s and explaining to a refugee : \u201c At some point in the future , the American president will kiss up to an independent , self-governing Jewish state , but only because it \u2019 s good politics ! \u201d Glory be .\nFriedman is not 100 percent wrong in his argument here \u2014 and he is about 80 percent wrong , on average . It may not be that the entire Republican party is pro-Israel , but the GOP is overwhelmingly pro-Israel , and has been with and without Benjamin Netanyahu in office . And it is not the case that the entire Democratic party is anti-Israel , though it unquestionably is the case that the ascendant left wing of the Democratic party is anti-Israel . Representative Omar is bitterly anti-Israel , to the point of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes . Representative Tlaib is anti-Israel . A whole lot of Democrats who support the BDS movement are anti-Israel .\nThe Right \u2019 s celebratory interest in Israel is easy to understand , even if you think some of it is a little dopey . But why is the Left so intensely interested in Israel ? Of course , there are things to criticize about Israel and its government . But it is by any measure of decency and liberalism a top-tier country . I am not aware of a boycott movement directed at , say , Pakistan . Or Turkey . Or Egypt . Or Venezuela . Or Russia . Or Burma . Or China . Or the Palestinian statelet , for that matter .\n( I once was accosted by one of those clipboard-wielding cretins in Union Square who wanted me to sign on to boycotting Israel on behalf of the Palestinians .

Why is the American Left fixated on the Jewish state ? Belgium can be pretty rough on refugees . Have you ever heard an American progressive collapse into a weeping fit about Belgium ? Israel , though . . .\nAnd , really , are Thomas Friedman et al . quite confident that it is Donald Trump and not , say , the people looking to economically ruin Israel as a pet political project , making the U.S.-Israeli relationship a partisan issue ?
