After polls closed Tuesday in San Antonio , hundreds of Beto O \u2019 Rourke supporters flocked to the Cowboys Dancehall for a rally . As the nine-piece band Shinyribs played , they lined up to buy O \u2019 Rourke T-shirts , took selfies with a neon \u201c Beto for Texas \u201d sign , and chatted near a mechanical bull . With a few notable exceptions , Representative O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s Senate campaign has been fueled by positivity and has attracted nationwide attention and record grass-roots fundraising . For this moment in time , it is an unorthodox approach , with other 2018 campaigns featuring accusations of racism , treason , and just plain old name-calling . Whether it will be enough for a Democrat to be elected to statewide office in Texas for the first time since 1994 is another question , but for a positive campaign to bring a liberal even this close , the statement may have already been made . \u201c In this midterm , we \u2019 ll see if that strategy of not going low works , \u201d says Mark Rodriguez , an O \u2019 Rourke supporter . \u201c I hope we don \u2019 t get to that point , that reasonable people can \u2019 t win . But you never really know . \u201d\nIt took less than 48 hours last week for Beto O \u2019 Rourke to express regret over attacking Ted Cruz , the United States senator he hopes to unseat this year .\nGrassroots energy , record fundraising hauls , and a Democrat actually being competitive statewide in ruby-red Texas have combined to make this one of the most closely-watched contests in the country . But Representative O \u2019 Rourke , a three-term congressman from El Paso , has also attracted supporters \u2013 and Internet celebrity \u2013 by running a largely positive campaign . In the months he has campaigned across the state he has rarely criticized Senator Cruz , saying he instead wants to focus on issues , inclusion , and optimism .\nPerhaps in a sign of the tenor of the times , he has departed from that approach in recent weeks , criticizing Cruz at events , in campaign ads , and during a statewide televised debate .\nWith O \u2019 Rourke trailing in the polls less than two weeks from election day , experts say the recent burst of negativity is a sign that a hitherto unconventional campaign is reverting to tried-and-tested methods . For his part , O \u2019 Rourke has vowed not to personally attack his opponent again . While a national ramp-up in negative political rhetoric is to be expected at this late point in a campaign cycle that has been nationalized in many corners as a referendum on President Trump , around the country it is reaching new levels of demonization and vitriol .\nTwo years after Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention \u201c when they go low , we go high , \u201d some prominent Democrats have said the party needs to , essentially , do and say whatever it takes to defeat Republicans this year . Republicans , meanwhile , have accused Democrats of treason and inciting \u201c mobs. \u201d This week , prominent Democratic leaders and critics of the president became the targets of pipe bombs . On Friday , law enforcement announced they had arrested a suspect in connection with the bombs .\nO \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s rise has been fueled by positivity , however , and while he has begun to criticize Cruz more , the attacks have rarely been personal . He has said they are necessary to push back against misleading criticisms of his record , but he has so far avoided going to extremes . For this moment in time it is an unorthodox approach .\n\u201c In this midterm , we \u2019 ll see if that strategy of not going low works , \u201d says Mark Rodriguez , an O \u2019 Rourke supporter . \u201c I hope we don \u2019 t get to that point , that reasonable people can \u2019 t win . But you never really know . \u201d\nWhether the balance O \u2019 Rourke is trying to strike will be enough for a Democrat to be elected to statewide office in Texas for the first time since 1994 is another question , but for a positive campaign to bring a Democrat even this close , the statement may have already been made .\nIt also stands in contrast with races elsewhere in the country . In a Florida gubernatorial debate , Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum said that , while he wouldn \u2019 t call his Republican opponent Ron DeSantis a racist , \u201c I \u2019 m simply saying the racists believe he \u2019 s a racist. \u201d In a heated Arizona Senate debate , Republican candidate Martha McSally accused her Democratic opponent Kyrsten Sinema of saying \u201c it \u2019 s OK to commit to treason. \u201d In New Jersey , Republican challenger Bob Hugin revived an unproven allegation that Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez had hired underage prostitutes , an attack ad The New York Times described as \u201c misleading . \u201d\nCivility and an emphasis on the personal have been features of O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s political brand . He has refused to take money from political action committees , but raised more than $ 61 million \u2013 double his opponent \u2013 through regular appeals for small donations . ( Outside groups have funded ads supporting both candidates . ) He held town halls in all 254 counties in Texas , crisscrossing the vast state in a fashion reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s helicopter-powered Senate campaign in 1948 , only with more selfies and Facebook livestreams .\nOne of O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s earliest forays into national news came in a road trip with GOP Rep. Will Hurd last year showing that politicians \u201c can disagree without being disagreeable. \u201d In a tweet , he criticized protesters who shouted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant . His Senate campaign gained national attention after a video of his defense of kneeling NFL players , in response to a question at a town hall in Houston , went viral .\n\u201c Reasonable people can disagree on this issue \u2026 and it makes them no less American , \u201d he said . \u201c I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up or take a knee for your rights . \u201d\nBoth reflect that while O \u2019 Rourke is undeniably liberal \u2013 his policy positions include universal health care and abortion rights \u2013 civil disagreement is at the core of his political brand .\nHis supporters say they gravitate to that sense of fair play .\n\u201c He \u2019 s running on just good values .
