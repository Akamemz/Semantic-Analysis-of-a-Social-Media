    "content_original": "(Thomas White/Reuters)\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nEarlier today the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. It\u2019s an interesting decision from an ideologically diverse judicial panel that at first glance appears to be a straightforward application of conventional First Amendment law. It\u2019s also wrong. It makes a crucial error that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms.\n\nBoiled down to its essence, the court\u2019s reasoning contained two key elements. First, it ruled that Trump\u2019s Twitter account represents an outlet for official communications and interactions that is controlled by President Trump. Second, it found that under these circumstances, Trump\u2019s decision to block users represents impermissible state action undertaken to suppress dissent.\n\nThe first element is fundamentally mistaken. By no traditional legal measure of \u201ccontrol\u201d does Trump control his Twitter account. Twitter owns and controls his account, and he has no legal right to wrest control of it from Twitter. The court\u2019s misunderstanding of the platform is made evident by this deeply flawed analysis:\n\nThe fact that government control over property is temporary, or that the government does not \u201cown\u201d the property in the sense that it holds title to the property, is not determinative of whether the property is, in fact, sufficiently controlled by the government to make it a forum for First Amendment purposes. See Se. Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 547\u201052 (1975) (holding privately\u2010owned theater leased to and operated by city was public forum). Temporary control by the government can still be control for First Amendment purposes.\n\nThere is no \u201ccontrol\u201d at all, temporary or otherwise. When a politician rents a theater or other private venue, there is typically an exchange of money and a rental agreement that explicitly grants enforceable legal rights to access the property and control others\u2019 access to the property, and \u2014 critically \u2014 limits the landlord\u2019s power during the course of the rental.\n\nCompare that level of control to the absolute lack of rights the user has under Twitter\u2019s terms of service:\n\nWe may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable.\n\nThere is no exchange of money, the user has no right to the platform, and Twitter can not only eliminate your access entirely but censor any single tweet. If it chooses, it can even remove Trump\u2019s ability to block, mute, or take any other action. And that\u2019s not all \u2014 when you use Twitter, your speech isn\u2019t even purely \u201cyour\u201d speech any longer. Twitter grants itself the right to your communications, too:\n\nBy submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).\n\nWriting in response to the trial court\u2019s ruling against Trump last year, law professor Greg Dolin compared Twitter to a radio call-in show that is hosting a government official as a guest. The politician has no right to be on the show, the host can send the politician packing at any time, and the host has ultimate control over not only the politician\u2019s presence but also any callers\u2019 speech. In other words, Trump remains on Twitter entirely at Twitter\u2019s discretion.\n\nIn that circumstance, there is no \u201cpublic forum.\u201d There is instead a public official using a private platform to attempt to amplify his specific message, with the permission of the entity that controls the platform.

I say no. The Second Circuit says yes.\n\nIt\u2019s common for social-media users to use phrases like \u201cmy Facebook page\u201d or \u201cmy Twitter feed.\u201d Yes, it is \u201cmy\u201d speech on social media, but it is not my page or my feed.
