He left after deciding that he was pushing \u201c weak and misleading \u201d science to buttress libertarian policies .\n\u201c Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right , \u201d says Jerry Taylor , president of the centrist Niskanen Center .\nThat the Heartland Institute calls itself a free-market think tank is telling : Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations , including curbs on carbon emissions , as leftist attacks on free enterprise .\n\u201c What they \u2019 re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they \u2019 re succeeding , \u201d one attendee at the Heartland Institute \u2019 s July conference in Washington , D.C. , told attendees .\nAfter years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science , a growing number of GOP lawmakers \u2013 from Lindsey Graham to Matt Gaetz \u2013 have begun to break ranks . But one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls . They maintain that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life .\nAs public concern over global warming grows , more Republicans have begun to break ranks . After years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science , GOP lawmakers are pivoting toward a belated acceptance of man-made warming and calling for bipartisan action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and boost investment in clean energy .\nBut one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls with warnings that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a climate delusion . It \u2019 s a climate collusion , \u201d James Taylor , a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute , told an audience of around 250 gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the institute \u2019 s 13th International Conference on Climate Change in late July .\nOther speakers argued that any warming of the Earth is part of a natural cycle and not the result of human activity , as record heat swept through Europe , toppling records in France , Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands .\nChicago-based Heartland is part of a nesting group of right-wing organizations that for decades have sought to undermine public confidence in mainstream climate science . It publishes \u201c climate realist \u201d books and articles that find their way into Republican platforms and into the media , and has tried to push materials into schools .\nThat it calls itself a free-market think tank is telling : Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations , including curbs on carbon emissions , as leftist attacks on free enterprise .\nTo such ideologues the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats in Congress is proof of their long-standing fear that a climate crisis is an excuse to re-engineer the U.S. economy as a top-down system .\nJay Lehr , a groundwater hydrologist , assured the Heartland conference that carbon emissions had \u201c zero effect \u201d on planetary temperatures and oceanic levels . Accepting the 2019 Dauntless Purveyor of Climate Truth Award , he said capitalism was under assault . \u201c What they \u2019 re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they \u2019 re succeeding . We \u2019 ve got to stop them , \u201d he said .\nCritics say this blending of fringe science and free-market fundamentalism is the handmaiden of fossil fuel producers seeking to protect their economic interests . Peer-reviewed studies have tracked how oil companies and major donors like the Koch Family Foundations influence the agenda of climate-skeptic organizations .\nBut their agendas also express a particular worldview , says Jean-Daniel Collomb , a French academic who studies U.S. political thought . To U.S. libertarians , such as the Koch brothers , who own oil refineries and pipelines that would be affected by carbon pricing , opposition to climate regulations is both self-serving \u2013 and an ideological exigency .\n\u201c They \u2019 re trying to salvage their profit margins but also to protect an approach to the economy that they favor , \u201d says Mr. Collomb , a professor of American studies at Jean Moulin University in Lyon , France . To take climate change seriously would be to open the door to a \u201c radical questioning of the way that you run your economy and the role of the government . \u201d\nMoreover , \u201c nobody likes to admit that they \u2019 re wrong , \u201d says Jerry Taylor , president of the Niskanen Center in Washington , a centrist think tank .\nHe should know : In his former role as director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute he took the skeptics \u2019 side , downplaying the risk of unchecked carbon emissions . He left Cato after 23 years in 2014 after deciding that he was pushing \u201c weak and misleading \u201d science to buttress libertarian policies . Now he favors carbon taxes and other market-based solutions .\n\u201c Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right , \u201d he says . \u201c If you accept the mainstream narrative about climate change it suggests a course of action that is anathema to people on the right . \u201d\nThose people include James Taylor , the Heartland senior fellow , who is his brother . Jerry Taylor says he \u2019 s given up trying to persuade him to reconsider his views . \u201c He \u2019 s a guy who is rewarded for being a gunslinger in this debate , and so was I , \u201d he says .\nThis ideological battle sets the United States apart from other countries where climate science is settled fact . In Europe , for example , several far-right parties like Alternative for Germany and the U.K . Independence Party are climate deniers , but none are in power . Britain \u2019 s Conservative-run government recently committed to zero carbon emissions by mid-century .\nBy contrast , climate deniers have a powerful ally in the White House . President Donald Trump , who disputes man-made warming and lauds coal and other fossil fuels , tapped a Heartland associate , Myron Ebell , to lead his transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency . Mr. Ebell told the conference that a \u201c deep state \u201d was thwarting President Trump \u2019 s climate agenda .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t do partisan politics , \u201d he said . \u201c But I would say this . ...

Virtually all of them have said they believe in keeping [ fossil fuels ] in the ground . \u201d\nDelegates heard a more supportive message from Tom McClintock , a Republican congressman from California . He conceded that \u201c temperatures are gently rising \u201d and \u201c oceans are slowly rising \u201d in a speech that disparaged Democrats as \u201c Chicken Littles \u201d for seeking curbs on fossil fuels , an industry that has funded his electoral campaigns .\nFor all the invective , some experts see an ongoing shift in the climate debate in which Heartland may be a lagging indicator of political and social change .\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which in 2009 claimed that carbon accumulation was beneficial for the planet , recently called for action on global warming , which it framed as a response to its members \u2019 desire to seek \u201c sensible solutions \u201d to a reality that was affecting their businesses .\nOthers making a similar pivot include Frank Luntz , a GOP pollster and strategist , who told a Senate committee last week that he regretted his past work to help to stall action on climate .

In April , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that clean-energy policy could be a winner for Republicans . \u201c If you want this party to grow \u2013 people from 18 to 35 believe in climate change whether you do or not , \u201d he told an Earth Day event in Dallas .\nMatt Gaetz , a Florida Republican and staunch Trump ally , has also tried to put a conservative stamp on climate policy with his \u201c Green Real Deal , \u201d which he introduced in the U.S. Congress in April .
