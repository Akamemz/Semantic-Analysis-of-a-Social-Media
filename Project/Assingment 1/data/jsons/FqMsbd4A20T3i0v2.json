Start your free trial .\nThe first thing Damiano Rizzi told me was the story of a woman who was about to die . It wasn \u2019 t Rizzi \u2019 s own story\u2014it was a story that another doctor had shared during a staff meeting . That doctor had been standing beside her patient \u2019 s bed . Before the patient closed her eyes , she stretched out her hand and placed it on the plastic visor that shielded her doctor \u2019 s face , as if looking for a last , desperate human touch .\nRizzi is the president of the health care NGO Soleterre , which works on human rights issues around health care . He \u2019 s also a psychologist at the San Matteo hospital in Pavia , one of the first cities affected by the COVID-19 emergency in Italy . He uses that doctor \u2019 s story as a portrait of what is happening in the wards of thousands of hospitals around the world . \u201c This virus has created a very strong sense of loneliness , \u201d he says . \u201c Doctors covered from head to toe in synthetic suits are the only link to real life for intubated patients , or imprisoned ones in oxygen helmets , often unable to say a word. \u201d For this reason , he and his team are on the front line , alongside the health personnel in the COVID-19 and intensive care units of the San Matteo hospital , to try to bring psychological support to this hell . \u201c We have been on the war front , in the Balkans , in the Donbass in Ukraine , in the refugee camps in northern Uganda . When the coronavirus emergency broke out , I felt it was important to be here . \u201d\nThere are many associations of psychologists who offer telephone consultations to health professionals , but almost no one is in the ward by their side because of the risk of infection . Right now , in Lombardy , the Italian region most affected by COVID-19 , the mental well-being of the patient and the caregiver is being treated equally . This emergency has kept health care workers in a state of continuous trauma for over a month . \u201c They are confused . Many find themselves doing a job they have never done , far from their departments , \u201d Rizzi says . \u201c Some experience survivor \u2019 s guilt , a classic for those who live through tragedies. \u201d They say they feel helpless , they are seeing many more people dying than they are used to seeing , they still don \u2019 t have the medicine to cure the disease , and sometimes they don \u2019 t even have the right protection . They are afraid of getting sick or infecting their loved ones .\nEvery morning , the doctors who work in the COVID-19 areas of San Gerardo Hospital in Monza do a briefing on their plan for the day to share data and general information with the medical director , Mario Alparone . Arianna Arcara\nOften , COVID-19 leads us to the metaphors of war and trenches . According to Rizzi , that is because we have no other words to explain this situation that has blown up our certainties . But he says that in some cases it is even worse than armed conflict . \u201c During a war there are the battles that require a maximum state of mental alert , but then there is time to relax , or times when someone else goes to the front line . Here , on the other hand , there is a constant stress : during the battle in the wards , but also at home , where they are afraid of bringing the virus into the family . \u201d\nMany doctors and nurses have decided to move away from loved ones , such as Pierluigi Viale , the director of infectious diseases at Sant \u2019 Orsola-Malpighi Polyclinic in Bologna : \u201c I have been living alone at my mother-in-law \u2019 s house for several weeks . She moved in with my wife and our 4-year-old son . I come back late from work . Sometimes I stop by under their balcony and blow a kiss from the car . My son yells , \u2018 Daddy , be careful ! \u2019 And I go away with my heart in pieces . It is not easy to live this moment without them , without a hug .

Arianna Arcara\nWhile in America and other countries , the virus still on the rise , the advance of the pandemic in Italy appears to be slightly slowing down . The cases of the total infected are more than 140,000 , and new infections are decreasing . Of these 140,000 cases , 10,000 are health care workers , twice as many as those in China . One figure is particularly worrisome : 100 doctors have died since the outbreak . One hundred doctors in just a month . They died from working on the front line ; they died because without the right protective devices it \u2019 s easier to get sick . And the problem is not solely Italian .

Two nurses have already died there .\nIsabel Fernandez is a psychotherapist who specializes in emergencies . She is at the forefront of listening to health personnel . Knowing that a colleague from another department or from another hospital is infected , or seeing a colleague die , creates a great trauma in health workers , she says : \u201c It becomes an image that creeps into your head and reminds you that the next one could be you .
