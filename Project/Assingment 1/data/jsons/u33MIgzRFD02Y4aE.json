    "content": "This is a glorious week indeed for Kim Jong Un \u2019 s dwindling little family business in Pyongyang . Finally , finally\u2014to be taken seriously . To get people to pay attention and not laugh at the same time ( not too much , anyway ) . The North Korean regime\u2014which is to say three generations of Kims\u2014has spent its entire , bizarre existence on earth trying to get people to notice them . And rarely succeeding , at least since the Korean War ended 61 years ago . It can hardly be an accident that the very thing that apparently set the young great-and-dear leader off this time was a movie that took him so unseriously it decided that the idea of his assassination was a terrific premise for a comedy .\nNow the enemies of the regime\u2014the \u201c running dogs , \u201d \u201c jackals \u201d and \u201c militarist maniacs \u201d decried for decades by the North \u2019 s ever-creative news agency\u2014are paying dearly . Not only did Pyongyang reportedly manage to threaten a major multinational corporation into pulling its film , and embarrass the hell out of Hollywood royalty by publishing their emails for weeks , the North \u2019 s \u201c Unit 121 \u201d \u2014the cyberhacking outfit reportedly working out of North Korea \u2019 s military spy agency , the General Bureau of Reconnaissance\u2014was able to simultaneously one-up two countries Pyongyang hates most , the United States and Japan , where of course Sony Pictures \u2019 parent is based . \u201c Kim Jong Won , \u201d the New York Post headline shouted . \u201c I \u2019 ve got to believe that this will spook anybody from considering making the North Koreans bad guys in a film , \u201d movie producer Bill Gerber told the Los Angeles Times . Even if some experts are skeptical whether the regime was responsible for the hack , Kim \u2019 s getting all the credit anyway .\nSo , yes , this is a week that is destined to be commemorated in song and art in Pyongyang , the way the rusting old hulk of the USS Pueblo still draws museum goers downtown , marking that previous glorious moment in 1968 ( the seizure of a U.S. intelligence ship , its captain and its crew ) that North Korean regime types recall as if it were yesterday even if everyone else has long since forgotten it . In fact , Kim and Co. might be wondering , just about now , whether they \u2019 ve been going the wrong route all these years with their vastly ambitious if often errant nuclear program , which starved their nation and condemned generations of nuclear scientists to horrific radiation deaths .\nInternet terrorism is much cheaper , safer\u2014and probably far more effective . Threaten people from the ether , and you can scare everybody , even Hollywood . \u201c The downside was too dramatic versus the upside , \u201d Mark Cuban told CNN , explaining the decision of his marquee theater in New York to cancel a premiere for The Interview after apparent threats that it and other theaters would be targeted . White House spokesman Josh Earnest paid Kim yet another compliment on Thursday when he described the Sony hack attack as \u201c destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor. \u201d Sophisticated and malicious\u2014does it get any better than that ? Until this week Kim \u2019 s best moment since taking over as leader has been the occasional visits of Dennis Rodman . So you can imagine what this means to him .\nNow there is every reason to expect that the Kim family business\u2014which until now has mainly consisted of \u201c nuclear blackmail , \u201d as the Bush administration once called it\u2014will expand dramatically into the more profitable territory of cyberspace . Nuclear blackmail , to be sure , has occasionally worked . Like his father , Kim Jong Il , the younger Kim has to use the combined threats of the North \u2019 s nuke technology and its military \u2019 s proximity to Seoul and U.S. troops in order to extract food and fuel aid to his self-impoverished country . Pyongyang also became the world \u2019 s No . 1 missile proliferator , cutting deals with Pakistan among others . This persistent threat has yielded returns ever since the \u201c Framework agreement \u201d launched by Bill Clinton in 1994 , and under which the North offered to freeze and \u201c eventually \u201d dismantle its plutonium program in exchange for 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil each year and billions of dollars \u2019 worth of civilian nuclear equipment . Every few years they \u2019 ve managed to pop off a nuke test to get the West to pay attention again\u2014even the Bush administration eventually came around . Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter was so alarmed by Pyongyang \u2019 s proliferation he once called for strikes to counter the North Korean missile program .\nYet in the end the West has always grown bored and , worse , reverted to making fun of the Kims \u2019 lonely Stalinist regime , which has been cordoned off from the world for six decades , festering amid East Asia \u2019 s glittering successes like a political toxic-waste site . ( George W. Bush \u2019 s favorite photo illustrating the virtues of freedom was said to be a satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night , which showed bright lights over the prosperous South and darkness over the power-starved North ) .\nTo fully appreciate what the North \u2019 s victory over Sony this week signifies in Pyongyang , one must gauge the mind-boggling depths of the regime \u2019 s insecurity . Bush\u2014who was said to have suffered from insecurity problems himself\u2014once called the 5-foot-3 Kim Jong Il a \u201c pygmy \u201d who behaved like \u201c a spoiled child at a dinner table. \u201d After those remarks and other personal cracks by Bush were reported in Newsweek and other Western publications , North Korean officials would regularly complain about them . \u201c How can we deal with you when your leader doesn \u2019 t show us even a minimum of respect ? \u201d the North Korean vice minister of foreign affairs , Kim Gye Gwan , complained to Washington-based Korea scholar Selig Harrison in 2004 .\nEven the North Korean regime \u2019 s ideology , called juche , remains a strange blend of utopian Marxism-Leninism and xenophobic insecurity . During my only trip to North Korea in the fall of 2000 , as part of the journalistic troupe accompanying then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , I discovered this sensitivity myself by touching off a mini-diplomatic incident . A group of us were taken on an expedition around the city to visit some of the grandiose monuments to Kim \u2019 s grandfather , the founder of the Revolutionary Workers Party , Kim Il Sung . At one stop , a pavilion capped by a 100-foot-high statue of the \u201c Great Leader \u201d ( he died in 1994 ) , a reporter friend asked me to take a picture of her in the pose of Kim , who had his arm raised in a benevolent gesture to the masses . As I prodded her to adjust her position , a Japanese reporter made the mistake of chuckling at our antics . Suddenly State Department officials were buzzing around us worriedly , and the North Koreans angrily shooed us away from the monument and onto a bus . My North Korean \u201c minder \u201d Li Wong Su explained furiously : \u201c You people in the West don \u2019 t understand how we feel about this man ! \u201d By the end of the trip Li , a short 29-year-old with thick black hair , had put on a pair of large sunglasses to hide the large contusion under his right eye that , one U.S. official noted to me , \u201c he didn \u2019 t have when we first got here. \u201d ( I wasn \u2019 t able to get a straight answer from Li about how he got it : \u201c I fainted , \u201d he said at first , averting his face . Then later : \u201c I bumped into a wall . \u201d )\nNow Kim \u2019 s grandson\u2014who is said to resemble Kim Il Sung and plays the part , with his \u2018 50s-style prison haircut and Mao suit\u2014has truly proved himself to be a chunky chip off the old block .
