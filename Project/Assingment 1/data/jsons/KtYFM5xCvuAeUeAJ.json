If so , there \u2019 s remarkably little discussion of the world in the 2020 race so far . Despite polls showing that nearly 6 in 10 voters believe President Donald Trump has made America less respected in the world , the candidate most directly challenging him on foreign policy is 40-year-old dark horse Seth Moulton , a third-term congressman from Massachusetts .\nOf all the Democrats vying to be leader of the free world , Seth Moulton may be the only one who actually talks much about the world .\nAn ex-Marine who served four combat tours in Iraq , Representative Moulton of Massachusetts has tried to stand out in the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates by emphasizing military and foreign-policy issues . He says it \u2019 s important for his party to highlight the hash President Donald Trump has made of the U.S. global role by alienating allies and embracing authoritarians .\n\u201c I think we have a historic opportunity to reclaim the mantle of leadership on national security , \u201d he says between campaign stops in New Hampshire in which he calls for Democrats to quit ceding patriotism to Republicans . \u201c I don \u2019 t know why so many Democrats are passing it up , but I \u2019 m not going to pass it up . \u201d\nLet Joe Biden emphasize electability .

Mr. Moulton remains a blip in the polls , far behind the leaders . There may be multiple reasons he has yet to catch fire , but one could be this : Foreign policy is a difficult electoral issue .\nForeign issues seldom sway voters , particularly in primaries . For candidates , they can be tripping hazards best avoided . It \u2019 s easy to make a foreign-policy gaffe \u2013 mispronouncing a foreign leader \u2019 s name , say , or placing their nation on the wrong continent . But it \u2019 s hard to get a campaign rally excited by calls to \u201c support the liberal international order . \u201d\nStill , 2020 could be different . Mr. Trump \u2019 s disruptive approach to foreign policy , from his threats to Iran to his denigration of longtime NATO allies , may indeed have made some voters wary . Fifty-seven percent of likely voters believe Mr. Trump has \u201c made America less respected around the world , \u201d according to a new poll from National Security Action , a Democratic-leaning group . Sixty-seven percent think Mr. Trump \u201c lacks the temperament \u201d to be commander in chief .\nChrista Case Bryant/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Rep.

Ms. Moulton has said that the person who challenges Donald Trump 'needs to be a tank \u2026 and that \u2019 s Seth . '\nWhoever emerges as the Democratic nominee could attack Mr. Trump directly on his record as head of the U.S. armed forces , despite the Republican Party \u2019 s customary advantage on security and foreign issues .
