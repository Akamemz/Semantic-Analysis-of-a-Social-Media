    "content": "President Trump portrayed a very dark picture of America during a speech on Friday that returned to one of his favorite themes from the campaign : Immigrants are bringing drugs , crime , and violence to the US and must be stopped .\nAmid a recent uptick in gang violence in suburban Long Island , Trump portrayed the fight as an all-out war between US officials and the MS-13 gang . He called gang members \u201c animals \u201d and repeatedly said police are \u201c liberating \u201d multiple towns and cities across the United States . He suggested cops and immigration enforcement agents should act more violently toward the people they arrest .\nTrump \u2019 s language was meant to add \u201c power and poignancy \u201d to a request to Congress for more funding for his signature border wall and additional resources to curb unauthorized immigration , his aides told reporters . The result was a bleak picture of American immigration \u2014 and a suggestion that law enforcement should use whatever means necessary to get violence under control .\nHere are seven key passages from the speech ( emphasis added ) .\n\u201c MS-13 is particularly violent . They do n't like shooting people because it 's too quick . It 's too fast . I was reading one of these animals was caught and explaining they like to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly because that way it 's more painful . And they enjoy watching that much more . \u201d\n2 ) He blamed gang violence on children who came to the US seeking asylum\n\u201c In the three years before I took office , more than 150,000 unaccompanied alien minors arrived at the border and were released all throughout our country into United States communities . At a tremendous monetary cost to local taxpayers and also a great cost to life and safety . Nearly 4,000 from this wave were released into Suffolk County . Congratulations . Including seven who are now indicted for murder . \u201d\n3 ) He blamed \u201c weak policing \u201d and restrictions on police power for gang violence\n\u201c They 're there right now because of weak political leadership , weak leadership , weak policing , and in many cases because the police were n't allowed to do their job . I 've met police that are great police that are n't allowed to do their job because they have a pathetic mayor or a mayor who does n't know what 's going on . \u201d\n4 ) He claimed laws were unfair to police and \u201c made to protect the criminal \u201d\n\u201c The laws are so horrendously stacked against us , because for years and years , they 've been made to protect the criminal . Totally made to protect the criminal . Not the officers . You do something wrong , you 're in more jeopardy than they are . These laws are stacked against you . We 're changing those laws . But in the meantime , we need judges for the simplest thing , things that you should be able to do without a judge , but we have to have those judges quickly . \u201d\n\u201c Think of it . They butchered those little girls . They kidnap . They extort . They rape and they rob . They prey on children . They should n't be here . They stomp on their victims . They beat them with clubs .
