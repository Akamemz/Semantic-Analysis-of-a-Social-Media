    "content": "Egypt 's interim president has issued a swift timetable for the process of amending the embattled country 's constitution , setting parliamentary and presidential elections for early 2014 .\nUnder the constitutional declaration by Adly Mansour late Monday , he would create two appointed committees to work out amendments to the Islamist-drafted constitution passed under ousted President Mohammed Morsi .\nA referendum on the new document would be held within four months .\nElections for a new parliament would be held within two months after that , around mid-February . Once the new parliament convenes , it would have a week to set new presidential elections .\nThe declaration came after clashes with security forces early Monday left more than 50 Morsi supporters dead . Both sides exchanged blame over who sparked the bloodshed . The toppled leader 's Muslim Brotherhood called for an uprising , accusing troops of gunning down protesters , while the military blamed armed Islamists for provoking its forces .\nThe early morning carnage at a sit-in by Islamists outside the Republican Guard headquarters , where Morsi was first held last week , further entrenched the battle lines between the ousted president supporters and his opponents . The uproar weakened the political coalition that backed the military 's removal of the country 's first freely elected leader .\nEgypt 's top Muslim cleric , the sheik of Al-Azhar , warned of civil war and took the unusual step of announcing he would seclude himself in his home until the two sides `` stop the bloodshed . ''\nThe sole Islamist faction that backed Morsi 's removal , the ultraconservative Al-Nour Party , suspended its participation in talks on forming a new leadership for the country . The group is now torn by pressure from many in its base , furious over what they saw as a `` massacre '' against Islamists .\nBoth the military and the Muslim Brotherhood appeared determined not to back down in the confrontation . The Brotherhood accuses the military of carrying out a coup against democracy , while their opponents say Morsi squandered his 2012 election victory and led the country into a Brotherhood monopoly on power .\nThe Freedom and Justice party , the Muslim Brotherhood 's political arm , called on Egyptians to rise up against the army , which it accused of turning Egypt into `` a new Syria . ''\nThe new military-backed leadership , meanwhile , pushed ahead with its post-Morsi political plans , working on a timetable for new presidential elections and a new Cabinet .\n`` This could be a moment of extremism for both sides '' of the equation , Mohammed Mahsoub , a member of the Islamist Wasat Party , told Al-Jazeera TV .\nImmediately after the clashes Monday , both sides presented their versions of what happened at the protest site , where about 1,000 Morsi supporters had been camped out for days in the streets around a mosque near the Republican Guard Headquarters . After the violence began around dawn , the two sides battled for around three hours .\nProtesters and the Brotherhood said the bloodshed began when troops descended on them and opened fire unprovoked as they finished dawn prayers .\n`` I was in the last row praying . They were firing from the left and right , '' said Nashat Mohammed , who had come from southern Egypt to join the sit-in and was wounded in the knee in the mayhem . `` We said , 'Stop , we 're your brothers . ' They shot at us from every direction . ''\nSpokesmen for the military and police , however , gave a nationally televised news conference saying gunmen among the protesters sparked the battle .\nArmy Col. Ahmed Mohammed Ali said police and troops guarding the Republican Guard complex came under `` heavy gunfire '' at around 4 a.m. and attackers on rooftops opened fire with guns and molotov cocktails . A soldier and two policemen were killed , and 42 in the security forces were wounded , eight critically , he said .\nWhile he said troops had a right to defend the facility , Ali did not directly explain how the protester deaths occurred . He expressed condolences but offered no apologies for the deaths .\nA collection of footage of the clashes provided by the military , aired on Egyptian TV stations , showed protesters on rooftops lobbing projectiles at troops below , including fire bombs and toilet seats . It also showed some armed protesters firing at close range at the troops , but it showed no footage of what the military did . It was also not clear at what time in the fighting the videos were shot . It included aerial views of the clashes .\nSeveral witnesses from outside the protest said the gunfire started when troops appeared to move on the camp .\nUniversity student Mirna el-Helbawi told The Associated Press that she watched from her 14th floor apartment overlooking the scene after she heard protesters banging on metal barricades , a common battle cry . El-Helbawi , 21 , said she saw troops and police approaching the protesters , who were lined up on the street behind a makeshift wall . The troops fired tear gas , the protesters responded with rocks , she said .\nSoon after , she heard the first gunshots and saw the troops initially retreat backward \u2014 which she said led her to believe the shots came from the protester side . She saw Morsi supporters firing from rooftops while the troops were also shooting .\nBy the end , at least 51 protesters were killed and 435 wounded , most from live ammunition and birdshot , according to the state news agency .\nReeling from scenes of bloodied protesters in hospitals and clinics , many with gaping wounds , some of the country 's politicians tried to push new plans for some sort of reconciliation in the deeply polarized nation .\nSheik Ahmed el-Tayeb , the grand imam of Al-Azhar , the most prominent Sunni Muslim institution , demanded that a reconciliation panel with full powers immediately start work and that those detained in recent days be released .
