    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nJoe Biden has a lot of friends who\u2019ve been busily explaining away his too touchy-feely behaviors lately as little misunderstandings \u2014 that the former vice president is simply affectionate and nice, more like a favorite family \u201cuncle\u201d of the effervescent variety than creepy or predatory.\n\nThese defenders are wrong. Do they not have eyes to see? Even calling Biden \u201cuncle,\u201d or any politician, in fact, is weird.\n\nBut more than that: Does Biden himself not know that his behaviors are wrong? And if not, why not? He\u2019s 76 years old, well past the age of reason. He\u2019s also a seasoned politician, trained to read people in order to bend their political wills. Are we to believe that it\u2019s escaped Biden\u2019s notice that he\u2019s got the brand of a predatory creep?\n\nYet Americans seem confused.\n\nSo let\u2019s get this straight, straight off the top: Just because someone seems nice, doesn\u2019t mean that person can\u2019t also be a creep. Just because someone carries groceries for a neighbor, helps an elderly lady across the street, smiles and tells jokes and charms groups of people, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re Polly pure on the inside.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski rose to Biden\u2019s defense on a recent \u201cMorning Joe\u201d segment, saying it\u2019d be \u201csad\u201d if Biden had to stop hugging people just because of a few bad seed female accusers.\n\nReally? Pragmatic might be a better word. Polite, even. Or proper.\n\nHer words, as captured on Mediaite: \u201c[Biden\u2018s] a nice guy, he\u2019s not a predator, and this is ridiculous. Let me just say it, this is ridiculous. \u2026 [T]he conversation has gotten out of control. And Democrats and those on the left who want to tweet me today and go nuts and get all woke, you\u2019re eating your young. You\u2019re eating those who can beat Trump, you\u2019re killing the very people who have been pushing women ahead, who\u2019ve been fighting for equal pay, who have been doing everything they can to respect women in their lives.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s defenders aren\u2019t confined to his own liberal camp.\n\nMeghan McCain, the Republican voice of \u201cThe View,\u201d said in a tweet: Leave my buddy, Joe, alone.\n\nShe put it this way: \u201cJoe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics. He has helped me through my father\u2019s diagnosis, treatment and ultimate passing more than any one of my fathers\u2019 friends combined. I wish there was more empathy from our politicians not less.\u201d\n\nCome on now, people.\n\nBiden is a creep. He\u2019s been a creep for a long time, toward a lot of people, in a lot of different settings.\n\n\u201cBiden Swims Naked, Upsetting Female Secret Service Agents, Book Claims,\u201d reported U.S. News in an August 2014 headline.\n\n\u201cWhat Are We Going To Do About Creepy Uncle Joe Biden?\u201d wrote The Washington Post, in a February 2015 headline.\n\nTwitter threads have even been dedicated to discussing Biden\u2019s untoward behaviors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to talk about former Vice President Joe Biden, the open sexual predator. A thread/moment,\u201d wrote Richard Armande Mills, an activist and content creator tied, at least at one point, to Turning Point USA. This thread, from November 2017, was shared more than 39,000 times and commented upon more than 2,500 times.\n\nIn other words: the jig is up.\n\nBiden\u2019s reputation is out there.\n\nIt\u2019s talked about, both discussed and whispered, captured on video, shared on social media and treated as topic for numerous commentaries and articles.\n\nThere\u2019s no way Biden isn\u2019t aware of his reputation.\n\nSo that leads to this main question: Why hasn\u2019t Biden changed?\n\nWhat kind of man knows he has a reputation as a lech, as a creep, as someone who makes women and girls uncomfortable with his intrusive, unasked-for touches \u2014 and doesn\u2019t change?\n\nA \u201cdecent\u201d man, as McCain calls him? A \u201cnice guy,\u201d as Brzezinski insists?\n\nIf so, America\u2019s standards of decency have fallen too low.\n\nHere\u2019s a refresher. A decent man, when confronted with the truths of his indecent behaviors toward women, should adjust his behaviors. A nice guy, when informed of how his actions toward little girls cause feelings of discomfort, should change how he acts around little girls \u2014 even if he truly means no harm, even if he genuinely believes he\u2019s simply being affectionate, or friendly, or innocently kind. He changes because he\u2019s shocked someone would think something wicked of him and he wants to set the record straight. He changes because he wants to make others comfortable, not uncomfortable.\n\nBiden, age 76, has had plenty of time and opportunity to realize the folly of his behavioral ways and adjust accordingly.
