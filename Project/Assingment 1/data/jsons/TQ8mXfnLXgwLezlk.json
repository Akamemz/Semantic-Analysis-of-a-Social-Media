They have never seen all four of those items in the same place at the same time .

I received responses from both . From the vice-chair of her campaign , Huma Abedin , I received a very courteous note thanking me for supporting her candidate and wishing me much success with the book . And from \u201c Team Trump \u201d I received a thank you letter and two bumper stickers that say ( guess what ? ) : \u201c Make America Great Again ! \u201d\nBut let me set the record straight . When \u201c Team Trump \u201d told me they were \u201c honored to call me a valuable member of our team and to work with us on rescuing the future of our country , \u201d I realized that they had not taken my letter seriously .

Carefully positioned behind Hillary so that the cameras would see her , a lone dissenter held up a cloth banner that read \u201c Stop DNC Corruption \u201d and shouted out the same message denouncing the Democratic National Committee . But Clinton supporters around her held up their blue placards with the words \u201c Stronger Together \u201d so that she and her protest sign soon became invisible .\nIt is just one detail on the campaign trail , of course . But it was a telling moment because it reminds us that \u201c stronger together \u201d is not just a slogan for getting elected . Just as the words \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d can not be reduced to blindly endorsing an egomaniac , \u201c Stronger Together \u201d can not be reduced to rallying around one remarkable woman .
