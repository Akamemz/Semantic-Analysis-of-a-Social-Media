    "content": "Democrats and the media have been pounding President Donald Trump over the past few days , as Hurricane Florence nears the Carolinas , over his alleged insensitivity to deaths in Puerto Rico last year from Hurricane Maria .\nOn Thursday morning , President Trump pushed back on Twitter , alleging that Democrats had inflated the death toll \u201c in order to make me look as bad as possible . \u201d\nThat led to more criticism , with the Associated Press accusing Trump of making claims \u201c without evidence . \u201d\nHis opponents \u2014 including the media \u2014 have strained for more than a year to turn Hurricane Maria into his version of Hurricane Katrina , the devastating 2005 storm that prompted criticism of President George W. Bush \u2019 s response \u2014 even though state and local authorities had been far worse \u2014 and foreshadowed a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 .\nLeading the charge was CNN , which made a special effort to link Hurricane Maria in 2017 to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , and made a temporary media sensation of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz , who accused the Trump administration of neglect .\nHowever , the media \u2019 s effort at the time was frustrated by several factors . First , experts praised the federal government \u2019 s response to Hurricane Maria , which posed special challenges because Puerto Rico is so far from the mainland U.S .\nSecond , Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 himself praised the federal government \u2019 s response : \u201c \u201c The president and the administration , every time we \u2019 ve asked them to execute , they \u2019 ve executed quickly , \u201d he told Fox News in September 2017 .\nThird , Puerto Rico was already something of a disaster before the hurricane hit , thanks to mismanagement by the territory \u2019 s government that led to a debt crisis in recent years . ( Mayor Cruz herself is reportedly under FBI investigation for corruption . )\nHowever , Trump \u2019 s critics did not give up . Over the past several months , they have attempted to cite several new studies that created new estimates of the \u201c real \u201d death toll of Hurricane Maria \u2014 based on statistical models , not on actual death counts .\nMany studies addressed a real concern that the Puerto Rican government lacked the competence to do an accurate death count , but much of the media hype around the results was clearly motivated by the attempt to damage the Trump administration .\nThe Washington Post noted just some of the studies as of June 2018 ( original links ) :\nUniversity of Puerto Rico-Mayag\u00fcez professors calculated 822 , with a 95 percent confidence range that the total was somewhere between 605 and 1,039 .\nPennsylvania State University professors calculated excess deaths of about 500 in September , or a total of 1,085 if the same pattern held in October . That estimate was based on six weeks of mortality records .\nA Latino USA analysis , using updated data from Puerto Rico \u2019 s Department of Health , calculated 1,194 excess deaths in September and October .\nThe Post noted that the new estimates hovered around the 1,000 mark .\nThen , in June , a Harvard study published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated the number of deaths from Hurricane Maria at 4,645 instead of the official figure of 64 . The researchers had conducted a survey and extrapolated the results \u2014 an extremely sloppy methodology .\nEven the Post was skeptical of the absurdly high estimate : \u201c This is not a verified number , unlike body counts in wars . The Harvard study offers only an estimate \u2013 a midpoint along a broad range of possibilities . It is not based on death records , only estimates of deaths from people who were interviewed in a survey . \u201d\nLast month , a new study was produced by George Washington University that estimated the \u201c excess mortality \u201d from Hurricane Maria over a six-month period at 2,975 within a 95 % confidence interval of 2,658-3,290 \u201c excess \u201d deaths .\nThis was the second-highest estimate after the faulty Harvard study , and was based on a statistical model that subtracted the number of people who theoretically should have died over the same period from the number of people who actually died during that time .\nIt is also a rather useless way of comparing death tolls , because in order to evaluate the relative scale of Hurricane Maria , the same method would have to be used to measure other natural disasters , likely increasing their estimated death tolls as well .\nThe media reported the new estimate as if it were an actual confirmed death toll \u2014 with CNN taking care to note that the new number was released near the anniversary of Katrina . The Puerto Rican governor , under heavy political pressure due to the slow pace of the island \u2019 s recovery , officially revised the death toll to match the estimate .\nThat gave the media an excuse to throw out science and statistics , and to report the 2.975 number as an established fact \u2014 even though it was just an estimate based on a statistical model , and three times higher than all but one of the previous estimates .\nThe AP reported earlier this week that \u201c 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico \u201d in Hurricane Maria \u2014 as if it were a proven fact .
