According to Nancy Pelosi , you \u2019 re a brain-cell away from being declared mentally unfit , so I hope this clears things up .

Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) complained of \u201c the discomfort of being a second-class citizen \u201d before claiming the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u201c was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something , and [ Muslims ] were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. \u201d Some people did something ? Wow . What a way to describe the heinous surprise attack on America that claimed 3,000 lives . Especially when Omar \u2019 s focus was Muslim rights : That made it all the more vital to note that the terrorists acted in the name of Islam \u2014 as self-described \u201c jihadists \u201d in a war against America , Israel and the West . To call them merely \u201c some people \u201d is to deny a cancer festering in the world Muslim community . She went further : \u201c Many people expect our community to feel like it needs to hide every time something happens. \u201d Again , by \u201c something happens , \u201d she means ( but won \u2019 t say ) \u201c when Muslims commit acts of terror. \u201d No one expects Muslims to \u201c hide \u201d after an attack by Islamist terrorists . No group should be blamed for the deeds of a few of its members . But defeating terrorism requires facing the facts of who \u2019 s behind it and why . Instead , Omar claimed Muslims are being \u201c terrorized \u201d by the nation \u2019 s response to 9/11 . By the way : CAIR wasn \u2019 t founded post-9/11 , but in 1994 . And the feds later named it an unindicted co-conspirator in a plot to steer US funds to the terror group Hamas .\nWell , she has been allegedly holding secret fundraisers for such groups . But let \u2019 s just say that Omar doesn \u2019 t know what she \u2019 s talking about . After all , again , Pelosi used this line to defend Omar after her series of anti-Semitic rants that were widely reported . The latest episode involved her accusing supporters of Israel for having dual loyalty , which is one of the oldest anti-Jewish tropes out there . She \u2019 s too dumb to know what she \u2019 s saying , so she \u2019 s not an anti-Semite . Yeah , that \u2019 s not going to fly .
