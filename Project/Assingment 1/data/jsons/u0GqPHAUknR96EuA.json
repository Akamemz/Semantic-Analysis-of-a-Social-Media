He was drafted by his colleagues . And with little prospect of being able to achieve more of his agenda , Ryan decided to declare victory after helping to pass the tax cuts and stop being a `` weekend dad '' back in Janesville , Wis .\nThe pundits raced to read a whole lot more into his decision .\nRyan was `` signaling the peril that the Republican majority faces in the midterm elections , '' The New York Times says .\nRyan is `` adding further uncertainty about whether embattled Republicans can maintain control of the House , '' says The Washington Post .\nNow I 'm sure the GOP 's challenging prospects in the midterms crossed the congressman 's mind , despite his demurral yesterday . But he \u2019 s not the typical power-hungry pol , so I do n't think that 's his main motivation . Nor do I believe Ryan 's absence on the ballot will hurt other Republican candidates , except perhaps for the loss of his fundraising prowess .\nCNBC 's John Harwood goes a step further . `` Ryan \u2019 s retirement from the House increases the chance that President Donald Trump will be impeached , '' he says .\nBecause `` there 's little doubt that a Democratic-controlled House would seek to impeach the president . ''\nWait , so Nancy Pelosi and company are lying when they say they \u2019 re not pursuing impeachment ?\nHarwood sees it as a runaway train . Still , a pretty sweeping conclusion based on one lawmaker giving up his seat .\nIt became awkward watching Ryan at his news conferences , deflecting reporters ' questions about the latest Trump scandal or tweet and struggling to talk about policy .\nWhat strikes me is how some Trump loyalists are trashing Ryan online , even calling him a RINO . That shows how much the party 's center of gravity has shifted .\nRyan was long viewed as a dogged crusader for smaller government . When Mitt Romney picked him as his running mate , the right cheered at such a conservative choice .\nBut Ryan 's devotion to entitlement reform was utterly at odds with Trump 's vow to protect Medicare and Social Security .
