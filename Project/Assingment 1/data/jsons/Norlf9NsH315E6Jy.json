''\nObama 's speech made repeated references to Berlin 's post-war history and the resiliency of its people . He called on them to manifest the same spirit that helped bring down the Berlin Wall to now take on broader challenges facing the modern world .\n`` Complacency is not the character of great nations , '' said the president , who perspired openly despite removing his suit jacket when he started speaking to a sun-drenched crowd . `` Today 's threats are not as stark as they were half-a-century ago . But the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity , that struggle goes on . ''\nJUST WATCHED Obama speaks against nuclear weapons Replay More Videos ...

''\nIn the city rife with Cold War history , Obama also heralded democratic values that helped end communist control .\n`` Because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom , we can say here in Berlin , here in Europe : Our values won , '' he said to cheers . `` Openness won . Tolerance won . And freedom won . ''\nObama 's speech took place almost exactly 50 years after President John F. Kennedy delivered his `` Ich bin ein Berliner '' -- or `` I am a Berliner '' -- speech of solidarity with West Berlin near the dividing line with the Soviet-occupied east on the other side of the Berlin Wall .\nBerlin is also where President Ronald Reagan delivered a famous line to the Soviet Union in 1987 : `` Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ! ''\nWhen Obama referred to Kennedy 's speech and repeated the famous phrase , the crowd cheered . He also quoted from Kennedy 's speech by calling on people to look `` to the day of peace with justice , beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind . ''\nTaking on another major issue , Obama called for a new global effort to address climate change , citing threats such as `` more severe storms , more famine and floods , new waves of refugees , coast lines that vanish , oceans that rise .
