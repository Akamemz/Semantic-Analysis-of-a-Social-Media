In truth , the economy has mounted a steady recovery since the Great Recession of 2007-09 , marking the longest expansion in American history .\n\u201c You have seen a continuation of the trend , \u201d says Elise Gould , senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute .\nWater cooler rage : Should you talk about politics and Trump at the office ?\nMoney cheaters : Hidden accounts , secret debts are things Americans do behind their partners ' back\nTrump : \u201c The years of economic decay are over , \u201d he said . \u201c In just three short years , we have shattered the mentality of American decline . \u201d\nFacts : Obama spearheaded an economic stimulus that 's credited with helping dig the nation out of recession . The economy grew an average 2.2 % a year during Obama \u2019 s tenure . That \u2019 s a bit less than the 2.5 % average under Trump .

About 6.7 million jobs have been added since his term began in late January 2017 .
