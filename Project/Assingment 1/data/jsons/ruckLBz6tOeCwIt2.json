    "content": "INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The commercial opens with an appeal to fear : a hoodie-wearing man prowling an alley , knife in hand . His face remains hidden but the ad makes it clear : He \u2019 s an illegal immigrant .\n\u201c We need tough immigration enforcement to keep dangerous criminals out , \u201d says the ad by a national conservative political group , part of an effort to help a Republican challenger , Mike Braun , oust a Democratic incumbent in Indiana and capture a U.S. Senate seat in November \u2019 s congressional elections .\nAs they try to hang on to control of Congress , Republican candidates are following the lead of President Donald Trump and turning to rhetoric about immigrants as a tactic to motivate voters . The scope of that strategy emerges in a nationwide \u2588\u2588\u2588 examination of ad buys , candidates \u2019 social media posts and polling , as well as dozens of interviews with candidates , voters and campaign strategists .\nThe trend is especially visible on Twitter . Congressional Republicans seeking re-election have dramatically increased the number of tweets they post about immigration since Trump \u2019 s election , a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos analysis of social media shows . Immigration messaging has surged across the spectrum of Republican-held districts \u2013 highly competitive swing seats and reliably Republican ones , in places with immigrant populations both large and small .\nThe shift also shows up in the campaign ad wars . In races from Florida to California , in border states and ones with few immigrants , Republicans have poured millions of dollars into advertising that depict illegal immigrants as criminals and vowed enthusiastic support for Trump \u2019 s proposed wall at the Mexican border , the \u2588\u2588\u2588 review shows .\nThis year , 20 percent of pro-Republican ads in congressional races have cited immigration , according to an analysis of broadcast advertising data through Oct. 15 . That \u2019 s up from 8 percent in the same period of the 2014 congressional elections and 5 percent in the 2010 races . The analysis was conducted for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Kantar Media/CMAG , which tracks political ads .\nSpending on Republican ads that mention immigration has more than doubled to $ 62.4 million this year from the 2014 elections and has quadrupled since the 2010 races , the Kantar Media/CMAG data shows . Immigration ad spending has also surged in state-level races . ( Kantar Media/CMAG estimated earlier this month that total political ad spending for broadcast television would rise to $ 2.7 billion this year from $ 2.1 billion in 2014 . )\nIn February , as Braun vied for the party \u2019 s nomination for the Indiana Senate seat , he ran a commercial highlighting a deadly highway crash involving a drunk driver who was in the country illegally . \u201c There are lives at stake , \u201d Braun said in the ad . In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , he said he was not trying to demonize immigrants but was \u201c making a point that border security is important . \u201d\nIn Indiana , only about 5 percent of the state \u2019 s residents are immigrants , compared with 13.6 percent in the United States as a whole . But in the last two months , nearly a third of television ads sponsored or partially sponsored by Braun have mentioned immigration , said Michael Franz , co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project , a nonpartisan group tracking televised political advertising . Trump won Indiana by nearly 20 points in the 2016 election .\nThe attack ad featuring the knife-wielding immigrant was produced by One Nation , a political nonprofit . Spokesman Chris Pack said in a statement that the group works independently of campaigns and \u201c strongly supports the efforts of the President and congressional leadership to reform our broken immigration system . \u201d\nA number of Republican ads link illegal immigrants to crime , but statistics paint a more nuanced picture . While people in the United States illegally have in some instances committed high-profile crimes , multiple studies \u2013 including ones from conservative groups like the Cato Institute - have found that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans .\nNational Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Matt Gorman declined to comment on the overall Republican messaging on immigration , but he did say he sees benefits in opposing so-called sanctuary cities , largely Democratic-run metropolises which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants . Dozens of localities , including New York , Los Angeles and Chicago , have joined the growing \u201c sanctuary \u201d movement .\n\u201c The issue of sanctuary cities is an issue we have used in several ads this cycle . It \u2019 s a potent issue , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s a commonsense thing that many folks are against . \u201d\nTrump won the White House on a promise to crack down on illegal immigrants . He has tried to end a program that gave protection for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children . He has ordered more aggressive enforcement and longer detention . One policy , to separate children from their parents at the southern border , set off an uproar and the president ended the policy in June .\n`` The issue of sanctuary cities is an issue we have used in several ads this cycle . It \u2019 s a potent issue . It \u2019 s a commonsense thing that many folks are against . ''\nTrump \u2019 s administration has also limited legal immigration , imposing more restrictions on work visas and sharply cutting the number of refugees allowed into the United States .\nA thousands-strong group of immigrants now heading north toward the United States from Central America has inflamed the debate over illegal immigration just days before Americans head to the polls . The caravan has riled up Trump , who is intensifying his efforts to frame the Nov. 6 elections around the threat he says illegal immigrants pose to Americans \u2019 safety .\nTrump \u2019 s nationalist tone echoes sentiments rising in parts of Europe since the arrival in 2015 of more than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East , Africa and beyond . Hungary built a border fence along its southern border with Serbia , and anti-immigration politics have roiled Germany \u2019 s parliament .\nThe anti-immigration rhetoric , advertisements and campaign events , combined with the party \u2019 s embrace of Trump \u2019 s immigration crackdown , represent a dramatic evolution of Republicanism under Trump . Anti-immigration themes now dominate a party that for decades was defined by fiscal , social and national security conservatism .\nAs recently as 2013 , when the Senate passed an immigration bill with bipartisan support , a significant portion of the Republican Party backed immigration reform \u2013 including a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million people living in the United States illegally . But those voices have been mostly silenced since the rise of Trump , drowned out by his statements decrying \u201c amnesty for illegals \u201d and \u201c chain migration , \u201d his term for the longstanding U.S. policy that allows legal immigrants to bring family members into the country .\nImmigration is now seen as the top issue for likely Republican voters , especially among those who are older and without a college degree , \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos polling shows . Twenty-three percent of Republicans said this month immigration was the \u201c most important problem \u201d facing the country , up from 4 percent in January 2012 . By contrast , Democrats are far more focused on healthcare , the polls show .\n\u201c Immigration is literally number one - with a bullet - in every survey we do , \u201d said Brandon Moody , a Republican consultant at Axiom Strategies working in the Montana Senate race . Moody says the issue also serves as a kind of shorthand , signaling loyalty to Trump \u2019 s agenda .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos analysis of Twitter data shows that the number of Republican lawmakers tweeting about immigration has risen sharply since Trump \u2019 s election . \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Ipsos searched for immigration-related terms in tweets by Republican federal lawmakers who are seeking re-election in November and have actively tweeted since 2016 .\nAcross 156 official Twitter accounts of Republican lawmakers and tens of thousands of tweets , the analysis identified 1,409 posts in the first nine months of 2018 which included immigration-related terms and phrases such as \u201c immigrant , \u201d \u201c build the wall \u201d or \u201c border. \u201d That \u2019 s a nearly 80 percent increase from 795 posts in the same months of 2017 and more than triple the number from the same period in 2016 .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed every tweet , weeding out those unrelated to immigration or which were entirely critical of Trump and his policies . The messages varied widely , from statements supporting Trump \u2019 s policies to nuanced calls to build a border wall while also reuniting families separated by border authorities .\nThe tweets ranged in tone . Some linked immigrants to threats of violence against Americans , like Texas Representative Randy Weber \u2019 s Jan. 30 tweet : \u201c President says fix the border so gangs can \u2019 t get in & Americans won \u2019 t be murdered . \u201d\nOthers praised Trump \u2019 s get-tough stance . \u201c Illegal incursions way down , rule of law restored , \u201d wrote Rod Blum , a Republican in Iowa facing a difficult re-election . He tweeted about immigration at least 14 times between January and September . \u2588\u2588\u2588 did not find any tweets by Blum on the subject in 2016 and only a handful in 2017 . Blum did not respond to requests for comment .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos polling indicates that Republican lawmakers are largely preaching to the converted : 77 percent of Republican likely voters in a Sept. 8-17 survey said they supported policies to deport more illegal immigrants . An equal number backed building a wall on the southern border .\nAcross the 156 Republican Twitter accounts , \u2588\u2588\u2588 identified only 37 tweets between 2016 and 2018 unambiguously critical of Trump \u2019 s immigration policies - almost all criticizing the separation of families at the border . The critical tweets came from 20 lawmakers who had also posted other tweets supporting strengthening border security or cracking down on illegal immigration .\nSome conservatives , while backing stringent curbs on immigration , say the harsh tone has potentially far-reaching consequences \u2013 adding to political polarization , spawning harsher enforcement and potentially limiting the party \u2019 s appeal to America \u2019 s growing minority population .\n\u201c Trump has remade the Republican Party into a blood and soil national political party that is hostile to immigration , \u201d said Steve Schmidt , a former Republican political consultant . He left the party in June in part because of the policy of separating mothers and children at the southern border . Schmidt said the country \u2019 s growing Hispanic population ultimately will render the immigration issue \u201c a death knell for the Republican Party . \u201d\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement that Trump supports an immigration system based on the merit of the applicants , which \u201c has nothing to do with race . \u201d\n\u201c Trump has remade the Republican Party into a blood and soil national political party that is hostile to immigration .
