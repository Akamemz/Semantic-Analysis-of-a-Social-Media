In September , the Associated Press reported that top aides had decided the president needed a crash course on America \u2019 s role in the world and arranged a 90-minute , map-and-chart heavy lecture at the Pentagon . And amid the hype over Wolff \u2019 s book , MSNBC host Joe Scarborough wrote a column Friday saying that in September 2015 , he confronted Trump over poor debate performances , saying , \u201c Can you read ? \u201d Met with silence , Scarborough pressed again : \u201c I \u2019 m serious , Donald . Do you read ? If someone wrote you a one-page paper on a policy , could you read it ? \u201d Trump replied by brandishing a Bible from his mother and saying he read it all the time\u2014probably a self-aware joke , given Trump \u2019 s proud impiety and displayed ignorance of the Bible .\nThe Scarborough anecdote is the strangest of these . This is not only because Scarborough held on to the story for nearly a year and a half , and continued to hype Trump \u2019 s candidacy on air and advise him privately . ( As James Fallows notes , the real scandal of the Wolff book is that so many people have such grave misgivings about Trump but have kept their heads down . ) It is also unfortunate because Trump is clearly , in strictly literal terms , literate . He displays his basic grasp of the language\u2014if in sloppy , often typo-ridden ways\u2014on Twitter on a roughly daily basis . Such stories , by dint of their hyperbole , offer a bit of a distraction from how serious the problem is .\nMeanwhile , Trump \u2019 s defenders could fall back on semi-plausible excuses , such as arguing that his information consumption was typical of the business world from which he had come . The AP reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis used charts and maps in the briefing on America \u2019 s role because that was \u201c a way the businessman-turned-politician would appreciate . \u201d\nThere was some precedent for this .
