Becerra .\nEvery pregnancy is tough . Pregnancy without sufficient support , financial or emotional , can seem impossible . Every year , pregnancy centers across the United States offer a helping hand to thousands of women so that they can confidently choose life for their babies .\nThese centers provide women personalized attention and care during and after pregnancy , free of charge . Many offer pregnancy tests , ultrasounds , prenatal education and classes on parenting . They also offer tangible support like maternity and baby clothes , diapers and wipes , and even strollers and car seats to lighten the financial burden of caring for a newborn .\nBut the most important service found at a pregnancy center is caring .
