The IAEA has warned its member states that Tehran has embarked on a modernization program of its uranium enrichment facilities that will speed up production of weapons-grade fissile material \u2014 by a factor of five :\nThe U.N. nuclear agency has told member nations that Iran is poised for a major technological upgrade of its uranium enrichment program , in a document seen Thursday by The Associated Press . The move would vastly speed up Tehran \u2019 s ability to make material that can be used for both reactor fuel and nuclear warheads . In an internal note to member nations , the International Atomic Energy Agency said it received notice last week from Iran \u2019 s nuclear agency of plans to install high-technology enriching centrifuges at its main enriching site at Natanz , in central Iran . The machines are estimated to be able to enrich up to five times faster than the present equipment .\nWhat does this mean for the standoff over Iran \u2019 s nuclear program ?
