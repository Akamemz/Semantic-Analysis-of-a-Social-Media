    "content": "House Speaker John Boehner , on the heels of an election that left the balance of power in Washington unchanged , made the first move in crafting the framework for a deal to potentially avert the so-called `` fiscal cliff . ''\nThe speaker , on a phone call with Republicans , said he 'd like a `` bridge '' measure to get negotiators past the looming year-end deadline that would , if left un-addressed , trigger automatic spending cuts and tax hikes , people familiar with the call told Fox News .\nSeparately , Boehner told reporters he wants to then see `` major solutions '' in 2013 `` that begin to solve the problem . ''\nHe said Republicans are willing to accept `` new revenue , '' while indicating that does n't mean higher tax rates . Rather , Boehner said his party is willing to bring in more revenue by closing loopholes and ending certain deductions through comprehensive tax reform -- but only if Democrats are willing to deal , by making serious spending cuts and putting entitlements on the table .\n`` In order to garner Republican support for new revenues , the president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up the entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt . ''\nThe push to craft a short-term bill , though , could end up creating yet another future deadline that lawmakers wait until the eleventh hour to address . Short-term measures have become a go-to solution for a gridlocked Congress -- with the body repeatedly passing budget bills known as `` continuing resolutions '' in lieu of a full-scale budget .\nThe need for renewed fiscal talks grew in urgency after Tuesday 's elections did little to change the dynamic in Washington , with Democrats holding on to the White House and Senate and Republicans keeping control of the House . A deal has so far been held up by a central sticking point -- whether to extend all the Bush-era tax rates , or let them lapse for those making $ 250,000 and up .\nBoth sides have pledged in the aftermath of the election to work together , but for the past two years bipartisan cooperation has been virtually non-existent .\nBoehner , in the Republican House leaders ' call with members , expressed concern about getting major legislation passed in a lame-duck session , making a short-term measure more reasonable until the new Congress is sworn in .\nHowever , he also spoke to the Republicans ' broader agenda in comments to reporters Wednesday afternoon , saying new revenue is on the table as long as it comes through tax loophole reform , not rate hikes .\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor also spoke out Wednesday on Republicans ' goals for the new session , saying in a letter to House Republicans that though the party and the president do n't agree on many issues , it was their duty to come together and work for the American people .\n`` Our task is to legislate based on our principles and forge the compromise that will be necessary to get our nation back on track , '' the letter said .\nHowever , he also said that the GOP would stick to their principles when dealing with the `` fiscal cliff , '' and would push for a fundamental reform of the tax code rather than increasing taxes .\nIn the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that `` we need to start working together , a lot . Gridlock is not the solution .
