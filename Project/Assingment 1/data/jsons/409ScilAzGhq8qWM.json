    "content": "CNN \u2019 s climate crisis town hall on Wednesday night was an unprecedented seven hours of discussion on climate change with 10 of the Democratic 2020 presidential contenders . It was also the most substantive discussion of climate change policies ever broadcast on primetime television .\nEach candidate was given a 40-minute segment , meaning they could provide long , nuanced answers to hard questions on the most far-reaching issue of our time . There was a lot that could have gone wrong , so it \u2019 s remarkable so much went right . The town hall easily outshone the muddled discussion in the paltry half-hour or so devoted to climate change across eight hours of official Democratic debates .\n\u201c Climate is not a separate issue , \u201d said Sen. Cory Booker . \u201c It is the lens through which we must do everything . \u201d\nBefore the town hall , the 2020 candidates put out their comprehensive visions to combat greenhouse gases and adapt to a warming world , but in front of the cameras , they were tested on their mastery of their own material . The questions came from CNN moderators and audience members , and they ranged from carbon taxes to meat consumption to fracking bans .\nFor many observers and climate activists on social media , it was a surprisingly productive discussion that dealt with a core challenge the president must address in office : the exercise of executive power .\nEveryone who said `` what would we possible debate at a # climatedebate ? `` : I hope you 're watching at least a few mins of this marathon # ClimateTownHall . The questions , especially from audience , are ~ALL substantial & important . Far better than almost all asked at debates so far . \u2014 JesseJenkins ( @ JesseJenkins ) September 5 , 2019\nBetween segments , CNN provided updates on Hurricane Dorian , the strongest storm of the year . It served as a vivid backdrop for how the effects of warming like rising sea levels and intense rainfall are worsening the harm from extreme weather .\nThroughout the night , candidates were forced past simply reciting vague platitudes , dunking on President Trump , and sniping at their opponents . Instead , facing an audience with real stakes in the fight against climate change , they had to defend their ideas on their merits .\nSome did so better than others . And across seven hours of questioning , we learned about who stands most ready to lead the charge against climate change but also who is driving the discussion .\nHere are those who reached high ground and those who were underwater at the end of the long evening .\nWashington Gov . Jay Inslee built his presidential campaign around the urgency of combating climate change . Although he wasn \u2019 t onstage Wednesday night \u2014 he dropped out of the race in August after putting out more than 200 pages of climate change policy , all of it ambitious and detailed \u2014 his influence was everywhere .\nInslee sat down with Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) in Seattle last week as she was crafting her climate plan . He chatted with former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke , former Vice President Joe Biden , and Sens . Bernie Sanders , Cory Booker , and Amy Klobuchar . Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has been \u201c looking for me , \u201d Inslee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Wednesday , but they haven \u2019 t been able to connect yet .\nOn Wednesday night , several candidates deemed Inslee \u2019 s platform the gold standard of climate plans . \u201c I also want to give a shoutout to governor Jay Inslee who did a fantastic job of bringing this issue to the forefront of this campaign , \u201d Castro said .\nKlobuchar said she supported the \u201c individual efforts like [ the ones ] Governor Inslee talks about so well \u2014 things like even using cold water for the clothes saves five times the energy . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to steal a line from Governor Inslee , \u201d Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) said . \u201c Donald Trump said wind turbines cause cancer . And Jay said , no , they don \u2019 t cause cancer ; they cause jobs . \u201d\nWarren explained her recently unveiled a proposal that adopted one plank of Inslee \u2019 s six-plan platform , calling to decarbonize electricity , vehicles , and buildings through higher regulatory standards . Warren \u2019 s campaign told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they are continuing to look at the rest of Inslee \u2019 s climate agenda .\nAhead of the climate town hall , Inslee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he would be watching for how candidates talked about the timelines of their plans and how they would get them passed through slim majorities in Congress ( he supports getting rid of the filibuster ) . Few candidates \u2014 except Sanders , whose Green New Deal proposes $ 16 trillion in federal investments \u2014 have put forward proposals as comprehensive and as big as Inslee \u2019 s . But Inslee is still encouraged that people are listening to him .\n\u201c I \u2019 m honored people have recognized our plan has real substance , \u201d Inslee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u2014Tara Golshan\nThe tenacious activists of the Sunrise Movement , the youth-led political movement that helped develop the Green New Deal , campaigned for a presidential debate on climate change .\nWhile the DNC voted down holding an official climate debate , Sunrise activists secured support for the idea from a majority of the Democratic presidential candidates , building the case for CNN ( and MSNBC , which is hosting a town hall September 19 and 20 ) to take a chance on holding a climate change forum .\n\u201c You and other members of the Sunrise Movement are going to be the ones who are going to receive the credit for this change that we \u2019 re talking about today , \u201d former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke told Juliana Rossi de Camargo , an organizer at Sunrise , during the CNN town hall .\nomg it 's just hitting me that @ sunrisemvmt did this . the coalition they built made this happen . i 'm gon na cry . i 'm so so so proud of you and all your sweet smart climate babies @ VarshPrakash @ evanlweber @ DJaye @ erin_bridges_94 \u2014 Rhiana Gunn-Wright ( @ rgunns ) September 5 , 2019\nSunrise is also helping set the goalposts for the candidates \u2019 climate policy ambition . Every candidate \u2019 s agenda was tacitly or overtly measured against Sunrise \u2019 s foundational climate proposal , the Green New Deal , a framework of principles for eliminating the United States \u2019 contribution to climate change by the middle of the century .\n\u201c I love the vision of the Green New Deal , \u201d said entrepreneur Andrew Yang . \u201c The framers of it have done us all a great service by energizing so many people around a vision . \u201d\nAnd the Sunrise activists themselves , a cadre of vocal young and diverse campaigners , are continuing to push the candidates to strive for more ambitious emissions reduction targets , demanding details and commitment from everyone seeking office . \u2014Umair Irfan\nSanders was somewhat late to the game in this climate primary ; he didn \u2019 t release his comprehensive climate plan until August . But when he came out , he came out with a bang , outlining the only plan so far that rivals Inslee \u2019 s in scope and ambition . And it contained a few provisions that no other campaign has touched , most notably a plan to semi-nationalize the nation \u2019 s electric utilities . The price tag : $ 16 trillion over 10 years .\nAt the forum , Sanders benefited from following Biden , who was as rambling and unfocused as he has been this whole campaign season . By contrast , Sanders was sharp and on-message , with easy command over the details of his plan . And the more intimate setting allowed Sanders moments of quiet reflection and \u2014 especially in response to a question about fossil fuel workers \u2014 real emotion .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve spent my entire life fighting for workers , \u201d he said . \u201c Let me be clear : The coal miners in this country , the men and women who work on the oil rigs , they are not my enemy . My enemy is climate change . \u201d\nSubstantively , his worst answer was his first . He was asked about the filibuster and offered a limp defense , claiming he doesn \u2019 t want \u201c the Senate to become the House. \u201d He claimed that , instead , he could pass his climate plan through a majority process in the Senate called budget reconciliation . ( That \u2019 s not true \u2014 only a limited slice of any climate plan could pass reconciliation rules . )\nNot many voters will care about the filibuster , though , and from there , Sanders went on to press his case against fossil fuel companies ( he would direct his Justice Department to hold them criminally liable ) , vow to protect workers and small businesses , and , almost alone among candidates , face up squarely to the idea that there might be some effort and sacrifice involved in solving the climate crisis . \u201c There \u2019 s going to be change , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re going to have to ask people to understand that we have got to make those changes now , even though they may be a little bit uncomfortable , for the sake of future generations . \u201d\nOne notable dynamic : With Jay Inslee out of the race , Sanders \u2019 s plan has become the de facto marker of ambition . Several candidates were asked to compare their plans to his ; he loomed over the debate even when he wasn \u2019 t onstage . \u2014David Roberts\nA mother who lost her daughter to Superstorm Sandy . A nurse concerned about climate impacts on her low-income patients . A refugee from rising sea levels . A union worker anxious about losing his job .\nThe most compelling questions of the night came from ordinary people who have faced the consequences of climate change or might suffer from the efforts to combat it . Their personal narratives added tangible stakes to the often-abstract discussions about climate policy . And looking straight at the candidates , they leveled tough , specific questions that were difficult to dodge .\n\u201c My husband and I own our one and only 2,000-square-foot house , which is in the 500-year floodplain , \u201d said retired middle school teacher Emily Wilkins to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro . \u201c We are required to carry FEMA flood insurance , but it rises in cost 18 percent every year . We may lose our house at some point when we can no longer afford the insurance . What proposals of yours would help us stay in our home ? \u201d\nDisability and LGBTQ rights activist Carson Tueller pressed Sen. Kamala Harris on how she would address the impacts of climate change on marginalized people , drawing on his personal struggles during this summer \u2019 s heat wave . \u201c I have a spinal cord injury , and part of having a spinal cord injury means I experience something called thermodysregulation . I can \u2019 t regulate my body temperature . I can \u2019 t sweat . July of 2019 was our Earth \u2019 s hottest month on record , \u201d he said . \u201c And I had my health put at risk seriously more than once . \u201d\nThe questioners elicited good answers and pushed some candidates into awkward positions , as good questions should . And for viewers at home , they helped illustrate how efforts to mitigate climate change might affect them and who in the race for president would be their best advocate in the transition toward clean energy . \u2014Umair Irfan\nThis is why , though the ratings won \u2019 t match a debate , the town halls are better for climate activists . Instead of \u201c show of hands : Ban hamburgers ? \u201d you get openings for longer answers https : //t.co/V3qB7lPJB0 \u2014 Dave Weigel ( @ daveweigel ) September 5 , 2019\nLet \u2019 s face it , the first two CNN moderators , Wolf Blitzer and Erin Burnett , were ... not good . Blitzer \u2019 s idea of a tough question was to push Andrew Yang on whether \u201c all Americans are going to have to drive electric cars . \u201d\n\u201c Electric cars , it \u2019 s not something you have to do , \u201d Yang said , laughing . \u201c It \u2019 s awesome ! \u201d\nBlitzer : \u201c So what \u2019 s the answer ? Are we all going to have to drive electric cars ? \u201d\nYang : \u201c We are all going to love driving our electric cars . \u201d\nThis is the typical cable moderator \u2019 s idea of a tough question : asking Democrats to respond to a Republican talking point . There was a stark contrast between the moderators \u2019 goofy gotcha questions and the articulate , informed questions from the audience .\nHowever , Anderson Cooper turned it around when he took over , offering helpful context and clarification for both questioners and candidates . ( \u201c Thanks for your help , \u201d Biden cracked at one point . ) And special \u201c climate correspondent \u201d Bill Weir was around all night , asking smart questions , keeping the focus on ongoing human suffering .\nTaking a step back , it \u2019 s remarkable this thing happened at all , and it easily could have been filled with shallow questions and clich\u00e9d answers . Instead , CNN managed to host seven hours of sustained , substantive , primetime discussion on climate change \u2014 something that would have been unthinkable even six months ago \u2014 with very little fat on it .\nFor as often as the network is criticized for its climate coverage , it deserves enormous credit for this . \u2014David Roberts\nIt is difficult to imagine any set of Republican lawmakers engaging in sustained , positive policy discussion for seven hours , but the Democratic candidates pulled it off with aplomb . They did not attack one another ; they spent very little time attacking Republicans ; even Trump himself only got a few callouts . Almost the entire event was devoted to forward-looking social and policy discussion . It was downright inspiring .\nThere are plenty of differences among the candidates , on climate change and other issues . And not every candidate hit it out of the park at the town hall . ( Harris and Biden , in particular , seemed ill at ease and did more filibustering than the others . ) But not a single candidate came unprepared ; not a single candidate was anything less than informed and engaged . A few of them \u2014 Yang and Booker in particular \u2014 turned in some of the strongest performances of their races so far .\nThe primary season may well be miserable and Trump may well win in 2020 , but Democrats \u2014 especially Democrats concerned about climate change \u2014 should take some solace in the fact that they boast a deep and impressive bench , aligned on the right side of history . \u2014David Roberts\nJoe Biden \u2019 s big moment at the CNN town hall was not one he was hoping for : He was called out for planning to attend a Thursday campaign fundraiser co-hosted by Andrew Goldman , who helped found the natural gas company Western LNG .\nAlthough Goldman isn \u2019 t technically a fossil fuel executive and isn \u2019 t part of day-to-day operations at the company , Biden said he \u2019 d consider pulling out of the fundraiser if there was more of a link between the two . But even a whiff of coziness between Biden and someone with ties to a fossil fuel company won \u2019 t make climate activists happy . ( Immediately after the debate , Sunrise called on Biden to cancel the fundraiser . )\nCompared to Warren and Sanders , the former vice president and current Democratic frontrunner didn \u2019 t offer a clear vision on climate . Biden gave long and often rambling answers about his climate plan , noting that climate groups gave it a \u201c B+ or beyond. \u201d He declined to join some of his opponents in supporting a nationwide ban on fracking . And he kept returning to the point that his experience talking to world leaders as Obama \u2019 s vice president would help him build an international climate coalition . In doing so , Biden seemed to suggest that whatever the US did to decarbonize ultimately wouldn \u2019 t matter if the rest of the world didn \u2019 t follow the lead .\n\u201c The fact of the matter is that we make up 15 percent of the problem . The rest of the world makes up 80 , 85 percent of the problem , \u201d Biden said . \u201c If we did everything perfectly \u2014 and we must and should in order to get other countries to move \u2014 we still have to get the rest of the world to come along and the fact of the matter is we have to up the ante considerably. \u201d \u2014Ella Nilsen\nThe CNN climate town hall once again showed just how much the Overton window has moved for Democrats on climate change . President Obama openly boasted about increasing US fossil fuel production , fossil fuel exports , and low gasoline prices . Climate change barely came up at all in the 2016 presidential race .\nNow Democrats are describing all kinds of ways they will hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its pollution and emissions , and they are charting the course for weaning America off its products .\nAll 10 candidates want to restrict drilling on public lands . Sen. Bernie Sanders wants criminal prosecution of climate polluters . Harris wants to sue them . \u201c They are causing harm and death in communities , \u201d she said . \u201c And there has been no accountability. \u201d Booker and Sanders so far have said they would ban fracking .\nCastro described the inevitable end of natural gas : \u201c Almost a decade ago , we had been saying that natural gas was a bridge fuel . We \u2019 re coming to the end of the bridge . My plan calls for moving toward clean , renewable , zero-emission energy in the years to come \u201d\nSubsidies to oil and gas companies , which all the candidates oppose , also came up ; Sanders wants to end them entirely by 2050 . \u201c What goes on right now is we are giving the fossil fuel industry approximately $ 400 billion every single year in subsidies and tax breaks , \u201d Sanders said .\nYang and Warren highlighted just how the industry has distracted and manipulated the public on climate change ; Yang described how he intends to reduce the industry \u2019 s influence in politics . \u201c You know how they \u2019 ve been spending some of their money , their billions of dollars in profit ? \u201d he said . \u201c On a misinformation campaign to the American people , and they \u2019 ve taken our legislature hostage . They have the fossil fuel lobbying industry that \u2019 s in the tens of millions a year . \u201d\nThe candidates differ in their timelines for transitioning off fossil fuels , but the forum made it clear just how unified they are in their commitment to policy that will radically restrict and curtail this industry come 2020 . \u2014Eliza Barclay\nSeveral candidates had to contend with variations from the audience on one of the trickiest climate questions : How will you encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption , given the disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions of beef production compared to other foods ?\nWhat emerged was a range of ideas including using nutrition labels to educate Americans on the environmental impacts of meat production , using a carbon tax to signal the emissions impacts of meat , and restricting subsidies to the meat industry \u2014 all of which could potentially hurt the meat industry and benefit the climate .\nModerator Erin Burnett asked Harris if she supports changing the dietary guidelines to reduce red meat . \u201c We will encourage moderation , \u201d Harris said . \u201c I \u2019 ve always believed that we should expand what is on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store . We should expand the list . Included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment . \u201d\nSeveral candidates also used the diet question as an opportunity to point out that Republicans have made the hypothetical threat of Democrats taking away Americans \u2019 hamburgers an argument against the Green New Deal . \u201c The important thing to understand is that we can have a more balanced diet and therefore a more balanced footprint and not abolish the cow , \u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg said . \u201c [ Abolishing the cow ] is what people are saying about the Green New Deal . Because it \u2019 s an easy Republican talking point . \u201d\nButtigieg noted that his carbon tax applied to meat would help curb meat consumption by demonstrating to consumers the climate costs of meat production . \u201c We change the economic signal and bring it into balance , and balance is what we have lost when it comes to our relationship with creation , with the Earth , that sustains our ability to live , \u201d he said .\nBooker , who is vegan , suggested that his administration would also rein in subsidies to the meat and dairy industry . \u201c We are going to have to make sure our government is not subsidizing the things that make us sick and unhealthy and hurt our environment and start to incentivize the practices that get farming and get agriculture and get the health of our communities back. \u201d \u2014Eliza Barclay\nWe watched seven straight hours of Democrats discussing climate policy so you wouldn \u2019 t have to .\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle ?

(That\u2019s not true \u2014 only a limited slice of any climate plan could pass reconciliation rules.)\n\nNot many voters will care about the filibuster, though, and from there, Sanders went on to press his case against fossil fuel companies (he would direct his Justice Department to hold them criminally liable), vow to protect workers and small businesses, and, almost alone among candidates, face up squarely to the idea that there might be some effort and sacrifice involved in solving the climate crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to ask people to understand that we have got to make those changes now, even though they may be a little bit uncomfortable, for the sake of future generations.\u201d\n\nOne notable dynamic: With Jay Inslee out of the race, Sanders\u2019s plan has become the de facto marker of ambition.

And looking straight at the candidates, they leveled tough, specific questions that were difficult to dodge.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I own our one and only 2,000-square-foot house, which is in the 500-year floodplain,\u201d said retired middle school teacher Emily Wilkins to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. \u201cWe are required to carry FEMA flood insurance, but it rises in cost 18 percent every year. We may lose our house at some point when we can no longer afford the insurance. What proposals of yours would help us stay in our home?\u201d\n\nDisability and LGBTQ rights activist Carson Tueller pressed Sen. Kamala Harris on how she would address the impacts of climate change on marginalized people, drawing on his personal struggles during this summer\u2019s heat wave. \u201cI have a spinal cord injury, and part of having a spinal cord injury means I experience something called thermodysregulation. I can\u2019t regulate my body temperature. I can\u2019t sweat. July of 2019 was our Earth\u2019s hottest month on record,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I had my health put at risk seriously more than once.\u201d\n\nThe questioners elicited good answers and pushed some candidates into awkward positions, as good questions should. And for viewers at home, they helped illustrate how efforts to mitigate climate change might affect them and who in the race for president would be their best advocate in the transition toward clean energy. \u2014Umair Irfan\n\nThis is why, though the ratings won\u2019t match a debate, the town halls are better for climate activists. Instead of \u201cshow of hands: Ban hamburgers?\u201d you get openings for longer answers https://t.co/V3qB7lPJB0 \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 5, 2019\n\nWinner: CNN\n\nLet\u2019s face it, the first two CNN moderators, Wolf Blitzer and Erin Burnett, were ... not good. Blitzer\u2019s idea of a tough question was to push Andrew Yang on whether \u201call Americans are going to have to drive electric cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric cars, it\u2019s not something you have to do,\u201d Yang said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d\n\nBlitzer: \u201cSo what\u2019s the answer? Are we all going to have to drive electric cars?\u201d\n\nYang: \u201cWe are all going to love driving our electric cars.\u201d\n\nBlitzer: \u201cWill we have to drive electric cars?\u201d\n\nOy.\n\nThis is the typical cable moderator\u2019s idea of a tough question: asking Democrats to respond to a Republican talking point. There was a stark contrast between the moderators\u2019 goofy gotcha questions and the articulate, informed questions from the audience.\n\nHowever, Anderson Cooper turned it around when he took over, offering helpful context and clarification for both questioners and candidates. (\u201cThanks for your help,\u201d Biden cracked at one point.) And special \u201cclimate correspondent\u201d Bill Weir was around all night, asking smart questions, keeping the focus on ongoing human suffering.\n\nTaking a step back, it\u2019s remarkable this thing happened at all, and it easily could have been filled with shallow questions and clich\u00e9d answers. Instead, CNN managed to host seven hours of sustained, substantive, primetime discussion on climate change \u2014 something that would have been unthinkable even six months ago \u2014 with very little fat on it.\n\nFor as often as the network is criticized for its climate coverage, it deserves enormous credit for this. \u2014David Roberts\n\nWinner: the Democratic Party\n\nIt is difficult to imagine any set of Republican lawmakers engaging in sustained, positive policy discussion for seven hours, but the Democratic candidates pulled it off with aplomb. They did not attack one another; they spent very little time attacking Republicans; even Trump himself only got a few callouts. Almost the entire event was devoted to forward-looking social and policy discussion. It was downright inspiring.\n\nThere are plenty of differences among the candidates, on climate change and other issues. And not every candidate hit it out of the park at the town hall. (Harris and Biden, in particular, seemed ill at ease and did more filibustering than the others.) But not a single candidate came unprepared; not a single candidate was anything less than informed and engaged. A few of them \u2014 Yang and Booker in particular \u2014 turned in some of the strongest performances of their races so far.\n\nThe primary season may well be miserable and Trump may well win in 2020, but Democrats \u2014 especially Democrats concerned about climate change \u2014 should take some solace in the fact that they boast a deep and impressive bench, aligned on the right side of history. \u2014David Roberts\n\nLoser: Joe Biden\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s big moment at the CNN town hall was not one he was hoping for: He was called out for planning to attend a Thursday campaign fundraiser co-hosted by Andrew Goldman, who helped found the natural gas company Western LNG.\n\nAlthough Goldman isn\u2019t technically a fossil fuel executive and isn\u2019t part of day-to-day operations at the company, Biden said he\u2019d consider pulling out of the fundraiser if there was more of a link between the two. But even a whiff of coziness between Biden and someone with ties to a fossil fuel company won\u2019t make climate activists happy. (Immediately after the debate, Sunrise called on Biden to cancel the fundraiser.)\n\nCompared to Warren and Sanders, the former vice president and current Democratic frontrunner didn\u2019t offer a clear vision on climate. Biden gave long and often rambling answers about his climate plan, noting that climate groups gave it a \u201cB+ or beyond.\u201d He declined to join some of his opponents in supporting a nationwide ban on fracking. And he kept returning to the point that his experience talking to world leaders as Obama\u2019s vice president would help him build an international climate coalition. In doing so, Biden seemed to suggest that whatever the US did to decarbonize ultimately wouldn\u2019t matter if the rest of the world didn\u2019t follow the lead.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that we make up 15 percent of the problem. The rest of the world makes up 80, 85 percent of the problem,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we did everything perfectly \u2014 and we must and should in order to get other countries to move \u2014 we still have to get the rest of the world to come along and the fact of the matter is we have to up the ante considerably.\u201d \u2014Ella Nilsen\n\nLoser: oil and gas companies\n\nThe CNN climate town hall once again showed just how much the Overton window has moved for Democrats on climate change. President Obama openly boasted about increasing US fossil fuel production, fossil fuel exports, and low gasoline prices. Climate change barely came up at all in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nNow Democrats are describing all kinds of ways they will hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its pollution and emissions, and they are charting the course for weaning America off its products.\n\nAll 10 candidates want to restrict drilling on public lands. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants criminal prosecution of climate polluters. Harris wants to sue them. \u201cThey are causing harm and death in communities,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there has been no accountability.\u201d Booker and Sanders so far have said they would ban fracking.\n\nCastro described the inevitable end of natural gas: \u201cAlmost a decade ago, we had been saying that natural gas was a bridge fuel. We\u2019re coming to the end of the bridge. My plan calls for moving toward clean, renewable, zero-emission energy in the years to come\u201d\n\nSubsidies to oil and gas companies, which all the candidates oppose, also came up; Sanders wants to end them entirely by 2050. \u201cWhat goes on right now is we are giving the fossil fuel industry approximately $400 billion every single year in subsidies and tax breaks,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nYang and Warren highlighted just how the industry has distracted and manipulated the public on climate change; Yang described how he intends to reduce the industry\u2019s influence in politics. \u201cYou know how they\u2019ve been spending some of their money, their billions of dollars in profit?\u201d he said. \u201cOn a misinformation campaign to the American people, and they\u2019ve taken our legislature hostage. They have the fossil fuel lobbying industry that\u2019s in the tens of millions a year.\u201d\n\nThe candidates differ in their timelines for transitioning off fossil fuels, but the forum made it clear just how unified they are in their commitment to policy that will radically restrict and curtail this industry come 2020. \u2014Eliza Barclay\n\nLoser: meat\n\nSeveral candidates had to contend with variations from the audience on one of the trickiest climate questions: How will you encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption, given the disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions of beef production compared to other foods?\n\nWhat emerged was a range of ideas including using nutrition labels to educate Americans on the environmental impacts of meat production, using a carbon tax to signal the emissions impacts of meat, and restricting subsidies to the meat industry \u2014 all of which could potentially hurt the meat industry and benefit the climate.\n\nModerator Erin Burnett asked Harris if she supports changing the dietary guidelines to reduce red meat. \u201cWe will encourage moderation,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that we should expand what is on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store. We should expand the list. Included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nSeveral candidates also used the diet question as an opportunity to point out that Republicans have made the hypothetical threat of Democrats taking away Americans\u2019 hamburgers an argument against the Green New Deal. \u201cThe important thing to understand is that we can have a more balanced diet and therefore a more balanced footprint and not abolish the cow,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. \u201c[Abolishing the cow] is what people are saying about the Green New Deal. Because it\u2019s an easy Republican talking point.\u201d\n\nButtigieg noted that his carbon tax applied to meat would help curb meat consumption by demonstrating to consumers the climate costs of meat production. \u201cWe change the economic signal and bring it into balance, and balance is what we have lost when it comes to our relationship with creation, with the Earth, that sustains our ability to live,\u201d he said.\n\nBooker, who is vegan, suggested that his administration would also rein in subsidies to the meat and dairy industry. \u201cWe are going to have to make sure our government is not subsidizing the things that make us sick and unhealthy and hurt our environment and start to incentivize the practices that get farming and get agriculture and get the health of our communities back.\u201d \u2014Eliza Barclay\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nWe watched seven straight hours of Democrats discussing climate policy so you wouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?
