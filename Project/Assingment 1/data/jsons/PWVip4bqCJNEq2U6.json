Most stark in the results was the party 's disconnect from white working-class voters .\nThe primary exposed the deep divide between the progressive and centrist wings of the party , which clearly have not healed . And strategists learned the hard way just how difficult it is to replicate the Obama coalition without the President at the top of the ticket .\nAs they sift through the results , most baffling to some Democrats was how some voters who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 ended up backing Trump .\nAs Clinton retreated to private life in Chappaqua , New York , and the President prepares to leave office , it was clear that there was no consensus about who should lead the party , or even lead the discussion about where the party needs to go after Tuesday .\nElizabeth Warren , Bernie Sanders , Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will play leading roles . But there are broad policy disagreements among them , as well as competing objectives . Schumer , for example , must keep his eye on the 2018 races when he will have slew of Democrats up for re-election in conservative states .\nClinton 's unexpected losses in industrial states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- as well as the razor-edge race in Michigan , which CNN has not called \u2014 underscored the view of Democratic strategists who privately complained throughout 2016 that Clinton had n't found a message that connected with working-class Americans .\nThough polls showed many Latinos and women were repelled by Trump before Election Day , Trump actually slightly outperformed Mitt Romney among Latinos . And Clinton drew a slightly smaller share of women to the polls than Obama did in 2012 , according to exit polls .\nShe won the lowest share of union households of any Democrat since 1980 -- notching 51 % of union households to Trump 's 43 % , according to exit polls . By comparison , Obama won 59 % of union households in 2008 .\nTrump 's campaign was vacuous . Many of his policy proposals were unachievable , even in the eyes of his supporters . Yet his populist message struck a chord with voters across the ideological spectrum .\n`` Clearly what this election demonstrated -- from the primaries through the general election -- was that the centrist , more moderate wing of the ( Democratic ) party has no standing with working class and middle class voters in this country , '' said Jeff Weaver , who was campaign manager for Clinton 's Democratic rival , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders .\n`` It 's time for the progressive wing to reassert themselves and offer a bold agenda to the American people , '' Weaver said . `` The real losers in this campaign were the Democratic and Republican establishments . People clearly wanted change . Trump became the vehicle for that change in the general election . I think many people voted for him in spite of his outrageous positions , as opposed to in favor of them . So we need to demonstrate to people that we stand with them , not with the wealthy and powerful . ''\nThough Clinton was raised in a middle-class household familiar with economic struggles , she never managed to find a message that connected with struggling working class families . That was particularly ironic considering she ran against a billionaire who lives in the penthouse of a gold plated tower .\nLong before Trump was viewed as a real contender , Bill Burton , a former adviser to Obama , recalled discussing the message challenges facing Democrats in 2016 as far as two years ago .\nHe argued then that no one would be able to recreate the Obama coalition , because Obama was simply a uniquely talented candidate and `` special guy . '' Democrats already knew at that time , he said , that they had a problem with middle-class white voters `` that we 're not paying attention to . '' He believed that if the party did n't fix that , they could n't win .\n`` And that 's what happened , '' Burton said in an interview Thursday . `` We could n't win a race where we did n't have enough white voters to make up for the gaps in the Obama coalition . There 's any number of reasons for that -- from ( FBI Director ) James Comey to Donald Trump having a message that appealed in middle America . ''\n`` There 's going to be a lot of soul searching , and there 's no one answer for it -- anyone who suggests that there is , is just wrong , '' he said . `` In 2020 , we 've got to be thinking about a coalition of voters that builds on the Obama coalition to the best that we can , but also reaches out to a big group of voters in the middle of the country who feel like they 've been left behind . ''\nThe conversation about how to do that will unfold over many months , after operatives and activists have time to digest the data and missteps from this campaign .\nOne early proxy for the internal struggles of the party will be the election of the party 's chair next year .\nOn Thursday , Sanders said he would back Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota as the next chair of the Democratic National Committee and attributed Tuesday 's losses to a lack of enthusiasm .\nFormer DNC Chairman Howard Dean pointed to what he views as party infrastructure problems Thursday , as he also threw his hat into the ring for party chair .\n`` The Dems need organization and focus on the young , '' Dean tweeted . `` Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab . I am in for chairman again . ''\nDonna Brazile is currently serving as the party 's interim chair through March 2017 after stepping in replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz in July when Wikileaks released emails showing that Democratic officials tried to help Clinton clinch the nomination , instead of playing the role of neutral arbiter in determining the nominee .\nDemocratic strategist and CNN commentator Hilary Rosen noted that the margins in battleground states where Clinton lost were relatively close , making the discussion about what to do even more complex .\nMany Democrats were stunned by the fact that Clinton and Trump were separated by only about a percentage point in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014and the race in Michigan still looks even closer than that .\nSanders supporters noted it was hard to imagine him losing states like that in the Industrial Midwest .
