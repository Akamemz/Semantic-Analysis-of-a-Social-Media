    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) In the next presidential election , Republican leaders are hoping to win among young voters -- something they have n't done since 1988 , before many of today 's young voters were born .\nBut winning over the current crop of young adults -- millennials -- wo n't be easy . They are more liberal than their parents , even when they identify as Republican . They rely heavily on social media , to which the GOP has been slow to adapt . And although several Republican candidates and the party itself are trying to appeal to them , some of the youngest party members say they simply are n't feeling the love .\n`` Personally , national party leaders have been relatively non-existent in response to our generation , '' said Alexander Staudt , 21 , a University of Iowa senior and president of Students for Rand Paul . `` This is one thing that disappoints me , that our age group has effectively been disenfranchised due the general lack of motivation by party leaders to drive the youth to vote . ''\nTraditionally , young adults vote in smaller percentages than their elders . But in a tight election , their vote can make a difference . In 2012 , 60 % of voters under 30 voted for President Barack Obama , giving him the edge he needed to defeat Republican Mitt Romney .\nThat explains why , this time around , the Republican Party and many GOP candidates are working harder to appeal to young voters . The Republican National Committee has posted on its website profiles of young adult campaign workers , or `` GOP Millennials , '' photos of young people attending debate parties and registering voters and a link for college students to become `` Campus Captains '' to educate their classmates on Republican candidates .\nIndividual candidates and their supporters also are working to attract millennials , the generation born after 1980 . Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky launched an 11-campus college tour to connect with students . The campaign of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has a group called Students for Carson , which regularly hosts debate parties at college campuses . Businesswoman Carly Fiorina appeared in a well-received video on BuzzFeed , a news site popular with younger voters . And a student at Claremont McKenna College in California started the Millennials Rising PAC , a super PAC that supports former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush .\nA number of Republican candidates are taking steps to reach millennials through social media , said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg , director of the Tufts University Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning & Engagement ( CIRCLE ) , which studies young people 's political engagement .\nCarson has aggressively engaged social media and has more Facebook fans -- upwards of 4.87 million -- than any other candidate . Fiorina and Trump have hosted live chats on Periscope , an app popular with millennials . And arguably , no candidate 's Twitter account is more active than Donald Trump 's .\nMatt Moore , a millennial who is chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party , crowed about the latest GOP outreach efforts .\n`` The RNC 's leaders , especially Reince Priebus , really get it . That 's why you are seeing such innovative ideas on connecting with young voters , '' said Moore , 33 , one of the youngest members of the Republican National Committee . `` The RNC has opened an office in Silicon Valley not only to attract the best and brightest tech minds to the political arena , but to show our commitment to the innovation economy . ''\nNevertheless , Republicans face a number of challenges . Millennials are more liberal than any other age group , and even those who are Republican or who grew up in conservative households consider themselves more progressive than their parents , particularly on social issues , according to the Pew Research Center . Young conservatives are more likely than their older counterparts to support gay rights , immigrants and environmental regulations , positions more closely aligned with the Democratic Party .\nSome millennial Republicans say they have trouble getting the party elders to hear them . Lilia Dashevsky , 18 , a former chair of the Arizona Teenage Republicans , said helping the old guard understand their progressive positions on social issues is a major challenge for younger conservatives .\n`` Many people are hesitant to listen to us or even give second thought to our opinions and beliefs because they are different from the Republican 'norm , ' '' she said .\n`` We should be the open-tent party ; it is extremely attractive for young people to feel included and accepted , '' Dashevsky added . `` We are all about social inclusion and listening to opposing ideas while formulating our own thoughts based on our personal experiences . ''\nThat vision of an open-tent party has taken a beating during a year in which various Republican candidates have advocated building a wall to keep out immigrants , deporting undocumented immigrants and preventing Syrian refugees from settling in the U.S .\nPerhaps there is one issue that best illustrates the challenges Republicans face in winning over millennials : More than 60 % of young Republicans support same-sex marriage , Pew reported .\nCandidates ' positions aside , Republicans start out at a numerical disadvantage among young voters . Millennials are the most Democratic of any generation , Pew found . Slightly more than half ( 51 % ) of them identify as Democrats or lean Democratic , while just 35 % are or lean Republican .\n`` President Obama won two terms due to his overwhelming success among young and minority voters , '' said Moore , the South Carolina Republican chair . `` In 2016 and beyond , our party faces a demographic tidal wave unless we get ahead of it . ''\nDespite the obstacles , the candidates see some openings . For instance , like Republicans in general , many millennials are economic conservatives . In fact , this generation is the most fiscally conservative since the Great Depression , preferring to save rather than invest their money , according to a study by UBS Wealth Management Americas .\n`` Students are graduating from college with very bleak job prospects and , in most cases , very high debt , '' said Garrison Coward , the 25-year-old political director for Rep . Rob Wittman ( R-Virginia ) . `` We are running the risk of being the first generation that may not do better than our parents ' generation . ''\nSen. Marco Rubio , of Florida , is responding to that sentiment both in his language -- he talks a lot about creating a `` New American Century '' -- and in his policy proposals . He is proposing to reduce student debt by establishing repayment plans that are based on income . He also promotes the `` sharing economy '' -- businesses such as Uber and AirBnB that are popular with millennials because they offer peer-to-peer exchanges as a fiscally conservative alternative to the traditional way of doing things .\n`` Marco 's message about a New American Century obviously speaks directly to the hopes and dreams of young Americans , '' said Rubio 's communications director , Alex Conant . `` The entire purpose of our campaign is to ensure that future generations of Americans have the same opportunities to achieve the American Dream that our parents and grandparents did . ''\nIn addition , many of the millennials who say they `` lean Democratic '' actually are independent voters .\n`` Most millennials are not familiar with party structures ; they just want to be involved , '' Coward said . `` So it is important for us to find non-conventional ways to get millennials involved in the sometimes mundane party processes , especially on the state levels . ''\nTherein lies another problem . Across the partisan divide is a candidate who is something of a superstar among the young adult crowd . And even if he does n't win the Democratic nomination , Sen. Bernie Sanders has tapped into a passion among millennials that could accrue to the party 's ultimate nominee .\nSanders , a septuagenarian who represents Vermont , has addressed large crowds on college campuses as he rails against income inequality , advocates free tuition at public colleges and universities and argues that the government should reduce the burden of student loans . He also has met with millennials who are pushing for criminal justice reform .\n`` Our campaign attracts millennials because we 've put forth an aggressive agenda that speaks to the real and pressing needs of young people : Make college affordable , create jobs to reduce high youth unemployment and fight climate change for future generations , '' said Kenneth Pennington , Sanders ' digital director .\n`` It does n't take much to sell Bernie 's agenda to young voters . We just need to get it in front of more people . ''\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is working to reach millennials through an aggressive use of social media , by appearing on late-night talk shows and rolling out more than 100 Students for Hillary chapters across the country , said Xochitl Hinojosa , a campaign spokeswoman .\n`` The campaign has made it a priority to engage millennials through policy positions like marriage equality , college affordability and addressing student debt , climate change and providing people with economic opportunity , including increasing wages , '' she said .\nIn the end , it will be up to the candidates to show millennials they care about them and about the issues that most concern young adults , said Kristen Soltis Anderson , author of The Selfie Vote : Where Millennials Are Leading America ( And How Republicans Can Keep Up ) .\n`` Ultimately , the GOP 's success with millennials will come down to the nominee and the extent to which he or she makes millennials a priority , '' she said . `` I believe most Republicans now understand that they ca n't lose young voters by 20-plus points and still expect to win the White House , but it remains to be seen if they will do what it takes to win them back .
