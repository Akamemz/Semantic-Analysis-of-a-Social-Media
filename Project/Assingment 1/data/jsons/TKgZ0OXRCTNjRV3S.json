    "content": "President Donald Trump and two of his top public health advisers have taken different stances on the issue of when \u2014 and how \u2014 the decision to ease social distancing will be made .\nTrump has advocated for aggressive goals in recent days , and said Saturday on Fox News that he plans to base his decision on when to adjust federal social distancing guidelines and ask businesses to reopen \u201c on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts . \u201d\nBut two of his health advisers , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn , argued Sunday for a decision based only on the former . In separate appearances on CNN \u2019 s State of the Union and ABC \u2019 s Meet the Press , both officials emphasized that their recommendations would be based solely on constantly changing data , hesitated to make firm or sweeping predictions , and challenged the notion that there is a single , set time when the entire country will be \u201c ready \u201d to resume life as it once was .\n\u201c It is not going to be a light switch that we say , \u2018 Okay it \u2019 s now June , July whatever \u2019 \u2014 click , the light switch goes back on , \u201d Fauci said on CNN . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be depending where you are in the country , the nature of the outbreak that you already experienced , and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced . \u201d\nTrump has made it clear that he would like to see relaxed social distancing and businesses reopened soon as possible . Less than three weeks ago , he said he hoped to have the economy \u201c opened up and raring to go by Easter , \u201d a goal that both health officials and economists warned would backfire because it would accelerate the spread of the coronavirus and likely lead to the rapid reshuttering of the economy . Recent reports suggest the president now hopes to begin a return to normal by May 1 , and there is growing pressure from some of his non-scientific advisers \u2014 as well as some Fox News personalities \u2014 to do so .\nOn Fox News \u2019 s Justice with Judge Jeanine Saturday , Trump twice emphasized that conditions would allow the economy to begin returning to normal \u201c soon , \u201d and when asked how he will decide when is the right time to advise businesses to reopen , the president gave a less measured answer than Fauci .\n\u201c I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people , a lot of professionals , doctors , and business leaders , \u201d he said . \u201c There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that . And it \u2019 s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts also . Whether we like it or not , there is a certain instinct to it . But we have to get our country back . \u201d\nThis is not the first time the president \u2019 s stance on his administration \u2019 s coronavirus response hasn \u2019 t exactly aligned with the stance of his experts . But the contrast between Trump \u2019 s eagerness to reopen the country based on his gut feelings and the cautious rhetoric of top health officials does help underscore how Trump \u2019 s decision-making process on the coronavirus is detached from expert counsel and haphazard in its execution .\nTrump \u2019 s health officials have been far more cautious and hesitant to offer gut-level appraisals about the future of the economy or when it will be safe to end social distancing .\nABC \u2019 s Martha Raddatz asked Hahn on Sunday if May 1 was \u201c a good target \u201d for reopening the economy . He responded by declining to set a date for the decision .\n\u201c It is a target , and obviously we \u2019 re hopeful about that target , but I think it \u2019 s just too early to be able to tell that we see light at the end of the tunnel , \u201d Hahn said . \u201c I think it \u2019 s just too early for us to say whether May 1 is that date . \u201d\nAnd Hahn was also careful to temper the optimism some have felt in seeing the confirmed case rate begin to decrease in a number of coronavirus hotspots , like New York . When asked if the worst has passed with coronavirus infections , Hahn said that the models show that \u201c we \u2019 re very close to the peak , \u201d but emphasized that it \u2019 s important to \u201c take this day by day as the data come in , because this has to be a data-driven approach . \u201d\nFauci , too , during his CNN appearance on Sunday , was emphatic about how difficult it is to prognosticate in such a complex situation .\n\u201c You \u2019 re trying to balance two things : You want to make sure you don \u2019 t do something prematurely and precipitously ; at the same time you pay attention to the need to try and get back to normal , \u201d he told Tapper .\nWhen Tapper repeatedly asked when exactly the economy might be restarted , Fauci replied , \u201c I think it could probably start at least in some ways maybe next month \u2014 and again , Jake , it \u2019 s so difficult to make those kinds of predictions . \u201d\n\u201c We are hoping that at the end of the month we can look around and say , \u2018 Okay , is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on ? \u2019 If so , do it , if not , then just continue to hunker down , \u201d Fauci added .\nWhether the president takes these words to heart remains to be seen .
