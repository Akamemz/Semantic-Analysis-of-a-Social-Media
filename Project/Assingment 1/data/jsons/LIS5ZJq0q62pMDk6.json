    "content": "Rep. Tom Cole may have said it best when he joked during a meeting of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday that \u201c it \u2019 s been great to listen to this debate over the soul of the Democratic Party . \u201d\nThe Oklahoma Republican was gently teasing his friend , Rep. George Miller ( D-Calif. ) , who had just had a heated exchange with a fellow liberal , Rep. Alcee Hastings ( D-Fla. ) , over pension legislation attached to a must-pass spending bill . Having spent years explaining to neighbors all the screaming from the Republican household , Cole welcomed the chance to look over the fence and gloat at the discord among Democrats .\nTwenty-four hours later , amid tense vote counting on the House floor , the laughs were harder to come by . But Cole \u2019 s remark and that old Watergate line\u2014 \u201c Follow the money \u201d \u2014are the best way to understand all the fireworks over an otherwise flat-line $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that finally cleared Congress on Saturday night .\nIndeed , with the loss of the Senate and President Barack Obama reduced to lame-duck status , Democrats in Congress seem torn between two choices : Dig in , or head to the hills and try to rebuild a guerrilla army .\nFor sure , Republicans still have their own problems . The GOP lost 67 of its own members in the House vote Thursday night ; Senate passage this weekend was stalled by Republican infighting and the open disdain by the Tea Party right toward the incoming Majority Leader , Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) .\nBut it \u2019 s the splits among Democrats that are the fresh news since November . And like the fading winter light outside the Capitol , these four days in December became their own reality check on what lies ahead for the party : less power over already limited government resources .\n\u201c This is the beginning of the new Congress . It \u2019 s not really the last fight of the last Congress , \u201d said Miller later . And while he \u2019 s now retiring to California , the lessons of November are plain for his party when it comes back in January . \u201c We \u2019 re fully aware there are no reinforcements , \u201d Miller said . \u201c There \u2019 s no bugle being sounded from our side . \u201d\nIn the case of the spending bill , Obama and Appropriations Committee Democrats chose the route of compromise even when it meant helping their past tormentor , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) . At the same time , Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California , a former speaker and appropriator herself , chose greater confrontation , abandoning old friends for an alliance with a new one , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) .\nIt was a vote for stability vs. a vote for spunk , a contest less about principle in the end than price , and to a striking degree , one dominated by four powerful women .\nPelosi and Warren were matched against the two top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees , Rep. Nita Lowey of New York and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland . How each pair handled a controversial regulatory carve-out for banks engaged in swaps trading was telling .\nPelosi and Warren saw the carve-out as a powerful symbol , even a bugle call , for Democrats to help the party reconnect with struggling families who aren \u2019 t enjoying the same recovery as the Wall Street banks already bailed out by Washington and now seeking concessions .\nThis populist narrative was helped , too , by the fact that Pelosi \u2019 s fellow top leaders in Congress had slipped in last-minute language allowing wealthy donors to give more to the political parties for the purposes of funding the national conventions\u2014a change Pelosi felt she was not fully informed of in advance .\nWhen Obama finally stepped in to tip the scales against her , Pelosi didn \u2019 t hide her disappointment at what she saw as a blown opportunity to revitalize the party . Friday night , in the most personal terms , Warren put down her marker on the Senate floor : blaming Citigroup directly and warning that if Wall Street wants to revisit the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law in the new Congress , she would use her voice to make it tougher .\n\u201c Enough is enough , \u201d she said . \u201c To anyone who is listening at Citi , I agree with you that Dodd-Frank isn \u2019 t perfect . It should have broken you into pieces . \u201d\nBy contrast , Lowey and Mikulski saw the same bank language as an irritant but also leverage with which to gain money to strengthen the very same regulators\u2014the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014charged with implementing Dodd-Frank .\nNeither woman had wanted the carve-out in the spending package , but with Republicans taking over the Senate next month , the common judgment\u2014shared by the White House\u2014was that the provision stood a very good chance of becoming law .\nLowey herself was one of 70 Democrats who had backed a free-standing House bill with almost identical language\u2014a measure that passed by a veto-proof 292-122 margin in 2013 . And by giving in to Republicans now , she and Mikulski were able to secure a total of $ 185 million more for the CFTC and SEC and protect the independence of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a past priority for Warren .\nFor all the inflammatory rhetoric about a \u201c sellout \u201d to Wall Street , the bottom-line critique was really that Lowey and Mikulski had just sold too cheap .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not very much , \u201d said former Rep. Barney Frank ( D-Mass . ) , who was appalled by the whole process . But Frank then quickly added that if the sum had been larger , \u201c There might have been a deal . \u201d\nMiller \u2019 s own pension amendment seems lost in this fray but also reflected the tough , divisive choices for his party after November .\nIn fact , the supreme irony of Thursday night was that this man\u2014who had been Pelosi \u2019 s strong right arm for years\u2014 should spend his last hours in the House fighting to save a bill against the wishes of the woman he had helped to make history .\nMost simply , the pension measure seeks to help financially strapped multi-employer plans by taking two steps . The first is an increase in the insurance premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp . The second is a precedent-setting change in law that will allow union workers and retirees the right to vote to trim benefits in hopes of avoiding still worse results if their pension plans fail .\nThis goes against the grain of Democrats like Hastings who argue that the bill makes it easier then to undercut what \u2019 s guaranteed workers in their retirement . But Miller answered that those guarantees are already fading in today \u2019 s economy . And it \u2019 s better for Democrats , he said , to give workers the option to make choices of their own to get through the storm .\n\u201c If we trust labor unions , and if we trust workers and we talk about the dignity of the worker , \u201d he challenged Hastings . \u201c How about the dignity of the worker deciding whether he , she or their co-workers can try to save their pension ? ... That \u2019 s all this bill does . There \u2019 s no mandate here . \u201d\n\u201c Do you agree it is a radical change in 40 years of law ? \u201d Hastings countered .\n\u201c It would be a radical change if I \u2019 m cutting their benefits , \u201d Miller answered , his voice rising in anger and left finger jabbing the air . \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s radical when you empower the people who have the greatest at stake to make a decision on their own behalf . \u201d\nThen after a short pause\u2014as if the words he had just said were sinking in\u2014Miller fell back in his chair and laughed : \u201c Well , actually , that would be fairy radical , \u201d he said .\nLater , in an interview , the California Democrat was just as blunt : \u201c There aren \u2019 t any guarantees , and [ after November \u2019 s elections ] there are no guys coming over the hill to deliver them , \u201d Miller said .\nIt \u2019 s this same reality that applies to Democrats and the remainder of the giant spending bill . Filling over 1,600 pages , the measure provides close to $ 1.1 trillion for the coming year , but inside the numbers , domestic appropriations are largely frozen in 2015 and won \u2019 t get any better in 2016 , the last year of Obama \u2019 s presidency .\nThese caps forced negotiators like Mikulski and Lowey to make scores of puts and takes to stay underneath . The Internal Revenue Service and Environmental Protection Agency , two favorite Republican targets , will absorb real cuts . But elsewhere the measure locks in modest increases for science and college affordability , for example , while preserving gains in early childhood education supported by the president .\nA little-noticed initiative makes Pell Grants more accessible to low-income students in career programs at community colleges . And after all the bitterness over immigration policy , the bill is quietly supportive of efforts to find attorneys for the thousands of unaccompanied children who crossed into the U.S. from Central America this year\u2014and now face deportation proceedings .\nAs seen already , the policy riders are a political minefield and will certainly get worse for Obama once Republicans are in full control next year .\nBut the Affordable Care Act and his climate change agenda are left largely intact for the moment . And on balance , both the White House and Agriculture Department were pleased that the final compromises tilted in favor of first lady Michelle Obama \u2019 s campaign to improve the nutrition standards for school lunches .\nFor much of his presidency , Obama has been famously detached from the gritty details of appropriations bills . And even with this package , he was surprisingly slow to step in and help save the giant measure in the House .\nYet with the economy beginning to grow , Obama has a real stake in the stability afforded by the agreement . This spending bill\u2014which builds on a similar one adopted last winter\u2014promises him a rare two-year window of relative order after all the prior shutdown and debt ceiling crises since Republicans won the House in 2010 .\nThe sole exception is the Department of Homeland Security , which remains on a short leash until Republicans decide how they will respond next year to Obama \u2019 s executive orders on immigration .\nFunding for DHS is extended only through February , and the bitterness of the immigration issue and Obama \u2019 s executive action can not be underestimated , as seen in the Senate this weekend .\nBut Homeland is not a hostage the GOP can afford to kill , since too many Republican priorities are affected , from border security to the troubled operations at the Secret Service . This could militate against a prolonged fight because as long as the department remains on a stopgap continuing resolution , or CR , Republicans know that these agencies will be shortchanged .\nIf a more stable government helps the economy , the bill is also a political asset for Obama since it defines a bipartisan benchmark from which future Republican-backed spending cuts will be made .\nA lot of the 2015 decisions are really about 2016 . This was part of the calculation in trying to pump up the CFTC and SEC at this stage even if it meant accepting the bank carve-out . For sure the CFTC will again be a target for the GOP . But with the $ 35 million increase in the bill now , the regulator will have established a budget level of $ 250 million\u2014still well below what the administration believes is needed but significantly better than just a few years ago .\nThe carve-out\u2014sought by Citigroup and other major Wall Street and regional banks\u2014will give them more flexibility to keep their hedging and swaps trading in-house , rather than being pushed out to a separate entity .\nWarren argues that the real goal is to continue to enjoy federal bank insurance while making these trades . But proponents of the modifications insist this is not the case . And the language inserted in the spending bill doesn \u2019 t alter the broad prohibition in Section 716 of Dodd-Frank against federal assistance for \u201c any swaps entity with respect to any swap , security-based swap , or other activity of the swaps entity . \u201d\nThe changes are \u201c worse procedurally than substantively , \u201d said Frank , who chaired the House Financial Services Committee and gave his name to Dodd-Frank . \u201c It weakens the bill somewhat , though I think there \u2019 s been a little hyperbole there . \u201d\nDerivatives in banks , he pointed out , are also covered by the so-called Volker rule , credited to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker and enacted in Dodd-Frank to curb speculative trading . Frank himself had not included what became Section 716 in his initial financial reform bill in the House . And in 2012 he chose not to fight those wanting some of the same modifications in dispute now .\nThat said , the legislative process used now is an \u201c outrage \u201d procedurally , he said , and a dangerous precedent . His fear is that banks will use more backroom deals to undo Dodd-Frank at a time when there is still anti-Wall Street sentiment in the country .\n\u201c If it was left out initially , I don \u2019 t think it would have been a major defect , \u201d Frank said of Section 716 . \u201c But at this point , now that they have integrated it into the rules that are going forward , it is very disruptive to pull it out . \u201d\n\u201c Unlike health care , financial reform was very popular , \u201d Frank said . \u201c They [ banks and Wall Street ] would never take it on , head on . This is the danger , that they do it in these kinds of ways . \u201d",

This is the danger, that they do it in these kinds of ways.\u201d",
