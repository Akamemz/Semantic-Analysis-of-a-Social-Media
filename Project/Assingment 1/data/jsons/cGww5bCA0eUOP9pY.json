Under that law, they can build complexes that are taller and have more units than a market-rate housing development. Can you explain the rationale behind that?\n\nWhat we\u2019re grappling with is the reality that affordable housing is very expensive to build and funding is always in short supply. [Editor\u2019s note: The cost of building a single unit of subsidized housing in California runs to $425,000, almost twice the national average.] Our new law will stretch those scarce dollars further by allowing affordable housing developments to be built more densely and taller so that we can build more units for exactly the same amount of money.\n\nWhat\u2019s your response to critics who say those kinds of bigger buildings will tear the fabric of the community that attracted them in the first place?\n\nWe have to think differently. I believe we can do this without upending the character of our cities and neighborhoods that we love. We\u2019re not talking about building skyscrapers on every inch of every city.
