Charles Booker , shown in the state capitol in Frankfort on Feb. 19 , 2020 , is challenging former Marine pilot Amy McGrath for the Democratic nomination to run against Sen. Mitch McConnell . Mr. Booker recently released his first TV ad , saying the race needs a \u201c real Democrat . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s now becoming an issue that has gotten to the top of the agenda , \u201d says Gayle Alberda , professor of politics and public administration at Fairfield University in Connecticut . \u201c It \u2019 s now surpassed health care , it \u2019 s surpassed other things like foreign affairs . Now we \u2019 re looking at conversations surrounding criminal justice , policing , and other sorts of issues concerning racial relations . \u201d\nIn some ways , the surge by Black progressives this election cycle was already part of a wider trend , experts say . Since 2018 , a number of Black women have taken the executive reins of major American cities , including London Breed in San Francisco , Lori Lightfoot in Chicago , and LaToya Cantrell in New Orleans .\nEven high-profile Black candidates who were not successful in 2018 , such as Democratic gubernatorial nominees Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida , likely helped pave the way for some of the candidates who followed .\n\u201c I do think those candidates provided a roadmap for newer Black politicians seeking office , and answered some questions about the kinds of coalitions they could build , \u201d says Mr. Johnson . \u201c How do you get Black voters , who actually tend to be more moderate , and white voters in Democratic primaries , who tend to be more liberal , all on the same team behind the same candidate ? \u201d\n\u201c I think what Black progressives are able to do is make the ideological policy appeals to white liberals while also making the sort of descriptive representation that appeals to Black voters , \u201d he says .\nIn taking on Mr. Engel , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Mr . Bowman hopes to follow the playbook of fellow New Yorker Ms. Ocasio-Cortez , the self-described Democratic Socialist who pulled off a surprise 2018 primary victory against former Rep. Joe Crowley , a powerful kingmaker in Queens and a ranking member in the House \u2019 s Democratic leadership team . Rep. Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts is another progressive woman of color who defeated a 10-term Democratic incumbent in 2018 .\n\u201c There is a really strong bench of young people coming up , and in many cases they are challenging those who are seen as insiders , moderates , or part of the existing leadership , \u201d says Jeanne Zaino , a professor of political science at Iona University in New Rochelle , New York .\nThe question , however , is whether white voters will indeed embrace candidates such as Mr . Bowman , who has also accepted the \u201c socialist \u201d label . Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won in a district in which half the residents are Hispanic , 18 % are white , and 11 % are Black . The district now represented by Mr. Engel includes some suburbs in Westchester county : A third of its residents are white , a third are Black , and a quarter are Hispanic .\nIn Virginia , 36-year-old physician and Black progressive Cameron Webb has made headway in a four-candidate race to become the Democratic nominee in the state \u2019 s 5th Congressional District , which includes Charlottesville . Though Republican-leaning overall , the district ousted incumbent Republican Rep. Denver Riggleman in a \u201c drive-thru convention \u201d earlier this month . A conservative Trump supporter , Mr. Riggleman appeared to lose party support after he officiated at a same-sex wedding . The open seat could now be more competitive in November .\n\u201c Charlottesville is a good area for Cameron Webb , \u201d says Mr. Johnson . \u201c Not only is it well-educated and with a very prestigious university there \u2013 which tends to signal a populace that leans on the liberal side \u2013 but also [ given ] the events of Charlottesville from a couple years ago and the ongoing Confederate statue debates the state \u2019 s having .
