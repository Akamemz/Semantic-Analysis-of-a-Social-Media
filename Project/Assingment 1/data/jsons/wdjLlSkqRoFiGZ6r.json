But coming on the heels of his recent Twitter attacks on the hosts of MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Morning Joe , \u201d and his reference in February to the nation \u2019 s news media as \u201c the enemy of the American people , \u201d many journalists took it seriously .\nThey saw not a joke but a dangerous portrayal of violence against their profession . The Committee to Protect Journalists and other professional organizations weighed in , and CNN issued a statement saying , \u201c It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters . \u201d\nAs press watchers and members of the media wrestle with the president \u2019 s rhetoric , some have begun to question a central tenet of modern journalism : striving to be objective and nonpartisan , conveying the news of the day with calm gravitas . But Mr. Trump is not the only disrupter in media ; his presidency coincides with fast-paced changes in society and technology that are also reshaping journalism .\n\u201c We are without a doubt now and into the future moving into a more interpretive , perspectival journalism , and the attempt to define \u2018 objectivity , \u2019 or \u2018 good journalism , \u2019 as a kind of stenography that gives facts and facts only is really outdated , \u201d says Stephen J . A . Ward , author of \u201c The Invention of Journalism Ethics : The Path to Objectivity and Beyond. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s not going to fly anymore , and I don \u2019 t even think it \u2019 s a good idea . \u201d\nThe question of the media \u2019 s proper role in society predates the current war of words between President Trump and the mainstream press , of course .

Free speech , enshrined in the First Amendment , is one of the bulwarks of individual liberty and equality .\nThis has not always included the idea of impartiality and objectivity , however .
