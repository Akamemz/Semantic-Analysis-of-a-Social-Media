Hours before the polls opened and people voted in the Republican primary here there was a steady stream of customers for the pit cooked barbecue chicken and barbecued ribs and , it seemed , more interest in what might happen over the long haul leading to November than who would win Saturday .\n\u201c My husband \u2019 s disabled , \u201d a woman who gave her name as Ella Mae Jenkins said as she waited for her takeout order of ribs , \u201c and my boy is overseas now , again , for the fourth time . \u201d\n\u201c Can \u2019 t say , \u201d she replied . \u201c He \u2019 s Air Force Special Ops and they do secret stuff so I ain \u2019 t sayin \u2019 . \u201d\nThe woman behind the counter put Ms. Jenkins \u2019 s order in a bag and Ella Mae walked to her car parked in a lot alongside a Piggly Wiggly market that \u2019 s been out of business for some time . She spoke briefly about her husband \u2019 s disability due to being badly wounded nearly 50 years ago at a place called Quang Tri City in a country then called South Vietnam .\n\u201c He \u2019 s had a hard life , but the good Lord let him live , \u201d she said . \u201c We \u2019 re thankful for that . \u201d\nShe said she had little interest in politics and paid hardly any attention to what the candidates were saying and that she would be happy when the campaign went to another state : \u201c Then I can watch my shows without seein \u2019 all these fools on my TV . \u201d\n\u201c Yes , sir . Fools , \u201d she said , uttering the word with an explanation point in the air . \u201c Damn fools . \u201c They all talkin \u2019 about killin \u2019 these terrorists like it \u2019 s some kinda \u2019 game .

The noise and power of their engines filled the air but Ms. Jenkins never looked up because their appearance is part of daily life here , where the reality of America \u2019 s military , its cost and duties as well as its existence are the framework for so many proud families who are charged with paying the price for loose political rhetoric .\nA few miles east , past the causeway above the Harbor River and down Malecon Drive , is the main gate at Marine Corps Recruit Depot East at Parris Island . Here the pine trees line much of the approach , some stretching 50 feet and higher and , then , on the Island there are fewer of them and the wind , warm now in mid-February , meets no obstacles as it whips through the day fluttering flags on the buildings that house the young who someday will be asked to fight for the dreams of the old who send them to war .\nHere , in South Carolina , memory is part of the cement of a culture rooted in service to the country . And here on Parris Island with roads named for bloodshed and lives lost in places like Chosin , Guadalcanal , Bataan and Quang Tri , the cheap chatter of candidates talking tough is merely muffled noise when measured against the drills and preparation of those who could be sent to places where polls and political ambition are meaningless . Here , the dreams and desires of those on the ballot live in a universe totally estranged from the future of the men and women who might one day face a bullet .\nListening to some of the Republican candidates for president is like eavesdropping on men trying to earn their letter sweater with worthless phrases : carpet bombing , crushing ISIS , as if words alone will accomplish the mission and the lives of those sent into the fight are merely an anonymous squadron of props used to advance a political agenda . The world is on fire , a dangerous place , and too many seeking to lead appear to be clueless or ignorant of what is required to keep the country secure .\nCharleston , South Carolina , is about a 90-minute drive northwest of Beaufort and Parris Island . It is an old city reborn with new charm and an influx of snowbirds from the North attracted by its ease , comfort and accessibility .\nIn the harbor , Fort Sumter is a constant reminder of the first shots fired in the Civil War .
