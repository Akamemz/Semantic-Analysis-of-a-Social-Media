It was an effort directed from the highest levels of the White House to use the power of the federal government to financially damage political opponents , including journalists . And the Nixon White House did more than send mean emails to reporters ; its aides actually plotted to kill a critical columnist .\nThe list in question was a 1971 memorandum from White House Counsel John Dean to White House Chief of Staff John Haldeman 's assistant entitled \u201c Dealing with our political enemies. \u201d Revealed during the Watergate hearings , its stated topic was \u201c how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies. \u201d The memo laid out a plan by which a \u201c good project coordinator \u201d would take requests from high ranking presidential aides about targets ; determine how to use the federal government 's power to damage them , including \u201c grant availability , federal contracts , litigation prosecution , etc \u201d ; and receive \u201c the full support of the top officials \u201d in federal agencies to implement that plan .\nThen there were the actions of Nixon administration and campaign official G.

As \u2588\u2588\u2588 has documented :\nLiddy served four and a half years in prison in connection with his conviction for his role in the Watergate break-in and the break-in at the office of the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsberg , the military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers . Liddy has acknowledged preparing to kill someone during the Ellsberg break-in \u201c if necessary \u201d ; plotting to murder journalist Jack Anderson ; plotting with a \u201c gangland figure \u201d to murder Howard Hunt to stop him from cooperating with investigators ; plotting to firebomb the Brookings Institution ; and plotting to kidnap \u201c leftist guerillas \u201d at the 1972 Republican National Convention -- a plan he outlined to the Nixon administration using terminology borrowed from the Nazis . ( The murder , firebombing , and kidnapping plots were never carried out ; the break-ins were . )\nJournalist Mark Feldstein has written that the plot to murder Anderson , a syndicated columnist critical of Nixon , originated with White House Special Counsel Chuck Colson . A 2010 Politico article details claims about the plot to kill Anderson from Feldstein 's book :\nLiddy and another Nixon operative , former CIA agent Howard Hunt , tailed the columnist and examined his Maryland home for \u201c vulnerabilities , \u201d Hunt recalled . And later , they met at the Hay Adams Hotel with a CIA physician involved in a plot to poison Fidel Castro and plotted the poisoning of Jack Anderson . They discussed painting the steering wheel of his car with enough LSD to make him have a car crash , or perhaps dropping a poisoned pill into his aspirin bottle . Liddy eventually suggested Anderson \u201c should just become a fatal victim of the notorious Washington street-crime rate. \u201d Liddy and Hunt eventually called off the plan because they had something more important to do : bug the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate .\nBy contrast , Woodward received an email from White House economic adviser Gene Sperling in which the aide stated , \u201c I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that [ President Obama ] asking for revenues is moving the goal post .
