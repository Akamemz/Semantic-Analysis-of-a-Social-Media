    "content": "Until recently , two US states did not require a unanimous jury verdict to convict defendants at felony criminal trials : Louisiana and Oregon . In both , a \u201c supermajority \u201d \u2014 meaning only 10 or more jurors out of 12 voting guilty \u2014 was sufficient to secure a conviction and a long sentence behind bars .\nVoters in Louisiana , a highly conservative state with the second-most prisoners in the nation , eschewed that system in favor of unanimity by ballot initiative in 2018 . Oregon , despite its false reputation as a peaceable hippie paradise , was the stubborn holdout , which made sense for those familiar with the backwardness of its elected prosecutors .\nNow , the Supreme Court has made its stance clear with its April 20 ruling in Ramos v. Louisiana ( 2020 ) . Unanimous verdicts are required under the Constitution , regardless of how many \u201c convictions \u201d have rested on 10-2 or 11-1 votes .\nIf the recent past is an indicator , courts in both Oregon and Louisiana are now going to be swamped with demands for post-conviction relief and retrials . After the Supreme Court terminated the legality of mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children in 2016 , thousands of people who are now adults were able to file for the second chance they thought they might never get . The courts found ways to manage , though progress is slower than advocates hoped for .\nSince Louisiana and Oregon are going to be inundated with new trial requests anyway , they should use this time as an opportunity for a \u201c reset \u201d of their criminal justice systems . That would mean taking ownership of how these systems have failed so many people , due to jury rules that were undeniably inspired by racism . It should also mean coming to terms with other ways in which these state criminal justice systems are uniquely problematic .\nLouisiana \u2019 s justice system is barbarically harsh toward even relatively minor criminal acts . After a young Black man tried to sell a bit of heroin to an undercover cop in Baton Rouge , he was sentenced to a 50-year term in prison . The judge lamented that he could not give life without parole to anyone who sells any amount of heroin , while District Attorney Hillar Moore , who falsely galivants as a \u201c reformer \u201d in the national speaking circuit , called the sentence \u201c appropriate. \u201d Derek Harris , a Black Gulf War veteran serving a life sentence for selling $ 30 of marijuana , is currently having his sentence reviewed by the Louisiana Supreme Court .\nThe state \u2019 s non-unanimity rule made things even worse in cases such as these , because the standout juror in an overzealous or flimsy prosecution was not worth being persuaded by her peers in the jury box . That juror could be ignored without consequence .\nOregonians might like to think they are better in this regard , as they live in a liberal state that talks up human rights . But a closer look shows that the actual practices of the state \u2019 s prosecutors bear closer comparison to the Deep South than most would expect .
