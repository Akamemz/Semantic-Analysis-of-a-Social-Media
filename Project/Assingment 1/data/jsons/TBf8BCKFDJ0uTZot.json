    "content": "We black people are so convenient and useful to America 's leftists . Whenever there 's a bit of silencing to be done , just accuse a detractor or critic of racism . A recent , particularly stupid , example is CNN 's Brandon Tensley 's complaint that the `` Coronavirus task force is another example of Trump administration 's lack of diversity . '' Tensley said the virus experts are `` largely the same sorts of white men ( and a couple women on the sidelines ) who 've dominated the Trump administration from the very beginning . '' I 'd like for Tensley to tell us just what racial or sex diversity contribute to finding a cure or treatment for the coronavirus .\nJesse Watters was criticized as a racist for claiming that the coronavirus outbreak was caused by Chinese people `` eating raw bats and snakes . '' He added that `` They are a very hungry people . The Chinese communist government can not feed the people , and they are desperate . This food is uncooked , it is unsafe and that is why scientists believe that 's where it originated from . '' Watter 's statement can be settled by a bit of empiricism . Just find out whether Chinese people eat bats and snakes and whether that has anything to do with the spread of the coronavirus .\nIt may be perplexing to some , but I believe that our nation has made great progress in matters of race , so much so that imaginary racism and racial hoaxes must be found . Left-wingers on college campuses and elsewhere have a difficult time finding the racism that they say permeates everything . So they 're brazenly inventing it .\nJussie Smollett charged that two masked Trump supporters , wearing MAGA hats , using racial and homophobic insults attacked him . The anti-Trump media gobbled up Smollett 's story hook , line and sinker , but it turned out to be a hoax .\nA large percentage of hate-crime hoaxes occur on college campuses . Andy Ngo writes about this in his City Journal article `` Inventing Victimhood : Universities too often serve as 'hate-crime hoax ' mills . '' St. Olaf College in Minnesota was roiled in mass `` anti-racism '' protests that caused classes to be canceled . It turned out that a black student activist was found to be responsible for a racist threat she left on her own car . Five black students at the U.S. Air Force Academy Preparatory School found racial slurs written on their doors . An investigation later found that one of the students targeted was responsible for the vandalism .\nAndy Ngo writes that there are dozens of other examples . They all point to a sickness in American society , with our institutions of higher education too often doubling as `` hate-hoax mills , '' encouraged by a bloated grievance industry in the form of diversity administrators . These are diversity-crazed administrators , along with professors of race and gender studies , who nationwide spend billions of dollars on diversity and a multiculturalist agenda . Racial discord and other kinds of strife are their meal tickets to greater influence and bigger budgets .\nThere 's another set of beneficiaries to racial hoaxes and racial strife . These alleged incidents are invariably seized upon by politicians and activists looking to feed a sacrosanct belief among liberals that discrimination and oppression are the main drivers of inequality . Jason Riley , writing in The Wall Street Journal says `` In the mainstream media we hear almost constant talk about scary new forms of racism : 'white privilege , ' 'cultural appropriation , ' and 'subtle bigotry .

'' Reilly put together a data set of more than 400 confirmed cases of fake allegations that were reported to authorities between 2010 and 2017 . He says that the exact number of false reports is probably unknowable , but what can be said `` with absolute confidence is that the actual number of hate crime hoaxes is indisputably large . We are not speaking here of just a few bad apples . '' But Reilly has a larger point to make , writing , `` The Smollett case is n't an outlier . Increasingly , it 's the norm .
