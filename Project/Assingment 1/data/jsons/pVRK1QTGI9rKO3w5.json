    "content": "A few weeks ago , the Fresh Face of the Democratic Party , Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , gave one of the great defenses in the history of politics . Accused of fibbing and twisting facts to meet her radical agenda , Ocasio-Cortez explained , `` I think that there 's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely , factually and semantically correct than about being morally right . '' Her statement was widely derided . But it is indeed the mantra of today 's politics . The narrative must be preserved at all costs -- even the cost of the truth .\nTake , for example , Ocasio-Cortez 's ridiculous statements this week on the state of modern America . She explained that her plan to radically restructure the American economy is necessitated by the fact that `` the world is gon na end in 12 years if we do n't address climate change . '' She added : `` And your biggest issue is how are we gon na pay for it ? And like , this is the war -- this is our World War II . '' Now , put aside her Nostradamus-like assertion regarding the incoming apocalypse . The important part followed : `` How are we saying , 'Take it easy , ' when the America that we 're living in today is so dystopian with people sleeping in their cars so they can work a second job without health care and we 're told to settle down . ''\nNow , when President Trump describes America as a dystopia rife with crime and suffering , the media point out that America is hardly a hellhole -- we 're the most prosperous country in the history of the world . But when the charming AOC uses her false depiction of America to press for higher marginal tax rates , we 're supposed to buy her story .\nThis gap between the facts and the narrative dominates our politics . Here 's how the narrative chain works : Somebody makes a fact-free accusation of X , which supports the more general narrative , Y , supported by the political left or right . Opponents debunk X . That attempt to debunk X is taken as evidence that opponents do n't take the problem of Y seriously enough . Facts are marshaled to show that Y is true , even if X is n't . In a peculiar way , the lack of facts to back X lends passion to those who defend Y -- it allows them to malign the motives of those who do n't defend Y .\nLet 's take an example . The students of Covington Catholic High School are accused of mobbing and mocking a Native American veteran . This incident supports the broader narrative that Trump supporters , religious Americans and young white men are emissaries of racism and toxic masculinity . Then it turns out that the video has been taken wildly out of context and deliberately misinterpreted . Many advocates of the narrative immediately declare that while this incident is a poor example , the overall narrative is true -- and that leaping to conclusions will be justified next time , in order to prove that the overall narrative ought to be taken seriously . The only price : whomever is next maligned without facts .\nThis pattern will continue to dominate our politics so long as we ascribe malign motives to those who wait for the facts to emerge -- and so long as we reward those who jump to conclusions in taking Y seriously . Waiting must become the order of the day . If it does n't , politics is going to get a lot worse , and quickly .",
