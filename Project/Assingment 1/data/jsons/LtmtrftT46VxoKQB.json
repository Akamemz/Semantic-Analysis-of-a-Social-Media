Some of the CEOs the administration drew support from during Obama\u2019s first term are leaving the business or moving on to other things.\n\nStill, energy insiders overall say these types of climate thinkers can help Obama advance a second-term strategy that relies on dribbling out regulations and industry-specific agreements with less focus on pushing legislation through Congress.\n\n\u201cThere are two types of people who can be influential here,\u201d said Manik Roy, vice president for strategic outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, whose 30-year environmental career includes stops at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Hill. \u201cThose who will shape the options that the president faces \u2014 how ambitious will the emission standard be, what the timing of it will be, that sort of thing \u2014 and those who will help the president decide whether to go forward with a given option.\u201d\n\nHere are several crucial players in the climate debate:\n\n1. Denis McDonough\n\nThe president\u2019s green brain trust starts with his chief of staff \u2014 best known as the former deputy national security adviser whom the president described last month as \u201cone of my closest, most trusted advisers.\u201d\n\nLess well known is the fact that Denis McDonough has spoken for years about the urgency of tackling global warming and assuring supporters that Obama\u2019s heart is in it.\n\nObama \u201crecognizes very clearly that this is an urgent problem that we\u2019ve now lost far too much time in addressing,\u201d McDonough said during a May 2007 discussion hosted by the Brookings Institution, speaking as a campaign surrogate. Inserting a personal touch, the Minnesota native noted, \u201cWhen I was home at the holidays, there was no ice fishing this year for the first time that I can remember in a long time.\u201d\n\nThe same year, he co-wrote an op-ed for the Center for American Progress on the \u201cobligation\u201d the U.S. and other wealthy countries owe to help poor nations cope with climate change.\n\nAs chief of staff, McDonough will help Obama navigate the hugely symbolic decision on whether to approve TransCanada\u2019s Keystone XL oil pipeline, a lightning rod for green critics. He\u2019ll also oversee the rollout of EPA greenhouse gas regulations, one of several ways the administration can move forward without Congress.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama words turn up Keystone heat)\n\nMcDonough might also have a role in choosing who gets the reins of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which signs off on EPA rules. Former OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein, who had a reputation for slow-walking regulations, left in August.\n\nMore broadly, McDonough can ensure that climate retains a prime spot in the president\u2019s inbox \u2014 much the way former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former senior adviser David Axelrod helped steer the health care agenda in Obama\u2019s first two years.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Emily Howell @ 02/04/2013 10:33 AM CORRECTION: A previous version of this story did not make it clear which organization Michael Yackira is set to become chairman of in June.
