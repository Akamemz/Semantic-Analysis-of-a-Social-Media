Trump and first lady Melania Trump : Melania and I join with a grieving Nation to mourn the loss of former President George H.W . Bush , who passed away last night .\nThrough his essential authenticity , disarming wit , and unwavering commitment to faith , family , and country , President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service \u2014 to be , in his words , `` a thousand points of light '' illuminating the greatness , hope , and opportunity of America to the world .\nPresident Bush always found a way to set the bar higher . As a young man , he captained the Yale baseball team , and then went on to serve as the youngest aviator in the United States Navy during the Second World War . Later in life , he rose to the pinnacle of American politics as a Congressman from Texas , envoy to China , Director of Central Intelligence , Vice President of eight years to President Ronald Reagan , and finally President of the United States .\nWith sound judgement ( sic ) , common sense , and unflappable leadership , President Bush guided our Nation , and the world , to a peaceful and victorious conclusion of the Cold War . As President , he set the stage for the decades of prosperity that have followed . And through all that he accomplished , he remained humble , following the quiet call to service that gave him a clear sense of direction .\nAlong with his full life of service to country , we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family \u2014 especially the love of his life , Barbara .

Ambassador to the United Nations . Director of Central Intelligence . U.S . Envoy to China . Vice President of the United States .\nGeorge H.W . Bush 's life is a testament to the notion that public service is a noble , joyous calling . And he did tremendous good along the journey . Expanding America 's promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities . Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait . And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe , it was his steady , diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but -- ending the Cold War without firing a shot .\nIt 's a legacy of service that may never be matched , even though he 'd want all of us to try .\nAfter seventy-three years of marriage , George and Barbara Bush are together again now , two points of light that never dimmed , two points of light that ignited countless others with their example -- the example of a man who , even after commanding the world 's mightiest military , once said `` I got more of a kick out of being one of the founders of the YMCA in Midland , Texas back in 1952 than almost anything I 've done . ''\nWhat a testament to the qualities that make this country great . Service to others . Commitment to leaving behind something better .

He never stopped serving . I saw it up close , working with him on tsunami relief in Asia and here at home after Hurricane Katrina . His remarkable leadership and great heart were always on full display .\nI am profoundly grateful for every minute I spent with President Bush and will always hold our friendship as one of my life 's greatest gifts .
