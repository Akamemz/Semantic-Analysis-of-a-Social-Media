    "content": "In a Friday Bloomberg op-ed , Ramesh Ponnuru details how \u201c immigration is rapidly becoming a defining issue for American conservatism. \u201d Ponnuru suggests that this may prove problematic for donor-class favorite Sen. Marco Rubio , who supports immigration expansions\u2014which Pew Research says are opposed by more than 9 in 10 GOP voters .\nJust as conservative candidates for President can not be selected if they support abortion , Obamacare or gun control , Ponnuru explains that the new litmus test of conservatism is immigration . \u201c Conservatives are now starting to see a candidate \u2019 s position on immigration as an index of his conservatism in general , \u201d Ponnuru writes .\nPonnuru notes how the conservative creed \u2019 s adoption of immigration limits mirrors the Party \u2019 s transformation on the issue of abortion . That is , just as today a conservative candidate can not run for president supporting abortion , they can no longer run for president supporting amnesty and transformative large-scale immigration :\nAbortion politics followed a similar trajectory . Opposing abortion wasn \u2019 t always considered part and parcel of conservatism . Everybody considered Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative even though he supported legal abortion . Over time , though , as conservatives grew more opposed to abortion and liberals more supportive of it , it became an issue that voters used to sort candidates by ideology\u2026 voters who knew that a candidate opposed it could also be reasonably sure that he would oppose gun control and tax increases \u2014 or , at least , that he was more likely to oppose it than someone who favored legal abortion . Candidates who favored legal abortion started to have real trouble getting support from a lot of conservative voters . Eventually , such candidates came to be seen as not being conservatives at all . Today , favoring tighter control of immigration is becoming a stand-in for conservatism in the same way .\nIndeed , in an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly explained how the Republican Party was not always pro-life and detailed her fundamental role in helping conservatives win that battle within the Republican Party . \u201c We made the Republican Party pro-life\u2014 it used to be pro-abortion , \u201d Schalfly explained .\nWhen asked about what she viewed as the biggest fight within the GOP today and the most pressing issue currently facing the country , Schlafly\u2014 without hesitation\u2014said , \u201c Immigration . And that \u2019 s why Trump is doing so well\u2026 if we don \u2019 t stop immigration , this torrent of immigrants coming in , we \u2019 re not going to be America anymore . \u201d\nAnn Coulter has similarly argued that the reason this election cycle \u2019 s presidential debates have been so uninteresting is because the moderators keep asking questions about ideological battles within the GOP which have already been settled\u2014such as abortion\u2014 while avoiding the current war within the Republican Party , which centers upon immigration .\nIn August , after the first Republican presidential debate , Coulter wrote on twitter : \u201c We won the abortion fight ( in the GOP ) 30 years ago ! \u201d and added , \u201c Absolutely , positively no GOP candidate 4 POTUS will ever be for abortion , \u201d concluding in all caps that \u201c IMMIGRATION IS THE NEW LITMUS TEST \u201d .\nConservative populist thought-leader Sen. Jeff Sessions has explained that supporting amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants should be inherently disqualifying for any GOP nominee . Sessions said previously , \u201c Supporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying . Just like we can \u2019 t have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare , we can \u2019 t have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty . \u201d\n\u2026everything wrong with Washington . It was a bill written of , by and for the special interests . Despite today \u2019 s record high immigration\u2014and four decades of stagnant pay\u2013the Gang of Eight bill doubled the number of foreign workers allowed into the country every year . And it tripled the number of permanent residents added over its first decade . This is a hammer blow to working Americans . Our nominee needs to serve the 92 % of GOP voters who want to constrain future immigration growth\u2013not expand it even further . That \u2019 s the immigration reform voters want .\nAt a recent event in Daphne , Alabama , Sessions warned that \u201c This election is going to decide\u2013did the crowd who pushed that bill , are they in the White House ? And will they be able to continue their agenda ? Or will somebody else be there who will say , \u2018 No . ' \u201d\nThe open-borders enthusiasts in Washington , Sessions explained , \u201c are not through . They are determined . They \u2019 ve got money , interest groups , power , media that support this agenda and the next president who gets elected is going to determine what kind of immigration system we have . \u201d\nPonnuru seems to recognize that the emergence of immigration restrictions as a tenet of conservatism has perhaps hurt Sen. Marco Rubio , who co-authored an immigration agenda which , in Ponnuru \u2019 s words , \u201c would increase legal immigration , allow many illegal immigrants to become citizens , and start them on that path even if new enforcement measures against further illegal immigration turn out to be ineffective . \u201d\nTonally , Ponnuru \u2019 s declaration that immigration has become a part of \u201c conservatives \u2019 creed \u201d seems to represent an evolution for Ponnuru\u2014 a so-called \u201c Reformicon \u201d whose movement was closely aligned with immigration expansionist Eric Cantor , Ponnuru \u2019 s own views not withstanding .\nHis recent writing seems to suggest that he now recognizes with greater force the potency of the immigration issue amongst the GOP electorate . However , Ponnuru explains that despite Rubio \u2019 s opposition to the Republican electorate on this issue , he could still snag the nomination . \u201c Rubio could win even if opponents of his immigration record successfully define him as an \u2018 establishment \u2019 candidate , \u201d Ponnuru writes . \u201c After all , parties usually nominate establishment candidates . \u201d\nThis suggests that Rubio \u2019 s opponents may have to shift their strategies\u2014 especially as more progressive Republicans running alongside Rubio drop out\u2014 and instead focus on how Rubio \u2019 s immigration positions put him outside the mainstream of American thought . Senator Sessions , for instance , has repeatedly described the policies enshrined in the Gang of Eight bill as \u201c extreme , \u201d and \u201c radical. \u201d A poll conducted by Kellyanne Conway , for example , found that by nearly a 10-1 ratio Americans reject the platform of importing more foreign workers that has defined Senator Rubio \u2019 s career . Further , by a nearly five-to-one margin , GOP voters believe so-called \u201c free trade , \u201d lowers wages rather than raises them , and yet Senator Rubio provided the pivotal 60th vote to fast-track Obamatrade and described Obama \u2019 s Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement as part of the \u201c second pillar \u201d of Rubio \u2019 s three-pillar foreign policy strategy .\nFiveThirtyEight \u2019 s Nate Silver has explained how the Republican establishment could throw the 2016 race to Rubio . Silver explains that this is because the Establishment has the \u201c persuasive power to set the rules of engagement and strategically encourage winnowing of the field \u201d :\nImagine that the party establishment is the referee in a boxing match . It has one boxer it would prefer to see win . But it can \u2019 t rig the match once it \u2019 s underway . However , it can choose when to call the fight . So if its preferred boxer \u2014 let \u2019 s call him Red \u2014 is winning early , it can call the fight after a couple of rounds . But if he \u2019 s losing , they can let the fight keep going and hope he prevails on the basis of his stamina\u2026he \u2019 s getting a lot of second and third chances when his opponent might not . And that makes his overall odds pretty good . He just has to lead at any point and the refs can call the match .\nShould this effort to install Rubio as the nominee be successful , it would mean a maximum of seven percent of GOP voters would have their views represented on immigration levels . According to Pew , only 7 % of GOP voters want more immigration ; since Rubio \u2019 s plan would have tripled green cards , the share who support Rubio \u2019 s vision is likely substantially smaller than seven percent .\nBy contrast , a May 2014 Gallup poll found that 28 % of Democrats identify as pro-life . In other words , a much larger slice of the Democrat electorate would be represented by a pro-life Democrat nominee than the miniscule share of the GOP electorate that would be represented by a pro-mass immigration candidate .\nOver the next ten years , the U.S. will issue more green cards than there are men , women and children currently living in Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina\u2014on top of the 59 million immigrants already admitted since 1965 . Rubio \u2019 s push to expand the record rate of immigration even higher will , ironically , disenfranchise the GOP voters Rubio is courting .\nPro-amnesty lawmaker and mass migration supporter Trey Gowdy , who has endorsed Rubio , received around 126,452 votes in his last election ; in the span of one decade , Rubio \u2019 s bill would have brought in 261 immigrants for every one Gowdy voter . Pro-amnesty lawmaker Jason Chaffetz , who similarly endorsed Rubio , received around 94,571 votes\u2014or nearly three times less voters than Muslim migrants admitted to the U.S. each year . Yet Rubio \u2019 s new I-Squared bill dramatically expands Muslim immigration .\nAs it stands now , 76 % of Republicans oppose stricter gun control while 92 % percent oppose more immigration , meaning that the party \u2019 s electorate is more opposed to Sen. Rubio \u2019 s foreign worker policy than they are to Democrats \u2019 push for tighter gun control laws .",
