    "content": "The same President Trump who can be gruff and erratic in public tweets is a commander in chief who is deferential and attentive when he talks to a star-studded cast of his closest military advisers .\nPeople familiar with the budding relationships portray Mr. Trump as often in listening mode among his generals and as accessible as the next phone call . They contrast the billionaire real estate developer \u2019 s affinity for the top brass with former President Barack Obama \u2019 s documented standoffishness .\nThe Tomahawk strike on Syria on Friday underscores that Washington \u2019 s warrior class is again in charge of presenting military options to the White House instead of the other way around .\nWith three Marines and a soldier always nearby , perhaps no president in recent memory has surrounded himself on a daily basis with so many senior generals and their strategic brainpower .\nA retired Marine general , James Mattis runs the Defense Department . His and Mr. Trump \u2019 s top military adviser is Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .\nAnother retired Marine four-star general , John F. Kelly is responsible for protecting 325 million U.S. residents as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security .\nAnd Mr. Trump \u2019 s always-present national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , is an active-duty Army lieutenant general steeped in battlefield history and doctrine .\nAll four have fought on the ground in Iraq against radical Islam . They bring to Mr. Trump a deep collective knowledge of that country \u2019 s tribes and politicians who will lead a post-Islamic State Iraq . Unlike Mr. Trump , these scholar warriors are also voracious readers . Gen. McMaster , for example , wrote a book on how Lyndon B. Johnson bamboozled the Joint Chiefs during the Vietnam War .\nBut they share the body clock of a president who sleeps only several hours a day as well as a disdain for political correctness .\nA retired military officer who knows the generals told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the president has grown particularly close to Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly . Lean and rugged , both rose in the Marine Corps on parallel career paths culminating in leading combatant commands \u2014 for Mr. Mattis , U.S. Central Command ( Middle East ) ; for Mr. Kelly , U.S. Southern Command ( southern border ) .\n\u201c No . 1 , they get along very well , \u201d said the former officer . \u201c I call it street sense . They know how to talk the line , and Trump does too . Trump is like talking to a concrete worker . These two generals have got a man who listens and does not pretend like Obama and others to know everything . When the president is out of his lane and needs advice , these guys are right in there . \u201d\nSaid Dakota Wood , a retired Marine officer and Heritage Foundation analyst who worked on the transition : \u201c The president seems to like very successful sports figures . It could be that he is attracted to the legendary reputation that accompanies the Marine Corps and through that lens the accomplishments of four-star Marine generals , amplified by their typical plain-spoken , reality-based style of addressing issues . \u201d\nAnother retired military officer and transition member said that part of the allure of Mattis-Kelly-Dunford-McMaster is that they have never been part of the Washington \u201c swamp \u201d that Mr. Trump has vowed to drain .\n\u201c He \u2019 s much more comfortable around military people , \u201d said this source . \u201c You could tell that at the Army-Navy game when he went to both sides . The generals are not politicians . They \u2019 re not part of the Washington swamp . They \u2019 re all successful in their career , and they are not part of the Washing swamp of bureaucracy bull . \u201d\nIn contrast , Mr. Obama had a famously cool relationship with his generals , as told by his former defense secretaries .\nHis first defense secretary , Robert M. Gates , wrote in his memoir , \u201c Duty , \u201d that Mr. Obama felt compelled in one meeting to command , \u201c That \u2019 s an order . \u201d\n\u201c That order was unnecessary and insulting , proof positive of the depth of the Obama White House distrust of the nation \u2019 s military leadership , \u201d a \u201c shocked \u201d Mr. Gates wrote .\n\u201c The controlling nature of the Obama White House and the staff took micromanagement and operational meddling to a new level , \u201d he said . \u201c I think Obama considered time spent with generals and admirals an obligation . \u201d\nRetired Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove , while NATO supreme allied commander , encountered so much troubling communication with the White House that he asked former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell for help .\n\u201c I may be wrong but I do not see this WH really \u2018 engaged \u2019 by working with Europe/NATO , \u201d Gen. Breedlove wrote . \u201c Frankly I think we are a \u2018 worry \u2019 ie a threat to get the nation drug into a conflict vice an \u2018 opportunity \u2019 represented by some pretty stalwart allies . \u201d\nMr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly retired in the Obama years . Congressional aides said the White House pushed out Mr. Mattis as Central Command chief because of his tough Iran stance . Mr. Kelly delivered hawkish Senate testimony on border security that the administration did not approve .\nMr. Trump signaled during the election campaign that he would bond with the top brass when he accused Mr. Obama of turning his generals into \u201c rubble . \u201d\nMr. Trump has stacked the West Wing with campaign confidants : campaign manager Kellyanne Conway , his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner , former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon .\nAll have something in common : They have no experience navigating the federal government \u2019 s byzantine and sometimes treacherous bureaucracy .\n\u201c Mattis and Kelly understand that the president and the people around him really know nothing about government and how it works , \u201d the former officer told The Times . \u201c Instead of being critical , they just understand that . They \u2019 ve been very helpful to Bannon and the other people around them . \u201d\nGen. McMaster , the Army soldier among the Marines , also listens to them .\n\u201c Remember , he \u2019 s a three-star . Not a four-star . I can tell you he relies on both Mattis and Kelly a lot , \u201d the ex-officer said . \u201c They just operated for a lot of years at the World Series level in this government . And they know how government works . \u201d\nEven before the Syria strike , which shifted Mr. Trump from Russian President Vladimir Putin admirer to adversary , the president was moving in the direction of the generals in his administration .\nHe narrowed his broad criticism of NATO allies to just one issue \u2014 paying their fair share \u2014 while adopting Mr. Mattis \u2018 view that the alliance is the world \u2019 s indispensable partnership .\nThe four generals whose careers focused so much on the Middle East are pushing for building a new Arab alliance to check Iran and fight the Islamic State .\nThis is why , in quick succession , the White House played host to a parade of pivotal leaders : Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi , Jordan \u2019 s King Abdullah II and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\nMr. Trump also granted wide authority to Gen. McMaster to mold the National Security Council and staff in his image .\nWithin weeks , the general remade membership of the NSC decision-making principals committee \u2014 the one that weighed options to respond to Syria \u2019 s sarin nerve gas attack on civilians . Gen. McMaster eased out Mr. Bannon as a permanent member . He brought on Gen. Dunford and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats as standing members instead of invitees .\n\u201c So the president was immediately notified upon news of the chemical attack , and he was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible , \u201d is how Gen. McMaster described the beginning of war cabinet discussions .\nOf the NSC shake-up , White House press secretary Sean Spicer said , \u201c We had talked about the fact that he would have full authority to oversee the National Security Council in terms of personnel and structure , and he has . \u201d\nMr. Kelly was viewed as \u201c taking the hit \u201d for the White House \u2019 s missteps on the president \u2019 s first executive order travel ban , which was blocked by federal judges . The former Marine general appeared before the press and Congress to discourage talk that he was out of the loop and at odds with the White House .\nWhen Democrats demanded a briefing on the Homeland Security Department \u2019 s hunt for criminal illegal aliens , Mr. Kelly picked himself to enter the firing line . He survived several heated exchanges .\nHe refers to the president as \u201c boss \u201d yet wishes the president would not make so many references to building a wall along the southwestern border , a project still in search of long-range funding .\nThe president summoned Mr. Kelly to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida , one weekend to brainstorm the writing of a second executive order on travel from predominately Muslim countries . This one removed Iraq from the ban , a concession insiders attribute to Mr. Kelly and his knowledge of the vetting capability in Baghdad .\nThe knowledgeable former military officer told The Times that he believes Mr. Kelly , Mr. Mattis and Gen. McMaster have had an influence in getting Mr. Trump to tamp down his steady stream of volatile tweets that take the White House off message .\nRetired Air Force Gen. Thomas McInerney , a veteran of Pentagon bureaucracy wars , said he believes Mr. Trump learned to love the military as a cadet at the New York Military Academy .\n\u201c Certainly Gen. Kelly and Gen. Mattis interviewed well because both are extremely talented leaders as well as former combatant commanders and know their areas of responsibility very well , \u201d Mr. McInerney said . \u201c In Gen. Kelly \u2019 s case , he was South Command commander where our greatest challenges of illegal immigrants as well as illegal drug importation are coming from , so his learning curve was zero .
