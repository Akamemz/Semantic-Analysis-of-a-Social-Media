    "content": "Publicly , Republican Party officials continue to stand by Donald Trump . Privately , at the highest levels , party leaders have started talking about cutting off support to Trump in October and redirecting cash to save endangered congressional majorities .\nSince the Cleveland convention , top party officials have been quietly making the case to political journalists , donors and GOP operatives that the Republican National Committee has done more to help Trump than it did to support its 2012 nominee Mitt Romney , and that therefore Trump has only himself and his campaign to blame for his precipitous slide in the polls , according to people who have spoken with Republican leadership .\nSean Spicer , the RNC \u2019 s top strategist , on Wednesday made that case to 14 political reporters he convened at the organization \u2019 s Capitol Hill headquarters for an off-the-record conversation about the election .\nAccording to several people who attended , Spicer spent much of the session detailing all the RNC resources that have been deployed to swing states and how the party \u2019 s infrastructure is stronger than it has ever been .\nIn the words of one person in the room , the message was that the RNC has \u201c all these staffers out there working and knocking on doors , with a data system they believe rivals what Obama build in 2012 \u2014 so it \u2019 s not their fault . \u201d\nSpicer emphasized that RNC chairman Reince Priebus has been working aggressively to coach Trump into being a more disciplined candidate , calling the nominee \u201c five or six times a day , \u201d according to another person present at last week \u2019 s closed-door meeting .\nAccording to sources close to Priebus , the chairman has warned that if Trump does not better heed this persistent advice to avoid dustups driven by his rhetoric , the RNC might not be able to help him as much \u2014 suggesting that money and ground resources might be diverted .\nTo this point , Spicer has suggested a mid-October deadline for turning around the presidential campaign , suggesting last week to reporters and in separate discussions with GOP operatives that it would cause serious concern inside the RNC if Trump were to remain in a weakened position by then .\nOperatives close to the RNC leadership who have heard this argument from party leadership , say the committee might have to make a decision about pulling the plug on Trump before that .\n\u201c Early voting in Ohio starts in a few weeks , there \u2019 s a 45-day window for absentee voters , so mid-September would probably be the latest the RNC could redeploy assets and have any real impact , \u201d said an RNC member privately . \u201c The only thing you could change in mid-October would be to shift some TV ads , maybe try to prop up Senate candidates in tough races like [ Rob ] Portman , [ Marco ] Rubio and [ Pat ] Toomey . \u201d\nOne high-level Republican strategist added : \u201c The party committee has this same job every cycle , to employ limited resources to maximum effect at the ballot box . ... And that means not pouring precious resources into dysfunctional , noncooperative , losing campaigns . \u201d\nSpicer , asked Saturday night about the ongoing discussions , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Trump could not be cut off soon because the party needs him to raise more money . \u201c When I \u2019 ve gotten these questions , I \u2019 ve been correcting the record . There is no talk of shifting resources in mid-August and it \u2019 s unlikely that would happen until late September or October . \u201d\nHe also said the RNC did not view the current polling deficit suffered by Trump to be impossible to overcome .\nBut on Thursday , \u2588\u2588\u2588 revealed that more than 70 Republicans had signed a letter to Priebus that urged him to immediately cut off spending on Trump and to shift cash to saving the party \u2019 s congressional majorities instead .\nWithin the Trump campaign , there has been suspicion for months that the RNC already has not been as supportive of its nominee as it could \u2014 and should \u2014 be , according to operatives in and around the campaign .\n\u201c There \u2019 s lingering doubt , \u201d said one operative who has worked with the campaign . \u201c It 's never really improved much , and never for long. \u201d The operative dismissed efforts to withhold RNC support from Trump as \u201c only coming from the usual suspects \u2014 the same crap from the same Republicans who can \u2019 t win elections . \u201d\nOne Trump staffer dismissed the possibility that the RNC might cut off funding to the nominee and downplayed talk of tension between the entities . The staffer said he communicates with his party counterparts \u201c multiple times a day and the interactions are 100 percent good . \u201d\nOther Trump allies in and around the campaign fear that the RNC could use Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2019 s widening lead in polls to justify pulling the plug on Trump before he has a chance to even the race .\nRNC fundraisers have in fact been signaling to major donors a way that they could write huge checks to Trump \u2019 s joint fundraising committee with the RNC and dictate that only a fraction \u2014 if any \u2014 of the cash would go to Trump .\nSpicer has said RNC fundraisers are not communicating this sentiment .\nBut one fundraiser with knowledge of the party \u2019 s high-dollar fundraising efforts said earlier this summer that the message to leery donors was \u201c people can give to the RNC and not to him . \u201d\nThrough the end of June \u2014 the period covered by the most recent Federal Election Commission filings \u2014 the main Trump-RNC joint fundraising committee had transferred only $ 2.2 million to Trump \u2019 s campaign , compared with $ 10.1 million to the RNC .\nThe committee , Trump Victory , still had $ 12.1 million in the bank at that point . And his campaign announced that it had combined with the joint committee to raise $ 80 million in July , though it \u2019 s unclear how much of that was transferred to his campaign , as opposed to the party .\nTrump himself declared Thursday that he \u2019 s doing more to boost the RNC \u2019 s coffers than the campaign is doing for him , and warned that he might back out of the joint fundraising arrangement .\nBy Friday , though , Trump was praising Priebus for doing \u201c such a great job .
