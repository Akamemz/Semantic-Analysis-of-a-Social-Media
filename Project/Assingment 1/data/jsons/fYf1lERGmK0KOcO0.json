Mr. Obama sat up in surprise and said \u201c no. \u201d But , after a search for words , the president said he shoots skeet sometimes at Camp David before adding that he \u2019 s not much \u201c of a marksman. \u201d When he said that anyone who enjoys the shotgun sports knew he must not have shot skeet much , as \u201c marksmanship \u201d is a term used for target shooting , not by those who shoot skeet , trap or sporting clays .\nWhen Cooper shifted the discussion to why the president chose to use executive actions on the gun issue , instead of working with Congress , Cooper asked the president if he would meet with the NRA . The president said , \u201c I \u2019 m happy to meet with the NRA , \u201d but as he said it he had this snarky smile on his face that would have been more fitting on one of his late show appearances .\nNow , CNN says they invited President Obama to this live \u201c town hall \u201d on guns at George Mason University and that they later invited the NRA . The NRA , however , said they \u2019 d rather not play along with a \u201c public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House . \u201d\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) , the trade association for firearms manufacturers , also declined an invitation . Larry Keane , senior vice president and general counsel to the NSSF , told me , \u201c We declined the invitation because it is a White House-orchestrated made-for-TV event and not an opportunity for a genuine dialogue or an effort to find common ground . We remain disappointed that the president has chosen to demagogue the issue for political purposes instead of providing real leadership like working to advance Rep. Tim Murphy \u2019 s bipartisan legislation to address the issue of mental health , which is the common denominator in mass shootings . \u201d\nGiven Obama \u2019 s\u2014and CNN \u2019 s\u2014attacks on the NRA and gun manufacturers in general , it is hard to blame them for passing on the invitation , but in retrospect Cooper might have made them wish they were there to help keep President Obama squirming .\nAs squirm he did\u2014with the facts and in his seat .\nTaya Kyle , the wife of the late \u201c American Sniper \u201d Chris Kyle , was the first person Cooper called on .
