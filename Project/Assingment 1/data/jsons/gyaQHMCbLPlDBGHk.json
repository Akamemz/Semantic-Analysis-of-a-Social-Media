This story was co-published with the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Magazine .\nPONTIAC , Mich. \u2014 One afternoon in mid-June , Charisse * drove up to the checkpoint at the Children \u2019 s Village juvenile detention center in suburban Detroit , desperate to be near her daughter . It had been a month since she had last seen her , when a judge found the girl had violated probation and sent her to the facility during the pandemic .\nThe girl , Grace , hadn \u2019 t broken the law again . The 15-year-old wasn \u2019 t in trouble for fighting with her mother or stealing , the issues that had gotten her placed on probation in the first place .\nShe was incarcerated in May for violating her probation by not completing her online coursework when her school in Beverly Hills switched to remote learning .\nBecause of the confidentiality of juvenile court cases , it \u2019 s impossible to determine how unusual Grace \u2019 s situation is . But attorneys and advocates in Michigan and elsewhere say they are unaware of any other case involving the detention of a child for failing to meet academic requirements after schools closed to help stop the spread of COVID-19 .\nThe decision , they say , flies in the face of recommendations from the legal and education communities that have urged leniency and a prioritization of children \u2019 s health and safety amid the crisis . The case may also reflect , some experts and Grace \u2019 s mother believe , systemic racial bias . Grace is Black in a predominantly white community and in a county where a disproportionate percentage of Black youth are involved with the juvenile justice system .\nAcross the country , teachers , parents and students have struggled with the upheaval caused by monthslong school closures . School districts have documented tens of thousands of students who failed to log in or complete their schoolwork : 15,000 high school students in Los Angeles , one-third of the students in Minneapolis Public Schools and about a quarter of Chicago Public Schools students .\nStudents with special needs are especially vulnerable without the face-to-face guidance from teachers , social workers and others . Grace , who has ADHD , said she felt unmotivated and overwhelmed when online learning began April 15 , about a month after schools closed . Without much live instruction or structure , she got easily distracted and had difficulty keeping herself on track , she said .\n\u201c Who can even be a good student right now ? \u201d said Ricky Watson Jr. , executive director of the National Juvenile Justice Network . \u201c Unless there is an urgent need , I don \u2019 t understand why you would be sending a kid to any facility right now and taking them away from their families with all that we are dealing with right now . \u201d\nIn many places , juvenile courts have attempted to keep children out of detention except in the most serious cases , and they have worked to release those who were already there , experts say . A survey of juvenile justice agencies in 30 states found that the number of youths in secure detention fell by 24 % in March , largely due to a steep decline in placements .\nIn Michigan , Gov . Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order in March that temporarily suspended the confinement of juveniles who violate probation unless directed by a court order and encouraged eliminating any form of detention or residential placement unless a young person posed a \u201c substantial and immediate safety risk to others. \u201d Acting on Whitmer \u2019 s order , which was extended until late May , the Michigan Supreme Court told juvenile court judges to determine which juveniles could be returned home .\nJudge Mary Ellen Brennan , the presiding judge of the Oakland County Family Court Division , declined through a court administrator to comment on Grace \u2019 s case . In her ruling , she found Grace \u201c guilty on failure to submit to any schoolwork and getting up for school \u201d and called Grace a \u201c threat to ( the ) community , \u201d citing the assault and theft charges that led to her probation .\n\u201c She hasn \u2019 t fulfilled the expectation with regard to school performance , \u201d Brennan said as she sentenced Grace . \u201c I told her she was on thin ice and I told her that I was going to hold her to the letter , to the order , of the probation . \u201d\nThat June afternoon , a month after the sentencing , Charisse left Children \u2019 s Village without seeing Grace , but she did pick up a shopping bag of clothes and toiletries she had delivered days earlier . She said officials had rejected them because they violated facility rules : underwear that wasn \u2019 t briefs ; face wipes that contained alcohol ; a pair of jeans deemed too tight .\nCharisse counts each day they \u2019 re apart , and that was day No . 33 . Another month has since passed , and there could still be months to go before they are at home together again .\nDriving home , Charisse had to pull over soon after she turned onto the road leading away from the complex . She sat in a parking lot , sobbing .\n\u201c It just doesn \u2019 t make any sense , \u201d she said . She shook her head as tears dampened the disposable blue face mask pulled down to her chin .\n\u201c Every day I go to bed thinking , and wake up thinking , \u2018 How is this a better situation for her ? \u2019 \u201d\nIt has always been just the two of them , Charisse and Grace .\nTold by doctors that she would be unable to have children , Charisse , a consultant to nonprofit organizations , was shocked when she became pregnant at 44 . She has raised Grace on her own after the girl \u2019 s father did not want to be involved , she said .\nThey did everything together : winter sports throughout Michigan , rounds of golf , going to the opera , singing to Tony Bennett on road trips . They even appeared in a \u201c Pure Michigan \u201d tourism ad . As a child , Grace wanted so much to be like her mother that she asked to be called Charisse No . 2 .\nWhen Grace hit her preteen years , however , their relationship became rocky . They argued about Grace keeping her room clean and doing schoolwork and regularly battled over her use of the phone , social media and other technology .\nBy the time Grace turned 13 , the arguments had escalated to the point that Charisse turned to the police for help several times when Grace yelled at or pushed her . She said she didn \u2019 t know about other social services to call instead . In one incident , they argued over Grace taking her mother \u2019 s iPhone charger ; when police arrived , they discovered she had taken an iPad from her middle school without permission . At her mother \u2019 s request , Grace entered a court diversion program in 2018 for \u201c incorrigibility \u201d and agreed to participate in counseling and not use electronic devices . She was released from the program early , her mother said .\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nWhile there was periodic family conflict , Grace has always had strong friendships and is active in her school and community , her mother said . She has helped run programs at church , played saxophone in the school band and composed music , and regularly participated in service projects .\nThe incident that led to her current situation happened Nov. 6 , when someone called the police after hearing Charisse crying \u201c Help me ! \u201d and honking her car \u2019 s horn . Grace , upset she couldn \u2019 t go to a friend \u2019 s house , had reached inside the car to try to get her mother \u2019 s phone and had bitten her mother \u2019 s finger and pulled her hair , according to the police report .\nPolice released Grace to a family friend to let the two cool down and referred the case to Oakland County court , where an assault charge was filed against her .\nWeeks later , she picked up another charge , for larceny , after she was caught on surveillance video stealing another student \u2019 s cellphone from a school locker room .\n\u201c After I was caught , I felt instant remorse and guilt . I wanted to take back everything I had done , \u201d Grace wrote in a statement to police . She said she had questioned herself even as she took the phone but wanted one after her mother took hers away .\nThe other student \u2019 s mother , who declined to comment for this story , told police she wanted to press charges , although the phone had been returned to her son soon after Grace took it . \u201c My sincere hope is that any punitive action taken in this case be grounded in the goal of providing this student with opportunities for growth , change and future success , \u201d she wrote in a statement to police .\nIn the months following the two incidents , Grace and her mother participated in individual and family therapy and Grace stayed out of trouble .\nCharisse told a court caseworker assigned to the case that other than being irritable and getting \u201c cabin fever \u201d from being shut at home during the pandemic , \u201c nothing significant \u201d had taken place between the mother and daughter . There was no police contact after the November incidents , records show .\nThe April 21 juvenile court hearing on the larceny and assault charges against Grace was conducted via Zoom since the courts had shut down , with everyone calling in from their homes . Grace connected from her bedroom , her mother from their living room .\nIt had the familiar awkwardness of many online meetings : dropped audio ; a dog barking in the background ; participants swivelling in their chairs ; the prosecutor losing his connection . ( This hearing and others in the case were recorded , and a \u2588\u2588\u2588 reporter watched them at the Oakland County courthouse last month . )\nAshley Bishop , a youth and family caseworker for the court , told the judge she thought Grace would be best served by getting mental health and anger management treatment in a residential facility . The prosecutor , Justin Chmielewski , said he agreed . Grace \u2019 s court-appointed attorney , Elliot Parnes , said little but asked that she be given probation because she had committed no new offenses and because of the risk of COVID-19 in congregate facilities .\nParnes and Bishop declined to comment for this story and Chmielewski did not respond to calls .\nThroughout the hearing , Grace took her glasses off to brush away tears and wiped her nose with her sleeve . She shook her head , which the judge later criticized as a sign of disagreement but which Grace told \u2588\u2588\u2588 signaled her disappointment in her past behavior . She raised her hand a couple times and asked , in a small voice , \u201c Can I just say something please ? \u201d\n\u201c My mom and I do get into a lot of arguments , but with each one I learn something and try to analyze why it happened , \u201d she said . \u201c My mom and I are working each day to better ourselves and our relationship , and I think that the removal from my home would be an intrusion on our progress . \u201d\nBrennan admonished Grace for the fights with her mother , her thefts at school and behaving in a way that required police to come to their home . \u201c Police , \u201d she said . \u201c Most people go through their entire youth without having the cops have to come to their house because they can \u2019 t get themselves together . \u201d\nBut , citing the pandemic , Brennan decided not to remove Grace from her home and instead sentenced her to \u201c intensive probation. \u201d The terms of the probation included a GPS tether , regular check-ins with a court caseworker , counseling , no phone and the use of the school laptop for educational purposes only . Grace also was required to do her schoolwork .\n\u201c I hope that she upholds her end of the bargain , \u201d Brennan said at the end of the hearing .\nSchools across the country weren \u2019 t prepared for the abrupt turn to remote learning . Grace \u2019 s school , Groves High School , in one of the most well-regarded districts in the state , was no different .\nIn mid-March , thinking the closures might last for only a month , the district initially offered optional online activities and then recessed for an already-scheduled weeklong spring break . Soon after , Whitmer announced that schools would end face-to-face instruction for the rest of the year . The Birmingham Public Schools superintendent asked families for patience as schools moved to an online curriculum in mid-April and promised flexibility in their support . Officials said student work would be evaluated as credit/no-credit .\nThe initial days of remote school coincided with the start of Grace \u2019 s probation . Charisse was concerned that her daughter , who was a high school sophomore and had nearly perfect attendance , would have trouble without in-person support from teachers . Grace gets distracted easily and abandons her work , symptoms of her ADHD and a mood disorder , records show . Her Individualized Education Plan , which spelled out the school supports she should receive , required teachers to periodically check in to make sure she was on task and clarify the material , and it allowed her extra time to complete assignments and tests . When remote learning began , she did not get those supports , her mother said .\nDays after the court hearing , on April 24 , Grace \u2019 s new caseworker , Rachel Giroux , made notes in her file that she was doing well : Grace had called to check in at 8:57 a.m. ; she reported no issues at home and was getting ready to log in to do her schoolwork .\nBut by the start of the following week , Grace told Giroux she felt overwhelmed . She had forgotten to plug in her computer and her alarm didn \u2019 t go off , so she overslept . She felt anxious about the probation requirements . Charisse , feeling overwhelmed as well , confided in the caseworker that Grace had been staying up late to make food and going on the internet , then sleeping in . She said she was setting up a schedule for Grace and putting a desk in the living room where she could watch her work .\n\u201c Worker told mother that child is not going to be perfect and that teenagers aren \u2019 t always easy to work with but you have to give them the opportunity to change , \u201d according to the case progress notes . \u201c Child needs time to adjust to this new normal of being on probation and doing work from home . \u201d\nFive days later , after calling Charisse and learning that Grace had fallen back to sleep after her morning caseworker check-in , Giroux filed a violation of probation against her for not doing her schoolwork .\nGiroux told the prosecutor she planned to ask the judge to detain Grace because she \u201c clearly doesn \u2019 t want to abide by the rules in the community , \u201d according to the case notes .\nGrace has said in court and in answers to questions from \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she was trying to do what was asked of her . She had checked in with her caseworker every day and complied with the other requirements of intensive probation , including staying at home and obeying all laws . She had told her special education teacher that she needed one-on-one help and began receiving daily tutoring the day after the probation violation was filed .\nGiroux filed the violation of probation before confirming whether Grace was meeting her academic requirements . She emailed Grace \u2019 s teacher three days later , asking , \u201c Is there a certain percentage of a class she is supposed to be completing a day/week ? \u201d\nGrace \u2019 s teacher , Katherine Tarpeh , responded in an email to Giroux that the teenager was \u201c not out of alignment with most of my other students . \u201d\n\u201c Let me be clear that this is no one \u2019 s fault because we did not see this unprecedented global pandemic coming , \u201d she wrote . Grace , she wrote , \u201c has a strong desire to do well. \u201d She \u201c is trying to get to the other side of a steep learning curve mountain and we have a plan for her to get there . \u201d\nGiroux declined to comment . Tarpeh told a reporter she was not allowed to discuss Grace \u2019 s case .\nThe May 14 hearing to decide whether Grace had violated her probation , and what would happen if she had , took place at the Oakland County courthouse when the Family Division was hearing only \u201c essential emergency matters . \u201d\nGrace \u2019 s case was the only one heard in person in the courthouse that day .\nOn May 14 , Judge Mary Ellen Brennan found that Grace was in violation of probation for not submitting schoolwork and ordered that she be detained at Children \u2019 s Village in Oakland County , Michigan . ( Records provided by Grace \u2019 s Family )\nGrace \u2019 s attorney , concerned about his health , participated by Zoom , though he told the judge it was difficult to represent her without being there . He told the judge he decided not to request a postponement because the family was worried she would detain Grace if they waited for a later court date .\nThe prosecution called Giroux , the caseworker , as its only witness . In response to questions from Grace \u2019 s attorney , she acknowledged she did not know what type of educational disabilities Grace had and did not answer a question about what accommodations those disabilities might require . Her assessment that Grace hadn \u2019 t done her schoolwork was based on a comment her mother made to her teacher , which Charisse testified she said in a moment of frustration and was untrue .\nGrace \u2019 s special education teacher , Tarpeh , could have provided more information and planned to testify but had to leave the hearing to teach a class , according to the prosecutor .\nGrace and her mother testified that she was handling her schoolwork more responsibly \u2014 and that she had permission to turn in her assignments at her own pace , as long as she finished by the end of the semester . And , Charisse said , Grace was behaving and not causing her any physical harm .\nThe transition to virtual school had been difficult , Grace testified , but she said she was making progress . \u201c I just needed time to adjust to the schedule that my mom had prepared for me , \u201d she said .\nBrennan was unconvinced . Grace \u2019 s probation , she told her , was \u201c zero tolerance , for lack of a better term . \u201d\nShe sent her to detention . Grace was taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs .\nFrom March 16 , when Michigan courts began limiting operations to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 , to June 29 , at least 24 delinquency cases involving youth in Oakland County court resulted in placements to juvenile facilities . Of those , more than half involved young people who are Black , like Grace .\nThose numbers , obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 from the Oakland County Circuit Court , reflect long-standing racial disparities in the state and county \u2019 s juvenile justice system . From January 2016 through June 2020 , about 4,800 juvenile cases were referred to the Oakland court . Of those , 42 % involved Black youth even though only about 15 % of the county \u2019 s youth are Black .\nA report released last month , which found inadequate legal representation for juveniles in Michigan , noted that research has shown a disproportionate number of youth of color are incarcerated in Michigan overall . Black youth in the state are incarcerated more than four times as often as their white peers , according to an analysis of federal government data by The Sentencing Project , a nonprofit that addresses racial disparities in the criminal justice system .\n\u201c It is clear that kids of color are disproportionately involved and impacted by the system across the board , \u201d said Jason Smith of the nonprofit Michigan Center for Youth Justice , which works to reduce the confinement of youth . \u201c They are more likely to be arrested , less likely to be offered any kind of diversion , more likely to be removed out of the home and placed in some sort of confinement situation . \u201d\nIn Grace \u2019 s case , too , she was sent to a facility at a time when the governor had encouraged courts to send children home .\nAt the county-run Children \u2019 s Village , which has space for 216 youth in secure and residential settings , the population was down to 80 last week , according to the facility manager . There have been no COVID-19 cases in the youth population and four workers have tested positive from contacts outside Children \u2019 s Village , she said .\nDuring March and April , 97 juveniles were released from Children \u2019 s Village by court order , said Pamela Monville , the Oakland County deputy court administrator . \u201c We understood the orders and the concerns to stop the spread , \u201d she said . Judges , caseworkers and attorneys worked together to determine \u201c who could go back to the community , \u201d she added .\nJuvenile justice experts and disability advocates decried the decision to remove Grace from her home , particularly when \u201c the state gave clear directives that children , and all people , unless it was a dire emergency , were to be kept out of detention , \u201d said Kristen Staley , co-director of the Midwest Juvenile Defender Center , which works to improve juvenile defense across eight states .\nTerri Gilbert , a former supervisor for juvenile justice programming in Michigan and a high-profile advocate , said the system suffers from inconsistencies in treatment and sentencing , aggravated by a lack of public information .\n\u201c This is too harsh of a sentence for a kid who didn \u2019 t do their homework . \u2026 There is so much research that points to the fact that this is not the right response for this crime , \u201d said Gilbert , a member of a governor-appointed committee that focuses on juvenile justice . \u201c Teenage girls act out . They get mouthy . They get into fights with her mothers . They don \u2019 t want to get up until noon . This is normal stuff . \u201d\nMonville said Brennan , a judge since 2008 , \u201c made the decision she made based on what she heard and her experience on the bench . \u201d\nBut officials at the Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service , the state disabilities watchdog organization , said they were especially troubled that a student with special needs \u2014 one of the most vulnerable populations \u2014 was punished when students and teachers everywhere couldn \u2019 t adjust to online learning .\n\u201c It is inconceivable that , given the utterly unprecedented situation , a court would enforce expectations about what student participation in school means that was not tied to the reality of education during a pandemic , \u201d said Kris Keranen , who oversees education for the group .\nCharisse says the \u201c greatest pain and devastation \u201d of her life was watching Grace handcuffed in the courtroom . She got a letter in the mail a few days later :\nIn the first letter to her mother while in detention , Grace wrote , \u201c I want to be a better person. \u201d ( Records provided by Grace \u2019 s Family )\n\u201c I want to change . I want to be a better person . Here I \u2019 ve realized how much you care and love me . I \u2019 m sorry I took that for granted . Please continue to send me pictures of me and you or just with anyone . I love you mommy and I miss you . \u201d\nOn Juneteenth , the day that commemorates the end of slavery , Charisse sat alone at her kitchen table , the wall behind her covered with Grace \u2019 s childhood artwork . As the country faced a reckoning over systemic racism , the day had taken on increased recognition and Charisse lamented she and Grace couldn \u2019 t mark it together as they usually did , attending programs at church or at the Museum of African American History in Detroit .\nCharisse made strawberry lemonade with fresh watermelon , a variation on the traditional red Juneteenth drink , and talked to Grace the only way she could , through a video call monitored by a Children \u2019 s Village case coordinator . The longest they had ever been separated before was when Grace attended a leadership sleepaway camp for six weeks over the summer .\n\u201c Juneteenth is all about freedom and you can \u2019 t even celebrate . What do you have ? It has been taken away , \u201d she said to her daughter .\nOther than three recent visits , they have seen each other only on screen , including during a court status hearing in early June . On that day , Charisse watched as Grace walked into a room at Children \u2019 s Village handcuffed and with her ankles shackled , her mother said .\n\u201c For us and our culture , that for me was the knife stuck in my stomach and turning , \u201d Charisse said . \u201c That is our history , being shackled . And she didn \u2019 t deserve that . \u201d\n\u201c I Can \u2019 t Breathe. \u201d It Happens at Schools , Too . Students in Illinois schools said \u201c I can \u2019 t breathe \u201d while being restrained at least 30 times over the time period we investigated , according to our analysis of the records . The practice of face-down restraint is still legal in Illinois .\nAt the hearing , both Grace and her mother pleaded with the judge to return her home . \u201c I will be respectful and obedient to my mom and all other people with authority , \u201d Grace said . \u201c I beg for your mercy to return me home to my mom and my responsibilities . \u201d\nThe judge , however , sided with the caseworker and prosecutor . They agreed that Grace should stay at the Children \u2019 s Village not as punishment , but to get treatment and services . She ordered her to remain there and set a hearing to review the case for Sept. 8 . By then , it will be a week into the new school year .\nOn Juneteenth , Charisse and Grace spoke for their full allotted 45 minutes . Grace wore a light blue polo shirt her mother had dropped off a few days earlier . Her hair was pushed back with a Lululemon headband .\nTheir conversation began with the mundane : Charisse reminded Grace to use her deodorant , and Grace said she needed to get her glasses fixed . But it landed , inevitably , at the frustration they both feel .\n\u201c I want you to write in your journal , \u201d Charisse told Grace . She urged her \u201c not to get too comfortable \u201d in detention . \u201c I want you to do what you are supposed to do , but I don \u2019 t want you to feel like this is your new norm . \u201d\nGrace \u2019 s initial weeks in detention were \u201c repetitive and depressing , \u201d she recently told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in response to written questions .\nGrace was required to stay in her locked room from 8:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. She couldn \u2019 t turn the lights on and off herself and she slept on a mattress on a concrete slab , she said . She passed the time by reading , drawing and watching some TV .\nThe local school district provided packets of material but no classes . She said that she has not yet worked with a teacher in person or online , and that she meets less regularly with a therapist at Children \u2019 s Village than she did at home .\nShe has since been transferred to a long-term treatment program at Children \u2019 s Village , where she has a bit more freedom . Still , she tells her mother , it \u2019 s difficult to think about what she \u2019 s missing . \u201c Everyone is moving past me now and I \u2019 m just here , \u201d she said during the Zoom call .\nA Children \u2019 s Village case coordinator , listening , tried to be encouraging . \u201c You are doing very well right now , \u201d she said . \u201c Whatever happens , it looks good . You are respectful , you are following the rules . \u201d\n\u201c You stay strong , too , \u201d her mother replied . \u201c I love you . \u201d",

This story was co-published with the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Magazine.\n\nPONTIAC, Mich. \u2014 One afternoon in mid-June, Charisse* drove up to the checkpoint at the Children\u2019s Village juvenile detention center in suburban Detroit, desperate to be near her daughter. It had been a month since she had last seen her, when a judge found the girl had violated probation and sent her to the facility during the pandemic.\n\nThe girl, Grace, hadn\u2019t broken the law again. The 15-year-old wasn\u2019t in trouble for fighting with her mother or stealing, the issues that had gotten her placed on probation in the first place.\n\nShe was incarcerated in May for violating her probation by not completing her online coursework when her school in Beverly Hills switched to remote learning.\n\nBecause of the confidentiality of juvenile court cases, it\u2019s impossible to determine how unusual Grace\u2019s situation is. But attorneys and advocates in Michigan and elsewhere say they are unaware of any other case involving the detention of a child for failing to meet academic requirements after schools closed to help stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe decision, they say, flies in the face of recommendations from the legal and education communities that have urged leniency and a prioritization of children\u2019s health and safety amid the crisis. The case may also reflect, some experts and Grace\u2019s mother believe, systemic racial bias. Grace is Black in a predominantly white community and in a county where a disproportionate percentage of Black youth are involved with the juvenile justice system.\n\nAcross the country, teachers, parents and students have struggled with the upheaval caused by monthslong school closures. School districts have documented tens of thousands of students who failed to log in or complete their schoolwork: 15,000 high school students in Los Angeles, one-third of the students in Minneapolis Public Schools and about a quarter of Chicago Public Schools students.\n\nStudents with special needs are especially vulnerable without the face-to-face guidance from teachers, social workers and others. Grace, who has ADHD, said she felt unmotivated and overwhelmed when online learning began April 15, about a month after schools closed. Without much live instruction or structure, she got easily distracted and had difficulty keeping herself on track, she said.\n\n\u201cWho can even be a good student right now?\u201d said Ricky Watson Jr., executive director of the National Juvenile Justice Network. \u201cUnless there is an urgent need, I don\u2019t understand why you would be sending a kid to any facility right now and taking them away from their families with all that we are dealing with right now.\u201d\n\nIn many places, juvenile courts have attempted to keep children out of detention except in the most serious cases, and they have worked to release those who were already there, experts say. A survey of juvenile justice agencies in 30 states found that the number of youths in secure detention fell by 24% in March, largely due to a steep decline in placements.\n\nIn Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order in March that temporarily suspended the confinement of juveniles who violate probation unless directed by a court order and encouraged eliminating any form of detention or residential placement unless a young person posed a \u201csubstantial and immediate safety risk to others.\u201d Acting on Whitmer\u2019s order, which was extended until late May, the Michigan Supreme Court told juvenile court judges to determine which juveniles could be returned home.\n\nJudge Mary Ellen Brennan, the presiding judge of the Oakland County Family Court Division, declined through a court administrator to comment on Grace\u2019s case. In her ruling, she found Grace \u201cguilty on failure to submit to any schoolwork and getting up for school\u201d and called Grace a \u201cthreat to (the) community,\u201d citing the assault and theft charges that led to her probation.\n\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t fulfilled the expectation with regard to school performance,\u201d Brennan said as she sentenced Grace. \u201cI told her she was on thin ice and I told her that I was going to hold her to the letter, to the order, of the probation.\u201d\n\nThat June afternoon, a month after the sentencing, Charisse left Children\u2019s Village without seeing Grace, but she did pick up a shopping bag of clothes and toiletries she had delivered days earlier. She said officials had rejected them because they violated facility rules: underwear that wasn\u2019t briefs; face wipes that contained alcohol; a pair of jeans deemed too tight.\n\nCharisse counts each day they\u2019re apart, and that was day No. 33. Another month has since passed, and there could still be months to go before they are at home together again.\n\nDriving home, Charisse had to pull over soon after she turned onto the road leading away from the complex. She sat in a parking lot, sobbing.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she said. She shook her head as tears dampened the disposable blue face mask pulled down to her chin.\n\n\u201cEvery day I go to bed thinking, and wake up thinking, \u2018How is this a better situation for her?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt has always been just the two of them, Charisse and Grace.\n\nTold by doctors that she would be unable to have children, Charisse, a consultant to nonprofit organizations, was shocked when she became pregnant at 44. She has raised Grace on her own after the girl\u2019s father did not want to be involved, she said.\n\nThey did everything together: winter sports throughout Michigan, rounds of golf, going to the opera, singing to Tony Bennett on road trips. They even appeared in a \u201cPure Michigan\u201d tourism ad. As a child, Grace wanted so much to be like her mother that she asked to be called Charisse No. 2.\n\nWhen Grace hit her preteen years, however, their relationship became rocky. They argued about Grace keeping her room clean and doing schoolwork and regularly battled over her use of the phone, social media and other technology.\n\nBy the time Grace turned 13, the arguments had escalated to the point that Charisse turned to the police for help several times when Grace yelled at or pushed her. She said she didn\u2019t know about other social services to call instead. In one incident, they argued over Grace taking her mother\u2019s iPhone charger; when police arrived, they discovered she had taken an iPad from her middle school without permission. At her mother\u2019s request, Grace entered a court diversion program in 2018 for \u201cincorrigibility\u201d and agreed to participate in counseling and not use electronic devices. She was released from the program early, her mother said.\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nWhile there was periodic family conflict, Grace has always had strong friendships and is active in her school and community, her mother said. She has helped run programs at church, played saxophone in the school band and composed music, and regularly participated in service projects.\n\nThe incident that led to her current situation happened Nov. 6, when someone called the police after hearing Charisse crying \u201cHelp me!\u201d and honking her car\u2019s horn. Grace, upset she couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s house, had reached inside the car to try to get her mother\u2019s phone and had bitten her mother\u2019s finger and pulled her hair, according to the police report.\n\nPolice released Grace to a family friend to let the two cool down and referred the case to Oakland County court, where an assault charge was filed against her.\n\nWeeks later, she picked up another charge, for larceny, after she was caught on surveillance video stealing another student\u2019s cellphone from a school locker room.\n\n\u201cAfter I was caught, I felt instant remorse and guilt. I wanted to take back everything I had done,\u201d Grace wrote in a statement to police. She said she had questioned herself even as she took the phone but wanted one after her mother took hers away.\n\nThe other student\u2019s mother, who declined to comment for this story, told police she wanted to press charges, although the phone had been returned to her son soon after Grace took it. \u201cMy sincere hope is that any punitive action taken in this case be grounded in the goal of providing this student with opportunities for growth, change and future success,\u201d she wrote in a statement to police.\n\nIn the months following the two incidents, Grace and her mother participated in individual and family therapy and Grace stayed out of trouble.\n\nCharisse told a court caseworker assigned to the case that other than being irritable and getting \u201ccabin fever\u201d from being shut at home during the pandemic, \u201cnothing significant\u201d had taken place between the mother and daughter. There was no police contact after the November incidents, records show.\n\nThe April 21 juvenile court hearing on the larceny and assault charges against Grace was conducted via Zoom since the courts had shut down, with everyone calling in from their homes. Grace connected from her bedroom, her mother from their living room.\n\nIt had the familiar awkwardness of many online meetings: dropped audio; a dog barking in the background; participants swivelling in their chairs; the prosecutor losing his connection. (This hearing and others in the case were recorded, and a ProPublica reporter watched them at the Oakland County courthouse last month.)\n\nAshley Bishop, a youth and family caseworker for the court, told the judge she thought Grace would be best served by getting mental health and anger management treatment in a residential facility. The prosecutor, Justin Chmielewski, said he agreed. Grace\u2019s court-appointed attorney, Elliot Parnes, said little but asked that she be given probation because she had committed no new offenses and because of the risk of COVID-19 in congregate facilities.\n\nParnes and Bishop declined to comment for this story and Chmielewski did not respond to calls.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Grace took her glasses off to brush away tears and wiped her nose with her sleeve. She shook her head, which the judge later criticized as a sign of disagreement but which Grace told ProPublica signaled her disappointment in her past behavior. She raised her hand a couple times and asked, in a small voice, \u201cCan I just say something please?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom and I do get into a lot of arguments, but with each one I learn something and try to analyze why it happened,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom and I are working each day to better ourselves and our relationship, and I think that the removal from my home would be an intrusion on our progress.\u201d\n\nBrennan admonished Grace for the fights with her mother, her thefts at school and behaving in a way that required police to come to their home. \u201cPolice,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people go through their entire youth without having the cops have to come to their house because they can\u2019t get themselves together.\u201d\n\nBut, citing the pandemic, Brennan decided not to remove Grace from her home and instead sentenced her to \u201cintensive probation.\u201d The terms of the probation included a GPS tether, regular check-ins with a court caseworker, counseling, no phone and the use of the school laptop for educational purposes only. Grace also was required to do her schoolwork.\n\n\u201cI hope that she upholds her end of the bargain,\u201d Brennan said at the end of the hearing.\n\nSchools across the country weren\u2019t prepared for the abrupt turn to remote learning. Grace\u2019s school, Groves High School, in one of the most well-regarded districts in the state, was no different.\n\nIn mid-March, thinking the closures might last for only a month, the district initially offered optional online activities and then recessed for an already-scheduled weeklong spring break. Soon after, Whitmer announced that schools would end face-to-face instruction for the rest of the year. The Birmingham Public Schools superintendent asked families for patience as schools moved to an online curriculum in mid-April and promised flexibility in their support. Officials said student work would be evaluated as credit/no-credit.\n\nThe initial days of remote school coincided with the start of Grace\u2019s probation. Charisse was concerned that her daughter, who was a high school sophomore and had nearly perfect attendance, would have trouble without in-person support from teachers. Grace gets distracted easily and abandons her work, symptoms of her ADHD and a mood disorder, records show. Her Individualized Education Plan, which spelled out the school supports she should receive, required teachers to periodically check in to make sure she was on task and clarify the material, and it allowed her extra time to complete assignments and tests. When remote learning began, she did not get those supports, her mother said.\n\nDays after the court hearing, on April 24, Grace\u2019s new caseworker, Rachel Giroux, made notes in her file that she was doing well: Grace had called to check in at 8:57 a.m.; she reported no issues at home and was getting ready to log in to do her schoolwork.\n\nBut by the start of the following week, Grace told Giroux she felt overwhelmed. She had forgotten to plug in her computer and her alarm didn\u2019t go off, so she overslept. She felt anxious about the probation requirements. Charisse, feeling overwhelmed as well, confided in the caseworker that Grace had been staying up late to make food and going on the internet, then sleeping in. She said she was setting up a schedule for Grace and putting a desk in the living room where she could watch her work.\n\n\u201cWorker told mother that child is not going to be perfect and that teenagers aren\u2019t always easy to work with but you have to give them the opportunity to change,\u201d according to the case progress notes. \u201cChild needs time to adjust to this new normal of being on probation and doing work from home.\u201d\n\nFive days later, after calling Charisse and learning that Grace had fallen back to sleep after her morning caseworker check-in, Giroux filed a violation of probation against her for not doing her schoolwork.\n\nGiroux told the prosecutor she planned to ask the judge to detain Grace because she \u201cclearly doesn\u2019t want to abide by the rules in the community,\u201d according to the case notes.\n\nGrace has said in court and in answers to questions from ProPublica that she was trying to do what was asked of her. She had checked in with her caseworker every day and complied with the other requirements of intensive probation, including staying at home and obeying all laws. She had told her special education teacher that she needed one-on-one help and began receiving daily tutoring the day after the probation violation was filed.\n\nGiroux filed the violation of probation before confirming whether Grace was meeting her academic requirements. She emailed Grace\u2019s teacher three days later, asking, \u201cIs there a certain percentage of a class she is supposed to be completing a day/week?\u201d\n\nGrace\u2019s teacher, Katherine Tarpeh, responded in an email to Giroux that the teenager was \u201cnot out of alignment with most of my other students.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be clear that this is no one\u2019s fault because we did not see this unprecedented global pandemic coming,\u201d she wrote. Grace, she wrote, \u201chas a strong desire to do well.\u201d She \u201cis trying to get to the other side of a steep learning curve mountain and we have a plan for her to get there.\u201d\n\nGiroux declined to comment. Tarpeh told a reporter she was not allowed to discuss Grace\u2019s case.\n\nThe May 14 hearing to decide whether Grace had violated her probation, and what would happen if she had, took place at the Oakland County courthouse when the Family Division was hearing only \u201cessential emergency matters.\u201d\n\nGrace\u2019s case was the only one heard in person in the courthouse that day.\n\nOn May 14, Judge Mary Ellen Brennan found that Grace was in violation of probation for not submitting schoolwork and ordered that she be detained at Children\u2019s Village in Oakland County, Michigan. (Records provided by Grace\u2019s Family)\n\nGrace\u2019s attorney, concerned about his health, participated by Zoom, though he told the judge it was difficult to represent her without being there. He told the judge he decided not to request a postponement because the family was worried she would detain Grace if they waited for a later court date.\n\nThe prosecution called Giroux, the caseworker, as its only witness. In response to questions from Grace\u2019s attorney, she acknowledged she did not know what type of educational disabilities Grace had and did not answer a question about what accommodations those disabilities might require. Her assessment that Grace hadn\u2019t done her schoolwork was based on a comment her mother made to her teacher, which Charisse testified she said in a moment of frustration and was untrue.\n\nGrace\u2019s special education teacher, Tarpeh, could have provided more information and planned to testify but had to leave the hearing to teach a class, according to the prosecutor.\n\nGrace and her mother testified that she was handling her schoolwork more responsibly \u2014 and that she had permission to turn in her assignments at her own pace, as long as she finished by the end of the semester. And, Charisse said, Grace was behaving and not causing her any physical harm.\n\nThe transition to virtual school had been difficult, Grace testified, but she said she was making progress. \u201cI just needed time to adjust to the schedule that my mom had prepared for me,\u201d she said.\n\nBrennan was unconvinced. Grace\u2019s probation, she told her, was \u201czero tolerance, for lack of a better term.\u201d\n\nShe sent her to detention. Grace was taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs.\n\nFrom March 16, when Michigan courts began limiting operations to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, to June 29, at least 24 delinquency cases involving youth in Oakland County court resulted in placements to juvenile facilities. Of those, more than half involved young people who are Black, like Grace.\n\nThose numbers, obtained by ProPublica from the Oakland County Circuit Court, reflect long-standing racial disparities in the state and county\u2019s juvenile justice system. From January 2016 through June 2020, about 4,800 juvenile cases were referred to the Oakland court. Of those, 42% involved Black youth even though only about 15% of the county\u2019s youth are Black.\n\nA report released last month, which found inadequate legal representation for juveniles in Michigan, noted that research has shown a disproportionate number of youth of color are incarcerated in Michigan overall. Black youth in the state are incarcerated more than four times as often as their white peers, according to an analysis of federal government data by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that addresses racial disparities in the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that kids of color are disproportionately involved and impacted by the system across the board,\u201d said Jason Smith of the nonprofit Michigan Center for Youth Justice, which works to reduce the confinement of youth. \u201cThey are more likely to be arrested, less likely to be offered any kind of diversion, more likely to be removed out of the home and placed in some sort of confinement situation.\u201d\n\nIn Grace\u2019s case, too, she was sent to a facility at a time when the governor had encouraged courts to send children home.\n\nAt the county-run Children\u2019s Village, which has space for 216 youth in secure and residential settings, the population was down to 80 last week, according to the facility manager. There have been no COVID-19 cases in the youth population and four workers have tested positive from contacts outside Children\u2019s Village, she said.\n\nDuring March and April, 97 juveniles were released from Children\u2019s Village by court order, said Pamela Monville, the Oakland County deputy court administrator. \u201cWe understood the orders and the concerns to stop the spread,\u201d she said. Judges, caseworkers and attorneys worked together to determine \u201cwho could go back to the community,\u201d she added.\n\nJuvenile justice experts and disability advocates decried the decision to remove Grace from her home, particularly when \u201cthe state gave clear directives that children, and all people, unless it was a dire emergency, were to be kept out of detention,\u201d said Kristen Staley, co-director of the Midwest Juvenile Defender Center, which works to improve juvenile defense across eight states.\n\nTerri Gilbert, a former supervisor for juvenile justice programming in Michigan and a high-profile advocate, said the system suffers from inconsistencies in treatment and sentencing, aggravated by a lack of public information.\n\n\u201cThis is too harsh of a sentence for a kid who didn\u2019t do their homework. \u2026 There is so much research that points to the fact that this is not the right response for this crime,\u201d said Gilbert, a member of a governor-appointed committee that focuses on juvenile justice. \u201cTeenage girls act out. They get mouthy. They get into fights with her mothers. They don\u2019t want to get up until noon. This is normal stuff.\u201d\n\nMonville said Brennan, a judge since 2008, \u201cmade the decision she made based on what she heard and her experience on the bench.\u201d\n\nBut officials at the Michigan Protection & Advocacy Service, the state disabilities watchdog organization, said they were especially troubled that a student with special needs \u2014 one of the most vulnerable populations \u2014 was punished when students and teachers everywhere couldn\u2019t adjust to online learning.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that, given the utterly unprecedented situation, a court would enforce expectations about what student participation in school means that was not tied to the reality of education during a pandemic,\u201d said Kris Keranen, who oversees education for the group.\n\nCharisse says the \u201cgreatest pain and devastation\u201d of her life was watching Grace handcuffed in the courtroom. She got a letter in the mail a few days later:\n\nIn the first letter to her mother while in detention, Grace wrote, \u201cI want to be a better person.\u201d (Records provided by Grace\u2019s Family)\n\n\u201cI want to change. I want to be a better person. Here I\u2019ve realized how much you care and love me. I\u2019m sorry I took that for granted. Please continue to send me pictures of me and you or just with anyone. I love you mommy and I miss you.\u201d\n\nOn Juneteenth, the day that commemorates the end of slavery, Charisse sat alone at her kitchen table, the wall behind her covered with Grace\u2019s childhood artwork. As the country faced a reckoning over systemic racism, the day had taken on increased recognition and Charisse lamented she and Grace couldn\u2019t mark it together as they usually did, attending programs at church or at the Museum of African American History in Detroit.\n\nCharisse made strawberry lemonade with fresh watermelon, a variation on the traditional red Juneteenth drink, and talked to Grace the only way she could, through a video call monitored by a Children\u2019s Village case coordinator. The longest they had ever been separated before was when Grace attended a leadership sleepaway camp for six weeks over the summer.\n\n\u201cJuneteenth is all about freedom and you can\u2019t even celebrate. What do you have? It has been taken away,\u201d she said to her daughter.\n\nOther than three recent visits, they have seen each other only on screen, including during a court status hearing in early June. On that day, Charisse watched as Grace walked into a room at Children\u2019s Village handcuffed and with her ankles shackled, her mother said.\n\n\u201cFor us and our culture, that for me was the knife stuck in my stomach and turning,\u201d Charisse said. \u201cThat is our history, being shackled. And she didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe.\u201d It Happens at Schools, Too. Students in Illinois schools said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d while being restrained at least 30 times over the time period we investigated, according to our analysis of the records. The practice of face-down restraint is still legal in Illinois.\n\nAt the hearing, both Grace and her mother pleaded with the judge to return her home. \u201cI will be respectful and obedient to my mom and all other people with authority,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI beg for your mercy to return me home to my mom and my responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe judge, however, sided with the caseworker and prosecutor. They agreed that Grace should stay at the Children\u2019s Village not as punishment, but to get treatment and services. She ordered her to remain there and set a hearing to review the case for Sept. 8. By then, it will be a week into the new school year.\n\nOn Juneteenth, Charisse and Grace spoke for their full allotted 45 minutes. Grace wore a light blue polo shirt her mother had dropped off a few days earlier. Her hair was pushed back with a Lululemon headband.\n\nTheir conversation began with the mundane: Charisse reminded Grace to use her deodorant, and Grace said she needed to get her glasses fixed. But it landed, inevitably, at the frustration they both feel.\n\n\u201cI want you to write in your journal,\u201d Charisse told Grace. She urged her \u201cnot to get too comfortable\u201d in detention. \u201cI want you to do what you are supposed to do, but I don\u2019t want you to feel like this is your new norm.\u201d\n\nGrace\u2019s initial weeks in detention were \u201crepetitive and depressing,\u201d she recently told ProPublica in response to written questions.\n\nGrace was required to stay in her locked room from 8:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. She couldn\u2019t turn the lights on and off herself and she slept on a mattress on a concrete slab, she said. She passed the time by reading, drawing and watching some TV.\n\nThe local school district provided packets of material but no classes. She said that she has not yet worked with a teacher in person or online, and that she meets less regularly with a therapist at Children\u2019s Village than she did at home.\n\nShe has since been transferred to a long-term treatment program at Children\u2019s Village, where she has a bit more freedom. Still, she tells her mother, it\u2019s difficult to think about what she\u2019s missing. \u201cEveryone is moving past me now and I\u2019m just here,\u201d she said during the Zoom call.\n\nA Children\u2019s Village case coordinator, listening, tried to be encouraging. \u201cYou are doing very well right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever happens, it looks good. You are respectful, you are following the rules.\u201d\n\nThen she told them their time was up.\n\n\u201cStay strong,\u201d Grace told her mom.\n\n\u201cYou stay strong, too,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d",
