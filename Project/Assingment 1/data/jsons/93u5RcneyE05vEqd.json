Oh , and of course , George Lucas .\nThink I \u2019 m kidding ? As Yoda would say , \u201c Kid , I do not. \u201d `` Star Wars '' ( that \u2019 d be `` Star Wars : Episode IV - A New Hope '' for those who grew up with Jar Jar Binks ) came out when I was 8 years old\u2014an age at which the brain seems at maximum absorbage power\u2014and from the instant I saw those yellow words scroll across the screen , my life changed . I learned something from that first movie and from those that followed . And even though the `` Star Wars '' franchise has changed hands now\u2014from Lucas to J.J. Abrams\u2014many of those lessons are still in play . For instance :\n1 . Friends are important . At first , this probably seems self-evident . Of course friendship is important . We see that importance throughout Lucas \u2019 original trilogy , wherein a handful of castoffs\u2014Luke without a family , Han without a home , Leia without even a planet she can call her own\u2014improbably find one another , and spend their free time hanging out and saving the galaxy . Dark Siders like the Emperor believe that friendship is a weakness : He tells Luke so directly . But , of course , Luke \u2019 s belief in his friends pays off in the end .\nBut the `` Star Wars '' movies also stress how important it is to make the right sort of friends . In `` Episode III - Revenge of the Sith , '' Anakin Skywalker gets pretty chummy with Chancellor Palpatine\u2014a bad move , really , all the way around .\n2 . Small folks can do big things . The Ewoks of Endor are the sentient plush toys of the `` Star Wars '' universe . This civilization of short , squat Pooh-bear beings is locked comfortably away in the Stone Age\u2014hardly a threat to the Galactic Empire building its new , improved Death Star somewhere above the moon \u2019 s verdant surface . But the Stormtroopers stationed in the forests below soon find out differently : Helped by a handful of intrepid rebels , the Ewoks take down a shield generator and save the galaxy .\nThis theme\u2014of the rich and powerful being taken down by the small and seemingly meek\u2014we see over and over again in the `` Star Wars '' movies , from the Gungans in `` Star Wars : Episode I - The Phantom Menace '' to , really , the whole scrappy rebellion . Even when we feel weak and insignificant , we \u2019 re able to do pretty amazing things .\n\u201c Size matters not , \u201d Yoda tells Luke in `` Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back . '' \u201c Look at me . Judge me by my size , do you ? And well you should not . \u201d\n3 . You got ta pick a side . In the evangelical subculture of which I \u2019 m a part , not everyone loves the `` Star Wars '' movies : Too much emphasis on this weird concept called the Force ( midi-chlorians aside ) , they say . And I get that . But as spiritually squishy as the Force may be , the concept allows the `` Star Wars '' movies to embrace a really important truth : There \u2019 s good and evil in this universe , and it \u2019 s defined by something beyond ourselves .\nWhen we see Luke and , in the prequels , Anakin , struggle between the light and dark side of the Force , their choice is not unlike the sorts of choices we face every day . We can choose , as Yoda tells Luke , the side of \u201c anger , fear , aggression. \u201d We can choose to cheat and lie , to look primarily to our own wants and desires . Or we can choose a better way . And the choices we make today will set the cadence to which we march tomorrow .\n4 . It \u2019 s never too late to do better . The prequels show how Anakin Skywalker succumbed to the Dark Side\u2014changing from a cute little kid into a remorseless , monstrous cyborg . And for me growing up , Darth Vader was pretty much synonymous with evil . Even Darth Vader himself might agree .\n\u201c I feel the conflict within you , \u201d Luke tells him . \u201c Let go of your hate . \u201d\n\u201c It is too late for me , son , \u201d Vader says , with a tinge of regret .\nBut as the movie goes on , we see that even Vader\u2014who spent most of his life doing terrible things for terrible reasons\u2014has a chance at redemption .\nThere are elements of that in `` The Force Awakens , '' too . Kylo Ren is Vader \u2019 s evil heir apparent . And he \u2019 d like nothing more than to follow in the Sith \u2019 s foul footsteps .
