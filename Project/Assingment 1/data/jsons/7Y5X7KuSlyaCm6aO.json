    "content": "The Senate passed legislation Wednesday that would make it less expensive for college students to borrow money to pay for classes , housing and books . But interest rates could soon start climbing .\nThe proposal , that passed by 81 votes to 18 , would link interest rates on federal student loans to the financial markets . That means student loans for the next few years would have lower interest rates . Higher rates would come in later years if the economy improves as expected .\nLiberal Democrats opposed the White House-backed proposal as a bait-and-switch measure that would lure in new borrowers . Republicans supported the measure and helped the bill win passage . The bill is similar to one the House has already passed .\nThe White House and its allies said the new loan structure would offer lower rates to 11 million borrowers right away and save the average undergraduate $ 1,500 in interest But there was no denying the new structure could cost future students if the economy improves as expected and interest rates climb . The White House 's allies instead suggested the new formula is better than the status quo .\nAfter the bill \u2019 s passage the White House released a statement from President Obama applauding the vote .\n\u201c This compromise is a major victory for our nation 's students , \u201d the statement read . \u201c It meets the key principles I laid out from the start : it locks in low rates next year , and it does n't overcharge students to pay down the deficit . I urge the House to pass this bill so that I can sign it into law right away , and I hope both parties build on this progress by taking even more steps to bring down soaring costs and keep a good education - a cornerstone of what it means to be middle class - within reach for working families . \u201d\nRates on subsidized Stafford loans doubled to 6.8 percent July 1 because Congress could not agree on a way to keep them at 3.4 percent .\nLiberal members of the Democratic caucus were vocal in their opposition over the potentially shifting rates included in the Senate measure , which passed with support from both parties . The bill passed with support from 45 Republicans , 35 Democrats and Sen. Angus King , the independent from Maine who helped negotiate the deal .\nSen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , joined 16 Democrats and Sen.
