Reporters outnumbered protesters at Caf\u00e9 Versailles in the city \u2019 s Little Havana neighborhood , long the go-to spot to hear heated talk about politics on the island 90 miles south of the continental US . As night set in , however , more protesters turned out , and news crews found irate Cuban-Americans who lambasted the White House 's move as a sop to the Castro regime .\nBut the Caf\u00e9 Versailles \u2019 demographic is just one segment of the Cuban-American community today .

It 's no longer Kennedy ; it 's no longer the '60s , '' says Fernando Miro , an office manager who was born in Miami to Cuban exiles and whose father , a former attorney in Cuba , was involved in the anti-Castro Bay of Pigs invasion and was held afterwards as a political prisoner by the Cuban government . He characterized the embargo as `` obsolete '' and unfair . `` I understand the idea , but it didn \u2019 t work .
