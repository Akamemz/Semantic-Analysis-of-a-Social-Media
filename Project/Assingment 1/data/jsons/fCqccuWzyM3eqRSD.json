''\nCamooso Miller also observed that college-educated voters probably prefer Clinton 's stability and predictability , regardless of whether they agree with her specific policy proposals .\nFrey agreed , arguing that the overall message of the GOP convention depicted an impending era of `` doom and gloom , '' targeting Americans who are suffering in the current economy ; but he said college-educated voters are more likely to see their jobs as part of a global economy .\nFrey also believes that for some college-educated voters ( who might traditionally vote Republican for economic reasons ) , the overall vision and identity of the country has become more pivotal to their vote than the economy .\n`` [ Trump 's candidacy ] has become not so much an intraparty battle as it has become a battle about what is America , '' said Diggles , explaining why we have seen a spate of recent defections of high-profile , highly educated Republicans .\nIf the polls are accurate , having a college education seems to be a key indicator of how white voters will cast their ballot on Election Day .\nUsing census data , NPR ranked all 50 states according to the share of the white ( non-Hispanic ) population , age 25+ , with a bachelor 's degree or higher .\nThis helps understand which states may be at play this November and why .\nFor example , there are a few states on polar opposite ends of the education spectrum :\nColorado has the highest percentage of white , college-educated voters in the country ( 43.42 ) .
