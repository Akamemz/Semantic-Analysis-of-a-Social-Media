    "content": "West Valley , Utah ( CNN ) Mitt Romney did not win the Utah Republican Party 's nomination on Saturday , meaning he must compete in a June primary election as he seeks to replace retiring US Sen. Orrin Hatch .\nAfter a wild and raucous day of voting at the Utah GOP convention , the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee was unable to win the 60 % that he needed to head to the November ballot unopposed . When none of the 12 candidates were able to cross that threshold , the party continued with successive rounds of caucus voting until one candidate reached 40 % .\nOn the second round of voting , Utah state representative Mike Kennedy emerged in the lead with 50.88 % . Romney came in a close second with 49.12 % .\nRomney and Kennedy will now compete in a primary set for June 26 .\nAfter the vote , Romney said he was looking forward to a primary race .\n`` This is terrific for the people of Utah , and I really want to thank the delegates who stayed so late to give me the kind of boost that I got here today , '' Romney said , standing on the convention floor after the proceedings were adjourned . `` We 're going to have a good primary . ''\nKennedy , who had framed the race as David vs. Goliath , said when asked why he had edged out Romney in the vote that he was n't sure .\n`` I do n't know , '' Kennedy said when asked why he thought his message appealed more to delegates than Romney 's . `` I do n't know -- it 's just my message . ''\n`` We 've got 60 days to reach out to as many voters as we can . ''\nRomney is considered a favorite to win the seat . He is widely admired in this heavily Republican state , where he helped rescue the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games . But when he decided to seek Hatch 's seat , he landed in the middle of a long-running fight within the Utah Republican Party over its process for choosing its nominees .\nSome Utah delegates and grassroots activists here have fought strenuously to maintain control over the process by keeping the party 's complex nominating caucuses , instead of allowing candidates to secure a spot on the ballot by gathering signatures .\nAfter the protracted legal fight , the legislature reached a compromise that created a two-option process to get to the ballot : Candidates could either gather the requisite 27,000 signatures or participate in the GOP caucuses .\nRomney sought to straddle the divide by doing both , engaging delegates in all of Utah 's counties . He has put 9,000 miles on his 2002 Chevy truck visiting elected officials and delegates all over the state to answer their questions and persuade them to support him .\nBut some delegates still resent the fact that Romney collected signatures , a process they feel favors deep-pocketed candidates over lesser-known contenders .\nRomney demurred when asked after the vote whether he felt that he 'd been punished by delegates who were angry that he had gathered signatures .\n`` I know there were many people who were not enthusiastic that we gathered signatures , but that 's something I did ; I 'm proud of the fact that we did , and I now have 52,000 people who signed up to support me , '' he said , referring to the final tally of signatures that his campaign submitted to the lieutenant governor 's office .\nRomney made his case to the delegates in a timed , five-minute speech Saturday night \u2014 taking his turn eighth among the 12 candidates running for US Senate after a random drawing . ( The field included a candidate named Abe Lincoln -- who literally campaigned around the state at the convention dressed up as Abraham Lincoln . )\n`` I 'm not Goliath , Washington DC is Goliath , '' Romney said , introducing himself to the 4,000 delegates as a `` neighbor , '' a person of faith , and someone who helped rescue the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games .\nKennedy , who also is a physician and an attorney , also invoked David and Goliath in his nominating speech .\n`` I started with David and Goliath , but not for the reason you might think , '' he said , alluding to Romney . `` In this battle you are David , firm in your fight for liberty . Goliath is Washington DC -- intimidating but beatable . And I , I am your stone ready to be flung at the foes of liberty who seek to oppress us , '' he said , to cheers . `` Working together we will defeat the Goliaths in Washington and restore our government where it belongs . ''\nRomney took some heat for being a latecomer to Utah and the former governor of a blue state . Earlier , another Romney rival , Jeremy Friedbaum , pulled out a carpetbag as a prop on stage to protest the fact that Romney moved to Utah more recently than some of the other candidates . ( Ultimately Friedbaum was booed off the stage and ended up with three votes ) .\nRomney also spoke against federal overreach , particularly on federal lands , and said he would represent `` Utah values '' in Washington .\n`` It 's time to restore the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution , '' he said .\nIn an interview at the convention , Lt. Gov . Spencer Cox noted that Utah Gov . Gary Herbert lost the party 's nomination two years ago because of the same anger roiling among the delegates .\n`` We lost by 10 points at convention , it was 55-45 , and then we won by 44 points in the primary , '' said Cox , who was on the ticket with Herbert . `` Sometimes the 4,000 delegates that are here are n't exactly representative of the 650,000 Republicans that are in this state .
