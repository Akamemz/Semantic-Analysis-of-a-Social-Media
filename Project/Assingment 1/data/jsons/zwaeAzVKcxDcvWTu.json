    "content": "Thanks to George Washington , Barack Obama can not seek a third term , but the president confidently proclaimed this week that he believes he could secure another four years in the White House \u2014 a boast some analysts quickly cast as wholly unrealistic , perhaps even politically delusional .\nWith Mr. Obama looking tired as he limps to the end of his second term , sapped of momentum by a growing string of foreign policy challenges abroad and largely paralyzed by political gridlock at home , analysts say another national election victory would be a long shot at best as the broad coalition of voters who reliably supported him in 2008 and 2012 steadily frays .\n\u201c It would be very difficult for Barack Obama to win a third term . He lost independents a long time ago . What \u2019 s keeping him afloat is essentially the Democratic base . The Democrats would certainly rally around him , and he would have that support , but we shouldn \u2019 t forget he lost 5 million votes from 2008 to 2012 . I imagine if he ran again he might lose a couple million more , \u201d said Lara Brown , a political science professor at George Washington University . \u201c His record is even more controversial now than it was in 2012 . \u201d\nThe president made his third-term prediction in a \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d interview Sunday night when he said it was probably a good thing that he is constitutionally forbidden from serving beyond the eight-year maximum that was the custom until Franklin Delano Roosevelt won four terms , prompting the 22nd Amendment .\nMr. Obama believes voters would re-elect him if given the chance .\n\u201c I do , \u201d the president said , though he went on to explain why he could , but shouldn \u2019 t , remain commander in chief through 2020 .\n\u201c On the one hand , I am very proud of what we \u2019 ve accomplished and it makes me think , I \u2019 d love to do some more . But by the time I \u2019 m finished , I think it will be time for me to go . Because there \u2019 s a reason why we considered George Washington one of our greatest presidents , \u201d he said . \u201c He set a precedent , saying that when you occupy this seat , it is an extraordinary privilege , but the way our democracy is designed , no one person is indispensable . \u201d\nThe comparison to Washington underscores how highly the president regards his own record , which he is increasingly highlighting as the end of his term nears .\nIn recent months , he has started bragging more about the state of the country \u2019 s economy , the progress of his health care law and other achievements .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of self-confidence that led him to deliver his 2008 nomination acceptance speech from a Denver football stadium amid Greek columns , and to proclaim himself the embodiment of hope . Republicans , in turn , mocked him by juxtaposing him with scenes of Moses parting the waters in the \u201c Ten Commandments . \u201d\nBut those heady days are gone , and Mr. Obama \u2019 s approval ratings have dropped from stratospheric levels at the beginning of his administration to mediocre in 2012 , to struggling now .\nThat is particularly striking among independents , a key voting constituency .\nJust after taking office in 2009 , Mr. Obama had a 62 percent approval rating among independents , according to Gallup data . After winning re-election in November 2012 , he had 50 percent approval among independents . But just 43 percent of independents approve of the president \u2019 s job performance now , according to the most recent Gallup survey .\nBeyond those damning numbers \u2014 likely fatal to a third Obama campaign \u2014 analysts point to other problems .\nThey say foreign missteps , such as the deteriorating situation and the muddy U.S. policy in Syria , could present insurmountable hurdles , along with basic voter fatigue .\nPerhaps even more damaging to Mr. Obama \u2019 s third-term theory is that the Democratic coalition he forged in 2008 may be disillusioned with the administration after a lack of progress on , among other things , income inequality , said Brandon Rottinghaus , a political science professor at the University of Houston who has written on presidential leadership .\n\u201c Most presidential administrations wear out their welcome with the American people after eight years , making it a tough sell , short of a serious crisis , to continue an administration beyond that proscribed by the Constitution , \u201d he said . \u201c For President Obama , three factors would prevent a third term : only modest economic growth , Republican disapproval of his term in office and low approval of the Democratic Party . President Obama \u2019 s popularity within the party is also questionable since there is a wing of the party that believes he didn \u2019 t go far enough on several progressive issues or solve some persistent problems which were ideological priorities . \u201d\nIndeed , Mr. Obama \u2019 s approval rating among Democrats was above 90 percent when he was re-elected in 2012 . Today , it is 82 percent , Gallup data show .\nOne explanation for the dip is that the Democratic Party , or at least a portion of it , has moved dramatically left , captivated by the progressive anti-Wall Street message delivered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat , and Sen. Bernard Sanders , a Vermont independent who is seeking the White House and riding a wave of liberal support as he nips at party front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2019 s heels in the polls .\nMr. Sanders made clear during Tuesday night \u2019 s presidential primary debate that he would take further action than Mr. Obama on income inequality and other economic issues and believes the Democratic Party must move to the left .\nOthers in the field believe Mr. Obama still has some electoral magic , at least among Democratic primary voters .\nMrs. Clinton , Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2008 opponent and then his secretary of state , split with him on trade but was overall complimentary of the president .
