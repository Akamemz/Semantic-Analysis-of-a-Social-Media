The fact that Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign chair , left-wing George Soros agent John Podesta , helped a Russian government-linked company bag $ 35 million \u2014 an actual , bigger scandal \u2014 is ignored .\nFirst of all , it is not clear what the Times story shows , because the Times spends so much time undermining its own case .\nPaul Manafort consulted for the Ukrainian ruling party , and helped it win elections . Manafort was listed in a handwritten ledger as having received money from that same party . The Times can not say if he received the money ; notes that Ukrainian investigators \u201c have yet to determine if he actually received the cash \u201d ; adds that \u201c the purpose of the payments is not clear \u201d ; reports that Manafort \u201c is not a target \u201d in a separate investigation into offshore dealings by the former regime ; and admits that it is \u201c unclear \u201d whether Manafort would have had to register with the U.S. government as a foreign agent .\nAll the Times has is what is already known about Manafort : namely , he advised an unsavory regime , and was paid handsomely for his services .\nIt is an unfortunate fact of political life that senior operatives on both sides have side gigs working as lobbyists , sometimes for foreign governments \u2014 and sometimes nasty ones .\nIn 2008 , Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) tried to cut lobbyists from his campaign staff to set an example ; then-Sen. Barack Obama ( D-IL ) ran on a \u201c no lobbyist \u201d pledge that he violated even before he took the oath of office . Even the left-leaning PolitiFact named the no-lobbyist pledge a \u201c broken promise \u201d by Obama . In 2015 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 broke the story that a former employee of a pro-Iran lobby group was advising the White House as the Iran deal was being negotiated , meaning that the ayatollahs had people on both sides of the table . The media largely shrugged .\nIt is certainly possible that Manafort was involved in corrupt dealings with the old Ukrainian regime . But the Times does not actually prove that . Instead , it throws enough innuendo into the article to associate Manafort with the old regime \u2019 s excesses \u2014 and to stoke the conspiracy theory of Russian control of Trump .\nKeep in mind that Trump \u2019 s opponent not only pushed the \u201c reset \u201d button with the Putin regime in an effort to establish closer ties , but also presided over a nuclear disarmament treaty that slashed America \u2019 s nuclear arsenal while leaving Russia \u2019 s weapons largely intact ; abandoned American missile defense programs in Europe to appease Russia , undercutting our Eastern European allies in the process ; allowed a Putin-controlled company to acquire 20 % of U.S. supplies of uranium , after a timely donation to the Clinton Foundation ; and encouraged American tech companies to invest in a Russian project that was likely used to improve Russian defense and espionage .\nThe fact that the media are obsessing about what is still , at this stage , a flimsy conspiracy theory about Russian ties to the Trump campaign , while largely ignoring the overt record of appeasement and explicit commercial ties between the Clinton campaign and the Putin regime , says more about media bias than it does about the business dealings of Paul Manafort .\nJoel B.
