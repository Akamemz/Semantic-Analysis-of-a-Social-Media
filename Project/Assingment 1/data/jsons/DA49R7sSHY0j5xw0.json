    "content": "On September 5 , 2006 , Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press , and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator . Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press .\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room . According to Chomsky , his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006 , until today when he played it for the Observer .\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant , such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut . But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton \u2019 s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is \u201c rigged . \u201d\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25 , 2006 , election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council ( the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority ) , Clinton weighed in about the result , which was a resounding victory for Hamas ( 74 seats ) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah ( 45 seats ) .\n\u201c I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories . I think that was a big mistake , \u201d said Sen. Clinton . \u201c And if we were going to push for an election , then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win . \u201d\nChomsky recalls being taken aback that \u201c anyone could support the idea\u2014offered by a national political leader , no less\u2014that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections . \u201d\nSome eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency .\nRegarding capturing combatants in war\u2014the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind\u2014Clinton can be heard on the tape saying , \u201c And then , when , you know , Hamas , you know , sent the terrorists , you know , through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured , you know , kidnapped the young Israeli soldier , you know , there \u2019 s a sense of like , one-upsmanship , and in these cultures of , you know , well , if they captured a soldier , we \u2019 ve got to capture a soldier . \u201d\nEquating Hamas , which to this day remains on the State Department \u2019 s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations , with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices , which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn . ( The paper \u2019 s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn . ) The use of the phrase \u201c these cultures \u201d is also a bit of a head-scratcher .\nAccording to Chomsky , Clinton was \u201c gracious , personable and pleasant throughout \u201d the interview , taking about an hour to speak to , in addition to himself , managing editor Jerry Greenwald , assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer , counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz .\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign\u2014speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms . Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia , for example , accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he \u2019 d \u201c get along \u201d with Putin .\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria , given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S. , Iran and Russia into confrontation .\n\u201c Do you think it \u2019 s worth talking to Syria\u2014both from the U.S. point [ of view ] and Israel \u2019 s point [ of view ] ? \u201d\nClinton replied , \u201c You know , I \u2019 m pretty much of the mind that I don \u2019 t see what it hurts to talk to people . As long as you \u2019 re not stupid and giving things away . I mean , we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years . They invaded Hungary , they invaded Czechoslovakia , they persecuted the Jews , they invaded Afghanistan , they destabilized governments , they put missiles 90 miles from our shores , we never stopped talking to them , \u201d an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016 .\nShortly after , she said , \u201c But if you say , \u2018 they \u2019 re evil , we \u2019 re good , [ and ] we \u2019 re never dealing with them , \u2019 I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them\u2026So I would like to talk to you [ the enemy ] because I want to know more about you . Because if I want to defeat you , I \u2019 ve got to know something more about you . I need different tools to use in my campaign against you .
