This mission is being advanced in a new way by states on opposite coasts , California and Maryland . The California Fair Political Practices Commission and the Maryland State Board of Elections , two independent state agencies that oversee campaign finance , recently approved first-in-the-nation rules permitting low-dollar text message contributions to political campaigns . Our agencies recognize that technological advances have opened the door for unparalleled involvement in public life .\nText-message political giving has the potential to transform the political process by democratizing fund-raising . Perhaps most important , it is one way to encourage grass-roots participation in political campaigns . People tend to have a greater sense of personal involvement in the issues in an election if they have made a contribution , even if it \u2019 s a small one . This connection can lead to increased civic engagement and ultimately a more robust democracy . Increased participation by many small contributors is also one way to counter the effect of big money in politics . Encouraging grass-roots giving is sorely needed in an election season where there is unlimited independent spending through \u201c super PACs . \u201d\nText donations have become a major , if not a required , tool to raise money and awareness . The fund-raising efforts for relief after the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan proved that such giving can make a difference . The ability to instantly text donations to relief agencies resulted not only in a groundswell of donations , but increased public awareness and concern for the devastating situation in those nations . Of the $ 255 million the Red Cross received for Haiti relief and recovery efforts in the month after the quake , more than $ 32 million was pledged when people texted \u201c Haiti \u201d to 90999 to donate $ 10 . At certain points , text donations came in at a rate of $ 200,000 per hour .\nWhen people give even a small amount of money , they pay more attention . They feel a personal connection . That connection results in more involvement in issues generally . More than half of the donors surveyed by the Pew Research Center \u2019 s Internet and American Life Project made text message contributions to other disaster relief efforts after their Haiti donation . And just under half of them encouraged their friends or family members to make similar contributions using their cellphones .\nAmericans have embraced mobile communications devices and use them for everything from voting for their favorite contestant on \u201c American Idol \u201d to buying a latte .

People would be able to be directly involved in these issues in an unprecedented way if they were able to text-message contributions .\nMany people in this country are disengaged from the political process . Trust in government is low and a large part of the population does not vote . Since 1980 , voter turnout in presidential election years has hovered between 50 to 57 percent . Yet recent grass-roots movements have had a profound effect on politics at the national level . In the 2008 presidential election , for example , the Obama campaign reported that 90 percent of its donors gave $ 100 or less and 41 percent gave $ 25 or less . In the 2010 midterm elections , Tea Party-endorsed candidates topped the list of grass-roots fund-raisers .\nPermitting text contributions will encourage participation in political processes by a new generation as well as by those who have been traditionally uninvolved .
