    "content": "In the end , President Obama was forced to listen to his generals \u2014 not his political instincts \u2014 on Afghanistan troop levels , and he decided to split the difference .\nMr. Obama is keeping 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond his presidency , about half the strength recommended by his top general in-country . It marks the sixth time he has rejected the advice of a ground commander on the force size in the long Iraq and Afghanistan wars . Military experts call that streak unprecedented for a commander in chief .\nLike the current 9,800 U.S. troops there , the drawdown force of 5,500 will maintain a noncombat stance in training Afghan forces and hunting al Qaeda terrorists , Mr. Obama said Thursday . Administration officials said the U.S. will spend about $ 14.6 billion a year to house the troops at a total of four bases in Kabul , Kandahar , Jalalabad and Bagram \u2014 an increase over the estimated $ 10 billion annual cost of keeping a force at the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital .\nThe president had wanted to deliver a speech saying that all American troops were out of Afghanistan at the end of next year , as he did in 2011 for the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq . But he was swayed by the dark picture of the Afghan conflict that the top brass has been drawing for him , and now Mr. Obama will pass the war onto the next president in 2017 .\nThe battlefield facts delivered to the White House by Army Gen. John Campbell , the top NATO commander in Afghanistan , and other generals :\n\u2022 The Taliban mounted a ferocious offensive in the 2015 \u201c fighting season \u201d that took a heavy casualty toll on the shaky Afghan National Security Forces .\n\u2022 Those forces still lack competent leaders to win decisive battles without American troops to guide them .\n\u2022 A new enemy has emerged , the ultraviolent Islamic State ( also known as ISIL or ISIS ) in a province next door to Kabul , the Afghan capital . This confronted the elected government with new security threats , especially the terrorist army \u2019 s trademark vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices .\n\u201c The security situation in Afghanistan is so far from stable that to pull out all the troops , even for this president , doesn \u2019 t make any sense , \u201d said retired Army Gen. John Keane , who devised the 2007 Iraq troop surge and has advised Afghan commanders in the past .\nMr. Keane , whose guidance is sought by Congress , said Gen. Campbell wanted to retain the current force of 9,800 , but Mr. Obama \u201c cut that in half . \u201d\n\u201c He still does not listen to his combat field general , who wanted the current force to remain as is , \u201d Mr. Keane said . \u201c Quite unprecedented , this is the sixth time President Obama has not listened to a field commander recommendation on force levels for troops in combat . \u201d\nThe six times : Mr. Obama rejected a recommendation from Army Gen. Lloyd Austin , chief of U.S. Central Command , to keep about 20,000 troops in Iraq ; at five transition points in Afghanistan , he approved troop numbers below those urged by commanders .\nStill , Mr. Obama did compromise on troops and infrastructure instead of ordering the complete withdrawal he had wanted .\n\u201c The goodness in this decision are the four bases , \u201d Mr. Keane said . \u201c If he had reduced it to one base , which they were thinking of doing , that would be a disaster .\n\u201c The four bases permits the military to conduct counterterrorism operations in the east , south and in vicinity of the capital , which is absolutely critical , one of the crucial capabilities we lost when we pulled all troops out of Iraq , \u201d he said . \u201c Also , the four bases permits the next president to expand the troop presence rapidly based on the security situation 15 months from now .\n\u201c What suffers as a result of this decision is the train-and-assist mission , because we won \u2019 t have sufficient troops to do it properly , \u201d the retired general said .\nTrain-and-assist is one of three major missions now carried out by American forces . The other two : advise and accompany Afghan forces on counterterrorism operations and provide force protection .\nOn Thursday , the administration defended the president against criticism that he ignored the advice of his top military advisers , with White House press secretary Josh Earnest saying that Mr. Obama \u2019 s decision is \u201c consistent with \u201d Gen. Campbell \u2019 s recommendation .\nIt is likely that Gen. Campbell \u2019 s communications with the White House in recent months mirrored the somber report he delivered Oct. 6 to the Senate Armed Services Committee .\nThere he spoke of a \u201c struggling \u201d Afghan force that faced its longest fighting season as the Taliban began early \u2014 in February . In the east , the Islamic State \u201c further complicated the theater landscape and potentially expanded the conflict , \u201d Gen.

Such air support \u201c is no longer the norm but the exception , \u201d he said .\nThe commander \u2019 s report card on the Afghan force : \u201c They must improve their intelligence fusion , command and control utilization of their forces . They don \u2019 t possess the necessary combat power and numbers to protect every part of the country . This makes it very difficult for the Afghan security forces to counter the Taliban \u2019 s ability to temporarily seize an objective and then blend back into the population . \u201d\nMarine Corps General Joseph Dunford , the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is now Mr. Obama \u2019 s chief military adviser .\nDuring his July confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Gen.

One could extrapolate from his answers to questions from committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , that he would attempt to talk the president out of that plan .\n\u201c Is this a wise decision on your part to have a calendar-based withdrawal of American troops rather than a condition-based withdrawal given your background and experience there ? \u201d Mr. McCain asked Gen.
