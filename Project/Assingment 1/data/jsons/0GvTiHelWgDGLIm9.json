''\nHouse Republicans plan to vote this month to extend for a year all of the Bush tax cuts , for middle- and upper-income people alike . Mr. Obama countered with an immediate , one-year extension except for the wealthiest taxpayers in the highest brackets . Their taxes would go back up to the levels of the Clinton administration .\nConceding that the ultimate resolution of what has already been a long debate over extension of the Bush-era tax cuts `` will be decided by the outcome of the next election , '' Mr. Obama said there was no reason to delay a temporary , partial extension .\nMr. Obama 's proposal , an approach that he has been pushing through two years of fiscal debate , is not likely to break the deadlock in Washington over how to deal with budget deficits , an impasse that has only hardened as Republicans sense a chance to make gains in Congress this fall .\nBut by calling for an extension for just a year , Mr. Obama hopes to make Republicans look obstructionist and unreasonable . Trying to bounce back from another weak jobs report on Friday , he also hopes to deepen the contrast with his challenger , Mitt Romney . On Friday , the president said Mr. Romney would \u201c give $ 5 trillion of new tax cuts on top of the Bush tax cuts , most of them going to the wealthiest Americans . \u201d\nFrom their stronghold in the House , Republicans plan to vote this week to repeal Mr. Obama \u2019 s health care law , hoping to energize their base even though they know that the campaign to abolish the law , which the Supreme Court upheld , stands no chance in the Democratic-led Senate . Republicans also renewed their call for an overhaul of the tax code .\n\u201c You know , what we ought to be doing is extend the current tax rates for another year with a hard requirement to get through comprehensive tax reform one more time , \u201d the Senate minority leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , said on Sunday on the CNN program \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nThe struggle to frame the tax debate comes as the campaign moves into a period , only four months before the election , when the perceptions of voters begin to harden . Polls show a persistently tight race , with Mr. Romney closing in on Mr. Obama in certain swing states but with neither candidate able to break out decisively . Control of Congress is also up for grabs , with Mr. McConnell saying on Sunday that he believed the Republicans had a 50-50 chance to regain control of the Senate .\nTo find a compromise with Republicans on which Bush tax cuts to extend , Ms. Pelosi , the House minority leader , and Mr. Schumer , a member of the Senate Finance Committee , favor making $ 1 million the cutoff . Above that level , Mr. Schumer has said , people are not likely to spend the savings from lower taxes and help the economy .\nAdministration officials said they did not believe that the difference between the White House and these Democratic leaders was a big obstacle . They said that whether to use $ 250,000 or $ 1 million as a cutoff was more a matter of strategy than a \u201c religious debate , \u201d in the words of one official , who added that many other Democrats favored $ 250,000 .\nThe White House hopes to squeeze maximum political mileage out of the White House event , surrounding Mr. Obama with families and workers who would benefit from the extension .
