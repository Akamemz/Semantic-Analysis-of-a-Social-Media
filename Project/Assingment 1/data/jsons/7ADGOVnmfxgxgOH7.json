The Senate passed a bill to fund the government.\n\nThe bill, known as a \"continuing resolution\", keeps the federal lights on through December. The bill already passed the House and is expected to be signed by President Obama, preventing a government shutdown. Most news coverage focused on provisions governing the US war against ISIS, but the fact that the bill passed the Senate and House without incident, and that the parties reached a deal to pass it without demanding concessions of each other, is pretty remarkable.\n\n2011, 2012, and 2013 were full of heated spending battles between the White House and House Republicans, resulting in a near-default in 2011 and a 16-day government shutdown last year. 2014 was hardly free of partisan acrimony but it was noticeably lacking in any high-stakes showdown.

Here are some key points to know.\n\n1) Paul Ryan and Patty Murray's deal held\n\nIn December 2013, Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-WA) and her House counterpart Paul Ryan (R-WI) worked out a deal to ease the spending caps (and thus the threatened automatic cuts) agreed to in the Budget Control Act (the law that ended the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis).

This is the spending law we're currently working with, and which expires at the end of the month.\n\n2) The continuing resolution continues the status quo\n\nThe bill approved by the Senate and House and headed to Obama's desk continues the levels of spending agreed upon in January. Indeed, it actually falls under the Budget Control Act's overall discretionary spending caps.\n\nThe problem is that there are separate caps for defense and non-defense spending. And while defense spending falls well under the agreed-upon cap, non-defense spending misses it by a little bit.

The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities' Richard Kogan estimates that the 2011 House appropriations process and the Budget Control Act resulted in a $1.915 trillion ten-year spending cut.
