    "content": "Co-host Mika Brzezinski abruptly ended an interview with author Michael Wolff on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe '' Thursday after an exchange about President Donald Trump and Nikki Haley , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , went awry .\nThe host questioned popular insinuations of a Trump-Haley affair , which were apparently sparked by the author 's controversial book , `` Fire and Fury : Inside the Trump White House . ''\nThe reports of a Trump-Haley affair stemmed from a notable passage in `` Fire and Fury , '' which stated : `` The president had been spending a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future . ''\nWolff , speaking to HBO talk show host Bill Maher last week , said that he believed the president was `` absolutely '' having an affair and indicated that he 'd left a trail of breadcrumbs in his book that would lead to Trump 's alleged mistress .\nHaley , the former Republican governor of South Carolina , later vehemently denied any insinuations that she 'd had an affair with the president , calling the reports `` disgusting . '' Haley added that assuming a woman slept her way to the top is a common tactic to smear women in powerful positions .\n`` I have literally been on Air Force One once and there were several people in the room when I was there , '' she explained during a podcast of Politico 's Women Rule .\n`` [ Wolff ] says that I \u2019 ve been talking a lot with the president in the Oval about my political future , '' Haley said . `` I \u2019 ve never talked once to the president about my future , and I am never alone with him . ''\nThe `` Morning Joe '' panel brought up Haley 's dismissal of claims that she had an affair with Trump .\nDuring the exchange , Brzezinski pointed to Wolff 's book , which she questioned for its credibility , and asked Wolff if he regretted `` inferring anything '' about Haley .\n`` I \u2019 m going to go as far as to say , you might be having a fun time playing a little game dancing around this , but you \u2019 re slurring a woman , '' Brzezinski told Wolff after he refused to commit to an answer . `` It \u2019 s disgraceful . ''\nWolff said Haley denied something she had n't been accused of and noted that he 'd never actually made such accusations , but Brzezinski , who was visibly agitated and put off by the conversation , brought the discussion to a sudden end .\n`` Come on , are you kidding ? '' Brzezinski responded . `` You \u2019 re on the set of 'Morning Joe ' \u2014 we don \u2019 t B.S . here .
