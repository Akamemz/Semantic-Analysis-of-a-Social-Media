Obama stumbles out of the gate\n\nNothing inspires Democrats like the Barack Obama swagger \u2014 the supreme self-confidence on stage, the self-certainty in private.\n\nSo nothing inspires more angst than when that same Obama stumbles, as he has leaving the gate in 2012.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s the unmistakable reality for Democrats since Obama officially launched his reelection campaign three weeks ago. Obama, not Mitt Romney, is the one with the muddled message \u2014 and the one who often comes across as baldly political. Obama, not Romney, is the one facing blowback from his own party on the central issue of the campaign so far \u2014 Romney\u2019s history with Bain Capital. And most remarkably, Obama, not Romney, is the one falling behind in fundraising.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP discovers Romney could win)\n\nTo top it off, Vice President Joe Biden has looked more like a distraction this month than the potent working-class weapon Obama needs him to be. National polls, which had shown Obama with a slight but steady lead over Romney through April, moved into a virtual tie this month \u2014 despite Romney\u2019s clumsy conclusion to the GOP race. Surely, all of this could prove to be ephemeral and meaningless in the arc of a long presidential contest. One Democratic consultant who often advises the campaign said that although Obama has spent a few weeks on the defensive, top Obama aides are unfazed. ( PHOTOS: Obama\u2019s top 20 jabs at the GOP) \u201cThese guys don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t turn into a circular firing squad, don\u2019t doubt their strategy,\u201d the consultant said.\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s impossible to overlook the early struggles of a White House and political team notorious for discipline and effectiveness. Consider the rocks that piled up in Obama\u2019s backpack this week as he and Romney moved into the opening phase of the general election campaign:\n\n* Romney has surprised his many critics with a clear and consistent focus on the economy, hands down the issue of the race.
