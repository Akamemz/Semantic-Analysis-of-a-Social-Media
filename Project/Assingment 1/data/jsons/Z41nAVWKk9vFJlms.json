    "content": "Starting in the '70s , the General Social Survey has periodically asked Americans if they think someone should have a right to give a racist speech in their community . John Sides has charted the responses over at The Washington Post , dividing the people surveyed into four groups : Americans aged 18 to 25 who have had at least some college education , Americans aged 18 to 25 with no college education , older Americans with at least some college education , and older Americans with no college education . The results are striking :\nThe first thing you 'll probably notice is that the percentage of the college-age crowd supporting the racist 's freedom of speech has decreased dramatically over those four decades . Another thing you 'll notice is that the college kids are n't leading the way so much as they 're converging with the non-college crew . But what really leaps out for me is when most of the drop happened . For the people who are actually on campus , the big plunge ended in the late '80s . Things then flattened for a while , sliding slightly but not severely in the 1990s ; the decline did n't accelerate again until the 21st century .\nThis flies in the face of folk memory , which tends to treat the '90s as the first age of political correctness . But it 's probably better to remember that period as a time of backlash against political correctness . That first big wave of `` P.C . Kids Gone Mad ! '' stories that hit the national press in 1990 was n't a sign that pro-censorship sentiments were taking off ; it was a sign that more people were resisting those sentiments . When there 's a backlash against some social force , many people assume that force is surging , just because they did n't really notice it before . That does n't mean it 's actually on the rise .\nBut that 's not all that happened in the '90s . Sides also charts the percentage of Americans in each group who support free speech for communists . Here the decline in the college crowd is n't as severe\u2014the share supporting the communist 's rights is well north of 50 percent\u2014but there 's still a noticeable drop at the beginning , followed by a flattening in the '90s and then a resumption in the post-9/11 era :\nSo the fall-off in campus tolerance for controversial speech does n't just affect the right .
