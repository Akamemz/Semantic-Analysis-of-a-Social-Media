Thad Cochran has been forced into a runoff with Tea Party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel , after neither candidate was able to win 50 percent of the vote and clinch an outright victory in Tuesday \u2019 s primary .\nWith most precincts reporting and an unknown number of mail-in and provisional ballots yet to be counted , unofficial results showed McDaniel , a state senator , with a slight lead over Cochran in the three-way race .\nResults from 99 percent of the state 's precincts showed McDaniel with 155,040 votes , or 49.5 percent . Cochran had 153,654 , or 49 percent . Real estate agent Tom Carey had 4,789 votes , or 1.5 percent , a sliver of support but enough to prevent either of the two better-funded rivals from reaching the needed 50 percent majority to avoid a runoff .\nThe runoff is set for June 24 , and the two Republicans will now enter a feverish three-week campaign . No incumbent has yet lost a Senate primary race this cycle .\nThe winner of the runoff will face Democrat Travis Childers and the Reform Party 's Shawn O'Hara in the Nov. 4 general election .\nThe Cochran and McDaniel campaigns entered Tuesday \u2019 s voting in a statistical dead-heat , traded leads throughout the night , then appeared to resign themselves early Wednesday morning to a runoff .\nThe 76-year-old Cochran is facing the toughest challenge of his political career . McDaniel spent Wednesday resting with his family and `` gearing up for what will hopefully be three more weeks of vigorous debate on the important issues facing Mississippians , '' said spokesman Noel Fritsch .\nCochran skipped votes in the Senate during the day . He and his allies sought to put the best face on a relatively weak showing at the ballot box after three decades in office spent directing federal funds to his economically distressed state .\n`` We had a great day yesterday , and it is one more step toward making November Mississippi 's moment when we take back the U.S. Senate , '' Cochran said in a written statement .\nAsked about the veteran senator \u2019 s prospects , fellow Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker paused at length but predicted Cochran 's victory in the runoff , saying he would give the party its best chance to `` hold the seat for a Republican majority . ''\nRepublicans need to win a net six seats to take control of the Senate .\nCarey said he had a preference between Cochran and McDaniel but declined to disclose it .\n`` The two candidates need to talk about issues instead of the backbiting and backstabbing that they 've done , '' he said , referring in part to four McDaniel supporters being charged in connection with photographing Cochran 's wife , who has dementia and lives in a nursing home .\nPolice say the four wanted to use the photo to advance allegations that Cochran was having an inappropriate relationship with a female staffer .\nThose who cast provisional votes because they didn \u2019 t have ID have five days to provide it and validate their votes .
