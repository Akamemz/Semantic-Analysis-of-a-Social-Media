    "content": "A meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un could be the diplomatic breakthrough of the century , but high-level U.S. sources , including two with experience in direct talks with Pyongyang , say huge doubts remain over the veracity of North Korea \u2019 s reported offer to discuss abandoning its nuclear arsenal and to halt all weapons tests while such discussions play out .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a great deal of uncertainty and skepticism right now , \u201d Joseph R. DeTrani , a former CIA official who served as special envoy to talks with Pyongyang before they broke down in 2009 , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Sunday .\nHe noted that , despite South Korean assurances that Mr. Kim made the offer in a private meeting with them last week , the North Korean leader has not commented on the matter publicly .\nWhile North Korea \u2019 s ambassador to the United Nations has reportedly confirmed the sincerity of Mr. Kim \u2019 s offer , four days have passed since Mr. Trump said he would accept a direct meeting with the North Korean leader and there has been no mention of the situation by officials in Pyongyang or by North Korea \u2019 s state-controlled Korean Central News Agency .\nIt \u2019 s a radio silence that prompted some uncomfortable moments over the weekend for administration officials defending Mr. Trump \u2019 s announcement that he believes a meeting could happen by the end of May .\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo was guarded Sunday when asked whether Pyongyang has responded to the president \u2019 s announcement privately \u2014 or whether there is any direct communication between the administration and the Kim government .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to get into the conversations that may or may not be taking place , \u201d Mr. Pompeo told CBS News .\n\u201c The president has indicated he is prepared to go have an initial discussion on this incredibly important topic , and we are preparing for that time , \u201d he said in comments that seemed aimed at tamping down concerns that the diplomatic momentum could be quickly derailed should Mr. Kim suddenly issue a statement contradicting South Korea \u2019 s claim about his willingness to discuss denuclearization with Mr. Trump .\nWith that as a backdrop , Mr. DeTrani told The Times that Washington is \u201c in uncharted waters with Kim Jong-un right now . \u201d\n\u201c There needs to be much greater clarity on what he means , \u201d the former envoy said . \u201c The South Korean delegation that met with him said the North Koreans indicated they \u2019 re prepared to talk denuclearization if they \u2019 re given certain security assurances . \u201d\n\u201c Well , what are they ? \u201d Mr. DeTrani said . \u201c Define it . Is it a peace treaty ? Is it ultimately dialogue toward normalization with the United States ? Is it the removal of American troops from South Korea ? What do you mean , Kim Jong-un , when you speak about \u2018 security assurances \u2019 ? \u201d\nMr. DeTrani made the comments after another former official with direct experience negotiating with Pyongyang sharply criticized Mr. Trump for racing into the idea of a face-to-face meeting without demanding a definitive statement from Pyongyang clarifying its position on denuclearization .\nAmbassador Christopher R. Hill , who served from 2005 into 2009 as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs when President George W. Bush \u2019 s diplomacy efforts with North Korea failed , warned Saturday that the administration has \u201c already made a major concession . \u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump has said he won \u2019 t meet Mr. Kim if the North Korean leader conducts any more missile tests , Mr. Hill said the president should have a much harder posture .\nA moratorium on testing is \u201c a nice thing , \u201d Mr. Hill told MSNBC , \u201c but when you send your president into a situation like this , you should be looking for something a lot more . You should be looking for North Korea to fulfill its obligation to denuclearize , an obligation it made in 2005 . \u201d\nMr. Hill made the assessment after the conservative-leaning National Review magazine published an editorial criticizing Mr. Trump on Friday for engaging in \u201c stunning improvisatory diplomacy \u201d toward the \u201c very bad idea \u201d of a direct meeting with Mr. Kim .\n\u201c What has Kim done to deserve this honor ? Over the last nine months or so , he murdered Otto Warmbier , threatened Guam and launched multiple missile tests , including two that flew over Japan , \u201d the editorial said .\nThe magazine added that the North Korean leader has offered only \u201c hazy assurances he is willing to discuss denuclearization \u201d in a move \u201c straight from the regime \u2019 s playbook \u201d of buying time to get sanctions relief , while \u201c continuing to pursue its core strategic goal of developing nuclear weapons . \u201d\nBut Mr. Trump said Saturday that he believes the overall North Korea issue \u201c is going very well , \u201d noting via Twitter that Pyongyang has not conducted a missile test since November and expressing optimism about the prospects of a direct meeting .\nOther administration officials asserted Sunday that Mr. Trump is completely clear-eyed about the situation .\n\u201c The president has been very clear in what the objective is here , and that is to get rid of nuclear weapons on the [ Korean ] Peninsula , \u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told NBC , adding that he finds it amusing that Mr. Trump \u201c has been criticized over the last year for being too aggressive . \u201d\n\u201c Now we have a situation where the president is using diplomacy , but we \u2019 re not removing the maximum pressure campaign . That \u2019 s the big difference here , \u201d Mr. Mnuchin said . \u201c The sanctions are staying on , the defense posture is staying the same as it is , so the president is going to sit down and see if he can cut a deal . \u201d\nDeputy White House spokesman Raj Shah told ABC on Sunday that the administration will impose no additional conditions on North Korea in order for the Trump-Kim meeting to occur , beyond stipulating that Pyongyang carry out no more missile or nuclear tests and refrain from publicly objecting to \u201c U.S.-South Korea planned military exercises . \u201d\nMr. Shah credited increased economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations , and pushed by Washington , with helping to bring the Kim regime to the brink of negotiations .\n\u201c Our policy is pressure , is pressure from our partners and allies around the world , pressure to the United Nations , pressure through China , these have had an impact , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s impacted Kim Jong-un \u2019 s behavior . It \u2019 s impacted his conduct . \u201d\nWhile many Republicans and some Democrats have openly credited Mr. Trump with success in ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang while keeping the door open for talks , administration critics and some members of Congress worry that Mr. Trump acted too impulsively in agreeing to meet with Mr. Kim .\nSen. Jeff Flake , Arizona Republican and a frequent Trump critic , told NBC on Sunday that \u201c the important thing is the diplomatic work that has to go in before such a meeting . \u201d\n\u201c A meeting like that would be kind of an afterthought after things are negotiated , \u201d said Mr. Flake . \u201c Here it looks as if , you know , that \u2019 s kind of the opening gambit , and that \u2019 s a little worrisome . \u201d\n\u201c This is a Hail Mary pass by Donald Trump , \u201d said Srinivasan Sitaraman , a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts , who went so far over the weekend as to argue that the president may be using the issue as a \u201c Wag the Dog \u201d tactic to divert media attention away from accusations relating to pornography star Stormy Daniels .\n\u201c Mr . Trump might very well play into the hands of the North Koreans , \u201d Mr. Sitaraman said . \u201c Trump is validating Kim Jong-un and providing a platform for him to be treated as an equal , something North Korea has sought all along . However , such validation is no guarantee that this will lead to reduced tensions in the peninsula or result in denuclearization . \u201d\nOthers say the impending resumption of joint U.S.-South Korean military drills , which were postponed during the Winter Olympics in South Korea last month , could be the first major tests to the durability of the diplomatic push .\nThe drills are traditionally held each year in April and always draw threatening criticism from Pyongyang .
