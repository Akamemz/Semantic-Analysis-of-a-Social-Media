    "content": "Rand Paul is a pol who can read his audience .\nStanding in front of more than 100 South Carolina GOP activists in West Columbia on Friday night , the Kentucky senator largely steered clear of the week 's two dominant , divisive issues that are tying his party in knots : gay rights and immigration reform .\nInstead , he diverted from his early-presidential-primary-state speech script and went for the jugular on a topic that , while not necessarily timely , would surely please a military-friendly crowd : a full-throated defense of profiling .\n\u201c After 9/11 we had a special program for student visas ... Why ? '' Paul asked . `` Because 16 of the 19 hijackers were overstaying their students visas . Was it targeting ? Was it profiling ? Yes . Because only certain people are attacking us . Why don \u2019 t we use some brain sense to go after the people who are attacking us ? ''\nThe guests ate it up , rewarding Paul with sustained thunderclaps . It was one of his biggest applause lines of the night . But it was also a curious statement from a likely 2016 White House contender who built his brand on a libertarian approach to government . This , from the same guy who stood on the Senate floor for 14 hours to protest the potential use of drones to target Americans ?\nYet the undertones of Paul 's full 23-minute speech to GOP activists at the state farmers ' market were unmistakable : rest assured , I 'm not my father .\nPaul is well aware of his dad 's reputation in the Palmetto State . Former Rep. Ron Paul barely competed in the 2012 primary here largely because his isolationist worldview was deemed a nonstarter in a place home to eight military bases . To be competitive here three years from now , Rand knows he needs to vanquish Ron 's long shadow .\nSo gone were Paul \u2019 s barbs about the IRS , his musings about diversifying the party , and his lengthy critique of the immigration bill that \u2019 s dominated Congress for the first half of the year . Even his standard line of attack against Hillary Clinton was subdued . Instead , in addition to endorsing targeted screening at airports , he earned audible accolades for his call to sever foreign aid to hostile countries and a forceful defense of Israel \u2019 s right to exist .\nThe address was almost exclusively devoted to foreign affairs and tactics employed in the country \u2019 s struggle against terrorism\u2014a marked change from his previous early-state primary speeches and a subtle acknowledgment that he must prove he \u2019 s no softy when it comes to national security .\nPaul \u2019 s top political aide , Doug Stafford , dismisses the idea that there was a concerted strategy driving this particular messaging . \u201c Quite sure either way was not deliberate . He has 40 minutes \u2019 worth of stuff to say at any given moment and hates speaking more than 20 , \u201d he tells me .\nIt 's not that Paul walked away from his core libertarian philosophy . He stood by his belief that even those charged with the most heinous , evil crimes\u2014like the Boston bombing\u2014deserve a day in court .\n\u201c You may not all agree on this , but it \u2019 s worth thinking about , \u201d Paul cautioned before explaining his rationale to halt indefinite detentions of possible terrorists .\nWhen he bravely posited his idea of a full audit of the Pentagon , he was met with complete silence . But he strived to emphasize that greater oversight of the military isn \u2019 t incongruent with support for troops on the ground .\n\u201c People say , you \u2019 re not going to go to South Carolina and talk about waste in the military , are you ? There \u2019 s waste everywhere . Anybody \u2019 s ever been in the military knows there \u2019 s waste . Doesn \u2019 t mean I \u2019 m against national defense .
