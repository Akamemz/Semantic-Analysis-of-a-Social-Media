The Ohio governor , who is closing in on the end of his second and final gubernatorial term , wrote a book critical of his former rival Donald Trump and the hyper-partisanship snarling Washington ; fortifying his foreign policy credentials with trips to Germany , Britain , and Japan ; actively inserted himself in the policy debates roiling Capitol Hill , most notably on health care ; and two of his longtime aides launched a nonprofit political organization to champion Kasich \u2019 s Two Paths narrative and highlight the bipartisan themes from his failed presidential campaign .
