    "content": "It \u2019 s safe to say Donald Trump hit a home run with conservatives upon naming Senator Jeff Sessions to be his administration \u2019 s Attorney General and Stephen Bannon for his senior advisor and co-right-hand-man along with chief of staff designee Reince Priebus .\nFrom what I can gather , most conservatives were willing to tolerate Priebus as long as the anti- Washington establishment Bannon was there to balance his presence with Trump in the White House . Fair enough .\nThen there was relatively positive feedback for Trump \u2019 s naming of teacher \u2019 s union busting school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education . Some conservatives weren \u2019 t overly enthused about Trump \u2019 s selection of South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley for U.N . Ambassador because of her tepid support for the Republican ticket during the campaign , but no one loudly objected .\nAnd all the rumors circulating around Mitt Romney and the Secretary of State \u2019 s post\u2026well , let \u2019 s just say we \u2019 ll wait until someone is named before the universe explodes on that one .\nBut Trump \u2019 s latest picks for the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury are leaving many conservatives aghast . On Wednesday , Trump \u2019 s team announced they \u2019 d decided on Wilbur Ross for the Commerce job and Steven Mnuchin to lead the Treasury department .\nIn reaction , Erick Erickson wrote at The Resurgent , \u201c Wilbur Ross is a Democrat . He worked with Bill Clinton . He has funded Democrats . He has been on the New York Democratic Committee . He is a Democrat filled with Democrat ideas . And Trump wants him to be Secretary of Commerce .\n\u201c Steven Mnuchin is a George Soros loving leftist who forced poor people into foreclosures that were unnecessary . He is as insider as you can get on Wall Street . \u201d\nNot quite content to stop there , Erickson continued , \u201c As much as Tom Price is a friend and good man , he has also been in Congress since 2002 and Elaine Chao , as much as she is a nightmare to union activists , is Mitch McConnell \u2019 s wife and a career cabinet member . \u201d\nPrice and Chao were named to Trump \u2019 s cabinet on Tuesday . Erickson \u2019 s reaction was typical of what I read about them , though there were a number of principled conservatives ( such as FRC \u2019 s Tony Perkins ) who praised Price especially .\nErickson \u2019 s basic beef is that with Trump \u2019 s latest moves , the \u201c swamp \u201d isn \u2019 t being drained , which is by implication a slap at the president-elect himself since it appears as though Trump \u2019 s breaking his campaign promise to completely scrub and sanitize the bilges of Washington . All throughout his presidential run Trump swore that Washington was going to be a changed place if he were elected\u2026and at least by appearance , it doesn \u2019 t seem to be happening .\nErickson makes a reasonable point , though as one of the leading and enduring members of # NeverTrump it \u2019 s hard to tell if he \u2019 s actually offering constructive criticism or whether he \u2019 s just trying to add emphasis to yet another claim of \u201c See , I told you Trump would be awful ! \u201d\nI think in the case of Trump \u2019 s cabinet , some perspective is in order . First , by naming people he views as the best person for each job , Trump is in essence keeping a campaign promise rather than breaking one .\nMany times during debates Trump talked about bringing people into government who know business and can sit across the table from world leaders and not be taken advantage of . If , in fact , Ross and Mnuchin truly are \u201c swamp creatures \u201d , at least they \u2019 ll know as much about the environment of the \u201c bog \u201d as the people they \u2019 re conversing with .\nThat \u2019 s not true when it comes to most politicians who \u2019 ve spent their entire careers swimming next to lobbyists in the malodorous oozing quagmire that is Washington .\nNext , though on the surface men like Ross and Mnuchin would appear to be the same types of \u201c swamp creatures \u201d that Trump swore he would cast out of his administration , they both come from successful professional backgrounds .\nAccording to Wikipedia , \u201c Wilbur Louis Ross , Jr. ( born November 28 , 1937 ) is an American investor , and former banker , known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel , coal , telecommunications , foreign investment and textiles . He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses . As of August 2014 , Forbes magazine lists Ross as one of the world 's billionaires with a net worth of $ 2.9 billion . \u201d\nAlso according to Wikipedia , \u201c Steven Terner Mnuchin ( born December 21 , 1962 ) is an American banker , film producer , and political fundraiser . He is a former partner for Goldman Sachs for 17 years where he accrued a net worth estimated at about $ 40 million . He then founded the motion picture firm , RatPac-Dune Entertainment . \u201d\nMnuchin and Ross have never been officeholders , just like Trump . Many of the criticisms being leveled at them are nearly identical to # NeverTrump \u2019 s contentions against Trump himself during the campaign . True , Trump claimed for years to be a Democrat and we all know he championed just about every Democrat cause under the sun for much of his life .\nTrump \u2019 s public lifestyle was also much more conducive to the \u201c anything goes \u201d mentality of the Democrats . Why do you think he fit in so well for so long with the New York and Hollywood elite ?\nIn fairness to Ross at least , he seems to have made a late in life conversion to the GOP having supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and then Trump from early on in this cycle .\nLike most Americans probably feel , it \u2019 s hard to form an opinion on the appointments of Ross and Mnuchin because they \u2019 re not well-known figures outside of the elite financial circles of the country . The fact that they appear to be \u201c swamp creatures \u201d is alarming , but at some point we have to accept Trump is going to bring onboard the people he trusts most to \u201c Make America Great Again . \u201d\nAnd the odds are Trump will get what he wants from the Senate in terms of confirmations , too .\nAnna Giaritelli of the Washington Examiner reports , \u201c Sen . Marco Rubio , R-Fl. , said on Tuesday evening he expects the Republican-led Senate to approve President-elect Trump 's Cabinet appointments , thanks to the low grade \u2018 nuclear option \u2019 Senate Democrats enabled three years ago when they controlled the upper chamber .\n\u201c \u2019 If you look at the nominations , they changed the rules . And now by 51 votes we can get anybody confirmed except for the Supreme Court and so that 's why I fully anticipate that by and large , unless it 's someone - something troubling comes out , you 're going to see the president-elect get his nominees , \u2019 the recently reelected senator told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening . \u201d\nIn essence , there \u2019 s not much anyone from either side of the ideological spectrum can do to stop these appointments . Unless there \u2019 s widespread Republican opposition ( and by widespread , I \u2019 m guessing more than four or five GOP senators ) , on virtually any nomination , Trump will get his way .\nThe prospect brings with it some apprehension , but at some point we have to allow Trump leeway to make the choices . We elected him to do just that .\nTeflon Rom meets with Trump on Tuesday night , still no word on Secretary of State\nSpeaking of trust \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 Mitt Romney emerged from his meeting with Donald Trump on Tuesday beaming from ear to ear and talking up his conversation with the president-elect .\nAnna Giaritelli of the Washington Examiner reports , \u201c Mitt Romney , one of President-elect Trump 's remaining candidates for secretary of state , called his Tuesday dinner with Trump and incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus \u2018 engaging \u2019 and \u2018 enlightening , \u2019 during an informal press conference following the meeting ...\n\u201c The 2012 Republican presidential nominee praised Trump 's professionalism in what may be an attempt by Romney to make up for comments on the campaign trail earlier this year bashing the billionaire businessman as a man whose leadership would trigger \u2018 trickle-down racism . \u2019 \u201d\nTherein lies the problem with the whole concept of having Romney serve a prominent role in the Trump administration . It \u2019 s not that Romney isn \u2019 t a decent man with an impressive life resume and a pleasant public demeanor . If you need a guy to trust with babysitting your kids , Mitt should be at the top of the list .\nBut should Romney receive the Secretary of State nod \u2013 or any cabinet post , really \u2013 how is he going to get past all the awful things he said about Trump during the campaign ?\nI think most people are willing to look beyond the sometimes vicious back-and-forth exchanges between Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio and Trump because they were campaign competitors and lofting bombs is something politicians do to set contrasts during the heat of battle . Let \u2019 s face it \u2013 most of the time politicians do a remarkable job of keeping their composure under tough circumstances\u2026but sometimes they say things they later regret .\nRomney , however , was offering those types of savage barbs about Trump and he wasn \u2019 t even in the race . He was resting comfortably behind a microphone somewhere proffering opinions on people who couldn \u2019 t strike back in any meaningful way . There \u2019 s no accountability there . Romney might as well have been a paid pundit on MSNBC for the things he was saying .\nPerhaps Mitt was stung by Trump \u2019 s claim that he didn \u2019 t try hard enough to win in 2012 , or maybe Romney was just trying to salvage his own political legacy , but by all-but saying Trump is a racist and a misogynist \u2013 those things are hard to take back .\nShould Romney end up in the Trump administration , those questions would dog him the entire time in office .\nFor what it \u2019 s worth , there are those who believe Romney looked uncomfortable during his meeting with Trump . A picture may be worth a thousand words , but the video of Romney \u2019 s post-meeting remarks betray a confident \u2013 and hopeful \u2013 man .\nLike with his other cabinet selections , until he proves otherwise , Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt . In meeting with Romney and other potential appointees , Trump is merely doing what we asked him to do \u2013 thoroughly vet his candidates . The coming days and weeks will reveal what he \u2019 s discovered .\nAway from his transition offices Donald Trump is planning something a little non-traditional for presidents in waiting . He \u2019 s about to embark on a \u201c tour \u201d of states he won , speaking in large venues to thank supporters for electing him .\nIn doing so , some observers are accusing him of waging a \u201c permanent campaign \u201d like Obama did after he won in 2008 .\nDavid M. Drucker of the Washington Examiner wrote , \u201c Some Republican insiders , however , are worried that Trump is inviting the same fate ( as Obama ) by acting politically so soon . Embarking on what is essentially a campaign swing , in states where Trump won , could make it difficult for Trump to unify the country and encourage Democrats in Congress to work with him .\n\u201c That 's especially the case , concerned Republicans say , given the partisan and occasionally controversial nature of Trump 's rallies , both in terms of his rhetoric and audience behavior . \u201d\nIf by \u201c audience behavior \u201d Drucker means violence , we all know ( thanks to James O \u2019 Keefe of Project Veritas ) that the incidents in several places were provoked by paid leftists intent on causing trouble .\nIf \u201c behavior \u201d includes the chants of \u201c lock her up ! \u201d that usually accompanied Trump \u2019 s prolonged restatements of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s crimes , it should be easy enough to control going forward . Now that Clinton has been vanquished and is only making headlines these days by joining in with fruitless recount missions , there \u2019 s no real need for Trump to talk about her anymore .\nInstead , Trump can and should tailor his remarks toward the future , highlighting the people he \u2019 s now putting in place to implement the policies that he promoted during his year and a half long campaign . Trump can demonstrate how he \u2019 s going to get rid of Obamacare and sanctuary cities . He can talk about the tax cut measures he \u2019 ll push . And he can explain his thoughts on foreign policy under a Trump administration .\nMost importantly , Trump can encourage supporters to stay informed and engaged .\nIf done properly Trump can keep people enthused for the tough work to come . He \u2019 ll need some support from Democrats but he otherwise has enough Republicans to pass the major initiatives .\nFar from the \u201c permanent campaign , \u201d Trump is merely keeping his populist army mobilized and peaceful .\nThen , unlike with Obama , there will be real hope and change .",
