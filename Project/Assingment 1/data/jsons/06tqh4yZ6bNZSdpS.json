    "content": "Speaking to reporters in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on a belated visit after two straight weekends golfing , Donald Trump offered by way of words of comfort the observation that \u201c I hate to tell you , Puerto Rico , but you 've thrown our budget a little out of whack . '' Earlier in the day , before departing from Washington , Trump remarked to the press pool that \u201c on a local level , they have to give us more help . \u201d\nOn Friday , though , Trump proclaimed the whole operation a huge success arguing that \u201c it \u2019 s been incredible the results that we \u2019 ve had with respect to loss of life . \u201d\nThe reality on the ground , as reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Eliza Barclay , is that the death toll hasn \u2019 t been updated in almost a week thanks to the breakdown of communications and basic government services . Many of us have wondered , for months , what would happen when the Trump administration finally had to face a real crisis caused by external events rather than a presidential temper tantrum or some bad tweets . And the answer is now apparent in across Puerto Rico where much of the population remains without access to clean drinking water .\nTo an extent , the United States of America held up surprisingly well from Inauguration Day until September 20 or so . The ongoing degradation of American civic institutions , at a minimum , did not have an immediate negative impact on the typical person \u2019 s life .\nBut the world is beginning to draw a straight line from the devastation in Puerto Rico to the White House . Trump \u2019 s instinct so far is to turn the island \u2019 s devastation into another front in culture war politics , a strategy that could help his own political career survive .\nThe rest of us will just have to pray for good luck .\nHurricanes Harvey and Irma were massive cable television events that dominated coverage on all the networks .

But something anyone in the media could tell you is that cable producers \u2019 news judgment is not an infallible guide to the substantive importance of various stories . In particular , a broad range of issues \u2014 potentially including natural disasters in outlying US territories \u2014 have an asymmetrical quality to them , where if handled appropriately most people won \u2019 t care that much , but if botched it eventually becomes a big deal .\nThis is why traditionally presidents have relied upon staff and the massive information-gathering capabilities of the American government for information rather than letting television set the agenda . Trump has a different philosophy , however , and spent the post-storm Saturday glued to his television and letting the hosts of Fox & Friends drag him into an ill-advised Twitter spat with Steph Curry and various NFL players .\n`` Fox & Friends '' covered this story at 8:24am .

The storm was huge and powerful , and it knocked out electricity and communications \u2014 that \u2019 s hard to deal with .\nThis is all true , and it goes to show that being president of the United States is a difficult job . But none of the issues the federal response is wrestling with were unknown in advance . The world had days of warning that a hurricane was heading toward Puerto Rico . The perilous state of the island \u2019 s electrical grid has been apparent for years \u2014 as has the weak financial health of its electrical utility and municipal governments .\nA president who was focused on his job could have asked in advance what the plan was for a hurricane strike on Puerto Rico . He would have discovered that since Puerto Rico is part of the United States , FEMA is the default lead agency , but it \u2019 s the US military that has the ships and helicopters that would be needed to get supplies into the interior of a wrecked island . And he could have worked something out . Instead , he didn \u2019 t get worked up about Puerto Rico until more than a week after the storm hit , when he saw the mayor of San Juan lambasting him on television . He lashed out with his usual playbook \u2014 one that will only make things worse .\nThe substantive problem that Trump \u2014 and America \u2014 is now facing is that you can \u2019 t go back in time and do the preparatory work that should have been done . You can \u2019 t pre-position satellite phones , schedule timely visits from top administration officials , or quickly dispatch ships and helicopters once you \u2019 re starting with an eight-day lag .
