    "content": "THIRTY YEARS AGO , nearly half of Louisiana voted for a Klansman , and the media struggled to explain why . It was 1990 and David Duke , the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , astonished political observers when he came within striking distance of defeating incumbent Democratic U.S . Senator J. Bennett Johnston , earning 43 percent of the vote . If Johnston \u2019 s Republican rival hadn \u2019 t dropped out of the race and endorsed him at the last minute , the outcome might have been different . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Was it economic anxiety ? The Washington Post reported that the state had \u201c a large working class that has suffered through a long recession. \u201d Was it a blow against the state \u2019 s hated political establishment ? An editorial from United Press International explained , \u201c Louisianans showed the nation by voting for Duke that they were mad as hell and not going to take it any more. \u201d Was it anti-Washington rage ? A Loyola University pollster argued , \u201c There were the voters who liked Duke , those who hated J. Bennett Johnston , and those who just wanted to send a message to Washington . \u201d\nWhat message would those voters have been trying to send by putting a Klansman into office ? \u201c There \u2019 s definitely a message bigger than Louisiana here , \u201d Susan Howell , then the director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans , told the Los Angeles Times . \u201c There is a tremendous amount of anger and frustration among working-class whites , particularly where there is an economic downturn . These people feel left out ; they feel government is not responsive to them. \u201d Duke \u2019 s strong showing , however , wasn \u2019 t powered merely by poor or working-class whites\u2014and the poorest demographic in the state , black voters , backed Johnston . Duke \u201c clobbered Johnston in white working-class districts , ran even with him in predominantly white middle-class suburbs , and lost only because black Louisianans , representing one-quarter of the electorate , voted against him in overwhelming numbers , \u201d The Washington Post reported in 1990 . Duke picked up nearly 60 percent of the white vote . Faced with Duke \u2019 s popularity among whites of all income levels , the press framed his strong showing largely as the result of the economic suffering of the white working classes . Louisiana had \u201c one of the least-educated electorates in the nation ; and a large working class that has suffered through a long recession , \u201d The Post stated . By accepting the economic theory of Duke \u2019 s success , the media were buying into the candidate \u2019 s own vision of himself as a savior of the working class . He had appealed to voters in economic terms : He tore into welfare and foreign aid , affirmative action and outsourcing , and attacked political-action committees for subverting the interests of the common man . He even tried to appeal to black voters , buying a 30-minute ad in which he declared , \u201c I \u2019 m not your enemy . \u201d\nDuke \u2019 s candidacy had initially seemed like a joke . He was a former Klan leader who had showed up to public events in a Nazi uniform and lied about having served in the Vietnam War , a cartoonishly vain supervillain whose belief in his own status as a genetic \u00dcbermensch was belied by his plastic surgeries . The joke soon soured , as many white Louisiana voters made clear that Duke \u2019 s past didn \u2019 t bother them . Many of Duke \u2019 s voters steadfastly denied that the former Klan leader was a racist . The St. Petersburg Times reported in 1990 that Duke supporters \u201c are likely to blame the media for making him look like a racist. \u201d The paper quoted G. D. Miller , a \u201c 59-year-old oil-and-gas lease buyer , \u201d who said , \u201c The way I understood the Klan , it \u2019 s not anti-this or anti-that. \u201d Duke \u2019 s rejoinder to the ads framing him as a racist resonated with his supporters . \u201c Remember , \u201d he told them at rallies , \u201c when they smear me , they are really smearing you. \u201d The economic explanation carried the day : Duke was a freak creature of the bayou who had managed to tap into the frustrations of a struggling sector of the Louisiana electorate with an abnormally high tolerance for racist messaging . While the rest of the country gawked at Louisiana and the Duke fiasco , Walker Percy , a Louisiana author , gave a prophetic warning to The New York Times . \u201c Don \u2019 t make the mistake of thinking David Duke is a unique phenomenon confined to Louisiana rednecks and yahoos . He \u2019 s not , \u201d Percy said . \u201c He \u2019 s not just appealing to the old Klan constituency , he \u2019 s appealing to the white middle class . And don \u2019 t think that he or somebody like him won \u2019 t appeal to the white middle class of Chicago or Queens . \u201d\nA few days after Duke \u2019 s strong showing , the Queens-born businessman Donald Trump appeared on CNN \u2019 s Larry King Live . \u201c It \u2019 s anger . I mean , that \u2019 s an anger vote . People are angry about what \u2019 s happened . People are angry about the jobs . If you look at Louisiana , they \u2019 re really in deep trouble , \u201d Trump told King . Trump later predicted that Duke , if he ran for president , would siphon most of his votes away from the incumbent , George H. W. Bush\u2014in the process revealing his own understanding of the effectiveness of white-nationalist appeals to the GOP base . \u201c Whether that be good or bad , David Duke is going to get a lot of votes . Pat Buchanan\u2014who really has many of the same theories , except it 's in a better package\u2014Pat Buchanan is going to take a lot of votes away from George Bush , \u201d Trump said . \u201c So if you have these two guys running , or even one of them running , I think George Bush could be in big trouble. \u201d Little more than a year later , Buchanan embarrassed Bush by drawing 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire \u2019 s Republican primary . In February 2016 , Trump was asked by a different CNN host about the former Klan leader \u2019 s endorsement of his Republican presidential bid . \u201c Well , just so you understand , I don \u2019 t know anything about David Duke . Okay ? , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I don \u2019 t know anything about what you \u2019 re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists . So I don \u2019 t know. \u201d Less than three weeks before the 2016 presidential election , Donald Trump declared himself \u201c the least racist person you have ever met . \u201d\nEven before he won , the United States was consumed by a debate over the nature of his appeal . Was racism the driving force behind Trump \u2019 s candidacy ? If so , how could Americans , the vast majority of whom say they oppose racism , back a racist candidate ? During the final few weeks of the campaign , I asked dozens of Trump supporters about their candidate \u2019 s remarks regarding Muslims and people of color . I wanted to understand how these average Republicans\u2014those who would never read the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer or go to a Klan rally at a Confederate statue\u2014had nevertheless embraced someone who demonized religious and ethnic minorities . What I found was that Trump embodied his supporters \u2019 most profound beliefs\u2014combining an insistence that discriminatory policies were necessary with vehement denials that his policies would discriminate and absolute outrage that the question would even be asked . It was not just Trump \u2019 s supporters who were in denial about what they were voting for , but Americans across the political spectrum , who , as had been the case with those who had backed Duke , searched desperately for any alternative explanation\u2014outsourcing , anti-Washington anger , economic anxiety\u2014to the one staring them in the face . The frequent postelection media expeditions to Trump country to see whether the fever has broken , or whether Trump \u2019 s most ardent supporters have changed their minds , are a direct outgrowth of this mistake . These supporters will not change their minds , because this is what they always wanted : a president who embodies the rage they feel toward those they hate and fear , while reassuring them that that rage is nothing to be ashamed of .\n\u201c I believe that everybody has a right to be in the United States no matter what your color , no matter what your race , your religion , what sex you prefer to be with , so I \u2019 m not against that at all , but I think that some of us just say racial statements without even thinking about it , \u201d a customer-care worker named Pam\u2014who , like several people I spoke with , declined to give her last name\u2014told me at a rally in Pennsylvania . However , she also defended Trump \u2019 s remarks on race and religion explicitly when I asked about them . \u201c I think the other party likes to blow it out of proportion and kind of twist his words , but what he says is what he means , and it \u2019 s what a lot of us are thinking. \u201d Most Trump supporters I spoke with were not people who thought of themselves as racist . Rather , they saw themselves as antiracist , as people who held no hostility toward religious and ethnic minorities whatsoever\u2014a sentiment they projected onto their candidate . \u201c I don \u2019 t feel like he \u2019 s racist . I don \u2019 t personally feel like anybody would have been able to do what he \u2019 s been able to do with his personal business if he were a horrible person , \u201d Michelle , a stay-at-home mom in Virginia , told me . Far more numerous and powerful than the extremists in Berkeley and Charlottesville who have drawn headlines since Trump \u2019 s election , these Americans , who would never think of themselves as possessing racial animus , voted for a candidate whose ideal vision of America excludes millions of fellow citizens because of their race or religion .\nThe specific dissonance of Trumpism\u2014advocacy for discriminatory , even cruel , policies combined with vehement denials that such policies are racially motivated\u2014provides the emotional core of its appeal . It is the most recent manifestation of a contradiction as old as the United States , a society founded by slaveholders on the principle that all men are created equal . While other factors also led to Trump \u2019 s victory\u2014the last-minute letter from former FBI Director James Comey , the sexism that rationalized supporting Trump despite his confession of sexual assault , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s neglect of the Midwest\u2014had racism been toxic to the American electorate , Trump \u2019 s candidacy would not have been viable . Nearly a year into his presidency , Trump has reneged or faltered on many of his biggest campaign promises\u2014on renegotiating NAFTA , punishing China , and replacing the Affordable Care Act with something that preserves all its popular provisions but with none of its drawbacks . But his commitment to endorsing state violence to remake the country into something resembling an idealized past has not wavered . He made a farce of his populist campaign by putting bankers in charge of the economy and industry insiders at the head of the federal agencies established to regulate their businesses . But other campaign promises have been more faithfully enacted : his ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries ; the unleashing of immigration-enforcement agencies against anyone in the country illegally regardless of whether he poses a danger ; an attempt to cut legal immigration in half ; and an abdication of the Justice Department \u2019 s constitutional responsibility to protect black Americans from corrupt or abusive police , discriminatory financial practices , and voter suppression . In his own stumbling manner , Trump has pursued the race-based agenda promoted during his campaign . As the president continues to pursue a program that places the social and political hegemony of white Christians at its core , his supporters have shown few signs of abandoning him .\nOne hundred thirty-nine years since Reconstruction , and half a century since the tail end of the civil-rights movement , a majority of white voters backed a candidate who explicitly pledged to use the power of the state against people of color and religious minorities , and stood by him as that pledge has been among the few to survive the first year of his presidency . Their support was enough to win the White House , and has solidified a return to a politics of white identity that has been one of the most destructive forces in American history . This all occurred before the eyes of a disbelieving press and political class , who plunged into fierce denial about how and why this had happened . That is the story of the 2016 election . One of the first mentions of Trump in The New York Times was in 1973 , as a result of a federal discrimination lawsuit against his buildings over his company \u2019 s refusal to rent to black tenants . In 1989 , he took out a full-page newspaper ad suggesting that the Central Park Five , black and Latino youths accused of the assault and rape of a white jogger , should be put to death . They were later exonerated . His rise to prominence in Republican politics was first fueled by his embrace of the conspiracy theory that the first black president of the United States was not an American citizen . \u201c I have people that have been studying [ Obama 's birth certificate ] and they can not believe what they 're finding , \u201d he said in 2011 . \u201c If he was n't born in this country , which is a real possibility ... then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics . \u201d\nTrump began his candidacy with a speech announcing that undocumented immigrants from Mexico were \u201c bringing drugs . They \u2019 re bringing crime . They \u2019 re rapists. \u201d And \u201c some , \u201d he said , were \u201c good people. \u201d To keep them out , he proposed building a wall and humiliating Mexico for its citizens \u2019 transgressions by forcing their government to pay for it . He vowed to ban Muslims from entering the United States . Amid heightened attention to fatal police shootings of unarmed black people and a subsequent cry for accountability , Trump decried a \u201c war on police \u201d while telling black Americans they lived in \u201c war zones , \u201d in communities that were in \u201c the worst shape they \u2019 ve ever been in \u201d \u2014a remarkable claim to make in a country that once subjected black people to chattel slavery and Jim Crow . He promised to institute a national \u201c stop and frisk \u201d policy , a police tactic that turns black and Latino Americans into criminal suspects in their own neighborhoods , and which had recently been struck down in his native New York as unconstitutional . Trump expanded on this vision in his 2016 Republican National Convention speech , which gestured toward the suffering of nonwhites and painted a dark portrait of an America under assault by people of color through crime , immigration , and competition for jobs . Trump promised , \u201c The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end , \u201d citing \u201c the president \u2019 s hometown of Chicago. \u201d He warned that \u201c 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records , ordered deported from our country , are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens , \u201d and said that Clinton was \u201c calling for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama . \u201d\nA bleak vision , but one that any regular Fox News viewer would recognize . The white-supremacist journal American Renaissance applauded Trump \u2019 s message . \u201c Each political party proposes an implicit racial vision , \u201d wrote one contributor . \u201c A Trump Administration is a return to the America that won the West , landed on the moon , and built an economy and military that stunned the world . Non-whites can participate in this , but only if they accept the traditional ( which is to say , white ) norms of American culture. \u201d Most Trump supporters I spoke with denied that they endorsed this racial vision\u2014even as they defended Trump \u2019 s rhetoric . \u201c Anytime that you disagree with someone \u2019 s point of view\u2014if you say , \u2018 I don \u2019 t like Islam \u2019 \u2014people say you \u2019 re an Islamophobe , or if you don \u2019 t like gay marriage , you \u2019 re a homophobe , and you \u2019 re hateful against the gays and Islam , or different things like that , where people are entitled to their opinion . But it doesn \u2019 t mean that you \u2019 re hateful or discriminatory , \u201d Scott Colvin , who identified himself as a Navy veteran , told me at a Trump rally in Virginia . \u201c Seeing how women are treated in the Islamic religion , it \u2019 s not very good , and he \u2019 s bringing a lot of light to it\u2014that there is a lot of drugs and crime coming across the border , and that Islam does not respect women , does not respect homosexuals\u2014and so calling it out and raising awareness to that is pretty important . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s very little evidence of Trump being openly racist or sexist , \u201d Colvin insisted . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t until he started running for president that all these stories started coming out . I don \u2019 t believe it . I \u2019 ve done the research. \u201d The plain meaning of Trumpism exists in tandem with denials of its implications ; supporters and opponents alike understand that the president \u2019 s policies and rhetoric target religious and ethnic minorities , and behave accordingly . But both supporters and opponents usually stop short of calling these policies racist . It is as if there were a pothole in the middle of the street that every driver studiously avoided , but that most insisted did not exist even as they swerved around it . That this shared understanding is seldom spoken aloud does not prevent people from acting according to its logic . It is the reason why , when Trump \u2019 s Muslim ban was first implemented , immigration officials stopped American citizens with Arabic names ; why agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol have pursued fathers and mothers outside of schools and churches and deported them , as the administration has insisted that it is prioritizing the deportation of criminals ; why Attorney General Jeff Sessions targets drug scofflaws with abandon and has dismantled even cooperative efforts at police accountability ; why the president \u2019 s voting commission has committed itself to policies that will disenfranchise voters of color ; why both schoolchildren and adults know to invoke the president \u2019 s name as a taunt against blacks , Latinos , and Muslims ; why white supremacists wear hats that say \u201c Make America great again . \u201d\nThere is virtually no personality defect that conservatives accused Obama of possessing that Trump himself does not actually possess . This , not some uncanny oracular talent , is the reason Trump \u2019 s years-old tweets channeling conservative anger at Obama apply so perfectly to his own present conduct . Trump \u2019 s great political insight was that Obama \u2019 s time in office inflicted a profound psychological wound upon many white Americans , one that he could remedy by adopting the false narrative that placed the first black president outside the bounds of American citizenship . He intuited that Obama \u2019 s presence in the White House decreased the value of what W. E. B . Du Bois described as the \u201c psychological wage \u201d of whiteness across all classes of white Americans , and that the path to their hearts lay in invoking a bygone past when this affront had not taken place , and could not take place . That the legacy of the first black president could be erased by a birther , that the woman who could have been the first female president was foiled by a man who confessed to sexual assault on tape\u2014these were not drawbacks to Trump \u2019 s candidacy , but central to understanding how he would wield power , and on whose behalf . Americans act with the understanding that Trump \u2019 s nationalism promises to restore traditional boundaries of race , gender , and sexuality . The nature of that same nationalism is to deny its essence , the better to salve the conscience and spare the soul .\nAmong the most popular explanations for Trump \u2019 s victory and the Trump phenomenon writ large is the Calamity Thesis : the belief that Trump \u2019 s election was the direct result of some great , unacknowledged social catastrophe\u2014the opioid crisis , free trade , a decline in white Americans \u2019 life expectancy\u2014heretofore ignored by cloistered elites in their coastal bubbles . The irony is that the Calamity Thesis is by far the preferred white-elite explanation for Trumpism , and is frequently invoked in arguments among elites as a way of accusing other elites of being out of touch . Perhaps the most prominent data point for the Calamity Thesis is a pair of recent Brookings Institution studies by the professors Anne Case and Angus Deaton , which showed that life expectancy has fallen among less-educated white Americans due to what they call \u201c deaths of despair \u201d from drugs , alcohol , and suicide . While the studies themselves make no mention of Trump or the election , the effects they describe are frequently invoked as explanations for the president \u2019 s appeal : White people without college degrees are living in deprivation , and in their despair , they turned to a racist demagogue who promised to solve their problems . This explanation appeals to whites across the political spectrum . On the right , it serves as an indictment of elitist liberals who used their power to assist religious and ethnic minorities rather than all Americans ; on the left , it offers a glimmer of hope that such voters can be won over by a more left-wing or redistributionist economic policy . It also has the distinct advantage of conferring innocence upon what is often referred to as the \u201c white working class. \u201d After all , it wasn \u2019 t white working-class voters \u2019 fault . They were suffering ; they had to do something .\nThe studies \u2019 methodology is sound , as is the researchers \u2019 recognition that many poor and white working-class Americans are struggling . But the research does not support the conclusions many have drawn from it\u2014that economic or social desperation by itself drove white Americans to Donald Trump . It \u2019 s true that most Trump voters framed his appeal in economic terms . Kelly , a health-care worker in North Carolina , echoed other Trump supporters when she told me that to her , \u201c Make America great again \u201d meant \u201c people being able to get jobs , people being able to come off food stamps , welfare , and that sort of thing. \u201d But a closer look at the demographics of the 2016 electorate shows something more complex than a working-class revolt sparked by prolonged suffering . Clinton defeated Trump handily among Americans making less than $ 50,000 a year . Among voters making more than that , the two candidates ran roughly even . The electorate , however , skews wealthier than the general population . Voters making less than $ 50,000 , whom Clinton won by a proportion of 53 to 41 , accounted for only 36 percent of the votes cast , while those making more than $ 50,000\u2014whom Trump won by a single point\u2014made up 64 percent . The most economically vulnerable Americans voted for Clinton overwhelmingly ; the usual presumption is exactly the opposite . If you look at white voters alone , a different picture emerges . Trump defeated Clinton among white voters in every income category , winning by a margin of 57 to 34 among whites making less than $ 30,000 ; 56 to 37 among those making between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 ; 61 to 33 for those making $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 ; 56 to 39 among those making $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 ; 50 to 45 among those making $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 ; and 48 to 43 among those making more than $ 250,000 . In other words , Trump won white voters at every level of class and income . He won workers , he won managers , he won owners , he won robber barons . This is not a working-class coalition ; it is a nationalist one .\nBut Trump \u2019 s greater appeal among low-income white voters doesn \u2019 t vindicate the Calamity Thesis . White working-class Americans dealing directly with factors that lead to a death of despair were actually less likely to support Trump , and those struggling economically were not any more likely to support him . As a 2017 study by the Public Religion Research Institute and \u2588\u2588\u2588 found , \u201c White working-class voters who reported that someone in their household was dealing with a health issue\u2014such as drug addiction , alcohol abuse , or depression\u2014were actually less likely to express support for Trump \u2019 s candidacy , \u201d while white working-class voters who had \u201c experienced a loss of social and economic standing were not any more likely to favor Trump than those whose status remained the same or improved. \u201d Trump \u2019 s support among whites decreases the higher you go on the scales of income and education . But the controlling factor seems to be not economic distress but an inclination to see nonwhites as the cause of economic problems . The poorest voters were somewhat less likely to vote for Trump than those a rung or two above them on the economic ladder . The highest-income voters actually supported Trump less than they did Mitt Romney , who in 2012 won 54 percent of voters making more than $ 100,000\u2014several points more than Trump secured , although he still fared better than Clinton . It was among voters in the middle , those whose economic circumstances were precarious but not bleak , where the benefits of Du Bois \u2019 s psychic wage appeared most in danger of being devalued , and where Trump \u2019 s message resonated most strongly . They surged toward the Republican column .\nYet when social scientists control for white voters \u2019 racial attitudes\u2014that is , whether those voters hold \u201c racially resentful \u201d views about blacks and immigrants\u2014even the educational divide disappears . In other words , the relevant factor in support for Trump among white voters was not education , or even income , but the ideological frame with which they understood their challenges and misfortunes . It is also why voters of color\u2014who suffered a genuine economic calamity in the decade before Trump \u2019 s election\u2014were almost entirely immune to those same appeals . During the aftermath of the Great Recession , the meager wealth of black and Latino families declined significantly compared with the wealth of white families . According to the Federal Reserve , \u201c Median net worth fell about 30 percent for all groups during the Great Recession . However , for black and Hispanic families , net worth continued to fall an additional 20 percent in the 2010\u201313 period , while white families ' net worth was essentially unchanged. \u201d The predatory financial practices that fueled the housing bubble also targeted people of color\u2014 modernized versions of the very same racist plunder that caused the wealth gaps to begin with . But there was no corresponding radicalization of the black and Latino population , no mass election to Congress of ethno-nationalist demagogues promising vengeance on the perpetrators . Those numbers also reveal a much more complicated story than a Trump base made up of struggling working-class Americans turning to Trump as a result of their personal financial difficulties , not their ideological convictions . An avalanche of stories poured forth from mainstream media outlets , all with the same basic thesis : Trump \u2019 s appeal was less about racism than it was about hardship\u2014or , in the euphemism turned running joke , \u201c economic anxiety. \u201d Worse still , euphemisms such as \u201c regular Americans , \u201d typically employed by politicians to refer to white people , were now adopted by political reporters and writers wholesale : To be a regular or working-class American was to be white .\nOne early use of economic anxiety as an explanation for the Trump phenomenon came from NBC News \u2019 s Chuck Todd , in July 2015 . \u201c Trump and Sanders supporters are disenchanted with what they see as a broken system , fed up with political correctness and Washington dysfunction , \u201d Todd said . \u201c Economic anxiety is fueling both campaigns , but that \u2019 s where the similarities end. \u201d The idea that economic suffering could lead people to support either Trump or Sanders , two candidates with little in common , illustrates the salience of an ideological frame . Suffering alone doesn \u2019 t impel such choices ; what does is how the causes of such hardship are understood . Some Trump voters I spoke with were convinced , for example , that undocumented immigrants had access to a generous welfare state that was denied to everyone else . \u201c You look at all these illegal immigrants coming in who are getting services that most Americans aren \u2019 t getting as far as insurance , welfare , Medicaid , all that jazz , \u201d Richard Jenkins , a landscaper in North Carolina , told me . Steve , a Trump supporter who runs a floor-covering business in Virginia \u2019 s Tidewater area , told me that it \u201c seems like people coming to this country , whether it \u2019 s illegally or through a legal system of immigration , are being treated better than American veterans. \u201d If you believe that other people are getting the assistance you deserve , you are likely to oppose that assistance . But first you have to believe this .\nThe economic-anxiety argument retains a great deal of currency . As Mark Lilla , a Columbia professor , put it while defending the thesis of his book in an interview with Slate , \u201c Marxists are much more on-point here . Their argument has always been that people become racist\u2014and there are lots of reasons why they do , but the people who might be on the edge are drawn to racist rhetoric and anti-immigrant rhetoric because they \u2019 ve been economically disenfranchised , and so they look for a scapegoat , and so the real problems are economic . I think they \u2019 re closer to the truth right now than to think that somehow just some racist demon is directing everything in this country . It \u2019 s just not where the country is. \u201d Lilla \u2019 s argument falls apart at the slightest scrutiny : Wealth does not insulate one from racism , or the entire slaveholding planter class of the South could not have existed . Rather , racism and nationalism form an ideological lens through which to view suffering and misfortune . It is perhaps too much to expect that people who hope to use Marxist theory to absolve voters of racism cite those Marxist historians whose body of work engages precisely this topic . In Black Reconstruction in America , W. E. B . Du Bois examined not only the acquiescence of Northern capital to Southern racial hegemony after the Civil War , but also white labor \u2019 s decision that preserving a privileged spot in the racial hierarchy was more attractive than standing in solidarity with black workers .\n\u201c North and South agreed that laborers must produce profit ; the poor white and the Negro wanted to get the profit arising from the laborers \u2019 toil and not to divide it with the employers and landowners , \u201d Du Bois wrote . \u201c When Northern and Southern employers agreed that profit was most important and the method of getting it second , the path to understanding was clear . When white laborers were convinced that the degradation of Negro labor was more fundamental than the uplift of white labor , the end was in sight. \u201d In exchange , white laborers , \u201c while they received a low wage , were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. \u201d For centuries , capital \u2019 s most potent wedge against labor in America has been the belief that it is better to be poor than to be equal to niggers . Overall , poor and working-class Americans did not support Trump ; it was white Americans on all levels of the income spectrum who secured his victory . Clinton was only competitive with Trump among white people making more than $ 100,000 , but the fact that their shares of the vote was nearly identical drives the point home : Economic suffering alone does not explain the rise of Trump . Nor does the Calamity Thesis explain why comparably situated black Americans , who are considerably more vulnerable than their white counterparts , remained so immune to Trump \u2019 s appeal . The answer can not be that black Americans were suffering less than the white working class or the poor , but that Trump \u2019 s solutions did not appeal to people of color because they were premised on a national vision that excluded them as full citizens .",

It was 1990 and David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, astonished political observers when he came within striking distance of defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, earning 43 percent of the vote. If Johnston\u2019s Republican rival hadn\u2019t dropped out of the race and endorsed him at the last minute, the outcome might have been different. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Was it economic anxiety? The Washington Post reported that the state had \u201ca large working class that has suffered through a long recession.\u201d Was it a blow against the state\u2019s hated political establishment? An editorial from United Press International explained, \u201cLouisianans showed the nation by voting for Duke that they were mad as hell and not going to take it any more.\u201d Was it anti-Washington rage? A Loyola University pollster argued, \u201cThere were the voters who liked Duke, those who hated J. Bennett Johnston, and those who just wanted to send a message to Washington.\u201d\n\nWhat message would those voters have been trying to send by putting a Klansman into office? \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a message bigger than Louisiana here,\u201d Susan Howell, then the director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of anger and frustration among working-class whites, particularly where there is an economic downturn. These people feel left out; they feel government is not responsive to them.\u201d Duke\u2019s strong showing, however, wasn\u2019t powered merely by poor or working-class whites\u2014and the poorest demographic in the state, black voters, backed Johnston. Duke \u201cclobbered Johnston in white working-class districts, ran even with him in predominantly white middle-class suburbs, and lost only because black Louisianans, representing one-quarter of the electorate, voted against him in overwhelming numbers,\u201d The Washington Post reported in 1990. Duke picked up nearly 60 percent of the white vote. Faced with Duke\u2019s popularity among whites of all income levels, the press framed his strong showing largely as the result of the economic suffering of the white working classes. Louisiana had \u201cone of the least-educated electorates in the nation; and a large working class that has suffered through a long recession,\u201d The Post stated. By accepting the economic theory of Duke\u2019s success, the media were buying into the candidate\u2019s own vision of himself as a savior of the working class. He had appealed to voters in economic terms: He tore into welfare and foreign aid, affirmative action and outsourcing, and attacked political-action committees for subverting the interests of the common man. He even tried to appeal to black voters, buying a 30-minute ad in which he declared, \u201cI\u2019m not your enemy.\u201d\n\nDuke\u2019s candidacy had initially seemed like a joke. He was a former Klan leader who had showed up to public events in a Nazi uniform and lied about having served in the Vietnam War, a cartoonishly vain supervillain whose belief in his own status as a genetic \u00dcbermensch was belied by his plastic surgeries. The joke soon soured, as many white Louisiana voters made clear that Duke\u2019s past didn\u2019t bother them. Many of Duke\u2019s voters steadfastly denied that the former Klan leader was a racist. The St. Petersburg Times reported in 1990 that Duke supporters \u201care likely to blame the media for making him look like a racist.\u201d The paper quoted G. D. Miller, a \u201c59-year-old oil-and-gas lease buyer,\u201d who said, \u201cThe way I understood the Klan, it\u2019s not anti-this or anti-that.\u201d Duke\u2019s rejoinder to the ads framing him as a racist resonated with his supporters. \u201cRemember,\u201d he told them at rallies, \u201cwhen they smear me, they are really smearing you.\u201d The economic explanation carried the day: Duke was a freak creature of the bayou who had managed to tap into the frustrations of a struggling sector of the Louisiana electorate with an abnormally high tolerance for racist messaging. While the rest of the country gawked at Louisiana and the Duke fiasco, Walker Percy, a Louisiana author, gave a prophetic warning to The New York Times. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking David Duke is a unique phenomenon confined to Louisiana rednecks and yahoos. He\u2019s not,\u201d Percy said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just appealing to the old Klan constituency, he\u2019s appealing to the white middle class. And don\u2019t think that he or somebody like him won\u2019t appeal to the white middle class of Chicago or Queens.\u201d\n\nA few days after Duke\u2019s strong showing, the Queens-born businessman Donald Trump appeared on CNN\u2019s Larry King Live. \u201cIt\u2019s anger. I mean, that\u2019s an anger vote. People are angry about what\u2019s happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they\u2019re really in deep trouble,\u201d Trump told King. Trump later predicted that Duke, if he ran for president, would siphon most of his votes away from the incumbent, George H. W. Bush\u2014in the process revealing his own understanding of the effectiveness of white-nationalist appeals to the GOP base. \u201cWhether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Pat Buchanan\u2014who really has many of the same theories, except it's in a better package\u2014Pat Buchanan is going to take a lot of votes away from George Bush,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo if you have these two guys running, or even one of them running, I think George Bush could be in big trouble.\u201d Little more than a year later, Buchanan embarrassed Bush by drawing 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire\u2019s Republican primary. In February 2016, Trump was asked by a different CNN host about the former Klan leader\u2019s endorsement of his Republican presidential bid. \u201cWell, just so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. Okay?,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don\u2019t know.\u201d Less than three weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump declared himself \u201cthe least racist person you have ever met.\u201d\n\nEven before he won, the United States was consumed by a debate over the nature of his appeal. Was racism the driving force behind Trump\u2019s candidacy? If so, how could Americans, the vast majority of whom say they oppose racism, back a racist candidate? During the final few weeks of the campaign, I asked dozens of Trump supporters about their candidate\u2019s remarks regarding Muslims and people of color. I wanted to understand how these average Republicans\u2014those who would never read the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer or go to a Klan rally at a Confederate statue\u2014had nevertheless embraced someone who demonized religious and ethnic minorities. What I found was that Trump embodied his supporters\u2019 most profound beliefs\u2014combining an insistence that discriminatory policies were necessary with vehement denials that his policies would discriminate and absolute outrage that the question would even be asked. It was not just Trump\u2019s supporters who were in denial about what they were voting for, but Americans across the political spectrum, who, as had been the case with those who had backed Duke, searched desperately for any alternative explanation\u2014outsourcing, anti-Washington anger, economic anxiety\u2014to the one staring them in the face. The frequent postelection media expeditions to Trump country to see whether the fever has broken, or whether Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters have changed their minds, are a direct outgrowth of this mistake. These supporters will not change their minds, because this is what they always wanted: a president who embodies the rage they feel toward those they hate and fear, while reassuring them that that rage is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\u201cI believe that everybody has a right to be in the United States no matter what your color, no matter what your race, your religion, what sex you prefer to be with, so I\u2019m not against that at all, but I think that some of us just say racial statements without even thinking about it,\u201d a customer-care worker named Pam\u2014who, like several people I spoke with, declined to give her last name\u2014told me at a rally in Pennsylvania. However, she also defended Trump\u2019s remarks on race and religion explicitly when I asked about them. \u201cI think the other party likes to blow it out of proportion and kind of twist his words, but what he says is what he means, and it\u2019s what a lot of us are thinking.\u201d Most Trump supporters I spoke with were not people who thought of themselves as racist. Rather, they saw themselves as antiracist, as people who held no hostility toward religious and ethnic minorities whatsoever\u2014a sentiment they projected onto their candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s racist. I don\u2019t personally feel like anybody would have been able to do what he\u2019s been able to do with his personal business if he were a horrible person,\u201d Michelle, a stay-at-home mom in Virginia, told me. Far more numerous and powerful than the extremists in Berkeley and Charlottesville who have drawn headlines since Trump\u2019s election, these Americans, who would never think of themselves as possessing racial animus, voted for a candidate whose ideal vision of America excludes millions of fellow citizens because of their race or religion.\n\nThe specific dissonance of Trumpism\u2014advocacy for discriminatory, even cruel, policies combined with vehement denials that such policies are racially motivated\u2014provides the emotional core of its appeal. It is the most recent manifestation of a contradiction as old as the United States, a society founded by slaveholders on the principle that all men are created equal. While other factors also led to Trump\u2019s victory\u2014the last-minute letter from former FBI Director James Comey, the sexism that rationalized supporting Trump despite his confession of sexual assault, Hillary Clinton\u2019s neglect of the Midwest\u2014had racism been toxic to the American electorate, Trump\u2019s candidacy would not have been viable. Nearly a year into his presidency, Trump has reneged or faltered on many of his biggest campaign promises\u2014on renegotiating NAFTA, punishing China, and replacing the Affordable Care Act with something that preserves all its popular provisions but with none of its drawbacks. But his commitment to endorsing state violence to remake the country into something resembling an idealized past has not wavered. He made a farce of his populist campaign by putting bankers in charge of the economy and industry insiders at the head of the federal agencies established to regulate their businesses. But other campaign promises have been more faithfully enacted: his ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries; the unleashing of immigration-enforcement agencies against anyone in the country illegally regardless of whether he poses a danger; an attempt to cut legal immigration in half; and an abdication of the Justice Department\u2019s constitutional responsibility to protect black Americans from corrupt or abusive police, discriminatory financial practices, and voter suppression. In his own stumbling manner, Trump has pursued the race-based agenda promoted during his campaign. As the president continues to pursue a program that places the social and political hegemony of white Christians at its core, his supporters have shown few signs of abandoning him.\n\nOne hundred thirty-nine years since Reconstruction, and half a century since the tail end of the civil-rights movement, a majority of white voters backed a candidate who explicitly pledged to use the power of the state against people of color and religious minorities, and stood by him as that pledge has been among the few to survive the first year of his presidency. Their support was enough to win the White House, and has solidified a return to a politics of white identity that has been one of the most destructive forces in American history. This all occurred before the eyes of a disbelieving press and political class, who plunged into fierce denial about how and why this had happened. That is the story of the 2016 election. One of the first mentions of Trump in The New York Times was in 1973, as a result of a federal discrimination lawsuit against his buildings over his company\u2019s refusal to rent to black tenants. In 1989, he took out a full-page newspaper ad suggesting that the Central Park Five, black and Latino youths accused of the assault and rape of a white jogger, should be put to death. They were later exonerated. His rise to prominence in Republican politics was first fueled by his embrace of the conspiracy theory that the first black president of the United States was not an American citizen. \u201cI have people that have been studying [Obama's birth certificate] and they cannot believe what they're finding,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cIf he wasn't born in this country, which is a real possibility ... then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics.\u201d\n\nTrump began his candidacy with a speech announcing that undocumented immigrants from Mexico were \u201cbringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d And \u201csome,\u201d he said, were \u201cgood people.\u201d To keep them out, he proposed building a wall and humiliating Mexico for its citizens\u2019 transgressions by forcing their government to pay for it. He vowed to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Amid heightened attention to fatal police shootings of unarmed black people and a subsequent cry for accountability, Trump decried a \u201cwar on police\u201d while telling black Americans they lived in \u201cwar zones,\u201d in communities that were in \u201cthe worst shape they\u2019ve ever been in\u201d\u2014a remarkable claim to make in a country that once subjected black people to chattel slavery and Jim Crow. He promised to institute a national \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policy, a police tactic that turns black and Latino Americans into criminal suspects in their own neighborhoods, and which had recently been struck down in his native New York as unconstitutional. Trump expanded on this vision in his 2016 Republican National Convention speech, which gestured toward the suffering of nonwhites and painted a dark portrait of an America under assault by people of color through crime, immigration, and competition for jobs. Trump promised, \u201cThe crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end,\u201d citing \u201cthe president\u2019s hometown of Chicago.\u201d He warned that \u201c180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens,\u201d and said that Clinton was \u201ccalling for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.\u201d\n\nA bleak vision, but one that any regular Fox News viewer would recognize. The white-supremacist journal American Renaissance applauded Trump\u2019s message. \u201cEach political party proposes an implicit racial vision,\u201d wrote one contributor. \u201cA Trump Administration is a return to the America that won the West, landed on the moon, and built an economy and military that stunned the world. Non-whites can participate in this, but only if they accept the traditional (which is to say, white) norms of American culture.\u201d Most Trump supporters I spoke with denied that they endorsed this racial vision\u2014even as they defended Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cAnytime that you disagree with someone\u2019s point of view\u2014if you say, \u2018I don\u2019t like Islam\u2019\u2014people say you\u2019re an Islamophobe, or if you don\u2019t like gay marriage, you\u2019re a homophobe, and you\u2019re hateful against the gays and Islam, or different things like that, where people are entitled to their opinion. But it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re hateful or discriminatory,\u201d Scott Colvin, who identified himself as a Navy veteran, told me at a Trump rally in Virginia. \u201cSeeing how women are treated in the Islamic religion, it\u2019s not very good, and he\u2019s bringing a lot of light to it\u2014that there is a lot of drugs and crime coming across the border, and that Islam does not respect women, does not respect homosexuals\u2014and so calling it out and raising awareness to that is pretty important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little evidence of Trump being openly racist or sexist,\u201d Colvin insisted. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until he started running for president that all these stories started coming out. I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve done the research.\u201d The plain meaning of Trumpism exists in tandem with denials of its implications; supporters and opponents alike understand that the president\u2019s policies and rhetoric target religious and ethnic minorities, and behave accordingly. But both supporters and opponents usually stop short of calling these policies racist. It is as if there were a pothole in the middle of the street that every driver studiously avoided, but that most insisted did not exist even as they swerved around it. That this shared understanding is seldom spoken aloud does not prevent people from acting according to its logic. It is the reason why, when Trump\u2019s Muslim ban was first implemented, immigration officials stopped American citizens with Arabic names; why agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol have pursued fathers and mothers outside of schools and churches and deported them, as the administration has insisted that it is prioritizing the deportation of criminals; why Attorney General Jeff Sessions targets drug scofflaws with abandon and has dismantled even cooperative efforts at police accountability; why the president\u2019s voting commission has committed itself to policies that will disenfranchise voters of color; why both schoolchildren and adults know to invoke the president\u2019s name as a taunt against blacks, Latinos, and Muslims; why white supremacists wear hats that say \u201cMake America great again.\u201d\n\nThere is virtually no personality defect that conservatives accused Obama of possessing that Trump himself does not actually possess. This, not some uncanny oracular talent, is the reason Trump\u2019s years-old tweets channeling conservative anger at Obama apply so perfectly to his own present conduct. Trump\u2019s great political insight was that Obama\u2019s time in office inflicted a profound psychological wound upon many white Americans, one that he could remedy by adopting the false narrative that placed the first black president outside the bounds of American citizenship. He intuited that Obama\u2019s presence in the White House decreased the value of what W. E. B. Du Bois described as the \u201cpsychological wage\u201d of whiteness across all classes of white Americans, and that the path to their hearts lay in invoking a bygone past when this affront had not taken place, and could not take place. That the legacy of the first black president could be erased by a birther, that the woman who could have been the first female president was foiled by a man who confessed to sexual assault on tape\u2014these were not drawbacks to Trump\u2019s candidacy, but central to understanding how he would wield power, and on whose behalf. Americans act with the understanding that Trump\u2019s nationalism promises to restore traditional boundaries of race, gender, and sexuality. The nature of that same nationalism is to deny its essence, the better to salve the conscience and spare the soul.\n\nAmong the most popular explanations for Trump\u2019s victory and the Trump phenomenon writ large is the Calamity Thesis: the belief that Trump\u2019s election was the direct result of some great, unacknowledged social catastrophe\u2014the opioid crisis, free trade, a decline in white Americans\u2019 life expectancy\u2014heretofore ignored by cloistered elites in their coastal bubbles. The irony is that the Calamity Thesis is by far the preferred white-elite explanation for Trumpism, and is frequently invoked in arguments among elites as a way of accusing other elites of being out of touch. Perhaps the most prominent data point for the Calamity Thesis is a pair of recent Brookings Institution studies by the professors Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which showed that life expectancy has fallen among less-educated white Americans due to what they call \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. While the studies themselves make no mention of Trump or the election, the effects they describe are frequently invoked as explanations for the president\u2019s appeal: White people without college degrees are living in deprivation, and in their despair, they turned to a racist demagogue who promised to solve their problems. This explanation appeals to whites across the political spectrum. On the right, it serves as an indictment of elitist liberals who used their power to assist religious and ethnic minorities rather than all Americans; on the left, it offers a glimmer of hope that such voters can be won over by a more left-wing or redistributionist economic policy. It also has the distinct advantage of conferring innocence upon what is often referred to as the \u201cwhite working class.\u201d After all, it wasn\u2019t white working-class voters\u2019 fault. They were suffering; they had to do something.\n\nThe studies\u2019 methodology is sound, as is the researchers\u2019 recognition that many poor and white working-class Americans are struggling. But the research does not support the conclusions many have drawn from it\u2014that economic or social desperation by itself drove white Americans to Donald Trump. It\u2019s true that most Trump voters framed his appeal in economic terms. Kelly, a health-care worker in North Carolina, echoed other Trump supporters when she told me that to her, \u201cMake America great again\u201d meant \u201cpeople being able to get jobs, people being able to come off food stamps, welfare, and that sort of thing.\u201d But a closer look at the demographics of the 2016 electorate shows something more complex than a working-class revolt sparked by prolonged suffering. Clinton defeated Trump handily among Americans making less than $50,000 a year. Among voters making more than that, the two candidates ran roughly even. The electorate, however, skews wealthier than the general population. Voters making less than $50,000, whom Clinton won by a proportion of 53 to 41, accounted for only 36 percent of the votes cast, while those making more than $50,000\u2014whom Trump won by a single point\u2014made up 64 percent. The most economically vulnerable Americans voted for Clinton overwhelmingly; the usual presumption is exactly the opposite. If you look at white voters alone, a different picture emerges. Trump defeated Clinton among white voters in every income category, winning by a margin of 57 to 34 among whites making less than $30,000; 56 to 37 among those making between $30,000 and $50,000; 61 to 33 for those making $50,000 to $100,000; 56 to 39 among those making $100,000 to $200,000; 50 to 45 among those making $200,000 to $250,000; and 48 to 43 among those making more than $250,000. In other words, Trump won white voters at every level of class and income. He won workers, he won managers, he won owners, he won robber barons. This is not a working-class coalition; it is a nationalist one.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s greater appeal among low-income white voters doesn\u2019t vindicate the Calamity Thesis. White working-class Americans dealing directly with factors that lead to a death of despair were actually less likely to support Trump, and those struggling economically were not any more likely to support him. As a 2017 study by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic found, \u201cWhite working-class voters who reported that someone in their household was dealing with a health issue\u2014such as drug addiction, alcohol abuse, or depression\u2014were actually less likely to express support for Trump\u2019s candidacy,\u201d while white working-class voters who had \u201cexperienced a loss of social and economic standing were not any more likely to favor Trump than those whose status remained the same or improved.\u201d Trump\u2019s support among whites decreases the higher you go on the scales of income and education. But the controlling factor seems to be not economic distress but an inclination to see nonwhites as the cause of economic problems. The poorest voters were somewhat less likely to vote for Trump than those a rung or two above them on the economic ladder. The highest-income voters actually supported Trump less than they did Mitt Romney, who in 2012 won 54 percent of voters making more than $100,000\u2014several points more than Trump secured, although he still fared better than Clinton. It was among voters in the middle, those whose economic circumstances were precarious but not bleak, where the benefits of Du Bois\u2019s psychic wage appeared most in danger of being devalued, and where Trump\u2019s message resonated most strongly. They surged toward the Republican column.\n\nYet when social scientists control for white voters\u2019 racial attitudes\u2014that is, whether those voters hold \u201cracially resentful\u201d views about blacks and immigrants\u2014even the educational divide disappears. In other words, the relevant factor in support for Trump among white voters was not education, or even income, but the ideological frame with which they understood their challenges and misfortunes. It is also why voters of color\u2014who suffered a genuine economic calamity in the decade before Trump\u2019s election\u2014were almost entirely immune to those same appeals. During the aftermath of the Great Recession, the meager wealth of black and Latino families declined significantly compared with the wealth of white families. According to the Federal Reserve, \u201cMedian net worth fell about 30 percent for all groups during the Great Recession. However, for black and Hispanic families, net worth continued to fall an additional 20 percent in the 2010\u201313 period, while white families' net worth was essentially unchanged.\u201d The predatory financial practices that fueled the housing bubble also targeted people of color\u2014 modernized versions of the very same racist plunder that caused the wealth gaps to begin with. But there was no corresponding radicalization of the black and Latino population, no mass election to Congress of ethno-nationalist demagogues promising vengeance on the perpetrators. Those numbers also reveal a much more complicated story than a Trump base made up of struggling working-class Americans turning to Trump as a result of their personal financial difficulties, not their ideological convictions. An avalanche of stories poured forth from mainstream media outlets, all with the same basic thesis: Trump\u2019s appeal was less about racism than it was about hardship\u2014or, in the euphemism turned running joke, \u201ceconomic anxiety.\u201d Worse still, euphemisms such as \u201cregular Americans,\u201d typically employed by politicians to refer to white people, were now adopted by political reporters and writers wholesale: To be a regular or working-class American was to be white.\n\nOne early use of economic anxiety as an explanation for the Trump phenomenon came from NBC News\u2019s Chuck Todd, in July 2015. \u201cTrump and Sanders supporters are disenchanted with what they see as a broken system, fed up with political correctness and Washington dysfunction,\u201d Todd said. \u201cEconomic anxiety is fueling both campaigns, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.\u201d The idea that economic suffering could lead people to support either Trump or Sanders, two candidates with little in common, illustrates the salience of an ideological frame. Suffering alone doesn\u2019t impel such choices; what does is how the causes of such hardship are understood. Some Trump voters I spoke with were convinced, for example, that undocumented immigrants had access to a generous welfare state that was denied to everyone else. \u201cYou look at all these illegal immigrants coming in who are getting services that most Americans aren\u2019t getting as far as insurance, welfare, Medicaid, all that jazz,\u201d Richard Jenkins, a landscaper in North Carolina, told me. Steve, a Trump supporter who runs a floor-covering business in Virginia\u2019s Tidewater area, told me that it \u201cseems like people coming to this country, whether it\u2019s illegally or through a legal system of immigration, are being treated better than American veterans.\u201d If you believe that other people are getting the assistance you deserve, you are likely to oppose that assistance. But first you have to believe this.\n\nThe economic-anxiety argument retains a great deal of currency. As Mark Lilla, a Columbia professor, put it while defending the thesis of his book in an interview with Slate, \u201cMarxists are much more on-point here. Their argument has always been that people become racist\u2014and there are lots of reasons why they do, but the people who might be on the edge are drawn to racist rhetoric and anti-immigrant rhetoric because they\u2019ve been economically disenfranchised, and so they look for a scapegoat, and so the real problems are economic. I think they\u2019re closer to the truth right now than to think that somehow just some racist demon is directing everything in this country. It\u2019s just not where the country is.\u201d Lilla\u2019s argument falls apart at the slightest scrutiny: Wealth does not insulate one from racism, or the entire slaveholding planter class of the South could not have existed. Rather, racism and nationalism form an ideological lens through which to view suffering and misfortune. It is perhaps too much to expect that people who hope to use Marxist theory to absolve voters of racism cite those Marxist historians whose body of work engages precisely this topic. In Black Reconstruction in America, W. E. B. Du Bois examined not only the acquiescence of Northern capital to Southern racial hegemony after the Civil War, but also white labor\u2019s decision that preserving a privileged spot in the racial hierarchy was more attractive than standing in solidarity with black workers.\n\n\u201cNorth and South agreed that laborers must produce profit; the poor white and the Negro wanted to get the profit arising from the laborers\u2019 toil and not to divide it with the employers and landowners,\u201d Du Bois wrote. \u201cWhen Northern and Southern employers agreed that profit was most important and the method of getting it second, the path to understanding was clear. When white laborers were convinced that the degradation of Negro labor was more fundamental than the uplift of white labor, the end was in sight.\u201d In exchange, white laborers, \u201cwhile they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage.\u201d For centuries, capital\u2019s most potent wedge against labor in America has been the belief that it is better to be poor than to be equal to niggers. Overall, poor and working-class Americans did not support Trump; it was white Americans on all levels of the income spectrum who secured his victory. Clinton was only competitive with Trump among white people making more than $100,000, but the fact that their shares of the vote was nearly identical drives the point home: Economic suffering alone does not explain the rise of Trump. Nor does the Calamity Thesis explain why comparably situated black Americans, who are considerably more vulnerable than their white counterparts, remained so immune to Trump\u2019s appeal. The answer cannot be that black Americans were suffering less than the white working class or the poor, but that Trump\u2019s solutions did not appeal to people of color because they were premised on a national vision that excluded them as full citizens.",
