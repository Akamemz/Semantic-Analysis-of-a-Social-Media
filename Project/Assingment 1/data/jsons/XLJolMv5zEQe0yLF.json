    "content": "Michael J. Socolow , author of Six Minutes in Berlin : Broadcast Spectacle and Rowing Gold at the Nazi Olympics , is an associate professor of communication and journalism at the University of Maine .\nMargaret Sullivan was having fun . The Washington Post media critic and former public editor of the New York Times collaborated in the production of a humorous musical video on TikTok earlier this month . \u201c You hardened journos may think this is pointless , \u201d she tweeted , \u201c but the street cred I now have with my 12-year-old twin goddaughters ... \u201d A few days later , another Washington Post TikTok popped up , tweeted by Dave Jorgenson , the Post \u2019 s in-house TikTok expert . In it , happy newsroom faces flash by in a series of quick cuts , with the notable exception of a deadpan Marty Baron , the paper \u2019 s executive editor .\nSet to upbeat music , these quirky videos seem relatively harmless . They \u2019 re simple promotional vehicles , and they attract young TikTok-loving audiences . But America \u2019 s journalists , like America \u2019 s youth , are falling in love with the most effective medium ever introduced to extend Chinese media practices into the United States . Journalists should not be promoting a platform with a documented history of political censorship . Nor should journalists use TikTok as a news medium , because TikTok\u2014unlike other attempts to extend authoritarian media globally , such as RT ( Russia Today ) \u2014relies on its users \u2019 ignorance of its origins and practices . How many teens , or journalists , are aware TikTok \u2019 s Chinese parent company , Bytedance , paid what was at the time the largest fine in Federal Trade Commission history for invading the privacy of underage users ?\nTikTok seems like a great new media story , and , in some ways , it is . For a relatively new social media platform , TikTok \u2019 s numbers are staggering . It is the No . 1 app downloaded in the iOS store , and it \u2019 s estimated that in the first quarter of 2019 , more than 220 million TikTok app downloads occurred between Google Play and Apple \u2019 s iOS store . Funny TikTok memes pop up on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , as well as in its proprietary app . If TikTok seems like it \u2019 s everywhere these days , that \u2019 s because Bytedance spends a fortune to keep teens hooked and to keep everyone else talking about it . In September , TikTok was the top advertiser on Snapchat , and the second-largest advertiser on Youtube . The Wall Street Journal reports that Bytedance plans to spend an astounding $ 1 billion advertising TikTok this year .\nBut from a journalistic perspective , the question of what can \u2019 t be found on TikTok is more important than the quirky music videos that dominate the app . TikTok , which is called Douyin in China , is the first successful global social media giant pioneered domestically under the Chinese censorship regime , and since the app \u2019 s introduction , questions have swirled about what videos are allowed to appear on the platform . According to internal documents describing TikTok \u2019 s guidelines obtained by the Guardian\u2014policies that TikTok now claims are outdated and no longer employed\u2014TikTok censored videos mentioning taboo topics in China , such as Tiananmen Square , Tibetan and Taiwanese independence and the Falun Gong . Likewise , videos and hashtags about the Hong Kong protests \u201c barely exist on TikTok , \u201d the Washington Post noted . A former TikTok content moderator told the New York Times that , in the newspaper \u2019 s words , \u201c managers in the United States had instructed moderators to hide videos that included any political messages or themes , not just those related to China . \u201d\nTikTok is both an audacious attempt to extend Chinese global media reach and a fun app that promotes joy . Those two realities aren \u2019 t mutually exclusive . In fact , they \u2019 re symbiotic . According to the documents obtained by the Guardian , TikTok censored numerous subjects that extend beyond the obvious topics deemed dangerous to the Chinese state . According to the Guardian \u2019 s reporting on the directives in the documents , TikTok suppressed videos about \u201c a specific list of 20 \u2018 foreign leaders or sensitive figures \u2019 including Kim Jong-il , Kim Il-sung , Mahatma Gandhi , Vladimir Putin , Donald Trump , Barack Obama , Kim Jong-un , [ and ] Shinzo Abe. \u201d Think of how much social media vitriol is generated by figures on that list , and it \u2019 s easy to understand why a fun app would want to blacklist those politically divisive figures .\nAfter the documents were revealed , the company issued a statement denying it continues its previous policies . \u201c Let us be very clear , \u201d the company said , \u201c TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China . We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked . Period . Our U.S. moderation team , which is led out of California , reviews content for adherence to our U.S. policies\u2014just like other U.S. companies in our space . We are not influenced by any foreign government , including the Chinese government . \u201d\nStill , despite TikTok \u2019 s new claims to be observing standard U.S. media practices , it \u2019 s clear that until very recently TikTok more closely monitored its content than its American social media competitors did . Even if TikTok might not formally remove content , the former content moderator interviewed by the New York Times noted that TikTok employed what \u2019 s commonly known as \u201c shadow banning , \u201d a practice that would allow \u201c such political posts to remain on users \u2019 profile pages but \u2026 prevent them from being shared more widely in TikTok \u2019 s main video feed . \u201d\nThe global debate over the tension between free expression and social harmony is seemingly playing out everywhere today . China \u2019 s enormous economic leverage has created new parameters for conduct and behavior by business partners seeking access to the Chinese market . Just as the NBA had to very carefully navigate a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive supporting the Hong Kong protests that infuriated the Chinese state , so too must Hollywood producers , video game corporations , book and newspaper publishers , and numerous other businesses navigate Chinese censorship demands . These demands are becoming more common and more insistent , and on platforms like TikTok , they \u2019 ll no doubt continue to emerge .\nChinese censorship has gone global . Just as the U.S. government spent the second half of the 20th century encouraging the global expansion of American values , such as freedom of expression , the Chinese government has now opened the first half of the 21st century by promoting global restrictions intended to ensure approving portrayals of Chinese state authority . The consequences of this evolution in global media culture arise almost daily . When Facebook \u2019 s Mark Zuckerberg proclaims the importance of free speech , as he did recently in a speech at Georgetown University , his implicit target is the Chinese regime that bans Facebook , not progressives who want Facebook to more tightly regulate political advertising and hate speech . Facebook , it should be noted , will soon launch \u201c Lasso , \u201d a direct competitor to TikTok .\nIn recent public pronouncements and congressional hearings , some U.S. politicians argue Twitter and Facebook are , in fact , doing too little to combat the dangerous spread of misinformation and inflammatory propaganda . Under this line of thinking , moderation policies like TikTok \u2019 s might offer a remedy to America 's social media ills . Senator Kamala Harris , for example , has called for Twitter to shutter President Donald Trump \u2019 s account because of what she says are his violations of Twitter \u2019 s terms of service . Zuckerberg had no answer when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Facebook would prohibit political advertisements featuring provable and obvious lies .\nThis battle between free expression and policing of content is playing out within TikTok , too . The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ISIS uploaded gruesome torture and beheading videos\u2014set to danceable music and accompanied with celebratory emojis\u2014to TikTok . The videos were not detected and deleted by TikTok until the newspaper made the company aware of their existence . By then , they had been shared thousands of times . When terrorists and criminals violate terms of service by spreading messages or portraying crimes that directly inspire violence through algorithmic networks , some level of content control might be deemed legitimate even by libertarian critics . Questions like these speak to the most fundamental notions of what constitutes an ethical and responsible public sphere and how a society should organize and regulate its media .\nDemocracy and efficiency often sit in conflict . The issues arising with TikTok , Facebook and Twitter are forcing every nation and society to calibrate its tolerance for media freedom on a spectrum that runs from the protection of liberty through the encouragement of accuracy to the enforcement of harmony .\nIt \u2019 s the responsibility of journalists to explain this context , and right now , they \u2019 re falling down on the job . Not long ago , the New York Times published a largely celebratory article about TikTok and its embrace by American high school students and educators . The reporter , Taylor Lorenz , noted parenthetically that TikTok \u2019 s corporate owner Bytedance is a \u201c Chinese tech conglomerate , \u201d but nowhere was TikTok \u2019 s history of censorship of content inimical to the Chinese state \u2019 s authority mentioned .\nPerhaps more important , nowhere did Lorenz mention TikTok paid a $ 5.7 million fine to the U.S. government earlier this year . The fine , paid to settle violations identified by the FTC , involved the illegal collection of \u201c names , email addresses , pictures and locations of kids under age 13 , \u201d as the Washington Post reported , adding that it was \u201c a record penalty for violations of the nation \u2019 s child privacy law. \u201d One would think a feature article celebrating a social media app \u2019 s enormous popularity among American teens would note that it had not only demographically targeted users younger than 13 , but that it had also admitted illegally collecting information about them .\nFor users who might consider employing TikTok in schools\u2014and news sites\u2014around America , the inclusion of such relevant information is essential . The general tone of the piece would not have to change at all ; TikTok is , in many ways , a liberating social technology that brings much joy to the lives of millions of American teenagers . But it \u2019 s also a Chinese social media program that \u2019 s settled with the FTC for illegally collecting information on underage users , has a history of censoring user-generated content , and is now said to be under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , a governmental review panel . That national security investigation is looking into how the app sends data back to China .\nJust as any article about Facebook would be incomplete if it ignored Facebook \u2019 s history of apologies for admitted privacy violations , any article about TikTok that omits its record of censorship and illegal behavior is irresponsible .\nThis might be the juncture where TikTok and its American counterparts meet . None of the social media giants , whether American or Chinese , wants to reveal embarrassing information about how it actually conducts its work as media . Yet it seems clear all social media\u2014whether TikTok , Weibo , Facebook or Twitter\u2014privilege state or corporate authority above the public \u2019 s interest . That makes them terrific vehicles for advertising and propaganda .\nIt also means the need for independent , comprehensive and critical reporting about these apps is vital . Watching journalists vie to become \u201c TikTok famous \u201d like high school teenagers isn \u2019 t encouraging .",
