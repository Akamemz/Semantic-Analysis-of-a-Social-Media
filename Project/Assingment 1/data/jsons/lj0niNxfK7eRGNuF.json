Along with Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah , Paul has pushed for a complete repeal of the current law and did not endorse the changes the Freedom Caucus won for the House bill to weaken its insurance mandates .\nOn the other side of the Republican caucus , more moderate senators like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska criticized its deep cuts to Medicaid and a provision aimed at cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood .
