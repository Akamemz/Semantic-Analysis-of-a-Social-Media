    "content": "Two former top Obama-appointed prosecutors co-author a diatribe against Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions for returning the Justice Department to purportedly outdated , too \u201c tough on crime \u201d charging practices . Yawn . After eight years of Justice Department stewardship by Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch , and after Obama \u2019 s record 1,715 commutations that systematically undermined federal sentencing laws , we know the skewed storyline .\nThe surprise is to find such an argument in the pages of National Review Online . But there it was on Tuesday : \u201c On Criminal Justice , Sessions Is Returning DOJ to the Failed Policies of the Past , \u201d by Joyce Vance and Carter Stewart , formerly the United States attorneys for , respectively , the Northern District of Alabama and the Southern District of Ohio . Ms. Vance is now lecturing on criminal-justice reform at the University of Alabama School of Law and doing legal commentary at MSNBC . Mr. Stewart has moved on to the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation , fresh from what it describes as his \u201c leadership role at DOJ in addressing inequities in the criminal justice system , \u201d focusing on \u201c alternatives to incarceration , \u201d and \u201c reducing racial disparities in the federal system . \u201d\nThe authors lament that Sessions has reinstituted guidelines requiring prosecutors \u201c to charge the most serious offenses and ask for the lengthiest prison sentences. \u201d This , the authors insist , is a \u201c one-size-fits-all policy \u201d that \u201c doesn \u2019 t work. \u201d It marks a return to the supposedly \u201c ineffective and damaging criminal-justice policies that were imposed in 2003 , \u201d upsetting the \u201c bipartisan consensus \u201d for \u201c criminal-justice reform \u201d that has supposedly seized \u201c today \u2019 s America . \u201d\nThis is so wrongheaded , it \u2019 s tough to decide where to begin .\nIn reality , what Sessions has done is return the Justice Department to the traditional guidance articulated nearly four decades ago by President Carter \u2019 s highly regarded attorney general , Benjamin Civiletti ( and memorialized in the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Manual ) . It instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious , readily provable offense under the circumstances . Doesn \u2019 t work ? This directive , in effect with little variation until the Obama years , is one of several factors that contributed to historic decreases in crime . When bad guys are prosecuted and incarcerated , they are not preying on our communities .\nThe thrust of the policy Sessions has revived is respect for the Constitution \u2019 s bedrock separation-of-powers principle . It requires faithful execution of laws enacted by Congress .\nA concrete example makes the point . Congress has prescribed a minimum ten-year sentence for the offense of distributing at least five kilograms of cocaine ( see section 841 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( ii ) of the federal narcotics laws ) . Let \u2019 s say a prosecutor is presented with solid evidence that a defendant sold seven kilograms of cocaine . The crime is readily provable . Nevertheless , the prosecutor follows the Obama deviation from traditional Justice Department policy , charging a much less serious offense : a distribution that does not specify an amount of cocaine \u2014 as if we were talking about a one-vial street sale . The purpose of this sleight of hand is to evade the controlling statute \u2019 s ten-year sentence , inviting the judge to impose little or no jail time .\nBending statutes to the executive \u2019 s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance . We should not be surprised that his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement , too .\nThat is not prosecutorial discretion . It is the prosecutor substituting his own judgment for Congress \u2019 s regarding the gravity of the offense . In effect , the prosecutor is decreeing law , not enforcing what is on the books \u2014 notwithstanding the wont of prosecutors to admonish that courts must honor Congress \u2019 s laws as written .\nAbsent this Justice Department directive that prosecutors must charge the most serious , readily provable offense , the executive branch becomes a law unto itself . Bending congressional statutes to the executive \u2019 s policy preferences was the Obama approach to governance , so we should not be surprised that a pair of his appointed prosecutors see it as a model for criminal enforcement , too . But it is not enforcement of the law . It is executive imperialism . It is DACA all over again : \u201c Congress refuses to codify my policy preferences ; but I have raw executive power so I shall impose them by will . . . and call it \u2018 prosecutorial discretion. \u2019 \u201d ( In truth , it is a distortion of prosecutorial discretion . )\nIt should not be necessary to point out to accomplished lawyers that , in our system , \u201c bipartisan consensus \u201d is not a comparative handful of Democrats and Republicans clucking their tongues in unison . Yes , between leftist hostility to incarceration and libertarian skepticism about prosecutorial power , there is common ground among some factions of lawmakers when it comes to opposing our allegedly draconian penal code . But these factions are not much of a consensus . The only consensus that matters is one that drums up support sufficient to enact legislation into law . \u201c Criminal-justice reform \u201d is of a piece with \u201c comprehensive immigration reform \u201d and the Obama agenda : If it actually enjoyed broad popularity , resort to executive fiat would be unnecessary \u2014 Congress would codify it .\nThe criminal-justice \u201c reformers \u201d want mandatory-minimum-sentencing provisions eliminated and other sentencing provisions mitigated . Yet , despite the sympathetic airing they get from the \u201c progressive \u201d mainstream media , they are unable to get their \u201c reforms \u201d passed by Congress . How come ? Because strong majorities of lawmakers understand themselves to be accountable to commonsense citizens \u2014 people who aren \u2019 t \u201c evolved \u201d enough to grasp how reducing the number of criminals in prisons will somehow decrease the amount of crime . Most of us benighted types proceed under the quaint assumption that , even in \u201c today \u2019 s America , \u201d the streets are safer when the criminals are not on them .\nIn light of the caterwauling about mandatory-minimum sentencing by people either unfamiliar with or in a state of amnesia about what the federal system was like before it was instituted , it is worth repeating : Such provisions mean that the public , rather than the judge , decides the minimum appropriate term for serious crimes . As a class , judges are elite products of American universities and tend to be more left-leaning than the general public . That is particularly the case with respect to President Obama \u2019 s 335 judicial appointees , many of them \u2014 like Obama himself , as well as Vance and Stewart \u2014 philosophically resistant to incarceration as a response to crime . We can certainly repeal mandatory minimums , but if we do , it will vest those judges with unfettered discretion to mete out punishment . Rest assured , such sentences will not resemble the ones most of us would impose . Note also what the \u201c reformers \u201d do not tell you about mandatory minimums : ( a ) Congress has enacted a \u201c safety valve \u201d that allows a judge to waive them in cases involving first offenders whose crimes do not involve guns ; and ( b ) they can also be waived if a defendant cooperates with government investigations . By and large , mandatory minimums are applied to hardcore criminals \u2014 as one would expect , since they are mainly triggered by very large amounts of illegal narcotics and the use of firearms during violent crimes .\nIt is always worth considering whether sentencing terms are too severe \u2014 or , for that matter , insufficiently severe . Criminal statutes can be modified by legislation , which reflects the judgment of the people \u2019 s representatives . The fact that they have not been , notwithstanding the purported \u201c consensus \u201d for \u201c reform , \u201d suggests that the public is not convinced of the need for such modification \u2014 or , perhaps , that our representatives grasp the need for a check on the judges .\nUnable to change the law , the \u201c reformers \u201d are reduced to arguing that justice happens only when prosecutors ignore the law . If you \u2019 re Jeff Sessions and you say , \u201c No , you know , I think we \u2019 ll have them follow the law , \u201d you \u2019 re a Neanderthal .\nVance and Stewart persist in the mythology of federal penitentiaries overflowing with \u201c nonviolent drug offenders. \u201d They must use this deceptive term because what they \u2019 d like to be able to claim \u2014 namely , that the prisons teem with sad sacks rotting away on misdemeanor drug-possession crimes \u2014 is patently false . Federal prosecutorial resources are targeted at narcotics felonies , often involving significant distribution organizations and importation networks .\nThese schemes are inherently violent . Cocaine , heroin , and the like are illegal commodities that generate major cash transactions . Traffickers can \u2019 t go to the police when they need to protect a shipment , or sue in court when they get cheated . They therefore protect themselves by cultivating a reputation for violence \u2014 which requires liberal resort to violence . Even if an individual drug dealer happens to be unarmed when apprehended , it was the omnipresent specter of violence that enabled his enterprise to thrive . That is why , for decades , evidence of guns , ammunition , and other weaponry has been admissible to prove the existence of narcotics conspiracies \u2014 guns , federal jurisprudence teaches , are \u201c tools of the drug trade . \u201d\nIf you \u2019 re Jeff Sessions and you say , \u2018 No , you know , I think we \u2019 ll have them follow the law , \u2019 you \u2019 re a Neanderthal .\nVance and Stewart advance the now familiar prattle that what they describe as \u201c excessive reliance on arrests and extended incarceration \u201d \u2014 translation : enforcing the criminal laws against narcotics trafficking and violent crime \u2014 has \u201c disparately impacted racial minorities and the poor \u201d and is responsible for \u201c the broken relationship between police departments and the communities they are sworn to serve and protect . \u201d\nThis is unmitigated nonsense . As Heather Mac Donald has repeatedly demonstrated , based on hard evidence , the disparate impact that the enforcement of law has on racial minorities is a function of offense behavior . The brute fact is that black people , taken as a group , commit more crimes than other racial and ethnic groups . Of course , in the day-to-day work of police and prosecutors , racialized bean-counting is irrelevant . We don \u2019 t treat people as groups \u2014 it \u2019 s the Left \u2019 s agitators who want us to view people not as individuals but as members of oppressed classes . In our system , however , guilt is personal . That is real justice , not \u201c social justice . \u201d\nRegardless of the root causes , it is a remorseless fact that if you are going to enforce the laws , you necessarily will most often encounter the people who most often violate them . And you most often encounter them because they are violating the law , not because of some \u201c institutionalized \u201d bias . We know crimes are being committed not because of statisticians but because of victims . If you want to obsess over groups , maybe our sympathetic attention should shift to the prey rather than the predators \u2014 the racial minorities and poor people who by an outsize margin are victims of crime . That \u2019 s the disparate impact worth fretting over . And it is exacerbated when the laws are not enforced .\nMoreover , the relationship between police departments and the communities they serve is not broken . That is a progressive narrative that seeks to blame the higher incidence of crime in minority communities on \u201c institutional racism \u201d in the justice system . Really ? In \u201c today \u2019 s America , \u201d police departments are more integrated than at any time in history \u2014 often run by members of the minority communities that they serve . The court system is run by judges and lawyers educated in American law schools , proud ( and often activist ) members of the most politically progressive profession in our society \u2014 with the possible exception of university professors . The thought that these people would tolerate pervasive racism in their institution is laughable \u2014 or at least it should be . The reality of the system is that it bends over backward to avoid even the appearance of racism .\nOf course there are bad cops , just as there are bad people in every occupation . But there are fewer of them in policing . Law enforcement tends to draw unusually valorous recruits who want to serve their communities , and who accept that their actions will be scrutinized with a zeal unknown to other professions . In a country of over 320 million people , it is unavoidable that there will be some violent encounters between police and civilians . We should marvel , though , at how relatively rare they are . The problem we have is not that the justice system is racist ; it is that the slander that it is racist will cause police to shrink from enforcing the laws , a dereliction that would most harm minority communities .\nVance and Stewart have a point when they object to Attorney General Sessions \u2019 s unfortunate fondness for what they call \u201c adoptive forfeiture policies. \u201d As we at National Review have contended ( as has Justice Clarence Thomas , Kevin Williamson reminds us ) , civil asset forfeitures are property seizures without due process of law . A federal spoils system incentivizes police to grab with both hands . Regardless of their effectiveness against drug lords , such forfeitures should be halted \u2014 the police should be required to proceed by criminal forfeiture and prosecution , with the due-process safeguards that entails . But that is because civil forfeitures offend the Constitution , not because they feed a left-wing narrative about fractured police\u2013community relations .\nAttorney General Sessions is enforcing the law , and doing so within a noble Justice Department tradition of giving force to Congress \u2019 s expression of the public will . He is not altering the law by executive fiat , the preference of President Obama , Attorneys General Holder and Lynch , Professor Vance , Mr. Stewart , and the bipartisan minority they portray as a \u201c consensus . \u201d\nThere is a great deal I don \u2019 t like about the legal system either . Statist government has enacted far too many laws , such that the federal government has criminalized too much of what used to be the province of state regulation \u2014 or unregulated private behavior . The drug laws do have severe penalties and may work injustice in some cases \u2014 although fewer than Vance and Stewart suggest : Though the hands of federal judges are tied by mandatory minimums , they are not bound to follow advisory sentencing guidelines or prosecutorial recommendations . I would certainly be open to mitigating penalties in exchange for thinning out the federal penal code and transferring areas of enforcement responsibility back to the states . The point , however , is that this has to be done by legislation , not by executive autocrats under a stealthy distortion of prosecutorial discretion .\nIf Professor Vance and Mr. Stewart are right that we are in a new era , if the public has truly been won over to the notion that incarcerating criminals is counterproductive , the next step is very simple : Pass laws that amend the penal code . In the meantime , the Justice Department \u2019 s job is to enforce the laws we have .
