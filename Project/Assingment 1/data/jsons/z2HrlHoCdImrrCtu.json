In it , dozens of people in the quarantined city lean out of their balconies and shout , \u201c Wuhan jiayou , \u201d which is roughly translated , \u201c Wuhan keep up the fight. \u201d Markham \u2019 s mayor recorded a video in which the thousand attendees at the banquet shouted , \u201c Wuhan jiayou ! \u201d\nIn Canada , Markham \u2013 sister city to Wuhan , China \u2013 is striving to counter negative associations . In February , Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti launched an Asialicious festival in which more than 100 Asian restaurants in the Toronto area invited customers to tasting events .\nFrom Boston to Johannesburg , customers have been avoiding Chinatowns . There have been news reports of bullying , discrimination , and xenophobia against Asians . But others warn that such isolationist impulses create a sense of alienation in those communities . And some are stepping forward to practice acts of kindness and model support for Chinese businesses .\nIt \u2019 s lunchtime at New Golden Gate seafood restaurant in Boston \u2019 s Chinatown . Amid fears of the new coronavirus , just two of its tables are occupied . In a back corner , two waiters sit as listless as the lobsters inside a nearby tank .\nToday they \u2019 ve had fewer than 20 customers over three hours , says manager May Deng . \u201c At least a 90 % drop . That \u2019 s huge . \u201d\nIf business doesn \u2019 t pick up in the next two to three months , she \u2019 ll have to close . \u201c How can you survive ? \u201d says Ms. May , tears rimming her eyes .\nFrom Boston to San Francisco , London to Johannesburg , customers have been avoiding Chinatowns amid unsubstantiated fears that the virus jumped from China via these neighborhoods . There have been news reports , too , of bullying , discrimination , and xenophobia against Asians . But others warn that such isolationist impulses create a sense of alienation in those communities . And some individuals , public officials , and organizations are stepping forward to practice acts of kindness and model support for Chinese businesses .\n\u201c The virus has no nationality . The virus does not practice discrimination . Why should we , being a human being , discriminate against any ethnic group ? \u201d says Justin Yu , president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association , a business and community organization in New York City . \u201c This is a time for everybody to learn we should have sympathy . \u201d\nDeeply ingrained cultural prejudices about Chinese people as supposed carriers of disease date back further than the outbreak of SARS , says Winston Tseng , a research sociologist and lecturer of community health and human development at UC Berkeley \u2019 s School of Public Health in California . In 1899 , Honolulu forcibly quarantined its Chinatown due to fears of the bubonic plague ; the following year , San Francisco circled its Chinatown with rope for two days .\n\u201c There was an assumption ... of \u2018 the yellow peril , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Tseng . \u201c So Chinese or Japanese back then were [ viewed as ] dirty and carrying a lot of diseases . \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff May Deng , the manager of the New Golden Gate restaurant in Boston 's Chinatown , says business is down 90 % because of the coronavirus .\nToday , individuals across the world are reaching out to help Chinese and Asian businesses . In Australia , the progressive activist group GetUp ! encouraged its members to dine in Chinese restaurants and also post pictures of meals on social media with the hashtag # IWillEatWithYou . It was a response to news reports such as the closure of Shark Fin House , a three-decades-old restaurant in Melbourne \u2019 s Chinatown , says the group \u2019 s media adviser Chandi Bates . The hashtag is now popping up on Twitter and Instagram accounts in other parts of the world .\n\u201c I Will Eat With You is giving people a practical way to take a positive step , show support and solidarity to businesses that need it , all at the same time as eating a delicious meal , \u201d says Renaire Druery , campaign director for the GetUp ! Human Rights Campaign , via email .\nIn mid-February , Boston Mayor Martin Walsh started a social media campaign with the hashtag # LoveBostonChinatown . He and other city councilors organized a photo-op dim sum lunch at once-popular eatery China Pearl . In early March , there \u2019 s not a lot of foot traffic beneath the pagoda-style arch entryway into Chinatown . A nearby outdoor table of tourist trinkets remains untroubled .
