As Speaker , he committed to a \u201c bottom-up \u201d approach that empowers committees to draft and mark up these proposals .\nBut Ryan is also under enormous pressure to notch some major legislative victories for Republicans , meaning he may have to take a more hands-on role in the coming weeks to help whip votes and shepherd some bills to the finish line .\n\u201c The Speaker must have at least two substantial legislative initiatives on the president \u2019 s desk for signatures by the end of March , or the American people will start to question where Congress is and why they can \u2019 t get things done , \u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) , an ally of President Trump . Meadows , chairman of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus , is part of Ryan \u2019 s team of congressional advisers .\nPassage of a $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion supplemental spending bill to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border could happen relatively quickly .

And , of course , GOP deficit hawks may balk at the multibillion-dollar price tag of the wall , even though Trump has vowed he \u2019 ll get Mexico to reimburse the U.S .\nBefore anything else happens , Capitol Hill Republicans will try to fulfill a top campaign promise : repealing \u00adObamaCare . The House is going first , hoping to quickly pass a repeal-and-replace package and build some momentum for Senate action , but GOP fissures have already started forming in the lower chamber .\nDuring last week \u2019 s Presidents Day recess , furious constituents gave GOP lawmakers an earful at public town halls around the country , warning them to keep their hands off \u00adObamaCare . The highly publicized protests , one member predicted , could spook still-on-the-fence Republicans and derail the GOP \u2019 s efforts to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) .\nMeanwhile , Ryan \u2019 s getting pulled in the other direction by conservatives in the Freedom Caucus who \u2019 ve insisted the House take up a much tougher repeal bill from 2015 . That legislation would swiftly kill core elements of the ACA , including \u00adObamaCare taxes and Medicaid expansion \u2014 an approach that moderate House Republicans and some GOP senators see as too drastic .\nThe chatter in some conservative circles is that if the Speaker keeps pushing for a watered-down repeal bill , critics will dub it \u201c RyanCare . \u201d\n\u201c As long as the American people see us moving forward on bold conservative ideas , they will understand some items take longer than others to pass , \u201d said Rep.

GOP sources say they hope the Energy and Commerce panel can begin marking up the repeal legislation by next week . The Ways and Means Committee may not begin marking up until the week of March 13 , sources said .\nThat leaves a small window to hammer out the details , whip votes and bring the package to the floor before the end of the month . Don \u2019 t be surprised if the House and Senate votes on the repeal-and-replace package slip into early April , a GOP source said .\nComing up short on repeal would be the \u201c most devastating failure \u201d for congressional Republicans , said Tim Phillips , president of Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) , which has ties to billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch .\n\u201c They talked about it for so many years .
