    "content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton currently lead the delegate counts for the presidential nomination . But because of the difference in how both parties award their delegates , Clinton 's is the more commanding lead .\nTuesday 's Democratic contest in Michigan , the biggest prize of the day , is key for Bernie Sanders to show he can turn things around . His campaign has argued that Clinton has ballooned her lead because of black voters in the South .\nNow , many of those Southern contests are over ( though there is another Tuesday in Mississippi ) .\nBut the question remains : Can the Vermont independent senator appeal to Northern black voters ? They make up roughly a quarter of Michigan 's Democratic electorate . He believes his economic message can resonate with them and working-class whites hurt by trade . Polls , though , have shown the former secretary of state with double-digit leads going into Tuesday .\nSanders is facing a difficult problem : This past weekend , he won three of four contests , but , because his wins were in smaller caucuses , and Clinton won by a huge margin in the primary in Louisiana , Sanders only wound up winning three more pledged delegates than Clinton . ( Pledged delegates are derived from the margins candidates win in voting in various state primaries and caucuses . )\nMaintaining that kind of pace will not help Sanders catch Clinton , who is 195 delegates ahead . Sanders needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win a majority of pledged delegates . And with each passing contest , that hill becomes even steeper . With superdelegates , those unpledged party leaders and elected officials , factored in , Sanders needs a whopping 60 percent of all remaining delegates . That 's a very difficult aircraft carrier to turn around , given the Democrats ' proportional system of allocating delegates .\nYes , superdelegates can change their votes , and it 's true they have never not gone with who won the pledged majority , but even in 2008 , when Barack Obama defeated Clinton , and won more superdelegates , not all that many superdelegates peeled off from Clinton . What 's more , Clinton has a far bigger lead with them now than she ever did in 2008 . Clinton already has nearly two-thirds of all superdelegates publicly in her corner . ( And , by the way , they were created in the 1980s for precisely this purpose \u2014 to give party leaders a lever to prevent the nomination of what they view as an unelectable candidate after Democrats were soundly defeated in 1984 . )\nAll that said , the pledged-delegate margin remains the most important number to watch . Clinton would prefer to win the nomination outright based on voting \u2014 and not because party leaders put her over the top . There 's lots of talk of the GOP civil war , but if there was an outcome in which one candidate won the delegates from actual voters and the other won the nomination because of party insiders , you can bet there would be an equally ugly Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summer .\nBut unless Sanders starts winning soon and big , that 's all theoretical and moot . The Democratic race , at this point , does n't look close to heading toward anything like that .\nFor Republicans , though , Trump is ahead , his lead is less dominant because it 's a four-person race \u2014 and the candidates keep splitting the vote .\nOn Tuesday , Michigan has the most delegates in play with 59 , far less than on the Democratic side , in part because Republicans have far fewer delegates overall , but also because of the state 's history of voting Democratic .\nTrump has been leading the polls there by double digits , and he needs another big win . The other contests of the day , though \u2014 in Mississippi , Idaho and Hawaii \u2014 hold far more delegates combined ( 91 ) than Michigan . There has n't been any good polling in Mississippi , but Trump hopes to pull off a win there like he did in neighboring Louisiana over the weekend . If Louisiana is an indicator , though , Cruz could give Trump a run for his money .\nIf Cruz pulled that off , it would be yet another example that he could use to say he 's the principal alternative to Trump \u2014 and not Marco Rubio . This past weekend , Cruz , who trails Trump by 84 delegates , made a strong case for that . He won the biggest share of the delegates out of a handful of contests with wins in Kansas and Maine \u2014 and he nearly picked off Trump in Louisiana and Kentucky .\nRubio finished third everywhere on Saturday , except in Maine , where he finished fourth . He made up for it some in Puerto Rico on Sunday , winning there by such a big margin that he took all of the territory 's 23 delegates .\nThe GOP political establishment could n't think of a worse possible choice than having to pick between Trump and Cruz , who might be the least liked person in Congress among his colleagues .\nAnd then there 's John Kasich . The Ohio governor is hoping to surprise the field in Michigan . He should do well there . He 's a Midwesterner . But he 's polling double digits behind Trump , and some polls have had Cruz either in second or a close third . If Kasich is far behind in Michigan or even finishes third behind Cruz , it 's hard for him to make a case that he has a real chance at the nomination .\nHe 'll likely stay in for the winner-take-all March 15 contest in his home state of Ohio , but what 's his sell for staying in after that \u2014 aside from maybe trying to keep Trump below a majority heading into the convention by picking off votes and delegates where he can in more moderate places ?\nBecause of the crowded field , unlike the two-person race on the Democratic side , Trump currently still needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win the nomination . But he has only won the majority of delegates in five of 20 states so far .\nThat 's not to say anyone else on the GOP side has a better chance of winning a majority \u2014 Cruz needs 59 percent of all remaining delegates , Rubio 68 percent and Kasich 75 percent .\nThe candidates hope to start racking up more lopsided wins , as the contest rules change on March 15 . That 's when states can pick however they want to award delegates . Some states , like Florida , Ohio , Arizona and New Jersey , are winner take all ; others are more hybrid . All of that is to say there could be some funky results , spikes and dips ahead that could sway the race in a potentially unknown direction .\nBut clearly , at this point , Trump is in the driver 's seat . He has solid support with his hardened base that will get him a lot of delegates before June when the contests are eventually over . The question that still remains for him is : Will he grow his support ?\nThrough 20 contests , he has averaged 35 percent of the vote . He 's cracked 40 percent in five states so far and 50 percent in just one ( New Hampshire ) . That 's why he 's been publicly calling for candidates , like Rubio , to get out of the race .\nThe theory of the establishment coalescing behind a single candidate to beat Trump might not hold true , but what might be true is Trump needs the field to shrink to get a majority before the convention .\nHow many states vote ? Four : Hawaii , Idaho , Michigan and Mississippi . ( All four vote on the GOP side , but just Michigan and Mississippi vote on the Democratic side . )\nWhen do polls close ? 8 p.m . ET ( Mississippi ) , 9 p.m . ET ( Michigan \u2014 most polls close at 8 p.m . ET , but some counties are in Central ) , 11 p.m . ET ( Idaho ) , 1 a.m . ET ( Hawaii ) .\nHow many delegates are at stake ? 316 combined ( 338 if 22 Democratic superdelegates are included ) :\n-- 188 Democrats ( Michigan : 130 pledged+17 supers ; Mississippi : 36 pledged+5 supers )\n\u2014 150 Republican ( Michigan : 59 ; Mississippi : 40 ; Idaho : 32 ; Hawaii : 19 )\nRemind me what happened on Super Tuesday ?

Four: Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi.
