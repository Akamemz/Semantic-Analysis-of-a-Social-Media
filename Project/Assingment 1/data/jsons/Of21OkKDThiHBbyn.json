This comes on the heels of reporting that the Centers for Disease Control \u2019 s prevention budget has been cut by half since 2006 , and new revelations about how botched protocols at the Dallas hospital that turned away Thomas Eric Duncan and then failed to treat him effectively also led to the infection of one of Duncan \u2019 s caregivers .\nYet most of the media coverage of the politics of Ebola to date has centered on whether President Obama has adequately and/or honestly dealt with the disease . \u201c I remain concerned that we don \u2019 t see sufficient seriousness on the part of the federal government about protecting the American public , \u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters . Cruz is probably the wrong guy to talk about seriousness : his government shutdown forced the NIH to delay clinical trials and made the CDC cut back on disease outbreak detection programs this time last year .\nI find myself wondering : When , if ever , will the political debate over Ebola center on the way the right-wing libertarian approach to government has made us less safe ?\nMy fans at Newsbusters and other right-wing sites were outraged last week when I raised questions about whether Texas Gov . Rick Perry shared some responsibility for the nation \u2019 s Ebola crisis with President Obama , since the outbreak occurred in his state on his watch . Now that a second person has been infected there , I think the question is even more relevant .\nThe GOP approach to public health was crystallized at the 2012 debate where Rep. Ron Paul \u2013 another Texas politician -- said it wasn \u2019 t the government \u2019 s responsibility to take care of a hypothetical young man who showed up in the emergency room very sick after he decided not to buy insurance . \u201c That 's what freedom is all about , taking your own risks , '' Paul said , deriding `` this whole idea that you have to prepare to take care of everybody \u2026 ''\n`` Are you saying that society should just let him die ? '' moderator Wolf Blitzer asked . And the crowd roared \u201c Yeah ! \u201d ( For his part Paul answered no , but said hospitals should treat such cases as charity and not be compelled to do so . ) Lest you think either Paul or that Florida audience represented a minority sentiment in the GOP , recall that none of his rivals , not even Mitt Romneycare , challenged Paul \u2019 s approach at the debate .\nBut now we know what happens when hospitals fail to adequately care for uninsured people who turn up in the ER : They can die , which is awful , but they may also spread disease and death to many other people . It \u2019 s pragmatism , not socialism , that commits governments to a public health agenda .\nThat agenda , however , has been disowned by the modern GOP . Sarah Kliff got lots of attention for her Vox piece starkly depicting how the Centers for Disease Control \u2019 s prevention budget has been cut by more than half since 2006 . The chart she used actually came from a piece in Scientific American last week , which I hadn \u2019 t seen before . It \u2019 s must-reading : it dispassionately explained the way we \u2019 ve underfunded and degraded our public health infrastructure . And again , it made me think about the Republican policies that have hampered our ability to fight this crisis .\nIs n't there a fair way to say that cutting 45,700 public health workers at the state and local level , largely under GOP governors , was irresponsible ? As was slashing the CDC 's prevention budget by half since 2006 , or cutting the Affordable Care Act 's prevention budget by a billion ? Sen. John McCain wants an `` Ebola czar , '' but the Senate is blocking confirmation of the Surgeon General . Is n't it fair to ask whether the constant denigration of government , and the resulting defunding , now makes it harder to handle what everyone agrees are core government functions ?\nIt seems relevant to me that Texas is 33rd in public health funding . It \u2019 s clear now that not just the hospital but state and local authorities responded inadequately to Duncan \u2019 s illness .
