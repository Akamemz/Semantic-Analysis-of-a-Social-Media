    "content": "Tucson , Arizona ( CNN ) The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a lumbering , old airplane . Taking its first flight in 1975 , it was not designed for air-to-air combat like the F-15 Eagle . It 's not sleek or stealthy like the F-22 Raptor . It has never taken a leading role in Hollywood blockbusters like the F-14 Tomcat or F/A-18 Hornet .\nBut what it lacks in performance and good looks , it makes up for with pure brute punching power . If the F-15 is the Tom Brady of the Air Force , the A-10 is Lawrence Taylor . It is arguably one of the most important post-9/11 aerial fighters in the United States arsenal . It is also close to being put out to pasture .\nBetter known as the Warthog , the A-10 has fought pitched battles with Iraqi insurgents , the Taliban and more recently , ISIS fighters . But the most dangerous foe the aircraft has is budget sequestration and shifting Air Force priorities , not ground fire . As it stands , the venerable warbird is only surviving year to year and may soon be eliminated .\nBudget sequestration has put a serious strain on Air Force funds , and the Pentagon leadership thinks the A-10 is too expensive to maintain under the current spending limits when other aircraft can fill similar roles . And several congressmen involved with military allocations believe other expensive undertakings -- like finding ways to neutralize the highly deadly improvised explosive devices U.S. soldiers face in the Middle East -- are higher funding priorities .\nA AV-8B Harrier lands on board the USS Nassau on April 14 , 1999 , after a strike mission into Kosovo . The AV-8B Harrier is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing . Though production of the aircraft ceased in 2003 , the U.S. Marine Corps is looking at systems enhancements and plans to continue using Harriers well into the next decade .\nA AV-8B Harrier lands on board the USS Nassau on April 14 , 1999 , after a strike mission into Kosovo .
