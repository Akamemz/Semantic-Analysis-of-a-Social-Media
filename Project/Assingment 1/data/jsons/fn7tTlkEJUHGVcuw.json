As business owners and employees navigate the new normal , here are some of the ways they have adapted to stay operating amid a global pandemic .\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has delivered an indiscriminate blow to businesses as everything from small restaurants to multinational corporations have been forced to change how they do work amid a series of shutdown orders to help stem the tide of the virus . They have also had to implement these massive organizational changes in just a matter of weeks to attempt to stay afloat -- with many companies shifting to full-scale working from home plans and others going all in on delivery .\n`` I \u2019 ve done a couple of webinars with groups of companies .
