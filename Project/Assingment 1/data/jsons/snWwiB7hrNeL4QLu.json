    "content": "As a member of Congress more than a decade ago , Mike Pence unveiled an immigration proposal offering a chance for legal status to people who had come to the country illegally .\nTom Tancredo , then a firebrand Republican congressman from Colorado , called the vice president \u2019 s proposal both \u201c amnesty \u201d and \u201c an atrocity \u201d : A political action committee he co-founded set up a running \u201c Pence Watch \u201d online . The populist pundit Pat Buchanan likened Pence \u2019 s call for \u201c a principled consensus on immigration reform \u201d to a betrayal from \u201c The Godfather \u201d and said it could mean \u201c the end of Mike Pence as a rising star of the GOP . \u201d\nPence \u2019 s 2006 plan , which he insisted did not amount to amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally , died quietly and has been mostly forgotten in Washington .\nBut not by those hawkish advocates , who suspect that Pence is quietly seeking to have a moderating influence over President Donald Trump \u2019 s immigration policies , including what the president introduced as his new \u201c pro-immigrant \u201d plan on Thursday .\nAlthough Pence largely echoes Trump \u2019 s talking points and has given few public hints that he sees things any differently , his critics have noticed with growing alarm that he is playing a greater behind-the-scenes role in Trump \u2019 s immigration policy than has been previously understood , a fact confirmed by people close to Pence .\nImmigration hawks say Pence \u2019 s involvement is a warning sign that \u201c establishment Republicans who are interested in more workers \u2014 and not more relief for American workers \u201d \u2014 are making inroads into Trump \u2019 s policymaking , said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies , who attended a meeting with Jared Kushner , the president \u2019 s senior adviser and son-in-law .\nVaughan and her influential allies are in constant battle with what they see as Chamber of Commerce-style establishment Republicans , who are far more interested in ensuring an ample labor supply than in Trump \u2019 s themes of secure borders and national identity . That approach is at odds with the plan Trump released Thursday , which does not aim to reduce the overall number of immigrants allowed in the U.S. legally or address the illegal immigration population \u2014 issues he had rallied against for years .\nThough the latest immigration proposal was crafted by Kushner , the vice president and his staff attended discussions at the White House over the past several months as it was being shaped . Those meetings included at least two meetings between Kushner and various advocacy groups , including business and agriculture organizations , according to four people who attended the meetings . He has held at least one call with activists on immigration . More recently , he has spoken at a series of immigration events focused on securing the U.S.-Mexico border .\nPence was primarily observing when he sat in one of Kushner \u2019 s meetings earlier this year , according to an immigration activist , who supports more enforcement , though he did mention several times the plan he proposed while in the House .\nA person close to the vice president said that some themes of Pence \u2019 s old bill had been discussed as part of the new effort , while the activist also said Pence had been involved in the developmental phase of the plan and had attended other meetings more recently .\n\u201c He \u2019 s been an active participant in the discussions that Jared has led , trying to find a good balance between , for example , guest worker programs for agriculture workers , things like that , \u201d the person close to Pence said .
