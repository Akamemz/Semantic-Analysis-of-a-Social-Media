I understand how divisive it can be . I \u2019 ve seen how the left has used it to accuse opponents of their version of reform of being bigots and racists .

I , too , have felt the frustration many feel that our nation \u2019 s generosity has been taken advantage of by some .\nBut policy-making is about solving problems . And to pick the right solution , you have to weigh the realistic alternatives . Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a practical solution . But ignoring the fact that they are here is just as bad .\nFor example , passing a law that only focuses on modernization and enforcement and leaves for another day the issue of those here illegally is not a good idea .

The resulting humanitarian impact will then force us to scramble to address it . It is better to address it now as part of an orderly and measured process .\nThe only solution I know that can work is to reform legal immigration in a way that is good for the economy , do everything we can to secure the border , and allow illegal immigrants to eventually earn permanent residency by passing background checks , paying a fine , learning English and waiting at the back of the line for at least 10 years , at the same time that border security and enforcement measures are put in place to prevent this problem from happening again .\nThe bill I helped write is a good starting point , but it is not a take it or leave it proposition .
