According to the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , a watchdog group known for their representation of victims of hate groups , there are almost 900 hate groups currently operating in America \u2014 a 14 percent increase since the previous year , and the first time this number has risen since 2011 .\nThe center notes in its report that the current spike is part of a larger trend toward extremism since the turn of the century , one which sharply increased after Barack Obama was elected president in 2009 . Although the amount of hate groups stagnated and eventually began to decline five years ago , 2015 represented a sharp uptick in extremist actions and ideology across the country . There are the obvious examples : The horrific shooting in a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and the murder of nine black churchgoers in Charleston , SC by a white supremacist . But as the report notes , such instances are `` just the worst of numerous other attacks and foiled extremist plots '' that occurred in 2015 . Although , unlike the previous two examples , there 's no physical violence in this third one , I would also argue that the frankly astonishing popularity of Donald Trump \u2014 whose campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has been built upon anti-immigrant , misogynistic rhetoric \u2014 is also a sign of a shift toward more extremist views\nThe SPLC points to a variety of factors for the rise in hate groups , including immigration , the legalization of same-sex marriage , police shootings , and backlash against American Muslims in response to jihadist attacks abroad .
