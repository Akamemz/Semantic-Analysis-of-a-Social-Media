He was not asked to enter a plea and was not accompanied by an attorney . Earlier Friday , throngs of onlookers and reporters cheered as Frein was led into the building amid high security , including armored vehicles . His next court appearance has been scheduled for Nov. 12 .\nPike County District Attorney Ray Tonkin said he intends to seek the death penalty for Frein , who remains jailed without bail and has spoken to investigators since his arrest .
