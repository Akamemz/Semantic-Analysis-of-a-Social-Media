Republicans are n't cruising to a blowout in the yet-undecided Mississippi Senate race ( the special election , not the regularly-scheduled one , which Roger Wicker won easily ) as might typically be expected , but the Alabama comparisons feel strained . For starters , just a few weeks ago , the two major GOP candidates vying for the seat vacated by Sen. Thad Cochran combined to win 58 percent of the vote , compared to just 40 percent for the leading Democrat . The leading vote-getter was Cindy Hyde-Smith , the quasi-incumbent , who was appointed in the spring to temporarily serve in Cochran 's stead until the next regularly-scheduled election . Because nobody hit 50 percent of the vote , an automatic runoff was triggered . That decisive election is being held today .\nIs Hyde-Smith in danger of losing ? She has certainly made some unforced errors -- stepping on rhetorical land mines , and seeming intimidated and ill-prepared for the lone debate of the contest . Liberal groups launched a pressure campaign against corporations and large organizations who 've donated to Hyde-Smith 's campaign , notching some high-profile successes . But even the gloomiest-looking poll , a Republican internal that may have been leaked to make sure GOP voters do n't sleepwalk through this one , gave Hyde-Smith a five point lead . Another more recent poll pegs her advantage at a less-competitive ten points .\nRepublicans are painting Hyde-Smith 's opponent in the race as a corrupt liberal partisan . Mike Espy was indicted on 39 public corruption-related counts in the 1990 's , leading to his ouster from President Clinton 's cabinet , but no criminal convictions .
