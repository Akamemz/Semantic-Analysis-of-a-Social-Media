'' Pro-lifers fear that will actually happen .\nIllinois is seen as a safe haven for those seeking abortions , especially since a new law allows the state Medicaid program to fund them . Researchers on both sides of the debate have found that when taxpayers fund abortion , the numbers go up .\n`` Essentially when the price of abortion goes down the incidence increases and if low-income women can get abortion subsidized through Medicaid programs they 're more likely to get abortions , '' stated Dr. Michael New of Catholic University .\nThe Chicago Tribune reports 5,528 women traveled to Illinois last year alone from other states to have abortions .
