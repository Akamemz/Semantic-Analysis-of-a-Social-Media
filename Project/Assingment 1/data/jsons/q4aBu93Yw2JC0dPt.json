LOUIS , Missouri \u2014 It wouldn \u2019 t be Trumpian if there weren \u2019 t any fireworks .\nDonald Trump , the 2016 GOP presidential nominee , crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening \u2019 s debate at Washington University in St. Louis\u2014propelling him closer to the White House and past , perhaps , the roughest stretch of his campaign yet .\n\u201c It was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump , \u201d Jason Miller , Trump \u2019 s senior communications adviser , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in the spin room after the debate . \u201c This was a game-changing victory . You know what ? The underdog is back . \u201d\nSeveral key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night , the most important of which was when Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper and ABC News \u2019 Martha Raddatz : when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal .\nTrump held his own through six straight questions with which Raddatz and others peppered him , opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W . Bush \u2019 s nephew Billy Bus ; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again\u2014trying to force that into the conversation\u2014Trump trapped her .\n\u201c He [ Trump ] owes the president an apology , he owes our country an apology , and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words , \u201d Clinton said , regarding the birther issue .\nAfter detailing how it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative\u2014it \u2019 s been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign , as did at least two people on Clinton \u2019 s campaign\u2014Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails .\n\u201c But when you talk about apology , I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted , and that you acid washed , and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing , \u201d Trump said , before dropping the mega-bomb : a special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton .\n\u201c And I \u2019 ll tell you what . I didn \u2019 t think I \u2019 d say this , but I \u2019 m going to say it , and I hate to say it . But if I win , I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies , so much deception . There has never been anything like it , and we \u2019 re going to have a special prosecutor , \u201d Trump said , adding :\nWhen I speak , I go out and speak , the people of this country are furious . In my opinion , the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious . There has never been anything like this , where emails \u2014 and you get a subpoena , you get a subpoena , and after getting the subpoena , you delete 33,000 emails , and then you acid wash them or bleach them , as you would say , very expensive process . So we \u2019 re going to get a special prosecutor , and we \u2019 re going to look into it because you know what ? People have been \u2014 their lives have been \u2014 destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you \u2019 ve done . And it \u2019 s a disgrace . And honestly , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .\nAfter Clinton accused Trump of \u201c lies \u201d without detailing any , and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her , she begged the so-called \u201c fact checkers \u201d for help .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country , \u201d she added .\nIn response , Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year : \u201c Because you \u2019 d be in jail . \u201d\nAnother key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems . Hillary Clinton , in her previous answer\u2014in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member\u2014had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again . Trump , in his reply to Raddatz \u2019 s question , flipped the whole thing back on Clinton\u2014who , unlike Trump , supported the war in Iraq .\n\u201c First of all , Captain Khan is an American hero , and if I were president at that time , he would be alive today because , unlike her , who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing , I would not have had our people in Iraq . Iraq was a disaster , \u201d Trump said . \u201c So he would have been alive today . \u201d\n\u201c The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world , \u201d Trump continued . \u201c Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands\u2026 \u201d\n\u201c And why did it morph into that ? No , did you \u2014 no , answer the question . Do you still believe\u2026 \u201d Raddatz asked over Trump \u2019 s talking .\n\u201c Why don \u2019 t you interrupt her ? You interrupt me all the time , \u201d Trump asked Raddatz , speaking directly at the moderator .\nThe moderators interrupted Trump 26 times\u2014and Clinton only 12 times\u2014a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors .\n\u201c Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands ? \u201d Raddatz interjected again .\nWe are going to areas like Syria where they \u2019 re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama . And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama . People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are , where they are from , what their feelings about our country is , and she wants 550 percent more . This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time . We have enough problems in this country . I believe in building safe zones . I believe in having other people pay for them , as an example , the Gulf states , who are not carrying their weight , but they have nothing but money , and take care of people . But I don \u2019 t want to have , with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on , hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them . We know nothing about their values , and we know nothing about their love for our country .\nThere were many other moments throughout the debate\u2014from exchanges on Obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with Russia and Syria and even campaign finance\u2014and Trump defeated Clinton on all of them . After the moderators could not stump Trump in the opening , and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum , she could not catch a break all night .\nTrump \u2019 s debate victory\u2014which comes after a rough first debate with Clinton back on September 26 , an eternity ago in this race , and Indiana Gov . Mike Pence \u2019 s win last Tuesday in Virginia in the vice presidential debate against Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-VA ) \u2014puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him . A videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on Friday , and jittery establishment Republicans showed initial signs of a full-scale collapse of support for him . That was followed by an apology video late Friday night from Trump , a WikiLeaks document dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta \u2019 s personal emails , a rough-and-tumble , but effective , showing from several women who have accused Bill Clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them , and now this debate performance . With each of those developments and more , Trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position\u2014riding high into political battle\u2014moving into the final month of the campaign .\nThe videotape threatened to derail Trump \u2019 s campaign , as it prompted several senior Republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else .
