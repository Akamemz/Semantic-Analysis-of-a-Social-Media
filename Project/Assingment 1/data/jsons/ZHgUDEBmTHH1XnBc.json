He believed in peace .\nHere was my introduction to the divide between Red and Blue America , which ran straight through our house : Dad , the son of Nixon Republicans , a Navy veteran , a small businessman ; and Mom , the social worker from blue collar Waterbury , Connecticut , the daughter of a nurse who unionized the city hospital .\nIt was also my introduction to Jimmy Carter , whose presidency is part of the foundation of the deep and intractable political divide we know today .\nTo the right , to Red America , it \u2019 s an essential ingredient in the legend of Ronald Reagan .

So for Ronald Reagan to rescue America , he couldn \u2019 t just follow a disappointing president \u2013 he had to follow the Worst President Ever .\nTo the left , to Blue America , the Carter presidency is a different kind of tragedy . The kind of tragedy where a swirl of crises and misfortune totally beyond the control of one mere president creates an opening for an extreme ideologue who couldn \u2019 t get elected under any normal circumstance to seize power and pull the country sharply \u2013 and in many ways permanently \u2013 to the right .\nJimmy Carter is now the longest surviving ex-president in American history . It \u2019 s been 34 \u00bd years since he left the White House . They \u2019 ve been busy years for him , busy in ways we don \u2019 t usually see with former presidents \u2013 tireless humanitarian work around the globe , provocative and controversial books , churned out at the dizzying rate of almost one a year , jarringly frank public comments about his successors , about the state of the world .\nJimmy Carter \u2019 s post-presidency has in many ways been as polarizing as his presidency . But one of the worst things about polarization is that it reduces every public figure to a boring two-dimensional caricature \u2013 a champ or chump , never any in between . But with any leader and with any person it \u2019 s the in between that \u2019 s invariably the most interesting \u2013 the heroic traits and grand ambitions mixing with weaknesses , blind spots and all the imperfections that make us human .\nJimmy Carter is 90 years old now and we learned this week that he \u2019 s sick . But he \u2019 s still here and as long as he is , maybe now we can put aside all those decades of caricaturing and salute the goodness and decency that \u2019 s always been right there in front of us . Whatever you think of his politics , of his presidency , of any provocative pronouncement he \u2019 s made , Jimmy Carter is an honest man who loves his country and his family , who speaks his mind , who believes in peace and lives the biblical edict to serve the least among us .
