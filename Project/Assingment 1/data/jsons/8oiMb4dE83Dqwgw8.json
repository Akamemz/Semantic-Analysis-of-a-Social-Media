    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nDated But Relevant : \u201c The framers understood the potential corrosive influence of commercial profit in the executive and wrote the Constitution \u2018 against a background of profound concern \u2019 regarding \u2018 possible foreign influence upon the president ( and , to be sure , upon other federal officials ) \u2019 ... They designed the Emoluments Clauses as a prophylactic measure to prevent actual corruption and the specter of corruption \u2014 where a foreign power ( or a domestic government ) buys favorable policy decisions by engaging with the head of the executive branch commercially , outside the normal avenues of state\u2026 the framers developed [ the clauses ] as a bulwark against corruption in the highest office in the land. \u201d Karl A. Racine , Brian E. Frosh and Norman L. Eisen , New York Times\nSome note , \u201c National Rifle Association leaders have told Trump that he \u2019 d lose the support of gun owners if he threw his weight behind universal background checks . This helps explain why he \u2019 s backed down after calling for stricter background checks in the immediate aftermath of multiple mass shootings . This weekend , Trump nixed plans to host the G-7 summit at his Doral golf club not because it gave Democrats fodder for an article of impeachment but because key Republicans told him they couldn \u2019 t defend it . The president appears to be repeating this pattern with Syria . These are all illustrations that conservative lawmakers have more leverage over the White House than they seem to think , especially with impeachment votes looming. \u201d James Hohmann , Washington Post\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question hosting the G-7 would have financially benefited the president , who has famously refused to surrender his interest in his own company . Even if the resort rented out rooms at a reduced rate or at cost , that \u2019 s income it otherwise would not have received if the rooms were sitting empty during Miami \u2019 s slow summer season . There \u2019 s also the publicity and prestige associated with having world leaders gathering for several days at a resort that reportedly has been struggling since Trump was elected\u2026 \u201c There is a great deal of behavior that may be immoral , unethical or sleazy \u2014 and impeachable \u2014 without violating the criminal law . Trump has been enriching himself through the presidency from day one . He routinely brings his entire White House entourage to his own resorts at taxpayer expense . Foreign dignitaries snap up rooms in his Washington hotel \u2014 and sometimes don \u2019 t even use them . In truth , the Doral summit would have been simply the same misconduct on a grander scale . But as a particularly stark example of pure corruption , it ended up being something this White House rarely encounters : a bridge too far. \u201d Randall D. Eliason , Washington Post\n\u201c These nonstop conflicts mean that , for virtually every decision the president makes , from foreign policy to tax policy to environmental regulations , we need to wonder whether the president is acting in the best interest of the American people or of his own bottom line . Could his recent decision to essentially allow Turkey to invade Syria and rout longtime U.S. allies have been influenced by the many visits that Turkish officials have made to Trump properties or the large Trump-branded complex in Istanbul ? It \u2019 s outrageous that we even have to ask\u2026 \u201c The president should not get any credit for backing down . The selection of his property for a key international conference was an intolerable abuse . Ethics watchdogs were hardly alone in making that clear before the decision was made . He made it anyway . Bowing to the reality that this abuse would not be tolerated is hardly praiseworthy . You don \u2019 t get credit for doing the right thing only after being shamed for doing the wrong thing . \u201d Noah Bookbinder , USA Today\n\u201c Trump is the first president in decades to refuse to divest from his business empire . He \u2019 s argued the fact that he has placed his financial holdings in a trust that he can access whenever he chooses protects him from conflicts of interest , but his critics argue his continuing to benefit from his hotels and resorts opens the door to corruption\u2026 Last week , Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey , ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , estimated members of 22 different foreign governments have spent money at Trump resorts . Ethics experts at CREW put that number at 111 officials from 65 foreign governments . CREW has also tallied 630 visits to Trump properties from hundreds of administration officials and tracked $ 5.9 million in spending from political groups at the resorts. \u201d Riley Beggin , Vox\n\u201c This is the season of the Trump administration \u2019 s flip-flops\u2026 He allowed an invasion , then fumed when it happened . He said he was bringing the troops home , then said he \u2019 d leave them in place . The flip-flops aren \u2019 t just in matters of foreign policy , and the G7 reversal wasn \u2019 t even the only U-turn to emerge from Mulvaney \u2019 s press briefing Thursday . Asked whether the United States had demanded a quid pro quo from the Ukrainian government\u2014investigate a phantom conspiracy theory about the 2016 election in exchange for American aid\u2014Mulvaney said it sure had . \u2018 We do that all the time with foreign policy , \u2019 he said . Within hours , Mulvaney had issued a statement denying that he \u2019 d said what he \u2019 d said\u2026 Donald Trump \u2019 s administration has beat a hasty retreat from the mountains of \u2018 Get over it \u2019 to the deserts of \u2018 Never mind. \u2019 \u201d David A. Graham , The Atlantic\nThe right is divided about hosting the summit at Doral , and argues that the emoluments clause of the Constitution does not apply to the President .\nThe right is divided about hosting the summit at Doral , and argues that the emoluments clause of the Constitution does not apply to the President .\n\u201c Half of the media freak-outs in the Trump era are unwarranted . Trump responds to most media freak-outs by doubling down and digging in , refusing to give an inch . On Doral , though , Trump was wrong . And he was right to give in to his critics for a change\u2026 Trump should be avoiding even the appearance of corruption and self-dealing . The bargaining advantage of hosting the event on \u2018 home turf \u2019 simply isn \u2019 t worth taking an action that raises doubts about government integrity in the eyes of millions of voters . \u201d\n\u201c Even if the place is absolutely perfect \u2014 so good that it will have other world leaders backing Washington \u2019 s position on everything \u2014 it \u2019 s still the president \u2019 s resort\u2026 When you become leader of the Free World , there are some things you have to give up , including any hint of promoting your own properties . It \u2019 s not the obscure issue of \u2018 emoluments , \u2019 nor the folks who ( as Mulvaney put it ) \u2018 will never get over the fact that it \u2019 s a Trump property \u2019 that you have to think about\u2026 It \u2019 s that voters expect and deserve clear signs that their president is working for them \u2014 not promoting himself . \u201d\nOthers argue , \u201c There \u2019 s no denying the fact that if the Doral had been booked for the summit in a \u2018 business as usual \u2019 fashion it could , at least in theory , put some extra cash from foreign world leaders in the Trump family \u2019 s coffers\u2026 But the Doral could have offered to host the event without charging the visiting world leaders anything and written their expenses off as a loss . The prestige of hosting the event would likely still be more than enough for them\u2026 Some sort of deal along those lines would have swung the ball back into Trump \u2019 s court , allowing him to justifiably claim that he was saving the taxpayer \u2019 s money . Going to Camp David is going to run up a bill footed by the voters\u2026\n\u201c It \u2019 s not as if these summits haven \u2019 t been held in posh , privately owned locations on a regular basis . Last year when Justin Trudeau was hosting , the event was held at Hotel Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu , a world-class , luxury resort in Quebec . And while Trudeau may not own the resort personally , if you don \u2019 t think the actual owners aren \u2019 t players on the political field you \u2019 re fooling yourself . \u201d\n\u201c Trump has a style that many , including me , feel lacks manners and basic standards of propriety , but he always has . He got elected because of it , not in spite of it . Of course he wants to lord his giant resort over the head of everyone he meets at the G7 . What , are we supposed to be shocked by this ? This is what he was elected to do . And that \u2019 s the point . Trump was elected to shake things up , to take Angela Merkel into a gaudy ballroom and proudly tell her that he personally approved every chandelier there . He is meant to bask in his own glory as a proxy for our nation \u2019 s and remind the other powers just who exactly they are talking to . \u201d\n\u201c Much of the commentary on Trump \u2019 s business and the presidency feels something like Schrodinger 's corruption : Trump is both enriching himself with his office while simultaneously growing poorer . Most of his diminishing returns are pretty directly a result of that very office , and it \u2019 s helpful to take a step back from all the headlines and see what \u2019 s really under the financial hood when making such claims about a sitting president\u2026\n\u201c The quickest [ measure ] to ascertain , and the one Trump is most sensitive to and prone to brag about , is his net worth . It has plummeted from the $ 4.5 billion it was in 2015 , before his campaign announcement , all the way to approximately $ 3 billion today , something that can largely be attributed to Trump 's diminishing property values . There has been a precipitous 33 % fall since the decision to go from citizen Trump , to candidate , and then president\u2026 an objective assessment of the actual dollars and cents behind it shows that either Trump is really lousy at [ using the presidency to enrich himself ] , or he is attempting to do no such thing . \u201d\nDated But Relevant : \u201c The President is not subject to the Foreign Emoluments Clause\u2026 In 1791 , President George Washington received , accepted , and kept a diplomatic gift \u2014 a framed full-length portrait of King Louis XVI from the French ambassador to the United States . There is no evidence that Washington ever sought or received congressional consent to keep this valuable gift\u2026 President Thomas Jefferson received a bust of Czar Alexander I , a diplomatic gift , from the Russian government\u2026 Jefferson also received presents from Indian tribes , which he considered \u2018 diplomatic gifts \u2019 from foreign nations\u2026\n\u201c What all these presents from foreign states had in common was that the presidential recipients believed ( as best as we can tell ) that keeping the presents had no constitutional implications under the Foreign Emoluments Clause\u2026 The phrase at issue here \u2014 \u2018 Office \u2026 under the United States \u2019 \u2014 had a long-established pedigree . There is every good reason to conclude that , because \u2018 office \u2026 under the United States \u2019 in the 1790 Act ( and in other subsequent federal statutes ) could not have reached elected officials , the same language in the Constitution does not reach elected officials , such as the president . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
