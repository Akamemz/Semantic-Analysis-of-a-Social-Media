    "content": "Hillary Clinton garnered more than 800,000 votes from noncitizens on Nov. 8 , an approximation far short of President Trump \u2019 s estimate of up to 5 million illegal voters but supportive of his charges of fraud .\nPolitical scientist Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Virginia , has worked with colleagues to produce groundbreaking research on noncitizen voting , and this week he posted a blog in response to Mr. Trump \u2019 s assertion .\nBased on national polling by a consortium of universities , a report by Mr. Richman said 6.4 percent of the estimated 20 million adult noncitizens in the U.S. voted in November . He extrapolated that that percentage would have added 834,381 net votes for Mrs. Clinton , who received about 2.8 million more votes than Mr. Trump .\nMr. Richman calculated that Mrs. Clinton would have collected 81 percent of noncitizen votes .\n\u201c Is it plausible that non-citizen votes added to Clinton \u2019 s margin ? Yes , \u201d Mr. Richman wrote . \u201c Is it plausible that non-citizen votes account for the entire nation-wide popular vote margin held by Clinton ? Not at all . \u201d\nStill , the finding is significant because it means noncitizens may have helped Mrs. Clinton carry a state or finish better than she otherwise would have .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s unverified accusation to congressional leaders this week , as reported by The Washington Post , has sent the issue skyward .\nHe apparently was referring to all types of fraud , such as the \u201c dead \u201d voting or multiple votes from the same person . But the thrust of his estimate appears to be that illegal immigrants and noncitizens carried the popular vote .\nHe returned to the issue Thursday in Philadelphia , where he spoke to congressional Republicans mapping this year \u2019 s legislative calendar .\n\u201c We also need to keep the ballot box safe from illegal voting , \u201d the president said . \u201c And , believe me , you take a look at what \u2019 s registering , folks . Take a look at what \u2019 s registering . We are going to protect the integrity of the ballot box , and we are going to defend the votes of the American citizen , so important . \u201d\nThe mainstream media reacted to Mr. Trump \u2019 s assertion with derision . Liberal pundits said there is no evidence of fraud .\nCNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper called it \u201c a stunning allegation for which the White House is providing no evidence . And there is a reason they are providing no evidence \u2014 there is no evidence . It is not true . \u201d\nEsquire.com said , \u201c The most bizarre lie of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency so far is his claim of widespread voter fraud in an election he won . \u201d\nBut conservative activists say the liberal media are ignoring evidence \u2014 that noncitizen voting is illegal and , thus , fraud . They say the Justice Department in the Obama administration was more concerned with preventing states from cleansing rosters of dead and inactive voters than in mounting any investigation into fraud .\n\u201c Most voters are never asked for voter ID , so it is dishonest to suggest that with the tens of millions of illegal and legal aliens here , there is no voter fraud , \u201d said Tom Fitton , who heads the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch . \u201c If the key Old Dominion study results on the 2008 election are applied to 2016 \u2014 1.41 million aliens may have voted illegally , with 1.13 million voting for Democrats . \u201d\n\u201c A federal voter fraud investigation is long overdue , \u201d Mr. Fitton said . \u201c It would be a simple matter of analyzing voter registration databases against federal databases of aliens and deceased individuals . Why is the left afraid to even ask the questions ? The jig is up . \u201d\nThere does not appear to be any concerted postelection effort by states to take on the daunting task of checking voter rolls and ballots to verify citizenship . In some states , no ID is required to register and vote .\nIn the absence of detailed accounting , the only scientific way to make an estimate is by post-vote polling .\nMr. Richman relies on a one-of-a-kind poll : the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey .

Chattha and David C. Earnest \u2014 took these answers , did further research and extrapolated that of a 19.4 million estimate of adult noncitizens , about 620,000 were illegally registered to vote in the 2008 presidential election . Using other measuring tools , they said , the actual number of noncitizen voters could be as low as 38,000 and as high as 2.8 million .\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2012 that there are 22 million noncitizens in the country .
