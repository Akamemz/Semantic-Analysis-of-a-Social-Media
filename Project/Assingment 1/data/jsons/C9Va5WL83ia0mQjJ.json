And they had a big fat target .\nBuzzFeed , a pop culture site with an overlay of news , is not exactly friendly to Trump . In fact , Smith told his staff in a 2015 memo that it \u2019 s \u201c entirely fair to call him a mendacious racist , as the politics team and others have reported clearly and aggressively : he 's out there saying things that are false , and running an overtly anti-Muslim campaign. \u201d This , said Smith , was fact , not opinion .\nTrump called BuzzFeed \u201c a failing piece of garbage \u201d that is going to \u201c suffer the \u201c consequences \u201d of its actions . Sean Spicer called it \u201c frankly outrageous \u201d and a \u201c highly irresponsible \u201d decision by a \u201c left-wing \u201d blog . Mike Pence blamed it on \u201c media bias. \u201d The decision to have the incoming vice president and press secretary denounce the website before Trump spoke -- with Reince Priebus doing the same on the morning shows -- underscores how they viewed this as a prime opportunity to discredit the press .\nSmith told MSNBC \u2019 s Chuck Todd last night , \u201c When you have an object that \u2019 s in play \u2026 you do have to ask the question , why should I suppress that ? \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s worth noting that Trump also said this : \u201c I want to thank a lot of the news organizations , some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news , and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station . \u201d\nThe furor began Tuesday when anchor Jake Tapper said the following : \u201c A CNN exclusive .
