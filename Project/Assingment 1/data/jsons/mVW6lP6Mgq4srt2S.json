There is \u201c a very strong bipartisan consensus in Washington that India really is a strategic partner . \u201d\nWhat is enticing a president notoriously impatient with long-distance overseas travel to visit next week may just be the promise of throngs of well-wishers along his motorcade route and a Bollywood-worthy event with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a stadium of 100,000 cheering fans .\nNever mind that it stands at the center of his administration \u2019 s Indo-Pacific strategic vision for countering a rising China across Asia . Or that the level of diplomatic and defense cooperation between the world \u2019 s two largest democracies has approached that of other key non-NATO allies .\nAccording to recent international polling , India , with its 1.3 billion people , is one of the few countries in the world where positive views of President Donald Trump outweigh negative assessments .\nBy almost any measure , the Trump administration has elevated India in the hierarchy of U.S. strategic relationships to a level envisioned but never attained under recent administrations .\nOn the eve of President Donald Trump \u2019 s trip to India next week , the South Asian country stands at the center of his administration \u2019 s Indo-Pacific strategic vision for cementing U.S. influence and countering a rising China across Asia .\nUnder President Trump , the United States has joined with India to begin fashioning an infrastructure development alternative to China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative for a booming Asia . Diplomatic and defense cooperation between the world \u2019 s two largest democracies has advanced to a level approaching that of other key non-NATO allies .\nPerhaps most gratifying to India , the U.S. no longer sees the relationship primarily through the lens of the India-Pakistan confrontation .\n\u201c There was a time when a Pakistan visit would have been an automatic part \u201d of any American leader \u2019 s trip to India , says Jeff Smith , South Asia research fellow at the Heritage Foundation \u2019 s Asian Studies Center in Washington . Mr. Trump \u2019 s trip to India only , with no reflexive Pakistan stop , \u201c is a sign we \u2019 ve de-hyphenated the relationship . \u201d\nYet none of that may be the central reason a president notoriously impatient with long-distance overseas travel will make a trip to India beginning Sunday that will have him in the air almost as much time as on the ground .\nInstead , the showman in Mr. Trump appears to have been enticed by plans for a Bollywood-worthy event with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a stadium of 100,000 cheering fans \u2013 bigger by far than any of the president \u2019 s recent \u201c Keep America Great \u201d rallies .\nAdd to that the promise of a motorcade route lined with 7 million waving well-wishers \u2013 Mr. Trump keeps repeating that 7 million figure in amazement , although it is not clear exactly where it came from \u2013 and it becomes evident why the president is making India his showcase foreign travel of a year otherwise largely dedicated to his reelection campaign .\nIndeed India , with its 1.3 billion people , is one of the few countries in the world \u2013 Israel may be another \u2013 where positive views of Mr. Trump outweigh negative assessments , according to recent international polling .\nThat , together with the ebullient reception that the visiting Indian leader and his host received from thousands of Indian Americans at last year \u2019 s \u201c Howdy , Modi ! \u201d rally in Houston , appears to have convinced Mr. Trump that India will be his kind of place .\n\u201c Prime Minister Modi will make an extra effort on great optics , \u201d says Tanvi Madan , director of the Brookings Institution \u2019 s India Project in Washington . \u201c He \u2019 ll want to be sure that President Trump , whom they see as transactional , feels like he got something \u201d from the trip , she adds .\nShowing American presidents the love is nothing new for India , Ms. Madan notes . She says President Dwight Eisenhower spoke to a throng of a half-million people during his visit in 1959 , and that President George W. Bush \u2013 like Mr. Trump not generally loved internationally \u2013 was received enthusiastically in 2006 .\nStill , she says there will not be 7 million people lining the streets for Mr. Trump , \u201c but there will be a lot , \u201d and the Indians are confident that , \u201c if there are a lot of people , the president will be pleased . \u201d\nYet even if the U.S. public \u2019 s takeaway is a spectacle rivaling anything India has ever staged for a U.S. president , many regional analysts say the visit at its core is about solidifying the great strides the U.S.-India relationship has taken over the last decade in particular .\n\u201c This trip really is about continuity , \u201d says Bruce Riedel , a former CIA South Asia analyst and counterterrorism expert and now a senior fellow at Brookings .

Heritage \u2019 s Mr. Smith says he was \u201c frankly surprised \u201d that negotiators failed to deliver a deal that Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi could sign in New Delhi .
