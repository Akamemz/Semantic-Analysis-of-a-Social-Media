    "content": "The House on Wednesday approved a nearly $ 100 billion-a-year farm bill that would make small reductions in the growth of food stamp spending while continuing generous subsidies for the nation 's farmers .\nThe vote was 251-166 . The five-year bill now goes to the Senate for final approval .\nLeaders scheduled a quick vote after the nearly 1,000-page bill was introduced Monday , giving opponents little time to build opposition .\nAgriculture Committee chairman , Rep. Frank Lucas , R-Okla. , and Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow , D-Mich. , have spent the past two years crafting a bill to appeal to members from all regions of the country , including a boost in money for crop insurance popular in the Midwest ; higher rice and peanut subsidies for Southern farmers ; and renewal of federal land payments for Western states .\nSome House conservatives were not happy with the new bill . They originally wanted to dial back food stamp spending by $ 4 billion a year ; the new bill cuts $ 800 million a year -- which represents about 1 percent of the $ 80 billion-a-year program .\nThe final food stamp savings are generated by ending a practice in some states of boosting individual food stamp benefits by giving people a minimal amount of federal heating assistance they do n't need . The cuts were brought down to $ 800 million a year to come closer to the Senate version of the bill , which had $ 400 million in annual food stamp cuts . The House bill passed in September would have cut $ 4 billion a year .\nThe legislation would also eliminate a $ 4.5 billion-a-year farm subsidy called direct payments , which are paid to farmers whether they farm or not . The bill would continue to heavily subsidize major crops -- corn , soybeans , wheat , rice and cotton -- while shifting many of those subsidies toward more politically defensible insurance programs . That means farmers would have to incur losses before they received a payout .\nThe bill would save around $ 1.65 billion annually overall , according to the Congressional Budget Office . The amount was less than the $ 2.3 billion annual savings the agriculture committees originally projected for the bill .",
