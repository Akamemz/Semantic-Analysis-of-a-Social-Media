I had been to Afghanistan two years earlier , and concluded then the Afghan War wasn \u2019 t going as advertised . I wanted to see what progress had been made with the surge .

He acknowledged the ground war was winding down , and going forward the war would be fought with special operations forces and drones . He would be interested in just two jobs , implying that those were the Chairman of the JCS and head of the CIA . He said the CIA job would allow him to continue that fight .
