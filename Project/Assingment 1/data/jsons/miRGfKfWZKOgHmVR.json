John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can begin denying asylum-seekers entry into the U.S. if they came to the country by passing through a third country and did not first seek asylum there. The ruling overturns a federal court injunction first issued in July that put a halt to a policy that targets Central American migrants\u2014predominantly from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador\u2014who arrive at the southern border without having sought asylum in Mexico, or any third country, first.\n\nThe Supreme Court stay means the Trump administration can now begin implementing its new asylum policy while legal challenges make their way through the courts. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s policy is a dramatic change in the way the federal government treats those seeking safe haven in the United States , and is one of the administration\u2019s most significant efforts to deter migrants at the southern border,\u201d the Washington Post notes.\n\nThe legal challenges to the Trump asylum policy are expected to return to the Supreme Court for a full hearing, but that process could take many months before the court has heard and ruled on the legality of the procedure.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in dissent. \u201cOnce again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201c[T]he rule the Government promulgated topples decades of settled asylum practices and affects some of the most vulnerable people in the Western Hemisphere \u2026 .\u201d The dissent found that the court should have respected the lower, federal district court decision to grant an injunction based on its finding that the organizations bringing the suit against the government were likely to prevail.
