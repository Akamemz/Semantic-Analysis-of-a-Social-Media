    "content": "Donald Trump is going to become president next January ( sorry , Hamilton Electors ) , and he 'll be working with a Republican majority in both houses of Congress ( Congreff ? ) .\nFrom a libertarian perspective , there are some grounds for cautious optimism , but there are more reasons to be deeply worried by all this . Trump sounded distinctly authoritarian notes during the campaign and he 's no fan of free speech , free trade , and anything remotely resembling open borders . On foreign policy , he 's bounced back and forth from straightforward denunciations of 21st century interventions into the Middle East and North Africa as terrible and bragging that he 'd `` bomb the shit '' out of ISIS . Which Trump will show up on January 20 ? Who knows ? His tax plan would make national debt massively bigger and he 's hardly a fiscal hawk , either . His daughter is already making calls to push a taxpayer-funded maternity-leave program and his infrastructure plans , vague as they are , have boondoggle written all over them .\nSo who is going to stand up to him ?

Too busy pushing for higher national minimum wages during a crap economy and lobbying for student-loan relief for the relatively small number of in-debt brats of a middle-class too dumb or insecure to send their kids to relatively inexpensive state schools , I guess .
