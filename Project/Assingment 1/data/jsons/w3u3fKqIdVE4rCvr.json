    "content": "Congress now appears likely to reach a budget deal to keep the government functioning without treating as bargaining chips hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children . It also appears , though , that President Trump will consider undoing his threat of deportation for these young \u201c Dreamers \u201d only if Congress considers the first deep cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s .\nThe changes the president is demanding stem from a nativist , zero-sum view that what \u2019 s good for immigrants is bad for America . That view runs counter not just to the best of American tradition and principles , but to evidence of what \u2019 s best for the country .\nThe programs targeted by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane . One is the lottery system that offers the chance for visas to people from countries that are underrepresented as sources of American immigrants ; the other is family-based immigration , which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents .\nMr. Trump , who has regularly smeared immigrants as terrorists and criminals , has lately been focusing his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program . Last month , his Department of Homeland Security released a report that dishonestly claimed that those who entered the country via the lottery were more likely to be tied to terrorist attacks . The Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders actually killed only eight of 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975 . The immigrants chosen in the lottery , moreover , are not chosen \u201c without any regard for skill , merit or the safety of our people , \u201d as Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address . They must have at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work , and they must also undergo criminal , national security and medical checks . The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence , only a chance at getting through the rest of the immigration process .",
