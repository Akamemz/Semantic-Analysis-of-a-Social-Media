Sanders swept back into the state as the early front runner after raising $ 18 million in 41 days during the first quarter of the year , the most of any candidate . O \u2019 Rourke raised $ 9.4 million in 18 days .\nIn dueling rallies , town halls and house parties , they spoke most of improving health care and affording college tuition .\nOther hopefuls fanned out to political hot spots elsewhere , with much the same mission : Gauging early strength in a crowded field and raising enough money to secure a coveted spot in the presidential debates that begin in June .\n\u201c I \u2019 d be happy with any of \u2018 em , to be honest , \u201d the president said of the Democratic derby .\nIowa Democrats know Sanders , the Vermont senator who lost the state - and the Democratic presidential nomination - to Hillary Clinton in 2016 . At two town halls in counties he won during that caucus fight , Sanders \u2019 questioners asked most about making health care more affordable .\nOver and over , people told Sanders grim stories about medical bills putting them deeply in debt . He empathized , at one point putting an arm around a young woman who had begun weeping as she spoke . Sanders told his audience that he supports \u201c Medicare for All \u201d and a single-payer health care system . But he didn \u2019 t get into specifics .\nShannon Abel , a 28-year-old coordinator at a nonprofit organization in Muscatine , Iowa , said she still liked what she heard from Sanders .

He said the tens of thousands in debt that students carry when they graduate \u201c is a weight that literally sinks them into the ground . \u201d\nTo solve the problem , he offered a number of proposals to help students \u201c stop digging the hole \u201d and stop taking on debt when they go for a college degree : Making community college free , allowing students to earn an associate degree while they \u2019 re in high school so they \u2019 re \u201c ready to earn a living wage on day one , \u201d increase access to union apprenticeships . For those already saddled with student loan debt , O \u2019 Rourke said he \u2019 d like to \u201c re-up the public service student debt forgiveness program \u201d - a federal program that currently accepts only a fraction of applicants and is eliminated altogether in President Donald Trump \u2019 s latest budget proposal .\nIf students are willing to work in in-demand jobs at places like the Department of Veterans Affairs , or \u201c willing to teach school or be in a support role in a community that needs your talent and human capital , I want to wipe clean your student loan debt . At a minimum I want to refinance what you have at a much lower rate . \u201d\nSanders says he wants to make college free and pay for it by getting rid of tax havens and lowering taxes for the richest Americans .\nThat \u2019 s been received with some skepticism among budget and deficit hawks . But to Trevor Meyers , 19 , it sounds right .\nMeyers , like Sanders , is a democratic socialist .
