    "content": "You probably read yesterday about the efforts of John Boehner and the Republican leadership in the House to convince the rank-and-file members that shutting down the government until Obamacare is defunded is a Bad Idea , and not a Brilliant Political Maneuver . Robert Costa 's account in the National Review has the basic narrative . It looks , now , like Boehner has succeeded in defusing the shutdown threat . All he had to do was promise something worse . Now we are going to not raise the debt ceiling instead .\nAs Jonathan Chait points out , replacing the shutdown threat with a default threat is actually much crazier and more potentially disastrous . But Boehner could n't get Republicans to agree to just give up on defunding Obamacare this year . He had to promise to exchange their one crazy plan to do so with another one that will go into effect later . And when it is time for that one to go into effect , he will need to find something else to distract them for a little while , until the next crazy plan is ready to go . As Brian Beutler says , we 've seen this play out over and over again . Boehner has to promise to let Republicans do some apocalyptic thing later in order to get them to avoid doing some apocalyptic thing now . So far we 've avoided an apocalypse .\nBut the people Boehner is trying to deal with here do n't see any of these threats as particularly apocalyptic . They do n't really see anything at all that might contradict their ideological stances . The House members Boehner 's trying to walk back from the ledge do n't read the Times or the Post . They do n't care what Brookings or the CBO or CRS say . They believe every `` nonpartisan '' or `` objective '' information source to be a part of the vast liberal conspiracy , and they rely for their facts and predictions strictly on sources explicitly aligned with the conservative movement . And those sources are just telling them crazy , untrue things , all the time .\nThat 's Boehner 's problem : He 's trying to ease his members into the real world , where defunding Obamacare is impossible as long as Obama is in the White House , and where attempts to do so via incredibly unconventional means could have disastrous consequences . What makes his job more difficult is that this reality is n't acknowledged by most of the conservative organizations his members , and his party 's voters , exclusively follow .\nTake Heritage , for years the most influential conservative think tank ( it is still in the top five , depending on how you categorize advocacy groups like FreedomWorks ) . Heritage has been attempting to convince Republicans that a shutdown would n't be such a big deal . Polls commissioned by Heritage say a government shutdown would n't cause anyone to lose their seats , so have at it ! The poll , by the way , was conducted entirely in Republican or Republican-leaning House districts .\nNow , the venerable Heritage Foundation is n't saying this . The poll , and the shutdown encouragement , were issued by `` Heritage Action for America , '' the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) group founded as Heritage 's sister organization in 2010 , to take advantage of the new post-Citizens United `` almost anything goes '' rules for supposed `` social welfare '' organizations . `` Think of it as the Heritage Foundation with teeth , '' Betsy Woodruff said in the National Review . So far Heritage Action has been using those teeth to drag the GOP into the world of right-wing fantasy , in which the Farm Bill must be rejected because it does not cut food stamps enough , and the border `` surge '' amendment to the immigration reform bill must be opposed because $ 38 billion worth of fences and agents are n't enough .\nFor years , the Heritage Foundation 's mission was to craft conservative policy ideas that would both be possible to implement and be broadly popular . School vouchers and welfare reform and tax cuts are all ideas within the realm of the politically possible , and they are also all ideas that have polled quite well at various times . This was effective : Reagan and George W. Bush 's domestic agendas came largely prepackaged by Heritage . But now the organization is using its lobbying arm to just demand total fealty , damn the consequences , to the most extreme form of conservatism possible . That is something of a shift . But it 's a shift the movement has seemingly embraced in the Obama era . Now even supposedly `` sober '' and `` grown-up '' conservatives argue that breaching the debt ceiling would n't be so bad -- may even indeed be pretty good depending on how you look at it ! -- and work to convince Republicans that the way to handle demographic change is with strict immigration limits and the militarization of the border , combined with making the party even more dependent solely on white votes .\nThis is not a left-winger pining for the days of Republican `` moderation . '' Heritage and the National Review were always very conservative . They were just realistically conservative . Professional conservatives graduated some time ago from misleading others to lying to themselves .\nIf you want evidence , look at the rapturous praise that greeted the publication of `` American Betrayal '' by Diana West , a book that argues that ... McCarthy was right about everything and that the FDR administration was a puppet regime for Stalin , and that we purposely delayed winning World War II so that the Soviets could have more of Europe when it was finished . The book is just untrue , start to finish . Conservative historian Ronald Radosh -- writing in the online publication of David Horowitz , a man who is not unfriendly to wild conspiracy theories about leftists -- patiently and at length knocked down nearly every single one of its claims in a review . The book is so silly that Radosh planned to ignore it , but he could n't once he saw how the movement had fallen for it :\nBut I changed my mind after seeing the reckless endorsements of its unhinged theories by a number of conservative individuals and organizations . These included the Heritage Foundation which has hosted her for book promotions at a lunchtime speech and a dinner ; Breitbart.com which is serializing America Betrayed ; PJ Media which has already run three favorable features on West ; Amity Shlaes , who writes unnervingly that West \u2019 s book , \u201c masterfully reminds us what history is for : to suggest action for the present \u201d ; and by conservative political scientist and media commentator Monica Crowley , who called West \u2019 s book \u201c A monumental achievement . \u201d\nHey , there 's Heritage again ! And Amity Shlaes , who wrote a book about how FDR made the Depression worse with liberalism .
