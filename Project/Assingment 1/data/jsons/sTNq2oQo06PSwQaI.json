'' asked Rep. Matt Cartwright , a Democrat from Pennsylvania .\nMajor Gen. James Lariviere , deputy director of political-military affairs in Africa with the Defense Department , said the 21-day monitoring period in the U.S. is a standard procedure recommended by the CDC . And the initial 10-day period in West Africa is an extra buffer of time to make sure soldiers are n't exposed to Ebola before they travel to the U.S. and start the three-week monitoring .\nFacing more pushback from Cartwright and others , the Defense officials at the hearing promised to consult with military leaders about extending the 10-day period in Africa to the full 21 days .\n3 . Nurses need better materials , training : Deborah Burger , co-president of National Nurses United , spelled out what she believed was a dire need of equipment and better education to protect nurses while treating Ebola patients . According to a survey done by the group of 3,000 nurses at more than 1,000 hospitals in the U.S. , 85 % of nurses say they have n't been adequately trained .\nGowns and material worn by nurses in Dallas who treated the first Ebola patient in the U.S. still had their necks and wrists exposed , Burger said .

The CDC should have been more careful : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially said that the U.S. was prepared and ready to prevent the spread of Ebola . But after the two nurses came down with the virus , the organization was forced to admit that it made mistakes and began to issue more caution about the virus .\nConnolly said he was frustrated with how the CDC tried to educate the public about the Ebola virus , saying you should `` never reassure the public when you do n't know . ''\n`` Never do that because when you do that , you damage your credibility , '' he said .\nRep. Doug Collins , R-Georgia , argued Americans are tired of hearing officials take extra steps out of `` an abundance of caution '' after an Ebola scare .\n`` The American people need to see the abundance of caution beforehand , '' Rep.
