    "content": "President Trump is expanding the culture wars , launching new attacks against institutions that he views as liberal , elitist or both .\nWith his agenda stalled in Congress and his poll numbers sagging , Trump has kept his base engaged and the left inflamed by escalating feuds with key figures in sports , entertainment , tech and media , effectively dragging politics into every corner of public life .\nTrump \u2019 s aim is straightforward : To convince voters that there is a privileged class that scoffs at their patriotism and cares more about political correctness and diversity than ordinary Americans , their traditions and their economic plight .\nThe president \u2019 s allies say he \u2019 s guided in this fight by the same instincts that got him elected . Trump \u2019 s relentless attacks , they say , cut to the heart of Trump \u2019 s appeal. \u201c The reality is that , to the average American voter , esoteric policy is not very digestible , \u201d said Sam Nunberg , a former Trump aide . \u201c But culture is policy and the president understands that. \u201d Democrats argue that the president is doing lasting damage to the country by needlessly stoking divisions at a time of extreme political polarization . They believe time is on their side as older , white voters give way to a more diverse and socially liberal electorate as millennials come of age. \u201c If he is scoring political points off these culture war issues in the short run , it 's only with a base that is now starting to crack , \u201d said David Brock , a top Democratic operative . \u201c Exploiting these divisions is both wrong and , in the longer run , a losing proposition politically given that the broader electorate is more tolerant and diverse. \u201d Past presidents have similarly stoked cultural divisions .
