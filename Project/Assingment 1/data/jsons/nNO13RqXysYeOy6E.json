Students and even faculty members wo n't let Dave Rubin speak . They constantly interrupt , shouting `` hate speech ! '' and `` black lives matter ! ''\nRubin was once a man of the left . He even was a co-host on The Young Turks network .\nHe did long interviews with people like talk show host Larry Elder . In that interview , Rubin referred to `` systemic racism '' and said that `` cops are more willing shoot if the perpetrator is black . ''\n`` What 's your data for that ? '' replied Elder . Then he gave Rubin answers the left does n't like to hear , like , `` Seventy percent of homicides are black-on-black ... '' and `` The idea that a racist white cop shooting black people is a peril to black people is complete and total b.s . ''\n`` He just beat me with fact over fact about how systemic racism does n't exist -- not that racism does n't exist , '' Rubin told me .\nThe more people Rubin interviewed , the more he became convinced something was missing in the left 's picture of the world .\n`` I realized not everyone that ( the left ) disagreed with could be a racist and a bigot and a homophobe and a sexist . That was the argument constantly being laid out . If a Republican gave a speech and said , 'We should lower taxes , ' their answer was , 'he 's racist ' . Now that actually makes no sense . ''\nRubin now considers himself a classical liberal . That means he believes in liberalism roughly as it was before today 's liberals added big government to the philosophy and subtracted belief in individual freedom . `` If you believe in the individual , then you fundamentally understand that individuals are different , so you are willing to sit down with someone different than you , '' says Rubin .\nHe still disagrees with conservatives about many things -- he 's a married gay man who is pro-pot and pro-criminal justice reform . But he found that conservatives are willing to debate those topics . `` For all the differences that we have -- I 'm pro-choice ; most of them are pro-life . I 'm against the death penalty ; most of them are for the death penalty -- they 're all willing to sit down and discuss ideas . ''\nSome of his podcasts last one or more hours . I never thought people would be interested in such long interviews , but I was wrong . Millions listen and watch his YouTube videos .\n`` I did n't know what was going to happen , but I started doing these long-form interviews , and people kept watching . Suddenly , I realized , 'Whoa , there 're a lot of people thinking the things that I 'm thinking . ' ''\n`` He 's a puppet for the right wing , '' said Ana Kasparian on Rubin 's old Young Turks network . `` He was lazy when he worked here . He 's lazy now with his ridiculous show . ''\n`` I lose friends now , '' says Rubin . `` This goes to the laziness of the argument of the left . They truly believe that if you disagree , you 're evil . ''\nMany on the left have also come to believe that words themselves are a form of violence , so some now said Rubin 's words must not be heard .\nAs he tried to speak at the University of New Hampshire , a women 's studies professor screamed , `` We do n't want you in the LGBT community , so get the f -- - out ! ''\n`` It 's an oppression Olympics , '' Rubin told me . `` The more marginalized you claim to be , the more political clout you have on campus or in left-wing circles ...
