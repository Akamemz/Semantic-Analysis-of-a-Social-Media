Shimon Peres , former president , prime minister and Nobel Prize winner , died at age 93 after suffering a massive stroke two weeks ago .\nWorld leaders are planning to attend Peres 's funeral at Jerusalem 's Mount Herzl cemetery Friday . Among them are President Barack Obama , Secretary of State John Kerry , former President Bill Clinton and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton , U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon , British Prime Minister Theresa May , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel .\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife , Sara , expressed deep personal sorrow over Peres 's passing .\nJewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky said Peres cared deeply about the Jewish nation-state and its people .\n`` Throughout his many roles in Israel 's leadership and over many years , Peres was always driven by a deep sense of responsibility toward the entire Jewish people , '' Sharansky said in a statement . `` He concerned himself with the fate and future of the entire nation , but also with each of its sons and daughters , both near and far . ''\nPresident Obama hailed Peres as a one of the few people who had changed `` the course of human history , not just through their role in human events but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves . ''\nWhen Peres first fell ill , Gordon Robertson , CEO of the Christian Broadcasting Network , hailed him as the type of leader the world needs more of today .\n`` He has given all peace-loving people around the world hope in some of our bleakest hours , working tirelessly to build bridges and forge alliances many thought impossible , '' he said . `` He is truly a man of peace . He is also a man of great strength and resolve who has stood with an iron fist against countless acts of anti-Semitism , drawing from his own story and fighting endless efforts to disenfranchise the Jewish people . ''\n`` Israel and our world need his type of leadership now more than at perhaps any other time in my memory , '' Robertson added .\nOne of Israel 's founding fathers , Peres ' life spanned the entire history of modern Israel .

He 's been on the political scene for 70 years . He has a political life that 's longer than Moses \u2013 more than 40 years in the desert . And he 's been all over the canvas politically , '' Widlanski said .\n`` He was with David Ben Gurion . He was a security hawk and then toward his closing years , he 's been very much a security dove -- somebody who believes in concessions , '' Widlanski continued .\nPeres is best known as the secret architect of the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s , which kick-started the `` peace process \u201d between Israel and the Palestinians . He won a Nobel peace prize , along with Yasser Arafat , for his efforts .\nWidlanski said Peres will be remembered for the good and the bad .\n`` His place in history is two huge successes and two or three huge mistakes , '' he explained . `` His huge success was that together with Ben Gurion he set up Israel 's reactor and its nuclear program .

Though Israel was condemned at the time , the United States and others praised Israel for its foresight when they invaded Iraq a decade later , after the terror attacks in the United States on 9/11 .\n`` And his biggest failure is the Oslo Accords \u2013 the deal with the PLO , which he naively believed would bring peace to Israel , brought more harm , more terror than anything ever before , '' Widlanski added .\nWhat is perhaps less known is that Peres was among those who tried to establish the first Israeli settlement on the ruins of Sebastia in the northern west bank in 1974 .\nIronically , that ideology of settling the land was what he wanted to uproot in the Oslo Accords , nearly two decades later .\n`` His natural impulse and his advisors were to make a huge deal that would bring peace in our time , like Neville Chamberlain . And like Neville Chamberlain , Peres naively believed that .
