Rising Democratic star enters 2020 race \u2013 video\nBut he comes from a different world . Obama was raised by his grandparents in an apartment building in Hawaii . Booker \u2019 s parents were two of the first black executives at IBM and his family was the first to integrate a leafy New Jersey suburb , Harrington Park . Booker often tells a story about how his parents worked with fair housing activists to integrate the town . They had to . Real estate agents , he says , would falsely tell African Americans asking about buying a house that the property was already sold .\nBooker \u2019 s parents managed to buy his childhood home by having a white couple put down a bid , only for his father and a lawyer to show up instead at the closing . The real estate agent punched the lawyer and set a dog on Booker \u2019 s father . But the house was sold .\nMy parents told me : \u2018 Boy , you have to remember the struggles that got you here ' Cory Booker\nIn a recent speech in Selma , Alabama , Booker said his \u201c parents told me when I was sitting around the kitchen table , \u2018 Boy , you have to remember the struggles that got you here \u2019 \u201d .\nGrowing up in the prosperous majority-white community , he has said , his family seemed like \u201c four raisins in a tub of sweet vanilla ice cream \u201d . Booker excelled as a high school athlete and was named Gatorade New Jersey Football Player of the Year . He earned a scholarship to Stanford , turning down an effort by former president Gerald Ford to recruit him for the University of Michigan .\nBooker \u2019 s college football career was not a success . A backup tight end , he didn \u2019 t catch a pass until his junior year and mostly played special teams . But he was more than a jock . He worked in a crisis counseling center , was elected class president and wrote columns for college papers .\nThose columns have provided fodder for opponents . For a student , he was perhaps unusually introspective . He wrote about groping a fellow teen when they were 15 , and about how his experience working with rape survivors changed his views on sex and gender .\nAnother column was about overcoming homophobia . \u201c I hated gays , \u201d he wrote . \u201c The disgust and latent hostility I felt toward gays were subcategories of hatred , plain and simple . \u201d\nBut he also wrote that \u201c it didn \u2019 t take me long to realize that the root of my hatred did not lie with gays but with myself . It was my problem . A problem I dealt with by ceasing to tolerate gays and instead seeking to embrace them . In these efforts I have found another community with which I feel akin and from which I draw strength . The gay people with whom I am close are some of the strongest , most passionate and caring people I know and their demands for justice are no less imperative than those of any other community . \u201d\nBooker went to Oxford , as a Rhodes scholar . There , he developed a lifelong interest in Judaism and became the first non-Jew to lead the L \u2019 Chaim Society . He went on to attend Yale Law School , where he co-founded another Jewish group . Booker now keeps a Jewish Bible on his desk , along with a Christian Bible , the Qur \u2019 an and the Bhagavad Gita .\nHis time at Yale also saw him get involved in Newark , New Jersey , the city he would lead and where he still lives . He moved to the city 30 miles south of his childhood home during his third year at Yale . Inspired by Geoffrey Canada , the founder of the Harlem Children \u2019 s Zone , he wanted to undertake a similar effort . He described the decision in an interview with Yale Law \u2019 s magazine :\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to move to Newark and I \u2019 m going to dive into a community and try to be a part of social change within a community . Once I made that decision , more and more people seemed to appear \u2026 to guide me into making things work .\nLiving in Brick Towers , a public housing project , he found himself running for the city council against a longtime incumbent tied to the Newark political machine . As Booker described it , \u201c it was a very big switch and it was a switch I had to make spiritually because , frankly , I didn \u2019 t view politicians in all that great a light \u201d .\nHe won and the New York Times attributed his victory to his \u201c nontraditional technique of knocking on nearly every door in the district \u201d .\n\u201c I was having a really bad time , \u201d he said in a 2008 interview . \u201c I was even having a bad time justifying being a city council person because I wasn \u2019 t feeling like I was making the kind of change that I was elected to make and even people who believed in me thought that by electing me a city council person I could get things done . I felt like they were losing faith or getting frustrated as well . \u201d\nSo Booker went on a hunger strike . The longtime vegetarian fasted for 10 days , aiming to draw attention to crime . While doing so , he lived in a tent . He went on to live in a motorhome for a summer , going from one crime-ridden corner of the city to another in an effort to draw attention . The stunts did more than that . They were a way for Booker , a lone reformer , to get things done . As he told New York Magazine in 2018 , \u201c when there \u2019 s no systems and no efficiency , it \u2019 s the squeaky wheel that gets the oil , and so if I took pictures of potholes and pushed them out to the community , it would get action really , really quick . \u201d\nBooker seems to have made some alliances that may have been necessary to dislodge a thoroughly corrupt political machine Jeff Hauser\nBooker also distinguished himself as an advocate for charter schools . In a 2000 speech at the center-right Manhattan Institute , he said : \u201c Public education is the use of public dollars to educate our children at the schools that are best equipped to do so \u2013 public schools , magnet schools , charter schools , Baptist schools , Jewish schools. \u201d In a 2014 interview he said this meant he \u201c became a pariah in Democratic circles for taking on the party orthodoxy on education \u201d . However , he noted , it also meant he gained \u201c all these Republican donors and donors from outside Newark , many of them motivated because we have an African American urban Democrat telling the truth about education \u201d .\nEver since , the political left has harbored concerns about Booker . Jeff Hauser , chief executive of the Revolving Door Project and a longtime Democratic operative , said : \u201c Booker seems to have made some alliances early on that made sense and may have been necessary to try to dislodge a thoroughly corrupt political machine in Newark. \u201d But , Hauser said , this involved \u201c a universe of hedge fund executives who were deeply committed to the theory that America \u2019 s inequities were caused by public school teachers \u201d .\nWhile that \u201c association has decreased noticeably over time \u201d , Hauser said , \u201c it definitely created a significant level of distrust between Booker and significant elements of the labor movement that he has worked pretty hard to overcome since he became a senator \u201d .\nIn 2002 , Booker ran for mayor against longtime incumbent Sharpe James . He raised more than $ 3m , much of it from outside the city , for a brutal campaign that was documented by an Oscar-nominated documentary , Streetfight . James accused Booker of being white , Jewish and gay , smearing him as being insufficiently black to lead a city like Newark .\n\u201c You have to learn to be black , and we don \u2019 t have time to teach you , \u201d James taunted .\nThe Newark mayor used his power freely . City inspectors would show up at businesses sporting Booker signs and say they were violating city codes . Police officers took the signs down . The race didn \u2019 t turn Booker into a winner \u2013 he lost by 53 % -47 % \u2013 but it did turn him into a national figure and a symbol of a new generation of African American leadership .\nFour years later , Booker ran again . James decided not to run and Booker won easily . Two years later , James went to prison on charges connected to the city selling land to his mistress . He was the third former mayor of Newark since the 1960s to be convicted in federal court .\nBooker \u2019 s time in charge of Newark met with mixed reviews . He took over a city with deep structural problems , on the eve of the 2008 recession . An attempt to reshape Newark \u2019 s schools with the aid of $ 100m from Mark Zuckerberg did not live up to expectations . But Celia King , who leads Leadership Newark , a not-for-profit focused on public policy , saw Booker \u2019 s tenure as a plus .\n\u201c I think people who were external to the community and did not have confidence in the community started flocking to this change and to this new person , \u201d she said , \u201c and people began to have a tremendous amount of faith in his ability and the change he was going to do . \u201d\nShe also noted the \u201c high expectations and tremendous amount of pressure \u201d Booker faced but thought he brought the city \u2019 s profile up and that his mayorship has had a lasting effect .\nThe arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice , we must bend it Cory Booker\nIn 2013 , the New Jersey senator Frank Lautenberg died at the age of 89 . In a four-way primary against two members of Congress and the speaker of the state assembly , Booker won easily . He then coasted to victory in a general election against Steve Lonegan , a legally blind Tea Party activist with a history of controversial comments .\nThe election brought new scrutiny . In particular , questions were raised about a longstanding anecdote Booker used in speeches , about a drug dealer named \u201c T-Bone \u201d who he said lived near him in inner-city Newark . National Review reported that \u201c T-Bone \u201d was in fact a composite of several people . Booker had conceded that \u201c although T-Bone \u2019 s corporeal being is 1,000 % real , he \u2019 s an \u2018 archetype \u2019 of an aspect of Newark \u2019 s woe whose actual nom de crack may not actually be T-Bone \u201d . There were several criminals in Newark who used the name T-Bone at the time .\nAs , at first , the only African American Democrat in the Senate , Booker built a national profile quickly , even being considered as a running mate for Hillary Clinton in 2016 . But it was the election of Donald Trump that really boosted his visibility , as a member of the judiciary committee .\nHe made headlines by becoming the first sitting senator to testify against a colleague in a confirmation hearing , when Jeff Sessions was nominated to be attorney general . Booker said :\nThe arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice , we must bend it . America needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc . Senator Sessions \u2019 record does not speak to that desire , intention or will .\nHe also received national attention for his performance during the confirmation hearings for supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh , when Booker announced he would publish confidential documents that raised questions about Kavanaugh \u2019 s views on racial justice . The documents turned out to have been cleared for release the night before . Other Democrats backed Booker and he jokingly compared himself to Spartacus . The moniker has stuck on the right , as a pejorative .\nNow , as a presidential candidate , Booker has built a strong campaign apparatus and has been endorsed by almost every major Democratic politician in his home state . He has signed on to key progressive priorities such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal and he cuts a unique figure by still living in a lower-income neighborhood in Newark , across the street from an outpatient recovery house . Robert Budsock , chief executive of Integrity House , says that gives Booker a unique perspective , \u201c living in a neighborhood where he is able to live side by side with people who are struggling \u201d .\nThe question is whether the Democratic electorate is ready for Booker \u2019 s brand of politics in the age of Trump .

Andy Surabian , a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official , said : \u201c Cory Booker is incredibly overrated as a politician and would have a much better chance if , instead of trying to appeal to the hard left , he embraces who he really is , which was a moderate pro-business Democrat . \u201d\nYet ideology may not matter as much as rhetoric .
