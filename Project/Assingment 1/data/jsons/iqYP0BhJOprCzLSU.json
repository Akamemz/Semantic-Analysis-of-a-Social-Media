    "content": "Well , he already left the House Freedom Caucus . He \u2019 s for the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump . It \u2019 s not shocking that Rep. Justin Amash ( I-MI ) decided to declare his intention to leave the Republican Party . It \u2019 s the usual crap from these clowns . He \u2019 s doing it because of principles . That \u2019 s fine , but even his stance on why eh supported Trump \u2019 s impeachment was a bit shaky since it means buying into the alleged ( and probable ) abuse of power that was exercised by the government against the Trump campaign during the 2016 election . If the Department of Justice Inspector General report is as scorching as we \u2019 ve heard from the grapevine , then everyone on this impeachment train is going to look like idiots .

He announced his exit from the Republican Party in an op-ed for The Washington Post ( via WaPo ) :\nMy parents , both immigrants , were Republicans . I supported Republican candidates throughout my early adult life and then successfully ran for office as a Republican . The Republican Party , I believed , stood for limited government , economic freedom and individual liberty \u2014 principles that had made the American Dream possible for my family . In recent years , though , I \u2019 ve become disenchanted with party politics and frightened by what I see from it . The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions . [ \u2026 ] In this hyperpartisan environment , congressional leaders use every tool to compel party members to stick with the team , dangling chairmanships , committee assignments , bill sponsorships , endorsements and campaign resources . As donors recognize the growing power of party leaders , they supply these officials with ever-increasing funds , which , in turn , further tightens their grip on power . [ \u2026 ] Modern politics is trapped in a partisan death spiral , but there is an escape . Most Americans are not rigidly partisan and do not feel well represented by either of the two major parties .
