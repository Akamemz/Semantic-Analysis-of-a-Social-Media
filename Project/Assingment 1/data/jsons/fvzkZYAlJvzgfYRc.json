There have been eight shootings at US schools this year that resulted in injury or death , including 17 dead on Wednesday . In December , the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting , in which 20 children and six teachers died , was marked by congressional Republicans seeking to weaken restrictions and make it easier to carry a concealed weapon across state lines .

These are the three worst incidents : 14 February 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School , Florida 14 December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary , Connecticut 20 April 1999 Columbine High School , Colorado Why is the NRA so powerful ? In 2017 , the NRA spent at least $ 4.1m on lobbying . In the 2016 US elections , it spent $ 14.4m supporting 44 candidates who won , and $ 34.4m opposing 19 who lost , according to CRP .
