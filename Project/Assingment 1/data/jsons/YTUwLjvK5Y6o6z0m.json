    "content": "Three days after the Republican health-care bill collapsed , Rep. Charlie Dent ( R ) of Pennsylvania called a press conference to tell reporters he was going to try a different way to fix the Affordable Care Act .\nStanding just off the House floor , Congressman Dent said the only way to sustainable , durable health-care reform is to work with Democrats \u2013 one fix at a time . That was the conclusion he 'd come to along with a few other Republicans .\nThat stance resonated with some voters back in Dent \u2019 s politically mixed Pennsylvania district . \u201c It was uplifting , \u201d says Sandra Birchmeier , a Democrat and Dent fan , who saw the press conference on the local news that night .\nDent \u2019 s strategy may sound na\u00efve in an era of hyper-polarization , in which the hard-line Freedom Caucus looks to have the upper hand among House Republicans . But Dent and other relatively moderate Republicans just proved they are a force to be reckoned with .\nHard-liners took the fall for the health-care debacle , but at least 25 non-Freedom Caucus members either leaned against , or , like Dent , said flat-out that they would oppose the bill if it came to the floor . For lack of votes , it never did .\nIn bucking their own leadership \u2013 and President Trump \u2013 moderate Republicans have suddenly become far more visible , after years of being overshadowed by their staunch right-wing colleagues . Now , on everything from tax reform to spending and infrastructure , they will likely try to pull their conservative leadership toward more centrist positions that will fly in their swing districts .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a tug of war within the party \u201d and moderates are the \u201c majority-makers , \u201d says Michael Steel , who was the spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio . \u201c They will provide the margin of victory or loss on every big issue . \u201d\nLike-minded Republicans have another thing going for them , says Dent , in an interview at his Allentown , Pa. , district office on Friday . Reality .\nShedding his bomber jacket on a cold rainy day , the congressmen relaxes into a leather chair and points out that it has taken votes from both parties to pass spending bills , avert fiscal cliffs , increase the debt ceiling , and approve major legislation and reforms . The big exception was Obamacare , of course .\n\u201c Now the question is : Why don \u2019 t we simply accept what appears to be reality , that in order to pass any of these big bills , that we have to do it on a bipartisan basis ? \u201d\nHours earlier , cars packed the parking lot at a Bethlehem , Pa. , community center , when about 400 people came to hear Dent hold his first in-person town hall of the new Congress .\nStanding on a bunting-festooned stage , he reached into a basket of constituent questions , and read from an index card : \u201c Will you , as an elected official representative of the people , stand up against the morass of lies and misinformation put forth by this administration , or will you hide ? \u201d\nCheers erupted from an overwhelmingly Democratic crowd ( and sometimes , jeers ) . When the noise died down , Dent \u2013 now starting his seventh term \u2013 answered in substance : My job is to represent the people of my district .
