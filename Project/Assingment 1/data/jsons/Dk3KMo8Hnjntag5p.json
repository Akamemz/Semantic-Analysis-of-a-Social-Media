'' In a statement shortly afterward , a Biden spokesperson denied that the vice president or his staff had been aware that Flores was uncomfortable .\n`` In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life , I have offered countless handshakes , hugs , expressions of affection , support and comfort , '' Biden said in his own statement Sunday . `` And not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately . If it is suggested I did so , I will listen respectfully . But it was never my intention . ''\nBiden added : `` I may not recall these moments the same way , and I may be surprised at what I hear . But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences , and men should pay attention . And I will .\n`` I will also remain the strongest advocate I can be for the rights of women , '' he continued . `` I will fight to build on the work I \u2019 ve done in my career to end violence against women and ensure women are treated with the equality they deserve .

If he is saying he never believed that was inappropriate , then frankly I believe that 's a little bit of a disconnection . And ... a sense of not being aware .
