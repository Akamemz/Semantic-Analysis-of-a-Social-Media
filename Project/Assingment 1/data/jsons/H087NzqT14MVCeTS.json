    "content": "President Trump \u2019 s idea to deploy active-duty military forces to quell increasingly violent riots in cities across the country has sparked a sharp legal and constitutional clash .\nBut an even more explosive debate has broken out on a question once believed unthinkable : Should \u2014 and will \u2014 rank-and-file troops obey the commander in chief if they are ordered to round up American citizens on the streets of New York , Louisville or Chicago ?\nSome prominent veterans and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling on service members to \u201c lay down your arms \u201d and defy Mr. Trump \u2019 s orders should he invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and seek to move tanks and personnel to major metropolitan areas as civil unrest grows after the Memorial Day death of George Floyd during a confrontation with Minneapolis police .\nThat in turn has sparked an angry rebuttal from top retired military officials , who say U.S. soldiers and seamen would of course follow orders and that even to raise the question is irresponsible .\n\u201c Though there are always outliers , I would expect almost all U.S. troops to obey any lawful order to quell rioting in cities , even where the instigators or participants are American citizens , and even if they disagreed with the order , \u201d retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles J. Dunlap Jr. told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBut in this , as in so many other ways , Mr. Trump represents a distinct break with his predecessors . The racial tensions inflamed by the Floyd killing are matched by unresolved racial tensions within the U.S. military as well .\nQuestions about the troops \u2019 affinity for Mr. Trump are well-founded . The president \u2019 s approval rating among active-duty forces hit the lowest point of his tenure in December , according to a Military Times poll , and troops have been tasked with patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border , aiding the national medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other missions outside the Pentagon \u2019 s more traditional scope .\nCritics say that asking troops to act as domestic riot police would be a bridge too far and should spur young men and women to openly revolt .\n\u201c The president has made it clear that the fight for these constitutional principles is a fight against himself , \u201d said Rep. Seth Moulton , the Massachusetts Democrat and Marine Corps veteran who made a brief run for the Democratic president nomination . \u201c We must therefore , with every ounce of conviction , every commitment to peace and every glimmer of hope , join in lawful protest to overcome his tyranny .\n\u201c And if he chooses to abuse the military as a tyrant would do \u2014 to stifle dissent , suppress freedom and cement inequality \u2014 then I call on all our proud young men and women in uniform , as a veteran and a patriot , to lay down your arms , uphold your oath and join this new march for freedom , \u201d Mr. Moulton added .\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith , Washington Democrat , said he had \u201c serious concerns about using military forces to respond to protesters \u201d and that he plans to call Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley to explain Mr. Trump \u2019 s policy .\nMilitary leaders , of course , insist that men and women of the armed forces will obey the chain of command and follow any lawful orders given by their superiors , including Mr. Trump . Urging troops to lay down their arms en masse , officials and retired military officers say , is ludicrous and dangerous .\nGen. Dunlap , now executive director of the Center on Law , Ethics and National Security at Duke University , said he always opposed using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement , \u201c absent truly extraordinary circumstances . \u201d\n\u201c But it would be dangerous for any politician to suggest that any member of the military to \u2018 lay down their arms \u2019 in defiance of a lawful order , \u201d he said . \u201c We don \u2019 t want those in the armed forces to think they have the right to pick and choose which lawful orders they \u2019 ll obey . \u201d\nAt the same time , the Pentagon has been clear that operating as a domestic law enforcement force is far from the ideal scenario for American forces , including National Guard personnel .\nA military official told reporters at the Pentagon it is \u201c the mission we like doing the least. \u201d The Pentagon \u2019 s clear preference is to let the National Guard lead the response .\nDozens of states have activated National Guard forces to assist police in the effort to deal with growing unrest .
