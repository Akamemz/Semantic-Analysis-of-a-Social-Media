    "content_original": "WHY THIS QUESTION MATTERS:\n\nIn April, the White House announced that the U.S. would halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending a review of the organization\u2019s purported missteps responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States is usually the largest funder of the WHO, followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nThis decision has sparked heated debate. We\u2019ll get to that in a second.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, here\u2019s some things to know before we begin:\n\nWHO is part of the United Nations and is comprised of and run by 194 member nations\n\nMember states choose a delegation to represent the country in the World Health Assembly.\n\nThe Executive Board operationalizes policies set by the World Health Assembly.\n\nIn its seventy-year life, the WHO has logged both successes, such as eradicating smallpox, and perceived failures, such as its delayed response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 (read more here and here).\n\n\n\n\n\nA QUICK REVIEW OF THE WHO:\n\nThe UN was founded in 1948, several years after the United Nations was formed. Although it\u2019s headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the organization functions through a collection of six semi-autonomous regional offices. The Director-General of the WHO is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is currently serving a five-year elected term.\n\nThe WHO is funded by assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. The assessed contributions are required of each member state, scaled by income and population. Meanwhile, voluntary contributions may be made by member states (in addition to assessed contributions) or may be made by individual donors. As noted, the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation is the second largest funder of the WHO via voluntary contributions. Overall, voluntary contributions make up 80% of the total.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s objective is to monitor and coordinate activities related to health issues including, genetically modified foods, climate change, tobacco and drug use, and road safety.\n\nWHO RESPONSE TO COVID-19:\n\nMany have been critical of the WHO\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is particular concern over the influential role that China has played in curating the information released in the early stages of the crisis. A new article in the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine, notes \u201cinfluence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO.\u201d\n\nHowever, the White House move to halt funding entirely during the pandemic has also been met with considerable criticism. In the analysis below we\u2019ll walk through the key points made by proponents of halting funds and opponents to halting funds.\n\nTHE COMMON THREAD:\n\nBoth sides say that the world needs effective and coordinated leadership to respond to global health crises.\n\nFIND YOUR THREAD:\n\nProponents claim halting WHO funding is necessary to address the missteps and clear political bias demonstrated by the WHO. Opponents of halting WHO funding say that it\u2019s irresponsible to discontinue funding of the world\u2019s most influential health organization in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nWhat do you think?",
