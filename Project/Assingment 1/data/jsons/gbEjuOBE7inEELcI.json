    "content": "One day after a depraved attack on an Orlando , Fla. , nightclub left 49 victims dead and 53 more wounded , investigators are working to learn more about the man they say was the lone shooter : Omar Mateen , who was killed at the scene . The case is being treated as a terrorist investigation .\nAfter being briefed on the case Monday , President Obama said , `` It appears that the shooter was inspired by various extremist information '' online ; he added that `` all those materials '' are now being scrutinized and `` exploited . ''\nThe president discussed the Orlando case in the Oval Office , in which he spoke for nearly 15 minutes Monday after being briefed by FBI Director James Comey \u2014 who said that Mateen had been on a watch list during a federal investigation , but he 'd been taken off of it after the inquiry close down in 2014 .\nObama added that investigators have n't seen signs that Mateen was directed by ISIS , noting that the gunman pledged allegiance to the group at a late juncture . Comparing the attack to one that hit San Bernardino , Calif. , last December , Obama called it `` homegrown extremism . ''\nFamilies and friends of people who were in the Pulse nightclub have spent the past 24 hours trying to learn whether their loved ones survived , gathering in the street near the scene of the shooting . As of Monday morning , investigators said that 48 of the 49 victims had been identified , and that 24 families had been notified so far .\nAll victims have now been removed from the scene , and the process of reconstructing the events with forensics techniques is now beginning , Paul Wysopal , special agent-in-charge of the FBI 's Tampa division , said at a morning news conference in Orlando .\nPolice say Mateen , who had come under FBI scrutiny at least twice over potential links to terrorism , carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history with guns he had legally purchased in recent days . Mateen also pledged his allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the attack , but officials said they have n't seen a direct link between the gunman and the terrorist group .\nThe attack targeted Pulse Orlando , a gay nightclub that had been throwing a Latin Night dance party . In a report for NPR , Eileen Holliday depicted the club as `` a longtime staple in the gay community '' that drew a wide-ranging audience .\nWe 'll update this post as news emerges ; here 's a look at where things stand :\nThe violence began in the early hours of Sunday , June 12 . Drawing from the police summary given Monday morning :\nJust after 2 a.m . ET , an Orlando police officer who was in uniform and working at Pulse responded to shots fired . The officer exchanged fire with the attacker near the entrance . More officers arrived ; a second gun battle ensued and the gunman retreated into a bathroom , according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina .\n`` Everyone get out of pulse and keep running , '' read a message posted to the club 's Facebook account at 2:09 a.m . But not everyone got out , and the attack became a hostage situation .\nCircumstances then became relatively stable , Mina said , adding that negotiators spoke to the gunman and that no gunfire was heard . Mateen was `` cool and calm when he was making those phone calls to us , '' Mina said . But the police chief added that the police were concerned the attacker might have had an explosive vest or another bomb .\nAt 5 a.m. , police opted to force entry into the club by using an explosive to breach the exterior cinder-block wall of a bathroom full of people near a bathroom where Mateen had holed up . The decision was made out of concern that a `` further loss of life was imminent , '' Mina said .\nAt the time , Mateen was in a bathroom with 4-5 hostages , Mina said . It was during that time , the FBI 's Comey says , that the gunman had three contacts with a 911 dispatcher . Mina says that another 12-15 people are believed to have been in an adjacent bathroom . But when the authorities acted , the explosive breach did n't penetrate the wall completely , and an armored vehicle was used to put a hole in the wall . That 's when hostages began to emerge .\n`` The suspect came out of that hole himself , '' Mina said , and began firing at police . He was then killed .\nOrlando police say 11 officers were involved in that part of the operation , which they say rescued some 30 hostages .\nPolice identified the gunman as Omar Mir Seddique Mateen , 29 , of Fort Pierce , Fla. A U.S. citizen , Mateen used an AR-15-style rifle and a handgun to carry out the attack , officials said .\nAn agent with the field office of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives said Mateen legally purchased the firearms , acquiring them in the past week .\nAfter sitting in on a briefing with FBI Director Comey , NPR 's Carrie Johnson reports , `` Mateen was on a watch list when the first investigation of him by the FBI began in May 2013 , and taken off of the list when the investigation was closed March 2014 . ''\nShe adds that adds that the FBI would have gotten a notification if Mateen had tried to buy deadly weapons while on the watch list .\nThe FBI 's Wysopal said Monday that some 100 leads have been generated .\nThe ongoing criminal investigation is in the early stages , said U.S. Attorney Lee Bentley .
