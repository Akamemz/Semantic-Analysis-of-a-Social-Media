But it would be an absolute triumph for some of the conservative press .\nAs much as any candidate , it is the press corps that is on the ballot on Tuesday . Expos\u00e9s by The Washington Post turned what was supposed to be a sleepy contest in one of the most conservative states in the country into a political battleground . Since then , the primary question being asked of voters , and pushed by conservative media sympathetic to Moore , has been : Do you\u2014can you\u2014believe the sexual-misconduct allegations that you have read ?\nMoore has done his best to sow doubts . He has leaned on the large , enthusiastic voter base he built throughout his decades in public life\u2014a base that showed up in full force at a rally at Jordan \u2019 s Activity Barn here in Dale County on Monday night . And to keep it intact , he has resorted to a nonstop barrage of attacks on a press corps that he \u2019 s deemed disingenuous and agenda-driven .\n\u201c Nobody \u2019 s going to believe The Washington Post .

Moore \u2019 s wife , Kayla , used the entirety of her speech to harangue the \u201c fake news. \u201d Janet Porter , a TV spokeswoman for the Moore campaign , slammed the \u201c lynch-mob media. \u201d Another speaker told the crowd that members of the press \u201c hate you and hold in contempt everything you hold dear , including your life and your precious Christian faith . \u201d\nAs Moore \u2019 s supporters flooded into the recreational hall here in rural southeastern Alabama , they regularly rebuffed reporters who tried to conduct interviews . During the rally\u2014which lasted two and a half hours and featured nearly a dozen speakers\u2014the media was heckled more than any mention of other popular Trump punching bags .\n\u201c [ Reporters ] keep talking about this like there \u2019 s some truth to it .
