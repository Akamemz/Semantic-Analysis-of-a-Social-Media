    "content": "Christine Blasey Ford said she is `` one hundred percent '' certain that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is the person who sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers , and she told a Senate committee that he and his friend laughed at her expense during the attack .\n`` With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you ? '' Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois asked Ford during a Senate hearing that could determine whether the nominee is confirmed to the high court .\nFord also told a nationally televised Judiciary Committee hearing her accusation was `` absolutely not '' a case of mistaken identity . She said the 1982 incident was `` seared into my memory , '' even though she doesn \u2019 t remember all the details . Kavanaugh , who will testify later , has strongly denied this and other allegations of sexual misconduct .\nThe hearing was the first time the American public saw the person whose accusations had dominated the headlines for weeks , having only seen her before mostly in a single grainy photo in which she was wearing sunglasses . Her nerves were evident , and her voice cracked during her testimony .\nPresident Donald Trump was watching the hearing from Air Force One , White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said . He hasn \u2019 t talked to Kavanaugh in a couple of days , she said .\nThe California psychology professor said the incident has `` haunted me episodically as an adult . '' She said she was `` terrified '' to testify before the committee and that she she `` agonized daily '' about whether to come forward with her claim .\nFord said Kavanaugh \u2019 s friend , Mark Judge , was in the room during the attack and that the two were laughing at her . She said she had an `` indelible '' memory of `` the uproarious laughter between the two , and their having fun at my expense . ''\nSen. Richard Blumenthal brought Ford to tears when he thanked her for coming forward .\n`` If we agree on nothing else today , I hope on a bipartisan basis we can agree on how much courage it has taken for you to come forward , and I think you have earned America \u2019 s gratitude , '' Blumenthal said .\nDuring a break , GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch told reporters that Ford was a `` an attractive , good witness '' but that it was too early to make a judgment . `` I don \u2019 t think she \u2019 s uncredible . ''\nHatch said he still expects the Judiciary panel to vote on Kavanaugh Friday and expects him to be voted out favorably .\nQuestioning of Ford proceeded in five-minute chunks with a lawyer hired by Republicans , Rachel Mitchell , alternating with Democratic members of the panel and Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley enforcing the time limits .\nMitchell asked Ford about the atmosphere at the home before the alleged attack . `` I can sketch a floor plan , '' Ford said , adding that the event was more of a gathering than a party .\nGrassley of Iowa called for a `` safe , comfortable and dignified '' proceeding as the panel opened a historic hearing that promises to shape the Supreme Court \u2019 s future and redefine the `` Me Too '' era .\nKavanaugh said in his prepared statement that he doesn \u2019 t question that Ford may have been sexually assaulted by someone , but strongly denied that he was the attacker .\n`` I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford , '' Kavanaugh said . `` I have never done that to her or anyone . I am innocent of this charge . ''\nFord said that though they went to different high schools , she had been friendly with a classmate of Kavanaugh \u2019 s and attended a number of parties that the future judge also attended .\n`` We did not know each other well , but I knew him and he knew me , '' Ford said . She said that her husband remembers that she gave Kavanaugh \u2019 s name when the couple discussed the attack in family therapy in 2012 .\nShe said the attack occurred after she went upstairs to use the bathroom . She said she was pushed into a bedroom and onto a bed and that Kavanaugh got on top of her . Judge was in the room and encouraged the attack , she said .\n`` I believed he was going to rape me , '' Ford said . Kavanaugh put his hand on her mouth to keep her from screaming , she said , and because it was hard for her to breathe , `` I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me . '' She said Judge , who has denied any part in such an attack , jumped on them and she was able to escape .\nAsked what she remembers from that night , Ford responded : `` The stairwell , the living room , the bedroom , the bed on the right side of the room as you walk into the room \u2014 there was a bed to the right \u2014 the bathroom in close proximity , the laughter \u2014 the uproarious laughter \u2014 and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so . ''\nUnder questioning from Mitchell , Ford said she didn \u2019 t know how she got home that night . She said the party took place `` somewhere between '' her home and the Columbia Country Club , about seven miles away . The Washington Post previously reported she told the paper the party took place near the country club .\n`` Has anyone come forward to say to you , \u2018 Hey , remember , I was the one that drove you home \u2019 ? '' Mitchell asked .\n`` No , '' Ford responded . She said she didn \u2019 t have her driver \u2019 s license at the time .\nIn his opening statement , Grassley said , `` I want to apologize to you both for the way you \u2019 ve been treated , '' referring to threats made against Ford and Kavanaugh after her allegation became public .\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein thanked Ford for her `` strength and bravery in coming forward . '' The California senator said 60 percent of sexual assaults go unreported , and when women do report them , 'too often , women \u2019 s memories and credibility are put under assault . ' ''\n`` This is not a trial for Dr. Ford , '' Feinstein said . `` It \u2019 s a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh . ''\nFeinstein said the issue is `` a real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court , '' and noted that two other accusers came forward in the last several days .\nKavanaugh is trying to save a Supreme Court nomination that has become besieged by accusations of decades-old sexual misconduct . He has strongly denied all the allegations against him . Grassley lamented that the accusation surfaced after his panel held almost a week of confirmation hearings , while Feinstein accused the GOP of a rush to judgment and complained about a lack of other witnesses .\nFord said Kavanaugh tried to remove her clothes and put his hand over her mouth so she couldn \u2019 t scream . She is one of the three identified women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct but the only one who will testify Thursday .\nRepublicans are trying to get Kavanaugh , 53 , confirmed as early as next week . The Judiciary panel has scheduled a vote for Friday , and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been preparing colleagues for a weekend session that would allow a final vote in a matter of days .\nTrump said Wednesday the allegations are `` all false to me '' but added that he could be persuaded otherwise by Thursday \u2019 s testimony . The committee \u2019 s 10 Democrats are calling on Trump to either withdraw the nomination or order the FBI to do a thorough investigation of the allegations .\nA second woman , Deborah Ramirez of Colorado , claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were freshmen at Yale University . And in the most lurid allegation yet , Julie Swetnick of Washington said in a sworn statement released Wednesday that Kavanaugh took part in efforts during high school to get girls intoxicated so that a group of boys could have sex with them .\nIn a transcript of an interview with Senate investigators released Wednesday night , Kavanaugh said Ramirez \u2019 s allegation `` sounds like an orchestrated hit to take me out . '' He rejected Swetnick \u2019 s claim in a statement Wednesday as `` ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone . ''\nRepublicans hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate and can \u2019 t afford more than one defection to ensure confirmation without Democratic support .\nSeveral GOP lawmakers who remain publicly undecided \u2014 most notably Alaska \u2019 s Lisa Murkowski , Maine \u2019 s Susan Collins and Arizona \u2019 s Jeff Flake \u2014 said they want to hear what Ford has to say before making up their minds . Flake sits on the Judiciary Committee and will have a chance to question Ford and Kavanaugh .\nFord testified first , giving an opening statement before questions by senators and by Mitchell , hired by the panel \u2019 s 11 all-male Republicans to handle their questioning . Then Kavanaugh will do the same .\nCapitol police imposed strict security measures to keep protesters at bay after about 70 people were arrested each day during Kavanaugh \u2019 s earlier hearing . At Ford \u2019 s request , the hearing is being held in a smaller room with less space for media and the public . Protesters are being kept off that floor of the office building . Among those attending was actress Alyssa Milano , an activist in the `` Me Too '' movement .\nSeating Kavanaugh on the nation \u2019 s top court \u2014 or not seating him \u2014 could affect the fight for control of Congress in the Nov. 6 election . Republicans are looking for Kavanaugh to cement a conservative majority on the court , while Democrats say he could provide the fifth vote to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion .\nAccording to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday , 59 percent of Americans think that if Ford \u2019 s accusation is true , Kavanaugh shouldn \u2019 t be confirmed . The poll found that 32 percent of the people who responded believe Ford , 26 percent believe Kavanaugh and 42 percent are unsure whom to believe .",
