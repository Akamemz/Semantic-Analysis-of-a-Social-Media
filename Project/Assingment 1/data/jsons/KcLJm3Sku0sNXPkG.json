Her son has autism and behavioral issues , and over three years \u2014 from 2013 to 2016 \u2014 Tidd got 437 of those letters .\n`` I see this pile of documents that 's 5 inches tall that represents hundreds of hours of being locked into a room , and I feel , you know , horrible , '' Tidd says .\nShe 's sitting in her living room in Northern Virginia , her head hanging over the stack of papers . Tears are in her eyes .\n`` What kind of parent lets this happen to their child ? ... I just trusted the school . I thought that it would work \u2014 we were at our wits ' end with the behaviors and stuff . But it actually just made it worse . ''\nRestraint and seclusion are most often used on students with disabilities or special needs \u2014 children like Tidd 's son . Those terms can mean anything from holding or using restraints on students to isolating them in a separate room or space .\nThe U.S. Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights requires that school districts report every time a student is restrained or secluded . And while tens of thousands of cases are reported , many suspect those numbers fall short .\nThat 's what happened in Tidd 's district , Fairfax County Public Schools , which serves more than 187,000 students . For years , the district told the government that it never secluded or restrained pupils . But an investigation by WAMU found hundreds of cases recorded in internal documents and letters that schools sent to parents .\nFairfax is n't the only district reporting suspiciously low numbers . According to an Education Week analysis of data from the 2013-14 school year , nearly 80 % of districts reported that they never secluded or restrained special education students . That number includes New York City , the nation 's largest school district .\nThe Government Accountability Office , a federal watchdog , is conducting an investigation into the quality of the data that school districts are reporting . Jackie Nowicki , a director at the GAO , says media accounts and testimony from lawmakers have raised `` concerns that seclusion and restraint [ have ] continued to be chronically underreported . ''\nThe investigation in Fairfax highlights a debate taking place in communities across the United States . In Washington state , parents in one school district have filed lawsuits claiming that the district failed to notify them when their children were restrained or secluded . According to some of those lawsuits , that failure has had consequences for families .\nRestraint and seclusion are controversial practices in public schools . According to federal guidance , they 're supposed to be used as a last resort , when students become a danger to themselves or others .\nIt is clear that as a system we have fallen short in this area .\n`` Guidelines are in place for a reason , '' says the GAO 's Nowicki . `` When seclusion and restraint is inappropriately used , it can create some really dangerous situations , especially for some of our nation 's most vulnerable children . ''\nU.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told a group of reporters recently that the department is reviewing some districts that reported questionable numbers .\n`` Our hope is that by proactively going and auditing a few places where things do n't seem to add up and then helping inform and educate , that we can have a much more cohesive approach to ensuring that every child is safe at school and respected for the individual they are , '' DeVos said .\nIn response to the WAMU investigation , Fairfax County is now reporting almost 1,700 cases of seclusion and restraint for the 2017-18 school year . And Fairfax officials say they plan to submit corrected data for the 2015-16 school year .\n`` It is clear that as a system we have fallen short in this area , '' said Fairfax County Superintendent Scott Brabrand at a school board meeting in April . He pledged to work to `` heal the hurt and systematically address these concerns around restraint and seclusion . ''\nTidd still thinks about all the time her son spent in the district 's seclusion rooms .\nMany are built like Russian nesting dolls \u2014 rooms within rooms . The innermost room is reserved for students with more egregious behavior issues . That room is concrete and about the size of a closet . Inside , there are no chairs to sit on and the only window is on the door .\nTidd says the repeated seclusions traumatized her son , causing him to hate school and making him more violent and distrusting of authority figures .\n`` He would poop and pee himself to get out of the seclusion room \u2014 he was so desperate to get out , '' she says . `` This is a child who was completely potty trained since he was 5 . ... That to me , for a nonverbal person , that 's absolute desperation . ''\nTidd 's son is 13 now , and Fairfax County pays for him to attend a private school for students with disabilities . Tidd says he has n't been secluded once since October 2018 , when he started at his current school , and his behavior has dramatically improved .\nTidd knows she is lucky . Not all parents would be able to hire a lawyer and have their child transferred to a private school .\nIn some states , seclusion and restraint reporting requirements go beyond federal regulations . Washington state requires school districts to report annual data to their state education agency \u2014 that 's twice as often as the Office for Civil Rights calls for .\nBut families in one Washington community say there 's an important group their school district is n't routinely reporting to : parents .\nAn investigation by Oregon Public Broadcasting found several parents in Vancouver Public Schools \u2014 a 24,000-student district just north of Portland \u2014 who say school officials rarely notified them when their children had been restrained .\nSarah McPartland says she sent her son , Landon , to Vancouver Public Schools for years before repeated restraints and a lack of follow-through from education officials led her to withdraw him and file a lawsuit .\nThe district settled McPartland 's lawsuit but did not admit any wrongdoing . District officials declined to comment on the case .\nLandon , 10 , is now home-schooled . On a chilly winter day , he moves quickly from brewing tea to painting figurines to examining salamander eggs under his microscope .\n`` I have something called Asperger 's syndrome , which is a specialty type of autism where ... well , I can get really involved and , to an extent , obsessed with things I like , '' he explains over tea .\nThey shoved me to the ground . They grabbed my wrist , and they dragged me up the hill by my wrist . And then they hugged me , like in a wrestling grip , only they would n't let go .\nLandon also has things he really does not like . His mother and his former education assistant say getting Landon to do math requires creative lesson planning \u2014 when he is pressed to do an activity he does n't like , he can lose control .\nLandon recalls getting so upset once in class that he ran away from school , and school staff chased him .\n`` They shoved me to the ground . They grabbed my wrist , and they dragged me up the hill by my wrist . And then they hugged me , like in a wrestling grip , only they would n't let go , '' Landon says .\nLike many states , Washington requires that schools inform parents whenever a child is restrained .

And the response from your child is , 'What does it matter ? You were n't there to help me , ' `` McPartland says with tears in her eyes .\nCara Bailey 's 12-year-old son , Colin , has autism and is mostly nonverbal . Bailey says Colin would be restrained and secluded in his Vancouver school , sometimes several times a day , without her knowledge .\n`` The only way that we realized that he was getting restrained was he came home with handprints on him . ''\nLike McPartland , Bailey opted to home-school her son rather than send him back to Vancouver Public Schools .\n`` You expect that they 're there to educate him and keep him safe . ...
