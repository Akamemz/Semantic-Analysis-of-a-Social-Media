    "content": "Health and New York City officials were trying Friday morning to follow the trail of a young emergency room doctor who traveled about the city for three days before being hospitalized for the Ebola virus .\nThe doctor , Craig Spencer , a member of Doctors Without Borders who had been working in Guinea , returned six days ago and reported Thursday morning coming down with a 100.3-degree fever and diarrhea . He was being treated in an isolation ward at Manhattan 's Bellevue Hospital , a designated Ebola center .\nIn the days before Spencer fell ill , he went on a 3-mile jog , went to the High Line park , rode the subway and , on Wednesday night , got a taxi to a Brooklyn bowling alley . Bassett said he felt fatigued Wednesday but not feverish until Thursday morning .\nThe bowling alley was shuttered Thursday night , and issued a statement saying , `` We 've been in constant contact with the Health Department and they have determined that there was no risk to our customers . ''\nSpencer rode the subway in the past five days , traveling on the A , L and 1 lines , a law-enforcement source told The New York Post .\nMayor Bill de Blasio and Gov . Andrew Cuomo on Thursday urged residents not to be alarmed by the doctor 's Ebola diagnosis , even as they described him riding the subway , taking a cab and bowling . De Blasio said all city officials followed `` clear and strong '' protocols in their handling and treatment of him .\n`` We want to state at the outset that New Yorkers have no reason to be alarmed , '' de Blasio said . `` New Yorkers who have not been exposed are not at all at risk . ''\nHealth officials say the chances of the average New Yorker contracting Ebola , which is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person , are slim .

President Barack Obama spoke to Cuomo and de Blasio Thursday night and offered the federal government 's support . He asked them to stay in close touch with Ron Klain , his `` Ebola czar , '' and public health officials in Washington .\nThe city 's disease detectives have been tracing Spencer 's contacts to identify anyone who may be at risk . The city 's health commissioner , Mary Bassett , said Spencer 's fiancee and two friends had been quarantined but showed no symptoms .\nBassett said the probability was `` close to nil '' that Spencer 's subway ride would pose a risk . Still , the bowling alley was closed as a precaution , and Spencer 's Harlem apartment was cordoned off .
