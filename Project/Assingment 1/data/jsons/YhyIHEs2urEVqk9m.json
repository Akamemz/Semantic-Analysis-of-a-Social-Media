Chris Christie genuinely did not know what his top advisers and confidants were up to , or whether he 's both implicated and a once-in-a-generation-size political liar .\nBut the continuing disclosures , which have filled out the Bridgegate plot and its still-growing cast of characters , tell a story influenced in equal measure by the Sopranos and Keystone Cops .\nThe warring antagonists in this story are , of course , Christie himself and his one-time representative at the Port Authority David Wildstein , who resigned in anticipation of disgrace ahead of the `` time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee '' disclosure .\nIn a proper corruption drama , someone like Wildstein would be awash in hush money or lying in a ditch somewhere , depending on his importance , and relationship to key principals . But since the principal here is a governor with presidential ambitions , and not a private-sector goon of some kind , Wildstein is free to do whatever he wants to escape legal retribution , knowing that physical retribution is out of the question . And he 's made quite a spectacle of himself , trying to bribe an immunity deal out of federal prosecutors .\nThat exact dynamic reveals how short-sighted Christie 's management of the scandal has been .\nHe apparently decided on day one that his only wise strategic play would be to express outrage and disinherit the people with known ( or at least publicly revealed ) involvement in the lane closure scandal . It seemingly never occurred to him that he could effectively distance himself from the culprits without smearing and embittering them at the same time . Do n't say mean things . Have allies twice or thrice removed buy silence with the promise of sinecures or whatever .\nThree or four steps later Christie 's combativeness lead to this anti-Wildstein leak from Christie HQ :\nIn David Wildstein 's past , people and newspaper accounts have described him as `` tumultuous '' and someone who `` made moves that were not productive .
