There is a 24-hour review period of the report , which will likely pass the panel on a party-line vote before heading to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration .\nThe report may give Democrats another chance to repackage their case against President Trump to the American people . Polling showed the American people practically unmoved by the televised impeachment hearings and some independents turned-off from the idea of impeaching the president .\nOn Friday , House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler gave President Trump a deadline of next Friday to inform the committee on whether or not the president intends to participate in his own defense by presenting evidence and calling witnesses . The House Judiciary Committee also plans to conduct hearings related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia report and its findings .\nIn Nadler 's letter to President Trump on Friday , the chair of the House Judiciary Committee said the report expected on Monday from the House Intelligence Committee panel will describe `` ' a months-long effort in which President Trump again sought foreign interference in our elections for his personal and political benefit at the expense of our national interest ' '' and engaged in `` an unprecedented campaign of obstruction in an effort to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony . ''\nNadler also wrote a letter to House Judiciary Committee Ranking Republican Doug Collins , similarly giving Collins a deadline to submit any request for presenting evidence and issuing subpoenas .
