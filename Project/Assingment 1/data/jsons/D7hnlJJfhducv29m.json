    "content": "Trump \u2019 s victory should usher in policies rooted in patriotic assimilation and the national interest .\nDonald Trump \u2019 s election is above all else a rebellion of the voters against identity politics enforced by political correctness , and it opens the way to a new politics of moderate levels of immigration , patriotic assimilation , and , in foreign policy , the defense of U.S. sovereignty . In the past few months , Trump put together a winning electoral coalition that stressed the unity and common interests of all Americans across the full spectrum of policy , from immigration to diplomacy .\nBecause of Trump \u2019 s electoral success , this combination of policies rooted in the national interest and patriotism has suddenly begun to sound like common sense .
