Click here\n\nTeachers with guns and buyback programs\n\nA majority of Americans do not think Congress should pass legislation to allow schoolteachers to carry guns, 57% to 37%, and they are split on whether there should be a mandatory buyback program of assault-style weapons (45% are in favor; 46% are against).\n\nAgain, there are sharp divides \u2014 Democrats and independents are against allowing teachers to carry guns in schools, but Republicans are in favor of it. Independents swing toward Republicans, however, when it comes to mandatory buyback programs of assault-style guns, which they do not think Congress should pass.\n\nTwo-thirds of women are against Congress passing legislation to allow teachers to have guns in schools, while men are evenly divided (50% are against it; 45% are in favor).\n\nWhen it comes to whether Congress should create a mandatory gun buyback program, 55% of women think it should, but 61% of men don't want to see that.\n\nAnd a strong majority of gun owners (61%) are against buyback programs.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe survey of 1,314 adults was conducted with live callers via telephone by The Marist Poll and has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points.
