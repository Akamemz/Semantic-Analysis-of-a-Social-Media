    "content": "The Secret Service is running into problems affording the expansive protection for President Trump \u2019 s family , though the agency says the funding crunch is hardly unique to this White House .\nUSA Today reported Monday that the Secret Service could \u201c no longer afford to pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission \u201d due to the Trump family \u2019 s size , his multiple residences , and frequent travel . According to the report , under the Trump administration , 42 people have protection \u2014 18 of whom are family members \u2014 compared to the 31 people with protection under the Obama administration .\nBut according to Secret Service Director Randolph \u201c Tex \u201d Alles , the problem of tight overtime funding is an ongoing issue .\n\u201c This issue is not one that can be attributed to the current Administration \u2019 s protection requirements , but rather has been an ongoing issue for nearly a decade due to an overall increase in operational tempo , \u201d Alles said in a statement on Monday .\nThe Secret Service has been stretched particularly thin since the 2016 presidential election , with little break in the first seven months of the Trump administration . The president has traveled numerous times to his multiple properties along the East Coast in Florida , New Jersey , and Virginia , and his adult children have traveled across the country and overseas .\n\u201c The president has a large family , and our responsibility is required in law , \u201d Alles told USA Today . \u201c I can \u2019 t change that . I have no flexibility . \u201d\nLater Monday morning , Alles said in a statement to Fox News that the Secret Service has \u201c the funding it needs to meet all current mission requirements \u201d this year and to \u201c compensate employees for overtime within statutory pay caps . \u201d\nHowever , he acknowledged he expects 1,100 Secret Service employees to work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps during 2017 . He said the administration has been working with Congress to find another `` legislative solution , '' after having done so last year .\nChairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , told Fox News that he and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , are indeed \u201c working on a legislative remedy . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Cummings and I have spoken twice this morning about our mutual desire to see the Secret Service funded and the agents treated fairly while acknowledging the difficult and important job they have , \u201d Gowdy said in a statement to Fox News .\nAlles said that the USSS was faced with a \u201c similar situation \u201d in 2016 that first triggered the push for legislation allowing employees to exceed statutory caps on pay .\nFormer Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah , sponsored that legislation -- signed into law in December 2016 -- to provide \u201c relief \u201d to agents who worked \u201c record numbers of hours \u201d during the election season . The legislation only addressed that budget cycle , however .\nBut Chaffetz , now a Fox News contributor , slammed the USA Today report blaming the Trump family for the Secret Service funding crunch as \u201c hogwash . \u201d\n\u201c The fundamental problem is that they are still understaffed by nearly 1,000 agents , and the consequence is the people that are there have to work more hours than they ever should be scheduled to work , \u201d Chaffetz told Fox News . \u201c You don \u2019 t want an agent who \u2019 s been on the job for 12 hours a day for 30 days in a row standing guard on the president\u2014that \u2019 s not good for anyone . \u201d\nChaffetz told Fox News that with his legislation , more than $ 20 million was approved for Secret Service agents who worked overtime and \u201c earned \u201d the money . Chaffetz said the average agent received $ 20,000 in overtime pay for 2016 .\n\u201c This was supposed to be a one-time recognition of a problem that still hasn \u2019 t been fixed and that is that they are dramatically understaffed , \u201d Chaffetz said , adding that the agency is losing agents due to a \u201c horrific culture \u201d and \u201c lack of accountability , \u201d blaming the Obama administration for mismanagement .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to protect the president of the United States 24/7 , 365 days a year no matter where in the world he is and they need to be able to deal with it , \u201d Chaffetz said . \u201c Malia Obama went to South America for months and that was exceptionally expensive for Secret Service , but nobody complained about that . \u201d\nIn addition to working with Congress on legislative solutions , Alles said in the statement that the agency is continuing \u201c its rigorous hiring \u201d of special agents , Uniformed Division officers , and critical support staff .",
