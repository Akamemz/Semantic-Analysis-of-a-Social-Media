    "content": "The 2018 women 's U.S. Open final ended in unsettling fashion and controversy Saturday night , with both the winner and loser choking back sobs after an explosive sequence of events unlike anything witnessed in recent memory . Serena Williams was defeated in two sets by 20-year-old Japanese player Naomi Osaka , narrowly missing a chance to tie the all-time record for Grand Slam singles titles .\nWilliams ' defeat came after she was issued a questionable code violation for receiving coaching . She was then docked a point for breaking her racket , followed by a pivotal penalty in which she gave up a game because she accused the chair umpire of lying .\nRarely , if ever , have we seen Serena Williams , arguably the best player to ever step on the court , reduced to tears during a match . We 've seen her fiery . We 've seen her enraged . But eye filled with tears , voice cracking , as she defiantly defends her position and demands the respect she has more than earned ? This was new .\nSparring repeatedly with chair umpire Carlos Ramos , Williams refused to back down , and in doing so , highlighted the double standard in expectations and discipline that exists for men and women on the biggest stages in professional tennis . Several of her male peers took to Twitter to lament the unfortunate discrepancy .\nWorst refereeing I \u2019 ve ever seen ...... the worst ! ! ! \u2014 andyroddick ( @ andyroddick ) September 8 , 2018\nI will admit I have said worse and not gotten penalized . And I \u2019 ve also been given a \u201c soft warning \u201d by the ump where they tell you knock it off or I will have to give you a violation . He should have at least given her that courtesy . Sad to mar a well played final that way . https : //t.co/xhBzFZX8Wq \u2014 James Blake ( @ JRBlake ) September 9 , 2018\nNo matter how you think professional athletes should behave , Williams is right to be angry . Male players are often excused \u2014 celebrated , even \u2014 for putting their emotions on display in the heat of the moment . In fact , Ramos \u2014 the very same umpire who penalized Williams a game for calling him a `` thief '' and accusing him of lying \u2014 has tolerated similar , and arguably worse , outbursts from male players on numerous occasions .\nAt the 2016 French Open , Australian player Nick Kyrgios blew up at Ramos after he was given a warning for raising his voice at a ballboy . `` That 's bulls * * t. Are you kidding ? '' Kyrgios shouted at the official . `` Bulls * * t , f * * * ing bulls * * t. '' He was given neither a point penalty , nor a game penalty .\nAt the 2017 French Open , former world No . 1 Rafael Nadal threatened Ramos , `` Give me the warnings you can , because you will not referee me anymore , '' he said . Nadal referenced his comments in a post-match press conference . No penalties were given .\n\u201c Give me the warnings you can because you will not referee me any more. \u201d Rafael Nadal to Carlos Ramos . Not surprisingly , no point taken against Nadal . Thanks Ramos and \u2066 @ usopen\u2069 for this master class on what it costs to be an assertive black woman . https : //t.co/GFchpFmiga \u2014 AnnieEllison ( @ AnnieEllison ) September 8 , 2018\nThat same tournament , defending champion Novak Djokovic got into an impassioned argument with Ramos , approaching the chair to tell him , `` You 're losing your mind . '' The skirmish came after Djokovic was docked a first serve for taking too long in the fourth set . He glowered at Ramos , motioned with his racket while uttering something in Serbian , then approached the chair to call the official 's sanity into question .\nWhile Djokovic was issued a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct , he was never officially penalized and ultimately went on to stage a five-set comeback . Perhaps Ramos considered Djokovic and Nadal 's outbursts as somehow less offensive than that of Serena Williams . Perhaps there is some sort of subconscious bias at play . But these sort of double standards extend far beyond a single chair umpire . They have been rampant for decades .\nDuring a semifinals match at the 2016 Cincinnati Masters in Ohio , British tennis star Andy Murray quite literally kicked a ball at the chair umpire 's head . And despite the ATP rulebook clearly stating that `` players shall not violently , dangerously or with anger hit , kick or throw a tennis ball while on the grounds of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match , '' Murray was not disqualified . The umpire simply hit him with a pointed look and Murray went on to win the match , advancing to the final .\nAt the 1991 U.S. Open , five-time champion Jimmy Connors got into a series of heated exchanges with chair umpire David Littlefield . Connors called Littlefield 's decisions `` bull crap '' and repeatedly shouted that Littlefield himself was `` an abortion . '' After each of Connors ' tirades , the crowd can be heard enthusiastically cheering along with him . Littlefield can be seen raising his eyebrows , occasionally extending prolonged , disapproving glances in Connors ' direction , but otherwise remaining measured and letting the outbursts slide . No penalties are given . No points taken . No games sacrificed . Connors goes on to win the match .\nPerhaps even more indicative of the gender disparity in this arena , is the fact that , at the start of the match , the CBS Sports commentator can be heard nonchalantly predicting , `` There will be some shouting and some emotional moments in this one . ''\nFor male players fired up by the heat of competition , this sort of behavior is simply shrugged off as normal . A testosterone-driven reality of the game . If you are one of the world 's top athletes , you have spent your entire life preparing for the highest level of competition . You have pushed your body to its limit . Of course you will become emotional when a pivotal point is on the line . Of course you will shout and call the umpire names . Those very same qualities got you to the top in the first place .\nIn fact , trash-talking is tolerated among male athletes in all sports . For athletes like MMA fighter Conor McGregor and NBA forward Draymond Green , it 's become an integral part of their persona . But when Hope Solo called the Swedish national team `` a bunch of cowards '' after a heated Women 's World Cup match , she was banned from U.S. soccer . Male athletes have done far worse and are still allowed to return . Numerous NFL players like Adrian Peterson , Michael Vick and Ray Lewis , have weathered controversies over child abuse , dog fighting and even a murder case , returning to multi-million dollar contracts and , in the case of Lewis , being inducted into the Hall of Fame .\nUnlike Solo , whose entire career and legacy were torpedoed by an instance of disciplined trash-talking , male players who achieve notoriety on the same grounds often go on to fame and fortune despite their unsportsmanlike behavior . What could serve as a better example than the fact that John McEnroe can be heard as a commentator in the Connors match above ?\nAfter years of quietly frustrating women around the world , this year 's Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 and the U.S. Open in particular \u2014 have thrust the issue of sexism in sports to the forefront . First , there was the controversy over Williams ' medically necessitated catsuit at the French Open . Then there was the penalty issued to Alize Cornet for taking off her shirt in the scorching heat at the U.S. Open , after her male peers were permitted to sit on the court shirtless for prolonged periods of time . Now Serena Williams has been fined 17,000 dollars for Saturday night 's polarizing code violations .\nThe stakes are dramatically high for all female athletes . However , they are even higher for Williams , who is barely a year out from nearly dying during childbirth , after yet again having to go above and beyond to be given equal treatment and receive the medical attention she desperately needed .\nSo , yes . She 's emotional . She 's frustrated . Williams is at , quite literally , the most important and hard-fought moment of her career , with the weight of viral ad campaigns and young players everywhere on her shoulders . The amount of criticism , disrespect and hardship she has overcome to dominate this sport would be enough to break other players , yet she has consistently proven herself in the face of it all .\nSo when she 's accused of cheating , of course she is angry . Who would n't be ? And when that accusation creates a domino effect that culminates in penalties dealt far less frequently to her male counterparts ? Of course she wants to scream at the top of her lungs .\nOn Saturday night , Naomi Osaka may have won the trophy , but tennis lost . And now sports fans across the globe are simply hoping this is the break point .",
