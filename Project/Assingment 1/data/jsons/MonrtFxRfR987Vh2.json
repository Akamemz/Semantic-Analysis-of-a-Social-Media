Bush \u2019 s foreign policy may have come in the form of a Republican ex-senator from Nebraska .\nChuck Hagel \u2019 s nomination for secretary of defense has stirred opposition on both the left and the right , but the most vehement objections have come from the conservative , interventionist foreign policy community \u2014 the so-called neoconservatives who created the ideological architecture for the wars Bush launched in Afghanistan and Iraq .\nFor much of President Barack Obama \u2019 s time in office , right-leaning foreign policy leaders have taken heart from his extension of key Bush policies . Obama has wound down both wars , but he also retained Bush \u2019 s last defense secretary , Robert Gates ; kept open the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay ; massively stepped up the use of drones and added troops to the war in Afghanistan before more recently drawing back .\nWhile Obama has cast his administration as a clean break with the past , there has been much in his record for the right to like . Republicans even sought some credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden , arguing that Bush-backed interrogation tactics may have helped bring down the Al Qaeda kingpin .\nThe Hagel nomination is different \u2014 and may represent the president \u2019 s most dramatic turn away from the national security tenets of his predecessor .\nAt least on a symbolic level , Hagel represents a newly sharp break with the policies of the Bush administration , a clear rejection of Bush-style unilateralism and aggressiveness abroad . He has criticized proposals for using force against Iran , opposed Bush \u2019 s troop surge in Iraq , called for talks with Hamas and rejected little-challenged staples of foreign policy like the Cuba embargo .\nIf some liberals have criticized Obama for nominating a Republican with a questionable record on gay rights and climate change , others are touting his nomination as a delightfully blunt dismissal of the sacred cows of post-Sept. 11 conservative foreign policy .\n\u201c Obviously , [ the Hagel nomination ] is reigniting the whole \u2018 neocon versus the rest of the world \u2019 debate about , when is the appropriate use of force called for , \u201d said former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey , whose comeback Senate bid Hagel crossed party lines to endorse last year . \u201c Twenty years ago , Chuck was a mainstream conservative when it came to foreign policy . Today , he \u2019 s being described both by conservative friends of Israel and a group loosely defined as neocons , as more on the left . \u201d\nOne Democratic foreign policy strategist cast the Hagel choice as a \u201c break from Bush-era thinking because it is a repudiation of the neoconservative movement . \u201d\n\u201c He is the anti-neocon , \u201d the Democrat said , calling Hagel a throwback to a more moderate age of Republican foreign policy . \u201c The GOP has two security camps , right ? Neoconservatives \u2014 [ Arizona Sen. John ] McCain , [ former Connecticut Sen. Joe ] Lieberman , [ South Carolina Sen. Lindsey ] Graham \u2014 and isolationists [ like Kentucky Sen. ] Rand Paul . Hagel \u2019 s camp doesn \u2019 t exist anymore ; they all switched teams . A repudiation of Bush ? Sure , but also a dramatic demonstration of how much Republican national security thinking has changed because of Bush . \u201d\nRetired Gen. Wesley Clark , the former NATO supreme allied commander and Democratic presidential candidate , said the Hagel nomination wasn \u2019 t \u201c a particular push on an ideology , \u201d but suggested the right flank of the foreign policy community had gone out on a limb by attacking the nomination .\n\u201c It was the kind of opposition that \u2019 s like a show of strength , by a group in the Republican Party who are associated with strong and conservative national security positions . OK , they \u2019 ve made their statement , \u201d Clark said . \u201c Now they \u2019 re going to have to deal with Sen. Hagel the man himself . \u201d\n\u201c The fact that he \u2019 s had reservations about how force is used and so forth , that shows his thoughtfulness , \u201d said Clark , who noted that the Obama administration has hardly been reserved in its use of drone strikes or its commitment to the war in Afghanistan .\nOf course , Obama didn \u2019 t choose Hagel as one final attack on his predecessor , nor has it taken Obama four years to turn the page on the Bush foreign policy in significant ways . The White House has presented the decorated Vietnam veteran as the ideal man to lead the Pentagon through a difficult time : an independent thinker who has lived through combat and who won \u2019 t be intimidated by generals in uniform once he takes the job .\nTo the extent there \u2019 s a larger takeaway from the nomination , foreign policy veterans said it is likely the president has reached a point of confidence and comfort in the job that he wanted a genuine kindred spirit at the Department of Defense .\nIt \u2019 s only natural that a defense secretary choice who \u2019 s explicitly in line with Obama \u2019 s thinking would also represent an overt rejection of Bush , even if that nominee happened to serve in office as a Republican .\n\u201c I see [ the nomination ] as Obama liberated from politics and confident in his own decision-making abilities now , too , choosing someone who he just genuinely likes and respects , \u201d said Brookings Institution scholar Michael O \u2019 Hanlon . \u201c And perhaps also Hagel \u2019 s reticence to use force is particularly useful in light of where the Iran \u2014 and Syria \u2014 files may go . \u201d\nOne former Republican Cabinet official offered this read on the Hagel nomination : \u201c It sends a message that Obama wants a guy who is not going to stand and fight on budget levels and wants to get out of Afghanistan as quickly as he does . \u201d\n\u201c To me , he \u2019 s exactly the sort of person that I think Obama would pick , \u201d the Republican said . \u201c His problem is that he is seen by the Republicans as just a total opportunist who switched sides when it was in his own interests . Not that that \u2019 s anything new in Washington . \u201d\nStill , the conservative opposition to Hagel exceeds \u2014 in volume and intensity \u2014 almost any other national security uproar of Obama \u2019 s first term . And the criticism is more substantive than most Republican attacks on Obama \u2019 s foreign and national security policy . ( At the height of the 2012 campaign , GOP candidate Mitt Romney struggled to explain how he \u2019 d handle conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya differently , except that he \u2019 d be stronger than Obama in some hard-to-define way . )\nThe groups blasting Hagel \u2019 s nomination , such as the Emergency Committee for Israel , see him not just as one more data point in a flawed Obama foreign policy but as the most brazen attack yet on long-untouchable tenets of center-right foreign policy .\n\u201c Take every hot button issue on foreign policy \u2014 Iran , defense spending , Israel , Cuba , sanctions , negotiating with terrorist groups \u2014 and Hagel has found a way to both alienate and unify the people who care about these issues , \u201d said Brian Hook , a former assistant secretary of state under Bush . \u201c It \u2019 s a remarkable feat . I don \u2019 t think this was a politically smart nomination given the many substantive concerns it presents . \u201d\nPete Hegseth , the conservative Iraq War veteran who heads Concerned Veterans for America , said it is hard to explain the nomination except \u201c there is a personal \u2018 I like him , and we both opposed Iraq \u2019 angle . There is no other serious or rational reason for the pick . \u201d\n\u201c Objections to Sen.
