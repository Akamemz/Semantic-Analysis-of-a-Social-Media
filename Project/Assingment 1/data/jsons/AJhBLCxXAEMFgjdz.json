    "content": "LONDON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - It was early spring when British scientists laid out the bald truth to their government . It was \u201c highly likely , \u201d they said , that there was now \u201c sustained transmission \u201d of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom .\nIf unconstrained and if the virus behaved as in China , up to four-fifths of Britons could be infected and one in a hundred might die , wrote the scientists , members of an official committee set up to model the spread of pandemic flu , on March 2 . Their assessment didn \u2019 t spell it out , but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million .\nYet the next day , March 3 , Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self . He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone , including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients .\n\u201c Our country remains extremely well prepared , \u201d Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths . \u201c We already have a fantastic NHS , \u201d the national public health service , \u201c fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease . \u201d\nAlongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty , the government \u2019 s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist . Whitty passed on the modelling committee \u2019 s broad conclusions , including the prediction of a possible 80 % infection rate and the consequent deaths . But he played them down , saying the number of people who would be infected was probably \u201c a lot lower \u201d and coming up with a total was \u201c largely speculative . \u201d\nThe upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government \u2019 s scientific advisers behind the scenes . They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation has found .\nInterviews with more than 20 British scientists , key officials and senior sources in Johnson \u2019 s Conservative Party , and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents , show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating .\nBut the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months , the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government . Until March 12 , the risk level , set by the government \u2019 s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists , remained at \u201c moderate , \u201d suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak .\n\u201c You know , there \u2019 s a small little cadre of people in the middle , who absolutely did realise what was going on , and likely to happen , \u201d said John Edmunds , a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government , known for his work on tracking Ebola . Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier .\nFrom the outset , said Edmunds , work by scientists had shown that , with only limited interventions , the virus would trigger an \u201c overwhelming epidemic \u201d in which Britain \u2019 s health service was not going \u201c to get anywhere near being able to cope with it . That was clear from the beginning . \u201d\nBut he said : \u201c I do think there \u2019 s a bit of a worry in terms you don \u2019 t want to unnecessarily panic people . \u201d\nJohnson , who himself has sickened with the virus , moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown . He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds . Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day .\nIt is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK \u2019 s early response . If history concludes that it was lacking , then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that , rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers , he failed to question their assumptions .\nInterviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn \u2019 t study , until mid-March , the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China , where the disease arose in December , and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself . The scientists \u2019 reasoning : Britons , many of them assumed , simply wouldn \u2019 t accept such restrictions .\nThe UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that , once the new virus escaped China , quarantine measures would likely not succeed . Minutes of technical committees reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing . Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease . The scientists involved , however , deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference .\nNow , as countries debate how to combat the virus , some experts here say , the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge .\nJohn Ashton , a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England , the government agency overseeing healthcare , said the government \u2019 s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions . They were too \u201c narrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions , \u201d he said . Their handling of COVID-19 , Ashton said , shows the need for a broader approach . \u201c In the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers . \u201d\nMichael Cates , who succeeded Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University , is leading an initiative by the Royal Society , the UK \u2019 s leading scientific body , to bring modellers in from other scientific disciplines to help understand the epidemic .\n\u201c Without faulting anyone so far , it \u2019 s vital , where there is such a lot at stake , to throw the maximum possible light on the methods , assumptions and data built into our understanding of how this epidemic will develop , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was delivering \u201c a science-led action plan \u201d to contain the outbreak . \u201c As the public would expect , we regularly test our pandemic plans and what we learned from previous exercises has helped us to rapidly respond to COVID-19 . \u201d\nWhen news came from China in January of a new infectious disease , Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared . It had some of the world \u2019 s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics . Perhaps , some scientists say in hindsight , the plan made them slow to adapt .\nFor many years , the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister \u2019 s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously . Presciently , it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country , ahead of terrorism and financial crashes .\nAt the centre of planning was a small group of scientists , among them Edmunds . His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy . The other is at nearby Imperial College . Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak , the data from China were sketchy , in the period \u201c where the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn \u2019 t transmissible between humans . \u201d\nEdmunds and his colleague at Imperial , Neil Ferguson , were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister . Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee , known as SPI-M , that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths . This committee had met together for nearly 15 years .\nFerguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article .\nEdmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG , the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group . Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , known as SAGE , that advises the government in times of crisis . SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government \u2019 s main emergency committee , COBRA .\nAt first , when NERVTAG met on January 13 , it studied information from China that there was \u201c no evidence of significant human to human transmission \u201d of the new virus , according to minutes of the meeting . The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was \u201c very low . \u201d\nThe evidence soon changed , but this wasn \u2019 t reflected in the official threat level . By the end of January , scientists in China began releasing clinical data . Case studies published in the British medical journal , The Lancet , showed 17 % of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care . Eleven patients died . Another Chinese study , in the same magazine , warned starkly of a global spread and urged : \u201c Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally . \u201d\nEdmunds recalled that \u201c from about mid January onwards , it was absolutely obvious that this was serious , very serious. \u201d Graham Medley , a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M , agreed . He said that the committee was \u201c clear that this was going to be big from the first meeting. \u201d At the end of January , his committee moved into \u201c wartime \u201d mode , he said , reporting directly into SAGE .\nDr Jon Read , a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster , also a member of SPI-M , said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had \u201c pandemic potential \u201d and that death rates for the elderly were brutal . \u201c From my perspective within the sort of modelling community , everybody \u2019 s aware of this , and we \u2019 re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad , \u201d he said .\nBut the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government , minutes of committee meetings reveal .\nOn January 21 , scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from \u201c very low \u201d to \u201c low. \u201d SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat . So did COBRA , which was chaired by Matt Hancock , the health secretary , who would contract the virus himself in late March . He told reporters after the meeting : \u201c The clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low . \u201d\nIn response to questions from \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the government \u2019 s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action , if any , they trigger . In a statement , a spokesperson said : \u201c Increasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities . \u201d\nTwo days later , China put the city of Wuhan , where the outbreak began , into a complete lockdown . Hubei , the surrounding province , would follow . But already , 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020 , and 614 flights from the whole of China , according to FlightRadar24 , a flight-tracking service . That meant thousands of Chinese , some of them potential carriers , had come to Britain . On April 5 , scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected .\nAs they watched China impose its lockdown , the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK . Among those modelling the outbreak , such stringent counter-measures were not , at first , examined .\n\u201c We had milder interventions in place , \u201d said Edmunds , because no one thought it would be acceptable politically \u201c to shut the country down. \u201d He added : \u201c We didn \u2019 t model it because it didn \u2019 t seem to be on the agenda . And Imperial ( College ) didn \u2019 t look at it either. \u201d The NERVTAG committee agreed , noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless , as they \u201c would only delay the UK outbreak , not prevent it . \u201d\nThat limited approach mirrored the UK \u2019 s longstanding pandemic flu strategy . The Department of Health declined a request from \u2588\u2588\u2588 for a copy of its updated pandemic plan , without providing a reason . But a copy of the 2011 \u201c UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 , \u201d which a spokesman said was still relevant , stated the \u201c working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions . The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness . \u201d\nAccording to one senior Conservative Party politician , who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded , the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a \u201c cognitive bias . \u201d\n\u201c We had in our minds that COVID-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such , \u201d he said . \u201c The implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly . \u201d\nWhile the UK was prepared to fight the flu , Asian states like China , Hong Kong , Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002 , he said . SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14 % . As a result , these countries , he said , were more ready to resort to widespread testing , lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus .\nScientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government \u2019 s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak \u2019 s course . The plan had a \u201c reasonable worst case \u201d scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for COVID-19 , they note .\nMark Woolhouse , a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh , and a member of the SPI-M committee , said COVID-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus . But , broadly , \u201c the government has been consistently responsive to changing facts . \u201d\nBy the end of January , the government \u2019 s chief medical adviser , Whitty , was explaining to politicians in private , according to at least two people who spoke to him , that if the virus escaped China , it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain . It could only be slowed down , not stopped . On Jan 30 , the government raised the threat level to \u201c moderate \u201d from \u201c low . \u201d\nThe country \u2019 s medical officers \u201c consider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak , \u201d a statement said at the time . Whitty did not respond to questions from \u2588\u2588\u2588 for this article .\nOn the evening of January 31 , Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation , in a televised address : \u201c This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama . \u201d\nHe was talking of finally delivering Brexit , or what he called \u201c this recaptured sovereignty. \u201d Until that moment , Johnson \u2019 s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge .\nWith Brexit done , Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month , among them the emerging virus threat . But leaving the European Union had a consequence .\nBetween February 13 and March 30 , Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join . Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials , it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators , to which it was invited . Ventilators , vitally important to treating the direst cases of COVID-19 , have fallen into short supply globally . Johnson \u2019 s spokesman blamed an administrative error .\nA Downing Street aide told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that from around the end of January , Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat , receiving \u201c very frequent \u201d updates at least once per day from mid February , either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases .\nIn the medical and scientific world , there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK . A report from Exeter University , published on February 12 , warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and , without mitigation , infect 45 million people .\nThat worried Rahuldeb Sarkar , a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent , who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped . Even if disease transmission was reduced by half , he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February , a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would \u201c have a chance of overwhelming the system . \u201d\nWith Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an \u201c if , not a when , \u201d Richard Horton , a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet , said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests , and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care .\nCalling the lost chance a \u201c national scandal \u201d in a later editorial , he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between \u201c the urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China \u201d and the \u201c somewhat pedestrian evaluation \u201d of the threat from the scientific advice to the government .\nAfter developing a test for the new virus by January 10 , health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment , initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests . But , according to later government statements , there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country , both public and private , that could have been recruited .\nAccording to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March , when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments , used in testing . An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February . But the call never came .\n\u201c You would have thought that they would be bashing down the door , \u201d said the executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity . By April 5 , Britain had carried out 195,524 tests , in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany .\nNor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators . The Department of Health told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February . But it was not until March 16 , after it was clear supplies could run out , that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production .\nCharles Bellm , managing director of Intersurgical , a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London , said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world , including France , New Zealand and Indonesia . But there had been no contact from the British government . \u201c I find it somewhat surprising , I have spoken to a lot of other governments , \u201d he said .\nCountering such criticism , Hancock , the health minister , said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks . One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing , he said , was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic . \u201c We didn \u2019 t have the scale . \u201d\nIt was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed .\nFor weeks now , doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China . Longley , an infectious diseases consultant at London \u2019 s Hospital for Tropical Diseases , was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms . The plan , she said , had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts . And \u201c to start with , it looked like it was working . \u201d\nBut then , bad news . First , on Wednesday the 19th of February , came the shock news from Iran of two deaths . Then , on Friday the 21st , came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions . Britain has close links to both countries . Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy , \u201d Longley said . \u201c And I think , the minute everybody saw that , we thought : \u2018 This is game over now . \u2019 \u201d\nUntil then , Longley said , everyone felt \u201c there was a chance to stamp it out \u201d even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term . But after Iran and Italy , it was obvious containment would not work . The contact tracing continued for a while . But as the cases in London built up , and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed , the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases . \u201c At a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce . \u201d\nEdmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point . \u201c And then , all of sudden you had deaths recorded. \u201d There was a rule of thumb that , in an outbreak \u2019 s early stages , for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community . \u201c And so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy , possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then . \u201d\nAmid the dreadful news from Italy , the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday , 21st February . But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at \u201c moderate , \u201d where it had sat since January 30th . The minutes don \u2019 t give a detailed explanation of the decision . Edmunds , who had technical difficulties and couldn \u2019 t be heard on the call , emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to \u201c high , \u201d the minutes revealed . But the warning level remained lower . It \u2019 s unclear why .\n\u201c I just thought , are we still , we still thinking that it \u2019 s mild or something ? It definitely isn \u2019 t , you know , \u201d said Edmunds .\nA spokesman for the government \u2019 s chief scientific adviser , Sir Patrick Vallance , didn \u2019 t directly respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 questions about the threat level . Asked whether , with hindsight , the scientists \u2019 approach was the right one , the spokesperson said in a statement that \u201c SAGE and advisers provide advice , while Ministers and the Government make decisions . \u201d\nOn Sunday , March 1st , Ferguson , Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded . By now , Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care .\nThe following day , pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its \u201c consensus report \u201d that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK . That Thursday , March 5 , the first death in the UK was announced . Italy , which reached 827 deaths by March 11 , ordered a national lockdown . Spain and France prepared to follow suit .\nJohnson held out against stringent measures , saying he was following the advice of the government \u2019 s scientists . He asserted on March 9 : \u201c We are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak , based on the very latest scientific and medical advice . \u201d\nIndeed , the government \u2019 s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , SAGE , had recommended that day , with no dissension recorded in its summary , that the UK reject a China-style lockdown . SAGE decided that \u201c implementing a subset of measures would be ideal , \u201d according to a record of its conclusions . Tougher measures could create a \u201c large second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted , \u201d SAGE said .\nOn March 12 came a bombshell for the British public . Chris Whitty , the chief medical officer , announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from \u201c moderate \u201d to \u201c high. \u201d And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread . New cases were not going to be tracked at all . \u201c It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case , \u201d he said . Only hospital cases would , in future , be tested for the virus . What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open : beyond a certain point , attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop .\nThe same day , putting aside his jokey self , Johnson made a speech in Downing Street , flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill \u2019 s \u201c darkest hour \u201d address . He warned : \u201c I must level with you , level with the British public - more families , many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time . \u201d\nFor most Britons , it came as a shock . Several of the next day \u2019 s newspapers splashed Johnson \u2019 s words on their front pages .\nVallance , the government \u2019 s chief scientific adviser , who chaired SAGE , said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection . The government had , for now , rejected what he called \u201c eye-catching measures \u201d like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools . The \u201c aim is to try and reduce the peak , broaden the peak , not to suppress it completely. \u201d Most people would get the virus mildly , and this would build up \u201c herd immunity \u201d which , in time , would stop the disease \u2019 s progress .\nBut by now , the country was rebelling . Major institutions decided to close . After players began to get infected , the professional football leagues suspended their games . As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings , the Daily Mirror \u2019 s banner headline , summing up a widespread feeling , asked on March 13 : \u201c Is It Enough ? \u201d\nThe catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson \u2019 s Imperial College team . It predicted that , unconstrained , the virus could kill 510,000 people . Even the government \u2019 s \u201c mitigation \u201d approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over .\nImperial \u2019 s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government \u2019 s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier . Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around , both in London and in Washington , culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain . The report also jarred the U.S. administration into tougher measures to slow the virus \u2019 spread .\nFerguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus . Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament , he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown , the NHS would be overwhelmed . The reason , he said , lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care .\n\u201c The revision was that , basically , estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation , mechanical ventilation , which is only done in a critical care unit , roughly doubled , \u201d he said .\nWhat allowed Britain to alter course , said Edmunds , was a lockdown in Italy that \u201c opened up the policy space \u201d coupled with new data . First came a paper by Edmunds \u2019 own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns , sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University . Ferguson \u2019 s revised Imperial research followed .\nEdmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures , perhaps relaxed periodically , then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced .\nStill , without a vaccine or effective treatments , it \u2019 s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected , said Edmunds . \u201c Until you get to a vaccine , there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths , \u201d he said . \u201c And probably more than that . \u201d\nNow subject to intense public scrutiny , the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus \u2019 s clutches . According to Medley , the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee , no one now doubts , for all the initial reservations , that a lockdown was essential in Britain .\nMedley added : \u201c At the moment we don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen in six months . All we know is that unless we stop transmission now , the health service will collapse . Yep , that \u2019 s the only thing we know for sure . \u201d",

Their assessment didn\u2019t spell it out, but that was a prediction of over 500,000 deaths in this nation of nearly 70 million.\n\nYet the next day, March 3, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was his cheery self. He joked that he was still shaking hands with everyone, including at a hospital treating coronavirus patients.\n\n\u201cOur country remains extremely well prepared,\u201d Johnson said as Italy reached 79 deaths. \u201cWe already have a fantastic NHS,\u201d the national public health service, \u201cfantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d\n\nAlongside him at the Downing Street press conference was Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser and himself an epidemiologist. Whitty passed on the modelling committee\u2019s broad conclusions, including the prediction of a possible 80% infection rate and the consequent deaths. But he played them down, saying the number of people who would be infected was probably \u201ca lot lower\u201d and coming up with a total was \u201clargely speculative.\u201d\n\nThe upbeat tone of that briefing stood in sharp contrast with the growing unease of many of the government\u2019s scientific advisers behind the scenes. They were already convinced that Britain was on the brink of a disastrous outbreak, a Reuters investigation has found.\n\nInterviews with more than 20 British scientists, key officials and senior sources in Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, and a study of minutes of advisory committee meetings and public testimony and documents, show how these scientific advisers concluded early the virus could be devastating.\n\nBut the interviews and documents also reveal that for more than two months, the scientists whose advice guided Downing Street did not clearly signal their worsening fears to the public or the government. Until March 12, the risk level, set by the government\u2019s top medical advisers on the recommendation of the scientists, remained at \u201cmoderate,\u201d suggesting only the possibility of a wider outbreak.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s a small little cadre of people in the middle, who absolutely did realise what was going on, and likely to happen,\u201d said John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling and a key adviser to the government, known for his work on tracking Ebola. Edmunds was among those who did call on the government to elevate the warning level earlier.\n\nFrom the outset, said Edmunds, work by scientists had shown that, with only limited interventions, the virus would trigger an \u201coverwhelming epidemic\u201d in which Britain\u2019s health service was not going \u201cto get anywhere near being able to cope with it. That was clear from the beginning.\u201d\n\nBut he said: \u201cI do think there\u2019s a bit of a worry in terms you don\u2019t want to unnecessarily panic people.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who himself has sickened with the virus, moved more slowly than the leaders of many other prosperous countries to adopt a lockdown. He has been criticised for not moving more swiftly to organise mass tests and mobilise supplies of life-saving equipment and beds. Johnson was hospitalized on April 5 and moved to intensive care the next day.\n\nIt is too soon to judge the ultimate soundness of the UK\u2019s early response. If history concludes that it was lacking, then the criticism levelled at the prime minister may be that, rather than ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers, he failed to question their assumptions.\n\nInterviews and records published so far suggest that the scientific committees that advised Johnson didn\u2019t study, until mid-March, the option of the kind of stringent lockdown adopted early on in China, where the disease arose in December, and then followed by much of Europe and finally by Britain itself. The scientists\u2019 reasoning: Britons, many of them assumed, simply wouldn\u2019t accept such restrictions.\n\nThe UK scientists were also mostly convinced - and many still are - that, once the new virus escaped China, quarantine measures would likely not succeed. Minutes of technical committees reviewed by Reuters indicate that almost no attention was paid to preparing a programme of mass testing. Other minutes and interviews show Britain was following closely a well-laid plan to fight a flu pandemic - not this deadlier disease. The scientists involved, however, deny that the flu focus ultimately made much difference.\n\nNow, as countries debate how to combat the virus, some experts here say, the lesson from the British experience may be that governments and scientists worldwide must increase the transparency of their planning so that their thinking and assumptions are open to challenge.\n\nJohn Ashton, a clinician and former regional director of Public Health England, the government agency overseeing healthcare, said the government\u2019s advisers took too narrow a view and hewed to limited assumptions. They were too \u201cnarrowly drawn as scientists from a few institutions,\u201d he said. Their handling of COVID-19, Ashton said, shows the need for a broader approach. \u201cIn the future we need a much wider group of independent advisers.\u201d\n\nMichael Cates, who succeeded Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, is leading an initiative by the Royal Society, the UK\u2019s leading scientific body, to bring modellers in from other scientific disciplines to help understand the epidemic.\n\n\u201cWithout faulting anyone so far, it\u2019s vital, where there is such a lot at stake, to throw the maximum possible light on the methods, assumptions and data built into our understanding of how this epidemic will develop,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was delivering \u201ca science-led action plan\u201d to contain the outbreak. \u201cAs the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and what we learned from previous exercises has helped us to rapidly respond to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nA LOW RISK TO THE PUBLIC\n\nWhen news came from China in January of a new infectious disease, Johnson had reason to believe his country was well prepared. It had some of the world\u2019s best scientists and a well-drilled plan to deal with potentially lethal pandemics. Perhaps, some scientists say in hindsight, the plan made them slow to adapt.\n\nFor many years, the Cabinet Office - a collection of officials who act as the prime minister\u2019s direct arm to run the government - took the threat of pandemics seriously. Presciently, it rated pandemics as the Number 1 threat to the country, ahead of terrorism and financial crashes.\n\nAt the centre of planning was a small group of scientists, among them Edmunds. His research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs one of the two computer modelling centres for epidemics that have mostly driven government policy. The other is at nearby Imperial College. Edmunds remembers that early in the outbreak, the data from China were sketchy, in the period \u201cwhere the Chinese were trying to pretend that this wasn\u2019t transmissible between humans.\u201d\n\nEdmunds and his colleague at Imperial, Neil Ferguson, were part of an alphabet soup of committees that fed advice into the Cabinet Office machinery around the prime minister. Both were founders of the flu pandemic modelling committee, known as SPI-M, that produced the March 2 report warning of more than 500,000 deaths. This committee had met together for nearly 15 years.\n\nFerguson did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article.\n\nEdmunds and Ferguson were also part of NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Both too were members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE, that advises the government in times of crisis. SAGE reports directly to Johnson and the government\u2019s main emergency committee, COBRA.\n\nAt first, when NERVTAG met on January 13, it studied information from China that there was \u201cno evidence of significant human to human transmission\u201d of the new virus, according to minutes of the meeting. The scientists agreed the risk to the UK population was \u201cvery low.\u201d\n\nThe evidence soon changed, but this wasn\u2019t reflected in the official threat level. By the end of January, scientists in China began releasing clinical data. Case studies published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, showed 17% of the first 99 coronavirus cases needed critical care. Eleven patients died. Another Chinese study, in the same magazine, warned starkly of a global spread and urged: \u201cPreparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\u201d\n\nEdmunds recalled that \u201cfrom about mid January onwards, it was absolutely obvious that this was serious, very serious.\u201d Graham Medley, a professor of infectious diseases modelling at the London School and chairman of SPI-M, agreed. He said that the committee was \u201cclear that this was going to be big from the first meeting.\u201d At the end of January, his committee moved into \u201cwartime\u201d mode, he said, reporting directly into SAGE.\n\nDr Jon Read, a senior lecturer in biostatistics at the University of Lancaster, also a member of SPI-M, said by the end of January it was apparent the virus had \u201cpandemic potential\u201d and that death rates for the elderly were brutal. \u201cFrom my perspective within the sort of modelling community, everybody\u2019s aware of this, and we\u2019re saying that this is probably going to be pretty bad,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the scientists did not articulate their fears forcefully to the government, minutes of committee meetings reveal.\n\nOn January 21, scientists on NERVTAG endorsed the elevation of the UK risk warning from COVID-19 from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow.\u201d SAGE met formally for the first time the following day about the coronavirus threat. So did COBRA, which was chaired by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who would contract the virus himself in late March. He told reporters after the meeting: \u201cThe clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from Reuters, the government\u2019s Department of Health declined to clarify how the risk levels are defined or what action, if any, they trigger. In a statement, a spokesperson said: \u201cIncreasing the risk level in the UK is a belt and braces measure which allows the government to plan for all future eventualities.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, China put the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, into a complete lockdown. Hubei, the surrounding province, would follow. But already, 17 passenger flights had flown directly from Wuhan to Britain since the start of 2020, and 614 flights from the whole of China, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking service. That meant thousands of Chinese, some of them potential carriers, had come to Britain. On April 5, scientific adviser Ferguson said he estimated only one-third of infected people reaching Britain had been detected.\n\nAs they watched China impose its lockdown, the British scientists assumed that such drastic actions would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK. Among those modelling the outbreak, such stringent counter-measures were not, at first, examined.\n\n\u201cWe had milder interventions in place,\u201d said Edmunds, because no one thought it would be acceptable politically \u201cto shut the country down.\u201d He added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t model it because it didn\u2019t seem to be on the agenda. And Imperial (College) didn\u2019t look at it either.\u201d The NERVTAG committee agreed, noting in its minutes that tough measures in the short term would be pointless, as they \u201cwould only delay the UK outbreak, not prevent it.\u201d\n\nThat limited approach mirrored the UK\u2019s longstanding pandemic flu strategy. The Department of Health declined a request from Reuters for a copy of its updated pandemic plan, without providing a reason. But a copy of the 2011 \u201cUK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011,\u201d which a spokesman said was still relevant, stated the \u201cworking presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness.\u201d\n\nAccording to one senior Conservative Party politician, who was officially briefed as the crisis unfolded, the close involvement in the response to the coronavirus of the same scientific advisers and civil servants who drew up the flu plan may have created a \u201ccognitive bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had in our minds that COVID-19 was a nasty flu and needed to be treated as such,\u201d he said. \u201cThe implication was it was a disease that could not be stopped and that it was ultimately not that deadly.\u201d\n\nWhile the UK was prepared to fight the flu, Asian states like China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea had built their pandemic plans with lessons learned from fighting the more lethal SARS outbreak that began in 2002, he said. SARS had a fatality rate of up to 14%. As a result, these countries, he said, were more ready to resort to widespread testing, lockdowns and other draconian measures to keep their citizens from spreading the virus.\n\nScientists involved in the UK response disagree that following the government\u2019s flu plan clouded their thinking or influenced the outbreak\u2019s course. The plan had a \u201creasonable worst case\u201d scenario as devastating as the worst predictions for COVID-19, they note.\n\nMark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the SPI-M committee, said COVID-19 did behave differently than an expected pandemic flu - for example school closures proved to be far less effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. But, broadly, \u201cthe government has been consistently responsive to changing facts.\u201d\n\nBy the end of January, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, Whitty, was explaining to politicians in private, according to at least two people who spoke to him, that if the virus escaped China, it would in time infect the great majority of people in Britain. It could only be slowed down, not stopped. On Jan 30, the government raised the threat level to \u201cmoderate\u201d from \u201clow.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s medical officers \u201cconsider it prudent for our governments to escalate planning and preparation in case of a more widespread outbreak,\u201d a statement said at the time. Whitty did not respond to questions from Reuters for this article.\n\nA TIME TO PREPARE\n\nOn the evening of January 31, Boris Johnson sat before a fireplace in 10 Downing Street and told the nation, in a televised address: \u201cThis is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.\u201d\n\nHe was talking of finally delivering Brexit, or what he called \u201cthis recaptured sovereignty.\u201d Until that moment, Johnson\u2019s premiership had been utterly absorbed by delivering on that challenge.\n\nWith Brexit done, Johnson had the chance to focus on other matters the following month, among them the emerging virus threat. But leaving the European Union had a consequence.\n\nBetween February 13 and March 30, Britain missed a total of eight conference calls or meetings about the coronavirus between EU heads of state or health ministers - meetings that Britain was still entitled to join. Although Britain did later make an arrangement to attend lower-level meetings of officials, it had missed a deadline to participate in a common purchase scheme for ventilators, to which it was invited. Ventilators, vitally important to treating the direst cases of COVID-19, have fallen into short supply globally. Johnson\u2019s spokesman blamed an administrative error.\n\nA Downing Street aide told Reuters that from around the end of January, Johnson concentrated his attention increasingly on the coronavirus threat, receiving \u201cvery frequent\u201d updates at least once per day from mid February, either in person or via a daily dashboard of cases.\n\nIn the medical and scientific world, there was growing concern about the threat of the virus to the UK. A report from Exeter University, published on February 12, warned a UK outbreak could peak within four months and, without mitigation, infect 45 million people.\n\nThat worried Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the county of Kent, who foresaw that intensive care beds could be swamped. Even if disease transmission was reduced by half, he wrote in a report aimed at clinicians and actuaries in mid-February, a coronavirus outbreak in the UK would \u201chave a chance of overwhelming the system.\u201d\n\nWith Whitty stating in a BBC interview on February 13 that a UK outbreak was still an \u201cif, not a when,\u201d Richard Horton, a medical doctor and editor of the Lancet, said the government and public health service wasted an opportunity that month to prepare quarantine restriction measures and a programme of mass tests, and procure resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment for expanded intensive care.\n\nCalling the lost chance a \u201cnational scandal\u201d in a later editorial, he would testify to parliament about a mismatch between \u201cthe urgent warning that was coming from the frontline in China\u201d and the \u201csomewhat pedestrian evaluation\u201d of the threat from the scientific advice to the government.\n\nAfter developing a test for the new virus by January 10, health officials adopted a centralised approach to its deployment, initially assigning a single public laboratory in north London to perform the tests. But, according to later government statements, there was no wider plan envisaged to make use of hundreds of laboratories across the country, both public and private, that could have been recruited.\n\nAccording to emails and more than a dozen scientists interviewed by Reuters, the government issued no requests to labs for assistance with staff or testing equipment until the middle of March, when many abruptly received requests to hand over nucleic acid extraction instruments, used in testing. An executive at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford said he could have carried out up to 1,000 tests per day from February. But the call never came.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought that they would be bashing down the door,\u201d said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By April 5, Britain had carried out 195,524 tests, in contrast to at least 918,000 completed a week earlier in Germany.\n\nNor was there an effective effort to expand the supply of ventilators. The Department of Health told Reuters in a statement that the government started talking to manufacturers of ventilators about procuring extra supplies in February. But it was not until March 16, after it was clear supplies could run out, that Johnson launched an appeal to industry to help ramp up production.\n\nCharles Bellm, managing director of Intersurgical, a global supplier of medical ventilation products based outside London, said he has been contacted by more than a dozen governments around the world, including France, New Zealand and Indonesia. But there had been no contact from the British government. \u201cI find it somewhat surprising, I have spoken to a lot of other governments,\u201d he said.\n\nCountering such criticism, Hancock, the health minister, said the government is on track to deliver about 10,000 more ventilators in the coming weeks. One reason Britain was behind some countries on testing, he said, was the absence of a large diagnostics industry at the outbreak of the epidemic. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the scale.\u201d\n\nGAME OVER\n\nIt was during the school half-term holidays in February that frontline doctor Nicky Longley began to realise that early efforts to contain the disease were likely doomed.\n\nFor weeks now, doctors and public health workers had been watching out for people with flu-like symptoms coming in from China. Longley, an infectious diseases consultant at London\u2019s Hospital for Tropical Diseases, was part of a team that staffed a public health service helpline for those with symptoms. The plan, she said, had been to make all effort to catch every case and their contacts. And \u201cto start with, it looked like it was working.\u201d\n\nBut then, bad news. First, on Wednesday the 19th of February, came the shock news from Iran of two deaths. Then, on Friday the 21st, came a death in Italy and a bloom of cases in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Britain has close links to both countries. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy that week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really foresaw what was happening in Italy,\u201d Longley said. \u201cAnd I think, the minute everybody saw that, we thought: \u2018This is game over now.\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil then, Longley said, everyone felt \u201cthere was a chance to stamp it out\u201d even though most were sceptical it could be done long-term. But after Iran and Italy, it was obvious containment would not work. The contact tracing continued for a while. But as the cases in London built up, and the volume of calls to the helpline mushroomed, the priority began to shift to clinical care of the serious cases. \u201cAt a certain point you have to make a decision about where you put your efforts as a workforce.\u201d\n\nEdmunds noted that Iran and Italy had hardly reported a case until that point. \u201cAnd then, all of sudden you had deaths recorded.\u201d There was a rule of thumb that, in an outbreak\u2019s early stages, for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community. \u201cAnd so it was quite clear that there were at least thousands of cases in Italy, possibly tens of thousands of cases in Italy right then.\u201d\n\nAmid the dreadful news from Italy, the scientists at NERVTAG convened by phone that Friday, 21st February. But they decided to recommend keeping the threat level at \u201cmoderate,\u201d where it had sat since January 30th. The minutes don\u2019t give a detailed explanation of the decision. Edmunds, who had technical difficulties and couldn\u2019t be heard on the call, emailed afterwards to ask the warning to be elevated to \u201chigh,\u201d the minutes revealed. But the warning level remained lower. It\u2019s unclear why.\n\n\u201cI just thought, are we still, we still thinking that it\u2019s mild or something? It definitely isn\u2019t, you know,\u201d said Edmunds.\n\nA spokesman for the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, didn\u2019t directly respond to Reuters questions about the threat level. Asked whether, with hindsight, the scientists\u2019 approach was the right one, the spokesperson said in a statement that \u201cSAGE and advisers provide advice, while Ministers and the Government make decisions.\u201d\n\nHERD IMMUNITY\n\nOn Sunday, March 1st, Ferguson, Edmunds and other advisers spent the day with NHS public health service experts trying to work out how many hospital beds and other key resources would be needed as the outbreak exploded. By now, Italian data was showing that a tenth of all infected patients needed intensive care.\n\nThe following day, pandemic modelling committee SPI-M produced its \u201cconsensus report\u201d that warned the coronavirus was now transmitting freely in the UK. That Thursday, March 5, the first death in the UK was announced. Italy, which reached 827 deaths by March 11, ordered a national lockdown. Spain and France prepared to follow suit.\n\nJohnson held out against stringent measures, saying he was following the advice of the government\u2019s scientists. He asserted on March 9: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, had recommended that day, with no dissension recorded in its summary, that the UK reject a China-style lockdown. SAGE decided that \u201cimplementing a subset of measures would be ideal,\u201d according to a record of its conclusions. Tougher measures could create a \u201clarge second epidemic wave once the measures were lifted,\u201d SAGE said.\n\nOn March 12 came a bombshell for the British public. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, announced Britain had moved the threat to UK citizens from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201chigh.\u201d And he said the country had moved from trying to contain the disease to trying to slow its spread. New cases were not going to be tracked at all. \u201cIt is no longer necessary for us to identify every case,\u201d he said. Only hospital cases would, in future, be tested for the virus. What had been an undisclosed policy was in the open: beyond a certain point, attempts to completely extinguish the virus would stop.\n\nThe same day, putting aside his jokey self, Johnson made a speech in Downing Street, flanked by two Union Jacks and evoking the spirit of Winston Churchill\u2019s \u201cdarkest hour\u201d address. He warned: \u201cI must level with you, level with the British public - more families, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d\n\nFor most Britons, it came as a shock. Several of the next day\u2019s newspapers splashed Johnson\u2019s words on their front pages.\n\nVallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who chaired SAGE, said in a BBC interview on March 13 that the plan was to simply control the pace of infection. The government had, for now, rejected what he called \u201ceye-catching measures\u201d like stopping mass gatherings such as football games or closing schools. The \u201caim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely.\u201d Most people would get the virus mildly, and this would build up \u201cherd immunity\u201d which, in time, would stop the disease\u2019s progress.\n\nBut by now, the country was rebelling. Major institutions decided to close. After players began to get infected, the professional football leagues suspended their games. As Johnson still refused to close schools and ban mass gatherings, the Daily Mirror\u2019s banner headline, summing up a widespread feeling, asked on March 13: \u201cIs It Enough?\u201d\n\nThe catalyst for a policy reversal came on March 16 with the publication of a report by Neil Ferguson\u2019s Imperial College team. It predicted that, unconstrained, the virus could kill 510,000 people. Even the government\u2019s \u201cmitigation\u201d approach could lead to 250,000 deaths and intensive care units being overwhelmed at least eight times over.\n\nImperial\u2019s prediction of over half a million deaths was no different from the report by the government\u2019s own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier. Yet it helped trigger a policy turn-around, both in London and in Washington, culminating seven days later in Johnson announcing a full lockdown of Britain. The report also jarred the U.S. administration into tougher measures to slow the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nFerguson was now in isolation himself after catching the virus. Testifying by video link to a committee in Parliament, he explained why he and other scientific advisers had shifted from advocating partial social-distancing measures to warning that without a rigorous shutdown, the NHS would be overwhelmed. The reason, he said, lay in data coming out of Italy that showed large numbers of patients required critical care.\n\n\u201cThe revision was that, basically, estimates of the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, which is only done in a critical care unit, roughly doubled,\u201d he said.\n\nEdmunds had a different explanation for the policy shift.\n\nWhat allowed Britain to alter course, said Edmunds, was a lockdown in Italy that \u201copened up the policy space\u201d coupled with new data. First came a paper by Edmunds\u2019 own London School team that examined intermittent lockdowns, sent to the modelling committee on March 11 and validated by Edinburgh University. Ferguson\u2019s revised Imperial research followed.\n\nWoolhouse, the Edinburgh professor, confirmed the sequence.\n\nEdmunds said these new studies together had demonstrated that if the British government imposed a lengthy period of tougher measures, perhaps relaxed periodically, then the size of the epidemic could be substantially reduced.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nStill, without a vaccine or effective treatments, it\u2019s going to be hard to avoid a substantial part of the British population getting infected, said Edmunds. \u201cUntil you get to a vaccine, there is no way of getting out of this without certainly tens of thousands of deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd probably more than that.\u201d\n\nNow subject to intense public scrutiny, the modelling teams at universities across Britain continue to work on different scenarios for how the world can escape the virus\u2019s clutches. According to Medley, the chairman of the SPI-M pandemic modelling committee, no one now doubts, for all the initial reservations, that a lockdown was essential in Britain.\n\nMedley added: \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in six months. All we know is that unless we stop transmission now, the health service will collapse. Yep, that\u2019s the only thing we know for sure.\u201d",
