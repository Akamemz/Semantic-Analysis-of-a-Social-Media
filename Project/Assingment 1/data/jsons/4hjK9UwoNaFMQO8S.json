The Social Security Disability Insurance trust fund could run out of money in as soon as two years , government officials say .\n`` We should fulfill our promises to the men and women who serve , but we need to streamline these duplicative programs , '' said Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , who requested the study .\nVeterans groups disagree . They say the retirement money was earned for years of service in the military , while disability payments are compensation for service-related injuries and wounds .\nIn most cases , veterans who receive a combination of benefits are severely disabled . About 4 in 5 veterans who got triple payments had a disability rating of at least 50 percent , the GAO said . Nearly half of those receiving triple payments were at least 60 percent .\nLouis Celli Jr. , a Washington representative for the American Legion , said critics of the multiple benefits are `` misguided and uninformed . '' He said the report `` should simply be filed in the category of one of Sen. Coburn 's parting shots to loyal upstanding American patriots who have sacrificed so much for this country . ''\nCoburn , a longtime critic of government spending , is retiring at the end of the year . He said in an interview that the report raises legitimate questions about whether disability benefits are getting to those who truly need them .\n`` This is billions of dollars a year in duplicative payments , '' Coburn said . `` We ought to reassess and say , 'Are we doing more than take care of people in need ? ' I 'm not against the military . I do n't think they should be triple dipping . ''\nMost Americans would find it hard to understand how someone making $ 86,000 a year in tax-exempt VA income qualifies for Social Security Disability Insurance , when civilian workers are disqualified from the program if they make as little as $ 13,000 a year , Coburn said .\nOnly 17 percent of those who received multiple forms of compensation had suffered a combat-related disability , according to the GAO .\nVeterans have long been exempted from rules that deny Social Security benefits to anyone with other income exceeding $ 13,000 a year .\nBut until the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , veterans were barred from receiving both military retirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs ' disability benefits . Under a Civil War-era statute , the Pentagon docked retirement pay dollar-for-dollar up to the amount of disability benefits from the VA .\nWith bipartisan support , Congress changed that law in 2002 , gradually restoring military retirement pay to veterans also drawing disability benefits from the VA .\n`` Our nation 's status as the world 's only superpower is largely due to the sacrifices our veterans made in the last century , '' Sen. Harry Reid , D-Nev. , said in March 2002 when the bill was being debated .\n`` Rather than honoring their commitment and bravery by fulfilling our obligations , the federal government has chosen to perpetuate this longstanding injustice , '' Reid said . `` Quite simply , this is disgraceful and we must correct it . ''\nAt the time , then-Sen. John Warner , R-Va. , a former Navy secretary , posed a question to fellow senators : `` How can we ask the men and women who have so faithfully served to sacrifice a portion of their retirement because they are also receiving compensation for an injury suffered while serving their country ? ''\nWarner acknowledged that the change would have `` significant cost , '' but added ; `` Is the cost too high ? I think not . ''\nAbout 3 percent of the nation 's 1.9 million military retirees collect all three benefits , the GAO said .\nThe report did not recommend changes to the program .
