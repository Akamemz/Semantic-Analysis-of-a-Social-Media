    "content": "Residents of Santa Clara County , California , voted yesterday to recall Aaron Persky , the superior court judge widely criticized for sentencing Stanford student Brock Turner to just six months in prison .\nTurner was convicted in 2016 of sexually assaulting an incapacitated woman . Prosecutors had sought a six-year sentence , but Persky thought Turner probably was n't a danger to others and was concerned a lengthier prison stint would adversely impact him .\nThis outraged Stanford law professor Michelle Dauber\u2014whose daughter is friends with Turner 's victim\u2014and so Dauber launched a now-successful campaign to have Persky recalled from office . The point of the recall was to hold `` white , privileged men accountable , '' Dauber told The New York Times .\nThe prison component of Turner 's sentence was indeed lenient . But a simple fact has often been absent from this conversation : The six-month sentence was n't Persky 's idea , but rather the recommendation of the probation department . And even if Turner should have spent more time behind bars , he is still registered as a sex offender and likely will be for the rest of his life . He will have trouble finding a place to live , holding a job , and interacting with young people . Sex offenders are treated as pariahs and must obey onerous restrictions , even in cases where they pose almost no risk to others .\nBut even people who ca n't muster any sympathy for Turner should still be concerned about what message Persky 's recall will send .
