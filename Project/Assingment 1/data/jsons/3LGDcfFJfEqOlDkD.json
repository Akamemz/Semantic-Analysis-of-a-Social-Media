Bernard Sanders outperformed expectations and reset the Democratic presidential primary , putting a serious dent in Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s aura of inevitability .\nMrs. Clinton held a slim lead of 49.8 percent of delegates awarded to Mr. Sanders \u2018 49.6 percent , with 100 percent of Iowa precincts reporting .\n\u201c The results tonight are the closest in Iowa Democratic caucus history .

Barack Obama , and went on to lose the nomination to him in a race that lasted through June .\nShe followed her 2008 loss here with a come-from-behind victory in New Hampshire , but that will be tougher to duplicate this year , with Mr. Sanders , who has represented neighboring Vermont in Washington for decades , holding a commanding lead in polling there .\nSEE ALSO : Bernie Sanders says Iowa gives campaign a kick-start\nIowa awards its delegates proportionally at the precinct level , and the state party does not actually report vote totals for each candidate .\nSpeaking at her campaign headquarters in Des Moines , Mrs. Clinton said she was \u201c breathing a big sigh of relief , \u201d a hint at the crushing defeat she suffered here eight years ago . She also said she \u2019 s now looking forward to a one-on-one debate with Mr. Sanders .\n\u201c It is rare that we have the opportunity that we do now to have a real contest of ideas , to really think hard about what the Democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it , \u201d she said . \u201c I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough , that standing still is not an option , and that brings people together to find ways that will improve the lives of Americans . \u201d\nHillary for America \u2019 s Iowa State Director Matt Paul said in a Tuesday morning statement : \u201c Hillary Clinton has won the Iowa Caucus . After thorough reporting \u2014 and analysis \u2014 of results , there is no uncertainty and Secretary Clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegates . Statistically , there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton \u2019 s advantage . \u201d\nCalling the race a \u201c virtual tie , \u201d Mr. Sanders said he succeeded by battling the juggernaut Clinton campaign to a razor-thin finish in Iowa and hit the anti-establishment notes that have made him the darling of liberals .\n\u201c Nine months ago , we came to this beautiful state . We had no political organization , we had no money , we had no name recognition , and we were taking on the most powerful organization in the United States of America , \u201d he said in a speech at his campaign headquarters , delivered just after Mrs. Clinton left the stage .\n\u201c I think the people have sent a very profound message to the political establishment , and to the economic establishment , and by the way , to the media establishment , \u201d he continued . \u201c That is , given the enormous crises facing our country , it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton has clung to President Obama during this campaign on a host of issues from foreign policy to health care to gun control . Many Iowa Democrats approved of that strategy and said they weren \u2019 t ready for the lurch even further to the left that Mr. Sanders would represent .\nSome seemed to buy into Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s claim that Mr. Sanders \u2018 policy proposals \u2014 especially his $ 1.38 trillion-per-year universal health care plan \u2014 would result in tax increases on the middle class .\n\u201c I just like her , and I don \u2019 t like Bernie Sanders . He \u2019 s going to raise taxes \u2014 he \u2019 s said so , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to raise taxes \u2019 \u2014 and who \u2019 s going to pay for it ? We are , \u201d said Mike Regan , caucusing in Council Bluffs , on the western side of the state . \u201c Unless he can get Trump to pay for it . \u201d\nEntrance polls found Mrs. Clinton with a slight lead over Mr. Sanders among female voters , 53 percent to 43 percent , with Mr. Sanders winning among male voters by the exact same margin , according to entrance polls from The Wall Street Journal .\nPolling also gave Mrs. Clinton the edge among older voters . She won 68 percent of voters over 65 , compared to 26 percent for Mr. Sanders . By contrast , Mr. Sanders dominated among younger voters , capturing 84 percent of voters ages 17 to 29 , compared to just 13 percent for the former secretary of state .\nNearly three in five Democrats said they wanted to continue Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies , and Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly won those voters . Those who wanted a more liberal direction , meanwhile , went to Mr. Sanders .\nFred Turnbaugh , wearing a Navy ball cap and a \u201c Give \u2018 em Hell , Bernie \u201d lapel pin on his jeans jacket while caucusing at Franklin Elementary School in Council Bluffs , said he appreciated the Vermont senator \u2019 s allegiance to blue-collar workers .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve always liked the way he \u2019 s pro-worker and takes care of the middle class , \u201d Mr. Turnbaugh said .\nHis wife Diana Turnbaugh also swung for Mr. Sanders , but said she would also support Mrs. Clinton if she wins the nomination .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s a big landslide , I don \u2019 t have a problem with her either , \u201d Ms. Turnbaugh said .\nShe said she \u2019 s looking for Mr. Sanders to improve Medicare . \u201c I \u2019 m on Medicare , and the Obamacare insurance just ruined me . \u201d\nOther caucusgoers said they appreciated Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s position on social issues such as same-sex marriage .\nAlisha Delsignore called the former secretary of state \u201c very solid . \u201d\n\u201c I have gay parents , so I like her position on those issues , \u201d said Ms. Delsignore . \u201c Plus she \u2019 s a woman . \u201d\nHer husband Nick Delsignore also backed Mrs. Clinton , in part because he worried about what he described as Mr. Sanders \u2018 lack of experience .\n\u201c Some of his positions just aren \u2019 t as laid out , \u201d said Mr. Delsignore , who wore a Sanders T-shirt .\nWhile some voters have misgivings about Mr. Sanders , his performance thus far has been impressive , and he \u2019 s survived while other Democratic candidates have fallen by the wayside .\nThe Democratic field started with five candidates , but former Virginia Sen.
