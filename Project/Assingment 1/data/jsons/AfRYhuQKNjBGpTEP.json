    "content": "Ben Carson topped the rest of the Republican presidential field in fundraising for the third quarter , with Jeb Bush placing second \u2014 a critical showing for the former Florida governor whose White House bid has faltered in recent weeks .\nAlthough billionaire front-runner Donald Trump is self-financing his campaign and does not actively seek donations , the real estate tycoon took in more cash unsolicited than did some of his rivals who need donations to keep their campaigns running .\n( Corrected paragraph : ) Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , meanwhile , reported the most cash on hand .\nMr. Carson , a retired neurosurgeon , said he raised $ 20.7 million from July 1 through Sept. 30 , followed by Mr. Bush \u2019 s $ 13.4 million and Sen. Mr. Cruz \u2019 s $ 12.2 million haul , according to records filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission .\nBusinesswoman Carly Fiorina raised about $ 7 million , Mr. Rubio raised $ 6 million , Ohio Gov . John Kasich collected $ 4.4 million and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie brought in $ 4.2 million . Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky reported a $ 2.5 million haul as he fights to be included on the next debate \u2019 s main stage amid declining poll numbers .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in it for the long haul , \u201d Mr. Paul insisted in an interview on CNN . \u201c We have planned and we have organized in all 50 states . I wouldn \u2019 t waste two years of my life trying to put this message out if I did not plan on being there when they voted , so we plan on being there when they vote . \u201d\nHis $ 2.5 million was a major drop from the $ 7 million he raised in the second quarter , which ran from April 1 to June 30 , but Mr. Paul said he has seen a surge in October and is comfortable with the $ 2 million in cash he had on hand .\nBut that $ 2.5 million take is less than what Mr. Trump raised with neither effort nor need .\nThe Trump campaign raised $ 3.9 million in the third quarter , not only more than Mr. Paul but also almost as much as Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich . Mr. Trump received 73,942 unsolicited donations with an average contribution of $ 50.46 .\nBut the Trump campaign also spent $ 4 million from July 1 through Sept. 30 , a higher figure than some of his peers , albeit much less than Mr. Carson . For example , Mr. Kasich spent $ 1.7 million in the quarter , Mrs. Fiorina spent $ 2.2 million and Mr. Christie said he spent $ 2.8 million \u2014 all less than Mr. Trump .\nMr. Trump made a contribution of $ 100,779 to his campaign during the quarter , raising the amount he has personally spent since launching his campaign to $ 1,909,576 .\nBut for the others , the third-quarter report is a key midpoint test as donors and activists try to gauge who has the funding to stick it out .\n\u201c We knew from the start this was going to be a hard fought and close race , but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be , \u201d Mr. Bush \u2019 s campaign manager , Danny Diaz , wrote in a letter to donors .\n\u201c I \u2014 for one \u2014 would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican Primary , \u201d he wrote .\nMr. Diaz assured donors that Mr. Bush would be \u201c better funded than any other in the entire field \u201d and that their campaign has a \u201c formidable grassroots organization in the early states . \u201d\nAlthough his fundraising intake was respectable , Mr. Bush ended with $ 10.3 million in cash on hand , which lagged several of his competitors : Sen. Ted Cruz , with $ 13.5 million ; Mr. Carson , with $ 11.3 million ; and Mr. Rubio , with $ 11 million .\nMr. Rubio , who draws from the same Florida base of donors as Mr. Bush , was quick to highlight the difference .\n\u201c Thanks to smart budgeting and fiscal discipline , Marco Rubio for president started October with more money in the bank than Jeb Bush for president and most other campaigns , \u201d according to a statement by Mr. Rubio \u2019 s campaign \u2014 put out six minutes after Mr. Bush \u2019 s announcement . \u201c Rubio \u2019 s FEC report details the lengths his campaign went to save money . \u201d\nIt goes on to list buying office furniture from Craigslist , taking cheap Uber rides and flying discount airliners such as Sprint and Frontier .\nMr. Bush has been criticized for running a costly campaign , complete with chartered flights and expensive hotels .\nSurprisingly , one of the most frugal campaigns is associated with a name synonymous with opulence and high-class trimmings : Donald Trump .\nAccording to the FEC filing , the Trump campaign showed frugality in his expenses , with roughly $ 320 spent for McDonald \u2019 s from Iowa to New Hampshire to Virginia . Staffers also frequented Wendy \u2019 s and Dairy Queen .\nTheir overnight stays were at the Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott .\nBy contrast , while Mr. Carson raised the largest amount , his campaign also burned through $ 14 million in the third quarter , spending money on lavish dinners at Johnny \u2019 s Half Shell , an upscale Washington seafood restaurant , and stays at the swanky Waldorf Hotel in New York .\n\u201c It is my great honor to be participating in this Presidential race , which has the possibility of having a truly great and positive impact on America , \u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement releasing his numbers . \u201c While our original budget was substantially higher than the amount spent , good business practices and even better ideas and policy have made it unnecessary to have spent a larger sum .\n\u201c To be number one in every poll , both state and national , and to have spent the least amount of dollars of any serious candidate is a testament to what I can do for America .
