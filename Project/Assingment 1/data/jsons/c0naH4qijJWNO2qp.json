    "content": "God is Ben Carson \u2019 s favorite subject . Brain surgery is a close second . Housing is somewhere further down the list .\n\u201c I was told that as a government leader , I really should n't talk about God . But I have to tell you , it 's part of who I am , \u201d Carson said last month , in one of his first speeches as Housing and Urban Development secretary .\nLess than two months into the job , Carson still holds forth on God and neurosurgery , but his views on housing policy remain largely a mystery . While he 's making good on a promised listening tour to learn about the $ 48 billion agency he now leads , he 's done little public speaking about the urgent issue at hand \u2014 a lack of affordable housing .\nThat 's one reason why early excitement over his nomination has given way to bewilderment and now frustration . Every policy job at the agency remains vacant , and advocates who thought Carson \u2019 s celebrity would raise awareness of affordable housing have been disappointed . President Donald Trump doused any remaining hope when he said he would slash HUD funding by 13.2 percent .\nCarson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that policy proposals are in the works , but in public appearances the one-time presidential candidate is sticking to his stump-speech staples . He prescribes \u201c godly principles \u201d as a cure for the country \u2019 s political division and praises housing advocates for \u201c putting God \u2019 s love into action . \u201d\n\u201c Speaking of God , which I love to do ; quite frankly , he \u2019 s a great guy , \u201d Carson said on March 28 , drawing friendly laughter during a speech to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals . \u201c We should be grateful that God gave us variety . But you know what he didn \u2018 t give us variety in ? The brain . \u201d\nWith that , the secretary \u2014 an acclaimed pediatric neurosurgeon \u2014 was off and running to his other favorite subject . Housing experts brought on stage to analyze his remarks were flummoxed .\n\u201c I was trying to take notes on what he was saying about housing , \u201d said Armando Falcon , chief executive at Falcon Capital Advisors , waving a piece of blank paper . \u201c I could have filled a page with neurosurgery notes .

There \u2019 s a mistaken thinking that we \u2019 re not supposed to talk about God , \u201d Carson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Godly principles and loving your fellow man and caring about your neighbor , there \u2019 s nothing wrong with that . \u201d\nBut lately , his up-by-the-bootstraps message has been falling flat with anti-poverty audiences .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a great story , but it \u2019 s a dangerous message because not everybody can pull themselves up by their bootstraps , \u201d said Maria Foscarinis , executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty . \u201c Nobody does that , including Secretary Carson . He had a lot of support \u2014 his mother , his family , his faith . He had a whole context of support . \u201d\nSo when the secretary got stuck in an elevator while touring a Miami housing project on April 12 , Twitter was ruthless and late-night TV had its fun .

Show me the language and the votes . \u201d\nCarson said that while housing will be part of Trump \u2019 s infrastructure bill , that legislation won \u2019 t fill funding gaps at HUD . To meet the president \u2019 s spending targets , the agency will find ways to cut waste and be more efficient , he said .\nAs he learns his way around the HUD bureaucracy , Carson expects to start announcing policy plans in the next 90 days .
