( AP Photo/Susan Walsh )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 President Donald Trump unveiled his long-awaited Mideast peace plan Tuesday alongside a beaming Benjamin Netanyahu , presenting a vision that matched the Israeli leader \u2019 s hard-line , nationalist views while falling far short of Palestinian ambitions .\nTrump \u2019 s plan envisions a disjointed Palestinian state that turns over key parts of the West Bank to Israel . It sides with Israel on key contentious issues that have bedeviled past peace efforts , including borders and the status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements , and attaches nearly impossible conditions for granting the Palestinians their hoped-for state .\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the plan as \u201c nonsense \u201d and vowed to resist it . Netanyahu called it a \u201c historic breakthrough \u201d equal in significance to the country \u2019 s declaration of independence in 1948 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a great plan for Israel . It \u2019 s a great plan for peace , \u201d he said .\nHe vowed to immediately press forward with his plans to annex the strategic Jordan Valley and all the Israeli settlements in occupied lands . Netanyahu said he \u2019 d ask his Cabinet to approve the annexation plans in their next meeting on Sunday , an explosive move that could trigger harsh international reaction and renewed violence with the Palestinians .\n\u201c This dictates once and for all the eastern border of Israel , \u201d Netanyahu told Israeli reporters later . \u201c Israel is getting an immediate American recognition of Israeli sovereignty on all the settlements , without exceptions . \u201d\nGiven the Palestinian opposition , the plan seems unlikely to lead to any significant breakthrough . But it could give a powerful boost to both Trump and Netanyahu who are both facing legal problems ahead of tough elections .\nTrump called his plan a \u201c win-win \u201d for both Israel and the Palestinians , and urged the Palestinians not to miss their opportunity for independence . But Abbas , who accuses the U.S. of unfair bias toward Israel , rejected it out of hand .\n\u201c We say 1,000 no \u2019 s to the Deal of the Century , \u201d Abbas said , using a nickname for Trump \u2019 s proposal .\n\u201c We will not kneel and we will not surrender , \u201d he said , adding that the Palestinians would resist the plan through \u201c peaceful , popular means . \u201d\nThe plan comes amid Trump \u2019 s impeachment trial and on a U.S. election year , and after Netanyahu was indicted on counts of fraud , breach of trust and bribery in three separate cases . The longtime Israeli leader , who denies any wrongdoing , also faces a March 2 parliamentary election , Israel \u2019 s third in less than a year . He hopes to use the plan , and his close ties with Trump , to divert attention from his legal troubles .\nThe Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for an independent state and the removal of many of the more than 700,000 Israeli settlers from these areas .\nBut as details emerged , it became clear that the plan sides heavily with Netanyahu \u2019 s hard-line nationalist vision for the region and shunts aside many of the Palestinians \u2019 core demands .\nUnder the terms of the \u201c peace vision \u201d that Trump \u2019 s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been working on for nearly three years , all settlers would remain in place , and Israel would retain sovereignty over all of its settlements as well as the strategic Jordan Valley .\n\u201c The Israeli military will continue to control the entire territory , \u201d Netanyahu said . \u201c No one will be uprooted from their home . \u201d\nThe proposed Palestinian state would also include more than a dozen Israeli \u201c enclaves \u201d with the entity \u2019 s borders monitored by Israel . It would be demilitarized and give Israel overall security control . In addition , the areas of east Jerusalem offered to the Palestinians consist of poor , crowded neighborhoods located behind a hulking concrete separation barrier .\nTrump acknowledged that he has done a lot for Israel , but he said he wanted the deal to be a \u201c great deal for the Palestinians . \u201d\nThe plan would give the Palestinians limited control over an estimated 70 % of the West Bank , nearly double the amount where they currently have limited self-rule . Trump said it would give them time needed to meet the challenges of statehood .\nThe only concession the plan appears to demand of Israel is a four-year freeze on the establishment of new Israeli settlements in certain areas of the West Bank . But Netanyahu clarified later that this only applied to areas where there are no settlements and Israel has no immediate plans to annex , and that he considered the plan to impose no limitations on construction .\nThousands of Palestinians protested in Gaza City ahead of the announcement , burning pictures of Trump and Netanyahu and raising a banner reading \u201c Palestine is not for sale . \u201d\nTrump said he sent a letter to Abbas to tell him that the territory that the plan has set aside for a new Palestinian state will remain open and undeveloped for four years .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to work , \u201d Trump said , as he presented the plan at a White House ceremony filled with Israeli officials and allies , including evangelical Christian leaders and wealthy Republican donors . Representatives from the Arab countries of Bahrain , Oman and the United Arab Emirates were present , but there were no Palestinian representatives .\n\u201c President Abbas , I want you to know , that if you chose the path to peace , America and many other countries ... we will be there to help you in so many different ways , \u201d he said . \u201c And we will be there every step of the way . \u201d\nThe 50-page plan builds on a 30-page economic plan for the West Bank and Gaza that was unveiled last June and which the Palestinians have also rejected .\nIt envisions a future Palestinian state consisting of the West Bank and Gaza , connected by a combination of roads and tunnels .

President , because of this historic recognition and because I believe your peace plan strikes the right balance where other plans have failed , \u201d Netanyahu said . \u201c I \u2019 ve agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan .\nThe Jordan Valley annexation is a big part of Netanyahu \u2019 s strategy and a key promise meant to appeal to his hard-line nationalist base , which mostly applauded the Trump plan .\nU.S. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the plan \u2019 s release , said they expected negative responses from the Palestinians , but were hopeful that Jordan and Egypt , the only two Arab nations to have peace treaties with Israel , would not reject it outright .\nJordan gave the plan a cool reaction , saying it remained committed to a two-state solution based on Israel \u2019 s pre-1967 lines .
