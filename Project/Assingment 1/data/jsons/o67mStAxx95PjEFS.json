    "content": "An inexpensive coronavirus test that millions of Americans could use at a pharmacy , in a workplace or even at home could prove to be a vital asset in allowing people to return to jobs and school . Last week Deborah Birx , the White House \u2019 s coronavirus-response coordinator , called rapid antigen tests the \u201c breakthrough innovation \u201d that is needed to perform hundreds of millions of such assays a day . The remarks echoed her previous statements that antigen tests might be used to examine broad swaths of the public .\nThe technique often involves a technology\u2014called a lateral flow assay\u2014similar to that employed in home pregnancy tests . In the test , an antibody can bind to one of the spike proteins ( the antigens ) that cover the surface of the virus like the spines on a puffer fish . The tests are inexpensive to produce and simple to use , and they deliver results in minutes .\nThe goal is also to field a test that is just as accurate as the current standard , which uses polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to process the virus \u2019 s genetic material and amplify it for detection . But major technical hurdles still remain . \u201c What you would want in terms of a breakthrough is that [ an antigen ] test is more sensitive , [ or less prone to false negatives ] , and easier to use than a PCR-based test . And that is not so easy to do , \u201d says Bettina Fries , chief of the infectious diseases division at Stony Brook Medicine . \u201c Normally , PCR-based tests are more sensitive . \u201d\nThe urgent need to conduct massive levels of testing means that any feasible technology is being considered . OraSure Technologies , a medical device company in Bethlehem , Pa. , received a $ 710,310 federal contract last month for an in-home assay that can potentially detect a coronavirus antigen in saliva in as little as 20 minutes . Stephen Tang , the company \u2019 s CEO , says such antigen tests are needed to screen millions of people per day . \u201c You can \u2019 t be dependent on the throughput of laboratories and the availability of medical and laboratory professionals , \u201d as PCR assays typically require , to conduct widespread testing , he says .\nBecause a PCR test makes thousands of copies of its target RNA , it is able to detect a virus at far lower concentrations , called the limit of detection , than antigen tests typically can . PCR \u2019 s limits of detection \u201c are on the order of a few hundred virus particles in a milliliter of transport liquid , \u201d says Geoffrey Baird , acting chair of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington \u2019 s School of Medicine .\nIn contrast , the sensitivities of rapid antigen tests have been mixed . A 2016 analysis of 116 such tests for the bacteria that cause strep throat , for example , found they had a sensitivity of 86 percent on average\u2014turning in false negative results for 14 percent of people with strep . Antigen tests used to diagnose viral infections such as the flu are even less sensitive , often reporting a negative result when the virus is actually present . Their specificity , or ability to correctly avoid false positive results , is often much higher . They can exceed 95 percent , meaning less than 5 percent of people without infection would test positive .\nBirx had said that antigen tests could be used as first-pass screening tools that would be confirmed with follow-up PCR assays . Otto Yang , an infectious disease researcher at the University of California , Los Angeles , is uncertain if that goal can be achieved . \u201c Generally , when you \u2019 re doing it that way , you aim for higher sensitivity and less specificity in your screening test , \u201d he says . \u201c It only makes sense if you \u2019 re trying to save money or reagents , and you don \u2019 t have the capacity [ to do PCR ] . The only potential benefit would be cost savings , but the loss of sensitivity is a big problem. \u201d The approach would make sense , Yang adds , only if the first-pass screening test was at least as sensitive as PCR in addition to being cheaper .\nHis view will by no means close the debate on the validity of antigen testing .

If the testing is repeated , I believe the rapid [ antigen ] test will pick [ the virus ] up . \u201d\nGehrke acknowledges that infected individuals can have viral proteins present at levels below the test \u2019 s limit of detection in the first few days of infection . He says those levels will increase as the infection progresses , however . \u201c It \u2019 s possible that at the very left end of that bell curve , there \u2019 s a time that PCR can detect [ the virus ] but the rapid antigen test doesn \u2019 t , \u201d Gehrke says .
