    "content": "Sometimes it seems like politics is an endless battle for the ownership of stories . Who owns the story of health care in this country ? Who owns the story of closing abortion clinics ? Who owns the story of self-defense ? Who owns the story of marriage ?\nI moved to Texas at the end of July , trying to take ownership of my life . One of the things I have struggled with is the idea that academia now has control over me , that my degree requirements , my professors , my program will dictate my future . But what has really bothered me are some of the ways ownership has been talked about in class . I have realized that I was under the false impression that when one reached a certain level of education , the racism and sexism would end .\nRecently , one of my classes got to talking about race and discourse ( what language has to do with power ) , and one student raised a hand and said he had an example that would help . Then he described how , when he was a boy , he could n't figure out what a certain newscaster \u2019 s name was . The student complained that because the newscaster pronounced his name with a \u201c Mexican \u201d accent , he couldn \u2019 t understand it . He gave this as an example of \u201c code-switching , \u201d as an example of how this \u201c code-switch \u201d took away the newscaster 's power . ( I will get to code-switching , a term that I think was confused in this class . ) The student claimed that the newscaster 's pronunciation of his name stopped him from reaching his audience . Then the student said what has been bothering me relentlessly since then , that this\u2014the newscaster 's name as he himself owned it\u2014 \u201d wasn \u2019 t his real name . \u201d\nI didn \u2019 t know how to respond . I knew how I would have questioned this conversation as a teacher , how I would have shut it down before ownership of someone 's name was denied and then talked about the importance and implications of such a conversation , but I was not the instructor . I did not hold power in that classroom . What I did , which I hope was the right thing to do , was to say that \u201c on the record \u201d \u2014I made a point of this\u2014what this student had said made me extremely uncomfortable . I hoped that the instructor would take it from there , but he did not .\nI have been repeating this story to everyone I know , or everyone I know who doesn \u2019 t share this other student \u2019 s opinion\u2014which , in truth , is everyone I know well enough to tell . And I have tried to own the story , too . I have tried to make it slightly different than it was , a story where we would all be outraged , where we would all have time to process and examine what happened . But in the classroom , this comment went otherwise unchallenged , and I left the class feeling completely undone , and blaming , no doubt unfairly , the entire state of Texas .\nIt gives me the shivers , the idea that we do not own our names , that they belong to the ( white ) majority . And the way this student gave the example , like this would clear things up , like this was something everyone could agree on .\nI am in Texas . Right now , Wendy Davis is running for governor . Wendy Davis whom I watched on YouTube ( because no major news network covered it live ) filibuster an anti-abortion law in the State Senate . Whose pink sneakers became a cultural icon . Who soon announced her candidacy for governor and her intent to write a memoir . She is taking control of her story , building on her new fame . ( Not a complaint . I hear that desire and wish I were in the position to do the same . ) What I want to talk about is a recent campaign stop where Davis claimed she was \u201c pro-life , \u201d which she described as follows :\nI care about the life of every child : every child that goes to bed hungry , every child that goes to bed without a proper education , every child that goes to bed without being able to be a part of the Texas dream , every woman and man who worry about their children \u2019 s future and their ability to provide for that future . I care about life and I have a record of fighting for people above all else .\nTexas Republicans , by most accounts , are not happy about this use of the term \u201c pro-life. \u201d They do not like how Davis claimed the term , though many Republicans refer to pro-choice as \u201c pro-abortion. \u201d This is the kind of ownership that wins or loses an election , and Davis has to play this game because she is playing the game of running for governor . The Republicans would argue that it is not her term to use , or that it is not right for her to use the term in a way that does not mean \u201c anti-abortion. \u201d Davis is clearly not anti-abortion . Yet she is using the term as a way to talk about what she is for , that she is for life ; she is using the term as a way to define herself and to take ownership of her beliefs , rather than be labeled by someone else \u2019 s beliefs .\nThis is an issue of particular concern to me . I have , over the last couple of years , learned that many of the terms I have used to describe my experience have been called into question by people with similar experiences . For example , I have learned that many adoptees do not like to call the parents who give birth to us , \u201c birth parents. \u201d I have learned that some families call the day their adopted son/daughter arrived , \u201c Gotcha Day. \u201d I have been in shock over this term , too , for a long time : the idea that a word used to describe journalism that catches someone out is used to describe the day adoptees arrive , and in celebration ! I have been in shock over the ownership element , and whose day it is \u201c supposed \u201d to be . It has become clear that to the general public , adoption is \u201c owned \u201d by adoptive parents .\nWhose story is it , the story of the child who moves from one family to another , who leaves one life and has to start a new one ?\nAnd this brings me back to the issue of names . It is not uncommon that adult adoptees change their names to their original/birth names , or incorporate those names in some way . This can be seen as a rejection by adoptive parents . I have a friend whose parents refuse to call her by her legal name , i.e . not the name they gave her . Do they own her name ? For some adoptees , that may seem too close to the question , do they own her ? It must be remembered , of course , that adoption is a financial transaction as well as a familial one .\nFor some of us , ownership of a name , of a person , is something that can bring up some serious personal and historical trauma .\nI am currently the Fiction Editor at a magazine called The Good Men Project . I also teach for a program called Writers in the Schools , which matches writers to school systems . They look at our resumes or our faces or hear us talk or read our work and then they determine a \u201c placement. \u201d I have been matched to an all-boys Catholic school , fifth grade . Though I requested kindergarten to elementary , or in lieu of that , high school . Though I have a daughter and am far better suited to raising a daughter than I would be to raising a son . They saw what they wanted to see .\nIt reminds me of when I would listen to complaints from white Americans , when I was in Korea , about Koreans . Then I would hear complaints from Koreans , about Americans . But when I tried to defend Korea , the Americans would shut down , placing me as not American and thereby devaluing my opinions . And when I tried to defend America , the Koreans would shut down . Being on one side and then another only made me feel more clearly that I will always be in between . Maybe a common experience for adoptees who return to their birth lands .\nAt The Good Men Project , though I publish stories that do not prescribe what it is to be a ( good ) man , so many of the submissions I get ( from men ) do prescribe this . That , on its own , shows the power of a name . But what makes it worse is that many of these submissions put forward , either subtly or unsubtly , a perspective of male superiority , and implicitly , white man \u2019 s superiority . I get a lot of fiction where men own their stories but women do not . Some writers see the name of the magazine and see a safe place for the existing power structure . To some , `` The Good Men Project '' is a forum where men \u2019 s agency is on the table and therefore women \u2019 s agency is off the table .\nThe magazine has run into its own fair share of privilege problems , in fact , including publishing a string of essays on the subject of rape . Part of the problem in publishing these essays , even as a way into a conversation , is the privilege the male voice already has in defining and framing an act that is most often forced on women . The magazine did n't offer a perspective sensitive to that position , or anticipate clearly what it would mean for a venue called The Good Men Project to run an essay by an unapologetic rapist . It is bad enough that there are plenty of other places where men can say terrible things about women . Why here ? And what privilege it takes to think that this could start a conversation , not set it back . In founder and ex-contributor Tom Matlack 's most controversial essays , what he did n't get , somehow , was that he had a platform of male goodness and was using it to judge women .\nThis environment is not lost on one 's readers . I was recently on an email string where a reader accused The Good Men Project of \u201c shaming \u201d men , claiming good man status by saying he formed relationships on equality , and arguing that to suggest men should bear the brunt of equality was shaming . I wrote back that men bear more responsibility for establishing equality because of the power males have in our society , and that approaching relationships as if a gendered power structure doesn \u2019 t exist is to perpetuate that power structure . That argument , unfortunately , did n't get far . ( I should mention that the other editors did not share this reader 's , or Matlack 's , views . )\nThis is something I see all the time now , in this \u201c post-racist , \u201d \u201c post-sexist \u201d society : those with privilege trying to get out of responsibility for that privilege by claiming that we \u2019 re all equal now , or at least , `` I 'm a liberal/not racist/not sexist , so . '' Or those with privilege displaying what is commonly referred to , as I understand it , as white guilt , saying \u201c I \u2019 ll just never understand because I \u2019 m not like you \u201d ( read : why try ? ) , or , \u201c I don \u2019 t really have a better life \u201d ( do n't blame me ! ) , or \u201c Your culture is wonderful , I eat your food \u201d ( do n't blame me , I love kimchi ! ) .\nGod how I wish people would own their privilege . I am a man , and an American . Those things carry a certain power . I write this with a certain power . If I ignore the power I have , if I pretend not to have it , if I downplay it , or if I say someone with less power is \u201c special \u201d or \u201c valued \u201d ( read : exotic ) , I am perpetuating the power structure by trying to hide it from those who lose in it . If we ignore the power structures that are there , if we try to make them invisible , they don \u2019 t go away . We just validate them by putting the onus for them on the disempowered .\nIn the class I was in , where the other student said the newscaster \u2019 s name did not belong to him , I also got into an argument about code-switching . A second student was saying that code-switching was a way to make everyone feel empathy for each other , which was something I couldn \u2019 t get my head around .\nEmpathy is kind of a personal buzz word for me . I am all about empathy . And yet it was a failure of empathy that stopped me from understanding the empathy this student was referring to . I was looking at code-switching from the perspective of someone with less power switching to the code of the powerful . But he was looking at code-switching from the perspective of someone with power trying out the codes of the less powerful . That is , he thought of code-switching from a position of privilege . If a white American went to Japan and tried to \u201c act \u201d Japanese , he said , the American might learn something about a different culture . This is true . But what I think is most interesting here is the way this student was able to think about code-switching as an appreciation\u2014because he was talking as someone who already owned the majority code , he did n't have to think about \u201c coding up. \u201d He was talking about \u201c coding-down. \u201d ( Power structure-wise , not cultural value-wise . )\nWhen I figured out where he was coming from , that angle of privilege , I saw the point he was making . But he still wasn \u2019 t seeing from my point of view , that code-switching can be a way of making people feel like their own culture is less important , because they have to switch to a different culture to be understood , the way the first student was talking about the newscaster . We have to talk about code-switching our names now ! Or maybe this second student did understand and I 'm not giving him enough credit , again . But what I wanted from him was to own the fact that code-switching is far more often something done by the minority to fit into the majority society . What I wanted from him was to own the fact that it was a privilege for him to think about code-switching as a choice .\nI wanted ownership of that story , the story of race and discourse , as a minority student . I felt like that story was mine .",
