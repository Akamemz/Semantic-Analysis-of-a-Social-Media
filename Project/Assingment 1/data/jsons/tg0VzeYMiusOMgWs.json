    "content": "It is not a tribe . We can \u2019 t separate universal values from the West .\nA few months ago I spent a weekend at a rather ritzy and high-toned political confab . There were sessions on all the problems , including Russia and China , that confront \u201c the West. \u201d Most of the attendees were center-right and center-left , members of good standing in polite society . Much more presentable than I am . In a breakout session on relations between Western democracies and China , the participants kept saying that we should emphasize our values .\nNow , in the mouth of Trump , the words \u201c the West \u201d are taken as menacing . A code for white supremacy and racial conflict . And in some ways that \u2019 s understandable . Trump is a crude man , and if he embodies something Western , it is that civilization \u2019 s defects , its arrogance and avarice . People genuinely fear Trump , and naturally everything he says becomes an occasion for expressing new dimensions of that fear . If someone argues that Trump \u2019 s speech was fine but in his mouth comes across as blasphemy , I \u2019 d have trouble arguing with them . But that \u2019 s not the argument that most people are making .\nSome have said that the speech would have passed muster if it weren \u2019 t for the context of Poland itself . They blame Poland \u2019 s \u201c ultra-nationalism \u201d and \u201c retreat from democracy. \u201d These writers , usually entirely ignorant of Polish politics , can never quite describe the machinations of the ruling Law and Justice party on the state-run media or on the Constitutional Court . Nor could they describe with any specificity the state of those institutions in the hands of the previous ruling party , but all they need to know is that Poland opposes becoming a destination for Islamic migrants . Case closed . Never mind that all Eastern European governments , whether right-wing Hungary or left-wing Slovakia , oppose this migration . Their citizens see the results in Western Europe : social division , armed guards around monuments , and a decrease of liberty under rising surveillance . And they think , No thank you .\nSome point out , as evidence of Trump \u2019 s sinister intent , that he did not mention Polish failures or historic Polish crimes and complicity . I don \u2019 t know why people think U.S. presidents on a diplomatic tour in Poland should bring up the fact that some Poles collaborated with Nazis . We do not do this every time we go to France . Our presidents don \u2019 t even do this when we go to Germany . But for some reason , Poles deserve it . Even though in the history of Word War II , Poland saw one-fifth of its population die , a far larger share than can ever be said to have collaborated and pass on a generational guilt , which somehow exists only in Poland .\nBut others go further and say it was the terminology of \u201c the West \u201d that is problematic . Peter Beinart says that the West is necessarily a religious and racial definition , with its references to heritage , culture , and blood . He \u2019 s only half right . And I \u2019 ll come to that . Trump \u2019 s first speech as president also invoked blood . \u201c Whether we are black or brown or white , we all bleed the same red blood of patriots , we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms , \u201d he said . America is a country in which people of different races bleed the \u201c same blood . \u201d\nBut Beinart prefers a different vocabulary from \u201c Western. \u201d He praises earlier speeches in Poland by President George W. Bush , who merely said that America and Poland \u201c share a civilization \u201d and venerated membership in \u201c our transatlantic community. \u201d Beinart likes it because , as Bush said , \u201c Its values are universal. \u201d They are portable and can be given to anyone .\nWhen liberals and progressives talk about human rights , or universal values , they are talking about values that sprang out of the West , products of its history and culture .\nThis is a matter of hiding the ball . And deep down , liberal writers know it . When liberals and progressives talk about human rights , or universal values , they are talking about values that sprang out of the West , products of its history and culture . When they say that America should learn from other nations and even look to their systems of justice for wisdom , they do not point to Chinese law or to the jurisprudential schools of Cairo . They point to the courts of Western Europe . Our desire to see \u201c human rights \u201d and \u201c universal values \u201d spread throughout the world is quintessentially Western . And to the objects of our noble plans , it is often indistinguishable from the mission civilisatrice , or the colonial period , or the missionary and crusading efforts of Christendom . All these efforts were accompanied by military garrisons and the Western hope for new markets and fortunes . \u201c The West \u201d is no more a synecdoche for racial chauvinism than \u201c universal values \u201d is . The latter is just a layer of abstraction on top of it . A noble lie .\nTo hear paeans to an entire Western civilization as if they were merely tribal is bizarre . The squeamishness about ever using the first-person plural , \u201c we , \u201d is unbecoming and unserious . Worse , it \u2019 s also unneighborly . A \u201c we \u201d is inescapable if you want to live in a community . And to give people inside that community any sense of inclusion , it must necessarily follow that the community is in some ways exclusive . This is a truism of language , history , and sociology .\nThe civilization that Bush said Poles and Americans share is obviously far larger in scope than any tribalism . Here I borrow from Roger Scruton . The feeling of nationality itself , apart from times of war or political stress , is a form of peace and goodwill toward one \u2019 s neighbors , an emotional bond to the settlement that makes possible living together in a territory and sharing the protection of its laws with people very different from yourself . The West is a larger sphere of brotherhood between those nations \u2014 a brotherhood that has been lamentably fratricidal in its history , but also remarkably cooperative .\nThe increased anxiety so many people feel about the diversity of religious views and political priorities that have long been featured within Western societies \u2014 our ever-hotter culture wars \u2014 is a portentous sign that these bonds of nationality are weakening .
