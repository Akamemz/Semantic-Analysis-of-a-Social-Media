    "content": "Tillerson \u2019 s answer on Exxon \u2019 s dealings around the world was the most eye-opening\u2014particularly because Tillerson seemed completely unaware that he was throwing the entire run of what most people consider morality into the trash bin . But it was far from the only instance in which a moral question left him dangling .\nWhen it was pointed out to Tillerson that Exxon made deals with Vladimir Putin , he readily agreed . In back-to-back questioning from Marco Rubio and Bob Menendez , Tillerson was asked whether he considered Putin a war criminal . Tillerson not only would not use the term , he seemed baffled that anyone would . When Tillerson was given examples of Putin \u2019 s actions\u2014from using military weapons to attack and destroy civilian populations to bombing hospitals to murdering journalists and political opponents\u2014Tillerson was unmoved . He retreated first to the fallback that he didn \u2019 t have all the information . When it was pointed out that the information was from public sources , he was still unwilling to apply the term . Even Rubio seemed utterly shocked that he was unable to secure so much as an agreement that intentionally bombing a hospital was a war crime , and Tillerson \u2019 s repeated refusals to be budged left Rubio and Menendez agitated .\nTillerson , who put a deal on Putin \u2019 s desk worth half a trillion dollars , has billions of reasons to resist making that statement . That \u2019 s entirely within his definition of honor .\nThe exchange over Putin was also the moment for one of Tillerson \u2019 s most jaw-dropping admissions of ignorance . Though in his introduction he had mentioned Russia specifically and talked about Trump \u2019 s \u201c bold new approach \u201d to that nation , when confronted over the details , Tillerson claimed that he had actually not discussed Russia with Donald Trump . It was a statement so unexpected that it was asked it twice , and when Tillerson continued to plead ignorance , Menendez issued the summary of the day : \u201c Pretty amazing . \u201d\nA near repeat of the Russia conversation happened when Tillerson was asked about the actions of President Rodrigo Duterte and the thousands of people being killed in the name of \u201c drugs \u201d in the Philippines . Tillerson refused to condemn the actions . First he cited a lack of access to classified information . When told it was all in the newspaper , Tillerson refused to accept the press account ( as any good Trump staffer would ) . When told that Duterte himself was bragging over the number of bodies he was leaving in the streets , Tillerson still refused to condemn the actions . He claimed he couldn \u2019 t until he \u201c had the facts . \u201d\nOn other human rights issues such as women \u2019 s rights in Saudi Arabia , Tillerson pulled out his personal knowledge of events in \u201c the kingdom \u201d to say that it would be wrong to push them too fast . After all , that could endanger a deal .\nIt was during Menendez \u2019 s questioning that Tillerson made the most obvious eye-roller of the day , and the one that caused Sen. Bob Corker ( who gave up his questioning and introduction time to serve as Tillerson \u2019 s apologist-in-chief ) to sweat the most .\nAsked about Exxon \u2019 s lobbying efforts on Russian sanctions , Tillerson responded that he had not personally lobbied against sanctions and was unaware that Exxon had lobbied against sanctions . This despite the fact that Exxon filed 14 separate reports on their lobbying efforts , and despite the inconvenient truth that Rex Tillerson called Bob Corker personally to discuss sanctions .\nFor the rest of the day , Republicans trotted in explanatory notes and Corker did his best to find some nit that could be picked to explain the difference as lobbying about sanctions instead of against sanctions , but there was little doubt about the truth\u2014Tillerson lied openly and blatantly about the issue that \u2019 s most important to both Tillerson and Trump : the removal of sanctions against Russia .\nThis was just one example in which Rex Tillerson , 41-year Exxon employee and until days ago the CEO of that firm , pretended to have no knowledge of the company \u2019 s actions . Asked repeatedly about the company \u2019 s actions in routing business through Europe to get around sanctions and make sales to Iran , Syria , and the Sudan , Tillerson made one of many \u201c You \u2019 ll have to ask Exxon \u201d statements .\nIn an series of exchanges with Tim Kaine on climate change , Kaine not only showed that Exxon had decades of knowledge about climate change but that they stifled their own scientists . Tillerson first responded with \u201c I \u2019 m no longer with ExxonMobil so I \u2019 m in no position to speak on their behalf. \u201d Kaine kept pressing , but Tillerson would only reply \u201c The question would have to be put to ExxonMobil . \u201d\nWhen , in frustration , Tim Kaine finally said , \u201c Do you lack the knowledge or are you refusing to answer my question ? \u201d Tillerson \u2019 s reply was a snide , \u201c A little bit of both . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s Donald Trump \u2019 s secretary of state candidate , openly refusing to answer a question put to him in his confirmation hearing . It wasn \u2019 t just an admission of ignorance that would be worthy of the world \u2019 s worst CEO , it was a signal of open disrespect for the entire procedure .\nIn early discussion about climate change , Tillerson held to a series of nonsense statements about \u201c keeping a seat at the table \u201d that amounted to an unstated desire to destroy the Paris agreement and still pretend that the U.S. was taking \u201c leadership. \u201d Later Tillerson resorted to the same legalistic amorality he displayed on human rights . This was most clear when he refused to acknowledge any connection between a series of current events and climate change , saying that \u201c some literature \u201d said the connection wasn \u2019 t clear .\nSince Tillerson refused to answer the question about Exxon \u2019 s funding of climate denial material , you can guess where that literature originated .\nLate in the day , Chris Murphy brought Tillerson back to the discussion that had started with his refusal to condemn either Putin or Duterte . Murphy asked Tillerson to name any nation he would cite as a violator of human rights .
