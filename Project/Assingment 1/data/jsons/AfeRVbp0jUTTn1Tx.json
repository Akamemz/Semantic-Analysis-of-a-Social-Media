He currently stands at 39 percent approve , 53 percent disapprove \u2014 a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approve , 49 percent disapprove .\nAnd the movement has come from within key portions of his base . He is :\nDown significantly among suburban men , a net-positive approval rating of 51-to-39 percent to a net-negative of 42 percent approve , 48 percent disapprove . That 's a net change of down 18 percentage points .\nto a net-negative of 42 percent approve , 48 percent disapprove . That 's a net change of down 18 percentage points . Down a net of 13 points among white evangelicals , from 73-to-17 percent approve to 66-to-23 percent approve .\nDown a net of 10 points among Republicans , from 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent .\nfrom 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent . Down marginally among white men without a college degree , from 56-to-34 percent approve to 50-to-35 percent approve , a net change downward of 7 points .\n`` For the first time , we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking , '' said Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion , which conducted the poll . `` Do n't know if that 's temporary \u2014 tied to the government shutdown \u2014 or a broader problem the president is having . ''\nThe percentage of people now saying they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing is up to 45 percent , the highest for Trump since December 2017 .\nThe president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020 . Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020 , while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him .\nJust 76 percent of Trump supporters , 69 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him . Many , if not most , of them will likely vote for the president , but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability .\nFor context , in 2010 , when asked about then-President Barack Obama , just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him , while 48 percent said they would not . Obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote .\nBut for Trump to have more than half the country already saying it definitely wo n't vote for him indicates he is facing a difficult re-election .\n`` The president has had his base and not much else , '' Miringoff said , `` and when you look ahead to the election ... he enters with a significant disadvantage . His re-election prospects would definitely be in jeopardy at this point . ''\nTrump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the Electoral College in 2016 . He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote .

Just 12 percent have a negative view .\n`` If he gets in , he automatically becomes the front-runner with numbers like this , '' Miringoff said . `` He becomes the candidate who you have to get into the mix with and be competitive with him .
