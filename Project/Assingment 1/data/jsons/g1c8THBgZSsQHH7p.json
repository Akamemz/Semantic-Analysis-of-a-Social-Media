    "content": "The legislation , which would be the first major immigration overhaul since President Ronald Reagan backed amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986 , was drafted over the last several months by the so-called Gang of Eight , a bipartisan group of senators . It is largely in step with the president \u2019 s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers .\nBut no one expects the bill to pass the Senate without some modifications . Mr. Obama \u2019 s Republican allies on the issue \u2014 in particular Senators Marco Rubio of Florida , a member of the bipartisan group , and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma \u2014 warned last week that the president could lose their support without stronger efforts to secure the border , as well as other changes .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to get to where I can say yes , \u201d Mr. Coburn said as senators prepared to clear the way for what could be weeks of debate in the full chamber . \u201c But the only way you can say yes and sell it to the American people is to know that the border is secure , and this bill doesn \u2019 t do it . \u201d\nMr. Obama will try to set the tone for the legislative fight with a speech at the White House on Tuesday .
