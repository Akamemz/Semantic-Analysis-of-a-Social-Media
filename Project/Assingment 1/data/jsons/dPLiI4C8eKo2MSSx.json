Among the at\u00adtendees were Wash\u00ading\u00adton semi-celebrit\u00adies ( Joe Lieber\u00adman , Jon Hunts\u00adman , GOP strategist Mark McKin\u00adnon ) as well as an odd as\u00adsort\u00adment of D-list Hol\u00adly\u00adwood types ( Wayne Knight , who played New\u00adman on Sein\u00adfeld ; char\u00adac\u00adter act\u00ador Richard Kind ; Dean Nor\u00adris , the broth\u00ader-in-law from Break\u00ading Bad ; act\u00adress Rose McGow\u00adan ) . The din\u00adner served as the kick\u00adoff for the \u201c Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Con\u00adven\u00adtion , \u201d the brainchild of the Wash\u00ading\u00adton-based group No La\u00adbels . The goal of the gath\u00ader\u00ading was both straight\u00adfor\u00adward and ex\u00adtraordin\u00adar\u00adily am\u00adbi\u00adtious : to set in mo\u00adtion a plan that would re\u00adduce grid\u00adlock , po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion , and par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship in Wash\u00ading\u00adton . Yet even at this event , it wasn \u2019 t al\u00adways pos\u00adsible to keep par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship at bay . At one point dur\u00ading the Sunday night din\u00adner ( which cost No La\u00adbels $ 68 per plate ) , McGow\u00adan\u2014best known for her role on the early 2000s show Charmed\u2014In\u00ads\u00adtagrammed a video , taken from what ap\u00adpeared to be the angle of her lap . In it , she rolled her eyes and looked gen\u00ader\u00adally dis\u00adgus\u00adted . The cap\u00adtion read : \u201c Tell me all about it rich white male re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans. \u201d Minutes later , McGow\u00adan spoke to the group . \u201c What I see is a very , very white room , \u201d she scol\u00added . \u201c Which is shock\u00ading. \u201d She talked for at least a minute about how No La\u00adbels was well-in\u00adten\u00adtioned but had lost its way ( while also adding something about how she was a busi\u00adness\u00adwo\u00adman who owned homes in four coun\u00adtries ) be\u00adfore one of the group \u2019 s co-founders at\u00adtemp\u00adted to cut her off with a tim\u00adid , \u201c We ap\u00adpre\u00adci\u00adate your com\u00adments. \u201d Pump\u00ading a hand in the air , McGow\u00adan shouted , \u201c And I ap\u00adpre\u00adci\u00adate you ! \u201d Then she dis\u00adap\u00adpeared in\u00adto the Manchester night .\nThe un\u00adwel\u00adcome specters of par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship and di\u00advis\u00adive\u00adness again hovered the next morn\u00ading , when Don\u00adald Trump ad\u00addressed the con\u00adven\u00adtion . Des\u00adpite the signs next to him ur\u00adging politi\u00adcians to \u201c stop fight\u00ading , start fix\u00ading , \u201d he de\u00adlivered his sig\u00adna\u00adture caustic rhet\u00ador\u00adic . All of his op\u00adpon\u00adents , he boas\u00adted , were look\u00ading \u201c lousy \u201d in the polls , Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama had \u201c bombed \u201d his re\u00adcent 60 Minutes in\u00adter\u00adview , and so on . Look\u00ading down at a sheet of pa\u00adper , Trump went through the list of No La\u00adbels \u2019 four over\u00adarch\u00ading policy goals . It soun\u00added like he was read\u00ading them for the first time . \u201c I look at your dif\u00adfer\u00adent things that you have , things that you want to do : \u2018 Cre\u00adate 25 mil\u00adlion jobs. \u2019 \u2026 \u2018 Bal\u00adance the fed\u00ader\u00adal budget by \u2019 \u201d \u2014he paused , scoff\u00ading in\u00adcred\u00adu\u00adlously\u2014 \u201c 2030 ! 2030 ? That \u2019 s an easy one. \u201d A tense ques\u00adtion-and-an\u00adswer peri\u00adod fol\u00adlowed his speech . One wo\u00adman asked wheth\u00ader Trump was con\u00adcerned that some of the di\u00advis\u00adive lan\u00adguage he uses on the cam\u00adpaign trail un\u00adder\u00admines his abil\u00adity to solve prob\u00adlems . \u201c I went to Ivy League schools , \u201d he re\u00adspon\u00added . \u201c I know what \u2019 s di\u00advis\u00adive , and I know what \u2019 s not di\u00advis\u00adive. \u201d In total , eight pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adates\u2014Trump , Lind\u00adsey Gra\u00adham , Chris Christie , Mar\u00adtin O \u2019 Mal\u00adley , Bernie Sanders , George Pa\u00adtaki , John Kasich , and Jim Webb\u2014ad\u00addressed the group . None of the oth\u00aders were as com\u00adbat\u00adive as Trump , and many spoke to the vir\u00adtues of com\u00adprom\u00adise . ( Nearly every\u00adone , it seemed , felt com\u00adpelled to in\u00advoke the bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan spir\u00adit of Ron\u00adald Re\u00adagan and Tip O \u2019 Neill . ) But the es\u00adsen\u00adtial mes\u00adsage of many of the speeches seemed to boil down to : Here \u2019 s my agenda ; I hope it can hap\u00adpen via com\u00adprom\u00adise .\nIn the age of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders , of Fox News and MSNBC , of total partisan warfare at all levels of government , No Labels is , to put it mildly , out of step with the zeitgeist of U.S. politics .\nDur\u00ading the af\u00adter\u00adnoon , after some of the can\u00addid\u00adates had spoken , I found my\u00adself talk\u00ading to Ju\u00adlie Mc\u00adCutcheon , a re\u00adtired com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram\u00admer from Marl\u00adbor\u00adough , New Hamp\u00adshire . She \u2019 d come with a friend , who had got\u00adten an email about the con\u00adven\u00adtion from a cam\u00adpaign-fin\u00adance-re\u00adform group . Mc\u00adCutcheon seemed frus\u00adtrated at just how out of sync some of the can\u00addid\u00adates were with the No La\u00adbels mes\u00adsage . \u201c It says a lot about the can\u00addid\u00adates that some of them ap\u00adpar\u00adently didn \u2019 t read the as\u00adsign\u00adment , \u201d she said . \u201c Be\u00adcause they didn \u2019 t do the home\u00adwork. \u201d It also , however , said a lot about No La\u00adbels and the up\u00adhill battle the group is fight\u00ading . In the age of Don\u00adald Trump and Bernie Sanders , of Fox News and MS\u00adN\u00adBC , of total par\u00adtis\u00adan war\u00adfare at all levels of gov\u00adern\u00adment , No La\u00adbels is , to put it mildly , out of step with the zeit\u00adgeist of U.S. polit\u00adics . \u201c I think there are some winds that we \u2019 re try\u00ading to make pro\u00adgress against , \u201d former White House chief of staff and No La\u00adbels vice chair Mack McLarty told me . \u201c I think the way we fin\u00adance our cam\u00adpaigns , ger\u00adry\u00adman\u00adder\u00ading and how we di\u00advide our dis\u00adtricts , \u2026 a more di\u00advided Amer\u00adica , the In\u00adter\u00adnet re\u00adin\u00adfor\u00adcing ideas and so forth , the cable chan\u00adnels that cer\u00adtainly re\u00adin\u00adforce a silo\u2026 \u201d He drif\u00adted off , be\u00adfore adding : \u201c We \u2019 re try\u00ading to pen\u00adet\u00adrate through that. \u201d No La\u00adbels is hardly alone : They are just one of nu\u00admer\u00adous or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions that have made it their mis\u00adsion\u2014maybe ideal\u00adist\u00adic\u00adally , maybe ab\u00adsurdly\u2014to end or at least mit\u00adig\u00adate polit\u00adic\u00adal po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion . I re\u00adcently talked to the people be\u00adhind a num\u00adber of these groups . Of the 11 or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions I spoke with , most had star\u00adted in the last five years ; the old\u00adest began in 2006 . Each has slightly dif\u00adfer\u00adent ideas on what \u2019 s caus\u00ading hy\u00adper\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship , what should be done to fix it , and even what to call their pre\u00adferred al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive . ( Some pro\u00admote \u201c de\u00adpol\u00adar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion , \u201d oth\u00aders fa\u00advor the term \u201c bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship , \u201d while still oth\u00aders claim to ad\u00advance \u201c trans\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship. \u201d ) But all share a ba\u00adsic out\u00adlook that sees ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal di\u00advi\u00adsion and polit\u00adic\u00adal grid\u00adlock as ur\u00adgent prob\u00adlems . What I hoped to learn was how , pre\u00adcisely , these groups are go\u00ading about tack\u00adling their seem\u00adingly her\u00adculean task\u2014and wheth\u00ader any of it can ac\u00adtu\u00adally work . U.S. POLIT\u00adICS , AS every\u00adone knows , is in\u00adsanely po\u00adlar\u00adized . Ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a 2014 Pew study , voters have more in\u00adtense an\u00adim\u00ados\u00adity for the oth\u00ader side than at any point in the last 20 years ; many even think of those in the op\u00adpos\u00ading party as a \u201c threat to the na\u00adtion \u2019 s well-be\u00ading. \u201d Amer\u00adic\u00adans are balkan\u00adized geo\u00adgraph\u00adic\u00adally , too . \u201c We have built a coun\u00adtry where every\u00adone can choose the neigh\u00adbors ( and church and news shows ) most com\u00adpat\u00adible with his or her life\u00adstyle and be\u00adliefs , \u201d the journ\u00adal\u00adist Bill Bish\u00adop writes in The Big Sort : Why the Clus\u00adter\u00ading of Like-Minded Amer\u00adica Is Tear\u00ading Us Apart . \u201c And we are liv\u00ading with the con\u00adsequences of this se\u00adgreg\u00ada\u00adtion by way of life : pock\u00adets of like-minded cit\u00adizens that have be\u00adcome so ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adally in\u00adbred that we don \u2019 t know , can \u2019 t un\u00adder\u00adstand , and can barely con\u00adceive of \u2018 those people \u2019 who live just a few miles away . \u201d\nWith\u00adin the ma\u00adchinery of the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment , mean\u00adwhile , po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion has be\u00adcome a giv\u00aden . The num\u00adber of im\u00adport\u00adant is\u00adsues stuck in con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal grid\u00adlock , ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a Brook\u00adings In\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion re\u00adport from last year , has ris\u00aden stead\u00adily over the past half-cen\u00adtury . The groups that are seek\u00ading to fight these trends of\u00adfer a broad range of pos\u00adsible ap\u00adproaches\u2014loc\u00adal and na\u00adtion\u00adal , per\u00adson\u00adal and sweep\u00ading , grass\u00adroots and elite . One non\u00adprofit , called the Vil\u00adlage Square , is try\u00ading to re\u00adcre\u00adate com\u00admunity meet\u00ading places that once oc\u00adcurred more nat\u00adur\u00adally . The or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion\u2014which is based in Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee , Flor\u00adida , but has chapters in four cit\u00adies\u2014hopes to build \u201c a cen\u00adter of grav\u00adity in\u00adside a com\u00admunity , \u201d says Liz Joyn\u00ader , the group \u2019 s ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive dir\u00adect\u00ador . \u201c We cre\u00adate that space where neigh\u00adbors con\u00adnect up with each oth\u00ader to cre\u00adate the civic glue that makes demo\u00adcracy work. \u201d It \u2019 s al\u00admost like so\u00adcial-net\u00adwork\u00ading in real life\u2014so it makes sense that the group is fun\u00added , in part , by Linked\u00adIn co-founder Re\u00adid Hoff\u00adman . Earli\u00ader this month , the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion ar\u00adranged for a 504-foot-long table that would stretch down two city blocks in down\u00adtown Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee . At the gath\u00ader\u00ading , dubbed the \u201c Longest Table , \u201d 400 loc\u00adal res\u00adid\u00adents mingled over bar\u00adbe\u00adcue .

A sim\u00adil\u00adarly grass\u00adroots pro\u00adgram is called Liv\u00ading Room Con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtions . Fun\u00added by grants from the Hew\u00adlett Found\u00ada\u00adtion , the Cali\u00adfor\u00adnia En\u00addow\u00adment , and oth\u00ader smal\u00adler found\u00ada\u00adtions , the ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive en\u00adcour\u00adages av\u00ader\u00adage Amer\u00adic\u00adans from op\u00adpos\u00adite ends of the ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal spec\u00adtrum to get to\u00adgeth\u00ader for can\u00addid con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtions about polit\u00adic\u00adally charged top\u00adics : edu\u00adca\u00adtion , men\u00adtal health , race , in\u00adcar\u00adcer\u00ada\u00adtion .\n\u201c This is an entrepreneurial startup enterprise , \u201d Jon Huntsman says . \u201c And like any entrepreneurial startup enterprise , there \u2019 s no guarantee that you \u2019 re going to get to the promised land . \u201d\nJoan Blades\u2014a former di\u00advorce me\u00addi\u00adat\u00ador and co-founder of the lib\u00ader\u00adal group Mo\u00adve\u00adOn.org\u2014co-foun\u00added Liv\u00ading Room Con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtions in 2010 .

Blades may come from the left , but oth\u00ader anti-po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion ef\u00adforts have ori\u00adgin\u00adated on the right . Dav\u00adid Blanken\u00adhorn of the right-of-cen\u00adter In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Amer\u00adic\u00adan Val\u00adues has launched a new ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive called Bet\u00adter An\u00adgels , which , among oth\u00ader ef\u00adforts , is es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00ading an in\u00addex of de\u00adpol\u00adar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion ( sim\u00adil\u00adar to the coun\u00adtry \u2019 s eco\u00adnom\u00adic in\u00addic\u00adat\u00adors ) and pre\u00adpar\u00ading a na\u00adtion\u00adal re\u00adport on the prob\u00adlem of hy\u00adper\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship . \u201c There is something with\u00adin us that wants to be a com\u00admunity , \u201d he says . \u201c There \u2019 s a part of us that real\u00adizes that we can do bet\u00adter than this , and we should do bet\u00adter than this. \u201d The Boulder-based In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Cul\u00adtur\u00adal Evol\u00adu\u00adtion is tak\u00ading a more philo\u00adsoph\u00adic\u00adal ap\u00adproach to po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion . The group is pub\u00adlish\u00ading pa\u00adpers , such as one called \u201c De\u00adpol\u00adar\u00adiz\u00ading the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Mind , \u201d and hold\u00ading con\u00adclaves with \u201c in\u00adflu\u00aden\u00adcers \u201d to brain\u00adstorm solu\u00adtions for what Steve McIn\u00adtosh , the group \u2019 s pres\u00adid\u00adent , de\u00adscribes as a cul\u00adtur\u00adal prob\u00adlem . \u201c Our tech\u00adnique is to find ex\u00adist\u00aden\u00adtial prob\u00adlems that can \u2019 t be solved at the level of think\u00ading that cre\u00adated them\u2014Ein\u00adstein \u2019 s fam\u00adous quote , \u201d he says . \u201c Those ex\u00adist\u00aden\u00adtial prob\u00adlems are where open\u00adings for new ways of think\u00ading ex\u00adist. \u201d This wasn \u2019 t the only time that par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar Ein\u00adstein quote came up dur\u00ading my con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtions with ad\u00advoc\u00adates of bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship . The Bridge Al\u00adli\u00adance ( also based in Boulder ) is a sort of meta-bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan group that is seek\u00ading to con\u00adnect all the act\u00adors work\u00ading in the anti-po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion space so they can col\u00adlab\u00ador\u00adate . Co-founder John Stein\u00ader told me , \u201c You can only solve a prob\u00adlem if you \u2019 re in a dif\u00adfer\u00adent kind of con\u00adscious\u00adness \u201d \u2014a dif\u00adfer\u00adent ver\u00adsion of the Ein\u00adstein max\u00adim . \u201c So the polit\u00adic\u00adal con\u00adscious\u00adness that we \u2019 re talk\u00ading about is ba\u00adsic\u00adally a dif\u00adfer\u00adent con\u00adscious\u00adness , or a dif\u00adfer\u00adent aware\u00adness than we read about in the me\u00addia that the polit\u00adic\u00adal parties are of\u00adfer\u00ading. \u201d Then , of course , there are the more tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal Wash\u00ading\u00adton groups . The D.C.-based Bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan Policy Cen\u00adter brings to\u00adgeth\u00ader \u201c prin\u00adcipled , proud , ag\u00adgress\u00adive par\u00adtis\u00adans \u201d to hash out policy solu\u00adtions for tough prob\u00adlems . They \u2019 ve tackled im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion policy , debt re\u00adduc\u00adtion , hous\u00ading , and oth\u00ader areas , with a myri\u00adad of former politi\u00adcians\u2014Tom Daschle , Trent Lott , Con\u00addoleezza Rice , Henry Cis\u00adner\u00ados\u2014lead\u00ading the charge .\nFoun\u00added by four former Sen\u00adate ma\u00adjor\u00adity lead\u00aders , BPC was born out of the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admis\u00adsion on En\u00adergy Policy \u2019 s ad\u00advocacy for a \u201c con\u00adstruct\u00adive cen\u00adter \u201d on en\u00adergy re\u00adform in the early 2000s .

Once they reach a solu\u00adtion , BPC \u2019 s 501 ( c ) 4 lob\u00adbies for the pro\u00adpos\u00adal on the Hill . It \u2019 s a pro\u00adcess , Gru\u00admet says , that \u201c re\u00adflects the ideal\u00adized ima\u00adgin\u00ada\u00adtion of how Con\u00adgress would work \u201d if mem\u00adbers reached across the aisle . In a sim\u00adil\u00adar vein to BPC , the Con\u00adver\u00adgence Cen\u00adter for Policy Res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion brings to\u00adgeth\u00ader stake\u00adhold\u00aders to dive deep in\u00adto long-term pro\u00adjects\u2014tack\u00adling everything from edu\u00adca\u00adtion to U.S.-Pakistan re\u00adla\u00adtions . Maja Kristin , a former lit\u00adig\u00adat\u00ador in Cali\u00adfor\u00adnia and Con\u00adver\u00adgence Cen\u00adter board mem\u00adber who has giv\u00aden close to $ 1 mil\u00adlion to the non\u00adprofit \u2019 s ef\u00adforts , calls that pro\u00adcess \u201c ma\u00adgic. \u201d She ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adenced it her\u00adself , she says , dur\u00ading a meet\u00ading on nu\u00adtri\u00adtion and well\u00adness with Richard Land , pres\u00adid\u00adent of the South\u00adern Evan\u00adgel\u00adic\u00adal Sem\u00adin\u00adary . \u201c I \u2019 m an old fem\u00adin\u00adist , \u201d Kristin told me , ex\u00adplain\u00ading that she knew she wouldn \u2019 t agree with Land on abor\u00adtion rights . But listen\u00ading to him talk about how obesity was af\u00adfect\u00ading the poor in his home state , she real\u00adized , \u201c We may not agree on one sub\u00adject , but boy , we can make head\u00adway on this oth\u00ader sub\u00adject. \u201d There are still oth\u00ader ef\u00adforts afoot . The Na\u00adtion\u00adal In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Civil Dis\u00adcourse , based at the Uni\u00adversity of Ari\u00adzona , works with law\u00admakers in state le\u00adgis\u00adlatures around the coun\u00adtry to pro\u00admote col\u00adlab\u00ador\u00ada\u00adtion between Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats . Be\u00adcause so many Wash\u00ading\u00adton politi\u00adcians start their ca\u00adreers at the state level , ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive dir\u00adect\u00ador Car\u00ado\u00adlyn Lukens\u00admey\u00ader says , \u201c we see that as a pretty high-lever\u00adage , long-term op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to shift some of what \u2019 s hap\u00adpen\u00ading in Con\u00adgress. \u201d There \u2019 s also the Cent\u00adrist Pro\u00adject , which aims to elect five \u201c in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent-minded cent\u00adrist \u201d sen\u00adat\u00adors by 2020 , and the As\u00adpen In\u00adsti\u00adtute Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Pro\u00adgram , a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive that or\u00adgan\u00adizes sum\u00admits between law\u00admakers and policy ex\u00adperts . OF ALL THESE groups , however , No La\u00adbels is the most prom\u00adin\u00adent . The or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion star\u00adted in 2010 as a refuge for Amer\u00adic\u00adans frus\u00adtrated by the di\u00advide between Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats . Its philo\u00adsophy , says Nancy Jac\u00adob\u00adson\u2014the CEO of the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion and a vet\u00ader\u00adan Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic op\u00ader\u00adat\u00adive\u2014is to bring politi\u00adcians in Wash\u00ading\u00adton to\u00adgeth\u00ader around a \u201c new the\u00adory of goal-set\u00adting. \u201d Cur\u00adrently , the group is cru\u00adsad\u00ading on be\u00adhalf of four goals , which to\u00adgeth\u00ader form their \u201c Na\u00adtion\u00adal Stra\u00adtegic Agenda \u201d : Cre\u00adate 25 mil\u00adlion new jobs over the next 10 years ; se\u00adcure So\u00adcial Se\u00adcur\u00adity and Medi\u00adcare for an\u00adoth\u00ader 75 years ; bal\u00adance the fed\u00ader\u00adal budget by 2030 ; and make Amer\u00adica en\u00adergy se\u00adcure by 2024 .\nIn Janu\u00adary , No La\u00adbels will award a Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Seal to each pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adate who signs on to these goals and agrees to hold a meet\u00ading\u2014with\u00adin his or her first 30 days in of\u00adfice\u2014with House and Sen\u00adate lead\u00aders from both parties to start work on at least one of them . If the next pres\u00adid\u00adent has agreed to these con\u00addi\u00adtions , they \u2019 ll have sup\u00adport from mem\u00adbers of the con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00aders Caucus ( the pres\u00adid\u00adent \u2019 s bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan \u201c army on Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill , \u201d Hunts\u00adman ex\u00adplained to me ) . Right now , that caucus con\u00adsists of 70 House mem\u00adbers and three sen\u00adat\u00adors\u2014Flor\u00adida \u2019 s Bill Nel\u00adson , South Dakota \u2019 s John Thune , and New Hamp\u00adshire \u2019 s Kelly Ayotte . More than 1,500 people turned out to No La\u00adbels \u2019 con\u00adven\u00adtion a few weeks ago in New Hamp\u00adshire . Among them were about 300 col\u00adlege stu\u00addents , clad in green \u201c Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader \u201d T-shirts and sta\u00adtioned on bleach\u00aders be\u00adhind the stage , ap\u00adpar\u00adently flaunt\u00ading their youth\u00adful zest for com\u00adprom\u00adise . Every so of\u00adten , speak\u00aders , such as Sen. Cory Gard\u00adner of Col\u00ador\u00adado , en\u00adgaged them in a round of gim\u00admicky call-and-re\u00adsponse ( Speak\u00ader : \u201c What are you do\u00ading ? Prob\u00adlem\u2014 \u201d Stu\u00addents : \u201c Solv\u00ading ! \u201d ) . The stu\u00addents were brought to the con\u00adfer\u00adence from across the coun\u00adtry by No La\u00adbels , with all their travel ex\u00adpenses paid . I spoke to three of them , all of whom have led No La\u00adbels chapters on their cam\u00adpuses\u2014Frank\u00adlin and Mar\u00adshall in Pennsylvania , the Uni\u00adversity of Ari\u00adzona , and the Uni\u00adversity of Texas at Dal\u00adlas . All were con\u00adtac\u00adted by No La\u00adbels and en\u00adcour\u00adaged to start a chapter . En\u00adrico Tre\u00advis\u00adani , a sopho\u00admore at the Uni\u00adversity of Ari\u00adzona , told me that No La\u00adbels got in touch with him about start\u00ading a chapter last school year , after he \u2019 d in\u00adterned with the Na\u00adtion\u00adal In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Civil Dis\u00adcourse . It was es\u00adpe\u00adcially im\u00adport\u00adant to get the group up and run\u00adning by com\u00admence\u00adment , he says , be\u00adcause the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion \u2019 s co-chair Jon Hunts\u00adman was speak\u00ading at the ce\u00adre\u00admony . \u201c Many , many people in my gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion , many mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals , have sort of grown up with this dis\u00addain for the polit\u00adic\u00adal pro\u00adcess be\u00adcause for as long as we can re\u00admem\u00adber , we \u2019 ve seen Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats fight\u00ading each oth\u00ader and not get\u00adting any\u00adthing done , to a large de\u00adgree , es\u00adpe\u00adcially with this grid\u00adlock in Con\u00adgress , \u201d Tre\u00advis\u00adani told me . \u201c It \u2019 s simple , and yet so many people who are in\u00adgrained in the polit\u00adic\u00adal pro\u00adcess don \u2019 t seem to listen , and I think that for people in my gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion , it seems like a simple solu\u00adtion that \u2019 s not only pos\u00adsible but has already gained a lot of trac\u00adtion in Con\u00adgress. \u201d The most con\u00adspicu\u00adous young per\u00adson at the con\u00adfer\u00adence was Zach Fox , a 21-year-old ju\u00adni\u00ador at the Uni\u00adversity of Pennsylvania , who was dressed in a black cape and green span\u00addex bear\u00ading the No La\u00adbels logo . Fox per\u00adforms the du\u00adties of \u201c comedi\u00adan , video\u00adgraph\u00ader , good-look\u00ading per\u00adson in tights \u201d for No La\u00adbels\u2014for which he gets paid $ 1,500 per month . On You\u00adTube , you can find a num\u00adber of videos Fox has made for No La\u00adbels . ( In one , filmed at the Iowa State Fair , he eats fried cheese curd on a stick , goes down a gi\u00adant slide , and asks people who they might vote for in 2016 . The Iow\u00adans in\u00adter\u00adviewed , un\u00adsur\u00adpris\u00adingly , hold vastly dif\u00adfer\u00adent ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal views . It \u2019 s nev\u00ader quite made clear how the ex\u00adist\u00adence of the video con\u00adtrib\u00adutes to the group \u2019 s lofty goals . )\nNo La\u00adbels has 22 paid staffers , with four on the ground in New Hamp\u00adshire . Lead\u00ading up to the con\u00adven\u00adtion , their ground game in the state was fo\u00adcused solely on get\u00adting voters to at\u00adtend the daylong event , which , if you re\u00adgistered in ad\u00advance , was free of charge and in\u00adcluded break\u00adfast and lunch . Now , they \u2019 re fo\u00adcused on build\u00ading \u201c a cam\u00adpaign without a can\u00addid\u00adate , \u201d No La\u00adbels spokes\u00adman Ry\u00adan Clancy told me . Staffers in New Hamp\u00adshire are knock\u00ading on doors , mak\u00ading phone calls , go\u00ading to cam\u00adpaign events , \u201c all the kinds of things you would as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate with a cam\u00adpaign. \u201d And what are the staffers say\u00ading when someone an\u00adswers their knock ? \u201c Either re\u00adcruit\u00ading people in\u00adto the move\u00adment , get\u00adting people to be\u00adcome a part of No La\u00adbels , or to help cre\u00adate the crit\u00adic\u00adal mass to get the can\u00addid\u00adates \u201d to sign on to the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Stra\u00adtegic Agenda , Clancy says . The end game , he ex\u00adplains , is to get a pres\u00adid\u00adent to back the goals of the agenda and the sub\u00adsequent meet\u00ading with Con\u00adgress . Jen\u00adnifer Aaron\u00adson , No La\u00adbels \u2019 New Hamp\u00adshire state co\u00adordin\u00adat\u00ador , told me that the group hopes to get voters to sign on to the \u201c Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Prom\u00adise , \u201d a pledge to only vote for can\u00addid\u00adates with the \u201c Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Seal. \u201d Throughout the con\u00adven\u00adtion , No La\u00adbels stressed the im\u00adport\u00adance of how\u2014as in , how will policy pro\u00adpos\u00adals ac\u00adtu\u00adally be\u00adcome real\u00adity ? The word was even em\u00adblazoned on the hand\u00adbooks they gave out to every at\u00adtendee . But thus far , the mech\u00adan\u00adics of get\u00adting policies en\u00adacted have not been easy for No La\u00adbels . Over the past five years , lan\u00adguage from just two of their pro\u00adposed bills has been in\u00adcor\u00adpor\u00adated in\u00adto law . One , which set a time line for the De\u00adfense and Vet\u00ader\u00adans Af\u00adfairs de\u00adpart\u00adments to merge their on\u00adline re\u00adcords sys\u00adtems , was passed as part of the Na\u00adtion\u00adal De\u00adfense Au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion Act in 2013 . And while Con\u00adgress did pass No La\u00adbels \u2019 \u201c No Budget , No Pay \u201d act\u2014which stip\u00adu\u00adlated that mem\u00adbers wouldn \u2019 t get com\u00adpensated if they didn \u2019 t pass a budget\u2014it proved to be mostly an empty vic\u00adtory : The bill \u2019 s fi\u00adnal lan\u00adguage spe\u00adcified that , should law\u00admakers fail to pass a budget , they would in fact get paid , just not right away . Go\u00ading for\u00adward , even Hunts\u00adman ac\u00adknow\u00adledges the real\u00adity that his group may not suc\u00adceed . \u201c This is an en\u00adtre\u00adpren\u00adeur\u00adi\u00adal star\u00adtup en\u00adter\u00adprise , \u201d he says . \u201c And like any en\u00adtre\u00adpren\u00adeur\u00adi\u00adal star\u00adtup en\u00adter\u00adprise , there \u2019 s no guar\u00adan\u00adtee that you \u2019 re go\u00ading to get to the prom\u00adised land. \u201d AS WITH NO La\u00adbels , many of the 10 oth\u00ader groups I spoke with had trouble point\u00ading to con\u00adcrete res\u00adults . \u201c In Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee , where we \u2019 ve ex\u00adis\u00adted the longest , you can feel it , \u201d says Liz Joyn\u00ader of the Vil\u00adlage Square , ad\u00address\u00ading the ques\u00adtion of how she can meas\u00adure pro\u00adgress . \u201c You can feel it be\u00adcause you can do things like host a Longest Table pro\u00adgram for the very first time and get more than 300 people re\u00adgistered in , like , four hours . There are times in the news\u00adpa\u00adper where I \u2019 ll pick it up and some\u00adbody will have said , in the op-ed , something \u2018 wasn \u2019 t a very Vil\u00adlage Square way to do things. \u2019 \u201d With genu\u00adine , al\u00admost ur\u00adgent con\u00advic\u00adtion , she again de\u00adclares : \u201c You just can feel it . \u201d",
    "content_original": "ON A RE\u00adCENT Sunday even\u00ading in Manchester, New Hamp\u00adshire, 170 people con\u00advened for din\u00adner at the Cur\u00adri\u00ader Mu\u00adseum of Art. Among the at\u00adtendees were Wash\u00ading\u00adton semi-celebrit\u00adies (Joe Lieber\u00adman, Jon Hunts\u00adman, GOP strategist Mark McKin\u00adnon) as well as an odd as\u00adsort\u00adment of D-list Hol\u00adly\u00adwood types (Wayne Knight, who played New\u00adman on Sein\u00adfeld; char\u00adac\u00adter act\u00ador Richard Kind; Dean Nor\u00adris, the broth\u00ader-in-law from Break\u00ading Bad; act\u00adress Rose McGow\u00adan). The din\u00adner served as the kick\u00adoff for the \u201cProb\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Con\u00adven\u00adtion,\u201d the brainchild of the Wash\u00ading\u00adton-based group No La\u00adbels. The goal of the gath\u00ader\u00ading was both straight\u00adfor\u00adward and ex\u00adtraordin\u00adar\u00adily am\u00adbi\u00adtious: to set in mo\u00adtion a plan that would re\u00adduce grid\u00adlock, po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion, and par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship in Wash\u00ading\u00adton. Yet even at this event, it wasn\u2019t al\u00adways pos\u00adsible to keep par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship at bay. At one point dur\u00ading the Sunday night din\u00adner (which cost No La\u00adbels $68 per plate), McGow\u00adan\u2014best known for her role on the early 2000s show Charmed\u2014In\u00ads\u00adtagrammed a video, taken from what ap\u00adpeared to be the angle of her lap. In it, she rolled her eyes and looked gen\u00ader\u00adally dis\u00adgus\u00adted. The cap\u00adtion read: \u201cTell me all about it rich white male re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans.\u201d Minutes later, McGow\u00adan spoke to the group. \u201cWhat I see is a very, very white room,\u201d she scol\u00added. \u201cWhich is shock\u00ading.\u201d She talked for at least a minute about how No La\u00adbels was well-in\u00adten\u00adtioned but had lost its way (while also adding something about how she was a busi\u00adness\u00adwo\u00adman who owned homes in four coun\u00adtries) be\u00adfore one of the group\u2019s co-founders at\u00adtemp\u00adted to cut her off with a tim\u00adid, \u201cWe ap\u00adpre\u00adci\u00adate your com\u00adments.\u201d Pump\u00ading a hand in the air, McGow\u00adan shouted, \u201cAnd I ap\u00adpre\u00adci\u00adate you!\u201d Then she dis\u00adap\u00adpeared in\u00adto the Manchester night.\n\nThe un\u00adwel\u00adcome specters of par\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship and di\u00advis\u00adive\u00adness again hovered the next morn\u00ading, when Don\u00adald Trump ad\u00addressed the con\u00adven\u00adtion. Des\u00adpite the signs next to him ur\u00adging politi\u00adcians to \u201cstop fight\u00ading, start fix\u00ading,\u201d he de\u00adlivered his sig\u00adna\u00adture caustic rhet\u00ador\u00adic. All of his op\u00adpon\u00adents, he boas\u00adted, were look\u00ading \u201clousy\u201d in the polls, Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama had \u201cbombed\u201d his re\u00adcent 60 Minutes in\u00adter\u00adview, and so on. Look\u00ading down at a sheet of pa\u00adper, Trump went through the list of No La\u00adbels\u2019 four over\u00adarch\u00ading policy goals. It soun\u00added like he was read\u00ading them for the first time. \u201cI look at your dif\u00adfer\u00adent things that you have, things that you want to do: \u2018Cre\u00adate 25 mil\u00adlion jobs.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Bal\u00adance the fed\u00ader\u00adal budget by\u2019 \u201d\u2014he paused, scoff\u00ading in\u00adcred\u00adu\u00adlously\u2014\u201c2030! 2030? That\u2019s an easy one.\u201d A tense ques\u00adtion-and-an\u00adswer peri\u00adod fol\u00adlowed his speech. One wo\u00adman asked wheth\u00ader Trump was con\u00adcerned that some of the di\u00advis\u00adive lan\u00adguage he uses on the cam\u00adpaign trail un\u00adder\u00admines his abil\u00adity to solve prob\u00adlems. \u201cI went to Ivy League schools,\u201d he re\u00adspon\u00added. \u201cI know what\u2019s di\u00advis\u00adive, and I know what\u2019s not di\u00advis\u00adive.\u201d In total, eight pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adates\u2014Trump, Lind\u00adsey Gra\u00adham, Chris Christie, Mar\u00adtin O\u2019Mal\u00adley, Bernie Sanders, George Pa\u00adtaki, John Kasich, and Jim Webb\u2014ad\u00addressed the group. None of the oth\u00aders were as com\u00adbat\u00adive as Trump, and many spoke to the vir\u00adtues of com\u00adprom\u00adise. (Nearly every\u00adone, it seemed, felt com\u00adpelled to in\u00advoke the bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan spir\u00adit of Ron\u00adald Re\u00adagan and Tip O\u2019Neill.) But the es\u00adsen\u00adtial mes\u00adsage of many of the speeches seemed to boil down to: Here\u2019s my agenda; I hope it can hap\u00adpen via com\u00adprom\u00adise.\n\nIn the age of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, of Fox News and MSNBC, of total partisan warfare at all levels of government, No Labels is, to put it mildly, out of step with the zeitgeist of U.S. politics.\n\nDur\u00ading the af\u00adter\u00adnoon, after some of the can\u00addid\u00adates had spoken, I found my\u00adself talk\u00ading to Ju\u00adlie Mc\u00adCutcheon, a re\u00adtired com\u00adputer pro\u00adgram\u00admer from Marl\u00adbor\u00adough, New Hamp\u00adshire. She\u2019d come with a friend, who had got\u00adten an email about the con\u00adven\u00adtion from a cam\u00adpaign-fin\u00adance-re\u00adform group. Mc\u00adCutcheon seemed frus\u00adtrated at just how out of sync some of the can\u00addid\u00adates were with the No La\u00adbels mes\u00adsage. \u201cIt says a lot about the can\u00addid\u00adates that some of them ap\u00adpar\u00adently didn\u2019t read the as\u00adsign\u00adment,\u201d she said. \u201cBe\u00adcause they didn\u2019t do the home\u00adwork.\u201d It also, however, said a lot about No La\u00adbels and the up\u00adhill battle the group is fight\u00ading. In the age of Don\u00adald Trump and Bernie Sanders, of Fox News and MS\u00adN\u00adBC, of total par\u00adtis\u00adan war\u00adfare at all levels of gov\u00adern\u00adment, No La\u00adbels is, to put it mildly, out of step with the zeit\u00adgeist of U.S. polit\u00adics. \u201cI think there are some winds that we\u2019re try\u00ading to make pro\u00adgress against,\u201d former White House chief of staff and No La\u00adbels vice chair Mack McLarty told me. \u201cI think the way we fin\u00adance our cam\u00adpaigns, ger\u00adry\u00adman\u00adder\u00ading and how we di\u00advide our dis\u00adtricts, \u2026 a more di\u00advided Amer\u00adica, the In\u00adter\u00adnet re\u00adin\u00adfor\u00adcing ideas and so forth, the cable chan\u00adnels that cer\u00adtainly re\u00adin\u00adforce a silo\u2026\u201d He drif\u00adted off, be\u00adfore adding: \u201cWe\u2019re try\u00ading to pen\u00adet\u00adrate through that.\u201d No La\u00adbels is hardly alone: They are just one of nu\u00admer\u00adous or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions that have made it their mis\u00adsion\u2014maybe ideal\u00adist\u00adic\u00adally, maybe ab\u00adsurdly\u2014to end or at least mit\u00adig\u00adate polit\u00adic\u00adal po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion. I re\u00adcently talked to the people be\u00adhind a num\u00adber of these groups. Of the 11 or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions I spoke with, most had star\u00adted in the last five years; the old\u00adest began in 2006. Each has slightly dif\u00adfer\u00adent ideas on what\u2019s caus\u00ading hy\u00adper\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship, what should be done to fix it, and even what to call their pre\u00adferred al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive. (Some pro\u00admote \u201cde\u00adpol\u00adar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion,\u201d oth\u00aders fa\u00advor the term \u201cbi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship,\u201d while still oth\u00aders claim to ad\u00advance \u201ctrans\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan\u00adship.\u201d) But all share a ba\u00adsic out\u00adlook that sees ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal di\u00advi\u00adsion and polit\u00adic\u00adal grid\u00adlock as ur\u00adgent prob\u00adlems. What I hoped to learn was how, pre\u00adcisely, these groups are go\u00ading about tack\u00adling their seem\u00adingly her\u00adculean task\u2014and wheth\u00ader any of it can ac\u00adtu\u00adally work. U.S. POLIT\u00adICS, AS every\u00adone knows, is in\u00adsanely po\u00adlar\u00adized. Ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a 2014 Pew study, voters have more in\u00adtense an\u00adim\u00ados\u00adity for the oth\u00ader side than at any point in the last 20 years; many even think of those in the op\u00adpos\u00ading party as a \u201cthreat to the na\u00adtion\u2019s well-be\u00ading.\u201d Amer\u00adic\u00adans are balkan\u00adized geo\u00adgraph\u00adic\u00adally, too. \u201cWe have built a coun\u00adtry where every\u00adone can choose the neigh\u00adbors (and church and news shows) most com\u00adpat\u00adible with his or her life\u00adstyle and be\u00adliefs,\u201d the journ\u00adal\u00adist Bill Bish\u00adop writes in The Big Sort: Why the Clus\u00adter\u00ading of Like-Minded Amer\u00adica Is Tear\u00ading Us Apart. \u201cAnd we are liv\u00ading with the con\u00adsequences of this se\u00adgreg\u00ada\u00adtion by way of life: pock\u00adets of like-minded cit\u00adizens that have be\u00adcome so ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adally in\u00adbred that we don\u2019t know, can\u2019t un\u00adder\u00adstand, and can barely con\u00adceive of \u2018those people\u2019 who live just a few miles away.\u201d\n\nWith\u00adin the ma\u00adchinery of the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment, mean\u00adwhile, po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion has be\u00adcome a giv\u00aden.

Be\u00adcause so many Wash\u00ading\u00adton politi\u00adcians start their ca\u00adreers at the state level, ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive dir\u00adect\u00ador Car\u00ado\u00adlyn Lukens\u00admey\u00ader says, \u201cwe see that as a pretty high-lever\u00adage, long-term op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to shift some of what\u2019s hap\u00adpen\u00ading in Con\u00adgress.\u201d There\u2019s also the Cent\u00adrist Pro\u00adject, which aims to elect five \u201cin\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent-minded cent\u00adrist\u201d sen\u00adat\u00adors by 2020, and the As\u00adpen In\u00adsti\u00adtute Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Pro\u00adgram, a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adive that or\u00adgan\u00adizes sum\u00admits between law\u00admakers and policy ex\u00adperts. OF ALL THESE groups, however, No La\u00adbels is the most prom\u00adin\u00adent. The or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion star\u00adted in 2010 as a refuge for Amer\u00adic\u00adans frus\u00adtrated by the di\u00advide between Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats. Its philo\u00adsophy, says Nancy Jac\u00adob\u00adson\u2014the CEO of the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion and a vet\u00ader\u00adan Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic op\u00ader\u00adat\u00adive\u2014is to bring politi\u00adcians in Wash\u00ading\u00adton to\u00adgeth\u00ader around a \u201cnew the\u00adory of goal-set\u00adting.\u201d Cur\u00adrently, the group is cru\u00adsad\u00ading on be\u00adhalf of four goals, which to\u00adgeth\u00ader form their \u201cNa\u00adtion\u00adal Stra\u00adtegic Agenda\u201d: Cre\u00adate 25 mil\u00adlion new jobs over the next 10 years; se\u00adcure So\u00adcial Se\u00adcur\u00adity and Medi\u00adcare for an\u00adoth\u00ader 75 years; bal\u00adance the fed\u00ader\u00adal budget by 2030; and make Amer\u00adica en\u00adergy se\u00adcure by 2024.\n\nIn Janu\u00adary, No La\u00adbels will award a Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Seal to each pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adate who signs on to these goals and agrees to hold a meet\u00ading\u2014with\u00adin his or her first 30 days in of\u00adfice\u2014with House and Sen\u00adate lead\u00aders from both parties to start work on at least one of them. If the next pres\u00adid\u00adent has agreed to these con\u00addi\u00adtions, they\u2019ll have sup\u00adport from mem\u00adbers of the con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Prob\u00adlem Solv\u00aders Caucus (the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan \u201carmy on Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill,\u201d Hunts\u00adman ex\u00adplained to me). Right now, that caucus con\u00adsists of 70 House mem\u00adbers and three sen\u00adat\u00adors\u2014Flor\u00adida\u2019s Bill Nel\u00adson, South Dakota\u2019s John Thune, and New Hamp\u00adshire\u2019s Kelly Ayotte. More than 1,500 people turned out to No La\u00adbels\u2019 con\u00adven\u00adtion a few weeks ago in New Hamp\u00adshire. Among them were about 300 col\u00adlege stu\u00addents, clad in green \u201cProb\u00adlem Solv\u00ader\u201d T-shirts and sta\u00adtioned on bleach\u00aders be\u00adhind the stage, ap\u00adpar\u00adently flaunt\u00ading their youth\u00adful zest for com\u00adprom\u00adise. Every so of\u00adten, speak\u00aders, such as Sen. Cory Gard\u00adner of Col\u00ador\u00adado, en\u00adgaged them in a round of gim\u00admicky call-and-re\u00adsponse (Speak\u00ader: \u201cWhat are you do\u00ading? Prob\u00adlem\u2014\u201d Stu\u00addents: \u201cSolv\u00ading!\u201d). The stu\u00addents were brought to the con\u00adfer\u00adence from across the coun\u00adtry by No La\u00adbels, with all their travel ex\u00adpenses paid. I spoke to three of them, all of whom have led No La\u00adbels chapters on their cam\u00adpuses\u2014Frank\u00adlin and Mar\u00adshall in Pennsylvania, the Uni\u00adversity of Ari\u00adzona, and the Uni\u00adversity of Texas at Dal\u00adlas. All were con\u00adtac\u00adted by No La\u00adbels and en\u00adcour\u00adaged to start a chapter. En\u00adrico Tre\u00advis\u00adani, a sopho\u00admore at the Uni\u00adversity of Ari\u00adzona, told me that No La\u00adbels got in touch with him about start\u00ading a chapter last school year, after he\u2019d in\u00adterned with the Na\u00adtion\u00adal In\u00adsti\u00adtute for Civil Dis\u00adcourse. It was es\u00adpe\u00adcially im\u00adport\u00adant to get the group up and run\u00adning by com\u00admence\u00adment, he says, be\u00adcause the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion\u2019s co-chair Jon Hunts\u00adman was speak\u00ading at the ce\u00adre\u00admony. \u201cMany, many people in my gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion, many mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals, have sort of grown up with this dis\u00addain for the polit\u00adic\u00adal pro\u00adcess be\u00adcause for as long as we can re\u00admem\u00adber, we\u2019ve seen Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and Demo\u00adcrats fight\u00ading each oth\u00ader and not get\u00adting any\u00adthing done, to a large de\u00adgree, es\u00adpe\u00adcially with this grid\u00adlock in Con\u00adgress,\u201d Tre\u00advis\u00adani told me. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, and yet so many people who are in\u00adgrained in the polit\u00adic\u00adal pro\u00adcess don\u2019t seem to listen, and I think that for people in my gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion, it seems like a simple solu\u00adtion that\u2019s not only pos\u00adsible but has already gained a lot of trac\u00adtion in Con\u00adgress.\u201d The most con\u00adspicu\u00adous young per\u00adson at the con\u00adfer\u00adence was Zach Fox, a 21-year-old ju\u00adni\u00ador at the Uni\u00adversity of Pennsylvania, who was dressed in a black cape and green span\u00addex bear\u00ading the No La\u00adbels logo. Fox per\u00adforms the du\u00adties of \u201ccomedi\u00adan, video\u00adgraph\u00ader, good-look\u00ading per\u00adson in tights\u201d for No La\u00adbels\u2014for which he gets paid $1,500 per month. On You\u00adTube, you can find a num\u00adber of videos Fox has made for No La\u00adbels. (In one, filmed at the Iowa State Fair, he eats fried cheese curd on a stick, goes down a gi\u00adant slide, and asks people who they might vote for in 2016. The Iow\u00adans in\u00adter\u00adviewed, un\u00adsur\u00adpris\u00adingly, hold vastly dif\u00adfer\u00adent ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal views. It\u2019s nev\u00ader quite made clear how the ex\u00adist\u00adence of the video con\u00adtrib\u00adutes to the group\u2019s lofty goals.)\n\nNo La\u00adbels has 22 paid staffers, with four on the ground in New Hamp\u00adshire. Lead\u00ading up to the con\u00adven\u00adtion, their ground game in the state was fo\u00adcused solely on get\u00adting voters to at\u00adtend the daylong event, which, if you re\u00adgistered in ad\u00advance, was free of charge and in\u00adcluded break\u00adfast and lunch. Now, they\u2019re fo\u00adcused on build\u00ading \u201ca cam\u00adpaign without a can\u00addid\u00adate,\u201d No La\u00adbels spokes\u00adman Ry\u00adan Clancy told me. Staffers in New Hamp\u00adshire are knock\u00ading on doors, mak\u00ading phone calls, go\u00ading to cam\u00adpaign events, \u201call the kinds of things you would as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate with a cam\u00adpaign.\u201d And what are the staffers say\u00ading when someone an\u00adswers their knock? \u201cEither re\u00adcruit\u00ading people in\u00adto the move\u00adment, get\u00adting people to be\u00adcome a part of No La\u00adbels, or to help cre\u00adate the crit\u00adic\u00adal mass to get the can\u00addid\u00adates\u201d to sign on to the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Stra\u00adtegic Agenda, Clancy says. The end game, he ex\u00adplains, is to get a pres\u00adid\u00adent to back the goals of the agenda and the sub\u00adsequent meet\u00ading with Con\u00adgress. Jen\u00adnifer Aaron\u00adson, No La\u00adbels\u2019 New Hamp\u00adshire state co\u00adordin\u00adat\u00ador, told me that the group hopes to get voters to sign on to the \u201cProb\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Prom\u00adise,\u201d a pledge to only vote for can\u00addid\u00adates with the \u201cProb\u00adlem Solv\u00ader Seal.\u201d Throughout the con\u00adven\u00adtion, No La\u00adbels stressed the im\u00adport\u00adance of how\u2014as in, how will policy pro\u00adpos\u00adals ac\u00adtu\u00adally be\u00adcome real\u00adity? The word was even em\u00adblazoned on the hand\u00adbooks they gave out to every at\u00adtendee. But thus far, the mech\u00adan\u00adics of get\u00adting policies en\u00adacted have not been easy for No La\u00adbels. Over the past five years, lan\u00adguage from just two of their pro\u00adposed bills has been in\u00adcor\u00adpor\u00adated in\u00adto law. One, which set a time line for the De\u00adfense and Vet\u00ader\u00adans Af\u00adfairs de\u00adpart\u00adments to merge their on\u00adline re\u00adcords sys\u00adtems, was passed as part of the Na\u00adtion\u00adal De\u00adfense Au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion Act in 2013. And while Con\u00adgress did pass No La\u00adbels\u2019 \u201cNo Budget, No Pay\u201d act\u2014which stip\u00adu\u00adlated that mem\u00adbers wouldn\u2019t get com\u00adpensated if they didn\u2019t pass a budget\u2014it proved to be mostly an empty vic\u00adtory: The bill\u2019s fi\u00adnal lan\u00adguage spe\u00adcified that, should law\u00admakers fail to pass a budget, they would in fact get paid, just not right away. Go\u00ading for\u00adward, even Hunts\u00adman ac\u00adknow\u00adledges the real\u00adity that his group may not suc\u00adceed. \u201cThis is an en\u00adtre\u00adpren\u00adeur\u00adi\u00adal star\u00adtup en\u00adter\u00adprise,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd like any en\u00adtre\u00adpren\u00adeur\u00adi\u00adal star\u00adtup en\u00adter\u00adprise, there\u2019s no guar\u00adan\u00adtee that you\u2019re go\u00ading to get to the prom\u00adised land.\u201d AS WITH NO La\u00adbels, many of the 10 oth\u00ader groups I spoke with had trouble point\u00ading to con\u00adcrete res\u00adults. \u201cIn Tal\u00adl\u00ada\u00adhassee, where we\u2019ve ex\u00adis\u00adted the longest, you can feel it,\u201d says Liz Joyn\u00ader of the Vil\u00adlage Square, ad\u00address\u00ading the ques\u00adtion of how she can meas\u00adure pro\u00adgress. \u201cYou can feel it be\u00adcause you can do things like host a Longest Table pro\u00adgram for the very first time and get more than 300 people re\u00adgistered in, like, four hours. There are times in the news\u00adpa\u00adper where I\u2019ll pick it up and some\u00adbody will have said, in the op-ed, something \u2018wasn\u2019t a very Vil\u00adlage Square way to do things.\u2019 \u201d With genu\u00adine, al\u00admost ur\u00adgent con\u00advic\u00adtion, she again de\u00adclares: \u201cYou just can feel it.\u201d",
