He currently has a 2 in 3 ( 64 percent ) chance of winning the most votes , while former South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg has a 3 in 10 ( 30 percent ) chance . We actually have a pretty good idea of what \u2019 s happening in New Hampshire , too , as those five most recent polls actually agree more than they initially appear to . Let \u2019 s run through them :\nAt first glance , these polls appear to show a 10-point Sanders lead , a 7-point Sanders lead , a 4-point Sanders lead , a 3-point Sanders lead and a 2-point Sanders lead . How to reconcile this ? This is where it comes in very handy to be familiar with what these pollsters have said in the past . And as it turns out , UNH , Emerson College and RKM have all tended to show higher numbers for Sanders than other pollsters have , and Suffolk University has historically tended to show lower numbers for Sanders than other pollsters have .\nFor example , based on the degree to which Emerson has overestimated Sanders in the past , our model treats his 30 percent in that poll as more like 25 percent once we adjust for house effects . And his 24 percent in that Suffolk poll is actually closer to 27 percent in our model .\nSo when you make these adjustments to the five polls above , a more consistent picture of the New Hampshire primary emerges : Sanders probably leads by about 5 points , although the RKM poll remains an outlier \u2014 it suggests that Buttigieg may actually be neck and neck with Sanders .\nSanders has a pretty consistent New Hampshire lead Results of the five most recent polls of the New Hampshire Democratic primary for Sanders and Buttigieg , adjusted by house effects Raw Results Adjusted Results Pollster Sanders Buttigieg Margin Sanders Buttigieg Margin Emerson 30 % 20 % Sanders +10 25 % 20 % Sanders +4 Suffolk 24 22 Sanders +2 27 22 Sanders +5 UNH 28 21 Sanders +7 26 21 Sanders +5 YouGov 29 25 Sanders +4 29 24 Sanders +5 RKM 23 20 Sanders +3 21 23 Buttigieg +2 Source : Polls\nOf course , with still a few days left until the primary , 5 points wouldn \u2019 t be a safe lead for Sanders . But it \u2019 s notable that Buttigieg \u2019 s upward movement in the polls , which had been extremely evident in previous installments of the Emerson and Suffolk tracking polls , appears to have stalled out . From the Feb. 6-7 edition to the Feb. 7-8 edition of the Emerson poll , Buttigieg \u2019 s vote share , after days of steady increases , went from 24 percent to 20 percent . And in the Suffolk tracker , Buttigieg went from 11 percent in the Feb. 2-3 installment to a high of 25 percent in the Feb. 6-7 installment , only to fall back to 22 percent in this latest poll . Although these drops are all within the margin of error , we can at least say that Buttigieg \u2019 s climb has not continued . And Sanders \u2019 s vote shares have been quite consistent throughout the life of both tracking polls .\nAnother wild card is how far behind Warren is . Her 9 percent performance in the CNN/UNH poll was eyebrow-raising \u2014 but she got nearly double that support in the YouGov/CBS News and RKM polls . Here , house effects once again help explain some of the discrepancy , although not all of it . YouGov has been high on Warren all cycle , so our model thinks her 17 percent performance in that poll is more like 14 percent . Same with RKM \u2014 our model adjusts her 16 percent in that poll down to 15 percent . And UNH has slightly underestimated Warren in previous polls , so our model is treating her 9 percent in the UNH poll as closer to 10 percent .\nBy contrast , all the recent polls have had pretty disappointing numbers for Biden ( between 10 and 14 percent ) . Factor it all in , and Warren is now ever so slightly ahead of Biden in our New Hampshire polling average , 13.1 percent to 12.7 percent . Needless to say , a second consecutive fourth-place finish ( after Iowa ) could create real doubts about the viability of Biden \u2019 s campaign .\nOverall , Sanders remains the most likely candidate to reach a majority of pledged delegates , according to our national forecast . He has a 2 in 5 ( 44 percent ) chance of doing so . The next most likely candidate is Biden , with a 1 in 5 ( 20 percent ) chance \u2014 however , a scenario in which no one achieves a pledged-delegate majority is even more likely , at 1 in 4 ( 25 percent ) .\nHowever , these numbers are in a kind of suspended animation , as we haven \u2019 t seen any national polls that have been conducted since Feb. 5 , a time when the results out of Iowa were still very much in limbo ( in fairness , they still are ) . Our model will likely react quite strongly to the next few national polls , as we get a much clearer standing of how Iowa and , by that point , maybe New Hampshire , have affected the national race .",
